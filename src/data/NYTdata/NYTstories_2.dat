{"text": "When an announcement is made that a singer is sick but will perform anyway, listener sympathy is sought for any potential flaws. But there was no evidence that Sondra Radvanovsky had a cold, as had been indicated, during her magnificent rendering of the title role of Donizettis Maria Stuarda on Friday evening, when David McVicars production returned to the Metropolitan Opera.Ms. Radvanovsky will perform the bravura feat of singing Donizettis three Tudor queens in one season, mirroring Beverly Sillss achievement at New York City Opera in the 1970s. Ms. Radvanovsky already made a strong impression as the title character in Anna Bolena and made an equally vivid impact in Maria Stuarda, based on a Friedrich Schiller play that explores the rivalry between Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots. The opera includes a few fictitious elements, like a historically inaccurate love triangle and a dramatically juicy confrontation in which Mary calls Elizabeth a vile bastard.Ms. Radvanovksys voice sounded huge and radiant in the tender O nube! Che lieve per laria, her reminiscence about France and freedom. She navigated the coloratura hurdles with ease throughout, her shading, dynamic control and expressive nuance rendering the confession scene particularly potent. Her graceful femininity was in stark contrast to the ungainly movements of Elza van den Heevers Elisabetta, a character portrayed in this production as an awkwardly masculine figure and whose emotive, jealous manipulations were brilliantly rendered by Ms. van den Heever.The male roles were also convincingly portrayed, with Celso Albelo a passionate Leicester, Patrick Carfizzi a sonorous-voiced Cecil and the booming bass of Kwangchul Youn as Talbot, particularly alluring in the confession scene.The chorus sang beautifully in the gorgeous Act III prayer. The deceptively simple om-pah-pah orchestration needs a buoyancy that Riccardo Frizza mostly provided, momentum only occasionally flagging.The sets are simple, traditional and effective. The blood-red wall of Queen Elizabeths court is a stark contrast with the white-costumed courtiers and creepy, cavorting jesters; the martyrs red of Marys dress as she ascends to her death is a splash of color in the suitably gloomy sets of the final scene. When Ms. Radvanovsky sings Elizabeth I in Roberto Devereux (the final opera of the trilogy) later this season, at least the heads rolling wont be hers."}

What role, if any, do board games (or video games) play in spending time with family and friends?In In Toronto Cafes, Board Games Rule, Lynn Freehill-Maye writes:In walkable Toronto, every major street seems to offer a space for playing old-fashioned tabletop games, with drinks and snacks on the side. Several, like Castle Board Game Cafe near the University of Toronto, evoke dorm lounges with plain chairs and soft couches. There are so many of these game rooms in Toronto that the popular metro culture site BlogTO named its top 20 local board-game cafes two years ago, and commenters have been noting new ones ever since. Toronto has become a model of how popular these games can become across a single city. At least a dozen dedicated board-game cafes have popped up around the United States, including in Manhattan, Boston and Los Angeles.More than the Canadian winters fuel the cafes ubiquity here, cafe owners agree. Certainly geek culture has grown more mainstream. The TV blockbuster Game of Thrones and its board game variations play a role. European strategy games like the Settlers of Catan have carved inroads into the North American market. And the irreverent Cards Against Humanity has become such a runaway hit that its stock at Snakes & Lattes Annex takes up an entire sales wall. The cafe hosts monthly game developer nights so creators can test the next big things. Weve seen the evolution in Canada, said Aaron Zack, a Snakes & Lattes partner. Its not about labeling yourself as a geek. Its literally about having fun with your friends.Students: Read the entire article, then tell us   What do you think draws people to game rooms like Snakes & Lattes Annex?  Have you ever been to a cafe or shop that has space devoted to playing board games? If so, how do your experiences compare to those described in the article?

{"text": "AMES, Iowa   Tim Recker has been growing corn in this state his whole life, and using his crops to make ethanol almost as long, at first by the jar for his trucks, now by the barrel for the nation. That is in large part because Congress in 2005 mandated that oil refiners blend ethanol into gasoline.When I look out my window and see farms that have built and expanded and improved, its because of the ethanol mandate, Mr. Recker said from his farm in Arlington, Iowa. Mr. Recker, a Republican, said his decision at the presidential caucuses on Monday would be driven by what candidates have said about the 2005 law, which created the Renewable Fuel Standard.But beyond the borders of a state with outsize importance in the selection of presidents, ethanol may be losing its grip on the body politic. Energy policy experts, advocates in the fight on poverty and even other farmers say a law that has been a boon for Iowa has been a boondoggle to the rest of the country. The ethanol mandate has driven up food costs while failing to deliver its promised environmental benefits. Rising domestic oil production and a global energy glut have all but nullified the pitch that ethanol would help wean the country off foreign oil.And now a powerful coalition including oil companies, environmentalists, grocery manufacturers, livestock farmers and humanitarian advocates is pushing Congress to weaken or repeal the mandate. As soon as this week, the Senate could vote on a measure to roll back the Renewable Fuel Standard, just days after the Iowa caucuses close and the issue largely goes to rest for another four years.Even here, as Iowa urbanizes and diversifies, ethanol may be losing its once-powerful hold, some political consultants say. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of the Republican front-runners in Iowa, has called for an end to subsidies for all forms of energy, as well as a five-year phasing out of the renewable fuel mandate that created the ethanol economy here.That position drew an unusual repudiation from Iowas governor, Terry E. Branstad, a Republican who has not endorsed any candidate. It would be a big mistake for Iowa to support him, Mr. Branstad told reporters at a forum held by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.At the same forum, the other front-runner, Donald J. Trump, said he was 100 percent behind the ethanol mandate and would even support increasing it further.Culturally, anything that supports corn is seen as good, said Bruce Babcock, an economist at Iowa State University, pondering whether ethanols grip here was slipping. But if Ted Cruz wins the caucus, theres your answer.Beyond presidential politics, the weight of opinion is swinging against ethanol, sometimes virulently.No genuine Republican would be in favor of increasing an artificial, demand-creating, crony-capitalism measure like the Renewable Fuel Standard, said Thomas Elam, the president of FarmEcon, an independent economic consulting firm in Carmel, Ind. Its a socialistic, left-wing liberal position. That is so far against fundamental Republican principles of market economics, it shows that Donald Trump will say whatever it takes to get votes in Iowa.When the Renewable Fuel Standard was enacted, lawmakers hoped to ease the nations dependence on foreign oil while promoting a low-carbon, climate-friendly alternative. It was viewed as such a success that Congress increased the mandate in 2007: The nations gasoline refiners must buy and blend an increasing amount of ethanol every year, rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022 from 15 billion now. Only the first 15 billion gallons are supposed to come from corn. The rest of the ethanol is mandated to come from nonfood crops like switch grass, to prevent ethanol from driving up food costs.But doubts are growing. A number of scientific studies have shown that the environmental benefits of corn ethanol are limited, reducing carbon dioxide only slightly compared with conventional gasoline, partly because a large amount of fuel goes into growing corn, including in fertilizers and farm equipment.Since the laws passage, breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have led to a boom in domestic oil production. The United States is now exporting oil. But no similar breakthrough in ethanol technology has advanced the industry. Last year, corn ethanol producers easily met the 15-billion-gallon production requirement, but refiners have not been able to make cleaner, noncorn biofuel on a cheap, commercial scale.Youve got a standard that is not able to be met, said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, the chairwoman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. So you either reform it or get rid of it.In Iowa, the mandate has attracted major employers like Dow and DuPont, which produce ethanol. Nearly all of the states approximately 40 ethanol refiners use locally grown corn to produce about four billion gallons annually. Since the laws passage, the price of corn has more than doubled, to an average of $4.11 per bushel in 2014 from an average of $1.96 per bushel in 2005. Between 2011 and 2013, it climbed to $6 per bushel.If you live in Iowa in a nice house, and send your kids to good schools, its because of ethanol, said Eric Hakmiller, the president of Lincolnway Energy, an ethanol plant in Nevada, Iowa.But high corn prices have raised the cost of livestock feed, and in turn have made meat and dairy more expensive for consumers.Its a tax on people who eat food, said Todd Simmons, the chairman of the National Chicken Council and the chief executive of Simmons Foods, a poultry producer in Siloam Springs, Ark.A 2013 report by FarmEcon, Mr. Elams consulting firm, said that in the eight years since the passage of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the average annual cost of groceries for a family of four had grown by about $2,000.Mandates for food-based biofuels like corn ethanol increase hunger, said Kelly Stone, a policy analyst with ActionAid USA, a nonprofit advocacy group working to end poverty.An already subsidized farm economy has found another subsidy. The Environmental Working Group, a Washington advocacy organization, says Iowa corn farmers received $15 billion in federal farm subsidies between 1995 and 2012.The ethanol mandate is obsolete, said Scott Faber, the groups vice president of government affairs. Its the toothpick on the subsidy club sandwich.Iowa has become less dependent on ethanol, and voters who are not directly dependent on ethanol appear to be less concerned about the fate of the mandate.Its created a lot of jobs, Michael Johnston, a truck driver and an independent, said over a beer at Dotties Landmark Bar and Grill in Polk City, discussing his caucus vote. I like it the way it is. But ethanol wouldnt be the deciding factor. Its only one part of the economy. I care about taxes, national security.At a Pizza Ranch outside Ames, Kathleen Johns, a retired factory worker and a Republican, said Social Security was her biggest concern, not ethanol. I know about it, but Im not worried about it too much, she said."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   The United States has carried out at least a dozen operations  including commando raids and airstrikes  in the past three weeks against militants in Afghanistan aligned with the Islamic State, expanding the Obama administrations military campaign against the terrorist group beyond Iraq and Syria.The operations followed President Obamas decision last month to broaden the authority of American commanders to attack the Islamic States new branch in Afghanistan. The administration  which has been accused by Republicans of not having a strategy to defeat the group  is revamping plans for how it fights the terrorist organization in regions where it has developed affiliates.Many of these recent raids and strikes in Afghanistan have been in the Tora Bora region of Nangarhar Province  an inhospitable, mountainous area in the eastern part of the country, near the border with Pakistan. It was in Tora Bora that Osama bin Laden and other senior Qaeda militants took refuge during the American-led invasion in 2001, and eventually evaded capture by slipping into Pakistan.American commanders in Afghanistan said they believed that between 90 and 100 Islamic State militants had been killed in the recent operations. Intelligence officials estimate that there are roughly 1,000 Islamic State fighters in Nangarhar Province, and perhaps several thousand more elsewhere in the country. But even the generals leading the missions acknowledge that a resilient militant organization can recruit new fighters to replace those killed in American attacks.The new authority gives us the ability to take the gloves off to hold them in check, and we have been targeting them heavily and it has had quite an effect, said Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the militarys deputy chief of staff for operations in Afghanistan. But just because you take a bunch of guys off the battlefield doesnt mean you will stop this organization.Although Mr. Obama had declared an end to combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the operations are part of a continuing and potentially expanding American military footprint in south-central Asia, the Middle East and Africa for the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.In Iraq, the United States has about 3,700 troops, including trainers, advisers and commandos. There are several dozen Special Operations forces deployed in Syria. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has said the United States and its allies are looking to do more, and has asked other countries  including several Arab ones  to contribute more to the military campaign as it moves to reclaim Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, the two major cities controlled by the Islamic State.Administration officials are weighing a new campaign plan for Libya that would deepen the United States military and diplomatic involvement on yet another front against the Islamic State. The United States and its allies are increasing reconnaissance flights and intelligence collecting there  and even preparing for possible airstrikes and raids, according to senior American officials. Special Operations forces have met with various Libyan groups over the past months to vet them for possible action against the Islamic State.In Afghanistan, American and other allied commanders fear that the combination of fighters loyal to the Taliban, the Haqqani network and the Islamic State is proving too formidable for the still struggling Afghan security forces to combat on their own.The United States has 9,800 combat troops in Afghanistan. Although that figure is scheduled to decline to 5,500 by the time Mr. Obama leaves office next January, administration and military officials are privately hinting that the president may again slow the troop withdrawal later this year.At a hearing last week, Mr. Obamas nominee to be the next commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., was asked by Senator John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, if he believed that the overall security situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating, rather than improving.Sir, I agree with your assessment, said General Nicholson, a veteran of several deployments to Afghanistan. He said that the Taliban had fought against Afghan security forces more intensely than perhaps we anticipated and that the emergence of the Islamic State there had been unexpected.General Nicholson said that, if confirmed by the Senate, he would take his first 90 days to review the two primary missions in Afghanistan  counterterrorism and advising and assisting Afghan forces  before offering his recommendations on American troop levels in the country. The departing commander, Gen. John F. Campbell, is scheduled to testify before Congress this week, and he is expected to likewise underscore the rising threat from the Islamic State.Under newly relaxed rules the White House sent to the Pentagon last month, the military now needs to show only that a proposed target is related to Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan. Before, such a target could be struck only if it had significant ties to Al Qaeda.The military had been able to strike Islamic State targets in self-defense, but the new rules lower the standard for such offensive operations against the group.Suffice to say we had built up a sufficient amount of intel to be able to go after them in a robust way once we were able to take the gloves off, General Buchanan said.He added: We continue to conduct operations against Al Qaeda throughout, but have been more focused on ISIS in recent weeks.There are significant differences between the Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan and those in Iraq and Syria.In Afghanistan, a majority of the militants were previously part of the local Taliban or Haqqani network, and many of them have now rebranded themselves as members of the Islamic State. While the leaders of the group in Iraq and Syria are mostly from those countries, many of their fighters come from other Middle Eastern countries and from Europe.The Islamic State militants in Afghanistan receive some money from leaders in Iraq and Syria, but there is little evidence that they receive much direction about when and where to launch attacks, according to military officials. There have been few examples of the Islamic State members in Afghanistan being able to effectively communicate with each other to carry out complex attacks, like the ones often carried out in Iraq and Syria. Nevertheless, the group has claimed responsibility for several deadly bombings in Afghanistan in recent months.President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan has thanked American officials for their recent efforts against the Islamic State, which he fears is gaining strength, according to senior American officials.As the Islamic State has expanded in Afghanistan, it has also fought the Taliban as the two groups compete for influence and money.They are trying to assume control at the local level over checkpoints, over the drug trade, over flows of illicit goods, Brig. Gen. Wilson A. Shoffner, a spokesman for the American military in Afghanistan, said in a telephone interview on Sunday."}

My service included casualty notifications to parents and loved ones, grave site ceremonies, escorting the remains of a Marine killed by a roadside bomb to his family in Mauritius and leading counterinsurgency operations in Anbar Province in Iraq.I survived peacetime deployments to disaster-ridden countries ravaged by humanitarian disasters, and the assorted near-misses that go along with hard training involving live ammunition and military demolitions.I remain proud of my service, even more so because the Marine Corps afforded me the medical treatment I needed when I descended into a haze of alcohol addiction, hypervigilance and major depression. Extended dual-diagnosis treatment  four months in a facility, followed by intensive psychotherapy and a community support network that renewed me with a spirit of sobriety  enabled my wife and me to reclaim our marriage.I live as a sober man with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and I understand how it affects me  and only me. For me to meditate on Sarah Palins comments is a surefire path back to my own self-destruction. In any event, I took no offense. She is a mom, after all.KEITH F. KOPETSWashingtonTo the Editor:A blizzard swirled outside my window as I read Nate Betheas article. I felt a familiar urge to stay cocooned indoors. The danger I feared was not the storm outside but an inner threat that I battle daily. I am one of the civilians to whom Mr. Bethea refers: a woman who suffers the same PTSD symptoms as veterans and fears the same stigma.I received the diagnosis almost eight years ago. The attention given to PTSD among veterans at first made me feel like a fraud. How could my experience as a civilian compare to the trauma of combat? But because veterans stories were out in the world, I saw the similarities to my story: anxious days, sometimes weeks, of living on high alert, and at the other extreme, periods of apathy and emotional numbness.As Mr. Bethea points out, PTSD makes us prone toward self-hate. Hearing others stories taught me that I am not broken and that even I deserved help.Sharing my experience is critical in my recovery, but I still battle shame. But I accepted help because I recognized my feelings in the stories that others took the risk to tell.It is important to keep the conversation about PTSD going so that everyone  veterans and civilians alike  can speak and recover.NANCY MNDEZ-BOOTHJersey City"}
{"text": "BARCLAYS AND CREDIT SUISSE TO SETTLE DARK POOL INQUIRIES  |  Barclays and Credit Suisse will pay a combined $154.3 million to settle allegations that they misrepresented their private stock trading services,Liz Moyer reports in DealBook.The systems, known as dark pools, were supposed to offer a haven from predatory trading behavior.Barclays told clients that it monitored for high-speed trading activities in its dark pool, but did not. It also favored high-speed traders on the platform, so traditional traders found themselves facing the most aggressive and predatory high-speed traders, according to the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.An investigation also focused on Credit Suisses Crossfinder and Light Pool trading sites. The banks marketing materials said customers were supposed to be able to avoid trading with high-speed firms, which would be tagged as opportunistic traders. The system instead rated some high-speed firms as nonopportunistic and did not block others, as it said it would. Credit Suisse also did not keep track of participants in its dark pool as often as it said it did.Mr. Schneiderman said Credit Suisse made its dark pool a priority by sending it trade orders instead of sending them to other trading sites. It secretly allowed two high-speed trading firms to trade directly with its other customer orders through an undisclosed order matching platform and did not fully disclose that it transmitted confidential client information outside its dark pool, he said.Barclays will admit in the settlement that it misled customers and violated securities laws, the New York attorney generals office said. The bank is paying $70 million and has agreed to appoint an independent monitor for its electronic trading operations.Credit Suisse, which was not sued, is paying $60 million, as well as $24.3 million in disgorgement and interest to the Securities and Exchange Commission over trading violations.PUERTO RICO PROPOSES PLAN TO DELAY DEBT PAYMENTS  |  Puerto Rico proposed a broad debt exchange program on Friday that would slow down the payments it owes on its $72 billion debt,\nMary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook.\nThe terms, earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, called for the islands creditors to exchange securities that they now hold for one of two new classes of bonds, both of which would delay payments of principal and interest.

{"text": "REDMOND, Wash.  Taking a page from Jules Verne, researchers at Microsoft believe the future of data centers may be under the sea.Microsoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industrys most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill.Todays data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash.Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity.The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity.When I first heard about this I thought, Water ... electricity, why would you do that?  said Ben Cutler, a Microsoft computer designer who is one of the engineers who worked on the Project Natick system. But as you think more about it, it actually makes a lot of sense.Such a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage.The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the worlds population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users.For years, the main cloud providers have been seeking sites around the world not only for green energy but which also take advantage of the environment, said Larry Smarr, a physicist and scientific computing specialist who is director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego.Driven by technologies as varied as digital entertainment and the rapid arrival of the so-called Internet of Things, the demand for centralized computing has been growing exponentially. Microsoft manages more than 100 data centers around the globe and is adding more at a rapid clip. The company has spent more than $15 billion on a global data center system that now provides more than 200 online services.In 2014, engineers in a branch of Microsoft Research known as New Experiences and Technologies, or NExT, began thinking about a novel approach to sharply speed up the process of adding new power to so-called cloud computing systems.When you pull out your smartphone you think youre using this miraculous little computer, but actually youre using more than 100 computers out in this thing called the cloud, said Peter Lee, corporate vice president for Microsoft Research and the NExT organization. And then you multiply that by billions of people, and thats just a huge amount of computing work.The company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule  eight feet in diameter  that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected.The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night.The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsofts Azure cloud computing service.The research group has started designing an underwater system that will be three times as large. It will be built in collaboration with a yet-to-be-chosen developer of an ocean-based alternative-energy system. The Microsoft engineers said they expected a new trial to begin next year, possibly near Florida or in Northern Europe, where there are extensive ocean energy projects underway.The first prototype, affectionately named Leona Philpot  a character in Microsofts Halo video game series  has been returned, partly covered with barnacles, to the companys corporate campus here.It is a large white steel tube, covered with heat exchangers, with its ends sealed by metal plates and large bolts. Inside is a single data center computing rack that was bathed in pressurized nitrogen to efficiently remove heat from computing chips while the system was tested on the ocean floor.The idea for the underwater system came from a research paper written in 2014 by several Microsoft data center employees, including one with experience on a Navy submarine.Norman A. Whitaker, the managing director for special projects at Microsoft Research and a former deputy director of the Information Innovation Office at the Pentagons Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, said the underwater server concept was an example of what scientists at Darpa called refactoring, or completely rethinking the way something has traditionally been accomplished.Even if putting a big computing tube underwater seems far-fetched, the project could lead to other innovations, he said. For example, the new undersea capsules are designed to be left in place without maintenance for as long as five years. That means the servers inside it have to be hardy enough to last that long without needing repairs.That would be a stretch for most servers, but they will have to improve in order to operate in the underwater capsule  something the Microsoft engineers say they are working on.Theyre also rethinking the physical alignment of data centers. Right now, servers are put in racks so they can be maintained by humans. But when they do not need maintenance, many parts that are just there to aid human interaction can be removed, Mr. Whitaker said.The idea with refactoring is that it tickles a whole bunch of things at the same time, he said.In the first experiment, the Microsoft researchers said they studied the impact their computing containers might have on fragile underwater environments. They used acoustic sensors to determine if the spinning drives and fans inside the steel container could be heard in the surrounding water. What they found is that the clicking of the shrimp that swam next to the system drowned out any noise created by the container.One aspect of the project that has the most obvious potential is the harvest of electricity from the movement of seawater. This could mean that no new energy is added to the ocean and, as a result, there is no overall heating, the researchers asserted. In their early experiment the Microsoft engineers said they had measured an extremely small amount of local heating of the capsule.We measured no heating of the marine environment beyond a few inches from the vessel, Dr. Lee said."}
{"text": "On Monday, Iowans will become the first people in the nation to officially express their choices for the next president of the United States.But what interested me in particular was that a subset of those voters will be black. And since black voters in national polls are overwhelmingly Democratic and overwhelmingly prefer Hillary Clinton to her rivals, it seemed important to explore how these voters are processing this election cycle and its candidates.Over three days in Des Moines  from Friday to Sunday  I interviewed more than 30 black people, and spoke briefly to many more at a black church, a black-owned barbershop, a popular soul food restaurant and at African-American social events.My first impression from these conversations was that there existed a staggering level of ambivalence and absence of enthusiasm. A surprising number of people said that they were undecided and started an answer with the clause, If I had to choose Furthermore, there also seemed to be a generational divide between the people who felt more embraced and informed by the political campaigns  the older ones, and those who felt more abandoned or ignored by them  the younger ones.As Wayne Ford, co-founder and co-chairman of the Iowa Brown and Black Forum, told me Sunday, the level of excitement in the black community is nowhere near where it was 2008 when Barack Obama was a candidate.Also, the preference for Clinton over Bernie Sanders was a two-pronged assessment; it was a sophisticated weighing of comfort and of policy without an absolutism of good vs. bad, but rather a matter of degrees better or worse, more real or more fantasy.On the policy front, many simply found Sanderss policies unrealistically ambitious, an over-promising of giveaways. As one woman put it, He sounds like Oprah: You get a car! And you get a car! And you get a car! How is he going to pay for all that?Clintons ambitions seemed to be judged more realistic.Then, there was the problem of comfort.The Clintons seem to intuitively understand the value of retail politics, particularly when doing outreach to marginalized groups. I cant tell you how many stories Ive heard from black people about the time that one of the Clintons  most often Bill Clinton  spoke at or showed up at an event important to the black community.This means something. It adds to an aura of familiarity that doesnt extend to Sanders.For instance, on Saturday, the second and final day of the Ill Make Me a World in Iowa annual festival, billed as the largest African-American festival in the state, Hillary Clinton was the only candidate to make an appearance, albeit incredibly briefly.(Some may recognize the phrase Ill make me a world as a line in James Weldon Johnsons The Creation from his 1927 book of poems Gods Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse. Those who dont may already be at a deficit in African-American outreach.)This year for the first time a straw poll was taken at the event, and Clinton got more votes than all other candidates combined.But it seemed to me that the support was remarkably soft. People, in general, werent charging toward passion but slumping toward acquiescence.The next day, Bill Clinton strode into the Corinthian Baptist Church  accompanied by Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee. While Hillary had spoken for just a few minutes at the previous days event, Bill spoke so long at the church that there was no time left for a sermon.Bill Clinton seems to understand the powerful role the griot plays in black culture, and he channels that spirit when he speaks, far more than any non-black candidate Ive seen.Maybe that is why no one I spoke to mentioned how much damage the Clintons have done  the millions of families that were destroyed the last time they were in the White House thanks to their boastful embrace of the mass incarceration machine and their total capitulation to the right-wing narrative on race, crime, welfare and taxes, as Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, put it Thursday on her Facebook page.For Sanderss part, he seemed to be judged too unfamiliar and too absent, particularly down the homestretch. This feels to me like a terrible tactical error. No matter how much his positions and policies may benefit black voters, they are no more interested than any other group of voters in a long-distance love affair. You have to show up. You have to put in the time.It is true that in the last census, blacks were only 3.7 percent of the population in Iowa, but that vote matters, not only for Iowa but also as a harbinger for those who will come after.As Rick Wade, Obamas director of African-American outreach in 2008, told CNN last week, In both large and small caucuses, black voters can tilt the scales when the numbers are close. He continued: And strong black support in Iowa could affect black response and support in South Carolina and nationally."}
{"text": "Hollywood had a bumpy weekend. In its first three days of release, DreamWorks Animations high-stakes Kung Fu Panda 3 may have left money on the table at home in search of riches abroad. The Finest Hours, yet another ocean disaster movie, failed to attract an initial audience big enough to justify its cost. And tumbleweeds blew through theaters playing Jane Got a Gun, produced by and starring Natalie Portman.Kung Fu Panda 3 took in roughly $41 million at North American theaters, a sturdy result, especially for a sequel to a sequel. Even though the movie was No. 1 at the box office, that total marked a big decline for the series. Kung Fu Panda 2 collected about $50 million in initial ticket sales in 2011, after adjusting for inflation, and the original arrived to $66 million in 2008.One explanation: DreamWorks and its distribution partner, 20th Century Fox, chose an unusual January release date for the third installment  the other two arrived in the summer  to take advantage of a prime release window in China, where the New Year holiday is beginning. Kung Fu Panda 3, which cost at least $140 million to make and was co-produced by Oriental DreamWorks, took in $75 million in its initial release in five foreign markets, including China, the studios said.DreamWorks needs the film to be a global smash. The studio has been trying to regroup after a series of flops and sizable layoffs. Noting the absence of competition on the animated film front over the next month, Chris Aronson, Foxs president of domestic distribution, said he expected Kung Fu Panda 3 to have a very long and robust domestic theatrical run.The Revenant came in at No. 2 and Star Wars: The Force Awakens at No. 3.Among the other new wide releases in North America, The Finest Hours, which cost Walt Disney Studios about $80 million to make, only managed $10.3 million in ticket sales, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data. The movie, a rare release from Disney that does not rely on synergy with other parts of the companys entertainment empire, was most popular with older ticket buyers. Disney said on Sunday that 31 percent of the initial audience was 50 or older.Fifty Shades of Black (Open Road), a spoof that cost about $5 million to make, took in about $6.2 million. And Jane Got a Gun (the Weinstein Company), which suffered production difficulties and cost $25 million to make, collected $908,000."}
{"text": "Barclays and Credit Suisse will pay a combined $154.3 million to settle allegations that they misrepresented their private stock trading services.  The systems, known as dark pools, are supposed to offer a haven to traditional traders and investors from predatory trading behavior.The settlement was being completed on Sunday and was scheduled to be announced on Monday at a joint news conference by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Barclays, which is based in London, will admit in the settlement that it misled customers and violated securities laws, the New York attorney generals office said. The bank is paying $70 million and has agreed to appoint an independent monitor for its electronic trading operations. The bank said it was pleased to have reached an agreement.The S.E.C. will continue to shed light on dark pools to better protect investors, said Mary Jo White, the agencys chairwoman.Credit Suisse Securities, which was not sued, is paying $60 million. It is also paying $24.3 million in disgorgement and interest to the S.E.C. over other trading violations.We are pleased to have resolved these matters with the S.E.C. and the New York attorney general, Credit Suisse said.These cases mark the first major victory in the fight against fraud in dark pool trading that began when we first sued Barclays: coordinated and aggressive government action, admissions of wrongdoing, and meaningful reforms to protect investors from predatory, high-frequency traders, Mr. Schneiderman said. We will continue to take the fight to those who aim to rig the system and those who look the other way.Barclays and Credit Suisse are two of the largest operators of dark pools, which are private electronic trading sites where buyers and sellers are supposed to be able to make transactions without the interference of high-speed traders. Mr. Schneiderman sued Barclays in 2014, and said that rather than keeping high-speed traders out, its dark pool had actually welcomed them.The settlement will be the latest in Mr. Schneidermans efforts to clamp down on Wall Streets trading activities.The settlement also comes in the face of a fierce debate over the application of the electronic trading upstart Investors Exchange, which is trying to become an official stock exchange. IEX, as it is called, proposes to be an alternative to the established exchanges, which have policies that often favor high-speed traders over others, and one of its features is a speed bump that will slow down all traders. Its application, which has been pending for months at the S.E.C., has provoked dozens of comment letters.Barclays told clients of its dark pool, Barclays LX, that it monitored for high-speed trading activities on the site, but it did not. It also favored high-speed traders on the platform. As a result, traditional traders who thought they were trading only against other traditional traders were facing the most aggressive and predatory high-speed traders, Mr. Schneiderman said.The issues were brought to the attorney general by whistle-blowers inside Barclays.The investigation also focused on Credit Suisses Crossfinder and Light Pool trading sites, which are operated by Credit Suisse Advanced Execution Services. According to the banks marketing materials, customers were supposed to be able to avoid trading with high-speed firms, whose trading was considered opportunistic. The system was supposed to tag participants as opportunistic or non-opportunistic.Instead, Credit Suisses system rated some high-speed firms as non-opportunistic, and it did not block others, as it said it would. Credit Suisse also did not keep track of participants in its dark pool as often as it said it did.Mr. Schneiderman said Credit Suisse also made its dark pool a priority by sending it trade orders instead of sending them to other trading sites. It secretly allowed two high-speed trading firms to trade directly with its other customer orders through an undisclosed order matching platform. It did not fully disclose that it transmitted confidential client information outside its dark pool, he said."}
{"text": "The ghost light is on, planted at center stage, but if its job is to keep spirits away, it isnt working. In O, Earth, Casey Llewellyns whimsical, politically impassioned riff on Thornton Wilders Our Town, phantasms are present, and at least one of them is angry.The first ghost we meet, though, is Wilder (Martin Moran), a gentle soul who is digging his shovel into a hillside, looking for a time capsule.Social changes that have been reshaping American life since the early 20th century, the time Our Town depicts, are a particular concern of O, Earth, a play that demands we notice who still gets left out of our narratives.Presented by the Foundry Theater at Here, it gives us a Grovers Corners where the baseball-loving young George (Jess Barbagallo) is transgender and his sweetheart, Emily (Kristen Sieh), is a feminist. The Stage Manager (Donnetta Lavinia Grays) is a black woman who feels invisible as shes helping tell this story about these white people. And remember Simon Stimson (Mr. Moran), the towns alcoholic choirmaster? Gay and closeted, he drinks to drown his feelings of isolation.That sounds schematic, but Ms. Llewellyn and her director, Dustin Wills, have supplied O, Earth with plenty of silliness and surreality, making a sparkling, jagged mishmash of time and place that includes contemporary Greenwich Village and Los Angeles. When Emily alights on the West Coast, having left Grovers Corners behind, why would she not head straight for Ellen DeGeneres (Moe Angelos) and her wife, Portia de Rossi (Emily Davis)?Poignant and funny, O, Earth can be clumsy, too, though thats no fault of the fine cast. The play flattens badly into what feels like political show-and-tell in scenes involving the ghosts of Marsha P. Johnson (Julienne Brown, a.k.a. Mizz June) and Sylvia Rivera (Cecilia Gentili), early transgender activists in New York.Yet it is a meeting between these ghosts and Wilders that brings the play closest to naming what may have been the real Wilders enduring heartache. Surprised that the Stonewall riots didnt make it into Our Town, Marsha says of him, I thought he was part of the family. Shes a little muddled on chronology but sure the playwright was gay.The Wilder we meet is the shade of a man who was too frightened to talk of such things, who wrote a famous play about a town where none of the characters loved like him.O, Earth answers that fear with capacious sympathy and the certainty that sexuality  like race, like gender  should shut no ones experience out of the stories we tell."}

{"text": "Five years ago, Zach Cowie and Elijah Wood met at a party thrown by the Rodarte designers, Kate and Laura Mulleavy. Cowie was the D.J., Wood was a guest, and the two bonded over obscure music  or as Cowie put it, over a similar sense of adventure in our music consumption. Soon after, they formed Wooden Wisdom, spinning all-vinyl, danceable 70s psychedelic funk and garage mainly for their friends  and on occasion, at a venue near you.On a recent Friday evening, the Los Angeles-based duo was hanging out in the upstairs lounge of the San Francisco club Harlot. At midnight, they headlined a sold-out show. The first time I D.J.ed was in 2000, at a bar in New Zealand, Wood recalled. There was a CD mixer, and I played my music loud for people. They seemed to like it, and Ive been doing it ever since.Wood sticks to vinyl. Its aesthetically beautiful, its tactile, and theres something lovely about the format, he said. For a long time, there were certain things you could only find on vinyl, so theres a lot of discovery that happens in that world.A fan approached and asked to take a photo. Wood obliged graciously, with a recognizable movie-star rictus that appeared throughout the night, mostly for various strangers smartphones. This year, hell star alongside Nicolas Cage in a cop thriller, The Trust, while The Greasy Strangler, a horror comedy he produced, just premiered at Sundance. Does he care that people cant easily separate Elijah Wood, the actor, from Elijah Wood, the D.J.? We have associations with various people and the vocations theyre in, he said. Music has always been a huge part of my life, so its not new to me, but I get it. (His first acting break was in the 1989 music video for Paula Abduls Forever Your Girl, directed by David Fincher.)The reality is, this is something we would be doing anyway, Cowie said. The recent music supervisor for the Netflix series Master of None calls D.J.ing his professional hobby and finds it wild when some gigs become more high-profile than others. We dont make much of an effort, Wood said, laughing. They dont have a website, Wikipedia page or social media account, either.Later that night, Wooden Wisdom finally greeted the cheering crowd. Do us a favor  put your phones away, look at each other  and just dance! Cowie bellowed, as the first beat of David Bowies Magic Dance blasted through the speakers. The opening song was their way of paying tribute to the late legend, and, as it happens, another wearer of many hats. Below, they share a Valentines Day-inspired set of tunes  which, with the duos permission, weve put into a Spotify playlist, for the more modern listener."}
{"text": "In my latest Drink column, I discuss how prominently and evocatively the culture of drink features in the paintings of the Harlem Renaissance artist Archibald Motley. Drinking might get some serious thematic competition from music, except that the two so frequently go together in Motleys paintings, as in life.I found myself listening to Louis Armstrong a lot while I worked on the column, specifically the 2000 release The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings, produced and engineered by Phil Schaap.The last name might look familiar  even familial. Two or three times a year, when Im introduced to someone Ive never met, that person hears my last name and asks, Are you related to Phil Schaap? Few questions delight me more. Yes I am, I get to answer, nearly bursting with pride. Hes my first cousin, once removed.Phil is the host of WKCRs Bird Flight, a five-mornings-a-week consideration of the music of Charlie Parker, and the curator of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York. Hes known for his encyclopedic knowledge of the music form and his exacting attention to details. There is no exaggerating the relentlessness of Schaaps approach, David Remnick wrote in a 2008 New Yorker profile. I dont think its an exaggeration, either, to say that cousin Phil probably knows more about jazz than anybody in the world.So when I decided my latest column should have a playlist composed of jazz tunes that Archibald Motley himself might have listened to, I asked my cousin to help me out. I told Phil that Motley was born in New Orleans, raised in Chicago and lived briefly in Paris. I said that the paintings that interested me most were from the years 1926 to 1945. And I couldnt help mentioning that, yes, theres a lot of drinking going on. With only these pieces of information, Phil devised this six-song playlist, with notes:Stock Yards Strut (1926), Freddie Keppard and His Jazz Cardinals.Done in Chicago by New Orleanian Freddie Keppard in his only leader date. Keppard was the hot-jazz trumpeter in the Creole Band, which brought jazz to the full U.S.A. when featured in vaudeville 1914 to 1917, Phil says, adding: Keppard drank a lot!Louisianna (1928), Bix Beiderbecke and His Gang.Of this, Phil remarks succinctly: Bix drank a lot! (Id add that anyone who knows the sad, short story of the genius cornetists life and death might say thats an understatement.)Fifteen Cents (1933), Frankie Half Pint Jaxon.Another piece done in Chicago, Phil notes that its about getting some prohibition booze.Honeysuckle Rose (1937), Coleman Hawkins All-Star Jam Band.This piece was recorded in Paris. Phil notes that it was the first title on the first session for Swing Records  the first all-jazz record company, and it was a breakthrough in showcasing the reed section. It is a most masterful arrangement by Benny Carter.Goin to Chicago (1941), Count Basie Orchestra.This song, Phil says, would become a signature piece for Joe Williams singing with the Count Basie Band  New Testament edition  during the 1950s and 1960s. But this April 10, 1941, recording was the hit single, done by the original Count Basie Orchestra and featuring the singing of Mr. Five by Five, Jimmy Rushing. This one was actually recorded in Chicago!Perdido Street Blues (1940), Louis Armstrong With Sidney Bechet.Armstrong, of course, had to make an appearance on the list. The title, Phil notes, makes reference to a once-famous block in the Crescent City, the city where Armstrong, Bechet  and Motley  were born."}

{"text": "In the winter of 2008, Iowa felt like the center of something big. I lived in Iowa City then, and I voted in the January caucus that turned out to be Barack Obamas first step to victory. That night and throughout the campaign, the city seemed to buzz with emotion  with hope, yes, but also with joy. There was dancing in the streets of Iowa City the night Mr. Obama won the general election, and Ive never seen such collective rejoicing before or since.This years caucus offers candidates who are historic in their own ways  Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Hillary Clinton, a potential first female president. I went back to Iowa City on Sunday to see if either was lighting up the town the way Mr. Obama did.About 70,000 people live in Iowa City; around 30,000 of those attend the University of Iowa, where I was a graduate student in 2008. The town is fairly liberal  Johnson County, where its located, went for Mr. Obama by large margins in 2008 and 2012  but it has an active Republican presence too. Its not necessarily representative of the state as a whole, nor do the people I talked to represent all the views in town, but what I saw gave me a sense of how well this years candidates are replicating the past.Mr. Sanders has a significant lead among young Iowans, and most of the students I talked to felt he inspired the most enthusiasm on campus. Bernies more consistent in his views, said Jolene Tigges, a University of Iowa student. Hillary kind of just goes where the vote does.Id say most of campus is Bernie, she said. Asked to sum up the Sanders campaign in one word, she called it revolutionary.Most undergraduates today were children during the 2008 campaign. But some longtime Iowa City residents see a similar spirit this time around. The first Obama campaign was pretty exciting, and I feel like this one has that same sort of excitement going on, said Meg Ives, an employee at the Hamburg Inn #2, a diner and popular campaign stop. I think a lot of it has to do with Bernie. The restaurant ran out of burgers on Saturday night, she said, mobbed after a Sanders rally the campaign says drew nearly 5,000 people.Even some of Mrs. Clintons supporters acknowledge she doesnt quite inspire the same enthusiasm. Gary Russell, an Iowa City resident, said after a Clinton rally at the Sheraton Hotel that he plans to caucus for Mrs. Clinton. But when I asked if there was any way she could capture the excitement Iowans felt for Mr. Obama in 2008, he answered flatly, No.Obama has this charisma, and Sanders in a strange way has got charisma too. But he believes Mr. Sanders would have trouble getting things passed.Many supporters of Mrs. Clinton cast her as the candidate best able to build on Mr. Obamas record. I like the progress that President Obama has made, said Trent Seubert, a University of Iowa student and volunteer for the Clinton campaign. I just want more of it to happen. He likes Mr. Sanderss ideas, but worries he wont be able to realize them.I dont want us to get him elected and then have all the stuff that he plans to do not get through, and see how disheartening that would be towards our generation, he said.I met Clinton supporters on Sunday who are deeply excited about their candidate  Ive just been a fan of Hillary Clinton from the beginning, said Sehseh Sanan, a University of Iowa student and Clinton campaign volunteer. And I also met Sanders supporters who believe he will expand on what President Obama has begun.But in many ways, the Obama legacy seems split in two, with Mr. Sanders as heir to some of the spirit of 2008 and Mrs. Clinton pitching herself as the one who can most effectively continue Mr. Obamas work.Sometimes in my heart I like Bernie, and my head tells me Hillary, said Mike Crawford, a Sanders supporter who attended the Clinton rally.The challenge for whoever wins the nomination will be uniting the two."}

{"text": "It was a space problem of sorts for the new British prime minister: where to put the minuscule sample of the lunar dust that Americas Apollo 11 astronauts had scooped from the surface of the moon in their giant leap for mankind?The answer was a cupboard in the prime ministers residence at 10 Downing Street, where the four moon specks, a gift to Britain from the United States, languished for several years in the 1970s.The moon dusts fate was revealed recently by the British National Archives, which released 178 pages of correspondence on the subject from the prime ministers office dating back 30 years.Of the 48 pounds of rocks that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin lugged back to Earth in August 1969, mostly for scientific analysis, plaques with four pieces weighing 50 milligrams, just over two-thousandths of an ounce, were conferred by the White House as good-will gifts on each of the leaders of 135 countries, the United Nations and all 50 states.President Richard M. Nixon presented Prime Minister Harold Wilson with the moon memento in Washington in January 1970: four tiny pebbles, the size of rice grains, mounted on an artless, 9-by-11-inch commemorative wooden plaque.The display is unlikely to win any design awards. Still, nearly a half-century ago when space travel was largely the stuff of science fiction, the extraterrestrial souvenir was in great demand by museums across Britain.Mr. Wilson wanted the display to remain at 10 Downing Street in perpetuity, but agreed to lend it first to the Science Museum in London and then to regional museums around Britain.It returned to No. 10 in 1973.Mr. Wilsons successor, Edward Heath, also wanted the display to remain at Downing Street, but where?I dont much like the idea of it being in one of the public rooms, he said.Out of sight, apparently, was not out of mind, and after Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, the question of what to do with the Nixon gift intruded on the affairs of state once again.Unfortunately, Mr. Heath was unable to identify a sufficiently public spot in No. 10 aesthetically suitable for locating a contemporary-style display stand containing moon rock samples, an aide advised Mrs. Thatcher. Then the aide revealed an embarrassing truth.I have now unearthed this exhibit from the cupboard in which it has languished for several years, the aide wrote.Perhaps the Science Museum would want it back as a semi-permanent loan? Once was enough, said Dame Margaret Weston, the museums director, back when a lunar landing was a novelty.According to an adviser to the prime minister, As a curiosity (ranking with a toothbrush once used by Napoleon which they have at the museum) they would always be very willing to give it a home if we no longer wanted the exhibit at No. 10, but more significant specimens of moon rock are apparently available from NASA if required as part of a scientific display.Last week, John Pryor, a spokesman for No. 10, said that the display was and has for some time been in an anteroom accessible to visitors and guests near the first-floor study (where Mrs. Thatcher used to work and where Winston Churchill slept).Despite its stay in the Downing Street cupboard, Britain was grateful for the gift, said Sir Anthony Seldon, No. 10s official historian and the vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham.It is doubly interesting, both because of its scientific importance as an exhibit bringing part of an alien land mass into the most historic building in the world, he said, and as an indicator of the relationship between Nixon and Wilson, which was at a postwar low point of the special relationship between Britain and the United States.Journalists will make of the story what they will, but the truth is that it was a genuinely valuable gift by President Nixon of something of colossal scientific and historic interest, especially compared to most gifts the P.M. is given, he said. The problems arise, Mr. Seldon said, just from lack of space.But even as the display was being rotated among other museums in the early 1970s, the Science Museum was lowering expectations.The specimens were so small they were magnified under a golf-ball size plastic hemisphere and the museum noted in a memo that some viewers thought they looked like tea leaves or coal.So, in order to counteract bathos, a memo from the Science Museum said, photos and rocket models should be included with the display in order to relate the unimpressive-looking particles to the remarkable human and technological feat of the moon landing.The prime ministers office also assessed the risks of sending the display to the Ulster Museum where a Union Jack that had traveled to the moon would provide rather a good object for some demonstration of force by dissident movements and where its theft or damage would undoubtedly attract disproportionate attention.The Home Office concluded that it would be reasonably safe.In fact, the British lunar keepsake endured longer than the moon rocks that President Nixon gave the Republic of Ireland. They were on display in the Dunsink Observatory in Dublin, when a fire broke out in 1977. The debris, including the display, was accidentally discarded in a local landfill."}
{"text": "MELBOURNE, Australia   Novak Djokovic was trying to explain to the television studio hosts how he had managed to tie two Australian legends with his 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 (3) victory over Andy Murray in the Australian Open final Sunday. But he could not hear himself think.Below the makeshift broadcasting studios on the Melbourne Park grounds, a large group of fellow Serbs had broken into song.Theyre saying, We love you, in Serbian, Djokovic said sheepishly.For one piquant mix of people in this countrys melting pot, Australia Day last Tuesday was not the only time during the tournament set aside for nationalistic revelry. Sunday, with the mens final, became Serbia Day for fans of Djokovic, who tied the Australian Roy Emerson with his sixth title here. It was his 11th major singles championship over all, equaling the career total of another Australian great, Rod Laver, as well as Bjorn Borg.Djokovic, 28, carried into the match a stuffed toy wombat named Fatso, a good-luck token he borrows every year from a volunteer driver who ferried him to and from the tennis grounds during his first title run, in 2008.His fans went bearing, and in some cases wearing, their own lucky charms. Some came in water polo caps in the red, blue and white colors of Serbia in a nod to the countrys world championship team, which Djokovic cheered on his social media accounts during its march to the title in August.Other fans wore red, blue and white bandannas tied around their heads; draped the Serbian flag across their shoulders like capes; or covered their necks with Serbian soccer scarves. One man wore a white sweat jacket with three silk-screened images of Djokovic on the back.Many arrived four and a half hours before the first point of the final so that they could line up to have their faces painted. Popular choices were the Serbian flag or Go Nole, in reference to Djokovics nickname.Sandra Vukovic, a resident of Brisbane, Australia, of Serbian ancestry, said she had waited 25 minutes to have red, blue and white stripes applied ear to ear, with a white eagle  like the one in the coat of arms on Serbias flag  painted around her eye.Several hundred Serbian fans paid 35 Australian dollars (about $25) each for a grounds pass and planted themselves in front of the video screen on a spacious garden square that has effectively become Novaks Neighborhood over the last nine years.The square is set up like a pedestrian version of a drive-in theater, with double chaise longues and straight-back chairs all pointed toward the screen and available first come first served. By 4 p.m., three and a half hours before Djokovic and Murray walked onto the court, all the seats were taken.Vukovic, who said she had bought a grounds pass because she could not afford a ticket to the final, which would have cost hundreds of dollars, has been attending the tournament for nearly a decade. She comes, she said, to cheer for Djokovic, whose humility she finds irresistible.Djokovic explained the reason for his modesty in his postmatch news conference. Asked if his victories over Murray, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal this year were proof that he had separated himself from his competitors, Djokovic said he did not think that way because then you can get a big slap from karma.While Djokovic was the main draw, he was not the only attraction for the Serbs who spilled over the grass and onto the pavement, where they sat cross-legged, necks craned at the screen.Its become like a tradition, said Vukovic, who has built friendships with many of the other regulars. With a sweep of her hand, she indicated a group seated at a picnic table behind her and said, I met these people one year at the tournament.Vukovic held in her lap a glossy photograph of Djokovic with the words: I cant keep calm. Im a Nole fan.For Vukovic  unlike Djokovic, who won his Australian Open tuneup in Doha, Qatar  2016 did not start auspiciously. She lost her job. But I think Novaks my lucky charm, she said. I got a new job that Ill be starting when I get back to Brisbane.For Australias sizable Serbian population, the final day of the mens tournament has become an annual chance to pay homage to a sporting hero.Noles like a god in Serbia, said Tom Dimitrijevic, who was on break from his job supervising the tram service operating outside the tennis grounds.I was in Serbia during last years French Open, Dimitrijevic said, referring to the years second major, in which Djokovic lost to Stan Wawrinka in four sets in the final. After he lost to Wawrinka, it was like a week of mourning. People were so dejected in the streets.I dont think Australians understand. This is a prosperous country. But in Serbia, its not like its in an economic boom. Nole is No. 1 in the world, so it gives the country something to be happy about.On Sunday, several police officers patrolled the periphery of the grass square. Over the years, skirmishes have broken out between fans from Serbia and those from Bosnia and Herzegovina or Croatia. Plastic chairs, bottles and punches have been thrown on occasion, but on this night all was calm  except when a Djokovic winner caused the crowd to break out in chants.During the second set, a man with a Serbia bandanna around his head and a Serbian flag around his shoulders returned from a concession stand with four cups of beer in a drink holder. He delivered the drinks to his friends, who were leaning against a tree, their eyes fixed on the big screen. Someone started a chant of Lets go, Nole, and it rippled through the crowd like a wave.On the big screen, the analysts from Seven Network of Australia remarked on how quiet the crowd was inside Rod Laver Arena.The crowd outside the arena grew more boisterous as Djokovic made his way from one television interview to another. They serenaded him in Serbian, singing, We love you. After Djokovic finished his last interview, he turned around, waved, gave a thumbs-up sign and threw four sneakers, one by one, into the rippling sea of red, blue and white.They waited for me, Djokovic said. Im very grateful for their support. Its quite incredible. I dont take it for granted, obviously. Ive had the fortune to win this trophy now for six times, but I never experienced such support after a match.He added, Its amazing."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM  A Palestinian policeman shot three Israeli soldiers, seriously wounding two, at a West Bank checkpoint on Sunday before being killed by soldiers, the Israeli military said.The Palestinian, Amjad Sukari, also known as Amjad Abu Amar, 34, had worked as a bodyguard and driver for the Palestinian attorney general. Just hours before the attack, at a checkpoint near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, he posted on Facebook that there is nothing worth living for on this earth as long as the occupation oppresses our souls and kills our brothers and sisters. He added: Everyday someone dies, I may be the next.He drove up to the checkpoint and emerged firing a weapon, the military said.The attack was unusual because it involved a Palestinian official and a firearm, reported to be a handgun. Most of the attacks on Israelis and Israeli soldiers in the last four months have been with knives, and many have been carried out by young people under 25 years of age. Ynet, a leading Israeli news site, reported that a friend of Mr. Sukari said that he had been anxious about his debts.The Palestinian Authority and Fatah, the party led by President Mahmoud Abbas, have not endorsed this wave of attacks except to honor the dead as martyrs to the cause of Palestine. Hamas, the movement that controls Gaza, praised Sundays attack.There was another similar attack in early December by a Palestinian Authority intelligence officer, Mazen Hassan Areiba, 37, who shot and wounded two Israelis near the Hizme checkpoint to Jerusalem before being killed. A married father of four, he was a relative of Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and chief negotiator for the Palestinians.Later Sunday, the military said a Palestinian attempted to ram his vehicle into soldiers north of Jerusalem. It said troops opened fire, wounding the man, who was taken to the hospital for treatment. On Saturday evening, a 17-year-old Israeli, a recent immigrant from the United States, was lightly wounded in a stabbing attack at Damascus Gate in Jerusalem. The police said they had arrested two suspects, both 15 years old.In the last four months, at least 26 Israelis have been killed and more than 155 Palestinians, most of them assailants, the Israeli authorities said."}

{"text": "Last fall, Mike Valde attended a Ted Cruz speech, where the Texas senator delivered his standard presidential promise to repeal President Obamas signature health care law.As he sat in the audience, Mr. Valde, 63, of Coralville, Iowa, thought of his brother-in-law, Mark Gaffney, who had recently died but had also used the law to buy insurance. Mr. Valde said he had begun to wonder how Mr. Cruz would replace the Affordable Care Act  and how it would impact people like Mr. Gaffney.After I saw him there, I didnt say a word. I wished I had asked him something, Mr. Valde, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, recalled in a phone interview Sunday. Why didnt I speak up and say, How do you take care of the Mark Gaffneys of the world?So, on Saturday, Mr. Valde got his chance  and took it  during an intense exchange with Mr. Cruz in a middle school cafeteria in Hubbard, Iowa. Mr. Valde described how Mr. Gaffney, a barber in Arizona, worked for himself and never had a paid vacation day, and used the health care law, at last, to buy insurance. He began feeling ill and went to a doctor, and soon learned he had terminal cancer, Mr. Valde told Mr. Cruz. The room went silent.Mark never had health care until Obamacare, Mr. Valde told Mr. Cruz, What are you going to replace it with?Mr. Cruz, during a back-and-forth, expressed condolences, while also deriding the law as a job-killer that has made insurance premiums skyrocket.The exchange became a highly discussed moment on the campaign trail during the final days before the Iowa caucuses. Later Saturday, Mrs. Clinton mentioned it during a rally at a high school, criticizing how Mr. Cruz does not offer an alternative to the health care law.Mr. Valde and his wife, Jill, Mr. Gaffneys sister, attended a Bill Clinton rally on Sunday and chatted with Mr. Clinton in the rope line, with the former president telling them that he had heard about the question posed to Mr. Cruz.The Valdes said they were surprised by the attention, with word of the exchange getting back to Mr. Gaffneys friends hundreds of miles away.  When Marks friends saw it in Arizona, they said, Thanks for bringing it up, Mrs. Valde said.Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to repeal the health care law, which they see as an expensive government program, but President Obama has vetoed their attempts. The law is unpopular in public opinion polls, and Mr. Cruz and virtually all the other Republican candidates have vowed to get rid of it if elected.Mr. and Mrs. Valde said in the interview that before the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Gaffney had been either uninsured or lightly insured, making it prohibitively expensive for him to see doctors.He was having financial problems and the last thing he could do was pay to take care of himself, Mrs. Valde said. Hed say: Its just too expensive. I cant afford to go.When coverage under the health care law went into effect in 2014, Mrs. Valde said, she suggested to her brother that he should sign up, and he eventually did, though she did not know precisely when.It was last spring when they visited him that they noticed that he appeared unwell, and they encouraged him to see a doctor. By summer, he told them that he had terminal cancer, and he died on Aug. 16 at age 58.The Valdes said that they did not believe that earlier access to the health insurance necessarily would have saved Mr. Gaffneys life, but that his plight convinced them that the access to coverage he ultimately obtained would be important for others. They were grateful, they said, that Mr. Gaffney was eventually able to see a doctor.What about people like him? Mr. Valde said. People could be saved.He added, There are a lot of Mark Gaffneys out there."}
{"text": "BUENOS AIRES   For more than two decades, an investigation into the suicide bombing of a Jewish center here in 1994 that killed 85 people has faced setbacks and controversy. It caused an intractable rift between Argentina and Iran. A former president has been put on trial, accused of orchestrating a cover-up. And a prosecutor involved in the case died last year in murky circumstances.But now, Argentinas new government is pledging to finally get to the bottom of a case that cost the country about $3.5 million last year alone, and that took on a life of its own, swallowing up many who touched it.President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December, has revamped the government department assigned to the bombing investigation and has vowed to introduce legislation that would allow for the trial of suspects in absentia.The question is whether those efforts, which face considerable legal hurdles and political opposition, will translate into lasting results in the long-running case.The president wants to re-establish the commitment of the Argentine state to solving the attack, said Mario Cimadevilla, who has been appointed to head the investigative department.The unit was created in 2000 to lend support from the executive branch to prosecutors leading the inquiry, for instance by collating evidence from government agencies. In recent years, it had largely been sidelined.Mr. Cimadevilla has new powers that include the ability to propose legislation and furnish information to investigators working on the death last year of Alberto Nisman, the prosecutor overseeing the case, which may shed new light on the bombing. In 2006, Mr. Nisman blamed the bombing on the Iranian government.Mr. Cimadevillas first task has been drafting a bill to try defendants in absentia, which the government expects to send to Congress when it reconvenes in March. If approved, it would allow suspects abroad who refuse to cooperate with the bombing investigation to be tried in Argentinas courts.We dont want trials to be halted because the defendant isnt there, Mr. Cimadevilla said. That is denying justice.Mr. Macris opponents have accused him of trying to score political points by seeking to close the case with the swift convictions of eight former officials in Iran whom Mr. Nisman suspected of masterminding the bombing.Sergio Burstein, whose estranged wife died in the attack, said the government was acting prematurely by drafting the bill when the prosecutors who replaced Mr. Nisman seem far from concluding their investigation and are still trying to glean evidence from a trial involving a former president, Carlos Sal Menem. Mr. Menem is accused of conspiring to conceal a possible Syrian connection to the bombing.Alejandro Ra, a lawyer for Active Memory, a group of victims relatives, said Mr. Macris administration wanted a verdict. We dont want a verdict, Mr. Ra said. We want the truth, and to get to it you have to investigate.Others say Mr. Macris efforts are designed to endear him to Jewish leaders with whom his party is perceived as having close ties.The chief Jewish umbrella organization here, known by its acronym, DAIA, supports the idea of a trial in absentia. It presented a similar bill in 2014, and Mr. Cimadevilla said the governments proposal would draw on that document.There needs to be a close to the case; if not, the dead are never going to rest in peace, Ariel Cohen Sabban, the president of DAIA, said at a recent gathering in a plaza here to commemorate a year since Mr. Nismans death.Mr. Macri does not have a majority in Congress, so he will need to negotiate with lawmakers from other blocs to pass the legislation. He could get some cross-party support, but it is unclear how much political capital he will want to invest in the bill when he is also trying to push through other important measures, said Juan Cruz Daz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm.Mr. Nisman, the lead prosecutor on the investigation from 2005 until his mysterious death a year ago from a gunshot to the head, accused the former Iranian officials of authorizing the bombing of the Jewish center and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement, of executing it.Other unproven theories point to Syrian involvement or a so-called local connection, which once involved a former chief of Argentinas intelligence agency and a group of police officers. These suspects were among 22 people acquitted in 2004, but the ex-intelligence chief, Hugo Alfredo Anzorreguy, is back in court together with Mr. Menem. (At least one fact has been established: Carlos Alberto Telleldn, an Argentine car salesman, was the last known registered owner of the Renault van that was loaded with explosives and driven into the Jewish center headquarters.)Former President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner signed a contentious bilateral pact with Iran in 2013 so a jointly appointed commission could interrogate the Iranian suspects in Tehran. It was unclear how any subsequent trial would have proceeded.Mrs. Kirchner said the agreement was the only way of enticing Iran to collaborate in the investigation. But Jewish leaders here, some victims relatives and the political opposition criticized the arrangement, saying it would be too easy for the Iranians to absolve themselves of a crime committed in Argentina if the investigation was shifted to their own country.The pact was approved by lawmakers, but it was declared unconstitutional in 2014 by a two-judge panel that ruled it was an overreach of the executive branch into a judicial investigation. The new government recently dropped an appeal by Mrs. Kirchners administration of that ruling.Even if passed, a bill allowing trials in absentia would  like the pact with Iran  face challenges in the courts, experts say. Trials in absentia are not explicitly addressed in Argentinas Constitution, but they would violate its provisions for due process, said Ral Gustavo Ferreyra, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Buenos Aires.However, when the two-judge panel ruled against the pact with Iran, one of them highlighted how the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights once approved the extradition of a defendant from Costa Rica after he was convicted in absentia in France; he was given the right to appeal and a new trial. The Constitution has a provision to incorporate this type of international precedent.If you guarantee there can be a full review of the ruling, that would give it constitutional validity, said Francisco Castex, a professor of criminal law here.Even if trials eventually proceed, experts note that it is unlikely Iran would turn over citizens convicted in the case.Its inconsequential, Carlos Escud, an Argentine political scientist who has written about the bombing investigation, said of the bill. Its as if the government is saying, The show must go on. But the Iranians would never give themselves up."}
{"text": "Not that long ago, most American readers had never heard of Stefan Zweig, even though he was one of Europes most popular authors  every bit as famous as Thomas Mann, certainly  at the sunny peak of his career.Over the last few years, however, several publishing houses have begun to reissue Zweigs works  in slow bursts at first, and then in a fusillade, so that American audiences might delight in the short stories, novellas, biographies, essays and powerful novel, Beware of Pity, that brought Zweig so much glamour and recognition between the first and second World Wars.Then the writer George Prochnik wrote a nuanced biography of Zweig, The Impossible Exile, in 2014, and Wes Anderson made The Grand Budapest Hotel, in which no less than three characters were modeled after the author in some way.With Ostend: Stefan Zweig, Joseph Roth, and the Summer Before the Dark, Volker Weidermann has expanded the nimbus of Zweigs mystique to include the cohort of exiles who surrounded the author in the summer of 1936, when he took refuge in the Belgian resort town of Ostend.The son of a prosperous textile manufacturer, Zweig was the elegant embodiment of the assimilated Jew  urbane, instinctually tolerant, inclined toward pacifism. When he first arrives at the beach, he is a man in crisis: reeling from the incursions of his beloved Austria into the sanctuary of his home (the police raided his mansion in Salzburg), denuded of his German readership (Jews are no longer welcome in print), estranged from his wife (he has fallen in love with his secretary, Lotte Altmann).The universe, literature, politics  wouldnt it be wonderful never to have to think about them again? Where would be the farthest place from it all? Weidermann writes. A beach in Belgium, white house, sun, a broad promenade, little bistros looking out over the water. He wants Ostend. With Lotte. He brings her along.Zweigs friend the writer Joseph Roth descends from scrappier stock. Hes a poor Eastern Jew from the far frontier of the monarchy  bitter, bilious, the king of grumps, the king of curses and the king of all hates. From Amsterdam, he, too, joins Zweig on the beach, but only thanks to Zweigs largess and patient indulgence: Roth is a penniless drunk and alcoholic of such spectacular devotion that he spends every morning throwing up, sometimes for hours. He eats almost nothing.In The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743-1933, Amos Elon argues that one of the greatest unrequited love stories may be that of the Jews with Germany. Before Hitler rose to power, other Europeans often feared, admired, envied and ridiculed the Germans, he writes. Only Jews seemed actually to have loved them.The same might readily be said of many Jews in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and this pining for returned affection  all while its opposite, a genocidal hatred, is aborning back home  forms the emotional core of Mr. Weidermanns book. The men and women in Zweigs circle badly yearn for their native countries; away from home, they feel lost in their own skins. Five will eventually kill themselves, Zweig and Lotte included. There are some souls who survive deracination. But others shrivel at the roots.On the day I lost my passport, Zweig wrote in his memoir, The World of Yesterday, published in 1942, I discovered, at the age of 58, that losing ones native land implies more than parting with a circumscribed area of soil. It was in 1942 that Zweig also took his life, in Brazil.Yet Ostend, as a work of nonfiction, is not grim. If anything, its the opposite  light on its feet, a reverie in a way; when its over, youll half wonder if youve dreamed it. Mr. Weidermann, who covers literature for Der Spiegel, draws from the same source materials that any traditional history would (diaries, correspondence, autobiographies), but he writes the book as a novel, almost, recreating scenes and channeling characters thoughts:Roths relief comes flooding back by the minute, he writes of the authors first encounter with Zweig at the Ostend train station. A man, a friend who organizes things for him, his connection to the sun, to common sense, to the guarantee of a safe existence. How gladly he will entrust himself to him this summer. How confident his step becomes immediately.I enjoyed getting lost in the books melodies, but I also found its airiness dissatisfying in places; I longed for sharp analysis where there was only atmosphere. The first few chapters and subtitle both suggest that the book will be about the friendship between Zweig and Roth, as complicated a relationship as one might imagine (Zweig has the money and fame; Roth, the greater talent). But their story fades from view until the end of the book.In the middle, readers are served a series of vignettes about migrs in Roth and Zweigs orbit  banned writers and Communists primarily, most of them Jewish but some not. They gossip, compete and hold forth about their passions at Caf Flore, their bistro of choice. But their discussions, no matter how lively, are always tinged with fear. The impending Olympic Games in Berlin particularly fills them with dread. The Nazi propaganda machine is at full tilt, papering over its crimes, its hate.Der Strmer has been censored for weeks, says Ernst Toller, the exiled German playwright. Not to remove any statements, just the anti-Semitic passages.Wonderful! says Roth. So now theyre selling blank paper!Their only salvation can be found in writing. Its their sole form of agency, their one means to will themselves into existence while their works are being burned and destroyed at home. In a letter, Irmgard Keun, Roths lover, says that she and Roth engage every day in the purest literary Olympics, working at opposite ends of a cafe and counting who has written the most pages by days end. Zweig does some of the best work of his career. Roth helps him.And what is Zweigs story about? The lost menorah of the Temple of Solomon. It will become in some small way their shared book, Weidermann writes, the story of eternal flight and of the belief that there is a place, which will hold its secret forever, where the Jews of the world will be able to live in peace."}
{"text": "In his latest feature, Chi-Raq, Spike Lee tells the story of the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago through the eyes of a gangsters girlfriend, who persuades women to withhold sex until their menfolk disavow firearms. During production last summer, the film made headlines when the citys mayor, Rahm Emanuel, criticized the title, which borrowed a nickname Chicagoans had coined for their towns violent turn.Chi-Raq, which was released last week on DVD and will stream on Amazon Prime beginning Thursday, has met with largely positive reviews, with Manohla Dargis of The New York Times saying it entertains, engages and, at times, enrages as it takes on violence and other topics.Mr. Lee, thoughtful, chatty and intense, met to talk at his office at New York University, where he is a professor, the day the Oscar nominations came out, and spoke about the film, gun violence and how movie awards wont change Hollywoods homogeneity. A little over a week later, he would announce that he would not be attending the Oscar ceremony on Feb. 28 because all of the acting nominees were, for the second consecutive year, white. Here are excerpts from the conversation:Q. What did you think about President Obamas efforts to take on gun violence?A. I was very encouraged by the presidents speech on gun violence. Gun manufacturers and a lot of politicians twist his words, and have a large number of Americans somehow believing that what hes saying is hes taking away their guns, and Second Amendment right. And hes not saying that at all. Ninety Americans die every day due to gun violence, two-thirds of them due to suicide. If you can reduce that number, its a wonderful thing. During the preproduction for Chi-Raq, I got to meet many parents who told me themselves that today, theyre not who they were before their children got murdered.Q. Were you surprised Rahm Emanuel spoke out against Chi-Raq?A. Ive never heard him say anything about the film once the movie came out. Mayor Rahm Emanuel never said, You cant make this film. He wanted me to change the title because he felt two things: it was going to hurt tourism and it was going to hurt economic development. But what tourism did Chi-Raq hurt on the South Side? What economic development does Chi-Raq hurt on the South Side?Theres two Chicagos. Also Spike Lee  Im going to speak like one of those football players, speak in the third person  Spike Lee did not come up with Chi-Raq.We started filming June 1 and we finished July 9. During that time, I think there was 331 who had been wounded and shot and 55 murdered.Q. In your movie there is the wish that people give up guns. It has been done in Australia and with the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. But it took a lot. What would it take in America, barring a sex strike?A. Obama said hes not supporting any candidate whos running for office, whether they be Republican, Democrat or independent, who is pro-N.R.A. There has to be some common ground. Why do we not have a law in place now that says that if youre on the no-fly list you cant buy a gun in this country?Q. There seems to be no common ground right now. Every time Obama talks about guns, sales spike.A. Or theres a mass shooting. After San Bernardino, they went up.Its called scare tactics. I dont think anything good comes out of people using fear, whether it be Mussolini or Hitler.Trump too. Whats his motto? Make America great again? Those are code words. Its like, all right, lets put the blacks back in their place where they used to be. You know what, why not go all the way? Lets bomb churches, lets bring back Bull Connor, lets have water cannons, lets have German shepherds. You might as well. They want to rewind the clock. Its not just black folks; women too. Lets rewind when white men were in control.Q. Lets talk about where white men are definitively in control, in Hollywood. You said your plan was to get in and to pull in as many black people as you could. I dont know if you saw the Directors Guild of Americas list of minority directors hired each year, but its so low its almost shocking. What will it take?A. Every 10 years theres a so-called black renaissance, where a bunch of black people get nominated and I get called up. And I get excited, because I know its going to be another nine-year drought. Every time, I say the same thing: Until we get a position of power with a green-light vote, its not going to change. We may win an Oscar now and then, but an Oscar is not going to fundamentally change how Hollywood does business. Im not talking about Hollywood stars, Im talking about executives. Im tired of people calling me about the diversity in Hollywood. My phone is ringing off the hook right now.Q. And youre sick of answering it.A. I am because Ive been getting this call for 30 years. Look, you cant get hooked up on awards, you just got to do the best work you can. Theres a whole history of films that won best film, and nobody is checking for them now, so the work will outlast that stuff."}
{"text": "After decades of complaints about noise and air pollution from the tens of thousands of tourist helicopter flights that circle Manhattan each year, New York City announced a deal on Sunday that would cut their number in half by January 2017.In addition, the helicopters, as familiar a sight on the citys waterfront as sea gulls and joggers, will not fly on Sundays starting April 1 and will be banned from flying over Governors Island and Staten Island. In waterfront parks across the city, activists have measured noise readings in excess of 75 decibels, louder than a vacuum cleaner.The agreement, announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio, was intended to address the complaints while trying to keep aloft a multimillion-dollar industry. Last year, more than 59,000 flights took off from Pier 6 near the Battery, the only heliport that provides the tours.The de Blasio administration hailed the move as a way to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers while protecting an industry that helps pay for operations at the Pier 6 heliport through $2.9 million in rent.Everyone gave a little to get to this outcome, but the solution will mean a more livable city for everyone, Mayor de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement.Yet there are many who believe that even one tourist helicopter is too many.Im happy theres finally movement on the issue, but I have serious doubts that the 50 percent will be enough, Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the West Side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, said. Like many elected officials, Mr. Nadler has been campaigning for an all-out ban on the helicopters dating to the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, something he still believes is the best course of action.According to the agreement, tour operators would have to reduce the number of flights by 20 percent by June, and the following month, they would be required to submit monthly reports tracking flight routes, including whether any helicopters stray too close to land. The aircraft are allowed only over the harbor and Hudson River as far north as the George Washington Bridge. A third-party monitor, paid for by the operators, would also conduct field observations.Currently, 219 people are employed in the industry, according to the citys Economic Development Corporation, including 50 at the Pier 6 heliport, which is owned by the city and operated by Saker Aviation. The tours used to take off from the citys two other heliports, at East 34th Street and West 30th Street, but they were all moved downtown by 2010 after neighborhood opposition.Liberty Helicopters, of Kearny, N.J., has been ferrying tourists around the city for 29 years, employs 100 people and flies 10 helicopters in the summer season, said Chris Vellios, the chief operating officer. Were going to have to roll up our sleeves and make these reductions work, but its better than an outright ban, which the City Council had been considering, Mr. Vellios said.Liberty spent $120,000 lobbying the mayors office and the Economic Development Corporation last year, and the Helicopter Tourism & Jobs Council, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., spent $85,000 on lobbying.Libertys tours charge passengers $150 for 15 minutes and $225 for 20 minutes, and the helicopters can seat up to six people (less, depending on weight).The trips loop along the Brooklyn waterfront, past Governors Island to Red Hook, across to the Statue of Liberty, and then up the Hudson River, leaving every few minutes. Because they do a loop, residents say that it seems as if twice as many helicopters are buzzing by their homes.Its a compromised compromise, John Dellaportas, the president of the Stop the Chop NYNJ and a resident of Battery Park City, said. So instead of a flight every two minutes, it will be one every four minutes.On Sunday afternoon, the heliport was not quite so busy, with tours leaving every five to 10 minutes. A roar would overtake the promenade, sending ripples across the water.Athenie Brake was visiting for the weekend from Alberta, Canada, and had just taken her father, Wayne, out for a birthday tour. She took her mother last year, as well.If this isnt offered on Sundays, we wont be able to take a trip, she said. We just came down for the weekend, and if they dont offer it, we wont get the chance.Josep Genebriera and Nicholas Eklund, from Jacksonville, Fla., said a Sunday ban would have gotten in the way of a birthday surprise Mr. Genebriera had planned. But I guess I could have just booked it for yesterday, Mr. Genebriera said.Air pollution is another concern. Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was co-author of an opinion article that was published over the weekend in The New York Times denouncing the growth of helicopter flights at the same time the city had begun to reclaim its waterfront for recreational space. Mr. Benepe and Merritt Birnbaum, executive director of Governors Island Alliance, wrote that certain helicopters generate 950 pounds of carbon dioxide per hour, more than 42 times the emissions of the average car.Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transporation, conducted a study on the citys heliports in 2012 and found that they had benefits for industries as varied as emergency management and traffic engineering. He warned that banishing tourism flights from the city could drive them to New Jersey, where City Hall would have less sway over routes and hours of operation.One reform that Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, wants to see is identification on the bottom of each helicopter. I have constituents who are out there with binoculars, trying to figure out whos buzzing them all the time, she said.Among them is Ed Windels, a composer who lives on Riverside Drive and 103rd Street. While the helicopters have made working on music challenging, they have allowed Mr. Windels to forgo an alarm clock. It starts at 6:30, every morning, on the dot, he said, though thats not exactly how you want to be woken up, by having your entire building shaking."}

{"text": "Updated, 1:58 p.m. | A committee of the World Health Organization today concluded that theexplosive spread of the mosquito-borne Zika virusconstitutes aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.*But in and around the tropics, public health officials and communities are already fixated on the rapid spread of the virus, particularly given signs (but not yet direct evidence) thatZika is causing the devastating brain malformationmicrocephalyin babies born to some infected women in affected zones in Brazil and elsewhere. Chillingly, over the weekend, Reuters reported that Colombian health officials had found more than 2,100 pregnant women who are infected with the virus.Behind the Zika headlines, there are underlying drivers of disease risk that are not getting sufficient attention. Climate change and El Nino have been mentioned, and  as with any pest and illness restricted to certain temperature zones  can be factors.But most important is the simple fact that, after a burst of effective mosquito eradication decades ago, a host of countries (Brazil in particular) relaxed such efforts, and did so just as humanitys boom in urbanization and global mobility got into high gear.In essence, the tropics are not facing a Zika emergency nearly as much as they are facing anAedes aegyptiemergency.This mosquito species thrives in trash-strewn, puddly cities, bites in daylight (limiting the utility ofbed nets) and has long posed a peril by carrying a host ofdangerous ailments, including yellow fever,chikungunyaand dengue.Zika is simply the newest globe-hopping hitchhiker.The core public health issue right now (unless you are pregnant and living in or visiting an affected region) is in the utter failure of many nations to sustain effectivemosquitocontrols in an era of surging urbanization that has massively expanded the perfect habitat for this dangerous vector.Thankfully, the Entomological Society of America and its Brazilian counterpart have organizeda one-day summit in Brazil(on March 13) aimed at prompting fresh international action on the grand challenge of defeatingthis mosquito species.If you want to see what a lost public-health opportunity looks like and dont mind experiencing a wave of frustration,please read Dengue, Urbanization and Globalization: The Unholy Trinity of the 21st Century, a chilling 2011 paper byDuane J. Gubler, professor and founding director of the emerging infectious disease program at theDuke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.Heres an illustration from the paper showing how Brazil and other countries in the American tropics dealt a huge blow to Aedes mosquitoes in the first half of the 20th century, but then  only partly because of the ban on DDT  dropped their defenses just as humanitys boom in urbanization and global mobility got into high gear.While the paper focuses on dengue (appropriately, given the millions of people are affected by this illness annually), the lessons apply to Zika, as well.Here are a couple of relevant excerpts:In the Americas, epidemic dengue was effectively controlled along with epidemic yellow fever in most of the region by theAe aegypti eradication program that eliminated the mosquito from 23 countries during the 1950s and 1960s [2,20]. When this program was terminated in the early 1970s,Ae aegyptibegan to reinfest tropical countries in the region (Fig.3). This reinvasion byAe aegypti coincided with dramatic urban growth in the American tropics, and by the late 1970s, dengue viruses were beginning to be introduced from Asia [21,22]. DENV-1 was introduced in 1977, followed by DENV-2 and -4 in 1981, and DENV -3 in 1994 [7]. Most likely, multiple strains of each serotype were introduced, and all four became endemic. As hyperendemicity developed, epidemic DHF emerged and currently affects most of the region (Fig.4) [23].The dramatic global geographic expansion and the increased incidence of epidemic dengue coincided exactly with urban growth and globalization [6]. Currently, an estimated 3.6 billion people in 124 countries live in areas of risk for this primarily urban disease.Prevention and control of epidemic dengue has become increasingly problematic. The disease exists in large tropical cities where the mosquito vectors live in intimate contact with the crowded human host. Many of these cities have populations of 15 to 20 million people. To effectively control the mosquito vector using current tools, every house and office in the city must be visited on a weekly basis, a near impossibility without the help of the community. Unfortunately, efforts to develop effective community outreach programs and ownership have largely failed [51].Please read the paper in full. Even though Gubler lists half a dozen smart steps, prognosis for the future is not good.Theres much more on Room for Debate, including this wise entry by Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine: A Campaign to Eliminate Mosquitoes Is Needed Until a Vaccine Is Developed.Relevant Twitter activity | Healthmap.org has a mapping tool for the spread of Zika, the range of the Aedes aegypti mosquito and more (noticed via @Laurie_Garrett at the Council on Foreign Relations:Our #Zika map is LIVE!

{"text": "HERSHEY, Pa.   Less than 21 hours after a game in Syracuse, and less than 17 hours after the team bus rolled back into town, Scott Gomez perched astride the boards at Giant Center, awaiting the first shift of the seventh American Hockey League game of his life.Gomez, a 36-year-old center who was the N.H.L.s top rookie in the 1999-2000 season, had two assists for the Hershey Bears in that game, a 5-1 win over the Syracuse Crunch here on Saturday, and the sellout crowd of 10,964, including dozens of children tooting vuvuzelas, went home happy.Im not just hanging around, Gomez, his bag packed and his tie askew, said as he stood in the empty Hershey locker room afterward.Gomez, who had 181 goals and 574 assists in his 1,066-game N.H.L. career and helped the Devils win two Stanley Cups, was waived on Dec. 30 by the St. Louis Blues, his sixth N.H.L. team. He considered retiring until the man he calls his paid consultant talked him out of it.That consultant is Adam Oates, a Hall of Fame forward who coached the Washington Capitals, the Bears N.H.L. parent club, for two seasons before returning to the Devils, with whom he was one of three coaches last season, alongside Lou Lamoriello and Scott Stevens.Oates, 53, sees Gomezs quest this way: If Jaromir Jagr, who turns 44 on Feb. 15, can thrive with the Florida Panthers despite not being the player he once was, Gomez can find an N.H.L. spot to land  ideally as a third-line, 14-minute-a-game center who can direct a teams power play.I think Gomers still got that skill, Oates said Sunday. If he plays the right minutes and is put in the right situation, he can help somebody. There are parts of his game where hes still elite. Hes an elite passer.Youve got to get that edge back, that conditioning back. In another week or so, he can reach another level of skating, and hopefully an N.H.L. team will notice.Gomez, who played for the Devils for seven years before signing a seven-year, $51.5 million contract with the Rangers, earned a spot with the Devils again last year after Lamoriello, the longtime general manager, promised only a tryout. Gomez had 34 points in 58 games.Gomez said he and Lamoriello had all but agreed to a contract for this season when Lamoriello retired last May, appointing Ray Shero as his successor. Lamoriello was named Torontos general manager in July, and both Oates and Gomez had to look for work.Hey, thats business, Gomez said. There were no hard feelings.Gomez was signed on Oct. 7 by the injury-ravaged Blues, whose assistant general manager, the former goaltender Martin Brodeur, was Gomezs teammate with the Devils. Gomez played in 21 games, recording a goal and seven assists, but was cut after injured players returned.I wasnt in the plan from Day 1; thats what happened, Gomez said. He added: I knew right away I wasnt going to play more than seven or eight minutes a game. Thats not the reason why I went there.Oates had helped him set up the tryout with the Blues. As a way to prepare to coach the Capitals, Oates had become a coach with the Bears, who play 130 miles north of Washington, during the 2012-13 N.H.L. lockout. He suggested to Gomez that he could stay in shape by playing in Hershey. The Bears are the top-drawing team in the 30-club A.H.L.I dont want to say he convinced me, Gomez said of Oates. But he said: Hey, youre still good. Youve still got it.And all the older players I talked to said: Gomer, dont. Youre going to regret it, Gomez said of retiring.Gomezs last game with St. Louis was on Dec. 27. He signed a professional tryout agreement with the Bears on Jan. 14 and played his first game with the team two days later.The Bears have not lost in regulation with Gomez. His coach in Hershey, Troy Mann, said Gomez played his best game Saturday, displaying his vision, his skill set and his playmaking ability.Its very difficult for an N.H.L. player to come down here, because in the N.H.L., you know if you make a play, the guy is going to be there, Mann said, referring to a teammate who receives a pass.Mann, a second-year coach for the Bears who played for 14 teams in his career, all in the minors, added: Thats not always a guarantee in the American League. So thats a difficult adjustment.Wearing No. 39, the reverse of the No. 93 he wore in St. Louis, Gomez played center on Saturday on a line that included left wing Nathan Walker and right wing Riley Barber, both born on Feb. 7, 1994. Walker scored the Bears first goal, Barber the last three. Gomez was the games second star.Barber said it was an honor to play with Gomez.I grew up watching him play for the Devils, Barber said. Its really cool to play with someone who sees the ice so well and wants to help you. Hes been playing great since hes been here. He looks great.Although he is still trying to get back into top hockey shape, Gomez said he generally felt good. He appreciates what Oates, whom he calls hockeys Bill Belichick, has been able to do to extend his career, he said. He can even deal with the long bus rides.Im still the Alaskan kid who came in, Gomez said. Maybe the body gets a little stiffer afterward, but theres no ego. I never had an ego  thats the thing."}
{"text": "Bygones are bygones, Jules Trump said, looking back on a legal skirmish that involved nothing more than whats in a name: his name, or, specifically, the Trump Organization (Donald J. Trump) and the Trump Group (Jules Trump and his brother, Eddie).Like Donald J. Trump before he became a Republican presidential candidate or a reality-television personality, Jules and Eddie Trump are real estate developers, and rich.In 2013, ABC News reported that a research firm, Wealth-X, ranked Eddie as No. 35 on a list of the 50 most influential ultrahigh-net-worth individuals. He was the only Trump on a list that started and ended with Microsofts co-founders: Bill Gates was No. 1, and Paul G. Allen, who owns the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers, was No. 50. Donald Trump, who hopes to win the Iowa caucuses on Monday, was nowhere on the list, which also included the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman at No. 3, and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett at No. 5.Since the 1980s, Jules and Eddie Trump, who are not related to Donald, have built several luxury developments in Florida, including the Mansions at Acqualina, north of Miami, and on Williams Island. The Trumps apartment buildings have been home to Whitney Houston and Jimmy Johnson, the former head coach of the Miami Dolphins and the Dallas Cowboys.Back when Donald Trump was calling news conferences to say he had refurbished the Central Park skating rink ahead of schedule and $750,000 under budget, the other Trumps had an office a short walk from the Trump Tower on the east side of Fifth Avenue at 56th Street. In the 1980s, their names, or the name Trump Group, appeared in The New York Times fewer than 15 times. Donald Trumps name, or references to his Trump Organization, appeared more than 2,000 times.In the 1990s, when he was taking up with Marla Maples, divorcing Ivana Trump and marrying and divorcing Ms. Maples, the Trump name appeared about the same number of times. The other Trumps name count dropped to two.One of the articles was about Trump v. Trump, a case that had begun in the 1980s, when Donald Trump sent his lawyer, Roy M. Cohn, to State Supreme Court in Manhattan to stop Jules and Eddie from using the name they were born with.He claimed that their use of the Trump name was designed to reap the benefits of his. He also said it constituted unfair competition.The brothers, in fact, had the name first, although they did not make that argument in the case. Jules Trump is 72. Eddie Trump is 69, the same age as Donald. But Eddie, born in April 1946, is two months older.The court papers, preserved in microfiche, reside in a cabinet deep in the basement of the New York County Courthouse on Centre Street in Manhattan. To view the small negative-like sheets is to read about same-name cases from even earlier that were cited by the lawyers. One such case was Ed Sullivan v. Ed Sullivan Radio & TV, in which the host of a really big show appealed a lower-court ruling in favor of Edward J. Sullivan, an owner of a Buffalo repair shop.If they were arguing the case now, the lawyers could mention more recent tussles over names. In 2010, a former Los Angeles drug kingpin known as Freeway Ricky Ross sued the Miami rapper who performed as Rick Ross. Last year, an appellate judge in California ruled in favor of the rap star, who was born William Leonard Roberts and was a correction officer before he became a performer. The judge, Roger Boren, said Mr. Robertss use of a stage name was protected by the First Amendment.In the Trump case, Donald said in court papers that he had received inquiries from financial institutions about deals that the other Trumps were considering. He said that the calls pointed to confusion over which Trumps were which.After an inquiry from a magazine publisher  David Q. Mahler, the vice president of a company that owned trade magazines  Donald Trump went to court.Welcome to the chain drugstore industry, Mr. Mahler wrote in a letter, urging Donald Trump to follow other leaders in the field and become an active subscriber to one of his magazines, Drugstore News.He was soliciting the wrong Trump. A unit of Jules and Eddies company had just acquired a drugstore chain called Pay n Save, and Mr. Mahler knew all about the company. You couldnt work with a better group of executives than those that are part of Pay n Save management, he wrote.Donald Trump eventually lost the case in State Supreme Court, but he had a two-pronged legal strategy. He had petitioned the federal Patent and Trademark Office to revoke the registration of the Trump Groups trademark, which it did. The brothers could continue to use the name Trump Group, which they have, but they lost the legal benefits of having a trademark in 1988.So, as Donald Trump said in a telephone interview on Friday, I got the name.Theyre also really nice guys, he said of the other Trumps. Im friends with them. Theyre quality guys. They do quality developments. I see them around, sometimes at the U.S. Open tennis. Really nice guys.Did he know that when he sued them? Did he know them then? No, he said. I never sue people that I know if I like them. I didnt know them, and then I got to know them after that.For his part, Jules Trumps response to a reporters call about the lawsuits was, I dont want to get into that.Thereve never been any issues with him since then, he said. But you know, weve engaged socially, and it was fine.Donald Trump got the name. Would he get Jules Trumps vote?Hes a remarkable person, hes an incredible person, he said. He paused, and then added: Whether Id vote for him? Im not getting into my political preferences.But reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show that he gave $25,000 to Conservative Solutions PAC, which is supporting Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida."}
{"text": "A new approach to treating early schizophrenia, which includes family counseling, results in improvements in quality of life that make it worth the added expense, researchers reported on Monday.The study, published by the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, is the first rigorous cost analysis of a federally backed treatment program that more than a dozen states have begun trying. In contrast to traditional outpatient care, which generally provides only services covered by insurance, like drugs and some psychotherapy, the new program offers other forms of support, such as help with jobs and school, as well as family counseling.The program also tries to include the patients  people struggling with a first psychotic break from reality, most of them in their late teens and 20s  as equals in decisions about care, including drug dosage.In a widely anticipated study last fall, called the Raise trial, researchers reported that after two years, people who got this more comprehensive care did better on a variety of measures than those who received the standard care. But the study found no evidence of related cost savings or differences in hospitalization rates, a prime driver of expense. As lawmakers in Washington are considering broad changes in mental health care, cost issues loom especially large.Outside experts said this analysis  which was based on the Raise trial data  was an important test of the new care programs value.This is the way cost analysis should be done, Sherry Glied, a professor of public service and the dean of New York Universitys graduate school of public service, said. One way to think about it is to ask, if this program were a drug, would we pay for it? And the answer is yes.Swaying policy makers will take far more work, others said.This study shows that the treatment is promising, in a research setting, said Thomas McGuire, a professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School. Well still need to see how it works in the real world, whether it makes sense for community mental health clinics.The new research, led by Dr. Robert Rosenheck of the Yale School of Medicine, included 183 people who received typical care and 223 who got the more comprehensive services. The study aimed in part to assess whether investing more money in early treatment might forestall much higher costs later on.The new analysis could not settle that question, because it compiled data from only two years. (Lifetime studies could estimate differences such as whether people stay in the workplace or off government assistance.) The researchers evaluated the costs of all added services, including the price for training and mounting the new program, and asked what differences in average quality of life that money yielded.The treatment package cost about $3,600 a year more than traditional outpatient care, the researchers found, and resulted in an improvement of about 13 percent over the usual care. That measure included how patients were doing at home, in their primary relationships and in school or at work.We then had to ask, How do we put a precise value on improved quality of life? Dr. Rosenheck said.Using standard scales applied to other health care, like medications and operations, the team found that the new approach delivered about the same value of health benefits as other widely accepted treatments, like statin drugs to prevent heart attacks, Dr. Rosenheck said, and was more cost effective than many cancer therapies.The extra money spent, in short, is at the low end of the range of services we already pay for, Dr. Glied said.This cost-benefit ratio may improve in the coming years. Many medications used for schizophrenia are close to becoming generic, which would lower the average added expense of the new program to about $2,000 a year. But given the uncertainties of a chronic condition like schizophrenia, experts said the new study should be considered a good first-term report card, not a final rating.One thing thats incontrovertible is that when a child develops schizophrenia, your lifes a mess. A truck has just run you over, Dr. Rosenheck said. If nothing else, this intervention provides support for individuals and families at the worst times of their lives. It tells you that you will not be alone  theres people looking to make this better."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Why Arent Women Doing Better on Wall Street?, by Maureen Sherry (Sunday Review, Jan. 24):As a female partner at a leading employment discrimination law firm, I can confirm that Ms. Sherry accurately depicts the gender bias and sexual harassment that remain rampant in the financial services industry.But gender discrimination continues unabated on Wall Street not because of the Form U4, despite what she suggests, as the U4 eliminated sex discrimination claims from its arbitration clause about 15 years ago.The real source of the problem is that employers force women to sign agreements in addition to the U4 that inflict a double injustice by denying women public access to courts and forcing them to waive their right to participate in class actions alleging gender bias.By carefully hiding arbitration clauses in written employee policies, handbooks and manuals, sophisticated employers strong-arm women into eliminating their collective voice  a critical tool necessary for change, especially where claims of systemic discrimination exist.Until employers are forced out from a tribunal cloaked in secrecy and filled with decision makers and rules stacked in their favor, women will continue to hear derogatory moo sounds on their way to the break room with a breast pump in hand.JEANNE CHRISTENSENNew YorkTo the Editor:I think most of those men would be deeply embarrassed to have their mothers, sisters or girlfriends find out that they behaved so badly toward a female colleague, such as groping a womans breast to settle a bet. Men (and probably women, too) behave differently when they are in competitive groups that not only condone sexist behavior, but also applaud it with approving laughter. Young, insecure men can easily be egged on to follow the bad example of a more successful peer. That is why corporate culture and rules need to change. Its not enough to tell women to lean in.EVELYN WOTHERSPOONCalgary, AlbertaTo the Editor:Unfortunately it is not just the banking industry that suffers from these problems or uses devices like arbitration agreements as a management firewall.In my over 36 years in corporate finance, the only times Ive seen things get dramatically better is when women are in a position to build their own teams. Its amazing how quickly female talent starts to grow when before it seemed so difficult for male executives to find women who were ready for leadership roles.As for the corporations themselves, keep your expectations of humanity and caring in line with an entity that isnt human and cares only for itself. Its better that way.JAMES BOYKENGrand Isle, Vt."}
{"text": "Dolores Madrigal remembered being told that her sterilization could be reversed. Jovita Rivera and Georgina Hernndez said they were bullied by doctors and nurses who declared their children burdens on California taxpayers. Melvina Hernandez did not find out that her tubes had been cut until four years after her son was born.In 1975, these four women were among the 10 plaintiffs who filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court claiming that the Los Angeles County U.S.C. Medical Center was systematically sterilizing Spanish-speaking mothers who delivered their babies via cesarean section.Madrigal v. Quilligan was, from its outset, the kind of striking David-versus-Goliath story that Hollywood and history books usually love  Erin Brockovich with an East L.A. twist. It was championed by a Latina fresh out of law school, and backed by the marginalized feminist wing of a growing Chicano activist movement. It was directed against some of most the powerful institutions in the state, including the Department of Health and the University of Southern California. The events in the trial even had a famous setting: For decades, Los Angeles County hospital served as an exterior shot for the soap opera General Hospital. And the claims were disturbing  that the hospital had made a practice of misleading women about sterilization and coercing them into giving consent.Yet when Virginia Espino, a historian, began researching the case in 1994, almost all these details had been lost and forgotten. For years, Espino could not even obtain complete copies of the court documents at the County Hall of Records. They said that it was lost, missing, somebody had borrowed it, she told me. They couldnt find it. And until Espino teamed up with her friend, the Academy-Award-nominated filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pea (Who Killed Vincent Chin?), the public had never heard any of the plaintiffs describe their own experiences with the ill-fated suit. The documentary that sprang from their collaboration  No Ms Bebs (No More Babies), which is being broadcast on PBS tonight  aimed to change that.Madrigal v. Quilligan revolved around two fundamental questions: Did obstetricians at County Hospital perform tubal ligations on their patients without proper consent? And did doctors single out Latinas for the procedures?When the suit came to trial in 1978, Judge Jesse W. Curtis ruled that neither of these charges was true. This case is essentially the result of a breakdown in communications between the patients and the doctors, Curtis wrote. Misunderstandings occurred because the women were, primarily, Spanish-speakers. Some of them, including Dolores Madrigal and Consuelo Hermosillo, had even signed consent forms for their procedures. Their emotional distress at being sterilized, Curtis wrote, was caused by their cultural background as immigrants from rural Mexico who believed that a womans worth is tied to her ability to raise a large family  not by their sterilizations. Dr. E.J. Quilligan, the head of County Hospitals obstetrics unit (and a pioneer in lifesaving fetal-monitoring technology) told a reporter, We were practicing good medicine.The disconnect between Curtiss ruling and Tajima-Peas portrayal of the same events in No Ms Bebs may be due, in part, to changes in our notions of what consent should mean. As Dr. Karen Benker, the only physician to testify against the hospital, explained to me last fall, the notion of voluntary informed consent barely existed during the early 1970s. (The National Research Act, which required doctors to get voluntary informed consent from the subjects of their experiments, wasnt passed until 1974, after the abuses of the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male were made public.) Asking a woman to consider and sign off on an irreversible contraceptive procedure in the midst of her worst labor pains? In 1973, amid federal initiatives to encourage birth control and family planning, that might be construed as good medicine.And No Ms Bebs suggests that the environment at County Hospital made coercion and deception very possible, even if it wasnt authorized. According to the film, more than 1,000 babies were born there every month during the 1970s, with no clear protocol for their delivery. Women labored on gurneys in the hallways, assigned to no particular doctor. One night, Benker told me, she saw a medical resident hold a hypodermic needle filled with painkiller in front of an African-American woman in labor and say: You want this? You want the pain to go away? Well, sign this [sterilization consent] paper!According to Benker, the patients in Countys obstetrics unit were mostly low-income African-American and Mexican-American women. If the rates of sterilization were highest among Latinas, that could have been a result of practical realities, not deliberate policy. I think it was easier to coerce or to trick who people who didnt speak English well or who didnt read English well, she told me, or whose immigration status might have made them feel afraid.Disturbed by the situation, another resident in Countys obstetrics unit, Dr. Bernard Rosenfeld, quietly copied the medical records for hundreds of sterilizations. Eventually, he passed this documentation along to Antonia Hernndez, a recent graduate from U.C.L.A. Law School who worked at the Los Angeles Center for Law & Justice, a legal advocacy group just a few blocks away from County Hospital. She and her colleagues joined forces with the Chicana feminist organization Comisin Feminil, led by a legal secretary named Gloria Molina, to build a case on the foundations laid by the recently decided Roe v. Wade. If a woman had a civil right to terminate a pregnancy, they argued, she also had a civil right to procreate.Like many of the plaintiffs that Hernndez and Molina persuaded to join Madrigal v. Quilligan, Consuelo Hermosillo initially wanted nothing to do with the case. Her sterilization at County hospital had become a secret so painful that she and her husband never shared it with anyone. They did not even discuss it when they were alone. But after Hernndez showed her the evidence Rosenfeld had gathered, Hermosillo joined the suit, without telling her husband, in hopes that would help protect other women  perhaps even her two daughters. She told a baby sitter she was going to work and rode a bus alone to the courthouse, angry, ashamed and afraid.After Judge Curtiss ruling, Hermosillos silence cemented. She never built friendships with the other plaintiffs. Some of them, shed learned, were being beaten and castigated by their husbands for being sterilized. Her husband didnt do that. But Hermosillo had no one to confide in either. Once, she told me, she accompanied her son to a funeral for his friends mother and was surprised by the photographs at the wake: Until that moment, she had no idea that the deceased was also one of the Madrigal Ten.Though the hospital won, Madrigal changed state laws and buttressed the careers of several prominent Latino politicians. In its wake, the California Department of Health revised its sterilization guidelines to include a 72-hour waiting period and issued a booklet on sterilization in Spanish. The California State Legislature unanimously repealed its sterilization law, which had legalized over 20,000 nonconsensual procedures since 1909. Hernndez went on to become the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund; Molina later became the first Chicana elected to the Los Angeles City Council.What interested me about this case, Tajima-Pena told me, is how you have well-meaning policy and some very well-meaning doctors, and how women could still be abused. Where Espino sees a history of backdoor eugenics, Tajima-Pena is more persuaded by the sociologist Elena Gutirrezs argument that the sterilizations at County Hospital were a result of a perfect storm of pressures: fears about a global population bomb mixing with prejudice against welfare use and illegitimacy, accelerated by a rush of federal funding for family planning through the War on Poverty.To sort of claim that were part of a greater goal of sterilizing the Mexican population that immigrates to Los Angeles, Dr. Michael Kreitzer, a defendant in Madrigal v. Quilligan, says in the film  Im offended by that. Thats not what we did. Thats not what we discussed. Thats not what anybody even intimated.Its not like these evil old white guys are the problem, Tajima-Pea told me, the day before No Ms Bebs screened at the NYC Doc festival in November. Were all the problem. Because we all have this really complicated, maybe misguided thinking about what reproductive freedom really means. Such beliefs are still common even among progressives, she pointed out. When she and Espino showed rough cuts of the film to friendly audiences before its June debut, people would find out that one of the plaintiffs, Maria Hurtado, had five children and say, Well, she already had five kids.But Espino is not the only historian to look at Madrigal v. Quilligan and think of eugenics. Alexandra Minna Stern, a professor at the University of Michigan, has documented that, by the 1940s, California accounted for 60 percent of sterilizations performed nationwide. The operations, she found, always disproportionately affected African-Americans and foreign-born residents  including immigrants from Italy, Poland, Scandinavia, Russia and Germany. Mexican-Americans were long singled out for special attention. In Sterns book Eugenic Nation, Madrigal v. Quilligan appears as a concluding link in Californias protracted history of eugenics.That concept of were being threatened by this overbreeding subpopulation seems to be a very powerful strain in our culture, Benker says. Two years before Hernndez filed Madrigal v. Quilligan in California, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed Relf v. Weinberger in Washington. That case, which revolved around the sterilization of two African-American sisters, 14 and 12 years old, at a family-planning clinic in Alabama, revealed that more than 100,000 poor people were being sterilized every year under federally funded programs. According to the S.P.L.C., Countless others were forced to agree to be sterilized when doctors threatened to terminate their welfare benefits unless they consented to the procedures.You can detect the same strain in the arguments once used to support Proposition 187 in California, which barred unauthorized immigrants from using some state services, and in the justifications for denying Mexican-American children birth certificates in Texas. It runs through the current movement to repeal the 14th Amendment. No Ms Bebs is an investigation into what happened at one hospital during the early 1970s, but the larger questions it raises are still with us today: Who do we believe is allowed to create citizens in our country? Does it matter what they look like? Does it matter which languages they speak?No Ms Bebs will be shown on PBSs Independent Lens tonight at 10 p.m."}
{"text": "So whats really at stake in this years election? Well, among other things, the fate of the planet.Last year was the hottest on record, by a wide margin, which should  but wont  put an end to climate deniers claims that global warming has stopped. The truth is that climate change just keeps getting scarier; it is, by far, the most important policy issue facing America and the world. Still, this election wouldnt have much bearing on the issue if there were no prospect of effective action against the looming catastrophe.But the situation on that front has changed drastically for the better in recent years, because were now achingly close to achieving a renewable-energy revolution. Whats more, getting that energy revolution wouldnt require a political revolution. All it would take are fairly modest policy changes, some of which have already happened and others of which are already underway. But those changes wont happen if the wrong people end up in power.To see what Im talking about, you need to know something about the current state of climate economics, which has changed far more in recent years than most people seem to realize.Most people who think about the issue at all probably imagine that achieving a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would necessarily involve big economic sacrifices. This view is required orthodoxy on the right, where it forms a sort of second line of defense against action, just in case denial of climate science and witch hunts against climate scientists dont do the trick. For example, in the last Republican debate Marco Rubio  the last, best hope of the G.O.P. establishment  insisted, as he has before, that a cap-and-trade program would be devastating for our economy.To find anything equivalent on the left you have to go far out of the mainstream, to activists who insist that climate change cant be fought without overthrowing capitalism. Still, my sense is that many Democrats believe that politics as usual isnt up to the task, that we need a political earthquake to make real action possible. In particular, I keep hearing that the Obama administrations environmental efforts have been so far short of whats needed as to be barely worth mentioning.But things are actually much more hopeful than that, thanks to remarkable technological progress in renewable energy.The numbers are really stunning. According to a recent report by the investment firm Lazard, the cost of electricity generation using wind power fell 61 percent from 2009 to 2015, while the cost of solar power fell 82 percent. These numbers  which are in line with other estimates  show progress at rates we normally only expect to see for information technology. And they put the cost of renewable energy into a range where its competitive with fossil fuels.Now, there are still some issues special to renewables, in particular problems of intermittency: consumers may want power when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine. But this issue seems to be of diminishing significance, partly thanks to improving storage technology, partly thanks to the realization that demand response  paying consumers to cut energy use during peak periods  can greatly reduce the problem.So what will it take to achieve a large-scale shift from fossil fuels to renewables, a shift to sun and wind instead of fire? Financial incentives, and they dont have to be all that huge. Tax credits for renewables that were part of the Obama stimulus plan, and were extended under the recent budget deal, have already done a lot to accelerate the energy revolution. The Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan, which if implemented will create strong incentives to move away from coal, will do much more.And none of this will require new legislation; we can have an energy revolution even if the crazies retain control of the House.Now, skeptics may point out that even if all these good things happen, they wont be enough on their own to save the planet. For one thing, were only talking about electricity generation, which is a big part of the climate change problem but not the whole thing. For another, were only talking about one country when the problem is global.But Id argue that the kind of progress now within reach could produce a tipping point, in the right direction. Once renewable energy becomes an obvious success and, yes, a powerful interest group, anti-environmentalism will start to lose its political grip. And an energy revolution in America would let us take the lead in global action.Salvation from climate catastrophe is, in short, something we can realistically hope to see happen, with no political miracle necessary. But failure is also a very real possibility. Everything is hanging in the balance."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   For more than two years the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies have warned that encrypted communications are creating a going dark crisis that will keep them from tracking terrorists and kidnappers.Now, a study in which current and former intelligence officials participated concludes that the warning is wildly overblown, and that a raft of new technologies  like television sets with microphones and web-connected cars  are creating ample opportunities for the government to track suspects, many of them worrying.Going dark does not aptly describe the long-term landscape for government surveillance, concludes the study, to be published Monday by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.The study argues that the phrase ignores the flood of new technologies being packed with sensors and wireless connectivity that are expected to become the subject of court orders and subpoenas, and are already the target of the National Security Agency as it places implants into networks around the world to monitor communications abroad.The products, ranging from toasters to bedsheets, light bulbs, cameras, toothbrushes, door locks, cars, watches and other wearables, will give the government increasing opportunities to track suspects and in many cases reconstruct communications and meetings.The study, titled, Dont Panic: Making Progress on the Going Dark Debate, is among the sharpest counterpoints yet to the contentions of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and other Justice Department officials, mostly by arguing that they have defined the issue too narrowly.Over the past year, they have repeatedly told Congress that the move by Apple to automatically encrypt data on its iPhone, and similar steps by Google and Microsoft, are choking off critical abilities to track suspects, even with a court order.President Obama, however, concluded last fall that any effort to legislate a government back door into encrypted communications would probably create a pathway for hackers  including those working for foreign governments like Russia, China and Iran  to gain access as well, and create a precedent for authoritarian governments demanding similar access.Most Republican candidates for president have demanded that technology companies create a way for investigators to unlock encrypted communications, and on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough line on Silicon Valley companies, urging them to join the fight against the Islamic State.Apples chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has led the charge on the other side. He recently told a group of White House officials seeking technology companies voluntary help to counter the Islamic State that the governments efforts to get the keys to encrypted communications would be a boon for hackers and put legitimate business transactions, financial data and personal communications at greater risk.The Harvard study, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, was unusual because it involved technical experts, civil libertarians and officials who are, or have been, on the forefront of counterterrorism. Larry Kramer, the former dean of Stanford Law School, who heads the foundation, noted Friday that until now the policy debate has been impeded by gaps in trust  chasms, really  between academia, civil society, the private sector and the intelligence community that have impeded the evolution of a safe, open and resilient Internet.Among the chief authors of the report is Matthew G. Olsen, who was a director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Mr. Obama and a general counsel of the National Security Agency.Two current senior officials of the N.S.A.  John DeLong, the head of the agencys Commercial Solutions Center, and Anne Neuberger, the agencys chief risk officer  are described in the report as core members of the group, but did not sign the report because they could not act on behalf of the agency or the United States government in endorsing its conclusions, government officials said.Encryption is a real problem, and the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies are right to raise it, Mr. Olsen said Sunday. But he noted that in their testimony officials had not described the other technological breaks that are falling their way, nor had they highlighted cases in which they were able to exploit mistakes made by suspects in applying encryption to their messages.Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of law and computer science at Harvard who convened the group, said in an interview that the goal was to have a discussion among people with very different points of view that would move the state of the debate beyond its well-known bumper stickers. We managed to do that in part by thinking of a larger picture, specifically in the unexpected ways that surveillance might be attempted.He noted that in the current stalemate there was little discussion of the ever-expanding Internet of things, where telemetry from teakettles, televisions and light bulbs might prove surprisingly, and worryingly, amenable to subpoena from governments around the world.Those technologies are already being exploited: The government frequently seeks location data from devices like cellphones and EZ Passes to track suspects.The study notes that such opportunities are expanding rapidly. A Samsung smart television contains a microphone meant to relay back to Samsung voice instructions to the TV  I want to see the last three Star Wars movies  and a Hello, Barbie brought out by Mattel last year records childrens conversations with the doll, processes them over the Internet and sends back a response.The history of technology shows that what is invented for convenience can soon become a target of surveillance. Law enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target, the report said.These communications, too, may one day be encrypted. But Googles business model depends on picking out key words from emails to tailor advertisements for specific users of Gmail, the popular email service. Apple users routinely back up the contents of their phones to iCloud  a service that is not encrypted and now is almost a routine target for investigators or intelligence agencies. So are the tracking and mapping systems for cars that rely on transmitted global positioning data.I think what this report shows is that the world today is like living in a big field that is more illuminated than ever before, said Joseph Nye, a Harvard government professor and former head of the National Intelligence Council. There will be dark spots  there always will be. But its easy to forget that there is far more data available to governments now than ever before."}
{"text": "BURNS, Ore.   Remote Western towns, in midwinters grip, definitely have some romance to them. But this one has become a circus tent: A giddy but tense crush of humanity has descended here in rural eastern Oregon, benefiting businesses and swamping them, filling bars, and making motel rooms unattainable amid a bizarre tide of guns, police, reporters and ideologues quoting (at length) from the United States Constitution.Thats Burns.There is no question things have been rough here. The armed occupation that began on Jan. 2 at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge outside town has dragged on, and tensions heightened last week with the fatal shooting of one of the most visible occupiers, LaVoy Finicum, by Oregon State Police troopers in an arrest that went bad.The place is just crazily overrun. Every motel room within 70 miles is taken. Barstools are packed at the Central Pastime Tavern, with journalists and armed antigovernment protesters elbow to elbow, tucking down I.P.A.s and perhaps  for braver souls  the bull testicles on the bar menu. Hard to know, but there are probably also undercover F.B.I. agents now and then playing pool in the back, trying to appear like locals in boots and jeans under the mounted bighorn sheep and buffalo heads.Residents have argued with each other over what to think about the occupiers and their goals, and they have wounded one another in the process.Anxieties could ratchet up again this week, with a protest planned for Monday at the Harney County courthouse by self-styled patriot groups angry about Mr. Finicums death. The United States Marshals Office also said Sunday that one of the 11 people arrested in the standoff  Shawna Cox  had been released, though the authorities would not provide other details. A judge had previously said Ms. Cox could not leave custody until the occupation had ended.But heres the thing: For the most part, Burns has not stopped being warm and welcoming to outsiders, even as that has become harder to do. If you were going to spend nearly the entire month of January in a town of about 2,000 people  isolated by distance in the high eastern Oregon desert, and often with bad weather to boot  you could do a lot worse.We just decided to be kind, said Leah Planinz, who owns Glory Days Pizza with her husband, Nick. She was perhaps talking partly about her philosophy, but more specifically about the restaurants overstuffed brown leather couch in the back near the arcade room.The Planinzes, who are both in their mid-30s and have three children together, live above the shop. Last week near closing time, a desperate reporter (who does not work for The New York Times) wandered in. A kind woman at a motel across the street who had no vacancies told him that Glory Days had a couch. Was there any possibility, he asked, that he could throw down a sleeping bag?Of course! The Planinzes initially refused to take any money, though finally they accepted $20.A similar thing happened at the Sage Country Inn, a farmhouse bed-and-breakfast built in 1907 just down the street. I have been happily holed up there in a camper out back, thanks to the take-in-a-stranger kindness of the inns owners, Mike and Corinne Huseby. The Husebys typically have one or two guests over the entire month of January and never, until now, imagined offering the camper  let alone anyone being thrilled about taking it. (On a personal note: The space heaters keep the camper toasty, but a midnight trip to the bathroom in Mr. Husebys workshop garage can make you wish you hadnt had that I.P.A. at the Pastime.)Sometimes the cracks show. Thats evident at the Narrows R.V. park and cafe, out by the now-closed road into the refuge, where four protesters are holding out. The occupations jailed leader, Ammon Bundy, has asked the four, in a message through his lawyer, to leave.But the courthouse protest planned for Monday could raise tensions and intransigence all over again, with at least 200 people expected, according to one organizer. Some of the protesters have made references to the Black Lives Matter movement and plan to carry signs bearing Mr. Finicums picture and the words All Lives Matter.So the world watches and waits. And the Narrows has become an oasis for everyone involved: protesters with AR-15s across their chests, journalists clutching camera gear, Patagonia-clad environmentalists who have come to protest the protest. Everyone uses the same bathrooms and Wi-Fi and eats cheeseburgers at neighboring tables.And Linda Gainer, 63, who runs the place, has become a kind of mother figure to all. She doles out coffee and breakfast along with phone numbers and directions, chatting with everyone  politics left and right, no matter  as her business becomes a tangle of winter jackets, computer cords, firearms and protest signs.That she welcomes all has become a problem for her. In the early days of the occupation, a local news report implied that Ms. Gainer had donated food to the occupiers. She said the protesters had paid for it, but suddenly found herself slammed with criticism from people  mostly from beyond Burns  who accused her of propping up the rebellion.We will never be stopping at your place again, wrote one man, a bird enthusiast who promised to organize a boycott. My only regret is that we wont be seeing your sweet dog again.Please stop feeding the American Terrorists, wrote another. And a third: You are providing aid to the domestic terrorists that are occupying a federal building near Burns. They should be in jail and so should you.The conflict has left Ms. Gainer and her small staff  Lori, Anna and Vicki  frazzled and worried. This was the busiest January theyve had. (Thats a phrase you hear all around town.) But bird enthusiasts are their lifeblood, and if they boycott (birding season starts next month at the Malheur, when the first migrating sandhill cranes, tundra swans and northern pintails arrive), it could kill the cafe.Were really worried that this business may not stay in business, Ms. Gainer said. It depends on how the birders react.Sometimes you can hear in a single shouted utterance a bit of the question, or prayer, just under the surface in the tumultuous and strange month of January 2016: What the heck happened? What became of the town I knew, of snowy high desert and empty quiet vistas, where January was the time when you took a breath and said, Yes! Im here because the world and its fusses are somewhere else.That shout erupted at the Narrows on a recent afternoon when a surge of lunch orders flooded the kitchen.Plates and pans clattered. Then a womans voice cried out, sounding near tears. Im working as fast as I can! she shouted, and the room went suddenly still."}

{"text": "HALMSTAD, Sweden   Scores of masked men dressed in black, some carrying wooden weapons, descended on the center of Stockholm, gathering near the entrance to the citys main subway station.They had come, the authorities said, to beat and terrorize young migrants, large numbers of whom have been arriving in Sweden since late last year. A flier had served as a sort of call to arms.Because of that, the police were waiting for them.Thomas Westin, a station chief with the Stockholm City Police, said on Sunday that the police had received a tip on Friday that gangs with ties to various soccer teams, who are usually rivals, as well as extremist groups were planning to gather in the center of Stockholm Friday night to attack migrants.The flier  with the headline Its enough now!  calling on people to partake in the anti-immigrant actions had been distributed earlier on Friday, Mr. Westin said.They planned to single out migrants who had come to Sweden as unaccompanied minors, the police said. The police cited the arrests of young migrants in the recent murder of a social worker and in a gang rape last year, as well as the attacks on women that have occurred in Cologne, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe.Video footage from news sites showed a band of men dispersing in Sergels Torg, a square near Central Station, the citys main train station, as the police approached.Three people were arrested, one for striking a police officer and resisting arrest. There were no reports of migrants having been attacked, according to the authorities.The fact that these football firms worked together on Friday is very unusual, Mr. Westin said, adding that the recent high-profile crimes might have helped provoke the actions.Weve had a few incidents, Mr. Westin said, referring to the murder of the social worker, Alexandra Mezher, 22, who was stabbed last Monday at a home for unaccompanied minors in Gothenburg where she worked. One of the residents has been arrested in the crime.More than 35,000 unaccompanied minors sought asylum in Sweden last year, according to the Swedish Migration Agencys website. About two-thirds of them arrived in the last four months of the year.The police have been getting calls from homes for unaccompanied minors asking if it is safe for their residents to go to Stockholm, Mr. Westin said."}
{"text": "Impractical Jokers is just dumb fun, but what do you expect from a prank show in which loud comics accost strangers on the streets?Perhaps more than you did before the premieres of Nathan for You and Billy on the Street. Fair enough. Jokers, entering its fifth season on TruTV, is not of that caliber, but it has earned a devoted audience because of the camaraderie and frat house charms of its four stars, old friends from Staten Island who dare one another to ask strangers to, among other things, sign an anti-rain petition or shake hands in a department store.These comics (Joe Gatto, James Murray, Brian Quinn and Sal Vulcano) sold out three shows at Radio City Music Hall over the weekend. On Saturday night, in an atmosphere resembling a fan convention, audience members shouted lines from the television show as the guys played clips from it, told stories, mugged and looked generally amazed that they were performing at such a storied theater. At one point, they brought their nieces and nephews onstage.Since they cant pull pranks live, the comics, who make up the Tenderloins troupe, need to rely on more traditional jokes. As a consequence, the live show feels like a meal without the main course. These comics dont deliver punch lines so much as hammer them, always finishing with a boisterous cackle. Nothing is left to the imagination. If one of the four comics does a funny walk, they all laugh. Then another says You walk funny before a third ends any ambiguity about the source of the joke: Thats why everyone thinks youre gay.Their puerile humor veers from the locker room to the borscht belt to the kiddie pool. (Youre not Channing Tatum. Youre Fatting Chatum.) Mr. Gatto favors broad physical gestures, while Mr. Vulcano has the funniest delivery, mixing an occasional deadpan into the raucous riffing. Mr. Murray is the most emphatic, slapping his knee, but also perhaps the most shameless in going for the gross-out joke. Toward the end of the live show, he tells a story of going to the bathroom prematurely in the parking lot of a hotel. His humiliation is played for laughs by his friends, but a sense of embarrassment is tempered by their grand finale, in which they play a clip of Mr. Vulcano daring Mr. Murray to swallow dog excrement.When he gulps it down, the camera pans to his friends doubled over in laughter, then back to Mr. Murray. From the triumphant smile on his face, you can guess what hes thinking: The audience members are going to eat this up."}
{"text": "Yeah, this is how I like my Mulder! Scully, you took the words right out of my mouth.After the heaviness of the last two episodes, The X-Files took a welcome comedic and existentialist turn this week. Even with a were-lizard that can shoot blood from its eyeballs, this was a feel-good hour that gave Mulder some of his mojo back.At first, we find our hero doubting himself and asking some of the same questions reviewers and critics have been: I am a middle-aged man, Scully, no, I am, I am. Im thinking maybe its time to put away childish things, the Sasquatches, and mothmen and jackalopes. I thought itd be great to get back to work, but is this really how I want to spend the rest of my days, chasing after monsters? Weve all been there, right?As Mulder has said time and time again, he wants to believe. Skimming old case files, though, he finds that since he and Scully have been away, much of the unexplained has been explained. What is our agent to do? Hes not sure, but hes pretty convincingly down.But what he finds when he and Scully go in search of a predatory beast is validation and a sort of benediction. Also, a serial killer.O.K., Scully actually finds the serial killer. And while she takes everything in stride, she is as giddy (or at least as giddy as is possible for Scully) to have Mulder once again trying to convince her that what they are chasing is actually a monster. She cheerfully calls Mulder crazy and asks him seriously if hes off his meds, but brightens at his characteristic enthusiasm for the possibility of the paranormal.In an inspired twist, the shows writers delightfully invert the monster formula. In this episode, the monster theyre chasing is a monster and wants to be a monster, and he is alarmed that hes having fits of humanness after getting bitten by the real, human killer. (The serial killer/animal-control officer is played by Kumail Nanjiani, who is Dinesh Chugtai on HBOs Silicon Valley. Mr. Nanjiani is a huge X-Files fan and hosts a podcast called The X-Files Files.)This monster, played by the New Zealand comic Rhys Darby, tells Mulder his story, which is really Mulders story, of being a monster (or a rogue F.B.I. agent) and being confident in who you are. When he turns into a regular man (trickily named Guy Mann), though, he is subjugated into a mundane existence, when all he really wants is to return to his former self. Their chat, in a cemetery, goes on a little long (about 15 minutes in an hourlong episode), and includes a tone-deaf transgender joke, but the were-lizard is a walking, talking epiphany for Mulder. If theres nothing more to life than what we already know, Guy says, then there is nothing but worries, self-doubt, regret and loneliness. He gets Mulder to the point of doing what he has been longing to do: believe.And in his pursuit of the monster, he does what I have been longing for him to do: He whips out his cellphone camera. Unfortunately, hes a Luddite and ends up shooting a video of himself, but its a start.This episode examines the absurdity on which the show is based but also comments on the source of its lasting appeal  the sense of magic imbued by the occasional monster lurking in the woods and by things otherwise not being quite what they seem. On some level, we all want to believe. ...This show (written and directed by Darin Morgan, the author of past comedic episodes, including Clyde Bruckmans Final Repose and Humbug) was seeded with humorous moments, a peeping-tom motel manager who drinks rubbing alcohol right out of the bottle, the droll animal-control officer and a psychiatrist with some quirky advice and a prescription for Mulder.This episode was one for the true believers, and there are Easter eggs throughout: Mulders ringtone is the X-Files theme; Fox Mulder peeks through a fox head mounted on a motel room wall; headstones in the cemetery bear the names of Jack Hardy and Kim Manners, X-Files alumni who have died; Scully mentions Queequeg, the Pomeranian she inherited in Clyde Bruckman; she and Mulder return to the Oregon woods, where the pilot for the show was set; Mulder is back to throwing pencils, this time at an I Want to Believe poster instead of the ceiling. I am sure I missed some, so if you saw one I didnt catch, tell us in the comments section.Despite a dark reputation, The X-Files has let its funny bone show before. Lets take a walk on the lighter side, shall we?Bad Blood (Season 5) An episode that kicks off with Mulder driving a wooden stake through the heart of a vampire pizza boy and continues with Scully and Mulder trying to explain to Skinner how an investigation of a series of nocturnal exsanguinations led to that moment. In Mulders version, the local sheriff (Luke Wilson) is a bucktoothed bonehead, and in Scullys, hes a polite Prince Charming. We also get to see a drugged Mulder singing the Shaft theme song.Small Potatoes (Season 4) A woman delivers a baby with a tail (the fifth in three months in that town) and claims that the child is Luke Skywalkers daughter. The show ends with a shape-shifting suspect, who has turned into Mulder and almost hooked up with Scully, telling Mulder, I was born a loser, but youre one by choice.Humbug (Season 2) This episode doesnt play strictly for laughs, but is an enchanting diversion that lets us live in the world of sideshow performers, including Jim Rose, the leader of the Jim Rose Circus, a modern-day sideshow, who imparts humor and a little wisdom."}

{"text": "DES MOINES  Iowa, widely derided for being unlike the rest of the United States, was supposed to be irrelevant this year as the presidential race became nationalized  thanks to widely viewed televised debates and the rise of social media.But as the Iowa caucuses loom on Monday  the first votes after 1,500 candidate rallies, 60,000 TV ads and a nail-biting tightening of the polls here  the states voters are poised to play perhaps their most significant role ever in both parties nominating contests. And their embrace of candidates on the ideological fringes has amplified a national grass-roots rebellion against establishment politicians.Both Democrats and Republicans have seen their presumptive nominees of a year ago  deeply experienced, proven political leaders  brushed aside by Iowans in favor of idol-smashing outsiders.Theres a tremendous amount of anti-establishment, anti-Washington sentiment here, and I would not be surprised if an outsider on both sides wins, said Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, who has exerted himself in an unheard-of effort to derail one of his own partys front-runners, Senator Ted Cruz.Voters on the ideological edges, who dominate both parties in Iowa, have made Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Donald J. Trump and Mr. Cruz, whose views are anathema to Republican leadership, the standard-bearers of the left and the right.The embrace of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, visible nationally in huge rallies, has stirred Iowas latent Midwest populism, with voters angry about the hollowing out of the middle class, Wall Street greed and the corrupting influence of money in politics. It has created two insurgents who in some ways are opposite sides of the same coin.The policies of President Obama have added accelerant to the fire, with the far left unhappy he did not go far enough, and the right convinced he radically changed the United States.Theres a very disaffected segment of Republican voters and Democratic voters who just want to throw em all out, said David Redlawsk, a political scientist at Rutgers University who wrote a book about the Iowa caucuses. These particular voters have been told for several cycles, All you have to do is vote for me, and it will be 100 percent different. It never is. Sanders and Trump are both benefiting.The results of Mondays caucuses, which will take place in 1,681 precincts across Iowa, ride on such concrete factors as candidates get-out-the-vote efforts  but also on intangibles like voters perception of who is catching fire at the last minute, and even on the weather. Campaigns were anxiously checking forecasts amid reports of a snowstorm arriving late Monday, but expected that the weather would hold enough to encourage turnout, which could give an edge to the two candidates with large support from first-time voters, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders. A victory for Mr. Trump, who has drawn thousands to his rallies here, would devastate Mr. Cruz. The senator has deployed waves of volunteers and sought to visit all 99 counties in Iowa to mobilize evangelical Christians, the core of a conservative coalition that he has built along with Tea Partiers and libertarians.Ninety-three hours, Mr. Cruz said at the end of the Republican debate Thursday in Des Moines. The media noise will soon be over, and its now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.A Trump victory would demonstrate that if the billionaire developers fans, a working-class demographic that is less inclined to vote, can navigate the byzantine caucus process, they are even more likely to turn out in the primary states that follow, where casting a ballot is easier.If Trump wins Iowa, its hard to see how he would not run the table, said Douglas E. Gross, who was the Iowa finance chairman for George W. Bushs re-election bid.On the Democratic side, a victory by Hillary Clinton over a surging Mr. Sanders would banish doubts and set her more firmly on the road to the nomination. But a victory for Mr. Sanders would expose Mrs. Clintons vulnerabilities, uncork another stream of donations for Mr. Sanders and embolden his supporters, including minorities in Southern states that are supposed to be a Clinton firewall.Bernie speaks forcefully to the anxiety that both young people have and the middle class has, said former Senator Tom Harkin, Iowas senior Democrat, who supports Mrs. Clinton like nearly all state party officials who publicly endorsed. Hillary speaks to that, too, but shes not as unique as Bernie Sanders, and in every election some people want the unique, the new, the untried.Mr. Harkin, who in his 30 years in Washington was one of the most left-wing senators, understands well the dynamic in his state, where four in 10 Democrats described themselves in a recent poll as socialist.Among Republicans, more than six in 10 described themselves as devoutly religious in the same poll, for The Des Moines Register.The conditions for a rush to the fringes were already in place a year ago, when Iowans initially embraced both parties presumptive front-runners. Those candidates were long on executive experience in government. For Republicans, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who enacted conservative policies in a blue state, led polls in Iowa for months.Mrs. Clinton held such a commanding lead over her little-known Democratic rivals that Republicans mocked her expected coronation.But the Iowa grass roots, with the opportunity to scrutinize candidates close up and often reflect trends early, had other ideas. When Mr. Sanders visited Iowa in late spring, he drew the largest crowds of any candidate up to that time. The base right now is really hungry for a bold progressive message, Brad Anderson, who had run President Obamas re-election campaign in Iowa, said at the time.His message is unwavering, said Nadene Eller, a retired school librarian in Des Moines, who supports Mr. Sanders even though her union has endorsed Mrs. Clinton. I dont think people know whats going on on the ground here.Mr. Trump, labeling Mexican migrants criminals while promising to deport millions, forced Mr. Walker to the right on immigration at the State Fair in August. Soon Mr. Trump was at the top of the polls, and Mr. Walker dropped out.Appealing to economic and cultural anxieties of white working-class voters, Mr. Trumps proposed ban on Muslim travelers, and his promise that we will be a respected country again, drew ever more supporters. It has mattered little that rivals, backed by millions of dollars in TV ads, expose his history of liberal views. He has defied every pundit prediction that his collapse is imminent after another controversial pronouncement, the latest being his boycott of a Fox News debate. Nor did Iowans blink when, questioning their credulity, he said at a rally in the fall, How stupid are the people of Iowa?Mr. Sanders, calling for a political revolution, embraced a criticism by former President Bill Clinton that he projected too much anger.I am angry, Mr. Sanders said on the campaign trail. The American people are angry.Whereas Mr. Sanders offers a New Deal-style menu of programs (and is sometimes vague on how to pay for them), Mr. Trump is light on policy substance, and his supporters have mainly responded to his stick-it-to-the-man style.Trump is willing to say whatever he believes in whether it offends someone or not because its the truth, said Dakota Anderson, a Walmart worker, who listened raptly while Mr. Trump spoke in Davenport after calling for a ban on Muslims entering the country.The push to the anti-establishment fringe is so strong by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz that candidates appealing to the Republican establishment have been marginalized. Neither Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie nor Gov. John R. Kasich competed hard in the state. Senator Marco Rubio, who made a last-minute push, has seen his support drop in recent days, according to a Des Moines Register poll released on Saturday.The establishment in Iowa this year has gone deep underground, Mr. Gross said. I think Rubio could have won Iowa if he would have really dedicated himself, but in his message he wasnt sure if he was competing against Cruz. If he finishes a strong third, the establishment could coalesce around him, but I would be doubtful he finishes a strong third.On the Democratic side, Mr. Sanderss campaign faces a similar challenge to Mr. Trumps: harnessing the passion of large crowds to get first-time caucusgoers, especially young people, to turn out. Mr. Sanders has built a robust field staff in a short time to mobilize supporters, but his challenge is greater than Mrs. Clintons, who is better organized in Iowa and appeals to more reliable voters.Carol Rivas, a retiree, who in age and gender was typical of attendees at a Clinton rally in West Des Moines last week, said a daughter in California called her daily to press her to switch support to Mr. Sanders from Mrs. Clinton. She has not budged.Bernie says all the right things, what everybody wants to hear, Ms. Rivas said, But I dont know where hed get the money to do it.Stuart Stevens, who was Mitt Romneys top strategist in 2012, predicted a long campaign ahead for both parties because of the disruptive signals likely to emerge on Monday.Were going to look back on Iowa in March and April, and its going to seem like the Crimean War, he said. This thing is just beginning."}

The original caption reads:An Israeli family near the southern town of Ashdod braced for a rocket attack from Gaza on Nov. 18.The photograph previously appeared with this Nov. 18, 2012 article reporting on Iron Dome, Israels unique anti-rocket interceptor system. The article states:In the five days since Israel began its fierce assault on the militant infrastructure in Hamas-run Gaza, after years of rocket fire against southern Israel, Iron Dome has successfully intercepted more than 300 rockets fired at densely populated areas, with a success rate of 80 to 90 percent, top officials said. Developed with significant American financing and undergoing its ultimate battle test, the Iron Dome system has saved many lives, protected property and proved to be a strategic game changer, experts said.A few days later, on Nov. 21, Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire, after a strong push by the U.S. and Egypt. The Times reported:CAIRO  Under intense Egyptian and American pressure, Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas halted eight days of bloody conflict on Wednesday, averting a full-scale Israeli ground invasion of the Gaza Strip without resolving the underlying disputes.With Israeli forces still massed on the Gaza border, a tentative calm descended after the announcement of the agreement. The success of the truce will be an early test of how Egypts new Islamist government might influence the most intractable conflict in the Middle East.The United States, Israel and Hamas all praised Egypts role in brokering the cease-fire as the antagonists pulled back from violence that had killed more than 150 Palestinians and five Israelis over the past week. The deal called for a 24-hour cooling-off period to be followed by talks aimed at resolving at least some of the longstanding grievances between the two sides.Less than two years later, though, in the summer of 2014, fighting between Israel and Hamas intensified into a full-scale war in Gaza.Pavel Wolberg is the photographer."}
{"text": "Calum Ramm, a captain in the Marine Corps, has run many marathons in his day, but last week he set out on a far bigger challenge: running seven marathons on seven continents in just seven days as part of the World Marathon Challenge.  Starting off deep in Antarctica on Jan. 23, he went on to complete marathons in Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco and Dubai before the finale in Sydney, Australia, on Friday. Only 15 athletes took part; those who finished ran 183.4 miles through snow, mountains, tropical heat and city streets.Captain Ramm, from Lansing, Mich., is running to raise money for a charity, the Semper Fi Fund. and is a member of the official Marine Corps running team. Here are some of his thoughts about his experience:Chile was way easier, but the wind was brutal. Almost had me moving backwards at some points. I went out really slow, but dropped some serious splits on the last eight miles. Felt really good upon finishing, almost better than Antarctica. The footing was obviously better so that helped.In Dubai I hit my wall. I thought I may not finish, at least not running. Pounding out so many miles on pavement had beat my feet up pretty bad and I had some serious shin splints  so bad that my whole leg started to swell. I could hardly put weight on it before the race started. By mile eight I was hurting pretty bad. At that point, I decided to shed my sneakers and run barefoot, hoping to reduce the swelling and open up the blood flow. I normally do one training run a week barefoot in grass, and that came in handy at this moment. I crossed the line in under four hours, which was a huge relief. But my race in Australia felt in jeopardy.I knew I had to run Sydney in shoes because it was 13 laps on brick. Plus it was at night and along the beach  so who knew what I might step on. Walking to the start line, the wind was out of control. Not ideal conditions for a bummed leg. But like I had done in Dubai and Morocco, I thought about all the individuals cheering me on and knew I had to just gut it out. I linked up with the other Marine and we pushed through a mile at a time to finish in 3:38 for the final race.It was bittersweet crossing that line. I was happy I didnt have to wake up and throw the running shoes back on. But this incredible life experience was coming to a close. Running has always been so much more than just a hobby for me. It has been a venue to vent my frustrations, clear my head and help sort out lifes challenges. And in this event, the many, many miles spent with nothing but the pavement and my thoughts meant something more: a chance to help troops and veterans in need. Thanks for the support."}

{"text": "To the Editor:Re Groups Opposed to Abortion Join Fights on Frozen Embryos (front page, Jan. 20):Suppose a fire broke out in a fertility clinic and you had to decide to save either 12 embryos in a petri dish or a 3-year-old boy accidentally caught in the fire. Whom would you go to first? If one holds embryos equal to children, you would save the embryos over the little boy because the dish holds 12 children. Is this really what a pro-life advocate would do?Embryos are not children. In fact, while still in the dish, embryos have not yet formed any specialized organ system. In natural procreation the rate of embryo loss is as high as 60 to 80 percent. Millions of embryos go to waste in natural reproduction.The dilemma of embryo custody is reminiscent of the biblical story about King Solomon: Two women claimed to be the mother of one baby. Solomons solution was to cut the baby in half, which resulted in the real mother crying out, Oh Lord, give the baby to her, just dont kill him! However, even King Solomon would have had a hard time doing justice in the case of McQueen vs. Gadberry, since both ex-husband and wife equally share parenthood.The pro-life advocates claim that the embryo has personhood rights, yet this would imply that the embryo, with no life yet breathed into it, has the upper hand over the adult biological father.AVNER HERSHLAGManhasset, N.Y.The writer, an obstetrician, is chief of the North Shore-L.I.J.

{"text": "At the beginning of this year, we quietly expanded TimesMachine, our virtual microfilm reader, to include every issue of The New York Times published between 1981 and 2002. Prior to this expansion, TimesMachine contained every issue published between 1851 and 1980, which consisted of over 11 million articles spread out over approximately 2.5 million pages. The new expansion adds an additional 8,035 complete issues containing 1.4 million articles over 1.6 million pages.Creating and expanding TimesMachine presented us with several interesting technical challenges, and in this post well describe how we tackled two. First, well discuss the fundamental challenge with TimesMachine: efficiently providing a user with a scan of an entire days newspaper without requiring the download of hundreds of megabytes of data.  Then, well discuss a fascinating string matching problem we had to solve in order to include articles published after 1980 in TimesMachine.Before TimesMachine was launched in 2014, articles from the archive were searchable and available to subscribers only as PDF documents. While the archive was accessible, two major problems in implementation remained: context and user experience.Isolating an article from the surrounding content removes the context in which it was published. A modern reader might discover that on July 20, 1969, a man named John Fairfax became the first man to row across the Atlantic Ocean. However, a reader absorbed in The New York Times that morning might have been considerably more impressed by the front page news that Apollo 11, whose crew contained Neil Armstrong, had just swung into orbit around the moon in preparation for the first moon landing. Knowing where that John Fairfax article was published in the paper (bottom left of the front page) as well as what else was going on that day is much more interesting and valuable to a historian than an article on its own without the context of other news of the day.We wanted to present the archive in all its glory as it was meant to be consumed on the day it was printed  one issue at a time. Our goal was to create a fluid viewing experience, not to force users to slowly download high resolution images. Heres how we did that.Our digitized print archive is big, containing terabytes of high-resolution page scans. Even for a single issue, the storage requirements are appreciable. The May 22, 1927 issue announcing the success of Charles Lindberghs pioneering trans-Atlantic flight consists of 226 pages which require nearly 200 megabytes of storage. When we built TimesMachine, we knew that there was no way we could expect users to sit through multi-hundred-megabyte downloads in order to browse a single issue. We needed a way to load just the parts of an issue that a user is looking at. We found an answer from a somewhat unexpected quarter and now, when you load that 200 megabyte Lindbergh issue in your browser, the initial page load requires the transmission of just a couple of megabytes.We achieve this by using mapping software to display each issue. Like the pages of a scanned newspaper, a digital map is just a really big image. The technique most often used to display digital maps (and the same technique we employ for TimesMachine) is image tiling. With image tiling, a large image is broken down into a myriad of small square images, or tiles, computed at a variety of zoom levels.Clever software then runs in the browser and loads only those tiles that correspond to the region of the image the user wants to see. Numerous open source software libraries have been created to make and display such tiles (we used GDAL for tile generation and leaflet.js for display). All we had to do was adapt these libraries to show you a newspaper. To do this we created a processing pipeline called The TimesMachine Publisher. Heres how it works.For a given issue, the pipeline takes in three inputs: high-resolution scans of pages from microfilm, XML files of article metadata, and INI files describing the geometric boundaries of every article on every page. The pipeline first stitches the pages together into one large virtual image. The coordinates of every article on every page are then projected from cartesian (x, y) coordinates into geographic (latitude and longitude) coordinates. These projected coordinates are combined with article metadata into a large JavaScript object describing the contents of a complete issue. The large virtual image is then cut up into thousands of 256256 pixel tiles computed at several zoom levels. All of this data is uploaded to a content distribution network (CDN).Whenever a user requests a days paper in TimesMachine, the client- side software downloads the JSON object describing the papers contents and requests only those tiles necessary to display the portion of the paper that fits into the users viewport. Additional data is loaded only when the user pans or zooms. Using this approach, TimesMachine delivers any days newspaper to the client quickly and efficiently.We encountered a fascinating issue in our attempt to expand the number of issues in TimesMachine. Initially, TimesMachine contained only those articles published between 1851 and 1980. The exclusion of data from after 1980 stems from an interesting historic quirk of our archive. Starting around 1981, The Times began keeping an archive of the complete digital text of every article published in print. In order to expand TimesMachine beyond 1980 and include links to the full text, we needed to know how our scanned print archive and our digital text archive aligned. Here is how we figured this out.The first step was to run optical character recognition (OCR) on articles in the scanned print archive to transcribe the text as cleanly as possible. We used tesseract-ocr for this.Heres an example of some nicely-OCRed text:After doing this for every article in a single days issue, we ended up with a bucket of scanned print articles OCRed with tesseract, and a bucket of articles from the full text archive. We then had to figure out which articles matched up between these two buckets, which was an interesting process.Because an OCRed article is seldom an exact match for its full text counterpart, we could not align articles by simply testing for string equality. Instead, we used fuzzy string matching. Our approach was applied one issue at a time and relied on a technique known as shingling. Using shingling, we transformed the text of articles in both datasets into a list of tokens, and then turned the list of tokens into a list of n-token sequences called shingles.Well illustrate with this quote by Abraham Lincoln:This is our full text. We tokenize it by splitting it into a list of words separated by spaces. The string secret is considered a token in the full text.Now we convert the list of tokens into a list of shingles, which are sequences of tokens. If we use a shingle size of 4, we end up with the following: 5 lists of tokens. (As you can see, the contents of the lists overlap like shingles on a roof.)When we generate the list of shingles for every article in the full text digital archive, we get something that looks like this:It is a reasonable hypothesis that sequences of words from an OCRed article will overlap a fair amount with sequences of words in that same article in the full text archive. We want a list of articles that contain each shingle so we can narrow down our options. Iterating through the above list, we can transform our data into the following hash table:Now that we have a mapping of all the shingles appearing in a given issue to all the full text articles from that issue containing each shingle, we repeat the first part of the process with the OCRed text, getting a list of shingles for each article.Lets say OCRed article_A consists of shingle_2 and shingle_5. We can use the table above to generate a list of article candidates that might be a match with article_A. By looking up shingle_2 and shingle_5 in the table, we conclude that article_1, article_2, article_2 and article_5 are all potential matches for article_A.This greatly reduces the problem space. Now, instead of having to compare every OCRed article in an issue to every full text article in an issue, which could involve tens of thousands of computationally expensive comparisons, we need only compare a short list. This ends up reducing the number of comparisons by several orders of magnitude.To quantify the difference between the OCRed data and the full text articles, we used the Python difflib library. It gave us a nice, clean result:From this particular example, it is clear that OCRed article_A is most likely the same article as full text article_1.Using this process, we could match approximately 80 percent of the articles. The remaining 20 percent did not have clear enough distinctions in scores, which required us to be a little more clever. In a perfect world, the relationship between our two buckets of articles would have been one-to-one, but in this world, it was actually many-to-many. Some full text articles were represented as multiple regions in the scanned archive, and some single regions in the scanned archive corresponded to multiple items in the full text archive. We reconciled the disparity by splitting the data into paragraphs and carrying out a similar process to the one described above, on the paragraph level.We ended up with a near-perfect, many-to-many matching of zones to the full text archive which is wonderfully searchable.

{"text": "Donald Trump, to borrow his own word, is unbelievable.At around 2:30 on Monday afternoon, at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Donald Trump was loudly, confidently and repeatedly proclaiming his impending victory in Iowa. Just before 10 p.m., he was acting like he had never expected to win, and like coming in second was a YUGE accomplishment.I absolutely love the people of Iowa, Mr. Trump said at his campaign headquarters. Unbelievable.Mr. Trump said that when he declared his candidacy in June, I was told by everybody, do not go to Iowa, you could never finish even in the top 10.I said I have to do it, he said. And we finished second and I want to tell you something, Im just honored.Mr. Trump congratulated the victor, Ted Cruz, for winning and Mike Huckabee for quitting and never mentioned Marco Rubio, who was coming in a very close third on Monday night and should be a focus of Mr. Trumps attention.Its impossible to know whether Mr. Trump understands that his slack campaign organization in Iowa may have cost him dearly here. Kenneth P. Vogel of Politico said Mr. Trump spent almost as much on hats as he did on payroll.Ever optimistic, Mr. Trump said he was on to New Hampshire, where he  of course  promised a big victory.Iowas caucuses are nothing like New Hampshires primary, of course, but I wonder if well see fewer Trump hats and more Trump volunteers and TV ads in New Hampshire."}

{"text": "Two Virginia Tech students were arrested over the weekend in connection with the abduction and death of a 13-year-old girl whose remains were found on Saturday, school and law enforcement officials said.Natalie M. Keepers, 19, was arrested Sunday and charged with improper disposal of a body and accessory after the fact in the commission of a felony, said the police in Blacksburg, Va., the location of Virginia Tech. Ms. Keepers, a sophomore engineering student from Laurel, Md., was being held without bond at the Montgomery County, Va., jail, the police said.The police said Ms. Keepers had helped dispose of the body of the girl, Nicole Madison Lovell, who disappeared from her home in Blacksburg on Wednesday. The girls remains were discovered on Saturday off Route 89 in Surry County, N.C., about 100 miles from Blacksburg and just over the Virginia border, according to the police. The medical examiner in Roanoke, Va., was conducting an autopsy on Sunday.The investigation had led authorities to another student on Friday. The police said the student, David Eisenhauer, 18, was arrested at his dormitory the next day and charged with abduction and murder. Mr. Eisenhauer, a freshman engineering student from Columbia, Md., was also being held without bond at the Montgomery County jail, officials said.Based on the evidence collected to date, investigators have determined that Eisenhauer and Nicole were acquainted prior to her disappearance, the police said in a statement.Investigators were trying to reconstruct the timeline of events leading to Nicoles death and were looking for a motive, the Blacksburg police chief, Anthony Wilson, said. They were also trying to figure out the nature of the relationship between the victim and Mr. Eisenhauer.Ms. Keepers attended Hammond High School, also in Columbia, where she was active in theater, according to her Facebook profile.A missing person flier that was circulated on social media after Nicoles disappearance described a scar on her neck from a tracheotomy and said she had required medication after receiving a liver transplant.Mr. Eisenhauer, a cross-country runner, was named the Howard County Times/Columbia Flier boys indoor track athlete of the year in 2015 after finishing third in a county invitational, according to a profile in The Baltimore Sun. He graduated from Wilde Lake High School in Columbia after moving from Yakima, Wash., and winning two races at the Maryland state championships, according to the article.Officials at Virginia Tech said in a statement that the school would assist the law enforcement investigation in any way it can. In an open letter to the campus on Saturday, the universitys president, Tim Sands, said that the case has everyone in a state of shock and sadness, and that our hearts go out to Nicoles family and friends."}
{"text": "The biggest stories of this young political year are the surprising surges of the outsider presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic senator from Vermont. Close behind is the possible collapse of the once-formidable front-runner, Jeb Bush.Only a year ago, the Washington cognoscenti, the less politically sophisticated big donors and the London oddsmakers all figured that the son and brother of presidents was a solid favorite to clinch the Republican nomination. Six months ago, Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida, thought that he had a real shot at winning Iowa, the first nominating contest. But as the states voters prepare to gather for the traditional caucuses on Monday night, he barely registers in the polls.There is already a debate in Republican circles over what went wrong: Was he just a bad candidate? Was he ill served by the chief strategist of the richly funded Bush super PAC? Or was this just a bad year for any establishment figure?In the first half of 2015, when Mr. Bush could have dominated the agenda, his campaign essentially had one message: financial shock and awe, with more money than anyone ever. Little effort went into defining the candidate, or reminding voters that Mr. Bush, who had been out of office for almost a decade, was a conservative reform governor. Policy expertise, including that from influential social right leaders, was brushed aside.The campaign then decided that the super PAC, Right to Rise, run by Mr. Bushs longtime confidant Mike Murphy, would be the prime player. The PAC has spent $70 million on broadcast, cable and radio advertising, almost 30 percent of the total spent by all Republican and Democratic candidates and their political action committees.The returns, the numbers suggest, have been minimal. Even ads that created buzz  attacks on Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that poked fun at his fancy boots or pointed out his flip-flopping on issues  didnt help Mr. Bush or hurt their target.They did create bitterness among establishment Republicans, who complained, privately, that while Mr. Bush insisted that he was the only one who was taking on the front-runner, Mr. Trump, Mr. Murphy was going after Mr. Rubio.The tension with Mr. Rubio, who had been a Bush protg, also illustrated Mr. Bushs weakness as a candidate. In an early debate, he sought to attack Mr. Rubios spotty attendance in the Senate. Mr. Rubio turned the attack back on a flat-footed Mr. Bush.Mr. Bush also stumbled over whether he would have supported the ill-fated war in Iraq waged by his brother, President George W. Bush. He should have anticipated this potential pitfall, but he was never able to effectively deal with the legacy of his brother, who some top Iowa Republicans say is a big albatross in their state. (The Bush camp hopes that wont be the case elsewhere. They are reportedly planning to have the 43rd president campaign for his younger sibling in South Carolina.)But Jeb Bush suffered most from being savaged by Mr. Trump, the billionaire developer, who derided him, insulted his family ties and mocked him with the lasting epithet that he was low energy.Mr. Bush has improved as a candidate. In Iowa last week, he was more substantive than most of his rivals on domestic issues and national security. But when he riffs on topics such as Civil Service reform, the Trump shot echoes.In the Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll released on Saturday, Mr. Bush is in a four-way tie for seventh place with 2 percent, and has the highest negatives of any Republican candidate.If his showing in the caucuses is no better than what the polling predicts, he would need a strong showing in New Hampshire next week against the other establishment candidates in order to retain a plausible path to the nomination.In the debates and on the campaign trail, Mr. Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have exhibited a depth on policy and government experience that in a more normal campaign cycle might have allowed them to stand out.But right now they can only hope that the polls have been misconstruing the appetite of Republican primary voters for something very different from what they have to offer."}
{"text": "The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra opened its first set at the Village Vanguard on a recent Monday night with a familiar blend of purring saxophones and punchy brass, carving up Big Dipper just as it had in its first performance in the same room almost exactly 50 years ago.That debut, on Feb. 7, 1966, initiated a residency with no close equivalent in jazz, and few parallels in any creative field. The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra has been a Monday-night fixture in the club ever since, carrying on the legacy of its founder, the trumpeter and composer Thad Jones, and his co-leader, the drummer Mel Lewis. Hearing the band in its natural habitat, on any given Monday, has long been an essential New York experience.I used to go down and hear that band, oh my gosh, almost every Monday night, said the composer Maria Schneider, referring to her early days in New York, in the mid-80s, before she formed her own orchestra. Just to take in the exuberant sound of that music in that room.This week the Vanguard band celebrates its 50th anniversary with an extended engagement, Monday through Feb. 8. And the historical echoes in the club should ring even more clearly than usual, owing to the forthcoming release of All My Yesterdays: The Debut 1966 Recordings at the Village Vanguard, a revelatory two-disc set documenting the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra, as it was known for its first dozen years, at a moment of explosive arrival.The album, out on Feb. 19, will be the first sanctioned release of this material, featuring revered figures like Bob Brookmeyer on valve trombone and Hank Jones, Thads older brother, on piano. An extensive booklet has interviews with all seven surviving musicians from the sessions, including the alto saxophonist Jerry Dodgion, the trumpeter Jimmy Owens and the bassist Richard Davis. The music sounds marvelous, supercharged with jocular flair and soulful fire.It was recorded in the club to two-track tape by George Klabin, at the time a sophomore at Columbia University and head of the jazz department at WKCR-FM, the university station. Among the two evenings of material, one is from that opening night, Feb. 7. I had listened to a lot of jazz, said Mr. Klabin, who is releasing the album on his label, Resonance, and I had never heard anything like this.Mr. Jones was far from a novice when he started the orchestra, initially as a rehearsal band of his peers, jazz musicians who were also first-call session players in New York. They convened after hours, to accommodate their schedule of Broadway, television and commercial work, playing charts that Mr. Jones had written for the Count Basie Orchestra. (Those charts, including Big Dipper, had been rejected by Basie as a poor fit for his more traditional band.)The grounding, of course, is in the Basie style, said Darcy James Argue, whose contemporary big band, Secret Society, is recording its third album this week. Theres a real swing feeling to that, but the harmonic vocabulary is completely modern. The level of sophistication and ingenuity of the reharmonization that he used is still a constant source of inspiration.The band also relied on the subtle, sensitive power of Mr. Lewiss drumming. The whole tradition, honestly, was built around how Mel played drums, Ms. Schneider said. He was so relaxed, and everything seemed so effortless. I remember thinking, He looks like my dad in the fishing boat. It wasnt that he played a lot of flash and fills; he was laying everything just in the right spot.Max Gordon, the owner of the Village Vanguard, hired the band for a few Mondays, a night when the club was usually dark. From the first night, which was enthusiastically reviewed in The New York Times, the bands potential was blazingly clear. Soon the Monday big-band residency had become its own custom: Gil Evans held one for a while, as did Ms. Schneider. (The Mingus Big Band now appears on Mondays at the Jazz Standard.) Over the years, there have been stretches when Monday is the Vanguards most reliable night in terms of attendance.Any institution learns to adapt, and the Vanguard band has survived not only an evolving roster  the saxophonist Joe Lovano is among its distinguished alumni  but also several changes in leadership. Mr. Jones decamped in the late 70s, moving to Copenhagen to lead the Danish Radio Big Band. For roughly the next decade, it was the Mel Lewis Orchestra.When Mr. Lewis died in 1990, it became the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, playing its trusted repertory as well as ambitious new works by Mr. Brookmeyer, Jim McNeely and others. In 2011, the death of Mr. Brookmeyer had another profound effect on the band, which released its most recent album, Overtime: Music of Bob Brookmeyer (Planet Arts), to worthy acclaim in 2014.The trombonist John Mosca, who just celebrated his 40th anniversary with the band, is now its director. And the bass trombonist Douglas Purviance, whose tenure stretches back almost as long, is its manager. During a conversation between sets in the Vanguard office, they characterized their stewardship of the orchestra as a matter of respect for its founding fathers.I just remember the spirit of Thad, Mr. Purviance said, and you can hear it on the new record. I think we play the music very, very, very well. But the only thing that I really miss is that spirit that Thad Jones had in front of the band.Those guys are irreplaceable, Mr. Mosca said. It took me years to learn not to look for Mel and to see how the music could progress with the new guys. And when Thad left, it was like Oh my God, its the end of the world. But it wasnt. Thats the great thing about this music. It doesnt end.Mr. Purviance nodded. Maybe you heard it here 10 years ago, he said. Maybe you heard it two years ago. Its still worth coming down to hear how this music has survived  and has grown."}

{"text": "Mrinalini Sarabhai, an Indian dancer and choreographer who brought ancient South Indian dance forms into the 20th century and infused her work with social commentary, died on Jan. 21 at her home in Ahmedabad, in western India. She was 97.The cause was complications of a stomach infection, her son, Kartikeya, said.Ms. Sarabhai was one of the first women to perform Kathakali, a classical dance form based on Hindu epics that was usually performed by all-male troupes in elaborate makeup and costumes. She was also among a group of contemporaries who introduced wider audiences to Bharatanatyam, a dance form that had traditionally been presented in temples by women who were promised to Hindu gods.As a choreographer, Ms. Sarabhai often deviated from the typical subjects of classical dance to tackle injustice.For example, Memory Is a Ragged Fragment of Eternity, a Bharatanatyam dance, depicts a young bride driven to suicide. Ms. Sarabhais inspiration came from reading newspaper reports of young women dying of burns and learning that these were often cases of dowry death: a phenomenon in which women were abused and sometimes killed or driven to suicide by their husbands for not providing enough dowry.In the 1970s she created Ranmalpur, a short piece based on the killing of five Dalits, or untouchables, in Gujarat. Her 1979 piece Aspirations was inspired by the resistance to a dam proposed in Kerala, which environmentalists said would destroy a forest there. She later performed it in front of delegates to a conference on conservation in New Delhi at the behest of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, her son said. The dam was never built.I was always looking for subjects that would shake people in dance, she said in Mrinalini Sarabhai: The Artist and Her Art, a 2012 film directed by Yadavan Chandran and Ms. Sarabhais daughter, Mallika Sarabhai, who is also a prominent dancer.Ms. Sarabhai was born Mrinalini Swaminadhan in the South Indian city of Chennai, then called Madras, on May 11, 1918. Her father was a prominent lawyer, her mother a social activist and later a member of Parliament.Her sister, Lakshmi Sahgal, was, like their mother, active in the struggle for Indian independence, and served as a captain in the Indian National Army, formed by the Bengali freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose.Ms. Sarabhai studied in Switzerland and at a school run by the Nobel Prize-winning Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore in Shantiniketan, in present-day West Bengal. She learned classical dance from various instructors.She married Vikram Sarabhai, a physicist regarded as the father of Indias space program, in 1942, and later moved with him to Ahmedabad, in the state of Gujarat. He died in 1971.In 1949 she and her husband founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts in Ahmedabad; it is now run by their daughter. In addition to her daughter and her son, an environmentalist, Ms. Sarabhai is survived by four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Ms. Sarabhai, who performed all over the world (her Darpana company made its New York debut in 1972), achieved renown for bringing innovation to ancient traditions. One of her first major successes was the dance drama Manushya, in which she stripped Kathakali dancers of their makeup and costumes so that audiences could focus on the beauty of the movement. She took that dance to Paris in 1949 for her first major international performance.But it is perhaps in the city of Ahmedabad where her legacy, mingled with her husbands, is most deeply felt. Their union, said Amrita Shah, a journalist who wrote a book on Vikram Sarabhai and a book on the city, was the marriage of two innovators in distinct fields.In a sense they represented the aspiration of newly independent India of that time, Ms. Shah said. It was a time of building. It was a time of understanding what this new country was going to be."}
{"text": "After St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Lower Manhattan was destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, by the collapse of the World Trade Center nearby, the Rev. John D. Romas held his small congregation together as its worship services moved to Brooklyn and instilled in his parishioners the hope that they would live to see their church rebuilt. He, however, did not.Father Romas died of pancreatic cancer on Jan. 24, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of New York announced. He was 86.Construction of the new St. Nicholas National Shrine did not begin until last fall, at a site overlooking the National September 11 Memorial from an elevated park. It has been designed by Santiago Calatrava to evoke the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Its translucent marble walls will glow at night. Archbishop Demetrios, the primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in America, has called it a place of pilgrimage for our nation.It will be, in short, a far cry from the parochial church Mr. Romas joined in 1972, more than a decade before his ordination, when the first trade center was under construction. St. Nicholas was a remnant of a once-vibrant Greek community. Until 2001, the church was best known for sponsoring a celebration of the Epiphany each January, during which divers competed to retrieve a cross from the Hudson River.Parishioners worshiped on the ground floor of a modest four-story building at 155 Cedar Street. On the exterior, about the only indication of any religious function was a small bell cote at the parapet.Father Romas said he felt predestined to lead St. Nicholas. His father, Demetrios Rampaounis, a flour miller, encouraged him as a boy to tend the church of St. Nicholas in Dorvitsia, Greece, where he grew up. He was born on April 10, 1929, and emigrated to the United States in 1952. That year he married Lorraine Papachristou, who survives him.He was ordained in 1984. In 1987, Archbishop Iakovos appointed him the pastor of St. Nicholas Church downtown  a spiritual retreat for office workers on weekdays and a parish church on Sundays for about 40 to 50 worshipers who commuted to Lower Manhattan from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, New Jersey and Westchester County.No one was in the church on the Tuesday morning in 2001 when the terrorist attack occurred. The building was compressed into a pile of rubble about two feet high by the debris falling from 2 World Trade Center. I was crying like a baby, Father Romas recalled.He managed to extract some remnants from the ruins, including part of the wooden kouvouklion, a bier representing the tomb of Jesus that figures in Good Friday services, together with an icon called the epitaphios, showing Jesus after being taken down from the cross.Its a very symbolic and important piece of a church, said Peter Drakoulias, a former board member of St. Nicholas, who combed the wreckage with Father Romas, so finding it, or at least a piece of it, was almost miraculous when you think of the devastation that occurred.Father Romas did not give up the hope of re-establishing the parish, whose members he served after 2001 at SS. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Brooklyn, where a number of them continue to worship. At times he was the public face of the broader redevelopment effort.The archdiocese said he anxiously awaited the completion of his beloved St. Nicholas.Housed within the shrine will be a new kouvouklion  dedicated to Father Romas."}
{"text": "GENEVA  As a suicide attack killed more than 40 people near a revered shrine in Syria on Sunday and government forces pummeled a besieged town, peace talks inched forward in Geneva, where a reluctant opposition delegation met for the first time with a United Nations mediator.With that step, opposition delegates signaled new, if tenuous, hope that the Geneva talks could bring a modicum of progress on their immediate demands: an end to starvation sieges and indiscriminate bombings, and the release of prisoners.There were signs that the Syrian government and opposition were exploring avenues for progress on those issues, even as the violence around the Syrian capital, Damascus, served as a reminder of the powerful forces opposing any compromise.The extremist Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the suicide attack, south of Damascus near the Sayeda Zeinab shrine, a beloved place of worship, a haven for displaced Syrians and a crucial symbol that leaders have used to motivate pro-government Shiite militias. The government also signaled a hard line with a heavy barrage of barrel bombs on the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Moadhamiyeh, already troubled by a rising number of malnutrition cases.Doctors in Moadhamiyeh reported seeing 97 patients with symptoms of suffocation, and while the doctors did not have equipment to test for toxins, they said they had not seen so many cases since the chemical attacks of 2013. The United States and its allies blamed those attacks on the government, which denied responsibility.But in Geneva, opposition delegates were compiling a list of 3,800 prisoners for possible discussions about an exchange, and proposing to their allies that they unilaterally lift a siege on two government-held towns. In Madaya, a rebel-held town besieged by the government, residents said lists of the sick and wounded were being drawn up in case evacuations were made possible under a deal.An opposition spokesman hinted Sunday night that if there was even a small measure of tangible progress on the humanitarian issues, the delegation might agree to discuss the broader issues of ending the war in talks with the United Nations mediator for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.We hope that he will do something to make things easier to start negotiations, the spokesman, Salem al-Meslet, said Sunday after representatives met with Mr. de Mistura briefly in their Geneva hotel. We hope we see something tomorrow.The opposition has refused to take part in any formal negotiations until those measures  mandated by United Nations Security Council resolutions  are carried out, and it demanded assurances before meeting with Mr. de Mistura.But now, both delegations are scheduled to meet with him on Monday, the government in the morning and the opposition in the late afternoon. The talks, at this initial stage, were never meant to be face to face; the plan is for the mediator to shuttle between the parties. Despite the efforts, made under heavy pressure from the United States and Russia to move ahead, the attacks outside Damascus were reminders of the difficulty of ending the five-year war.The attack on the Sayeda Zeinab shrine appeared designed to remind the government and its allies, including Iran and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, that despite gains on the battlefield with the help of Russian air power, they remain vulnerable even in tightly held government territory and in places of extreme symbolic significance.The attack was also part and parcel of the effort by the Sunni-led Islamic State to intensify the sectarian aspect of the conflict. The group emphasized that by using slurs for Shiites, whom it considers apostates, in its statements claiming responsibility.The Sayeda Zeinab shrine, in what was once a busy market area, has been an important symbol that has helped motivate Shiite militia recruits from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan fighting in Syria on the side of the government, with their leaders exhorting them to defend the shrine.The town has become a foothold for Hezbollah and other Shiite militias assisting the government in fighting insurgents in the Damascus suburbs, but it also houses civilians displaced from Shiite towns in northern Syria.The town was once a symbol of coexistence, mostly Sunni and centered on a shrine holy to all Muslims but especially to Shiites. The shrine honors the early Islamic figure Zeinab, a granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad who lost her brothers and sons in battle and was taken to Damascus as a prisoner. She has long been honored, particularly by Shiites, as a symbol of sacrifice and steadfastness.Fighting has reached there before, in the form of insurgent mortar attacks and government bombardments, but the bombing on Sunday appeared to be one of the largest to hit the area.In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry made a public appeal on Sunday, asking all sides to seize the opportunity for serious negotiations to end the conflict, saying that the diplomatic effort had reached a pivotal stage.While battlefield dynamics can affect negotiating leverage, in the end there is no military solution to this conflict, Mr. Kerry said in remarks streamed on the State Departments website.Without negotiations, the bloodshed will drag on until the last city is reduced to rubble and virtually every home, every form of infrastructure, and every semblance of civilization is destroyed, he said. And that will ensure an increased number of terrorists created by, and attracted to, this fight. This conflict could easily engulf the region if left to spiral completely out of control.Mr. Kerry once again denounced the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying it was by far the primary source of killing, torture and deprivation in this war, but his appeal also seemed focused on getting the opposition to the table.Mr. Kerry has been an important broker pushing for the talks, along with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. The two men spoke by telephone on Saturday as momentum stalled.According to the official Russian news agency TASS, the diplomats agreed at the initial stage of the negotiations all sides must concentrate on settling humanitarian issues, like delivering aid to besieged areas, and only then get to political reforms and elections.That was a new signal that Russia had agreed to begin with humanitarian measures, as the opposition has demanded.Diplomats and analysts said the talks would have to make swift progress to keep the sides coming to the table.Salman Sheikh, a former United Nations diplomat in close touch with the opposition, said that whether these talks made any progress depended on how hard Russia and the United States pushed to carry out the humanitarian measures they had endorsed in the Security Council.These guys came on assurances, he said of the opposition. Theyre looking for practical steps.For its part, the opposition is prepared to make a unilateral concession, Mr. Meslet said. He said the delegation had proposed that insurgents lift their siege on the northern Syrian government-held towns of Fouaa and Kfarya, just to prove that we are clean and serious.But he had not yet presented that idea to Mr. de Mistura, he said. In one of many obstacles to the talks, the opposition delegation, the High Negotiations Committee, has ties to some, but not all, of the fighters on the ground. The opposition delegates had sent their suggestion to Syria, and were waiting to hear if commanders on the front lines would agree."}
{"text": "WATERLOO, Iowa  Bernie Sanders held a rock concert rally in Iowa this weekend, which seemed both fitting and unnecessary for a candidate whose every speech features cheering fans shouting requests for his greatest hits.Big banks! Fifteen bucks an hour! Medicare for all! And, from a fan in Cedar Rapids: Jane! anticipating Mr. Sanderss stump-speech salute to his wife of 27 years, a loving mention that draws a collective aw.Mr. Sanderss call for revolution against a political and financial system rigged against the middle class is whats powered him to a dead heat with Hillary Clinton. As he pledges to battle the establishment, hes also hoping to buck a hard reality: Americans aged 18 to 24 are the most unreliable voters in the electorate, with participation thats fallen from 51 percent in 1964, to 38 percent in 2012. Even in 2008, Barack Obamas historic candidacy brought only 44 percent of this group to the polls.Mr. Sanderss appeal to young people earned him imitation by his Democratic rivals, as well as the criticism that he is a one-note candidate short on workable solutions. For his young fans, the unchanging nature of his pitch has deepened their connection to him. His rallies feel like a combination revival meeting and rock musical festival, down to the funky vendors hawking rainbow-hued Feel the Bern merchandise.Sunday at the Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center in Waterloo, Krissy Haglund, a doctor whose student debt tops $3,800 a month, had road-tripped from Minneapolis with her two young children to join in the movement. While Mr. Sanders spoke, Ms. Haglund made a handmade sign reading Student Loan Reform on a pizza box, then jumped up and down waving it until Mr. Sanders noticed. Yes, the young lady there, well get to that in a minute.Alongside Dr. Haglund, young people in college sweatshirts, a man with lots of piercings and a Sanders cap, a woman with a baby in a cloth sling, and a middle-aged couple called out zero! when he asked what the financing rate on an education should be. Many hands go up when Mr. Sanders asks who has student loans. When he ticks off the sins of big banks, the crowd boos. On Saturday night in Cedar Rapids, as he introduced another international embarrassment that must be stopped, somebody shouted Trump! and the place went crazy. Even when he expounds on something as potentially boring as offshore tax havens, people listen, which surprises him.In a new Quinnipiac poll released Monday, Mr. Sanders was favored by a whopping 74 percent among 18 to 44 year-olds, compared with 23 percent for Hillary Clinton.Mrs. Clintons speeches have gotten hotter, but she doesnt receive that level of interaction in her rallies here. She speaks from a stage thats elevated from the crowd, flanked by Secret Service agents, her staff and barricades so dense that when an elderly woman felt faint during a Cedar Rapids rally on Saturday, it took three men 15 minutes to remove the security fences for her to exit. Mrs. Clintons rally Sunday in Des Moines was ebullient, as friends hugged one another and swayed to piped-in Katy Perry. The crowd was older and more female, and while they might be less hip and more staid, they are among the nations most dependable primary voters.The enthusiasm for revolution that greets Mr. Sanders, the Democratic Socialist from Vermont feels similar in some ways to that for Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas congressman who polled about 6 percent in the 2008 Republican primaries. Mr. Sanders hopes that his emotional appeal to the economic pain felt by the young will propel them to participate at the rates they did in 2008, or higher. When turnout is low, he warns them, Republicans win. His fans are true believers, but whether their faith translates into action is the big question mark hanging over every packed, whooping rally."}
{"text": "Dr. Herbert L. Abrams, a radiologist at Stanford and Harvard universities and a founder of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 for its work in publicizing the health consequences of atomic warfare, died on Jan. 20 at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 95.The death was confirmed by his son, John.In the late 1970s, Dr. Abrams became interested in the health implications of nuclear policy. It began to dawn on me that these weapons of annihilation were being considered for use in the settlement of disputes between nations when I had honestly not thought that that was ever in the cards, he told The Los Angeles Times in 1989.With a group of American and Soviet doctors, he helped create International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, with the goal of publicizing the health risks of a nuclear exchange and countering theories that physicians might be able to save enough people to continue civilized life. He later called nuclear weapons and nuclear war the central health issue of the 20th century.Dr. Abrams served as founding vice president of the group, which was awarded the Unesco Prize for Peace Education in 1984 and the Nobel Peace Prize a year later. In announcing the award, the Nobel committee said the group had performed an important service by spreading authoritative information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare.Herbert Leroy Abrams was born on Aug. 16, 1920, in Brooklyn and grew up in Sheepshead Bay. His father, Morris, was an immigrant from Russia and ran a successful company that produced machinery and factory tools. His mother, the former Freda Sugarman, was also an immigrant from Russia.After graduating from James Madison High School, he received a bachelors degree from Cornell in 1941. He earned a medical degree from Long Island Medical College (now the SUNY Downstate Medical Center) and completed his residency in internal medicine at Long Island College Hospital and Montefiore Hospital.He completed a residency in radiology at Stanford Universitys school of medicine in 1952 and two years later joined the faculty, eventually becoming the schools director of diagnostic radiology.An expert on cardiovascular radiology, Dr. Abrams published nearly 200 papers and wrote seven books on cardiovascular disease and health policy. His book Angiography (1961), the first comprehensive volume on the subject, is now, under the editorship of Stanley Baum, in its fourth edition under the title Abrams Angiography: Vascular and Interventional Radiology.For many years Dr. Abrams was editor in chief of the journal Postgraduate Radiology. He was the founding editor in chief of the journal Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology. In 1967 he accepted a position as a professor and chairman of radiology at Harvard Medical School.Dr. Abrams returned to Stanford as a professor of radiology in 1985 but spent most of his time doing research at the universitys Center for International Security and Cooperation. He was also a senior fellow at Stanfords Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, and a director for many years of Physicians for Social Responsibility.In addition to his son, Dr. Abrams, who also lived on Marthas Vineyard, is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Spitz; a daughter, Nancy Abrams; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His older brother, Mason Adams, played Charlie Hume, the managing editor of the newspaper that was the setting of the television series Lou Grant, starring Ed Asner. Mr. Adams died in 2005.In the 1990s, Dr. Abrams began to focus on medical issues involving the American presidency and executive decision making. That interest led him to write The President Has Been Shot: Confusion, Disability, and the 25th Amendment in the Aftermath of the Attempted Assassination of Ronald Reagan (1992)."}
{"text": "King Charles III, the critically acclaimed future history play imagining the British monarchy after Queen Elizabeth II, enjoyed its strongest week on Broadway before ending its run on Sunday.The new play, written by Mike Bartlett and starring Tim Pigott-Smith, grossed $732,328 for eight performances in the week ending Jan. 31, according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League. That was the most it made in any week since beginning previews on Oct. 10; in all, the show ran for 22 previews and 103 regular performances.China Doll, a new play written by David Mamet and starring Al Pacino, also closed Sunday; critics were hostile, but the show started strongly at the box office, and recouped its investment costs despite a drop in grosses in January. In the plays final week, it grossed $658,216 for seven performances. China Doll, which began previews on Oct. 21, ran for 40 previews and 54 regular performances.Over all, Broadway largely bounced back last week, after the previous week was interrupted by a blizzard that prompted the cancellation of Saturday shows.Hamilton, a new musical about Alexander Hamilton, continued to strengthen its already commanding position in the commercial theater market. For the third week in a row, the show was the highest grossing on Broadway, surpassing the long-running industry leaders, The Lion King and Wicked. The show, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, also had the highest average paid admission, of $161.21 (thats what the theater sold the average ticket for  many audience members are paying much higher prices to buy resold tickets from brokers via a secondary market), the highest capacity audiences (as a percentage of total seating capacity), and the highest ratio of actual grosses to potential grosses.The producers of Hamilton announced Monday that on Tuesday they would relaunch a digital lottery for $10 tickets, nearly a month after a first attempt to do so failed because so many people entered the lottery that its website crashed. The digital lottery will replace an in-person lottery that has been taking place outside the theater; the show said it planned to return to a live lottery in the spring."}
{"text": "Every week, The New York Times will choose one essential game to watch, highlighting hot teams, winning and losing streaks and statistical intrigue in the N.B.A.Indiana at Atlanta, Friday, 7 p.m. Eastern, ESPNSince LeBron James entered the N.B.A., he has made his home in the Eastern Conference, which his teams have dominated for the past five seasons. Any team that has reached the conference finals against Jamess Cleveland Cavaliers or his Miami Heat has been put to bed.In the last three seasons, the Atlanta Hawks (2015) and the Indiana Pacers (2014, 2013) were those unfortunate teams. Losing to James put those franchises in a tricky spot, not unlike the struggles faced by Eastern teams in the 90s, when an annual trip by the Chicago Bulls to the N.B.A. finals was tentatively scheduled before a season started. General managers in Atlanta and Indiana have had to consider rebuilding their successful teams, hoping to hit upon the magic wing or forward who might allow them to topple James.The Hawks have yet to make significant changes, but there have been reports that they are looking to unload Jeff Teague, their point guard. Teague, who reached the All-Star Game for the first time last year, has had a tough time this season. He often seems out of sync with the rest of the Hawks, and his game averages for points, assists and steals are all lower than last season. He has also been struggling with an ankle injury.The Hawks could have a replacement for Teague waiting in the wings. Dennis Schroder, the fleet third-year guard, often finishes out fourth quarters and has shown that he can make an impact in limited minutes, though he will need to improve his jump shooting if he wants to lead an N.B.A. franchise. Still, Schroders future with the Hawks seems less than secure: His name has also popped up in trade rumors, along with that of the reliable forward Al Horford, now in his ninth season in Atlanta.Horford, Kyle Korver and center Paul Millsap also appeared in last seasons All-Star Game. Korver was named to replace the injured Dwyane Wade, and his appearance allowed the Hawks to tie the record for most All-Stars from a single team in a season. It was a testament to the Hawks second-year coach, Mike Budenholzer, who led Atlanta to the best record in the Eastern Conference. And then the Cavaliers steamrollered them in the conference finals, 4-0.Korver has regressed this season, although he has been shooting well recently. And the Hawks have sunk back into the Eastern Conference muddle after that embarrassing sweep. Entering Sunday, Atlanta was tied for fourth in the conference with the Boston Celtics, two games ahead of the eighth-place Detroit Pistons.The Pacers have seen stars come and go since 2013-14, when they met James and the Heat for the second consecutive year in the conference finals. Their 2014-15 season was a wash after Paul George broke his leg during the summer and missed nearly the entire season. The same summer, the promising but volatile Lance Stephenson signed with the Charlotte Hornets. The following year, a suddenly mediocre Roy Hibbert was shipped to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for a second-round pick, and David West signed with the San Antonio Spurs, dissolving the Pacers successful core.But Indiana has been competitive this season, mostly on the back of George, who is having a terrific season. The Pacers have added players like Monta Ellis and Myles Turner, a 19-year-old rookie, who have provided some versatility on offense. The recent success of the 6-foot-11 Turner, who has played his way into the starting lineup, seems to have reversed the plans of the team, which had made a valiant effort to succeed with a small lineup. Entering Sunday, he had averaged 17.2 points and 7 rebounds in his last five games.Turner had his first start Thursday, and he scored 20 points as Indiana made short work of the Hawks, 111-92. Though the Pacers were in seventh place entering Sunday, they are very much in the thick of things in the Eastern Conference. If the Pacers are as dominant in Atlanta on Friday (7 p.m. Eastern, ESPN) as they were last week, it may be a sign that they are once again among the conference elite  and that Atlanta is right to consider roster changes.Not all is lost for either team. Both will most likely make the playoffs, and either could return to the conference finals. But the second-place Toronto Raptors should take note of the wreckage that King James leaves in his wake. While he is still in the league, it seems that the best his Eastern competitors can do is hope for runner-up, as his Cleveland Cavaliers, once again, seem bound for the finals."}
{"text": "When the jewelry designer Sophie Bille Brahe first met Chitose Abe, the founder and designer of the ready-to-wear label Sacai, at Dover Street Markets 10-year anniversary party in London in 2014, they instantly bonded. I have always admired Chitoses work and, when we met that night, she showed me she was wearing some of my jewelry, Bille Brahe says. The admiration, to my surprise and delight, was mutual. Almost immediately, the two designers started talking about how they could work together. We had the first conversation about a collaboration right then and there  and it became obvious that our styles were artistically compatible, says Bille Brahe.A year and a half later, the fruit of that discussion  a 10-piece capsule collection of fine jewelry  comes to Dover Street Markets in London and New York today and in Tokyo on Feb. 5, before rolling out further at international stores and online. (Pieces from the line first debuted at Sacais spring/summer 2016 show last October.)Its a fitting debut for a partnership that has spanned continents: Bille Brahe is based in Copenhagen while Abe calls Tokyo home. However, the duo found that a distance of a few thousand miles was practically convenient. Physically, we were far apart  but I have often worked with people from around the world, so I didnt find the distance to be a challenge, Abe says. Undaunted, the two quickly got to work, Skyping regularly and sending sketches via email. We have a similar design philosophy in that we take classic items and recreate them in new, modern ways, says Abe. We were able to come up with the general direction quite quickly.The idea was to take Bille Brahes signature aesthetic  delicate, sculptural baubles crafted using centuries-old goldsmith techniques from gold, pearls and diamonds  and filter it through the world of Sacai, a label with an intellectual bent and a loyal fanbase. I thought it would be interesting to take something very fine and delicate but use it to create something a bit tougher looking, Abe says. The resulting collection  sculptural earrings with teardrop pearls and diamond croissants lined with yellow gold fringing  more than meets that goal. The interpretation will always be individual to the observer, notes Bille Brahe. I just hope that whoever is wearing it really likes it."}

{"text": "The Pulitzer Prizes were established a century ago, and soon after, The New York Times won its first, for articles about World War I.Since then, The Times has garnered far more Pulitzers than any other news organization, 117 in all.Last week, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the prizes, the Pulitzer board held a gathering in Washington to honor hundreds of winners, going back decades.Dozens of prizewinning Times journalists, as well as editors who oversaw their work, took part in the celebration at the Newseum.They included Linda Greenhouse (1998, Supreme Court reporting), David Leonhardt (2011, financial commentary) and Tyler Hicks (2014, photos of a terrorist attack at an upscale mall in Nairobi, Kenya. )Neil Sheehan, who obtained the Pentagon papers for The Times, one of the most renowned scoops of the 20th century, attended with his wife, Susan Sheehan. The Times earned the Pulitzer for Public Service in 1972 for Pentagon papers coverage.Mr. Sheehan also won a Pulitzer in 1989 for his biography, A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam.

This, Mr. Friedman said, reflected the familys attitude toward journalistic independence and integrity.The fact that theres really only one such family left, still defending those values, is absolutely, absolutely such a privilege to be part of, he said.The publisher, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., thanked Mr. Friedman, but then addressed the journalists at the dinner.This is about all of you  it really is, he said.

{"text": "DALLAS  It was the morning after he had been named the next music director of the New York Philharmonic, and Jaap van Zweden was already back at work here at his current job, rehearsing the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in Mozarts Symphony No. 39 with the fastidiousness  and relentlessness  for which he has become known.He was unafraid to stop the orchestra to reshape the smallest phrases, asking the violins to repeat one seemingly simple seven-note passage 10 times in a row until a few subtle tweaks gave it new depth and color. When he brought the symphonys third movement to a halt at one point during Thursday mornings rehearsal, to tell the woodwind section that it had lost it there for a second, a player acknowledged him by saying, O.K.No, not O.K.! Mr. van Zweden said brusquely. Then everyone laughed, he clicked his tongue twice to give them the tempo, and the music began again  more to his liking.In a touchy-feely age in which modern ideas about workplace morale and collaborative management have made inroads even into orchestra conducting, traditionally one of the most autocratic of fields, Mr. van Zweden, 55, is more a maestro of the old school. He is sometimes polite, and sometimes quite blunt, but always very direct in seeking what he wants  the demanding teacher who, instead of giving a B-plus to a passable but unexceptional paper, will send it back riddled with cross-outs, order a rewrite and make it sparkle.That approach has lifted the standards of the Dallas Symphony since he became its music director in 2008, and put Mr. van Zweden before many of the worlds leading orchestras as a guest conductor. Last week, his rigorous style landed him the job at the New York Philharmonic, one of the most prestigious posts in the field, beginning in 2018  raising questions about how the ensembles sometimes willful players would take to such a demanding, direct style.If some New York critics questioned the appointment  wondering if he will be as innovative and as devoted to new music as the Philharmonics current music director, Alan Gilbert, and if he will be a good fund-raiser as the orchestra works to raise about $360 million to renovate David Geffen Hall and bolster its endowment  musicians, donors, critics and colleagues here seemed to think Mr. van Zweden would be a natural fit in his new position.He received a heros welcome when he arrived here to conduct three concerts over the weekend: a program that included the Mozart symphony, Poulencs Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, and the world premiere of Jeremy Gills Serenada Concertante for Oboe and Orchestra. Congratulations came in from royalty both musical (the conductors Riccardo Muti and Christoph von Dohnnyi sent messages) and bona fide (Mr. van Zweden, who is Dutch, received a text from King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands).And when Mr. van Zweden arrived at one of his favorite lunch spots on Friday  Toulouse, a French bistro where he regularly watches soccer  he was hugged by a waiter, who had seen the New York post announced on television, and congratulated by the headwaiter, who had heard the news on NPR.Mr. van Zweden is nothing if not intense. Sometimes, after the adrenaline rush of conducting, he will unwind by going to the movies: He has been known to catch the occasional late film after his Dallas concerts, and in January, after leading a 3 p.m. concert performance of Wagners Die Walkre in Hong Kong with his other orchestra, the Hong Kong Philharmonic, he went to a 10:20 p.m. showing of The Revenant.But more often, he said, what he likes best after a concert is to go over the score once again. I really believe in that, he said. I think the biggest celebration after a concert, at least for me, is I can sit down and I can improve it, at my desk. Thats a great celebration.Home here these days is a hotel; he and his wife, Aaltje, gave up their apartment to downsize and to simplify their three-continent lives, in which they divide their time among Dallas, Hong Kong and Amsterdam. When he is not working Mr. van Zweden, an avid sports fan, is often at Dallas Mavericks games; he has a signed basketball in his studio at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the imposing I. M. Pei-designed hall where the orchestra plays.He knows how ensembles work from the inside: Mr. van Zweden was a violinist before he was a conductor, and at the age of 19 he became the youngest concertmaster in the history of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, where he remains well known. A multipart documentary about his musical career is running on Dutch television, and while he was still a violinist he appeared in an offbeat Audi commercial. In 2001 he made the news for a more troubling reason: He and a friend were carjacked and robbed at gunpoint by two men who were later imprisoned. (Mr. van Zweden was unhurt.)His no-nonsense style has led to some tensions, not uncommon in orchestras, which spilled into public view in 2014 when The Dallas Morning News reported that some players here found him abrasive. Ken Krause, president of the Dallas-Fort Worth Professional Musicians Association, said in an interview that while there had been some tensions, Mr. van Zwedens relationship with the orchestra seems to have improved. From what I gather, everybody is happy for him and will miss him, he said.Mr. van Zweden lured one of his successors at the Concertgebouw  Alexander Kerr, who had left Amsterdam to teach at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music  to be concertmaster here. Mr. Kerr said that Mr. van Zweden was simply direct. And inspiring. He doesnt beat around the bush, he said. Its not about political correctness, its about getting to the heart of the matter quickly and efficiently, and its all about the music. Theres nothing personal.Gary Levinson, the senior principal associate concertmaster, played with the New York Philharmonic before he came to Dallas. When he was called by members of the Philharmonics search committee and some of his old colleagues, he said, they were more interested in asking about how versatile Mr. van Zweden is in different repertory than in his rehearsal demeanor.My feeling is that theres nothing he really cant do, Mr. Levinson said, adding that he thought that his colleagues in New York were fine with tough maestros, as long as they have the goods.When the news broke that Mr. van Zweden would be going to New York, Demarre McGill, the principal flute player in Dallas, received a text from his brother, Anthony McGill, who is the New York Philharmonics principal clarinetist. Hey, its like we play in the same orchestra for once, it said. We will have the same music director!At Friday nights concert Mr. van Zweden cut an imposing figure on the podium: He is 5 feet 7 inches tall and powerfully built, with broad shoulders, a shaved head and what could be described as a short beard or fashionably long stubble. When the concert ended, with a standing ovation for the Mozart symphony, the first musicians he called to stand and be recognized were the woodwind players he had put through their paces the day before.Then Mr. van Zweden dashed backstage, changed out of the Nehru-style jacket he had conducted in, and went to the green room to meet with a small crowd of donors, thanking them for their support over the years  greeting many by name, remembering to ask about family members, gamely posing for photos and signing a CD. Then it was back to his office.His busy week, which had taken him from Hong Kong to New York to Dallas, was nearing its end. The orchestra had played well, he said, and he had enjoyed the world premiere.So was he pleased? Had he gotten what he was looking for in rehearsals?Yeah, well, there are always things, he said. What I can improve."}
{"text": "A strong, intelligent woman struggles to break through the double-pane glass ceiling of a top investment firm on Wall Street.A rich, good-looking investment banker makes a killing on mortgage-backed securities, the toxic bundles of debt that in 2008 put the economy on the edge of collapse.Actually, the two people are one and the same: Isabelle, the heroine of Opening Belle, a comic, semiautobiographical first-person novel by Maureen Sherry, a former managing director at Bear Stearns, which collapsed in 2008.I dont feel like I made light of anyones pain, Ms. Sherry said, sitting at the dining room table of her Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking the Central Park reservoir. Ms. Sherry said she wanted to write about the mortgage crisis in an engaging way that ordinary readers could understand and also show them that many bankers were as hoodwinked as the rest of the public.Its easy to bash Wall Street, and we hear a lot of it, she said. I also wanted to make clear to the reader the good that banks do as well as the bad.Opening Belle, which will be in bookstores on Tuesday, is a twist on a subgenre of contemporary womens fiction known as chick lit. Warner Brothers is developing a movie version starring Reese Witherspoon.It is also the latest in a growing number of books, plays, television shows and movies addressing Wall Street during and after the 2008 crisis. There are two television series about Bernard L. Madoff, who was arrested in 2008 for what turned out to be one of historys largest frauds. Sony Pictures Classics bought the rights to Equity, a thriller about an investment banker who is undercut by rival female executives. The Big Short was nominated for a best picture Oscar. Billions, on Showtime, is a present-day Wall Street drama that is colored by the financial meltdown. (Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times is a co-creator of the show.)Ms. Sherrys novel is a breezy comedy in the style of Bridget Joness Diary.Like her heroine, Ms. Sherry worked on the Bear Stearns trading floor, then a notoriously rowdy place. She said she took the frat-boy antics in stride. I felt embarrassed sometimes, but not unsafe, she said.She left in 2000 to take care of her growing family, not to flee a hostile workplace, but she said she did feel frustrated by the barriers to advancement. She began thinking about what she wanted to write about women on Wall Street, got an M.F.A. from Columbia and wrote a childrens book. She also recently wrote a New York Times opinion piece on pay inequity and sexism.In her novel, she presents those experiences as farce. A comic tone, she said, would make the subject more accessible and widen the conversation.Isabelle endures the lewd jokes and groping of male colleagues and bosses to sell, among other things, collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.s. By 2007, Isabelle is on a bond-trading roll  until the market collapses, wiping out her gains and throwing more than one million people out of their homes.After the market begins to fall, Isabelle and a client take a closer look at the underlying bank records, zeroing in on a family in Nebraska facing foreclosure. My eyes well up and we sit there for a moment with something bordering wonder, Isabelle writes in what is presented as her memoir. I never saw things going this way.The novels dueling themes divide the mass-market publishing world. Some observers say readers might embrace it as a lighthearted but inspiring empowerment parable. I think it can work, said Louisa Ermelino, the reviews director at Publishers Weekly, who has not read the work but knows its gist. Even though she is rich and powerful, shes still a woman up against men in suits on Wall Street.For other students of the genre, though, its a step too far in favor of the 1 percent. I would expect a novel set in the mortgage crisis to look at the precarious situations of more ordinary working women, said Suzanne Ferriss, an English professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a co-editor of Chick Lit: The New Womans Fiction.There was a backlash against Primates of Park Avenue,  Ms. Ferriss noted, referring to a tongue-in-cheek memoir by Wednesday Martin about trying to fit in on the Upper East Side. That suggests to me that in the current climate, this might not have many followers.This question of whether feminism outweighs populism echoes the countervailing currents in the presidential race. Voters in the Democratic primary are watching an accomplished, experienced member of the establishment, Hillary Clinton, argue that the top echelons of power are rigged against women, while her main rival, Bernie Sanders, has soared in the polls by saying that the system is rigged in favor of the rich and powerful. Republicans are watching a billionaire populist, Donald Trump, clash with Megyn Kelly, a star anchor at Fox News who questioned his respect for women in a debate.When asked whom she supported, Ms. Sherry smiled and said, Im waiting for Michael Bloomberg to get in the race.The heroine of Opening Belle resembles Ms. Sherry, but with a little less gilt and gloss. I wanted her to be relatable, Ms. Sherry said.Both went to Cornell. Isabelle is first-generation American. Ms. Sherrys father was an Irish immigrant. In his younger days, her father worked as a porter in the same Fifth Avenue building where her eventual boss, Alan C. Greenberg, the legendary chairman of Bear Stearns, who died in 2014, had an apartment.Isabelle, blond and 5-foot-11, has three children and a handsome husband who doesnt work (but still doesnt do his share of housework). They live on Central Park West.Ms. Sherry, blond and 5-foot-11, has four children and is married to a private-equity investor, Steven B. Klinsky. They have a house in Southampton, and their 4,200-square-foot wood-paneled apartment was once part of a triplex built for the philanthropist Marjorie Merriweather Post.In a good year, Isabelle earns $3 million. Ms. Sherry said she considered how that would play to readers, but she wanted to be realistic. I hate the term Manhattan poor,  she said, but added that after taxes, as a couple with one income and three private-school tuitions, They werent living large.Isabelle thinks its O.K. to want to make money, Ms. Sherry said, and ambition is not a bad thing.Ms. Sherry interviewed former colleagues and a new generation of bankers. She said she found that while the most overt harassment has generally stopped, hurdles remain, particularly for working mothers. They feel they never performed better, yet they feel written off, she said.At Bear Stearns, Ms. Sherry said she and her female peers jokingly referred to themselves as The Glass Ceiling Club. In the novel, Isabelle joins a secret society of the same name. Her female colleagues share their grievances about men and the young female assistants on the trading floor who flirt with their bosses and let them think all women welcome their advances. One dresses so provocatively she is nicknamed Naked Girl.Ms. Sherry said her editors took out one scene she wrote where a woman goes to lunch with her boss to discuss her accounts and he instead invites her to spend the afternoon in bed. Ms. Sherry noted that she knows women who had the same experience in real life.One is Sandra Ripert, a real estate agent today who was a Bear Stearns assistant 25 years ago and an aspiring trader who felt she wasnt taken seriously because she lacked the right degrees or connections. As a woman and as a Latina  I was very sultry-looking  it was hard to get ahead, Ms. Ripert said.In the early 1990s, Ms. Ripert said, when she was earning $24,000 a year, a boss invited her to lunch and she thought it meant she was in line for promotion. Instead, she said, her boss told her he had booked a room for them. She left the firm not long after.Back then, Ms. Ripert said, she found Ms. Sherry very professional and very quiet, and also enviable. At that time, you just wanted to be a Maureen Sherry."}
{"text": "Tremendous news lastweek: Google announced that it had created a computer program that defeated a professional player at Go an event that many thought was still a decade away.This week wecelebrate this victory witha simplestrategy challenge suggested by our friends at Brilliant.org, the online community for students and professionals looking for tantalizing problems, like-minded peers, and mentorship. Our discussion will be moderated by Brilliants Zandra Vinegar.But before we begin what did this computer program (called AlphaGo) actually accomplish, andwhat is the significance of this breakthrough? For perspectives on this I reached out to several people familiar with artificial intelligence and its quest to conquer Go:Rodrigo Alvarez, who helped design abreakthrough cognitive computing chip aspart of IBMs TrueNorth. (In case you missed it, IBM Develops a New Chip That Functions Like a Brain.) Bob Hearn, whostudied AI at MIT and is a 2-dan Go player and longtime follower  and organizer  of humanvs. machine Go contests. And Alan Levinovitz, who wroteThe Mystery of Go, the Ancient Game That Computers Still Cant Win, whichappeared in Wired magazine in 2014.Gary Antonick: Machine learning has recently enabledcomputers to recognize faces and understand spoken language. Why is the ability to winGo such big news?Alan Levinovitz: Contests, especially contests modeled on war, feel like objective, decisive assessments of ability. Chess and Go have long enjoyed pride of place as contests that decide which human has a more powerful mind  pure skill, no luck. When computers beat us, it seems as if the quest to make a humanlike mind must be close to over.Bob Hearn: Go was the last bastion of human superiority at whats historically been viewed as quintessentially intellectual. This is it. Were out of games now. This is seen by some as a harbinger of the approaching singularity.Alan: But of course these games are far from being measures of who is the most human human (whatever that means). Single-player, deterministic perfect information games like chess and Go are actually well-suited to computers  theres not much psychology (like poker), no teamwork (like bridge). And rule-bound games are themselves better arenas for computers than the un-rule-governed games of life like figuring out whether someone is speaking in earnest, or really loves you, whether theyre looking off into the distance or avoiding your gaze. Theres no doubt that, a few singularity-worshipping cheerleaders aside, we are very, very far from creating anything that resembles a human mind.Bob: The other factor at play here is the space race to conquer Go, due to the history and symbolism of the task, with Google and Facebook at the forefront. This is huge PR for Google. They have somewhat jumped the gun saying they have mastered Go, just to make sure Facebook doesnt do the same thing to them first. Its worth remembering that Deep Blue started beating chess grandmasters eight years before it was able to beat Kasparov. In principle the same thing could happen here, though I very much doubt it would take another eight years. Maybe two or three at the outside.Gary: How does AI work for games like chess, and what was the innovation behind AlphaGo?Rodrigo Alvarez: The way AI works for chess and similar board games is called tree search. Itcreates a tree of potential paths that the game could evolve into, and then selects the best candidate move looking as far ahead as possible. The best chess playing games could quickly search up to about 14 moves ahead, and at this point they start beating grand masters. The problem is that for chess the tree grows very quickly, and for Go it goes even quicker because there are less constrains on each move and the board is larger.Bob: My prediction during this era was that to get a human pro-level Go program, you would first have to solve AI.But about 10 years ago, everything changed. Go software started incorporating Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The idea here is to play out hundreds of thousands of random games from the current position all the way to the end, and accumulate statistics on wins and losses. It sounds crazy, but if you put the statistics together the right way, this actually works.I was at the first match where a computer beat a pro, in 2008. It was a 9-stone handicap game, against an 8-dan pro (much stronger than Fan Hui). Nine stones is typically the largest handicap given between human players. Still, this was seen as a shocking, amazing development. And honestly, the leap from the pre-MCTS Go programs to MCTS was greater than from MCTS to AlphaGo.That began the modern era of computer Go. (I guess with deep learning we are now in postmodern era?) As the MCTS was refined beyond the basic algorithm, and specialized for Go, and as computers got faster, the programs continued to improve.Heres an example of the coverage following a match I arranged at the 2009 AAAS meeting. Note that the headlines dont sound that different from todays: Humans No Match for Go Bot Overlords, Computers conquer the final frontier in board games.Since then computer Go has been kind of waiting for the next big breakthrough  and deep learning is it.Gary: What was the big insight behind AlphaGo?Bob: What they did was apply deep learning separately to the two problems with tree search: the branching factor, and the position evaluator. MCTS had already solved position evaluation, but the insight here was tonotplay games out to the end, but cut them off at 20 moves or so, then use a deep-learning based evaluator (the value network in the AlphaGo paper). So they dont have to play out as many games as traditional MCTS. To address the branching factor, they have an independent deep-learning network suggesting the best moves to search from each position (the policy network).Both deep-learning networks seem to capture some subtle aspects of Go knowledge and understanding that MCTS cant. They work more like brains do. But not exactly like brains do  human Go knowledge is more than just a learned ability to seethe best moves, and see at a glance who is ahead or behind. Its also a learned ability of how to use this knowledge to explore alternatives and pick the best move, and there is a complex interplay there between perception and planning that does not exist yet in deep-learning systems. Thats where the raw computing power of MCTS fills the gap. Its a very interesting question whether, as with the plain MCTS systems, there may still be essential aspects of the game that the best humans are able to conceptualize, and deep learning plus MCTS is not.In recent months alone Ive been shocked at the progress of deep learning in many areas. If I were not an idiot I would now be spending all my time catching up in this field, because its going to be huge. AlphaGo is just the beginning. In another year or two, things we cant even imagine will change enormously due to deep learning.Gary: This recent news was about AlphaGo beating the European champion, Fan Hui. In March, AlphaGo will be facing the worlds top player, Lee Sedol. WillAlphaGo win?Bob: There are at least hundreds of stronger players than Fan Hui, and the gap between him and Lee Sedol is actually enormous. ButGoogle has a lot at stake in this match, and youd better believe theyll throw everything they have at Lee Sedol.Alan: Its hard to imagine DeepMind challenging Sedol to a March match unless they were very, very confident in AlphaGos abilities. Nevertheless, my money is on Sedol, in part because therearevery few people who can genuinely understand what distinguishes someone like Sedol from Fan Hui, and whether AlphaGo is playing at that level. Without playing Sedol or another 9-dan player, I cant imagine how AlphaGo could be so confident.But I wouldnt bet too much!Bob: Its anybodys guess what will happen in March. However, even if AlphaGo loses, it seems clear that the writing is on the wall, and it wont be long.Rodrigo Alvarez, Bob Hearn and Alan Levinovitz  thank you all very much. Lets now return to Zandra Vinegar and this weeks challenge.This weeks problem is an unusual challenge, in that your goal is to design a strategy that would allow a computer to play a simple game:\n\nSAY 16The rules:Each player takes turns saying between one and three consecutive numbers, with the first player starting with the number 1. For example, Player 1 could say the numbers 1 and 2, then Player 2 can say 3, 4, 5, then Player 1 can say 6 and so on.The goal of the game is to be the one to say 16.Design the strategy that an AI on a website could use to play this game against online users. Can you develop a strategy that wins consistently?Machine-learning definitely isnt required for programming an AI to play Say 16, but if youre game for it, try altering the games rules or design your own game from scratch. Perhaps you can design a game thats as difficult for computers to master as Go has proved to be! In any case, please tell us about your progress in the comments!And, if you want to learn more about game theory and strategy, try these additional game theory challenges on Brilliant.(Credit: a version of the Say 16 game was originally posted to Brilliant.org by Garrett C.)Thank you, Zandra!

{"text": "TEHRAN  A political battle is taking shape in Iran over any new foreign role in developing the countrys enormous oil wealth, only a few weeks after the Iranian nuclear deal with foreign powers relaxed tough economic sanctions.The battle pits hard-liners, including some who opposed the nuclear deal, against moderates aligned with President Hassan Rouhani, who has touted that deal as denoting a new economic era for Iran. Already the battle is threatening to complicate efforts to bring in much-needed foreign investment for Irans outdated oil industry, which remains a critical source of revenue for the country.On Saturday, hard-line students gathered in front of the Oil Ministry in Tehran to protest the terms of a proposed contract that would permit foreign oil companies to help revitalize outdated wells and infrastructure. The proposal amounted to the plundering of national wealth, the students shouted.Dozens of protesters were arrested by riot police officers who severely beat up female students, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported.At the same time, new doubts have arisen about a conference organized by the Oil Ministry scheduled for February in London, where the contract was to be presented. A ministry official was quoted on Saturday by Seda, an Iranian magazine, as saying that the conference had been canceled.The official, Ali Kardor, deputy head of the national oil company, was quoted as saying that there was no need for such a conference because bidding by foreign oil companies would be held in May. But he also suggested that the conference had been canceled because Iranian participants had faced problems obtaining visas to attend.It remains unclear precisely why the conference was canceled. It had been announced and postponed four times, hinting at disagreements over the terms.The protests in front of the Oil Ministry appear to have originated partly over anger at President Rouhanis trip last week to Italy and France, where he signed a memorandum of understanding with the French firm Total to export up to 200,000 barrels of Iranian crude oil a day, the first deal following the lifting of the sanctions.Irans oil industry needs around $150 billion in investments, industry experts have estimated. The lifting of the sanctions on Jan. 16 allows oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Spains Repsol and ENI of Italy to return to Iran where they had all long been active before sanctions started biting in 2012.American oil companies are banned under United States law from working in Iran.The proposed contract for foreign oil companies, known as the Iran Petroleum Contract, is meant to replace older contracts that industry officials regard as obsolete. Under the proposal, outside oil companies would gain rights to a set percentage of Irans enormous oil reserves for 20 or 25 years.According to Reza Zandi, an Iranian journalist who specializes in the oil and gas industries, the issue concerns language in the Iranian Constitution, which prohibits privatization or foreign ownership of the exploration and production sections of the oil industry. The proposed contract has been interpreted by some as circumventing that prohibition.Who owns the oil is an especially sensitive subject in Iran, where Britain controlled almost all crude in the first half of the last century, paying Iranian rulers next to nothing in return.In 1953, the countrys first democratically chosen prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized the countrys oil industry, angering the British who in turn encouraged the United States to organize a coup dtat in Iran. Mr. Mossadegh was ousted from power but Britain never regained control of Irans crude.Opponents of the new contract say that it will allow oil majors to control at least a part of Irans oil, which they regard as national wealth. They accuse the Oil Ministry and Mr. Rouhani of sweetening the proposed contract to such an extent that foreign companies will be able to all but own oil wells.Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst with close ties to some of Irans highest leaders, said the proposed contract means a return to pre-Mossadegh times, when the consortiums had the upper hand in everything.With oil constituting at least one-third of Irans annual income, the issue goes far beyond just the Oil Ministry or its subsidiary, the National Iranian Oil Company. All major centers of power are involved in some way or another, and the increasing protest over the proposed contract illustrates differences of opinion over its terms, analysts say.In November, the cabinet endorsed the contract, but the Expediency Discernment Council, an oversight body, will examine its content, the semiofficial Mehr news agency reported on Saturday.The cancellation of the conference gives the opportunity for more domestic consensus on the oil contract, Mr. Zandi said.One influential conservative lawmaker, Ahmad Tavakkoli, expressed support for the student protest and said that the contract language needed much more careful scrutiny. Even dozens of street protests are too few to criticize the agreement, Mr. Tavakkoli was quoted as saying by Fars."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are locked in an increasingly bitter fight in New Hampshire. Both men have anchored their presidential campaigns in the state, holding dozens of town hall meetings and spending most of their money in an effort to seize momentum here.The latest round of campaign finance filings revealed just how high the stakes are in New Hampshire for Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie. Mr. Christies campaign reported that it had only $1.1 million in the bank at the start of January. Mr. Kasich fared a bit better, with $2.5 million in reserve.Without a standout performance in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, it may rapidly become difficult for either governor to pay for the fundamentals of campaigning in the next round of elections in South Carolina and Nevada, and beyond.Neither Mr. Kasich nor Mr. Christie is expected to fare well Monday night in the Iowa caucuses, a contest they have both effectively bypassed as Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have dominated the campaign in that first voting state.In New Hampshire, Mr. Trump has held a wide lead over a pack of opponents in every public poll, with no clear second-place favorite.Mr. Christie said in appearances on ABCs Good Morning America and MSNBCs Morning Joe on Monday that his goal was to emerge from the first two states as the leading candidate among the governors in the race  Mr. Kasich and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida.Its who we beat, whos behind us, that matters the most, Mr. Christie said on MSNBC.Two other candidates embraced by the political establishment have invested significant resources in New Hampshire: Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But they have enough financial power arrayed behind them to persist in the race even after an unimpressive New Hampshire finish.While both Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio have looked to New Hampshire as an opportunity to gain steam in the campaign, they have both also laid the groundwork for a longer fight, spending time and money in South Carolina, Nevada and other states, where Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie have not focused their attention.Mr. Rubio finished last month with $10.4 million in the bank, and a super PAC supporting his campaign had about $14 million more. Mr. Bush had $7.6 million on hand and his super PAC had almost $59 million stockpiled.Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich also have super PACs supporting them, and may be relying on a strong New Hampshire finish to draw new, large donations into these outside groups.The pro-Christie group, America Leads, had $3.3 million at the start of January. Thesuper PAC supporting Mr. Kasich, New Day for America, had $2 million in the bank, though a strategist for the group said it had taken in $4 million more in the last month.The two super PACs have exchanged attacks in recent weeks, as the competition between Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie has intensified. Over the weekend, the pro-Christie group began running a television commercial criticizing Mr. Kasich for having worked at Lehman Brothers, the failed investment bank."}
{"text": "To the Editor:I appreciate the response of Robert Reischauer, a former senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, to our proposal that Harvard eliminate undergraduate tuition (letter, Jan. 23). He calls it unnecessary given the enormous yearly income from the endowment. He faults our suggestion as unwarranted, since Harvard already provides generous financial aid and also has an obligation to preserve the long-term value of those funds. I disagree.While it is true that students with family income of $65,000 or less may now attend Harvard tuition free, lets consider a couple living in New York City with one child, a combined income of more than $180,000 and savings of $100,000. Based on the Harvard net price calculator, they would pay a four-year total cost of $150,000 (including room and board) to send their son or daughter to Harvard.This seems a severe financial burden to many middle-class and upper-middle-class couples.Totally eliminating tuition at the college would require merely using 4 percent of Harvards yearly investment income while still allowing the remaining 96 percent to be reinvested in the financial activities that appear to constitute the primary purpose of the totally tax-exempt $38 billion endowment, now ranking as one of the worlds largest hedge funds.I hardly think that spending such a tiny slice of Harvards investment income on education is so unreasonable, and I find it difficult to believe that undisclosed restrictions on the universitys financial holdings would legally prohibit this.RON UNZChairman, Free Harvard/Fair HarvardPalo Alto, Calif."}
{"text": "The wealthy donors who have built a powerful shadow Republican Party of outside groups are rapidly cleaving into two mutually hostile and deep-pocketed factions, complicating efforts to deny the partys nomination to Donald J. Trump, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday showed.Many of the Wall Street financiers who have been mainstays of Republican super PACs in the six years since the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision have rallied behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, betting that he is the partys best chance to win a general election battle against Hillary Clinton.In the last six months of 2015, F.E.C. records show, a super PAC backing Mr. Rubio raised $14.3 million, including $2.5 million each from the hedge fund founders Paul Singer and Ken Griffin. The super PAC also drew significant support from donors who previously gave to groups backing Jeb Bush, among them Chris Cline, a coal executive, and Brian Ballard, a prominent Florida lobbyist.But the steady rise of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Tea Party favorite reviled by party leaders, has unleashed a new counter-establishment of conservative donors, some from outside the universe of traditional Republican giving. They include wealthy evangelicals, libertarian businessmen, Israel hawks and others disenchanted by the partys past nominees, and are drawn to Mr. Cruzs uncompromising social conservatism and his promise to disrupt the partys traditional power brokers in Washington.Mr. Cruzs backers include the Wilks family of Texas, who made a fortune in the shale oil boom and are prominent donors to anti-abortion groups; Edward Czuker, a Los Angeles real estate developer and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition; and the Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein, who gave $1 million to a pro-Cruz super PAC in January.I think were rewriting history, said Mica Mosbacher, a longtime Republican fund-raiser with ties to the Bush family, who decided to back Mr. Cruz because she was tired of the party nominating moderates and career politicians.Weve got a civil war within the party, Ms. Mosbacher added. And people want someone who is strong.Mr. Trump has responded to their largess with an influx of his own money: In the last quarter of 2015, the billionaire businessman lent his campaign $10.8 million, according to F.E.C. reports, and raised just $2.7 million from other donors.Yet as caucusgoers gather in Iowa on Monday, Mr. Trump is at the top of the polls, and most of the money flowing into the Republican primary has been spent on attack ads targeting candidates other than the leader.Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Mr. Rubio, has spent $3.2 million attacking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey  an effort to stifle Mr. Christie in New Hampshire  and $3.3 million against Mr. Cruz. The main group supporting Mr. Bush, Right to Rise USA, has spent $1.5 million against Mr. Rubio and $366,000 against John Kasich. Super PACs backing Mr. Cruz have spent more than $1.4 million against Mr. Rubio.The expensive five-way shootout is a sharp departure from 2012, when virtually all of the Republican donors inclined to write seven-figure checks rallied behind a single candidate, Mitt Romney. And it presents a stark contrast to the Democratic contest, where the biggest checks raised by outside groups have all gone to Priorities USA, a super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton. Priorities reported that it had raised $51 million since the beginning of last year, including a $6 million contribution in December from the liberal hedge fund billionaire George Soros. The biggest outside group supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is funded entirely by a nurses union, pooling small contributions from members.The vast amounts of money still flowing into the race  combined with Mr. Trumps knack for running an effective campaign without the benefit of substantial super PAC support  suggest that there may be no quick end to the nomination battle, despite Mr. Trumps lead in most of the early Republican contests.While Mr. Bush raised less money for his campaign in the last quarter of 2015, the super PAC supporting him, Right to Rise, had $59 million on hand at years end, and likely has enough remaining to bludgeon other Republicans. Many of the groups donors could move to support Mr. Rubio if Mr. Bush falters in New Hampshire.The pro-Rubio group, Conservative Solutions, had $14 million cash on hand, not including money held by an affiliated nonprofit that is not required to disclose its fund-raising. Mr. Cruzs groups have recently spent another $1.4 million attacking Mr. Trump, who has overtaken Mr. Cruz in Iowa, a state where 60 percent of the Republican electorate identifies as evangelical. But the Cruz groups remain flush: As of the end of December, they had $32 million in cash on hand.David Barton, an evangelical activist in Texas who runs Keep the Promise, an umbrella group of pro-Cruz super PACs, said the groups success was a reaction to earlier outside groups that wasted money on candidates uninspiring to conservative voters. Anti-establishment donors, he said, finally have something that is closer to where they would like to give. And it is also closer to what they believe.Yet the filings on Sunday reflect another reaction, as well. Mr. Sanders reported raising more than $33 million during the three months ending in December, most of it from grass-roots donors. In January, his campaign announced on Sunday, he took in an additional $20 million. The money has sustained him against Mrs. Clinton, who has built a more traditional campaign operation relying far more on donors giving the maximum contribution of $2,700. In Iowa, the two candidates are neck-and-neck, with Mr. Sanders holding on to a lead in New Hampshire. Both have enough money to compete effectively in the primaries and caucuses that follow.And Mr. Trump, beyond his loans to himself, has raised most of the rest of his money from small donors, including $2.7 million in the final quarter of 2015. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have appealed to smaller donors in part by promising supporters they cannot be bought by the bigger ones. Both have eschewed the dominant super PAC model of the 2016 cycle, where candidates typically have dispatched a trusted aide to raise unlimited money for an outside group. Neither has set up committees of wealthy bundlers drumming up checks from friends and family members. Neither man spends much time at fund-raisers.The traditional campaign spends most of its time raising money so that it can pay to get its message out, said John Pudner, executive director of Take Back Our Republic, a conservative group that promotes small-donor giving. Trump broke down the means, which is collect a lot of money. Hes found a different means to the same end."}

Personal income is expected to rise by 0.2 percent. Patricia CohenAutomakers on Tuesday are scheduled to report sales of new vehicles in the United States for January. While the pace of sales was brisk for most of the month, overall industry volumes were probably curtailed by the effects of severe weather in the Northeast and Southern states.On Wednesday, General Motors, the nations biggest automaker, will announce its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results for 2015. The company is expected to report an increase in profits from the previous year, despite spending more than $2 billion to settle a Justice Department investigation into defective ignition switches tied to 124 deaths and to compensate victims of wrecks in the affected vehicles. Bill VlasicExxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP will report their quarterly earnings starting on Tuesday, and the results are not expected to be pretty. Oil prices dropped nearly 20 percent in the fourth quarter, and natural gas prices also slumped. The only saving grace for the integrated oil companies is that they have large refining and chemical businesses that are helped by the low prices of the raw materials they process.The biggest oil companies have put off, so far, the large dividend cuts of the smaller independents, but they can be expected to announce more cuts in investments and, maybe, personnel. Analysts will be listening closely for hints that the companies are looking to buy up the cheap assets of companies that are under financial stress. Clifford KraussLooking for ways to help Puerto Rico pay off nearly $72 billion in debt, a House Natural Resources subcommittee will hold a hearing in Washington on Tuesday to consider whether a federal authority should be created to oversee the islands spending and budget.Some members of Congress have suggested that a control board would be a condition of granting financial relief to the commonwealth. Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration have been urging a variety of steps to help Puerto Rico, including giving the island bankruptcy protection, but Republicans have been reluctant. Recently, the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, urged members of Congress to work toward a solution.Also on Tuesday, the president of the Puerto Rico Senate, Eduardo Bhatia, a Democrat, will begin a series of hearings in San Juan aimed at exploring the reasons behind the $9 billion debt facing the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Mary Williams WalshEuropean banks will be in the spotlight again this week as the Swiss lenders UBS and Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas of France are set to report their annual results. The mood has been somber, so far, as turmoil in the markets has eaten into fourth-quarter revenue and several banks have taken charges for litigation and conduct issues.Last week, Deutsche Bank posted a huge loss in 2015 and the Royal Bank of Scotland said it would once again post an annual loss. Both banks said they were taking charges to resolve past misconduct. Banco Santander of Spain also saw much of its fourth-quarter profit eroded by one-time charges. Chad BrayEuropes national privacy regulators will pass judgment on Wednesday over renewed efforts by American and European lawmakers to allow companies to move digital data from peoples online searches and social media posts between the two regions.The decision will be closely watched by companies like Google and Facebook, which are expected to face further legal challenges by European privacy campaigners over how they collect, manage and use individuals data when transferred to the United States. Mark ScottA House committee will hold a hearing Thursday on the rapid increase in drug prices. Martin Shkreli, the former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who is facing federal securities fraud charges, is listed by the committee as a witness but is expected to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and not answer questions. Turing, under Mr. Shkrelis leadership, spurred a firestorm of controversy with its 50-fold increase in the price of a decades-old drug for a parasitic disease. The committee subpoenaed Mr. Shkreli and wrangled with his lawyers.Also scheduled to testify is Howard B. Schiller, the interim chief executive of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which has also been criticized for huge price increases, most recently by the Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. The hearing, originally scheduled for Jan. 26, was postponed because of a snowstorm. Andrew PollackNavinder Singh Sarao, a British futures trader, is expected back in court on Thursday for a two-day hearing to determine whether he will be sent to the United States to face charges that he engaged in improper trading that contributed to a sudden plunge in American stock markets in 2010 known as the flash crash. Mr. Sarao was arrested in Britain in April and has been fighting extradition. Chad BrayOn Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release figures on hiring and unemployment in January. Given the drop on Wall Street since the beginning of the year, as well as the anemic data for economic growth that have been accumulating recently, economists will be closely watching this report to see how the job market has been holding up. The consensus calls for a gain of 195,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 5 percent.But there is plenty of reason to think a surprise is possible. Decembers gain of 292,000 jobs was unusually strong. As a result, some experts see some payback in January as growth moderates. On the other hand, the service sector of the economy is doing fairly well, so January could bring another positive surprise. Nelson D. Schwartz"}
{"text": "There was just one witness to the moment Kenny Sailors helped revolutionize the game of basketball  his brother, Bud  but by all accounts, no one has ever doubted their story.The moment came on a hot May day in 1934. The two were battling, one on one, under an iron rim nailed to the side of the familys windmill, a wood-shingled, big-bladed landmark that their neighbors on the Wyoming high plains recognized for miles around, the way sailors of the usual kind know a lighthouse from miles out at sea.Kenny, a 13-year-old spring-legged featherweight, was dribbling this way and that on the hardpan, trying to drive to the basket, when Bud began taunting him, as older brothers will.Lets see if you can get a shot up over me, Bud said. A high school basketball standout, he had five years on his brother and, at the time, almost a foot in height.Kenny took the challenge, doing what people at a disadvantage often do: He improvised. He squared up, planted his feet and leapt.I had to think of something, he said in an interview a lifetime later.What he thought of was the jump shot, a basketball innovation that would one day be seen as comparable to the forward pass in football.Sailors, who died at 95 on Saturday in Laramie, Wyo., would never say flat out that he had invented the shot on that day or any other. No one can say for sure who did. The early 20th century produced enough far-flung claimants to that distinction to fill out a starting five and warm a decent-size bench  players like Glenn Roberts, Bud Palmer, Mouse Gonzalez, Jumpin Joe Fulks, Hank Luisetti and Belus Van Smawley.But people of reliable authority have said that if they had to pick the one whose prototypical jump shot was the purest, whose mechanics set in motion a scoring technique that thrilled fans and helped transform a two-handed, flat-footed, essentially earthbound affair into the vertical game it is today  giving rise, quite literally, to marksmen like Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Rick Barry, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant  it would be Sailors.Sailors developed the shot in high school, perfected it in college as a three-time all-American and was one of the few players of his era to make a living off it in the professional ranks.He did so in the face of skeptics. The game back then was all about quick passing to find the open man and shooting from the chest, with two hands, feet on the floor. Watching Sailors play, a coach told him, Youve got to get yourself a good two-hand set shot, and benched him.But Sailors, ever the freewheeler  one day he would guide hunters into the Alaskan wilderness  ignored the advice, to the delight of fans in Laramie, where, as the point guard, he led the University of Wyoming Cowboys on an improbable ride to their only N.C.A.A. championship, in 1943. Their run made the college powerhouses of the East and the big-city reporters who covered them sit up and take notice of Western basketball.If anyone can be said to have immortalized Sailors, it is the Life magazine photographer Eric Schaal. He was courtside at Madison Square Garden in January 1946 when, in a game between Wyoming and Long Island University, his camera caught Sailors airborne.In the picture, Sailors, in black high-tops, is suspended a full yard above the hardwood and at least that much over the outstretched hand of his hapless defender. The ball is cradled above his head, his elbow at 90 degrees, his right hand poised to fling the shot with a snap of the wrist that would have the ball spinning along a high arc toward the rim.The photograph, appearing in one of Americas most widely circulating magazines, made an impact from coast to coast.A shot whose origins could be traced to isolated pockets across the country  from the North Woods to the Ozarks, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Pacific  was suddenly by virtue of one picture as widespread as the game itself, John Christgau wrote in his book The Origins of the Jump Shot. Everywhere, young players on basketball courts began jumping to shoot.As the books subtitle  Eight Men Who Shook the World of Basketball  acknowledges, the jump shot had many fathers, all within a few years of one another, suggesting that in the long evolution of the game, the shots time had ineluctably come.Each inventor had his own variation. Van Smawley, with his back to the basket, would corkscrew around to face the hoop before releasing the ball; Luisettis was a running one-hander. But Christgau picked Sailorss technique as the one modern fans would recognize.I would say that squared up toward the basket, body hanging straight, the cocked arm, the ball over the head, the knuckles at the hairline  thats todays classic jump shot, Christgau said in an interview. It was unblockable.That view was echoed by Jerry Krause, the research chairman of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. His own study, he told CBSSports.com last year, led him to conclude that Sailors was the first player to develop and use the shot consistently.Basketball eminences have also given Sailors their vote. Joe Lapchick, a former pro basketball star and coach, wrote in 1965, Sailors started the one-handed jumper, which is probably the shot of the present and the future. And Ray Meyer, the venerated former coach of DePaul University, assured Sailors in a handwritten letter, You were the first I saw with the true jump shot as we know it today.Kenneth Lloyd Sailors was born on Jan. 14, 1921, in Bushnell, Neb.  population 124  to Edward Sailors and the former Cora Belle Houtz. His mother had gone west in a covered wagon and grown up in a sod house. She gave birth to Kenny by herself.The boys parents divorced when they were young, and Kenny and Bud  Barton on his birth certificate  were reared by their mother on a 320-acre farm outside Hillsdale, a stockyard town in southeastern Wyoming. An older sister, Gladys, had married and left home.The boys helped keep the farm going through the Depression, driving to Cheyenne, the state capital, to sell potatoes, bantam sweet corn and chickens. One year they raised hogs, butchered them and sold the meat door to door from a trailer hitched to an old Chevrolet. As they headed for school in the morning, the boys would see their mother out in the fields, and when they came home in the afternoon, they would see her there still.The brothers historic game of one-on-one remained vivid in Kenny Sailorss memory.The good Lord must have put in my mind that if Im going to get up over this big bum so I can shoot, Im going to have to jump, he said in an interview on NPR in 2008. It probably wasnt pretty, but I got the shot off, and it went in. And boy, Bud says: Youd better develop that. Thats going to be a good shot. So I started working on it.Bud was an all-stater, and when he received a basketball scholarship from the University of Wyoming in Laramie, his mother sold the farm, pulled Kenny out of high school and moved there, too, opening a boardinghouse. Kenny became a champion miler and long jumper and a basketball star at Laramie High School, building leg power that would eventually give him, by his measure, a 36-inch vertical lift  an invaluable asset for a 5-foot-10 point guard.The jump shot puzzled the Laramie coach, Floyd Foreman. Whered you get that queer shot? Sailors recalled him asking.Sailors led the Laramie Plainsmen to a state championship and followed his brother to the University of Wyoming, also on a scholarship. (Early on he was a teammate of the future sports broadcaster Curt Gowdy.) He soon had sportswriters groping to describe his jump shot. A shot-put throw, one wrote.Chester Nelson, a sportswriter for The Rocky Mountain News in Colorado known as Red, wrote of Sailors in 1943: His dribble is a sight to behold. He can leap with a mighty spring and get off that dazzling one-handed shot. Master Kenneth Sailors is one of the handiest hardwood artists ever to trod the boards.In the 1942-43 season, under Coach Everett Shelton, Sailors led the team to a 31-2 record and a championship, with a 46-34 victory over Georgetown at Madison Square Garden. He was chosen the N.C.A.A. tournaments most outstanding player.His ability to dribble through and around any type of defense was uncanny, just as was his electrifying one-handed shot, The New York Times wrote.Wyoming was anointed the nations best college team after it defeated St. Johns University, the National Invitation Tournament champion, by 52-47 in overtime in a Red Cross fund-raising exhibition at the Garden on April 1, 1943. The dynamic Ken Sailors, as The Times put it, led the way again.That year he married Marilynne Corbin, a cheerleader nicknamed Bokie, and then enlisted in the Marines and served in the South Pacific, where Bud was flying B-25 bombers.Discharged in 1945 with captains bars, Sailors, with a year of eligibility left, rejoined the Wyoming team midseason and led it to a 22-4 record, earning his third all-American honor and a contract with the Cleveland Rebels of the Basketball Association of America.The jump shot was still alien to the pros, and the Rebels coach, Dutch Dehnert, was skeptical. Youll never go in this league with that shot, he told Sailors before benching him.But Dehnert was soon gone in a coaching change, and Sailors, with his jump shot, returned to the lineup.Professional stardom eluded him, though. In three seasons in the B.A.A. and two in its successor, the National Basketball Association, Sailors played mostly on losing teams, like the Providence Steamrollers in Rhode Island (where he signed an endorsement deal with Bennetts Prune Juice, receiving all-you-can-drink cases of it as a bonus).He led the first incarnation of the Denver Nuggets in scoring one year and exploded for 37 points in a game with the Baltimore Bullets. He retired from professional basketball at 30.Sailors later bought a dude ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyo. A Republican, he served a term in the Wyoming Legislature and lost bids for the United States House of Representatives and the Senate.With their children grown, Sailors and his wife sold the ranch to his brother in 1965, packed up and drove to Alaska, living at first in an Airstream trailer. They stayed for more than 30 years, moving to a log cabin overlooking the Copper River and then to a Tlingit village on Admiralty Island.Sailors led hunting and fishing expeditions, coached youth basketball and taught high school history. After Marilynne Sailors developed Alzheimers disease, the couple moved to Idaho, following their daughter Linda, who had married.Sailorss wife died in 2002 after 59 years of marriage, and Linda Sailors Money died in 2012. Another daughter, Carie, died when she was 5.Sailorss death, in an assisted living center, was announced by the University of Wyoming. He is survived by a son, Dan, as well as eight grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.After his wifes death, Sailors moved back to Laramie and settled near the university as a living campus legend. Plans were afoot to erect a statue of him at the basketball arenas entrance.To the disappointment of his fans, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., never inducted him. But the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame did, in 2012, in a class that also included Patrick Ewing. Sailors joined Shelton, his coach at Wyoming, among the enshrined.Days afterward, Wyoming honored Sailors with a halftime ceremony during a game against Colorado. Overhead was a Gulliver-size Cowboys jersey hanging from the roof, its downy white trimmed in brown and gold and bearing Sailorss name and number, 4. It remains the only jersey suspended there, high above the court."}
{"text": "For years, one of the main criticisms of beer advertising was that it tended to either objectify women or disregard them entirely. Marketers seemed to be too busy trying to appeal to the young male audience they knew would consistently drink beer by the case to worry about anyone else.Now, that appears to be changing.Allen Adamson, the former chairman of the brand consulting firm Landor Associates, said the fraternity house imagery and sophomoric humor that long defined many beer campaigns has come under siege, led by millennials who are more conscientious about male chauvinism.With more consumers switching to craft beers  which grew to 10.7 percent of the dollar share in 2015, according to Nielsen  and beers already having lost 10 percentage points of its volume share to wine and spirits since 2002, the major labels have had to refocus their efforts, Mr. Adamson said.It was fine to show a frat party making fun of girls five or eight years ago, Mr. Adamson said. But its ineffective and potentially damaging to do today.On Sunday, Coors Light, the second-best-selling domestic beer, after Bud Light, unveiled a new campaign that it hopes will appeal to women in a way its past advertising has not. The campaign, which is called Climb On, features enough shots of climbers atop Rocky Mountain peaks to make sure nobody forgets the particulars of the Coors brand. But sprinkled among images of rugged bull riders and boxers are some of women scaling walls, running races and white-water rafting. The narrator asks, What would we be without our mountains?  a tagline intended to evoke a sense of empowerment that the company believes women will respond to more than, say, former pitchmen like the football coach Mike Ditka.The new campaign arrives after Ipsos, the market research firm, said that women consumed more than 17 billion servings of beer in 2014, or 25 percent of the volume of the category  up from around 20 percent in previous estimates, and equal to the amount of beer that millennial males drank that year.The number astounded David Kroll, who became chief marketing officer at MillerCoors in July.Disappointing, Mr. Kroll said in an interview, that we werent speaking to women.This became painfully obvious last spring, when Bud Lights Up for Whatever campaign was criticized for the tagline The perfect beer for removing no from your vocabulary for the night, which some people took as an endorsement of date rape. The company soon apologized and stopped printing the slogan on its labels.That was a pivot point, Mr. Adamson said.The Climb On commercials, produced by the ad agency 72andSunny, which has worked with companies like Target, Google and Samsung, are part of what Mr. Kroll described as a modernizing effort by the Coors Brewing Company. That effort is meant to better align the company with the interests of millennials, who are more sensitive than previous generations to marketing that might be considered sexist or chauvinistic, he said.The thought of being fully inclusive to women, when you speak to millennials, theyre like, Yeah, duh, Mr. Kroll said. In some respects, beer is just catching up to the millennial mind-set.Coors Light is not alone in this effort. Heineken has recently appealed to moderate drinkers with a new ad that suggests modern women will be more attracted to men who drink less. The latest commercial, one of three since the campaign began in 2011, features women singing the Bonnie Tyler song I Need a Hero as they walk away from ostensibly inebriated men.Some brands have also introduced new products to attract women in recent years, though results have been mixed. In 2011, for instance, Molson Coors introduced a bloat resistant beer called Anime that came in different flavors and colors, while the Carlsberg Group created a gender-neutral beer called Copenhagen with a minimalist aesthetic that resembled a sleek bottle of white wine. Both were short-lived.Anheuser-Busch, on the other hand, has had some success with its fruit-tasting Bud Light Lime Rita range since 2012. Hard ciders grew 13 percent in 2015, while other flavored malt beverages gained 10 percent, according to Nielsen.When it comes to gender-neutral advertising, though, the brand consultant Dean Crutchfield says that Coors Light, which has long sought to portray a robust masculinity in its marketing, is taking a considerable risk.If you alienate your core, your credibility and relevance tumbles, Mr. Crutchfield said. Its about your brand, your heritage, your past and your future. Its been all wrapped around the males. To suddenly unwrap that, it does carry risk.Britt Dougherty, MillerCoorss senior director of marketing insights, says that women rarely self-identify as beer drinkers, and that beer companies have not done a good job trying to recruit them. According to Ms. Doughertys estimates, a more gender-friendly advertising approach could add from five million to nine million barrels to the industrys sales in the United States over the next five years.It takes time to undo that baggage, she said. Weve represented a version of masculinity that wasnt appealing to women.Also figuring into Coorss calculus is a Brewers Association estimate that women consumed 30 percent of the craft beer on the market in 2014. And Nielsen says craft beers market penetration in off-premise, or in-home, consumption continues to increase, rising half a percentage point from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015.Jackie Dodd, who runs the popular cooking and beer blog The Beeroness, said she felt that craft beers, or microbrews, had always been about community and collaboration, including male and female brewers.I dont think craft beer ever marketed towards women, they just valued them and that conveyed, Ms. Dodd wrote in an email. Im not sure macro can do that, or even knows how. But if they can, more power to them."}

So they enlisted their longtime collaborator, the German filmmaker Alexa Karolinski, and gathered cast members like the artists Alex Chaves and Math Bass, the architect Miggi Hood and the conceptual entrepreneur Martine Syms (all dressed in Eckhaus Lattas spring/summer collection) at the midcentury Modernist Kappe residence. The motley group assumed a series of family-portrait-like poses and Karolinski let the camera linger as the characters moods shifted and captured a manic energy that is a bit more honest than incredibly stoic or fierce, said Latta, referring to usual advertising tropes.It was a nice way for us to reconsider the collection  after weve had time to look at the clothing for a period of months, compared to a live show, where its really us experiencing the collection for the first time as the public does, Eckhaus notes.

{"text": "DAVENPORT, Iowa   A former paid organizer for Donald J. Trump who was fired this month has accused his presidential campaign of sex discrimination.Elizabeth Mae Davidson, 26, who was the Trump campaigns field organizer here in Davenport, Iowas third-largest city, said in a discrimination complaint that men doing the same jobs were paid more and were allowed to plan and speak at rallies, while her requests to do so were ignored. She also said that when she and a young female volunteer met Mr. Trump at a rally last summer, he told them, You guys could do a lot of damage, referring to their looks.The complaint was filed on Thursday with the Davenport Civil Rights Commission.In a telephone interview on Sunday, Mr. Trump denied making the remark but did not address the other two allegations.That is not the worst thing that could be said, Mr. Trump said. But I never said it. Its not in my vocabulary.He added that he did not know Ms. Davidson but that in checking with his staff, he was told she was a disgruntled employee. My people tell me she did a terrible job.He criticized The New York Times for reporting the complaint the day before the caucuses, adding, A story like this could damage my chances.Ms. Davidson, of Bettendorf, had recruited organizers for most of her regions 63 precincts and had opened a field office, only the second in the state. She was fired on Jan. 14, the day after a Times article portrayed problems with the campaigns senior Iowa leadership, to whom she reported.In her complaint, Ms. Davidson wrote that she was told she was fired for making disparaging comments about senior campaign leaders to third parties and breaking a nondisclosure clause in her employment contract. She denied saying anything disparaging about campaign leaders to the news media.Ms. Davidson was described in The Times article as being one of the campaigns most effective organizers and was quoted as she tried to enlist volunteers during a Trump rally in Ottumwa on Jan. 9. Elsewhere in the article, the campaign was described as amateurish and halting, committing basic organizing errors.Ms. Davidsons complaint states that men with the same job title  district representatives  were quoted in news accounts without being fired. It says she was the only woman with that title and that men with the same title were paid more.In an interview, Ms. Davidson said she was paid $2,000 a month and was classified as part-time because she also had a job as a paralegal. But she said another district representative, Marc Elcock, was paid more though he, too, has a day job, as a lawyer.According to public filings, several men who held the same title, including Mr. Elcock, were paid $3,500 to $4,000 a month.The complaint says Mr. Trumps suggestion that Ms. Davidson and a female volunteer could do a lot of damage occurred when they were introduced to him last summer. It included no other details about the exchange.Ms. Davidsons lawyer, Dorothy A. OBrien, said the complaint would trigger an investigation by the Davenport civil rights agency.Ms. Davidson, the daughter of the Republican chairwoman of Scott County, said in an interview last summer that she had first met Mr. Trump when he visited Davenport in early 2015, before he announced his candidacy."}

All-Star Game by voting him captain of the Pacific Division.Then they made him tournament most valuable player.Scott scored twice during the leagues new three-on-three All-Star tournament, bringing cheers from fans and smiles from teammates, and was named M.V.P. as a write-in candidate after leading the Pacific to a 1-0 win in the championship on Sunday night.Scott, a 6-foot-8 forward with five goals in 285 career N.H.L. games, was not listed among the three M.V.P. candidates for a Twitter vote late in the final game, but fans took it upon themselves to select him again.Im sure he won over a lot of people and got even more fans, Chicago forward Patrick Kane said of Scott.Fans at Bridgestone Arena booed the M.V.P. options and yelled for Scott. Teammates lifted him on their shoulders while fans chanted M.V.P.! Then Scott was announced as the winner and presented with a sport utility vehicle. Scott then posed with his teammates behind their $1 million check.I think its the best possible outcome, right? Scott said. We had a good weekend.He added, We left winning, so it was great.The N.H.L. changed the format after last years All-Star Game featured 92 shots and a combined 29 goals for the biggest offensive display in the showcases 60-year history. This year, the All-Stars combined for 116 shots and 23 goals.Sundays event looked much more like the hockey the league plays the rest of the season. The inspiration was the three-on-three overtime approach for a tournament pitting the four divisions against one another in 20-minute games. The winners of the first two games advanced to a third-period championship.I broke a better sweat than last year for sure, said Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux, who played for the Metropolitan Division.Goalies split the work with a 10-minute portion each and actually got the chance to stop shots rather than be targets in the net. The Panthers Roberto Luongo and the Kings Jonathan Quick each made great saves to keep the first 10 minutes of the championship game scoreless, and Quick stopped Florida forward Jaromir Jagr in the final seconds before intermission.Scott, the personable career enforcer who is now a minor leaguer, stole the show.A fan campaign made Scott captain of the Pacific Division before the Arizona Coyotes traded him Jan. 15 to Montreal, which assigned him to the American Hockey League.Scott will return to Newfoundland in Canada with a lot of prizes after fans took it upon themselves to vote him over the three finalists offered by the leagues hockey operations: Luongo; Calgary forward Johnny Gaudreau; and Edmonton forward Taylor Hall.Anaheim forward Corey Perry scored the lone goal in the championship at 13 minutes 38 seconds.Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang blocked a shot, and Montreal defenseman P. K. Subban sprawled out on the ice to help protect a lead in the final seconds of the Atlantic Divisions 4-3 win over the Metropolitan. Tampa Bay goalie Ben Bishop stopped shots by Letang and his Penguins teammate Evgeni Malkin inside the final minute to preserve the win.Goalies also got into the offensive action, taking advantage of more room on the ice. Corey Schneider of the Devils, Nashvilles Pekka Rinne, Bishop and Anaheims John Gibson each had assists.Jagr, the captain of the Atlantic Division, who turns 44 on Feb. 15, skated in his 10th All-Star Game.

{"text": "The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless. \nPhotoCredit ngel Franco/The New York TimesIve been teaching philosophy for 15 years, and while Ive had some very memorable experiences along the way, I knew early on that my current seminar would be unique. The course itself is on values, and each Monday for nearly three hours my students debate  in an often lively and engaging manner  issues ranging from the existence of universal moral truths to the permissibility of torture and the death penalty. In fact, a few weeks ago, there was a complaint about the level of noise coming from my classroom. The reason for the noise? The utilitarians were rather loudly arguing to the Kantians that sacrificing one of their classmates to prevent the Paris attacks would clearly have been justified.The complaint resulted in a guard being stationed in the doorway of my classroom to ensure that there wasnt a security threat, followed by some breath-holding as I waited to see if I would, once again, be removed from the building. You see, the course Im teaching is at Stateville Correctional Center  a maximum-security mens prison in a suburb of Chicago  where raised voices arent typically the result of intense philosophical debate about normative ethical theories. Yet, the room felt no more in need of a guard than do my classes at Northwestern.In some respects, this is a striking fact. Just about all of my students at Stateville have been convicted of at least one murder; some have assaulted staff members, and others have spent over a decade in solitary confinement. Some are former gang members, and others were on death row  neighbors with John Wayne Gacy  for almost half of their lives.In other respects, however, this is not at all surprising. The most obvious is that some end up at Stateville for reasons that are disconnected from culpability  coerced confessions, poor counsel, a racist jury, and so on. But even where these external forces are largely absent, the fact that my classroom seems indistinguishable from those at an elite university turns out not to be that shocking. And heres the simple, yet crucially important reason: People can change, often in profoundly transformative ways.Such transformations can be seen most clearly by considering the two ends of the spectrum of life. On the early side, it is often noted that the prefrontal cortex of the brains of adolescents is still developing, and so they are more likely than adults to act on impulse, engage in dangerous or risky behavior, and misread social cues and emotions. This raises a host of questions about the level of responsibility that juveniles bear for their crimes and the appropriate punishments that should be handed out to them. If the underdeveloped brains of adolescents at least partly explain their criminal behavior, then holding them fully responsible for their actions, and punishing them as adults, seems wildly off the mark.On the later side of the spectrum, only 1 percent of serious crime is committed by people over the age of 60. According to Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University: Everyone agrees on what is the most reliable predictor of recidivism: age. As people get older, they statistically become less dangerous. Turley refers to this period as criminal menopause, a phenomenon that raises serious questions about the rationale for incarcerating the elderly. Still, researchers project that the elderly prison population in the United States will be over 400,000 in 2030, compared with 8,853 in 1981.At the early end of the spectrum of life, then, there is the possibility that prisoners might change; at the later end, there is the reality that they have changed. Both facts bump up against natural life sentences. A sentence of natural life means that there are no parole hearings, no credit for time served, no possibility of release. Short of a successful appeal or an executive pardon, such a sentence means that the convicted will, in no uncertain terms, die behind bars.Many types of arguments have been leveled against natural life sentences. Economic ones focus on the ballooning costs of mass incarceration and the toll this takes on government budgets, especially as the age and medical expenses of prisoners rapidly increase. Legal ones ask whether such sentences are cruel and unusual and therefore violate the Eighth Amendment, particularly for juveniles. Social arguments ask whether natural life sentences discourage reform by providing no incentive for rehabilitation. Moral concerns are grounded in the dignity and rights of prisoners, while psychological objections call attention to the myriad causes of deviant behavior and their responsiveness to appropriate treatment.But one argument that is surprisingly absent from these conversations is an epistemic one that has to do with us. For natural life sentences say to all involved that there is no possible piece of information that could be learned between sentencing and death that could bear in any way on the punishment the convicted is said to deserve, short of what might ground an appeal. Nothing. So no matter how much a juvenile is transformed behind bars, and no matter how unrecognizable an elderly prisoner is from his earlier self, this is utterly irrelevant to whether they should be incarcerated. Our absence of knowledge about the future, our ignorance of what is to come, our lack of a crystal ball, is in no way a barrier to determining now what someones life ought to be like decades from now.Moreover, prisoners arent the only ones who can change: victims and their families can come to see the convicted as being worthy of forgiveness and a second chance, and public attitudes can evolve, moving away from a zealous war on crime approach to one that sees much criminal activity as the result of broader social problems that call for reform. Even if we set aside the other arguments against natural life sentences  economic, legal, moral and so on  the question I want to ask here is this: how is it rational to screen off the relevance of this information? How, that is, is it rational to say today that there can be no possible evidence in the future that could bear on the punishment that a decades-from-now prisoner deserves?In any other domain, it would obviously be irrational to make a high-stakes decision about the rest of another persons life that not only rules out the possibility of ever considering additional evidence, but is also meant to be absolutely final.If I were given the option to heavily invest in one, and only one, career for my 15-year-old based only on her current beliefs, preferences, and character, I would refuse without hesitation. A lot can change in a decade, especially during the critical transition between adolescence and adulthood. Even choices that we expect to significantly constrain our future selves, such as marriage, can be revisited in light of new evidence. This is precisely why divorce is legal. Yet natural life sentences stand out as a glaring exception: They permit binding, life-altering decisions to be made in a state of radical epistemic impoverishment.Of course, when punishment is connected with rehabilitation, its undeniable that information about changes, especially among prisoners, is relevant. But this is also true for all but the crudest forms of retributive justice. Its a commonplace that information about a persons mental states bears on the punishment deserved, regardless of its consequences. When considering punishments, including at parole hearings, we are often highly sensitive to whether the wrongdoer appreciates the wrongness of the act, feels remorse, and is committed to not being a repeat offender.Compare two students known to have cheated: The first fully acknowledges that looking at her notes during an exam was wrong, is clearly contrite, and promises to never do so again; the second flagrantly and steadfastly lies about it and shows no evidence that he wont cheat again. It is fairly standard for the second students punishment to be harsher than the firsts.An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.But if we take two students with such different mental states regarding cheating as deserving of different sanctions, why would we not regard two stages of the same person  one at 19 and another at 49  with radically different attitudes toward his crime, as deserving of different punishments? Current selves and future selves can vary from one another no less than two altogether distinct people do.Notice that nothing in the epistemic argument here suggests that no prisoners should, in fact, spend the rest of their natural lives behind bars. Instead, the point is that rationality requires that we leave the epistemic door open to acquiring new information. Put bluntly, the argument says that it is irrational for the possibility of parole to be taken off the table at the outset of any sentence.If Hume is right that a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence, then our beliefs about the punishment a person deserves at any given time need to be sensitive to the evidence available at that time. But if we screen off huge amounts of potentially relevant information decades before the beliefs about what a prisoner deserves are even formed, then it is impossible for them to be proportioned to the evidence.Nearly all of my students at Stateville are serving natural life sentences. At least a handful of them have been incarcerated since they were teenagers, one since he was 14. While I didnt know any of their decades-earlier selves, their current selves are some of the most extraordinary students Ive had in my 15 years of teaching. They are painters and poets, mentors and authors, researchers and advocates. They breathe new life into philosophical questions Ive been asking for the entirety of my career. And yet we tell these men that who they are now and what they have accomplished matters so little to how they ought to be treated that we wont even bother to consider it. Rationality demands that we do better.Jennifer Lackey is a professor philosophy at Northwestern University.Now in print: The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments, An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and on Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter."}
{"text": "WHEN President Obama proclaimed in his State of the Union address last month that solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, he clearly wasnt talking about Nevada.In late December, the states Public Utilities Commission, which regulates Nevadas energy market, announced a rate change drastic enough to kill Nevadas booming rooftop solar market and drive providers out of the state. Effective Jan. 1, the new tariffs will gradually increase until they triple monthly fees that solar users pay to use the electric grid and cut by three-quarters users reimbursements for feeding electricity into it.More startlingly, the commission made its decision retroactive. That means that the 17,000 Nevada residents who were lured into solar purchases by state-mandated one-time rebates of up to $23,000 suddenly discovered that they were victims of a bait-and-switch. They made the deals assuming that, allowing for inflation, their rates would stay constant over their contracts 20- to 30-year lifetimes; instead, they face the prospect of paying much more for electricity than if they had never made the change, even though theyre generating almost all their electricity themselves.The commission justified its decision by citing grid construction and maintenance costs that rooftop solar users havent been charged for, but circumstantial evidence suggests that other factors played a role. All three commission members were appointed or reappointed by Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, whose two election campaigns have received a total of $20,000, the maximum allowed donation under Nevada law, from NV Energy, the Berkshire Hathaway-owned utility that is a major beneficiary of the rate changes. Two of Mr. Sandovals closest informal advisers, Pete Ernaut and Gregory W. Ferraro, are NV Energy lobbyists.The American Legislative Exchange Council, which drafts model bills for right-wing state legislators and receives financial support from fossil fuel interests, has campaigned for rates like those the commission adopted, and, according to Greenpeace, NV Energy was at one time an ALEC member.The outcry among solar users and providers has been so vehement that the commission has agreed to hold a hearing next week to reconsider imposing the new rates on existing solar users, and NV Energy announced a week ago that it would not insist on the retroactive provision. But even if limited to future customers, the rate changes will almost certainly decimate one of the largest residential solar markets in the nation. As a result, residential consumers will have little alternative to NV Energy, which uses fossil fuels to generate more than 80 percent of the states electricity.The decision is likely to have national repercussions. One indication is that the stock price of SolarCity, which served 60 percent of Nevadas rooftop market, has dropped 30 percent since the commissions decision was announced Dec. 22. Investors in solar companies now have reason to fear that retroactive provisions will spread to other states, no matter what happens in Nevada.All of this amounts to the most consequential skirmish so far in the struggle over the future of utilities. In fact, it reflects utilities defensiveness, as modular devices located close to consumers are undermining their monopolies. Cleaner, more energy-efficient and potentially cheaper than fossil fuels, these technologies include solar, wind, batteries, microturbines, microgrids and smart appliances. As they spread, they strike at the heart of utilities business models: To increase profits, utilities must expand operations, but the emergence of distributed energy reduces the need for expansion.Three years ago, the Edison Electric Institute, the utilities trade group, published a report called Disruptive Challenges that became famous in the utilities sector for its seeming candor. It describes how distributed forms of energy could send the industry into what has become known as the utility death spiral. As more and more consumers switch to distributed energy, the utilities costs must be shared among a dwindling number of customers, whose rates therefore increase, causing more of them to shift to distributed energy. The report may be exaggerating when it says that if 10 percent of utility customers switch to distributed energy, utilities rates would rise by 20 percent, but even a smaller shift might devastate utilities business models.The industrys response has been to try to protect its revenue stream by limiting the growth of rooftop solar, in particular by claiming that solar users benefit from the grids existence without paying for it, as the utilities ratepayers do. The Nevada commissions decision relied on an NV Energy study that made this argument. But solar users also save utilities money in assorted ways, including by reducing the amount of energy utilities must generate or buy from conventional power plants, lowering utilities need for large capital investments and increasing the grids resilience. Numerous studies suggest that rooftop solars impact on the grid is at best beneficial, at worst slightly negative  in either case, not a justification for substantially raising solar users rates.Both utilities and their regulators are well known for their caution and lack of vision, but the utilities current strategy is outdated and unsustainable. Not only does it waste resources and stifle innovation, but its likely to be upended by a few pioneering state commissions that understand the overwhelming economic and environmental value of distributed energy.Most notably, in April 2014, New Yorks Public Service Commission began a process to transform utilities from monopolies into electricity distributors that increasingly rely on clean energy generated by numerous providers. In this grid of the future, energy costs will decrease and utilities will become, instead of climate change enablers, part of the solution to the problem."}
{"text": "DES MOINES   They have munched on pork chops in the heat of summer and hunted game in the dead of winter. Spouses and children have been dispatched as surrogates across the plains. But with the caucuses on Monday hours away, the presidential candidates are leaving nothing to chance, furiously crisscrossing Iowa and making direct appeals to voters to stand for them in the elections first nominating contest.The campaigns are activating the final stage of their ground games, which they have spent months, in some cases years, building in the hope that a victory or a strong showing will give them momentum for the next round of contests. With a winter storm expected to bring snow to the state late Monday, operatives will be monitoring the forecast out of fear that bad weather could reduce turnout.On Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas implored his supporters to caucus as he closed out his Iowa campaign with events in Iowa City, Davenport and Des Moines. He was accompanied for part of the day by the talk show host Glenn Beck and Phil Robertson of the television series Duck Dynasty. After a service at a nondenominational church in Council Bluffs, Donald J. Trump continued his courtship of evangelical Christian voters, urging them to have faith in his candidacy during two rallies with Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, who has endorsed him.Hillary Clinton was not far away, making two stops in western Iowa as she looked to avoid an upset at the hands of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Sanders held four rallies, traveling from Waterloo to Marshalltown to Ames before capping the day with a MoveOn.org event at Grand View University in Des Moines. And several of the leading candidates will hold rallies Monday in a last-ditch effort to draw voters out later in the day.The candidates were confronting not only worrisome weather forecasts, but also an unsettled electorate that has not produced a clear favorite in either race. A closely watched poll by The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics released on Saturday showed Mr. Trump holding a slim lead over Mr. Cruz on the Republican side, and Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders deadlocked in the Democratic race. For flagging candidates like Jeb Bush or Ben Carson, talk of beating the odds or of pulling off an Iowa surprise has crept into the stump speeches of campaigns that were once filled with promise.You can defy the pundits, Mr. Bush, who will head to New Hampshire on caucus day, said at an event in Dubuque on Saturday night. I trust you, and I hope you get involved and I hope you participate in the caucuses, and of course I hope you caucus for me.Mr. Cruz, who perhaps has the most at stake in Iowa, has been canvassing the state aggressively and visiting all 99 counties to complete the full Grassley, named after Senator Charles E. Grassleys annual tour of his state. On the campaign trail, Mr. Cruz has urged his supporters to bring like-minded friends, family members and colleagues to caucus.I want to ask every one of you here to vote for me 10 times, Mr. Cruz said on Sunday at the Johnson County Fairgrounds in Iowa City. Now, look, were not Democrats. Im not suggesting voter fraud. But if every one of you brings nine other people to the caucus tomorrow night, you will have voted 10 times.Mr. Cruz has also employed more subversive strategies to get out the vote, and has even raised eyebrows among state officials. Iowas Republican secretary of state accused Mr. Cruz on Saturday of using unethical campaign tactics by distributing mailers warning people that they would be committing a voting violation if they failed to caucus.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has quietly built momentum in Iowa in recent weeks, and if he manages a strong third-place showing it could be because of his campaigns efforts to persuade people who have come to his rallies across the state to pledge their support and caucus. Volunteers pass out glossy, colorful cards that read I commit to caucus for Marco! and take voters names, phone numbers, and email and home addresses  information the campaign uses to follow up with them.A team of field staff members works the room at each event, trying to get as many people as possible to fill out the cards, which are then shipped back to headquarters, where teams of volunteers and staff members call to follow up. The goal, the campaign said, is to reach each person three times by caucus day and to make sure everyone knows where to go; when to be there; and, of course, to caucus for Mr. Rubio.Lately the campaign has reported growing numbers of people agreeing to commit at its events, with sometimes more than half the attendees pledging to caucus for Mr. Rubio.In addition to the staff members and volunteers the Rubio campaign has on the ground across Iowa, Mr. Rubio has recruited a group of 14 members of Congress who will appear at caucus sites on Monday night and pitch his message directly to voters. Mr. Rubio also plans to visit three caucus sites that evening to make an appeal in person.The wild card on the Republican side remains Mr. Trump. Facing his first election, his organizational prowess is an open question, and doubts about the professionalism of his Iowa operation have lingered over his campaign.Mr. Trumps team does have talent in the state. His top operative is Chuck Laudner, who helped orchestrate Rick Santorums victory in the 2012 Republican caucuses. And there have been signs that a serious effort is being made to turn Mr. Trumps big campaign rallies, filled with political newcomers, into concrete support.Staff members have been busy distributing fliers detailing how people can register to vote, how they can switch to the Republican Party and reassuring them that the ballots for Republicans are secret, in contrast to the open system used by Democrats. Mr. Trump has been spotted handing out such information at his events as he coaxes voters to help him win.The final weekend before the caucuses was not short on showmanship from Mr. Trump, who descended on Dubuques tiny regional airport to presidential music on Saturday and invited children to play on his private jet. With the storm bearing down, Mr. Trump issued a challenge to his supporters: Are you afraid of the snow?Democrats are also intensifying their efforts to secure support. As Mrs. Clinton kicked off a rally at a packed high school gymnasium on Saturday night, text messages lit up the smartphones of people who had shared their contact information with her campaign. They were prompted to open and share a graphic with information about where to caucus.Joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, Mrs. Clinton made a closing argument that included a warning of a dark future facing the United States if a Republican won the White House.The reason it is so important that you turn out on Monday night is because of what could happen if you dont, Mrs. Clinton said, listing the conservative policies that Republicans want to impose. I want you all to know that Im going to fight against them.As Mrs. Clinton campaigned on Sunday, questions surrounding her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state persisted. In an interview with ABCs This Week program, she said the controversy was unlikely to subside anytime soon.This is very much like Benghazi, she said. You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it to beat up on me.Meanwhile, Mrs. Clintons opponent for the Democratic nomination was not letting up. Driving record turnout will be crucial to Mr. Sanderss fortunes in Iowa, and volunteers spent the final weekend before the caucuses milling in and out of his state campaign headquarters. Fueled by pizza and breath mints, they have frantically been making phone calls and planning to knock on more doors.Like many of the campaigns, Mr. Sanderss team has developed a caucus-specific website, where voters can input their addresses and find the location, time and turn-by-turn directions for their caucus sites.Popular culture is also a tool. The band Vampire Weekend headlined a concert and rally for Mr. Sanders in Iowa City on Saturday night. Mr. Sanders, who once sang on a folk album, joined the band and others onstage to sing a rendition of This Land Is Your Land.Embracing the underdog role, Mr. Sanders urged young people to turn out at the caucuses in order to give him a shot on Monday and to make the pundits look dumb."}

{"text": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are locked in an intense, occasionally nasty, policy battle  a fight finally being put to its first voter test today in Iowa. One advocates a single-payer health care system (Mr. Sanders), the other is attacking his plan to make it a reality (Mrs. Clinton). One refuses to raise taxes on the middle class (Mrs. Clinton), the other is O.K. with doing so in order to fund certain programs (Mr. Sanders). Mrs. Clinton is hammering her opponent over his previous milquetoast support for gun control measures. Mr. Sanders claims Mrs. Clinton doesnt go far enough on Wall Street reform.These are substantive, important differences. Democrats havent finished the debate over whether, and how, the country should have a government-funded health care system, for instance.But the largest difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders is not over policy. (I should note that my spouse works on the technology team for the Clinton campaign, but is not involved in policy.) There is scant daylight between them on most issues and certainly almost all of the causes near and dear to Democrats and progressives hearts. The largest difference, and therefore what the Democratic Party is truly grappling with, is not about two different visions of the party. The choice is between two theories of change. Its the difference between working the system and smashing it.Mr. Sanders is promising to get a lot done: tuition-free college, breaking up the largest banks, health care for all, a $15 minimum wage, even guaranteed vacation time. None of these ideas have much salience among Republican lawmakers, and he doesnt appear to be the kind of messenger who might inspire them to give in.But these arent just empty postures for Mr. Sanders. He promises that as president he would bring them about through what hes calling political revolution. The idea is that his campaign will be so inspirational to voters, particularly young people and others who might not otherwise vote, that they will not just sweep him into office. Theyll vote out intransigent Republicans and usher in a wave of legislators who will help enact his agenda. The only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together, he explained at the first Democratic debate in October.He also promises to get things done because he is relying mostly on small-dollar contributions, so he wouldnt be beholden to the moneyed interests that he believes are poisoning the current political system. In his view, its so corrupt that it basically needs to be scrapped for something better. I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution, he said at that first debate.He made this even clearer in the most recent debate, claiming that the problem is not that Republicans and Democrats hate each other, which he says is a myth. The real issue, he says, is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.Mr. Sanders is reacting to a reality: Researchers have found that when the wealthy or organized interest groups  like banks or pharmaceutical companies  support a particular policy, theres a strong likelihood that they will get their way. But when average citizens support something, they wield virtually no influence over lawmakers. Plenty of other studies have also found that government is far more attuned to the desires of the rich than those of the poor or middle class.Still, Mr. Sanderss revolution is somewhat far-fetched. Republicans currently control both houses of Congress, and Democrats chances of retaking both are pretty narrow. It would require an enormous mobilization to usher veto-proof majorities into both bodies. And even if that did happen, there is no guarantee that those majorities would all agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Sanders.If Mr. Sanders embodies idealism, then Mrs. Clinton is pragmatism incarnate. Mrs. Clintons message of how to get things done takes the lessons of President Obamas eight years in office  that Republicans will mostly unite against anything, even policies that they once supported  and, rather than change the system, she promises to work it. At the same early debate where Mr. Sanders explained his revolution, Mrs. Clinton was asked if she was a progressive. Im a progressive, she responded. But Im a progressive who likes to get things done.Part of that is continuing Mr. Obamas practice, most evident in his second term, of calling for Congress to pass legislation while taking executive action when Congress stalls. On issues ranging from gun control to marijuana regulation to corporate tax policy, she has released policies that she would like to see enacted alongside outlines of executive action she would take on her own without Congress.This approach is also reacting to a truth: The Republicans who control Congress have made a dramatic shift rightward. The body is extremely polarized, and according to some analysis, the G.O.P. is more conservative than it has been in a century. Its all but inevitable that on the big policies that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders agree the country needs to enact, a Republican-controlled Congress  or even one with partial Republican control  wont lift a finger to help pass sweeping legislation. In its place, Mrs. Clinton promises to at least notch small victories on her own.Executive action, though, comes with risks: What one president puts in place the next can undo, as can the courts. And focusing on the incrementally doable and pragmatic can mean losing sight of what might someday be possible. If a politician is too afraid to push for what she truly believes should happen, because its impractical, she wont pry open the window of what could become be perfectly acceptable. Whats radical today can lose its edge the more it leaks into political discourse. But first it has to be leaked.Here is a partial list of the policies that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders largely agree on: The country should have paid family leave; the minimum wage should be substantially increased; college students shouldnt have to take on so much debt; parents need more affordable, quality child care and preschool options; Wall Street needs further reforms; health care should be universal; the wealthy should pay substantially more in taxes. Many of these are new policies even for Democratic presidential candidates. Despite using the socialist label, Mr. Sanders sounds a lot like many prominent Democrats. Mrs. Clinton is a tried and true liberal.The true contrasts are between what they want and whats being proposed among Republicans, who want to hand tax cuts to the wealthy, repeal the Affordable Care Act and block most of what Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders support. Once the general election campaign begins, it will truly be a choice between clashing worldviews. Until then, Democratic primary voters are deciding between two theories of how to get things done."}

We jumped it for today, so we can celebrate with dinner tonight.Dwyane Wade and Luol Deng each scored 17 points for Miami (27-21), which never trailed and passed Atlanta (27-22) for first place in the Southeast Division. Miami moved ahead of Boston (27-22) for the fourth-best record in the Eastern Conference.MAGIC 119, CELTICS 114 Evan Fournier scored 24 points and Aaron Gordon had 19 points and 14 rebounds as Orlando broke an eight-game losing streak with a win over visiting Boston.The rookie Mario Hezonja scored 17 points, Tobias Harris had 16 and Nikola Vucevic had 16 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists for the Magic.Marcus Smart led Boston with 26 points, Isaiah Thomas added 23 points and Avery Bradley scored 22. The loss stopped a five-game winning streak for Boston, which had beaten Orlando by 113-94 two nights earlier.MAVERICKS 91, SUNS 78 Deron Williams scored 27 points and Dallas won at home without Dirk Nowitzki, surging past the lowly Phoenix.Dwight Powell had 6 straight points to give Dallas the lead for good in the fourth quarter.Nowitzki sat out the first of Dallass five games in seven nights. The Mavericks were hoping they could rest Nowitzki, their 37-year-old leading scorer, and still beat a team with 13 straight road losses."}
{"text": "Monday night does not signify the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. But it does signify the end of the beginning, as Iowans head to their caucus sites to nominate their choice of candidate for the Democratic and Republican Parties.There have been three years of preparations in some form or another by Hillary Clinton supporters  first by the group Ready for Hillary, then by her campaign. Now, the former secretary of state, whose last presidential candidacy crashed on the shoals of the caucuses in 2008, is hoping to notch a victory. But Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who has pushed Mrs. Clinton to the left in the primary, has been running a strong and well-funded challenge. Mrs. Clinton could still be seen as a flawed candidate, but her campaign is far better organized in Iowa this time than it was in 2008, and if she wins, it will have contributed significantly.On the Republican side, Donald J. Trump led the final Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll, over Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who late last year predicted at a private fund-raiser that Mr. Trumps campaign would show a gravitational arc. That has not happened in opinion polls, but no votes have yet been cast, of course.Still, given that many people predicted (including in this space) that Mr. Trump would be long gone from the race by the time of these Iowa caucuses, what he has accomplished, even absent a victory, has been impressive and has changed the nature of the 2016 campaign in both parties.As for the rest of the Republican field, it is hard to see either former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas or former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania continuing without a strong showing in a state each man won in previous elections. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, while polling extremely low, is waiting to see what happens in New Hampshire. The same is true for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who briefly led polls in Iowa, has held at about 10 percent recently. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio is basically bypassing the state.Then there is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, whose aides are hoping for a strong third-place showing that could help him finish respectably in New Hampshire.The ritual of the caucuses has changed this cycle, as the campaigns have become more nationalized  particularly with Mr. Trump in the Republican primary  and as more people question why the state has such prominence in the nominating process. Whether that status is preserved could depend on who wins the caucuses."}
{"text": "LONDON   Barely a week goes by without Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo scoring. They share more than 1,000 goals, and their careers are far from over.But if there is one aspect that we too seldom acknowledge, it is the sheer courage they possess to be such outstanding players. There are opponents who would cut them down without a second thought, and that happened on Saturday when Atltico Madrid defender Filipe Lus kicked Messi so high and so hard on his knee that it could have knocked the star out of the game for months. Permanently, even.The referee red carded Filipe Lus. Later, a second Atltico player, Diego Godn, was sent off for his second yellow-card foul.Barcelona wasnt allowed to be at its fluent best at home, but it still came from a goal down to win, 2-1, in front of 94,990 at the Camp Nou.The result put Barcelona three points clear of Atltico in La Liga, with the Catalan team having played a game less. And in recent years, these games, along with the Clsico involving Barcelona and Real Madrid, have decided who wins the Spanish title.Messi scored on Saturday; of course he did. And he played the full game despite that horrendous tackle before halftime.The coaches, both combative players in their day, reacted differently when questioned by reporters after the game. Barcelonas Luis Enrique was incensed, saying that he was shocked by a dangerous foul.Atlticos Diego Simeone saw nothing he could reproach Filipe Lus over. Not in any way he told reporters. It was an incident in the game and the referee interpreted it as he did.Simeone added: Im proud of the team that I have. We played a great first half, except for those 10 minutes when Bara pressed us and scored two goals. Even with nine men on the field, we still maintained our way of playing.You can win or lose, he concluded. I prefer losing like this every time.Atlticos website followed Simeones lead, calling the game an Honorable Defeat at Camp Nou.Honor is a matter of opinion. The referee, Undiano Mallenco, was swift and decisive in meting out those two red cards, along with three more yellow cards, to Atltico players. He issued none to Barcelona, even though Madrids Augusto Fernndez was the one player to be badly injured Saturday  he was taken off on a stretcher with, of all things, a knee injury.Yet how often in the past have we praised the organized and wholehearted way that Atltico, despite its comparatively meager payroll, has taken on the big two clubs in Spain, Barcelona and Real Madrid?The team reflects Simeones energetic approach to the game, with players putting everything they have into each performance. Until recently, Simeone has been constantly mentioned as a possible manager for Chelsea in the Premier League, though the word now is that Chelseas owner, Roman Abramovich, is looking for someone more inclined toward adventurous soccer than the uncompromising Simeone, whose teams fight and scrape for points.This might be less than fair. Simeone competes with what Atltico can afford, and the club frequently sells the best players he has developed to Europes biggest clubs.Chelsea has been a repeat customer of Atlticos, with its biggest purchase being the striker Diego Costa. It also acquired Filipe Lus in 2014, only to send him back after one season.Simeones forte is demanding and  more often than not  getting more out of players than other coaches are able to. He is right for Atltico because the club represents the more earthy side of Madrid, less swaggering and more blue-collar than Real.And under Simeone, Atltico has thrust itself between Barcelona and Real at the top of the standings. In doing so, it has at times skirted the border on what is physically acceptable during play and what is not.The way that Atltico rocked Barcelona in the first quarter of Saturdays game was, to use Simeones word, impressive. Atltico took the lead on an immaculate volley by Koke after a low cross from Sal.But then in a sign that things were heating up, two of Atlticos experienced enforcers, Godn and Gabi, were yellow carded within one minute of each other.The game was turning in Barcelonas favor: Andrs Iniesta was producing a sparkling quick step, Messi was roaming with intent and Luis Surez and Neymar were elusive up front.And the fullbacks, Dani Alves on the right and Jordi Alba on the left, were making penetrating runs down the flanks. A sharp exchange of passes let Messi score after 30 minutes, followed by Surez eight minutes later.Shortly after that, the Atltico player Juanfran was lucky to receive only a yellow card for his scything hack at Neymars calf. That was followed by Filipe Luis embedding his studs into Messis knee.Even though it was down to 10 men, Atltico started the second half as it did the first half  aggressively. Twice in a matter of minutes, Atlticos Antoine Griezmann bore down on the Barcelona goal, only for the keeper Claudio Bravo to thwart him both times, once while diving the wrong way.Playing one fewer player, Atltico dared to be the more aggressive team until a reckless sliding foul by Godn into the ankles of Surez left the Madrid club short two players.Indiscipline wrecked Atlticos chances for a win, while self-preservation was perhaps Barcelonas main motive on Saturday as its players kept the ball, and their limbs, out of harms way rather than pursue more goals."}

{"text": "American and European officials failed on Sunday to reach an agreement over how digital data  including financial information and social media posts  could be transferred between the two regions.Despite last-minute talks, the two sides remained far apart on specific details required to approve a comprehensive deal. Without an agreement, companies that regularly move data, including tech giants like Google and nontech companies like General Electric, could find themselves in murky legal waters.European and American officials had until Sunday evening to meet a deadline set by Europes national privacy agencies, some of which have promised aggressive legal action if the current negotiations founder. Those agencies will publish their own judgment on how data can be moved safely between the two regions on Wednesday.With time ticking down, the two sides are now hoping to agree to a broad deal before European national regulators act on Wednesday, according to several officials with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Still, negotiators said sticking points remained  including over how Europeans data would be protected from surveillance by the American government and how Europeans could seek legal remedies in American courts  and neither side could guarantee the final outcome.The rules governing the transfer of online data have become a vital issue for many businesses. Facebook and Google, for example, use the information to help tailor the advertisements that are central to their businesses. Many nontech companies, like G.E., move data related to their customers and employees, as well as on how their products are used.No big American company is expected to change how it does business immediately. But many have gathered teams of lawyers to protect themselves in case no deal emerges.Theres a lot of uncertainty, said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of the Linklaters law firm, who represents companies that may become tangled up in the standoff. We need a solution. Global business relies on transferring data. You cannot stop that.The most recent talks have been taking place in Brussels. Senior officials from the Commerce Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other American agencies traveled there last week. They have been meeting with the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that is in charge of the negotiations, along with senior national politicians from across Europe.With the talks increasingly stalled, Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, was expected to call Vera Jourova, the European commissioner of justice, on Sunday in the hopes of brokering a deal.The negotiations began three months ago after Europes highest court invalidated a 15-year-old data-transfer pact, a so-called safe harbor agreement. The judges ruled that Europeans data was not sufficiently protected when being transferred to the United States.European and American negotiators had been talking for years about a new deal, but the courts decision  which went into effect immediately  made action increasingly urgent.In recent weeks, American officials have offered a number of concessions to their European counterparts. They include increased oversight over American intelligence agencies access to European data, according to several officials involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.American officials have also proposed the creation of a so-called data ombudsman within the State Department. That office, according to officials, would give Europeans a direct point of contact in the United States if they believed government agencies had misused their data. Europeans also may seek arbitration directly with American companies that they accuse of unlawfully using their digital information.European officials, though, have expressed doubts that those moves would hold up if challenged in European courts. They have asked the Americans to provide specific details about how the current proposals would work in practice, according to two officials. In particular, Europeans want more information on the limits to American intelligence agencies access to European data, and on how Europeans can file legal claims in the United States.American officials have argued that their proposals will stand up to European legal challenges. They also believe the United States has levels of data protection comparable to those in the European Union, where privacy is valued as highly as freedom of expression.Weve agreed to make major changes, Bruce H. Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, said on Jan. 15. The U.S. takes individuals privacy very seriously.Any company  large or small  that transfers information between the two regions may face legal challenges. But the most likely targets for litigation, privacy advocates say, are large American tech giants like Google and Facebook that rely so heavily on peoples data.Several of Europes national data regulators, including Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, the French privacy chief who is chairwoman of a Pan-European data protection group, have said they will back a new data-transfer agreement if all of Europes privacy rights are upheld in the United States.But if a new pact is not approved  or does not meet national regulators standards  some European privacy watchdogs may demand new limits on the movement of data.Several consumer groups plan to file complaints about how companies transfer data as soon as Monday, arguing that peoples rights are not upheld when information is moved to the United States.These issues are going to end up back in court, said Peter Swire, a law professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who helped negotiate the original safe harbor agreement while working for the Clinton administration.The importance of the deal to the companies and privacy groups has crystallized in recent weeks, as American executives and government officials made it a top priority.At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for instance, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of the social network Facebook, held high-level discussions with a number of European and American politicians to voice the companys concerns about the pending deadline, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.Secretary Pritzker also met with Andrus Ansip, the European official in charge of the regions digital agenda, among other local policy makers, at Davos to discuss the new pact.On their way to negotiations in Brussels, a delegation of American officials made a stop in Paris last week, sitting down with a group of European national regulators to address concerns over how their citizens data was used in the United States.In Brussels, several trade groups regularly shuttled between meetings with senior European officials last week. The groups representing the tech industry came armed with a series of legal opinions from leading data protection experts that played down the differences in the way privacy was handled in the two regions.The legal arguments included details about why current United States rules were on par with those of Europe  a view that critics of Americas position jumped on almost immediately.That assessment just isnt true, said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has called for stronger data protection rules. Theres a massive difference over how this issue is treated in Europe compared to the U.S."}
{"text": "DAVENPORT  Good morning from Iowa, where there are many ways of trying to predict Monday nights caucus results  candidates crowd sizes, the enthusiasm, the highly regarded Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll, which overnight showed Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton with small leads.Heres another way: The eight individual vendors outside the Trump rally in Davenport on Saturday evening with table after table of trucker hats, bucket hats, buttons, T-shirts and other Trump-obelia.Ive worked Hillary, Bernie, Cruz and Rubio  Trump outsells them 10 to 1, said Don Kriener, a vendor from Florida. We quit doing everyone else a week ago. Sold all our stock to the people doing Hillary and Sanders.David Dixon, a fellow vendor, who was wearing six sample Trump buttons across his chest, agreed that on a pure scale of moving merchandise, Trump wins Iowa hands down.We love Huckabee, Mr. Dixon said, recalling the 2008 Republican winner and a third-tier candidate now, but it costs me a couple hundred bucks every time I do one of his rallies.The most popular merchandise? The ubiquitous Make America Great Again hat, and buttons with a Republican elephant wearing a Trump wig, one proclaiming Hot Chicks for Trump and another saying Bomb the [expletive] out of ISIS, echoing a Trump line.These vendors, who included two out-of-work truck drivers and an unemployed cook, could easily have taken the place of a television commentator, since they follow the races just as closely.If Trump takes Iowa, hell probably take New Hampshire and go all the way, Mr. Kriener, the unemployed cook, told me, presaging Mondays cable TV punditry. Hillary Clinton may win some delegates here but she will probably be indicted because of the 22 emails from yesterday. Joe Biden will step in at the last minute.As I do at every Trump rally, I surfed the line of waiting attendees, in search of an answer to the greatest unknown of this years caucuses: whether Mr. Trumps crowds will turn into a wave of caucus-goers. Of about 35 people, roughly two-thirds were still undecided. The rest were split between caucus tourists from out of state, who are ineligible to vote, and those planning to vote Trump. Almost all of the committed said this would be their first caucus, a very positive sign for the Trump campaign.Here are three sound bites:Scott Peters, school custodian, first-time caucus-goer, supporting Mr. Trump: Hes outside the system. I think Donald will do right.Chuck Scott, real estate investor, undecided: I liked Trump for a while but I compare it to going out with a really hot girl in high school. Its really fun but do you want to marry her?Jim Cox, from Illinois, ineligible: Im here for the biggest show in entertainment.For any out-of-staters wishing they were in Iowa for the excitement, consider living in the household of Gary Walke, a retired social studies teacher in Sumner I met last year. What a feeding frenzy, Gary wrote me in an email late Saturday. My wife tells she has answered 15 phone calls today.It wont be long now."}
{"text": "CAIRO   A popular Egyptian cartoonist was arrested Sunday on charges of running a website without a license, the Interior Ministry said, in the latest escalation of a campaign to silence the governments online critics.The cartoonist, Islam Gawish, 26, who has 1.6 million Facebook followers, was arrested during a police raid on the offices of a news website based in Cairo. Although his satirical cartoons have been published online, Mr. Gawish was not seen as an especially vehement critic of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.It was the most prominent arrest since the Jan. 25 anniversary of the 2011 uprising that ultimately toppled President Hosni Mubarak, which had been preceded by a wave of arrests and closures that focused on democracy activists and well-known cultural spaces in downtown Cairo.Although Mr. Sisis government has silenced many critical voices in Egypts major news media, either by arresting journalists or forcing them into exile, it has struggled to contain free speech on the Internet, which is one of the few forums for open dissent at a time when public protest has been all but outlawed.Facebook and other social media sites, which played a role in organizing the 2011 uprising, are popular with millions of Egyptians, but a few high-profile prosecutions have sent a warning to users about the limits of tolerance for political discussion.In October a military court handed down a three-year jail sentence to Amr Nohan, a 22-year-old law graduate who had posted to his Facebook page an image that depicted Mr. Sisi with Mickey Mouse-style cartoon ears.In recent weeks, the authorities arrested five people who are accused of administering hundreds of Facebook pages that were sympathetic to the banned Muslim Brotherhood and that had sought to encourage public protest on Jan. 25.The circumstances of Mr. Gawishs arrest, which follows the recent closing of the Townhouse Gallery arts space in central Cairo and a raid on the offices of a book publisher, seemed to signal that the government is seeking new ways to silence even moderate forms of dissent.In a recent cartoon, Mr. Gawish satirized Mortada Mansour, a progovernment lawmaker known for foul language and intemperate outbursts. Mr. Mansour, who heads Parliaments human rights committee, is shown in the caricature standing next to a torturer, advising him to lash his victim gently.The Sunday raid on the Egypt News Network, where Mr. Gawish worked, was carried out because the website was operating without an official permit, said Maj. Gen. Ayman Helmy, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.In an interview, Mohamed Elzyiat, a co-worker of Mr. Gawish, said the police raided the office without a search warrant and seemed to be mostly interested in Mr. Gawish. They were looking for Islam because of his cartoons that are critical of the regime, Mr. Elzyiat said.The Interior Ministry said Mr. Gawish was being charged with possessing pirated software and running an unauthorized personal website. It was not clear whether the website in question was his Facebook page.Mr. Gawishs lawyer, Mahmoud Othman, said his client was being held overnight at a police station, and was expected to face formal charges on Monday.The regime is worried about any creative work, Mr. Othman said. They have shut down art venues, and now they are arresting innovators. The state must be very fragile if it is afraid of cartoonists.Mr. Othman also said, The only creative work which is permitted is that which favors the state.The governments intolerance of free expression on the Internet has extended beyond antigovernment criticism.Four Coptic teenagers from Minya, 140 miles south of Cairo, are scheduled to stand trial later this week on charges of insulting religion because they had made a video, which was posted online, that mocked the Islamic State, the newspaper Mada Masr reported on Sunday."}
{"text": "Capitalism is under attack. Witness the popularity of Bernie Sanders, the socialist running neck and neck in the opinion polls with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday. To rehabilitate the system of free enterprise, it needs to be buttressed by a modern conception of fairness.Viewed from Mars, capitalism has been a huge success. Free enterprise has generated wealth and removed hundreds of millions of people from poverty. But viewed from Earth, what often stands out is how many have been left behind by the march of globalization and technology, while others have gotten ahead by methods more foul than fair.The classic left-wing response to the perceived unfairness of capitalism has been to tax and spend. That doesnt work well. High taxes can sap entrepreneurial spirit, while high welfare spending can leave poorer people dependent on handouts.Just because that response has been tried and failed doesnt mean it wont be tried again. The success of left-wing populists like the Syriza party in Greece and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party in Britain shows that such ideas still have appeal.This makes it important for centrists  whether they consider themselves left-wing progressives, radical centrists or liberal conservatives  to articulate a credible middle road. It should be based less on the view that fairness is the same as equality and more on the idea that people should get a fair crack at a good standard of life.There are two main aspects. First, it is important to tackle the foul methods by which people and companies get ahead and that make it tougher for hard-working, honest people to make progress.One example of this is evading or avoiding tax. This is rife in some countries, like Greece. But it is a global problem that makes people furious everywhere. Witness the anger in January in Britain over how Google, the Internet giant, was seemingly able to run rings around the authorities and pay what looks like a tiny amount of tax.Corruption, which is again widespread across the world, also creates indignation. Sweetheart deals between politicians and business line the pockets of the few to the detriment of the many.Another justified target of ire is the existence of markets that favor insiders at the expense of the general public. Finance is at the top of the list. The global financial crisis exposed how many bankers had a one-way bet: During the good times, they raked it in; during the bad, the state picked up the pieces. This was a mockery of how capitalism is supposed to work.Monopolies and vested interests are yet another source of resentment. Sometimes, the culprits are the oligarchs who pull the strings in government to get the rules written in their favor by giving bribes to politicians or senior officials.But often the beneficiaries of vested interests are not particularly rich or powerful as individuals. Greece is one of the best examples of this phenomenon. Over decades, it perfected the art of doling out special privileges to such an array of groups  farmers, notaries, pharmacists, civil servants, teachers and ordinary retirees as well as shipping magnates  that its economy gummed up.Such practices sap entrepreneurial spirit, but they do so by locking people out of opportunity rather than by using the methods of old-fashioned socialism. They also inflict bigger taxes on honest citizens and higher prices on consumers.A modern conception of fairness would put an assault of foul methods at its heart. But it would do more than that.Although successful societies need welfare states, most of Europes welfare states need refocusing. Part of the problem is that too much government spending is directed to what Europeans call the middle class rather than the needy.The situation varies from country to country, but the main goodies are generous state pensions for middle-to-high earners and tax breaks that benefit relatively well-off people. To be fair, some countries are reining these in. For example, Britain no longer offers such attractive incentives for rich people to save for their retirement. But in many countries, there is a lot that could be done.The money saved from funding this middle-class welfare state could be redeployed where it is needed. The priority would often be to invest in schools, so children get a fair start in life, and in adult education, so that older people whose skills become obsolete as a result of technology can retrain.Such a conception of fairness is not really new. It has a lot in common with classic liberalism. Nor is it dead. Successful politicians around the world  like Narendra Modi of India with his fight against corruption or Matteo Renzi of Italy with his willingness to confront some vested interests  are deploying some strategies from this playbook.It is a rich source of ideas with which to tackle the unfairness of capitalism without falling for the inefficiency of socialism."}
{"text": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa   Over the last few days, Donald J. Trump has proposed having Medicare negotiate lower prescription drug prices  a Democratic objective that Republicans hate  and, more characteristically of his party, has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would leave millions of people without health insurance.He has campaigned alongside Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, whose divisive crackdowns on undocumented immigrants made him a folk hero for nativists, while also promising to heal the countrys political ruptures.True to form, Mr. Trumps closing message to Iowa Republicans heading into Monday nights caucuses has been unruly, inconsistent and sometimes unpredictable.Like the salesman he is, he finds ways to flatter potential customers. In Dubuque, along the Mississippi, he told a crowd that he was thinking of buying a farm. In Council Bluffs, along the Missouri River, he joked on Sunday about the possibility that his daughter Ivanka, who is eight months pregnant, could go into labor before votes are cast.Politically, wouldnt it be great if she had her baby in Iowa? he said to applause.There is something in his message for almost everyone.For an evangelical Christian who may be discomfited by his multiple marriages, or by his background as a casino tycoon, Mr. Trump points to his support from Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University and son of the famous televangelist. In Davenport on Saturday, Mr. Falwell joined Mr. Trump at what was billed as a town-hall-style forum, though no audience questions were fielded. Yet Mr. Falwell offered Mr. Trump plenty of adulation, which Mr. Trump basked in, all perfectly timed for the late news in one of the states biggest media markets.And for a working-class voter to whom illegal immigration is an animating concern, Mr. Trump underscores his fierceness on the subject by trumpeting the support of Mr. Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., whose roundups of day laborers and use of racial profiling in traffic stops earned him international notoriety.Mr. Trumps candidacy is, to his voters, whatever they want to take from it. Sarah Palin, the Tea Party favorite and former vice-presidential nominee, attested to Mr. Trumps anti-establishment credentials for anyone who doubted that he, a New York billionaire, could be anything but a loyal member of the insider elite. And his wife, Melania, and three of his grown children provide constant character references for voters who might have thought twice about his harsh attacks on rivals.His most consistent, and tightest, message remains against his closest rival in the polls ahead of the caucuses, Senator Ted Cruz, whom he has excoriated over his Canadian birthplace and his failure to disclose as much as $1 million in bank loans used in his 2012 campaign for the Senate.But for the most part, Mr. Trump has smoothed the edges of his more caustic ideas in the homestretch here.He still vows to build a wall on the Mexican border, but he sounds a softer note about people who are deported, saying they are welcome to return legally. He has largely dropped from his speeches any talk of a ban on Muslims entering the country. Instead, he has kept his aim focused largely on Hillary Clinton, portraying himself as able to win states that no other Republican would be able to in a general election.As Mr. Cruz has bet on a traditional organizational model and an appeal to a network of pastors who have helped previous caucus winners, Mr. Trump has followed a game plan that is decidedly unconventional.He rewards his voters with flattery. By far, the Trump person, the Trump voter is most loyal, he told voters at a rally at a school gym in Council Bluffs on Sunday, referring to the latest poll results as proof.But he also taunts caucusgoers, saying Iowans have a track record of picking losers. Iowa has not won in 16 years, he said in Clinton, referring to the most recent Republican caucus winners. Wouldnt that be terrible if I lost in Iowa, won everywhere else?Id be very angry, he added teasingly. But only for a day. I still love you.If Mr. Trump was nervous about the looming caucuses, he did not show it over the weekend. Theres a theory we could do even better than the polls, he said.But he did seem to allow for the possibility that he could stand to benefit from the kind of intervention that cannot be bought.After bunking down Saturday across from the Horseshoe Casino in Council Bluffs, Mr. Trump attended Sunday morning services at First Christian Orchard Campus, a nondenominational church where more than 500 people worshiped inside a cavernous hall. The pastor, in jeans and a sweater, delivered a lively sermon; Mr. Trump bounced along to the music of a live band. He took communion, put money in the collection plate and posed for a picture with a curly-haired blond boy who approached him.As he left the church, another pastor asked to lay hands on Mr. Trump and pray for him. The pastor held Mr. Trumps hand and put a hand on his shoulder.Thank you, Mr. Trump said when the clergyman had finished. I need that."}
{"text": "When Josephine Diaz heard the sirens blaring by her home on Crotona Avenue in the Tremont section of the Bronx early Tuesday morning, she wrapped herself in a blanket and headed outside. Thick plumes of smoke filled her lungs as Ms. Diazs fears were confirmed: The abandoned house on her block was burning.Soon after firefighters doused the flames, they discovered a body. Days later the dead man was identified as David Gonzalez, 64, who neighbors said had been living for years in the dilapidated, wood-frame house.Tremont residents had known Mr. Gonzalez as a neighborhood fixture, a kind man with a limp who often took in other homeless people. They gave him castoff clothes and household objects that he would often sell from his unkempt yard.Just two days after Mr. Gonzalez died, another abandoned building in the Bronx caught fire, at 221 West Kingsbridge Road. There, too, the authorities found the body of an apparent squatter.Nationally, about 7 percent of all fires take place in abandoned residential buildings, according to a report issued in March by the National Fire Data Center, a part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Based on information for 2010-2012, the report found that on average, those fires caused 60 deaths, 225 injures and about $777 million in property loss each year.In New York City, there were 38 fires deliberately set and 25 accidental fires in vacant buildings in 2014, a March 2015 report by the New York Fire Departments Bureau of Fire Investigation showed. The numbers tend to increase during the winter months, department officials said, when the cold temperatures drive homeless people to seek refuge indoors. The fires often happened, they said, when people tried to patch together electric and heating systems.Squatters and vacant houses have always been an issue, said Michael Parrella, a spokesman for the Fire Department. They present many different dangers to the public and of course to anyone desperate enough to put themselves in that situation. Accidents are relatively common.An investigation revealed that the Crotona Avenue fire was caused by extension cords that snaked throughout the building, stealing power from nearby sources, according to Jim Long, another Fire Department spokesman. He said cold weather tended to exacerbate such perilous situations.If theres no power, what do they do to establish it? Mr. Long said. When you use multiple extension cords and they power multiple appliances, it can be very dangerous.The cause of the West Kingsbridge Road fire was careless use of an open flame, Fire Department officials said on Sunday. The victim has not been identified.Although about 58,000 people  representing a majority of the citys homeless population  are housed in the network of facilities overseen by the Department of Homeless Services, an estimated 3,000 live on the streets and in abandoned buildings like the ones that burned last week.Many of the unsheltered homeless people prefer squatting to the dangers posed on the street or inside the shelter system, advocates for the homeless said. Cases like the murder last week of a shelter resident in East Harlem at the hands of his roommate seemed to fuel that anxiety.When youre living on the street or in shelters, your dignity is just robbed and you face constant danger, said Marcus Moore, 44, a former security guard who has struggled with homelessness for several years. He said he had experienced several episodes of violence and theft in shelters and on the street.Mr. Moore, a member of Picture the Homeless, a group that advocates on behalf of homeless people, has taken refuge at times in unoccupied properties across the city  an act he considers to be homesteading and the safest alternative available to him.I have a better chance of going inside a vacant house and blocking the door with a table and staying safe from someone who might want to hurt me or steal from me somewhere else, he said.The haphazard dwellings are no secret to city officials, or to the neighbors.The guy lived there for years, Diomedes Quezada, 60, a car salesman and the husband of Ms. Diaz, said of Mr. Gonzalez. He was a nice guy, never gave people trouble, always saying hello to anyone who walked by. Everyone knew him.The Department of Buildings had also been aware that the Crotona Avenue building was abandoned and that squatters had moved in, according to department documents. Complaints from 2012 and 2013 indicated that squatters lived on the property. In January 2015, another complaint called the building unstable and a fire hazard, noting that a plastic bag had taken the place of disintegrating roof shingles and that the side wall was in danger of collapsing because of damage from a fire.A complaint also cited structural damage to the building on West Kingsbridge Road, which residents had known to be a home to squatters.Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said several city agencies worked together to secure abandoned homes and to find suitable housing for anyone living in them, though that process could be difficult.Were cognizant both of the safety and quality-of-life issues of the tenants of these places, Mr. Norvell said. Through any number of existing initiatives, we hope to reach people to serve them in such a way as to get them into decent, safe housing.The morning after the fire on Crotona Avenue, neighbors shuddered as they passed the small white house, its top floor charred. The yard was littered with debris, scraps of a life now gone: shopping carts, mattresses, a Disney princess bag, Christmas lights, clothes, posters, loaves of bread, a fire extinguisher.While the authorities said the fire could have posed a threat to nearby buildings, Mr. Gonzalezs neighbors in Tremont nonetheless expressed sympathy for him.The squatter houses arent a bother at all, Yvette Jackson, a retiree who lives near the Crotona Avenue fire site, said. Who could blame them for trying when the shelters are so terrible?Mr. Long, the Fire Department spokesman, said although the actions of squatters could threaten firefighters, Whether theyre in there lawfully or not, were concerned about saving those lives."}

With its shelves of books, paperwork-covered desk and tchotchkes like an alien doll and a synthetic human mask, the office is a pleasingly cluttered free-fire zone, the author said.As a writer, did you fantasize about having a home office?I didnt fantasize about any of it. The idea that I could own a house in New York was not on my list of fantasies. We had a baby and then another one imminent. We lived in the East Village, and not only did we not have enough room in our apartment, but it was the height of the crack epidemic. In order to try to avoid moving out of the city, we came to Brooklyn.You know, in 1989, you sort of didnt go to Brooklyn. In fact, it was an admission of defeat if you moved here.What do you love about your office?The fact that its my place. And literally that its this dark color, which makes it feel like a giant velvet chair. In New York, you make your peace with not having space. Once I did have a separate office, it was amazing.Some people cant work from home. The TV or the refrigerator beckons, or their children barge in.Because Id had real jobs that I had to show up for every day, I baked in that discipline. You get up, you have breakfast, you start to work.But for a 4-year-old, thats hard to understand. Daddys here all day. What do you mean I cant come in? Thats tough and sad at first, and then they get used to it. And then they grow up thinking you dont work, you just stay home all day.I have to ask: Whats with the baby doll on the fireplace mantel?Apparently, as a very small boy I carried it around and loved it. It was called Boy Doll. I had matching onesies, cutely. But I dont remember loving it.Tell me about that human mask on the bureau.We did a piece on the radio show about this artist who takes DNA from whatever, and then based on what she can discern from the DNA creates those faces. Without telling her who it was, my producers gave her some of my DNA.Do you see any semblance to yourself?Im white! But I like it. Its creepy."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Neither Bernie Sanders nor Donald J. Trump will repeat Barack Obamas 2008 victory in the Iowa caucuses.That is the prediction from Tom Vilsack, a former Democratic governor of Iowa and onetime presidential hopeful, as voters in his home state gather Monday to register their first-in-the-nation choices for the presidential nominees.Mr. Vilsack, who knows his states political landscape about as well as anyone, now serves as the secretary of agriculture, the last remaining member of President Obamas original cabinet.Just days before returning to Iowa for the final weekend of the campaign there, Mr. Vilsack sat down to talk about his states voters, the candidates on both sides and his seven years in Mr. Obamas administration.A longtime supporter of Hillary Clinton who is aggressively backing her bid for the presidency, Mr. Vilsack said neither Mr. Sanders nor Mr. Trump  both of whom have held large, boisterous rallies in recent weeks  had managed to electrify voters quite the way Mr. Obama did eight years ago, when he nearly doubled the usual Democratic turnout in Iowa.The feel out there, its not the same, Mr. Vilsack said. Its a version of that, but its by no means the level of intensity.He continued, You could go into Henry County, you could go into Mills County, and you might find a Bernie Sanders supporter or two, but you arent going to find that same cadre of people who were crazy about Barack Obama.Mr. Vilsack said polls that showed Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump in front were misleading because they did not reflect the geographic distribution of their support. Most of the passion for both men is concentrated around Iowas cities, Mr. Vilsack said. That will help them win caucus gatherings near the cities, but it wont help them across the rest of rural Iowa, he said.Trump has the same challenge that Sanders has, I think, Mr. Vilsack said. If you have a big turnout in Des Moines, thats great. But if you lose Plymouth, OBrien, Cass, Montgomery, Mills Counties, it can overshadow the fact that you had 350 people at Ward 1 in Des Moines. Youve got to be smart about this.Mr. Vilsack once thought his smarts about Iowa could catapult him to the presidency. But his 2008 bid for the White House quickly fizzled, and he endorsed Mrs. Clinton.His efforts to deliver his state for her failed when Mrs. Clinton ran into Mr. Obamas Iowa juggernaut.Now, Mr. Vilsack is heading into his final year at the Agriculture Department, where he helped negotiate the 2014 farm bill, a nearly $1 trillion measure that had sparked four years of partisan fighting over farm subsidies and support for the food stamp program for the poor.Mr. Vilsack was also central in pushing for passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010.The law mandated the use of whole grains, vegetables and fruits at schools and required that students select at least one portion of fruits or vegetables at every lunch.He has also pushed for the use of biofuels. This past month, Mr. Vilsack joined Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy, as the guided-missile destroyer William P. Lawrence was filled with biofuel made from beef fat. He called it an extraordinary experience and said it is an example of the series of partnerships that has extended the reach of the U.S.D.A.Mr. Vilsack is a low-key, soft-spoken man, and his job overseeing the nations farmers has largely kept him out of the spotlight. The exception came early in his second year in the job, in what he acknowledges was the low point in his career.Reacting to a video that showed seemingly racist comments from Shirley Sherrod, an Agriculture Department official in Georgia, Mr. Vilsack quickly fired her. He was forced to publicly apologize to Ms. Sherrod days later when it became clear that the video had been heavily edited by the operators of a conservative website. In fact, the full video showed Ms. Sherrod offering a lesson in racial tolerance and compassion.Mr. Vilsacks apology was direct and rare for Washington: This is a good woman, he said in February of 2010. Shes been put through hell. I could have done and should have done a better job.Six years later, Mr. Vilsack said the incident had prompted him to lead a transformation at the department after Ms. Sherrod complained that little federal agriculture assistance was being directed to communities where extreme poverty was persistent.We changed that, Mr. Vilsack said. After the incident, he noted, he worked with Ms. Sherrod to establish a strike force that now operates in 910 counties to direct more than $23 billion in home loans, farm loans and other assistance in areas trying to overcome poverty.The incident with Ms. Sherrod generated a renewed effort at diversity in the department, which now includes one of the most diverse groups of senior executives in the federal government, he said.And it motivated him to stay in the job throughout the presidents administration, a rarity in modern-day Washington.Its been a new day, he said.The reputation of U.S.D.A. when I came into this job was that we were the last plantation. I dont think people feel that way today.Mr. Vilsack was unanimously confirmed as secretary on Jan. 20, 2009. He is by one measure the most loyal member of Mr. Obamas original cabinet  the only one who still remains in his original job.(Shaun Donovan joined the cabinet as the secretary of housing and urban development, and now serves as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.)But he is still, at heart, a die-hard Clinton supporter. Over the weekend, Mr. Vilsack campaigned for Mrs. Clinton with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a Get Out the Caucus event in Iowa Falls.He dismisses concerns from some Democrats that Mrs. Clinton has failed to demonstrate the kind of passion that Mr. Sanders has often displayed at big rallies in Iowa and across the country.I think there is a different kind of passion that fuels the Clinton campaign, Mr. Vilsack said. Its not the rah-rah, big rally, yelling, screaming type of passion. It is the passion of perseverance.He said Iowa women, in particular, recognize that sense of perseverance in working for a better future for their families, and he predicted that their support would help Mrs. Clinton emerge from the caucuses victorious.They are not going to be doing high-fives and all that kind of stuff, he said, but they are going to be there on caucus night."}
{"text": "BLACKSBURG, Va.   The arrest of two Virginia Tech students in the abduction and murder of a 13-year-old girl who posted on a Facebook group called Teen Dating and Flirting  and showed a neighbor girl texts she said she had exchanged with an 18-year-old man  has set off new concerns about the dangers to young people who seek liaisons on social media.The two students  David Eisenhauer, 18, of Columbia, Md., and Natalie M. Keepers, 19, of Laurel, Md., both aspiring engineers  are being held without bond; they made brief court appearances Monday but did not enter pleas. They are charged in the death of Nicole Madison Lovell, 13, a liver transplant recipient who disappeared from her home here last week.The murder has stunned this college community, though Virginia Tech, the site of a 2007 massacre that remains the deadliest shooting by a single gunman in the nations history, is no stranger to sorrow and tragedy. And while the authorities have not said what, if any, role social media may have played in the killing, the girls electronic communications, and suggestions that she was bullied, have stirred deep concern here.Stacey Snider, a neighbor of Nicole and mother of 8-year-old twins, said one of her daughters had given law enforcement authorities information that may have played a role in the arrests. The girls were playing in the snow with Nicole hours before her disappearance when, they said, she showed one of them texts she had exchanged through Kik, a mobile instant messaging app, with an 18-year-old that included plans for an evening meeting.She said that he was 18, but I didnt think it was real, one of the twins, Jaydon Snider, who said she had seen the text, said in an interview Monday, in a cul-de-sac near where Nicole lived. I was like, You shouldnt do that.Law enforcement officials have raised concerns about the Kik app as a potential vehicle for sexual predators; a teacher at the Bronx High School of Science,whom the police said had used a messaging app, was arrested last year on charges of child pornography.It was not clear whether the 18-year-old was Mr. Eisenhauer. But in Maryland, the arrests of two seemingly promising students have shocked their communities.Mr. Eisenhauer, a 2015 graduate of Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, was a high school track star who was once featured on a Baltimore television station for his track achievements. I just have this internal thing saying I want to be the best, he said then. The schools principal, James LeMon, called Mr. Eisenhauer, who had moved to Maryland from Washington State, an excellent student athlete.Mr. Eisenhauer faces a charge of first-degree murder. A statement from the Blacksburg police said he and Nicole were acquainted prior to her disappearance but did not say how. It said that Mr. Eisenhauer, who was arrested on Saturday hours after Nicoles remains were found in North Carolina, used this relationship to abduct the 13-year-old and kill her, and that Ms. Keepers had helped him dispose of the body.Ms. Keepers, a 2015 graduate of Hammond High School in Columbia, worked on that schools literary magazine and was assistant director of its theater department. She was arrested Sunday.Friends and neighbors described Nicole as a sweet girl; her two Facebook pages are filled with the usual stuff of a 13-year-olds life  posts about pandas, boyfriends and music. But they also say she seemed to be connecting with older boys through social media in a way they found troubling. One neighbor, Sara Demiri, 15, also said older boys on the bus had sometimes bullied Nicole.Nicoles brief comments in the Facebook group Teen Dating and Flirting, a site replete with sexually charged messages  including some that appear to be from adults looking to prey on young people  have also created unease.My first thought is that this kid was really too young to have been using Facebook, said Jenn Burleson Mackay, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who teaches social media use in the Department of Communication. To be looking for boyfriends and dating advice on Facebook at age 13 just seems inappropriate.Facebook declined to comment, except to say it was looking at the group page. The company prohibits users under age 13, and publishes a set of community standards for use of the site that ban, among other things, nude images, threats, bullying, harassment and anything that promotes sexual exploitation.Nicoles mother, Tammy Weeks, declined to be interviewed on Monday; a police officer stood by the eight-unit, two-story apartment block where she lives here, and shooed a reporter away. But The Washington Post, in an article published in Mondays newspaper, quoted Ms. Weeks as saying her daughter, a seventh grader at Blacksburg Middle School, was bullied on social media and at school, particularly about her appearance.She didnt like going to school, because she was bullied, the newspaper quoted Ms. Weeks as saying. She added that her daughter had told her that girls were saying she was fat and talking about her scars from her transplant, which included a tracheotomy scar.At Blacksburg Middle School on Monday, school officials called in counselors for the students, and asked reporters to keep their distance while their community grieved.Nicoles disappearance, sometime between midnight and 7 a.m. Wednesday, prompted an intense search and led her father, David Lovell, to issue an anguished plea on television for her to come home. In an interview with WDBJ, a station in Roanoke, Mr. Lovell said he was worried about his daughters health; she needed daily medications.At this point, I know that shes sick, shes hurting, shes probably already into convulsions, her liver is shutting down as we speak, Mr. Lovell told the station. Right now, Im scared to death.On Monday, for the second day in a row, Virginia State Police divers searched a pond on the Virginia Tech campus. The State Police confirmed that the divers were searching for evidence in the death of Nicole, at the request of the Blacksburg police, but declined to be more specific or say what was found.Friends of Mr. Eisenhauers said on Monday that his social life, at least in high school, centered on seven or eight long-distance runners who hung out together. He took Advanced Placement classes and was not a partyer, said Paul Lyon, a high school classmate and fellow runner. Wed go to someones house and get out the Xbox and play Halo or something.He was also on the track and field team at Virginia Tech, though the schools sports department has taken down its page about him.On the Virginia Tech campus, where memories of the 2007 shooting by a student that left 32 people dead remain strong, there was deep dismay yet again.Weve obviously had a lot of tragedy here before, said Devynn Breen, a junior from northern Maryland who majors in animal and poultry science. But its just hard to think that one of your fellow Hokies is capable of this."}
{"text": "More than 400,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers living in what is now Israel perked up a diet of game and vegetables with something unusual: tortoises.The evidence shows they regularly ate turtle, said Ran Barkai, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University and one of the researchers who made the discovery. It was a sort of supplementary dish, maybe like a dessert or an opener to dinner.The findings appear in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews.Inside the Qesem Cave near Tel Aviv, Dr. Barkai and his colleagues discovered the remains of tortoise shells with burns, as well as tortoise bones with markings left by stone tools.The remains suggest that the inhabitants sometimes roasted tortoises whole over a fire and sometimes butchered them first, Dr. Barkai said, adding, Somehow they cut them with stone knives, and most probably into small pieces.Qesem Cave was discovered accidentally during a road construction project in 2000 and has proved to be a trove of ancient tools and fossils.The inhabitants were hunter-gatherers who came and went from the cave. They hunted mainly game animals like fallow deer, wild horses and cattle. Evidence suggests they also ate vegetable material.What we know now is that they also had turtle on the menu, Dr. Barkai said.He and his colleagues are now studying the remains of bird bones discovered in the cave."}
{"text": "No matter who prevails as the Republican presidential candidate and who wins the election next November, there may already be a big and enduring win out of this crazy race  for the environment, including ailing monarch butterflies. If butterflies had hands instead of wings, theyd be clapping for Senator Ted Cruz.Cruz creditably withstood the perennial temptation  among Republicans and Democrats alike  to bow down to Big Corn and the federal mandate for ethanol that has been such a boon to Iowa corn farmers and bane if you care about food prices, greenhouse gas emissions, herbicide use or the loss of wild vegetation in the Midwest that is an important food source for monarchs and habitat for other wildlife.I wont be voting for Cruz if he ends up the candidate, but I credited his stance on the Oregon wildlife refuge takeover and applaud his determination to stick to conservative principles on the harm from politically motivated subsidies.There were, of course, many other issues in play in Iowa, including the interests of evangelical Christians. But it does at least seem plausible that the ethanol litmus test is broken for good. (Listen to the interaction between Cruz and an angry farmer to see how he overcame doubts, at least in that instance.)As Coral Davenport reported in a piece that ran on Sunday, the power of the ethanol mandate is waning for a variety of reasons  some national, but others within Iowas boundaries:Energy policy experts, advocates in the fight on poverty and even other farmers say a law that has been a boon for Iowa has been a boondoggle to the rest of the country. The ethanol mandate has driven up food costs while failing to deliver its promised environmental benefits. Rising domestic oil production and a global energy glut have all but nullified the pitch that ethanol would help wean the country off foreign oil.Even here, as Iowa urbanizes and diversifies, ethanol may be losing its once-powerful hold, some political consultants say. And now a powerful coalition including oil companies, environmentalists, grocery manufacturers, livestock farmers and humanitarian advocates is pushing Congress to weaken or repeal the mandate. As soon as this week, the Senate could vote on a measure to roll back the Renewable Fuel Standard, just days after the Iowa caucuses close and the issue largely goes to rest for another four years.Does this mean all incentives on energy are bad? No.In a wise Op-Ed article on Sunday,Margo Oge, a former senior Environmental Protection Agency official and the author ofDriving the Future: Combating Climate Change With Cleaner, Smarter Cars, laid out an approach to fostering progress toward developingtruly renewable biologically-based energy sources.Heres an excerpt:Ethanol thrives because of the volume-based approach of the mandate, which specifies that a growing percentage of various renewable fuels must be mixed into gasoline every year until 2022.But that approach has stifled innovation and, if its track record to date is any indication, biofuels will not be a major player in meeting our 2050 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks.What we should be talking about is a performance-based approach to developing gasoline substitutes that will reduce emissions.

{"text": "AGUADILLA, P.R.   To understand how Puerto Ricos power authority has piled up $9 billion in debt, one need only visit this bustling city on the northwest coast.Twenty years ago, it was just another town with dwindling finances. Then, it went on a development spree, thanks to a generous some might say ill-considered  gift from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.Today, Aguadilla has 19 city-owned restaurants and a city-owned hotel, a water park billed as biggest in the Caribbean, a minor-league baseball stadium bathed in floodlights and a waterfront studded with dancing fountains and glimmering streetlights.Most striking is the ice-skating rink. Unusual in a region where the temperature rarely drops below 70 degrees, the rink is complete with a disco ball and laser lights.Signs warn skaters not to wear shorts.Imagine how much it costs to have an ice-skating rink in the tropics, said Sergio Marxuach, policy director at the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research group in San Juan.And that is the catch. What most likely would be the biggest recurring expense for these attractions  electricity  costs Aguadilla nothing. It has been provided free for years by the power authority, known as Prepa.In fact, the power authority has been giving free power to all 78 of Puerto Ricos municipalities, to many of its government-owned enterprises, even to some for-profit businesses  although not to its citizens. It has done so for decades, even as it has sunk deeper and deeper in debt, borrowing billions just to stay afloat.Now, however, the islands government is running out of cash, facing a total debt of $72 billion and already defaulting on some bonds  and an effort is underway to limit the free electricity, which is estimated to cost the power authority hundreds of millions of dollars.But like many financial arrangements on the island, the free electricity is so tightly woven into the fabric of society that unwinding it would have vast ramifications and, some say, only worsen the plight of the people who live here.If the towns dont get free energy, theyre going to have to pay for it by increasing their property taxes or something, so the people will end up paying, said Eduardo Bhatia, the president of the Puerto Rico Senate. Residents of the island are already upset about a recent sales tax increase to 11 percent, from 7 percent, and a property tax increase now would cause an outcry. The last assessment was in 1958.The free electrical power is just one example of the power authoritys complex and paradoxical role in the economy here. On Tuesday, Mr. Bhatia will begin hearings to determine who and what are to blame for the authoritys larger problems, especially its ancient and inefficient power plants, among the last in North America to burn oil. Culprits are expected to include the authoritys secretive purchasing managers, elected officials who wasted money on natural gas pipelines that were scrapped and an institutional hostility to wind and solar power that is hard to fathom on a breezy island where the sun shines most days.This is the great mystery that we have to unravel in the coming months, Mr. Bhatia said in an interview.Meanwhile, though, the free electricity offers a window into the workings of the islands sole power provider and demonstrates how complex the solutions to the larger debt troubles are likely to be.Its symbolic of a lot of things here in Puerto Rico, said Miguel Soto-Class, the president of the Center for a New Economy, which has been urging changes at Prepa for the last 10 years. Every time we start to get into this, they always come back and say: Well, theres nothing we can do. Weve got to keep the lights on. Carlos Mndez Martnez, the mayor of Aguadilla, said the city-owned attractions had turned Aguadillas onetime deficit into a surplus and generated profits he uses to pay down debt, improve low-income housing and offer free wheelchairs and delivered meals to shut-ins. The profits have also allowed him to keep a 17-year-old promise not to raise taxes. Last year, he even paid a dividend to every man, woman and child in the city  a free ticket to the water park, which otherwise costs residents $20.These achievements have inspired voters to elect Mr. Mndez four times. Aguadilla has no term limits, and he expects to win again this year.I can be mayor until the day I die, he said in a recent interview.Mr. Mndez said it was fair to use the power authoritys free electricity for municipal development, because Prepa paid no property taxes or licensing fees for its many facilities in Aguadilla. But anticipating limits on his free power now that the authority is struggling for solvency, he recently put a solar power system on the roof of the skating rink that he hopes will eventually get it off the grid.Aguadilla may be the most visible example, but other municipalities use Prepas free electricity to power air-conditioned restaurants and hotels, lighting systems for minor-league baseball games at night, lighting and sound systems for festivals, and other enterprises. Until now, the power authoritys terms gave cities no incentive to conserve. The more free power they used, the more they could receive.We have heard of many private entities that for years have run a private business in a building owned by a municipality, and they never paid for power, said Agustin F. Carb Lugo, president of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission. The commission, established in 2014, is the power authoritys first independent regulator; previously the public-owned monopoly regulated itself.The free power dates from 1941, when the utility was established by Rexford Tugwell, a member of Franklin D. Roosevelts brain trust and the last American governor of Puerto Rico to be appointed by the president of the United States. He contended that for electricity to benefit the people, it had to be owned by the people, and he created Prepa by nationalizing the handful of private electric companies then on the island.The private companies had paid local property taxes, but publicly owned Prepa did not. Free electricity was intended to make up for the lost tax revenue. The value of the free power was supposed to match the forgone taxes, and if cities took more, they were supposed to pay for it. But the rates are driven by oil prices, which since the 1970s have lost any connection they might have had to property values, and the power authority simply stopped trying to collect what cities owed. In 2014 a consulting firm found the cities had received $420 million worth of free electricity that they should have paid for.Nor was it just towns and cities. The consulting firm FTI Capital Advisors found that 288 governmental bodies on the island were delinquent in their power payments by $300 million. Among them were public schools, hospitals, low-income housing projects, a commuter train, the islands water and sewerage system, and its highway authority, which operates traffic signals, toll plazas and highway lighting.If the power authority were to demand immediate payment from them, it could set off a domino effect of defaults and insolvencies.In 2012, for example, Puerto Ricos port authority fell $60 million behind on its electric bills, and the utility threatened to cut off power to the islands main commercial airport, in San Juan. That would have forced the airport to close, a catastrophe for an island economy that caters to tourists.To avert a crisis, the government sold the airport to a private investment group from Mexico, and used the proceeds to make a dent in the overdue $60 million. But before long, what was left of the port authority, nine seaports and 11 small airports, started falling behind on electric bills again.The power authority is working out a payment plan for them.Other delinquencies have been tougher to resolve. When the power authority threatened to turn off the power in the commuter rail systems administrative offices, rail officials scoffed, saying the authority had no legal standing to enforce its claims.Nobodys happy, Senator Bhatia said in a recent interview in San Juan. Nobodys in a good position, and thats why we have to keep working together."}

In fact I take pride in my role in their training. They are wonderful, and their program is stunning. I want to bring to your attention a theme that was not included in the article but is central to the program: the team. There are myriad health care professionals who are as engaged as the physicians in the operation of the program. It is through the team that the program succeeds; i.e., their unique training, their commitment, their communication and their mutual respect. They include doctors of nurse practice, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, medical assistants, licensed vocational nurses, social workers, administrative personnel, and many others. My most sincere congratulations to the team, those interprofessional individuals who together make this service function very well.Donald E. Girard, M.D. Portland, Ore.TO THE EDITOR:We are not winning the battle with aging by waiting for more medical students to become geriatric medical specialists. To immediately encourage medical students to work in geriatrics, their approximate $200,000 debt should qualify for student loan forgiveness programs, such as those for schoolteachers who serve low-income communities and other public services.A long-term approach is to create a large corps of physicians whose responsibility is to render enlightened and cost-effective care to older Americans. To do so, we would have to follow the example of the military draft by providing very adequate payment for the few years of service as well as an initial intensive brief education/training period administered by the local medical/hospital leadership institutes. As with the G.I. Bill after World War II, we should also provide tuition costs for all to experience any desired further training.Leslie S.

{"text": "S-HERTOGENBOSCH, the Netherlands  A small 16th-century oil on panel largely kept in storage at a Kansas City, Mo., museum is a work by the Dutch Renaissance master Hieronymus Bosch, researchers here said on Monday, a finding that, if accepted by other scholars, would add to the tiny list of about 25 recognized Bosch paintings in the world.The painting, The Temptation of St. Anthony, dated 1500-1510, had previously been attributed to the workshop of Bosch or to a follower of Bosch, known for his comic and surreal images of heaven and hell and the earthly moral purgatory in between.The new attribution is based on studies of underdrawings, a comparison of motifs and details on a microscopic level with similar ones in undisputed Bosch paintings, and an analysis of Boschs brush work. Taken together, the evidence indicates that St. Anthony is in Boschs handwriting, said experts from the Bosch Research and Conservation Project, a six-year, $3.3 million effort to study and catalog all of the artists works before the 500th anniversary of his death in 1516.Its the same painting, and all of a sudden you see it with more affection, Julin Zugazagoitia, the director and chief executive officer of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, said on Friday in Amsterdam. Its like your child who just won the Nobel Prize.With the attribution, St. Anthony would be one of only five Bosch works in the United States. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven each own one painting by Bosch, and the Morgan Library & Museum in New York has a Bosch drawing.The Nelson-Atkins, a small but highly regarded museum with a $30 million annual operating budget and about a half a million visitors a year, has a collection of 40,000 to 50,000 works, with highlights by Caravaggio, Gauguin and Monet.Independent experts have not yet reviewed the projects evidence, and it can take years for scholars to come to a consensus on the authenticity of a painting. This attribution is based, however, on the most comprehensive study of Bosch works ever conducted, and it is accompanied by the publication of a 1,000-page monograph on Bosch by a team of eight specialists, including Bosch scholars and scientists.Its an intriguing and plausible attribution, Joseph Koerner, a professor of art history and architecture at Harvard, and the author of a coming book on Bosch and Bruegel, said on Sunday. He said he would need to see the painting himself before making a final determination.Professor Koerner said that the work of the Bosch project was highly respected among scholars. At the same time, he added, theres no question that these attributions  and Im sure they will admit this themselves  are not a science ultimately. Its partly an art.The Temptation of St. Anthony will be on display at the Noordbrabants Museum here in s-Hertogenbosch, the artists hometown, as part of Hieronymus Bosch: Visions of Genius, the largest Bosch retrospective ever assembled. The show, which opens on Feb. 13, will feature 20 Bosch paintings and 19 drawings.Matthijs Ilsink, the coordinator of the Bosch Research and Conservation Project and a co-curator of the retrospective, said he first became interested in the painting when he saw it in an exhibition catalog several years ago and got a tip from an amateur historian who had taken an interest in the work.But Kansas City is a long flight from Amsterdam, and so he put the picture on his lengthy to-check list. It was not until last fall, after he and his colleagues were finishing up their studies for the monograph, that he remembered the work at the Nelson-Atkins.Assembling the retrospective required an intensive nine-year effort to get larger institutions to entrust their Bosches to a small museum with limited resources. Among the works on display are Haywain Triptych, on loan from the Prado in Madrid, and The Adoration of the Magi from the Met, as well as nine paintings that have been recently restored, six of them with the help of the research project.Notably absent is Garden of Earthly Delights, which is a centerpiece of the Prado and has not left Spain in more than 400 years.The research project, which was financed by the city of s-Hertogenbosch, the Foundation Jheronimus Bosch 500, the Gieskes-Strijbis Fund and the Getty Foundation, examined about 35 paintings by Bosch, his followers or members of his workshop.The Temptation of St. Anthony, which is about 15 inches tall and 10 inches wide, was probably part of a much larger panel from a triptych that was dismantled at some point in the last 500 years. It had been heavily retouched and painted over.The Nelson-Atkins bought the work from a dealer in New York in 1935, two years after the museum was founded on the former estate of William Rockhill Nelson, a real estate developer and founder of The Kansas City Star newspaper.St. Anthony contains the bizarre details that have long amused and baffled viewers  what the Bosch project called familiar little monsters, like a figure with a spoonbill beak, a toad clambering out of the water and a floating sausage.But the key to the upgrade of the paintings authorship to master from follower lay beneath the surface, researchers said.Bosch was constantly reworking his paintings, covering over or wiping out whole scenes from earlier drafts. Mr. Ilsink and his team were able to visualize those layers, using infrared photography and infrared reflectography, and they said that the St. Anthony underdrawings perfectly match those from other panels in Boschs core oeuvre in style, composition and brush work."}
{"text": "Well, in my pre-Iowa notes I called the Republican primary right:I know what will happen on the Republican side: someone horrifying will come in first, and someone horrifying will come in second.Let me add that someone horrifying also came in third. Marco Rubio may seem less radical than Cruz or Trump, but his substantive policy positions are for incredibly hawkish foreign policy, wildly regressive tax policy, kicking tens of millions of people off health insurance, and destroying the environment. Other than that, hes a moderate.On the Democratic side, I was glad to see Nate Cohn, whos a professional here, reach the same conclusions I got in my amateur analysis: this still looks like Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.The point is not just that she eked out a very narrow win in Iowa, which is important mainly for limiting the doomsaying spin the media were so eager to deliver. It is that this situation doesnt look at all like 2008.People tend to forget that the 2008 primary was quite close all the way through; Clinton actually got more votes than Obama, but lost the delegate count through careless organization that wont be repeated.  And the crucial role of Iowa there was that it persuaded African-American voters to switch en masse. Its hard to see that happening this time.That said, Sanders is tapping into something that moves a lot of Democrats, and which Clinton needs to try for as well. Can she?Certainly taking a harder line on the corruption of our politics by big money is important  and no, giving some paid speeches doesnt disqualify her from making that case. (Cue furious attack from the Bernie bros.) Substantively, her financial reform ideas are as tough as his, just different in focus. What is true, though, is that simply by having been in the world of movers and shakers for so long, Clinton cant project the kind of purity that someone who has been an outsider (even while sitting in the Senate) can manage.The bigger problem, though, to my mind at least, is the ability to deliver a message of dramatic uplift, the promise that electing your favorite candidate will cause a dramatic change in the world. How do you do that if your reality sense tells you that only incremental progress is possible, at least for now? You probably cant. (Im pretty bad at the uplift thing myself). To be blunt, I think Sanders is selling an illusion, but its an illusion many people want to believe in, and theres no easy way to counter that.In the end, again, Clintons tell-it-like-it-is approach will probably be enough to clinch the nomination. And then shell be in a very different position, running as the champion of real if limited progress against, well, look at those top three on the other side."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES   After five days on the run, two of the three inmates who had broken out of an Orange County jail came to blows as they argued over whether to kill a taxi driver they had kidnapped in Southern California and taken with them to San Jose.One escaped inmate, Hossein Nayeri, 37, apparently wanted to kill the taxi driver and bury his body, law enforcement officials said. But another escapee, Bac Duong, 43, objected, and the two fought inside the motel room where they were hiding on Wednesday.The altercation proved to be a turning point in the statewide hunt for the three escapees, who had broken out of the Orange County Central Mens Jail on Jan. 22. All three now face charges for the escape.When Mr. Nayeri and the third escapee, Jonathan Tieu, 20, left the motel on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Duong and the cabdriver took off. The two drove back to Southern California, where Mr. Duong turned himself in on Friday morning, according to Orange County Sheriffs Department officials. The other fugitives were recaptured the next day.With all three men back in the jail from which they escaped  this time in isolation  Sheriffs Department officials on Monday laid out a timeline of the eight days they spent on the run.Planning for the escape began in July, said Capt. Jeff Hallock, a spokesman for the department, and included coordination with people both inside and outside the jail.Captain Hallock said Mr. Nayeri had developed a relationship with Nooshafarin Ravaghi, 44, who taught English as a second language to inmates. Investigators arrested Ms. Ravaghi last week and said she had provided information like Google maps that assisted in the escape. But on Monday, the district attorney, Tony Rackauckas, said that there was not enough evidence to charge Ms. Ravaghi and that she would be released.Loc Ba Nguyen, an associate of Mr. Duongs, has been charged with smuggling weapons and tools into the jail in January, before the escape. The three inmates cut metal bars to escape their cell, then rappelled from the roof using makeshift rope early on Jan. 22.Once on the outside, Mr. Nguyen picked them up about half a mile from the jail, Captain Hallock said.During that first day, they bounced between some residential locations in Orange County, Captain Hallock said. We believe they obtained some money from family members or associates.At 9:30 that night, shortly after the Sheriffs Department realized the men had escaped, the fugitives called a taxi to take them to Rosemead, east of Los Angeles. Mr. Duong stuck a gun in the cabdrivers ribs and told him that he was coming with them, and the four of them spent the night at an undisclosed location, officials said.For the next couple of days, the escapees moved around Los Angeles County, where they visited a hair salon in an effort to change their appearances, stole a white utility van and spent several nights at a hotel in Rosemead. On Monday, they drove north to the Alameda Motel in San Jose, Captain Hallock said, taking the taxi driver and his cab with them. The men remained in that motel until the fight on Wednesday, Captain Hallock said.Then, when Mr. Nayeri and Mr. Tieu went to get the windows of the stolen van tinted on Thursday, Mr. Duong and the taxi driver headed back to Rosemead, where they stayed for a night, before Mr. Duong surrendered. Meanwhile, sheriffs officials had put out an alert for the stolen van, and on Friday, after Mr. Duongs recapture, they notified the public that the men were believed to be in Northern California.On Saturday morning, a man in San Francisco spotted the van parked at a Whole Foods Market and notified two officers, who approached the vehicle. Mr. Nayeri ran and was captured after a short chase; Mr. Tieu was found hiding in the van. The two men were returned to Orange County early Sunday.Before the escape, Mr. Nayeri faced charges of kidnapping and torture in connection with the abduction of a marijuana dispensary owner in 2012. He had been held without bond since 2014.Mr. Duong is charged with attempted murder, and had been held without bond since December. Mr. Tieu is charged with murder and attempted murder, and had been held since 2013."}
{"text": "The stock market recovered from steep losses early to close slightly lower on Monday as investors looked past another steep drop in the price of oil and renewed concerns about economic growth in China and the United States.Oil and gas companies remained in the red.The fact that utility and other high-dividend stocks were among the better performers should be seen as a sign that investors still dont have much conviction behind last weeks gains and Mondays recovery, traders said.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,449.18 after being down roughly 150 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poors 500-stock index fell 0.86 point, less than 0.1 percent, to 1,939.38, and the Nasdaq composite rose 6.41 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,620.37.Stocks had been lower most of the day after separate reports showed manufacturing slowing last month in both the United States and China. The reports initially caused a sell-off in commodities, notably energy and industrial metals like copper. The price of United States benchmark oil plunged $2, or 5.9 percent, to $31.62 a barrel in New York. Natural gas also fell about 7 percent.But as the trading day drew to a close, investors began to buy up utilities and other dividend-paying stocks. The Dow Jones utility index, a collection of 15 utility companies, rose nearly 1 percent on Monday. Telecommunications stocks, another traditional dividend play, posted the second-biggest gains in the S.&P. 500.J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, said part of the reason dividend stocks did better than the rest of the market was speculation that the Federal Reserve, faced with a more uncertain economy, would probably not raise interest rates as fast as investors had thought at the beginning of the year.Dividend stocks perform poorly when interest rates are rising, because the value of the yield on dividend stocks is worn away as yields rise on bonds and other dividend-paying investments.Were looking at probably only two raises this year instead of four, and that makes dividend stocks look relatively attractive again, Mr. Kinahan said, referring to the Feds adjustment of interest rates.Energy stocks, not surprisingly, were the biggest losers on Monday, following the price of oil lower. The energy component of the S.&P. 500 fell nearly 2 percent, while the performance of the broader market was nearly flat.Southwestern Energy shares declined 39 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $8.50, Transocean stock dropped 63 cents, or 6 percent, to $9.79 and Chesapeake Energy fell 18 cents, or 5 percent, to $3.21.In other company news, stock in Alere jumped $16.91, or 45 percent, to $54.11 after Abbott Laboratories announced it was purchasing the health care company, which focuses on diagnostics, for $5.8 billion. Abbotts shares rose 60 cents, or 2 percent, to $38.45.United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.95 percent. The dollar fell to 120.99 yen from 121.05 yen on Friday. The euro strengthened to $1.0893 from $1.0831.Prices for precious and industrial metals closed mixed. Gold rose $11.50 to $1,127.90 an ounce, silver gained 10 cents to $14.37 an ounce and copper slipped a penny to $2.06 a pound.In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4.9 cents to close at $1.083 a gallon, heating oil fell 4.2 cents to $1.037 a gallon and natural gas lost 2 cents, to close at $2.14 per 1,000 cubic feet. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, fell $1.86, to $34.13 a barrel."}
{"text": "The Screen Actors Guild Awards were handed out over the weekend and managed in one fell swoop to both clarify and muddy the Oscars race.On the clarity front: Leonardo DiCaprio (The Revenant) and Brie Larson (Room) continued their king and queen of the prom awards-season sweep, with each collecting a SAG Award for the first time. At this stage of the game, if they dont go on to win Oscars, many hats with be eaten en masse.The belle of the ball, Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl), landed best supporting actress, making her Academy prospects rosier than ever. The Bagger dares say only Rooney Mara (Carol) stands in her way.And, while the guilds best supporting actor winner has gone on to the land that Oscar the past 7 of 10 years, the chances of years winner, Idris Elba, doing the same are zero, as he didnt get an Oscar nomination. (You mightve heard.)Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Elba said, at one point, from the stage, standing alongside his Beasts of No Nation co-star Abraham Attah, Welcome to diverse TV.Indeed Queen Latifah, Uzo Aduba and Viola Davis all walked away with SAGs for performances on the small screen. Mr. Elba did especially, swimmingly Saturday night, taking home a second SAG for his lead performance in the BBCs Luther.But as for the almighty best picture race at the Oscars, it now stands, more than ever, as exactly that: a race, because the signs are pointing all over the place.The Golden Globes split the baby between The Revenant for best drama and The Martian for best comedy. The Producers Guild anointed The Big Short. On Saturday, SAG-AFTRA  which has some 160,000 members  gave Spotlight its best ensemble prize. A day earlier, the American Cinema Editors  whose awards are closely watched, because their best dramatic film picks usually go on to win best picture  named Mad Max: Fury Road as the years best drama and The Big Short, for comedy.So all that can be said with certainty at this point is that the Oscar for best picture is assuredly going to a movie about a guy or a bunch of guys on a mission (perhaps with a lady thrown in, too)."}
{"text": "SFX Entertainment, the company created four years ago to capitalize on the popularity of dance music festivals, declared bankruptcy on Monday, after a troubled year in which the companys founder abandoned a takeover bid and its stock plunged by more than 95 percent.The bankruptcy reorganization will take the company private, eliminate more than $300 million in debt from its balance sheet and install a new chief executive to replace Robert F.X. Sillerman, who founded SFX in 2012 with a dream of creating a media empire around dance music.As part of the deal, a group of the companys bondholders will convert their debt into equity and provide $115 million in financing. According to an announcement, the companys many festivals around the world, including Electric Zoo, Tomorrowland, Mysteryland and Stereosonic, will go on as planned, and other businesses, like its digital music store Beatport, will remain operational.This expression of confidence from our lenders is testimonial to the vibrancy and potential of our business, Mr. Sillerman said in a statement. Of course this was not where we thought wed be, but with this restructuring we have the opportunity to achieve all that SFX can and will be.Mr. Sillerman, who owns about 40 percent of the companys shares according to his most recent filings, said that he would remain the chairman of SFX and that the company would begin searching for a new chief executive immediately.The bankruptcy, which in recent weeks had been the subject of speculation in the music world and on Wall Street, brings to an end a painful stretch for SFX and Mr. Sillerman, who hoped to repeat the success he had two decades ago with an earlier incarnation of SFX Entertainment. In that company, he combined concert promoters around the country and in 2000 sold the enterprise to the broadcaster Clear Channel  now known as iHeartMedia  for $4.4 billion. That network of promoters and theaters remains the basis of Live Nation Entertainments concert division.But the new version of SFX has been much more troubled. The company raised $260 million in an initial public offering in late 2013, but investors grew impatient with its efforts to build a profitable business by attracting corporate sponsors. Events like a Las Vegas edition of the Brazilian festival Rock in Rio also had disappointing results.Nothing ever materialized in the fundamentals with this company, said Steven Azarbad of Maglan Capital, a hedge fund that sold its holdings in SFX last year. It became a show me story at some point.Last year, Mr. Sillerman offered to take the company private at $5.25 a share, valuing the company at $774 million, including its debt. But investors doubted that Mr. Sillerman had lined up the proper financing, and the companys shares began to plunge. By August, Mr. Sillerman abandoned his bid, and problems continued to mount through the fall. Last month the company disclosed that it was in default because it had failed to make a $3 million payment on a $10.8 million promissory note.SFXs reorganization raises questions about the future of the company, including whether pieces of it will be bought by rivals in the concert and live-entertainment businesses. Last year, while Mr. Sillermans takeover bid was being considered by the board, the company disclosed that it had received interest from bidders for parts of its business, but did not identify the parties.Despite SFXs problems, the dance-music world has largely remained strong. Festivals like Coachella, which involve many dance acts as headliners, are still popular, and by one estimate the global market for dance music, including recordings, live performances, endorsements and other deals, is worth $6.9 billion a year."}
{"text": "INDIANOLA, Iowa   The brightly lit high school cafeteria began to fill up shortly before 6 p.m., and the menu board advertising hot dogs and turkey fritters was soon hidden by a campaign sign for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (An anti-bullying poster remained.)Only a handful of Democratic voters showed up to caucus here four years ago as President Obama sought re-election. This year, with a competitive race, the Seventh Precinct chairman, Chris Nelson, was expecting up to 100.Mr. Nelson, who builds vending machines at a nearby factory, was fresh off a trip to the dentist. No teeth were pulled. I dont want to sit up there with a drooling kind of look, Mr. Nelson, 53, said with a laugh.On the other side of the cafeteria, a separate caucus was gathering, and battle lines were drawn: Supporters of Hillary Clinton to one side, Sanders supporters to the other, and Martin OMalley  the candidate least likely to meet the so-called viability threshold of 15 percent of attendees  in the middle, positionally up for grabs.5:40 P.M. As a precinct captain for the first time, Steve Rose memorized talking points from the Sanders campaign and studied a math sheet on viability counts (paid for by Bernie 2016  not the billionaires), his sights set on converting OMalley supporters who might find themselves in need of a new candidate.He arrived here with other enticements as well: Rice Krispies Treats, miniature cinnamon buns and sandwiches from the local Hy-Vee supermarket. This is Iowa, so I brought some food and water to appeal to the basic needs, said Mr. Rose, an education professor at Simpson College in Indianola. Well be there for a couple hours.Mr. Rose, whose wife, Mary Jones, was a precinct captain for Senator Barack Obama in 2008, ruefully recalled losing out on some supporters because a rival campaign had brought homemade sandwiches.7:02 P.M. The chairman, Mr. Nelson, raps his hand on a table and calls the caucus to order. The eyes of the nation are on us tonight, he says. And the world, too, I might add. The count is announced: 137 eligible voters, meaning candidates will need 21 voters to remain viable.At least one voter remains undecided. Jennifer Eaton says she still has not made up her mind: Ill probably go with who I think can win against whoever the Republicans put up.Ms. Eaton is far more familiar with the site of this caucus than most. She works as a lunch lady in the cafeteria. Looking at the crowded tables, it hits her. Theyre not going to put them back in the right spot! she said.7:21 P.M. There are 18 people in the OMalley corner, under the viability threshold. Elsewhere, two undecided voters are being buttonholed by Betty Crawford, the Clinton precinct captain. Ms. Eaton, the lunch lady, is one of them. The email thing concerns me, the Benghazi thing concerns me, she says. (The email thing has been all cleared up! a member of the Clinton team says.)Margaret Vernon, 72, the caucus secretary and an OMalley supporter, approached Ms. Eaton from the side. Thats why you may want to consider Martin OMalley, she says, smiling. He doesnt have that baggage.7:25 P.M. Nicholas Webb, 31, a lawyer who supports Mr. OMalley, looks glum. Were not going to make it, he says. Several Clinton supporters have gathered to persuade the members to defect. Suddenly, Mr. Rose, the Sanders captain, is there, too: Bernie is a whole more in your camp than Hillary is.Then, a reprieve. Mr. Nelson says that to be fair, he will allow 10 extra minutes for the OMalley group to find the three extra votes they need to stay viable. Ms. Vernon makes a beeline back to Ms. Eaton, the uncommitted voter, and before long, cheers rise up: She has drifted over to the OMalley corner, welcomed with warm pats on the back.7:35 P.M. Twenty-one! The OMalley gang has collected the extra votes it needed. Their success, however, is as much about pragmatism as principle. If hes viable, it takes one away from Bernie, says Albert Brooks, an Uber driver who switched from Mrs. Clinton to Mr. OMalley.7:54 P.M. Two separate counts of voters suggest a Clinton victory, but the vote totals are off. Some of those who voted, it turned out, had not registered.At last, the final count is at hand. Mrs. Clinton, with 63 votes, is 10 ahead of Mr. Sanders; she receives five delegates to his four, and Mr. OMalley ekes out one. An exodus ensues as voters grab their jackets and head out, hoping to be home ahead of an impending snowstorm.8 P.M. The room is almost completely deserted  democracy accomplished in an hour flat. Its hard not to win, says Mr. Rose, the Sanders captain. But after Bernie leaves office in eight years, OMalley will be a real good candidate."}
{"text": "NASHUA, N.H.  Chris Christie on Tuesday morning did not seem like a man who had finished near the back of the pack with 1.8 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses the night before.Im in a peppy mood this morning, said the New Jersey governor at his first appearance of the day in New Hampshire.With dim chances for a sizable showing in Iowa, Mr. Christie long ago pinned his hopes on a respectable performance in New Hampshire, where he was already campaigning on Monday afternoon, even before the caucuses in Iowa opened.Early Tuesday morning, Mr. Christie was on the stump in Nashua, delivering the keynote speech at the Salvation Armys annual Groundhog Day Breakfast and appearing undeterred by the lackluster finish in Iowa.I am pleased to announce that I performed exactly as I expected in Iowa, Mr. Christie told a questioner who asked his view on Monday nights results, adding that Iowa was in the rearview mirror.For me, thats a joyous announcement, he said.A day earlier, Mr. Christie placed 10th in Iowa, just behind former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who dropped out of the race at the end of the night, and ahead of only Rick Santorum and Jim Gilmore.Those results make New Hampshire, with its primary next Tuesday, essentially a make-or-break state for Mr. Christie, a point that was visible as he embarked on a schedule on Tuesday of five public events, from Nashua to Bedford to Manchester.As he spoke to the Salvation Army, he noted that it was his 67th day in New Hampshire  which he said was more than any other candidate  and he called it the emphasis of our campaign.Still, he offered his opinion of the Iowa results, saying he was not very surprised with the pecking order of Ted Cruz-Donald Trump-Marco Rubio.Mr. Christie said Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, needed to win Iowa  and did. And he said did not expect a victory for Mr. Trump, saying that after meeting with Iowans he did not believe they were all of a sudden going to vote for a billionaire real estate developer.Bad morning for Donald, he said.When it came to Mr. Rubios performance, Mr. Christie said he was in his hotel room on Monday night watching the Florida senators speech, and from his tone, Mr. Christie thought that he had come out ahead.Im like, hey, did Marco win? Mr. Christie said. No, he came in third!Mr. Christies analysis even extended to the Democratic side. He called the night a good one for Hillary Clinton, and a setback for Bernie Sanders. Iowas demographics made it a winnable state and a missed opportunity for Mr. Sanders, he said.The Vermont senator is expected to do well in New Hampshire, where voters are familiar with him, but nonetheless, Mr. Christie said, If he cant win in Iowa, where else is he going to win?"}
{"text": "Maybe you have seen television ads starring the beefy, affable comedian and actor known as Larry the Cable Guy.In his sleeveless shirt and gimme cap, hes driving a monster truck or streaking along on a jet ski, pausing to chomp on a turkey drumstick or a barbecued rib, all the while proclaiming his love for America and for Prilosec OTC to fight frequent heartburn.The caution that the drug should be taken for no more than 14 days, and not more often than every four months, appears briefly on-screen. If you blink or go fetch your glasses, youll miss it.Todd Semla has noticed the ads, too, and hes not a fan. I dont see Larry the Cable Guy saying, If you take this drug often, your kidneys may be affected or you could break a hip, said Dr. Semla, a pharmacist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, and past president of the American Geriatrics Society.Since their introduction in 1990, the drugs collectively known as proton pump inhibitors (common brand names: Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec) have become among the most frequently prescribed in the country; as the Cable Guy points out, they are also available over the counter. They suppress stomach acid more effectively than a previous class of drugs called H2 blockers (Zantac, Tagamet, Pepcid).They have also given users reason to be wary. In recent years, scores of studies have reported associations between prescription P.P.I. use and an array of health problems, including bone fractures, low magnesium levels, kidney injuries and possibly cardiovascular drug interactions.They are also linked to infections, like the stubborn Clostridium difficile and pneumonia. Reducing the acidity of the stomach, researchers believe, allows bacteria to thrive and then spread to other organs like the lungs and intestines.The latest findings, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, point to increased risk of chronic kidney disease among users, which is particularly worrisome.You can treat and hopefully cure infections, said Dr. Adam Schoenfeld, an internal medicine resident at the University of California, San Francisco, and an author of an accompanying editorial on the drugs adverse effects. Fractures can heal, though they can be catastrophic events for older people. But chronic kidney disease doesnt go away.The new study, by a Johns Hopkins team, compiled years of data from two sources: a community sample of 10,482 adults in four communities in North Carolina, Mississippi, Minnesota and Maryland (average age: 63) and a cohort of nearly 250,000 patients in a rural Pennsylvania health care system. Those who took prescription proton pump inhibitors were 20 percent to 50 percent more likely to develop chronic kidney disease than nonusers, said the senior author, Dr. Morgan Grams, a nephrologist and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.Like the rest of these drug studies, this one demonstrated an association, not a direct cause. But in the Pennsylvania sample, the researchers documented a dose effect: The risk of chronic kidney disease rose 15 percent among those taking the drug once a day, but 46 percent in those taking it twice daily, compared with nonusers. That leads us to believe theres a causal effect, Dr. Grams said.Relative risk statistics sometimes seem to exaggerate the dangers of a drug or an illness, if they were low to begin with. But kidney disease is quite common, particularly among older adults, Dr. Grams pointed out. And the P.P.I.-using population is vast, she added. When you have 15 million people using these drugs, even relatively rare adverse effects can affect a lot of people.Older people should probably pay special heed. They are more likely to have reflux, Dr. Semla said, in part because the muscle that prevents stomach acid from rising into the esophagus weakens with age. Older adults are therefore more likely to take these drugs, and also more vulnerable to the diseases and disorders associated with them, especially with long-term use.All of this led an American Geriatrics Society panel last year to add proton pump inhibitors to the list called the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults, citing the risk of bone loss and fractures and C. diff infection.The Food and Drug Administration has also issued several safety announcements about these drugs association with C. diff, fracture risk and low magnesium, linked to kidney disease and other ailments.So youd think use of proton pump inhibitors would be declining. Its not.Despite this information, those drugs are extremely overprescribed, Dr. Schoenfeld said.From 1999 to 2002, 9 percent of people ages 55 to 64 reported using a prescription gastric reflux drug (including non-P.P.I.s) in the previous 30 days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported.Ten years later, the proportion had risen to 16 percent. Among prescription medications, only cardiac and cholesterol drugs were more commonly used by adults ages 55 to 64.Proton pump inhibitors can be crucial medications, doctors hasten to point out, for those with peptic ulcers or for intensive care patients, among others. Theyre also the most effective option for severe reflux. But whether over the counter or prescribed (prescriptions can involve higher doses), they are usually recommended for short-term use.Yet there are definitely older people whove been on these for 10 or 20 years, Dr. Schoenfeld said. Perhaps the medication was prescribed during a hospital stay, then never discontinued. Or a patient took a nonprescription version for a bout of indigestion, felt better and therefore kept taking it, though the initial problem may have long ago disappeared. Doctors, too, often fail to question extended use, Dr. Schoenfeld said.Regularly reviewing all medications, prescription and over the counter, at office visits might help reduce this overuse. Dr. Schoenfeld recommends tapering off a proton pump inhibitor to see if its still needed, or switching to one of the less potent H2 blockers, which dont appear to entail the same risks.Better yet, nonpharmacological approaches can often reduce heartburn and other reflux-related problems. Losing weight helps; so does limiting certain medications, like aspirin.

{"text": "SAN DIEGO   Brandt Snedeker won the praise of his peers for a closing round at Torrey Pines that left them in awe.Now he has a trophy to show for it.Snedeker won the Farmers Insurance Open on Monday when the conditions turned out to be just as tough as when he shot his 69 on Sunday, a score that was roughly nine shots better than the field average.Jimmy Walker had a one-shot lead on Snedeker and K. J. Choi when the final round resumed after strong winds had toppled about a dozen trees on the South Course. With a powerful wind from the opposite direction, Walker and Choi tried to hang on with pars and could not.The way the wind blew and made those last five holes play so tough on those guys, I feel bad for them, Snedeker said. They got the raw end of the stick this morning. But thats just the way golf goes, and luckily enough, I played good enough yesterday to get the job done. So its a special feeling, to say the least.Snedeker won at six-under-par 282, the highest winning score at Torrey Pines since Fuzzy Zoellers 282 in 1979. The average score was 77.9, the highest fourth-round average at a regular PGA Tour event since the tour began keeping such statistics in 1983.Snedeker won for the second time at Torrey Pines. He played the final 17 holes without a bogey in winds of more than 40 miles per hour and occasional rain that forced suspension of play three times before the South Course was evacuated.Of the 23 players who finished on Sunday, there were 11 rounds in the 80s."}
{"text": "Settlements by Barclays and Credit Suisse for misrepresenting their private stock trading sites to customers are unlikely to be the last as regulators continue to pursue abuses in electronic trading.At the heart of the cases are so-called dark pools, a nefarious-sounding term for an activity that actually plays a big role in the way equities markets work. About 42 percent of the average daily trade volume is handled in the dark, according to the Tabb Group, a data and research firm. That means no information about the trades is known publicly before they are executed.Conversely, 58 percent of an average days trades are done on the lit, or public, markets like the major United States stock exchanges, where transactions can be seen by brokers and other market dealers before they are completed. The Tabb Group says last years overall average daily trade volume (both lit and dark) was 6.9 billion shares a day.Firms like Barclays and Credit Suisse operate dark pools for customers who want to buy and sell stock without other traders finding out what they are up to before a transaction takes place. These types of dark pools handle 13.6 percent of daily trading, the Tabb Group says.A pension fund with a large block of stock to sell, for example, would want that transaction to be handled as confidentially as possible to avoid affecting the price of the shares until all or most of them could be unloaded.Although dark pools have existed for decades, they have become more popular in recent years as high-speed electronic trading has ruled the markets. Supersophisticated computers can search various public exchanges in fractions of a second, ferreting out trades from the moment they are initiated until they are completed. That ability has enabled competing buyers and sellers to react to the trades while they are in progress.An aspect of the accusations against Credit Suisse was echoed in an earlier case settled by Citigroups LavaFlow alternative trading system in 2014. Both Credit Suisse and Citi were accused of using information about hidden customer orders to inform trades through computers known as smart-order routers, which continuously hunt for the best way to execute a trade.In Credit Suisses instance, information about customer orders sitting in its dark pool waiting to be completed was sent to its smart-order router and another router designed to detect interest from other traders.That information leakage is what dark pools are supposed to guard against.What regulators have focused on are the promises the dark pool operators have made to customers about how their orders are being handled and whether high-speed trading firms have the opportunity to trade against those orders. In November, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules that would force dark pools to be more explicit about how they handle customer orders.So far, the S.E.C. has settled several cases, most of them having to do with the disclosures and representations firms made to customers about their dark pools. In addition to Barclays and Credit Suisse, other cases include the one against Citis LavaFlow, another against Liquidnet, one against UBS last year, and a more recent one against ITG, which held the previous record for a dark pool fine.The Barclays and Credit Suisse settlements, totaling $154.3 million, are the largest to date.At a news conference on Monday, both Andrew J. Ceresney, the S.E.Cs director of enforcement, and Eric T. Schneiderman, New Yorks attorney general, said other investigations were continuing. The two jointly announced the Barclays and Credit Suisse settlements. New York first sued Barclays over issues regarding its dark pool in 2014.This is an area where both of our institutions are focused, Mr. Ceresney said.For its part, while it admitted violations of securities laws in settling its case, Barclays got approval for waivers that would preserve its status as a well-known seasoned issuer, which means it benefits from a streamlined process for filing securities registrations. Without the waivers, it could have been classified an ineligible issuer, which is the status conferred to companies with black marks against them."}

{"text": "Philip B. Corbett is the associate masthead editor for standards and oversees The Timess style manual.Most queries I receive as overseer of The Timess style guidelines involve the mechanics of language. Do you capitalize the word after a colon? Should the verb in this clause be subjunctive?Occasionally, the issues have social or political resonance  courtesy titles for transgender people, or English renderings of foreign place names.One question last week, though, raised a philosophical issue. Is a cow a who or a which?My answer (as a stylebook editor, not a philosopher): It depends.The query came from Peter Singer, the Princeton philosopher and intellectual champion of the animal-rights movement. He said that in his own writing, he used who to emphasize the notion of animals as individuals. He was pleasantly surprised, he said, to see this headline on The Timess website, with an Associated Press article about an escaped cow in Queens:Cow Who Escaped New York Slaughterhouse Finds SanctuaryDoes The Times have a policy on the use of that or who for animals? Professor Singer wondered.We do, though it doesnt go as far as he would recommend. We generally use person pronouns like he, she or who only for animals who have been given a name, or in cases where the sex of the animal is specified. Otherwise, we stick with it and that or which. Here is our stylebook entry on this point, which is in line with The Associated Presss guidelines as well:Professor Singers use of who for animals fits into his overall perspective on animal-rights issues. In our style guidelines, though, our goal is not to advance any particular agenda or point of view but to reflect widely accepted, familiar usage among our readers. And it seems most common for English speakers to reserve he, she and who for animals with whom we feel a personal connection. Otherwise, it, that and which seem to be the norm.In the case of the cow in Queens, in fact, it seems our editors were caught between the two impulses. Freddy, as the animal was dubbed, was elevated to who in the headline, but remained a mere that in the lead sentence of the story.In an exchange of emails, Professor Singer said he thought usage on this point might be gradually shifting. Google searches, he said, revealed a large number of uses of who with nondomesticated animals, including deer and ants.The little item about the bovine runaway in Queens raised another usage question, noted by Professor Singer and some other readers: Was that animal really a cow?Oddly, despite the ubiquity of domesticated cattle, there isnt a common nongendered singular term in English for the animal. The primary sense of cow, of course, is an adult female. Freddy the runaway, like many beef cattle, was apparently a castrated male (young male and female animals are also used for meat).But most dictionaries  as well as common usage  accept cow as a generic term in casual or colloquial uses. So if you see such an animal running down the street in Queens, its safe to shout Runaway cow! even if you dont have time to verify the sex."}

{"text": "Just as the Iowa caucuses, the first official test of the 2016 presidential election, begin, and with the New Hampshire primary looming next week, a new study has been released that looks at the candidates and their appeal in a somewhat different light. To be specific: a fashion light.On Monday, the Global Language Monitor, a Texas-based company that tracks word usage online, unveiled its first presidential candidates fashion study, which ranks perceptions of the candidates according to the following categories: presidential style, off-the-rack style, prt--porter (designer) style and overall style.The company says the results were culled from billions of web pages, millions of blogs, the top 375,000 global print and electronic media, and new social media formats across the English-speaking linguasphere.And the overall winner is  Donald Trump! By a wide margin.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas came in second, followed closely by Hillary Clinton, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Jeb Bush.No surprise there. Mr. Trump is the most talked-about candidate over all on pretty much every subject, so a trouncing would be expected. Just as the fact that Martin OMalley barely figures on any of the graphs makes a certain amount of sense.But there are some unexpected nuggets. For example: Mr. Christie is in a dead heat with Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump in presidential style.Mr. Christie: dark horse. Maybe all his hammering home that he has had executive experience has paid off.Similarly, its notable that, despite all the discussion of her clothes, and the relatively pricey Ralph Lauren outfit she wore at her opening campaign rally, Mrs. Clinton tops the off-the-rack category, suggesting her image is associated with less expensive and less polished fashion choices.Shes also fifth in the prt--porter ranking  after Messrs. Christie, Cruz and Trump, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (who was included because his possible candidacy was a factor earlier in the race)  which lends credence to the idea that her clothing is not considered a major issue.And when it comes to both presidential style and prt--porter, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont trails Mrs. Clinton by only a tiny margin, suggesting, said Paul J. J. Payack, the founder of the Global Language Monitor, that he has a style that is recognizably his own, which people identify.(Oddly, given his formerly rumpled appearance, Mr. Sanders ranks quite far down on the off-the-rack scale  a standard that would seem to favor the less than fashionable  which may mean his recent more polished look has actually had a real effect.)Pointedly, too, Mr. Bush seems not quite as irrelevant to these rankings as recent reports of his weakness may lead one to assume. Whereas Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is near or in the bottom half in almost every category, despite his bootgate moment last month.Admittedly, this could all be a bit of fun, as Mr. Payack called it, and not reflective of what is really going on in voters minds (and it does include conversations that take place abroad, and thus may not affect the primary season).But it is telling that the Global Language Monitor, which has analyzed President Obamas speeches, as well as tracked a number of political narratives including the BP oil spill, decided to turn its attention to fashion.Optics increasingly play an important role in elections, as even the candidates staffs admit, Mr. Payack said. The worlds attitude toward fashion has changed greatly. Image is key, thanks to ubiquitous cellphones, combined with social media like Facebook, Twitter and Vine, so an analysis of each candidates sartorial choices is a meaningful area of investigation.He said he was surprised by some of the findings, especially Mr. Christies showing.But a few years ago, when we were looking at words of the year, sustainability came up, and everyone thought, oh, thats weird  and now sustainability is everywhere, Mr. Payack said. So often, word usage can reflect an upcoming trend.Guess well find out, as the results start rolling in."}
{"text": "Escalating homicide rates in Mexico are affecting the countrys average life expectancy.According to research published in the journal Health Affairs, the life expectancy for Mexican men aged 15 to 50 fell by 0.6 percent from 2005 to 2010.In most countries, homicides do commonly occur, particularly among young people, said Hiram Beltrn-Snchez, a professor of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the lead author of the study. What is unusual, though, is for homicides to have such a large impact at the national level.In 2005, Mexicos murder rate was 9.5 per 100,000 people, but by 2010, that figure had more than doubled, to 22 per 100,000. That shift coincides with the beginning of a new national security strategy in 2006, which aimed to dismantle criminal organizations, Dr. Beltrn-Snchez said.We suspect that the rise in homicides has to do with those policies, which we hope will be discontinued.As in most countries around the world, improvements in health care, living standards and nutrition had increased life expectancy in Mexico, which rose by four to five years per decade from 1940 to 2000. Had that pattern held, Mexican men, whose life expectancy at birth was about 72 years in 2000, should have averaged 76 or 77 years in 2010.Instead, Dr. Beltrn-Snchez and his colleagues found that life expectancy had held steady over that time. For women during the same period, life expectancy increased by less than a year  from about 77 to 78 years  rather than the 5.5 years seen in past decades.According to Dr. Beltrn-Snchezs analysis, life expectancy seemed to be on the rise from 2000 to 2005, but from 2005 to 2010, many states, especially those at the center of the drug war, had a drastic reversal.The average life expectancy for men in the states of Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Durango, for example, fell by three years over those five years. Chihuahua averaged more than 20 deaths per 1,000 males under age 75.The life expectancy among women in those states was also affected, falling by three to six months.Because of the surplus of missing-person reports in Mexico, Dr. Beltrn-Snchez and his colleagues consider their results a conservative estimate of homicides true effect on life expectancy.We dont know if missing individuals are already dead or still alive, Dr. Beltrn-Snchez said. So what were finding, although dramatic, is not as bad as it could actually be.Dr. Beltrn-Snchez suspects that even sharper trends are playing out in other nations where homicide rates have recently shot up, including El Salvador and Honduras.Our next step is to try to get our hands on data from other Central American countries, he said. Getting reliable data that actually reflect whats going on is always the issue."}
{"text": "Most money managers clamor for companies to provide detailed guidance on their next quarter, down to the penny  but not the worlds largest investor.Laurence D. Fink, co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, which with more than $4.6 trillion in assets under management makes it the worlds largest investor, sent a letter to 500 chief executives late Monday urging them for the first time to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates.Todays culture of quarterly earnings hysteria is totally contrary to the long-term approach we need, Mr. Fink wrote.The proposal, a provocative recommendation from the influential Wall Street executive, is aimed at trying to curb companies short-term focus on quarterly results.To be clear, we do believe companies should still report quarterly results  long-termism should not be a substitute for transparency, he said. But C.E.O.s should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their E.P.S. targets or analyst consensus estimates. (E.P.S. stands for earnings per share.)Mr. Fink has made a series of proposals over the last several years to encourage longer-term thinking by companies, including a plan to change the tax code and the treatment of capital gains. But his latest proposition goes further than his previous efforts.While Mr. Fink wants to eliminate quarterly guidance, he is also making perhaps an even more controversial request, asking chief executives and company boards to provide a a strategic framework for long-term value creation that could extend to multiple years. In other words, a company should give shareholders a detailed long-term plan for its business.Annual shareholder letters and other communications to shareholders are too often backwards-looking and dont do enough to articulate managements vision and plans for the future, Mr. Fink wrote. Without management providing a road map for the next few years, he said, some short-term investors (and analysts) offer more compelling visions for companies than the companies themselves, allowing these perspectives to fill the void and build support for potentially destabilizing actions.Activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to return money to shareholders or buy back shares. Last year through the end of the third quarter, according to Mr. Fink, buybacks skyrocketed 27 percent over the previous year, which itself had been a record. Companies that buy back shares reduce the amount of stock they have outstanding, a move that can have the effect of increasing earnings per share and the stakes of existing shareholders.Mr. Finks call comes at a time of stepped-up chatter among big investors and other business leaders to try to encourage companies and investors to be less focused on short-term efforts to lift earnings. Critics of buybacks question whether the purchases are a productive use of profits, rather than investing in their businesses and creating jobs.BlackRock, along with other mutual fund giants like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, recently held a meeting with Warren E. Buffett at the invitation of JPMorgan Chases chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to devise a series of voluntary standards that companies should adopt, according to people briefed on the meetings. Another meeting is planned for next month. The discussion of short-termism on Wall Street has also become part of the presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton made a policy speech last year that endorsed many of the ideas Mr. Fink had raised. There has long been speculation that Mr. Fink could eventually land a senior government post in Washington.In an interview, Mr. Fink said he wrote this letter now to get ahead of proxy season, a period during the spring when many companies hold their annual meetings and vote on shareholder resolutions. He hopes to influence how chief executives discuss their companies performance and goals in their annual letters to shareholders.Of course, some companies in fast-moving businesses like technology might argue that it is impossible to present a multiyear road map without telegraphing plans to rivals.Mr. Fink dismissed that possibility. I dont think a public discourse on how a companys C.E.O. sees their position is going to result in proprietary secrets being revealed.He doesnt want to put all of the responsibility on the chief executive. His letter presses company boards to publicly affirm the chief executives long-term plan. All too often, there is a disconnect between the vision of a chief executive and the board, especially when things go wrong.Of course, the other challenge with a company offering a long-term vision is not only meeting its goals, but also changing them if the market or economy change. Mr. Fink said he appreciated that argument, but contended that boards that lay out multiyear plans wont feel locked into them.Given the right context, long-term shareholders will understand, and even expect, that you will need to pivot in response to the changing environments you are navigating, Mr. Fink wrote. But one reason for investors short-term horizons is that companies have not sufficiently educated them about the ecosystems they are operating in.That may be true, but it is admittedly difficult for executives to reverse course without worrying about losing face.Mr. Fink is also pushing for companies to consider environmental, social and governance issues ranging from climate change to diversity to board effectiveness. These issues have long been an afterthought for most companies, and in particular, for investors, who have simply sought companies that deliver the highest returns.These issues offer both risks and opportunities, but for too long, companies have not considered them core to their business  even when the worlds political leaders are increasingly focused on them, as demonstrated by the Paris climate accord, Mr. Fink wrote.Finally, Mr. Fink suggests that business actually needs to take on a greater responsibility in pushing for change in Washington. He says that tax policy needs to be reformed and investment in infrastructure must become a priority. If the government fails to invest in our nations infrastructure, it will not only cost businesses and consumers $1.8 trillion over the next five years, but clearly represents a threat to the ability of companies to grow.He says he believes that corporate America needs help from Washington to shift to a more long-term focus. We recognize that the culture of short-term results is not something that can be solved by C.E.O.s and their boards alone."}
{"text": "One evening in the late fall, Lucien Majors, 84, sat at his kitchen table, his wife Jan by his side, as he described a recent dream.Mr. Majors had end-stage bladder cancer and was in renal failure. As he spoke with a doctor from Hospice Buffalo , he was alert but faltering.In the dream, he said, he was in his car with his great pal, Carmen. His three sons, teenagers, were in the back seat, joking around.Were driving down Clinton Street, said Mr. Majors, his watery, pale blue eyes widening with delight at the thought of the road trip.We were looking for the Grand Canyon. And then they saw it. We talked about how amazing, because there it was  all this time, the Grand Canyon was just at the end of Clinton Street!Mr. Majors had not spoken with Carmen in more than 20 years. His sons are in their late 50s and early 60s.Why do you think your boys were in the car? asked Dr. Christopher W. Kerr, a Hospice Buffalo palliative care physician who researches the therapeutic role of patients end-of-life dreams and visions.My sons are the greatest accomplishment of my life, Mr. Majors said.He died three weeks later.For thousands of years, the dreams and visions of the dying have captivated cultures, which imbued them with sacred import. Anthropologists, theologians and sociologists have studied these so-called deathbed phenomena. They appear in medieval writings and Renaissance paintings, in Shakespearean works and set pieces from 19th-century American and British novels, particularly by Dickens.  One of the most famous moments in film is the mysterious deathbed murmur in Citizen Kane: Rosebud!Even the law reveres a dying persons final words, allowing them to be admitted as evidence in an unusual exception to hearsay rules.In the modern medical world, such experiences have been noted by psychologists, social workers and nurses.  But doctors tend to give them a wide berth because we dont know what the hell they are, said Dr. Timothy E. Quill, an expert on palliative care medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Some researchers have surmised that patients and doctors avoid reporting these phenomena for fear of ridicule.Now a team of clinicians and researchers led by Dr. Kerr at Hospice Buffalo, an internist who has a doctorate in neurobiology, are seeking to demystify these experiences and understand their role and importance in supporting a good death  for the patient and the bereaved.These events are distinct from near-death experiences, such as those recalled by people revived in intensive care units, said Pei C. Grant, the director of the research team. These are people on a journey towards death, not people who just missed it.Hospice Buffalo, in Cheektowaga, N.Y., cares for 5,000 patients a year, mostly with visits to private homes and nursing facilities. After doctors, nurses, social workers or chaplains ask patients, How have you been sleeping? they often follow up with, Can you recall any dreams?I was laying in bed and people were walking very slowly by me. The right-hand side I didnt know, but they were all very friendly and they touched my arm and my hand as they went by. But the other side were people that I knew  my mom and dad were there, my uncle. Everybody I knew that was dead was there. The only thing was, my husband wasnt there, nor was my dog, and I knew that I would be seeing them.  Jeanne Faber, 75, months before her death from ovarian cancer.For their primary study, published in The Journal of Palliative Medicine, the researchers conducted multiple interviews with 59 terminally ill patients admitted to acute care at Hospice Buffalo, a facility furnished in warm woods, with windows that frame views of fountains, gazebos and gardens. Nearly all the patients reported having had dreams or visions. They described the majority of their dreams as comforting. About one in every five was associated with distress, and the remainder felt neutral.The dreams and visions loosely sorted into categories: opportunities to engage with the deceased; loved ones waiting; unfinished business. Themes of love, given or withheld, coursed through the dreams, as did the need for resolution and even forgiveness. In their dreams, patients were reassured that they had been good parents, children and workers. They packed boxes, preparing for journeys, and, like Mr. Majors, often traveled with dear companions as guides. Although many patients said they rarely remembered their dreams, these they could not forget.A 76-year-old patient said he dreamed of his mother, who died when he was a child. He could smell her perfume and hear her soothing voice saying, I love you.An older woman cradled an invisible infant as she lay in bed. (Her husband told researchers it was the couples first child, who had been stillborn.)Nine days before she died, a 54-year-old woman dreamed of a childhood friend who had caused her great pain decades earlier. The friend, who had since died, appeared as an old man and said, Sorry, youre a good person, and If you need help, just call my name.This is certainly research in its infancy. The investigators, counselors and palliative care doctors, are trying to identify and describe the phenomena. Dr. Quill said he believed the studies would help make these experiences more accessible to skeptical doctors.The huge challenge of this work is to help patients feel more normal and less alone during this unusual experience of dying, he said. The more we can articulate that people do have vivid dreams and visions, the more we can be helpful.Other research suggests that dreams seem to express emotions that have been building. Tore Nielsen, a dream neuroscience researcher and director of the Dream and Nightmare Laboratory, at the University of Montreal,  surmised that at the end of life, such a need becomes more insistent. Troubled dreams erupt with excessive energy. But positive dreams can serve a similar purpose.The motivation and pressure for these dreams is coming from a place of fear and uncertainty, he said. The dreamers are literally helping themselves out of a tough spot.In the weeks and days before death, the dreams of the patients in the study tended to occur with greater frequency, populated with the dead rather than the living. The researchers suggest that such phenomena might even have prognostic value.I was an aggressive physician, always asking, Is there more we can do?  said Dr. Kerr, who is also the chief medical officer for Hospice Buffalo. There was a patient who I thought needed to be rehydrated, and we could buy him some time. But, he said, a nurse, familiar with the patients dreams, cautioned: You dont get it. He is seeing his dead mother. He died two days later.Certainly, many dying patients cannot communicate. Or they recount typical dream detritus: a dwarf lifting the refrigerator, neighbors bringing a chicken and a monkey into the patients apartment. And some patients, to their disappointment, do not remember their dreams.Dr. Kerr, who recently gave a talk at TEDxBuffalo about the research, said he was simply advocating that health care providers ask patients open-ended questions about dreams, without fear of recrimination from family and colleagues.Often when we sedate them, we are sterilizing them from their own dying process, he said. I have done it, and it feels horrible. Theyll say, You robbed me  I was with my wife.While the patient was lying in bed, her mother by her side, she had a vision: She saw her mothers best friend, Mary, who died of leukemia years ago, in her mothers bedroom, playing with the curtains. Marys hair was long again. I had a feeling she was coming to say, Youre going to be O.K. I felt relief and happiness and I wasnt afraid of it at all.   Jessica Stone, 13, who had Ewings sarcoma, a type of bone cancer, a few months before she died.Many in hospice suffer from delirium, which can affect up to 85 percent of hospitalized patients at the end of life. In a delirious state, brought on by fever, brain metastases or end-stage changes in body chemistry, circadian rhythms are severely disordered, so the patient may not know whether he is awake or dreaming. Cognition is altered.Those who care for the terminally ill are inclined to see end-of-life dreams as manifestations of delirium. But the Hospice Buffalo researchers say that while some study patients slipped in and out of delirium, their end-of-life dreams were not, by definition, the product of such a state. Delirious patients generally cannot engage with others or give a coherent, organized narrative. The hallucinations they are able to describe may be traumatizing, not comforting.Yet the question remains of what to make of these patients claims of dreaming while awake, or having visions  and the not-uncommon phenomena of seeing deceased relatives or friends hovering on the ceiling or in corners.Donna Brennan, a longtime nurse with Hospice Buffalo, recalled chatting on the couch with a 92-year-old patient with congestive heart failure. Suddenly, the patient looked over at the door and called out, Just a minute, Im speaking with the nurse.Told that no one was there, the patient smiled, saying it was Aunt Janiece (her dead sister) and patted a couch cushion, showing the visitor where to sit. Then the patient cheerfully turned back to Mrs. Brennan and finished her conversation.In her notes, Mrs. Brennan described the episode as a hallucination, a red flag for delirium. When the episode was recounted to Dr. Kerr and Anne Banas, a Hospice Buffalo neurologist and palliative care physician, they preferred the term vision.Is there meaning to the vision or is it disorganized? Dr. Banas asked. If there is meaning, does that need to be explored? Does it bring comfort or is it distressing? We have a responsibility to ask that next question. It can be cathartic, and patients often need to share. And if we dont ask, look what we may miss.Dr. William Breitbart, chairman of the psychiatry department at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who has written about delirium and palliative care, said that a teams response must also consider bedside caregivers: These dreams or visions can be interpreted by family members as comforting, linking them to the legacy of their ancestry.But if people dont believe that, they can be distressed. My mother is hallucinating and seeing dead people. Do something about it! Dr. Breitbart trains staff to respect the families beliefs and help them understand the complexities of delirium.Some dream episodes occur during what is known as mixed-state sleep  when the boundaries between wakefulness and sleep become fragmented, said Dr. Carlos H. Schenck, a psychiatrist and sleep expert at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Jessica Stone, the teenager with Ewings sarcoma, spoke movingly about a dream of her dead dog, Shadow. When she awoke, she said, she saw his long, dark shape alongside her bed.Dr. Banas, the neurologist, favors the phrase end-of-life experiences. I try to normalize it for the family, because how they perceive it can push them away from that bedside or bring them closer, she said.The patient had never really talked about the war. But in his final dreams, the stories emerged. In the first, the bloody dying were everywhere. On Omaha Beach, at Normandy. In the waves. He was a 17-year-old gunner on a rescue boat, trying frantically to bring them back to the U.S.S. Texas. There is nothing but death and dead soldiers all around me, he said. In another, a dead soldier told him, They are going to come get you next week. Finally, he dreamed of getting his discharge papers, which he described as comforting. He died in his sleep two days later.   John, 88, who had lymphoma.Not all end-of-life dreams soothe the dying. Researchers found that about 20 percent were upsetting. Often, those who had suffered trauma might revisit it in their dying dreams. Some can resolve those experiences. Some cannot.When should doctors intervene with antipsychotic or anti-anxiety medication, to best allow the patient a peaceful death? For the Hospice Buffalo physicians, the decision is made with a team assessment that includes input from family members.Dr. Kerr said: Children will see their parents in an altered state and think theyre suffering and fighting their dying. But if you say: Shes talking about dead people, and thats normal. Ill bet you can learn a lot about her and your family, you may see the relative calming down and taking notes.Without receiving sufficient information from the family, a team may not know how to read the patients agitation. One patient seemed tormented by nightmares. The Hospice Buffalo team interviewed family members, who reluctantly disclosed that the woman had been sexually abused as a girl. The family was horrified that she was reliving these memories in her dying days.Armed with this information, the team chose to administer anti-anxiety medication, rather than just antipsychotics. The woman relaxed and was able to have a powerful exchange with a priest. She died during a quiet sleep, several days later.This fall, Mrs. Brennan, the nurse, would check in on a patient with end-stage lung cancer who was a former police officer. He told her that he had done bad stuff on the job. He said he had cheated on his wife and was estranged from his children. His dreams are never peaceful, Mrs. Brennan said. He gets stabbed, shot or cant breathe. He apologizes to his wife, and she isnt responding, or she reminds him that he broke her heart. Hes a tortured soul.Some palliative care providers maintain that such dreams are the core of a spiritual experience and should not be tampered with. Dr. Quill, who calls people with such views hospice romantics, disagreed.We should be opening the door with our questions, but not forcing patients through it, Dr. Quill said. Our job is witnessing, exploring and lessening their loneliness. If its benign and rich with content, let it go. But if it brings up serious old wounds, get real help  a psychologist, a chaplain  because in this area, we physicians dont know what were doing. In the first dream, a black spider with small eyes came close to her face. Then it turned into a large black truck with a red flatbed, bearing down on her. Terrified, she forced herself awake. In another dream, she had to pass through her laundry room to get to the kitchen. She glanced down and saw about 50 black spiders crawling on the floor. She was so scared! But when she looked closer, she saw they were ladybugs. She felt so happy! Ladybugs are nice and I knew they werent going to hurt me, she recounted later. So I made my way to the kitchen. Rosemary Shaffer, 78, two months before she died of colon cancer.The Hospice Buffalo researchers have found that these dreams offer comfort not only for the dying, but for their mourners.Kathleen Hutton holds fast to the end-of-life dream journals fastidiously kept by her sister, Mrs. Shaffer, a former elementary schoolteacher and principal. Rosemary Shaffer wrote about spiders and trucks, and then the ladybugs. In one dream, she  saw flowers at a funeral home, which reminded her of those her daughter painted on handmade scarves. She felt loved and joyful.I was glad she could talk about dreams with the hospice people, Ms. Hutton said. She knew it was her subconscious working through what she was feeling. She was much more at peace.Knowing that has made her own grief more manageable, said Ms. Hutton, who teared up as she clasped the journals during a visit at the hospices family lounge.Several months ago, Mrs. Brennan, the nurse, sat with a distraught husband, whose wife had pancreatic cancer that had spread to the liver. She had been reporting dreams about work, God and familiar people who had died. The patient thought that she would be welcomed in heaven, she said. That God told her she had been a good wife and mother.Her husband was angry at God, Mrs. Brennan said. I said: But Ann is not. Her dreams arent scary to her at all. They are all about validation.He just put his head down and wept."}
{"text": "Howard Koslow, a painter and illustrator who for more than four decades designed many of the most recognizable stamps issued by the United States Postal Service, including a 1994 series depicting famous blues and jazz musicians and 30 stamps depicting coastal lighthouses, died on Jan. 25 at his home in Toms River, N.J. He was 91.The death was confirmed by his daughter Amy-Jo Willig.Mr. Koslow had established a busy practice as a commercial artist, doing corporate reports, book covers and advertising illustrations, when, in the early 1970s, a fellow artist suggested that he try his hand at postage stamps.In 1971 he secured the commission to design an eight-cent stamp commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, an agreement among 12 nations to ensure that their research in the Antarctic should be freely shared and nonmilitary. Against a blue background, Mr. Koslow superimposed the official emblem used on treaty documents on a white map of Antarctica.The following year, for a series honoring the national parks, Mr. Koslow designed a six-cent stamp that depicted an evening concert at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Va.Over his long career he designed more than 50 stamps and postal cards, on subjects including the signing of the Constitution, Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Bridge, Ellis Island and, as part of the Legends of American Music series, eight blues and jazz masters: Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith, Muddy Waters, Ma Rainey, Jimmy Rushing, Howlin Wolf, Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey.He was a well-known designer, and very prolific, but it is not so much the number of stamps as the time span of more than 40 years, which is very unusual, said Daniel A. Piazza, the chief curator of philately at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum. The lighthouse stamps went on for nearly 25 years. The first series, in 1990, was supposed to be a one-off, but the stamps were so popular that he ended up doing five more series.Each subsequent series celebrated a different region: the Great Lakes, the Southeast, the Pacific and the Gulf. The final series, devoted to the lighthouses of New England, was issued in 2013.Howard Bertram Koslow was born on Sept. 21, 1924, in Brooklyn, where he grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood. His father, Benjamin, was an electrician, and his mother, the former Ruth Sachs, was a housewife.After graduating from James Madison High School, he studied advertising design at Pratt Institute and served an apprenticeship at the Manhattan studio of the French poster designer Jean Carlu. He spent a summer at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and studied graphics at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.His early stamps, produced by engraving, were executed in a linear style with a limited color palette. Later, using offset lithography, he was able to expand his color range and adopt a more naturalistic style, often working from photographs. While painting his designs, he looked through a reducing glass to see how his work would look when shrunk to about a sixth its actual size.There is a real skill to making something readable at one inch square, Mr. Piazza said. Howard was very good at that.In addition to his postal work, Mr. Koslow achieved a substantial reputation as a historical painter for the Air Force and NASA. Many of the works he executed while traveling for the Air Forces Historical Art Program are exhibited at the Air Force Academy and the Pentagon.In 1989, the Coast Guard commissioned a painting from him for its bicentennial. His painting, The Cutter Harriet Lane Fires Across the Bow of Nashville, depicted the first naval engagement of the Civil War, on Apr. 13, 1861, at the entrance to Charleston Harbor.For NASA, Mr. Koslow did the official paintings of the Apollo 15 mission and the first launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. His NASA paintings can be seen at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington and the NASA Art Gallery at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla.In addition to his daughter Ms. Willig, Mr. Koslow is survived by his wife, the former Helen Feldman; another daughter, Kathi Meyer; a sister, Helene Mandelbaum; and four grandchildren.Even in the normally placid world of stamps, Mr. Koslow sometimes encountered controversy. In designing a 33-cent stamp in 1999 honoring the artist Jackson Pollock, Mr. Koslow worked from a well-known Life magazine photograph, by Martha Holmes, that showed the artist at work in his studio, a cigarette dangling from his lips.Mr. Koslow removed the cigarette in accordance with Postal Service policy, which forbade any image that could be seen as promoting tobacco use.Not everyone appreciated the alteration. The president of the National Smokers Alliance wrote, in a letter to the Postmaster General, that the revision was an affront to the more than 50 million Americans who choose to smoke."}
{"text": "Robert Ashley is no longer with us, but his voice  calm, mellow, reassuring, quizzical, amused, earnest  lives on. Surrounded by a shifting, unstable electronic haze, it is the only thing you hear at the Kitchen during Quicksand, the opera that he wrote in the final years before his death, at 83, in 2014.It will not surprise those familiar with his idiosyncratic, enigmatic works  assemblages of deadpan observations and stories, not quite sung and yet something more than spoken  that Quicksand is a spy tale that keeps slipping beyond its genre, into ruminations on love, the Pittsburgh Steelers, country music, Jane Austen. The audience listens to a recording of Mr. Ashleys recitation of the text while watching the modest yet enrapturing, ever-changing staging. Consisting of just two dancers, a large patchwork fabric and a set of windows, it has been directed and designed by the choreographic innovator Steve Paxton, with restless lighting by David Moodey.While the spectacle is stylized, Quicksand is more plot-driven than much of Mr. Ashleys output: He wrote the libretto, which was published in book form in 2011, in an attempt to evoke the mystery-thriller novels he adored. This being Mr. Ashley, the novel is something closer to prose poetry, quotidian in its language but lyrical, pensive and melancholy in its feel.The central character, who moonlights as a low-level courier for American intelligence, has ended up in an unnamed Southeast Asian country where he gets entangled in an effort to overthrow the authoritarian government. Dramatic stuff: That the operas mood remains so low-key, even slouchy, is a testament to Mr. Ashleys (and Mr. Paxtons) determinedly casual, if always exact, style.Mr. Ashley writes in a note at the start of the novel that everything in the book is true, except for a lot of the facts. One true fact is that the protagonist is an aging opera composer. Someone asks him what his operas are about. This is hard, the narrator answers. I say they are about people telling stories.It shouldnt be necessary at this point to defend the categorization of Ashleys works as operas, but they remain so outside the norm that it feels important to state, for the record, that Quicksand is, indisputably, opera. Why? Because of its stylization, its emotional extremity; because the aural element heightens the visual, and vice versa; because it is a thrilling investigation of what can be musical in the human voice, even when speaking.The legato of a simple sentence  Why did I do this  followed by its repetition, staccato this time: Why. Did. I. Do. This. A slight elongation of the vowel in the final word of the phrase some foreign place, unmistakably estranging. As in any opera, these vocal effects and so many others are precisely lodged in, and emerge from, the music  here a vibrating, volatile drone, executed by Ashleys longtime collaborator, Tom Hamilton.Though full of wit, Quicksand has many poignant reminders that the voice coming from the speakers for three hours belongs to someone departed. Im getting out, the narrator says at one point, pledging to leave the spy game  which is no country for old men  while implying much more than that. Constant references to carry-on luggage start feeling more and more like invocations of carrion.Suffused with death, the pieces emotions build slowly but surely: Mr. Ashleys art, as ever, eventually does take on both the comforting predictability and quirky surprise of a mystery novel. Or of life. Something is going to happen, as the narrator says. The question is, what?"}

{"text": "LIMA, Per  En los 80, Hugo Bustos trabajaba como fotoperiodista en Ayacucho, una provincia peruana que entonces se rega por ley marcial. En esa poca el ejrcito libraba una campaa brutal de contrainsurgencia para abatir a Sendero Luminoso. El trabajo de Bustos como reportero lo convirti en un testigo incmodo de las atrocidades cometidas por ambos bandos, y recibi numerosas amenazas de muerte.En 1988 Bustos fue emboscado a plena luz del da por una patrulla militar. Lo mataron a tiros y su cuerpo fue destruido con una granada para intimidar a los dems.Ms de 50 periodistas han sido asesinados en Per desde que el pas recuper la democracia en 1980; muy pocos casos han sido llevados ante la justicia. Sin embargo, el asesinato de Hugo Bustos no fue olvidado. El caso fue tomado primero por el Comit para la Proteccin de los Periodistas de Nueva York y posteriormente por la Comisin Interamericana de Derechos Humanos.Los avances en la investigacin estaban paralizados pero, finalmente, ms de un cuarto de siglo despus de su muerte, se est llevando a cabo un juicio. Y eso no es lo ms extraordinario: el acusado en el juicio podra ser el prximo presidente de Per.El General Daniel Urresti, conocido en la poca del asesinato de Bustos con el pseudnimo de Capitn Arturo, fue jefe de inteligencia en la base del ejrcito en Huanta, Ayacucho. Urresti fue acusado el ao pasado de haber ordenado el asesinato del periodista. De ser declarado culpable, enfrenta una sentencia de 25 aos en prisin.Al mismo tiempo, el General Urresti ha sido elegido para ser el candidato presidencial del partido gobernante del pas, el Partido Nacionalista del Per, en las elecciones generales programadas para el 10 de abril.Por si eso no fuera lo suficientemente extrao, la compaera de frmula del General Urresti es Susana Villarn, una reconocida activista de derechos humanos. Entre 2002 y 2005, fue integrante de la Comisin Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, la misma organizacin que ayud a llevar el caso de Urresti ante la justicia.Estos compaeros tan dispares son menos extraordinarios de lo que se podra pensar: los partidos son dbiles en Per y los polticos no reparan en cambiar de bando. Pero incluso para estndares peruanos, la candidatura de Villarn es descaradamente oportunista. La viuda de Bustos, Margarita Patio, ha acusado a Villarn de una traicin que insulta, veja e indigna a los familiares de vctimas de graves violaciones a los derechos humanos.Conoc bien a Hugo Bustos. Trabajamos juntos a mediados de los 80 en Huanta.Poco despus de que mi colega fuera asesinado, me nombraron directora ejecutiva del Comit para la Proteccin de los Periodistas en Nueva York, y en 1990, junto con Human Rights Watch y el Center for Justice and International Law, hicimos que el caso de Bustos fuera remitido a la Comisin Interamericana de Derechos Humanos. En 1997 la comisin exigi al gobierno peruano dar inicio a una investigacin imparcial para que los responsables fueran sometidos a juicio.El caso sigui estancado porque el gobierno del Presidente Alberto Fujimori haba promulgado una ley de amnista que le otorgaba inmunidad al personal militar implicado en abusos de derechos humanos durante el estado de emergencia. No fue sino hasta 2001, cuando se nombr una comisin de la verdad, que el gobierno peruano por fin acept investigar 165 casos, incluyendo el asesinato de Bustos. En 2007 un tribunal sentenci a dos funcionarios por el delito, pero en 2009 uno de los dos sentenciados implic al General Urresti en el asesinato.El General Urresti niega la acusacin e insiste que el caso tiene motivos polticos, ya que intenta bloquear sus ambiciones presidenciales. Por su parte, Villarn declar que, a pesar de haber tenido dudas en el pasado, est convencida de la inocencia de su compaero de frmula.La primera vez que vi al general en persona fue en diciembre pasado, cuando testifiqu en su juicio, pero ha sido una figura controvertida en Per desde hace algn tiempo. En 2014 fue nombrado ministro del interior por el Presidente Ollanta Humala quien fue oficial del ejrcito durante la guerra sucia a pesar de que Urresti ya tena una investigacin abierta por el asesinato de Bustos. Solo dur ocho meses en ese puesto, ya que tras recibir crticas por brutalidad policial durante las protestas del ao pasado fue obligado a renunciar. Sin embargo, el estilo combativo del General Urresti en sus apariciones televisivas lo han convertido en una figura popular.Por una coincidencia perversa, se espera que el tribunal dicte sentencia en el caso Urresti al mismo tiempo que los peruanos voten en la primera vuelta en abril. Y es as como los electores tienen no solo un candidato presidencial que alterna apariciones en televisin con comparecencias ante los tribunales, sino adems estn expuestos a la posibilidad de que un presidente electo gobierne desde prisin.No tiene muchas probabilidades de ganar, pero ese podra no ser el principal objetivo de su candidatura. Al ungir al General Urresti como su sucesor poltico, Humala pareci exculpar a un presunto responsable sujeto a una grave acusacin. Los jueces de Per no son conocidos por su independencia ni integridad; el respaldo presidencial puede sin duda ser visto como un intento de interferir en el curso de la justicia, y en efecto podra comprometer la imparcialidad del juicio.El esfuerzo por instalar a un aliado tan polmico en la presidencia puede ser un quid pro quo del presidente saliente. La primera dama, Nadine Heredia, est sometida a una investigacin por presunto lavado de fondos de campaa y transferir millones de dlares a cuentas bancarias secretas en el extranjero (EL presidente tiene inmunidad que solo puede ser levantada por voto mayoritario en el Congreso una vez que deje el cargo). Humala dejar la presidencia con ndices de aprobacin terriblemente bajos; su patrocinio a la candidatura de Urresti podra ser visto como un ltimo intento desesperado por apuntalar su situacin poltica.No hace falta decir que aquellos que aspiran a un cargo pblico deberan estar libres de toda sospecha de conductas delictivas. Evidentemente este no es el caso de Urresti. Su candidatura socava la ya frgil democracia peruana.Y lo que resulta peor: la candidatura del General Urresti interfiere groseramente con la administracin de justicia. Esto subvierte la larga batalla del Per por confrontar su oscuro pasado de crmenes contra la humanidad."}
{"text": "DES MOINES  Senator Ted Cruz won support among evangelicals, very conservative voters and those who were seeking a candidate who shares their values. Donald J. Trump did well among first-time caucusgoers and those who want the next president to be from outside the political establishment. Senator Marco Rubio found support among voters who said the economy was the most important issue and those who thought it was most important to have a candidate who could win in November.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton prevailed among women, older voters, political moderates and caucusgoers who prioritized having a candidate who can win in November.Senator Bernie Sanders won the overwhelming support of younger voters, first-time caucusgoers and those who said what mattered most was having a candidate who is honest and trustworthy.Those were among the more striking findings from polls of voters entering the caucuses across Iowa on Monday.After months of campaigning, fierce debates and a blizzard of television commercials, the polls, conducted by Edison Research, showed how voters split among the presidential hopefuls when it finally came time to make a decision.On the Republican side, 4 in 10 caucusgoers described themselves as very conservative, and they supported Mr. Cruz over Mr. Trump by a more than two-to-one ratio. Nearly two-thirds described themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians, and they favored Mr. Cruz as well.A plurality of Republican caucus voters, about 4 in 10, said a candidate sharing their values was the quality that mattered most in deciding whom to support. Of those voters, the breakdown was stark: 38 percent sided with Mr. Cruz, 21 percent supported Mr. Rubio and only 5 percent went with Mr. Trump.Alternatively, for the 14 percent of voters who said it mattered to have a candidate who tells it like it is, two-thirds of them sided with Mr. Trump.A billionaire real estate mogul, Mr. Trump satisfied the thirst of many voters for an outsider candidate. About half of voters said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment, and of those voters, nearly half supported Mr. Trump.Just over 1 in 10 voters named immigration as their most important issue, but Mr. Trump did well with those voters.Mr. Rubio saw strength among college graduates, who favored him over the other candidates. About 1 in 5 voters said a candidates ability to win in November was the quality that mattered most, and they backed Mr. Rubio, who has emphasized his electability in November.More than one-third of Republican caucusgoers said they decided whom to support more than a month ago, and they heavily backed Mr. Trump. The same number made up their minds in the last few days, and they broke for Mr. Rubio.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state in President Obamas administration, has presented herself as the best person to build on his agenda. The majority of Democratic caucus voters said the next president should generally continue President Obamas policies, rather than change to more or less liberal policies.Those voters who want to continue Mr. Obamas policies favor Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders by a large margin.Mr. Sanders, for his part, received strong support from first-time caucusgoers, who accounted for more than 4 in 10 voters.But first-time caucus voters made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate than they did in 2008, when Mr. Obama, then a senator from Illinois, claimed victory, and Mrs. Clinton finished third. That year, 57 percent of Democratic caucusgoers were first-timers.Mr. Sanders was backed by very liberal voters, and he was also widely supported by younger voters. But voters age 65 and older accounted for nearly 3 in 10 Democratic caucusgoers on Monday, up from 22 percent in 2008.Democratic caucusgoers split on the issue they think is the most important facing the country. Three in 10 said health care, while one-third said the economy. Both of these groups went for Mrs. Clinton. Just over one in four voters viewed income inequality as the most important issue facing the country. They went strongly for Mr. Sanders, whose campaign has revolved in large part around that issue.Nearly 3 in 10 voters said the quality that mattered most to them was having a candidate with the right experience, and they favored Mrs. Clinton by an enormous margin: Nearly 9 in 10 sided with her.Two in 10 voters said it was most important that the candidate can win in November, and more than three-quarters sided with Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders fared best on honesty and trustworthiness. For voters to whom that mattered more than other qualities, Mr. Sanders won the support of more than 8 in 10, while Mrs. Clinton was backed by only 1 in 10.And for voters who said that caring about people like them was the quality that mattered most, about three-quarters sided with Mr. Sanders."}

Gas surpassed coal as the leading source of power in the United States for a fifth month in a row in November, according to the latest data available from the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency. The first time gas overtook coal was April 2015. With just data for the month of December missing from 2015, some analysts think power companies may have burned more gas than coal for the full year for the first time. Coal has been the primary source of fuel for American power plants for at least a century, but its use has been declining since peaking in 2007 and is expected to decline further as the federal government imposes rules to limit carbon emissions."}
{"text": "Leer en Espaol.The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, have been at war against the Colombian state for five decades, one of the words longest-running insurgencies. The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions, cost the state many billions of dollars, fractured the nation and destabilized the entire region.But negotiations that began in Havana in 2012 have now brought the possibility of peace into sharper focus than ever. The sides have reached tentative agreements on a range of key issues and set a March 23 deadline for a final deal.Since the talks began, Federico Rios, 35, a Colombian photographer who lives in Medelln, has made several trips into the Colombian hinterlands to spend time with the rebels and photograph them. His aim, he said, was to demystify them and capture the humanity of the groups fighters during what may well be the insurgencys final days before they lay down their arms.It seems to me to be important, at the moment of the signatures, in this moment of transition for the guerrillas, that Colombians know who the FARC are, he said.While presidential administrations sought for years to cast the guerrillas as murderers and drug traffickers driven by bloodlust and greed, the rebels have portrayed themselves as the protectors of the people, the conscience and caretakers of lands and communities that have historically been neglected by the countrys oligarchs.They have done terrible things like kill people, use unconventional weapons, kidnapped, extorted, divided families, Mr. Rios said in a telephone interview. At the same time, he said, the insurgents have also helped parts of the country that were forsaken by the government  remote areas that are home to poor farmers without rights  by providing teachers, schools, medical services and public works.Last November, for his most recent photos, he flew to a remote area of Choc Province in Colombias northwest, followed by three separate boat rides that carried him deeper into the forest. After a long hike, he finally arrived at a makeshift FARC camp. He spent the next week living and photographing among the insurgencys 57th Front.The guerrillas did not stay in one place for long, moving camps every couple of days and carrying their belongings on their backs.Mr. Rios captured the daily rhythms of this life: rebels setting up their bunks fashioned from wood and camouflage tarps, standing guard on the perimeter of their camps, cooking, bathing in a river, trudging through dense forest.In these photos, the rebels expressions are weary and sullen. There is no merriment. Like armed forces everywhere, so much of their work, it seems, is routine and tedious. The only suggestion of recreation is a photograph of a rebel, an AK-47 slung over has back, setting up a shot in a village pool hall. But even that effort seems devoid of fun, a barely successful hedge against boredom.Its not like they are a bunch of G.I. Joes armed and firing away all the time, Mr. Rios said.During that week, he also accompanied FARC to a meeting with members of two rural communities in territory controlled by the rebels. The campesinos were concerned that should FARC put down its weapons and demobilize, the communities would be vulnerable to attack by paramilitary forces seeking to settle scores.They were saying, Dont demobilize, dont have the peace talks, so that you can continue to defend us, Mr. Rios recalled.Mr. Rios also heard uncertainty within the ranks of FARC itself. Theres a happiness for the peace talks and for the advances that the negotiations have made, he said. At the same time, I think theres some doubt about whats going to happen in their lives after the negotiations.How would the demobilization process work? Would the rebels and their families be safe from the retributive violence in an ensuing dirty war? How would they reintegrate into society? Would there truly be room for them in political society?These are the last days before starting a completely different process, Mr. Rios said. This is going to be a big change for them.Follow @federicorios, @KirkSemple and @nytimesphoto on Twitter. You can also find us on Facebook and Instagram."}

I was about to take him out, and then he made every play down the stretch.Drummond fell just shy of an N.B.A.-high sixth 20-point, 20-rebound game of the season but delivered the tiebreaking basket on a dunk with 1 minute 30 seconds remaining on a pass from Jackson. Jackson added a couple of clutch jumpers as the Pistons avoided a third straight loss.The Pistons were coming off losses to Cleveland and Toronto, the top two teams in the Eastern Conference, but were just good enough to get by the Nets, one of the worst.Nets center Brook Lopez scored 27 points. Andrea Bargnani added 18 off the bench for the Nets, who had lost of four in a row and were outscored 28-7 on second-chance points. That was the game, the Nets interim coach Tony Brown said.

Atlanta entered the game having lost five of six to drop to fifth place in the East.Deron Williams, coming off a 27-point performance in Dallass home win Sunday over Phoenix, left the game early in the second quarter with a bruised hip.Chandler Parsons had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 points for the Mavericks.SUNS FIRE COACH The Phoenix Suns, mired in one of the worst stretches in their history, fired Jeff Hornacek as coach and promoted Earl Watson to interim coach.Watson was selected after interviews were conducted with all three Suns assistants.Watson, 36, was an N.B.A. point guard for 13 seasons and was in his first season as a Suns assistant after a year as an assistant coach of the Austin Spurs of the N.B.A. Development League.He retired as a player in 2014 after appearing in 878 games for Portland, Seattle/Oklahoma City, Memphis, Denver, Indiana and Utah."}
{"text": "DES MOINES  Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were locked in an intensely tight race in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday as Mrs. Clintons strong support among women and older voters was matched by the passionate liberal foot soldiers whom Mr. Sanders has been calling to political revolution.The close results were deeply unnerving to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as her advisers, some of whom had expressed growing confidence in recent days that they had recaptured political momentum after weeks when Mr. Sanders was drawing huge crowds and rising in the polls. The Clintons had appeared optimistic at rallies over the weekend, thanking Iowans for their support as much as urging them to turn out to vote.The close vote means that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are likely to split Iowas share of delegates to the Democratic convention, and Mr. Sanders will be able to argue that the Iowa result was a virtual tie.The Clinton team was counting on its huge, well-trained army of volunteers, covering all of Iowas 1,681 voting precincts, to counter the enormous enthusiasm of voters who jammed into events to hear Mr. Sanders. But his well-financed Iowa organization was able to convert the energy of his crowds into voters on Monday night, as he drew huge numbers of first-time caucusgoers, young people and liberals who responded to his rallying cry against the nations rigged economy.The virtual tie between the two candidates instantly raised the stakes for their next face-off, the primary next Tuesday in New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders holds a solid lead in polls there and has the advantage of being from Vermont; candidates from neighboring states have won the states primary in recent decades, and Mr. Sanders is admired in the state.Clinton advisers said late Monday night that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton were discussing bringing on additional staff members to strengthen her campaign operation now that a pitched battle may lie ahead against Mr. Sanders. The advisers said they did not know if a significant staff shakeup was at hand, but they said that the Clintons were disappointed with Monday nights result and wanted to ensure that her organization, political messaging and communications strategy were in better shape for the contests to come.At her caucus night party here, Mrs. Clinton sought to put the best face on a tight result that had nearly half of Democrats voting against her. As I stand here tonight breathing a big sigh of relief  thank you, Iowa! she said, joined on stage by Mr. Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America, Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders, who spoke shortly after she finished, laughed as his crowd chanted feel the Bern, his campaigns unofficial slogan. Thank you  Iowa, thank you! Mr. Sanders said.Noting that he began his Iowa campaign with no name recognition and no money, Mr. Sanders drew ecstatic cheers as he said he took on the Clintons  the most powerful political organization in the United States of America  and drove them into a tie.I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment, Mr. Sanders said. That is, given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.The results suggested that Mr. Sanders would be a strong opponent of Mrs. Clintons for a long time. The voters sent a clear message that income inequality weighed on their minds, with more than one in four Democratic voters saying the issue was the most important facing the nation, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls.Mr. Sanderss strong performance in Iowa was a significant milestone in a campaign in which he began 40 percentage points behind Mrs. Clinton when they both declared their candidacies last spring. Many Democrats privately dismissed Mr. Sanders as a left-wing fringe candidate who had no real chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton anywhere other than his home state of Vermont, where his democratic socialist politics were not as exotic as many Democratic Party leaders found them.But Mr. Sanders proved to be a rigorously disciplined candidate, delivering the same powerful message inveighing against establishment politics, Wall Street and the benefits enjoyed by the wealthy and the well-connected.The Clintons are now hoping for a surprise performance in New Hampshire, where they have campaigned and connected with voters since 1992, when Mr. Clinton came in a strong second place in the states primary, and Mrs. Clinton won the 2008 primary over Barack Obama, then a senator who had earlier won the Iowa caucuses.Steve Duprey, a Republican national committeeman from New Hampshire, said if Mrs. Clinton ekes out a clear victory in Iowa, however small, it would give her some much-needed momentum in New Hampshire  and if she can build that into a New Hampshire win, I think it will start the death rattle of the Sanders campaign.George Maglaras, a Clinton supporter who is a commissioner of Strafford County, N.H., predicted that Mrs. Clinton would have a lock on the Democratic nomination if she won New Hampshire on top of a close race in Iowa.Any other combination means we are in for a longer nomination process than many had anticipated early on, Mr. Maglaras, a former mayor of Dover, N.H., added. Referring to New Hampshire residents, he said, If they vote with their heads it will be Clinton. If they vote with their hearts it will be Sanders.After losing the Iowa caucuses in 2008 to Mr. Obama, another insurgent candidate who she led in the polls for months, Mrs. Clinton vowed to campaign differently here this time around, holding small events with handpicked voters to learn about the lives and issues for voters here  and to be shown doing so, humbly and thoughtfully, in Iowa television newscasts. While she long said that Iowa would be a tight race, and improved upon her 2008 performance when she won 29.5 percent and fell to third place behind John Edwards, Mrs. Clinton nonetheless hoped that she would start exorcising the ghosts of 2008 with a victory here, and she campaigned hard for it.Mrs. Clinton, 68, performed well on Monday night among women, moderates and older Iowans who rallied behind her promises to build on President Obamas policies and fight for the needs of families. Her shifts to the left on trade, the environment and gay marriage helped her win over Democrats, though not the many liberals and young people who mistrusted her pragmatic style of politics and her ties to wealthy interests and Wall Street.Mr. Sanders, 74, drew strong support from first-time Democratic caucusgoers, who accounted for more than four in 10 voters, according to polls conducted by Edison Research of voters as they entered caucus locations throughout the state Monday evening. But these voters made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate on Monday than they did in 2008, when 57 percent of Democratic caucusgoers were first-timers. Mr. Sanders was also widely supported by younger voters and independents, but voters 65 and older accounted for about three in 10 Democratic voters and they strongly favored Mrs. Clinton.As the results trickled in, the third candidate in the Democratic contest, former Gov. Martin OMalley of Maryland, announced that he was pulling out of the race.With Iowa accounting for only 1 percent of the delegates at stake in the Democratic nomination race, Mrs. Clinton is already far ahead of Mr. Sanders in the delegate count that matters most, given her support from several hundred superdelegates who count toward the nomination. The Clinton campaign has expressed confidence to allies that she can afford to lose Iowa, as well as the New Hampshire primary because of her strength in big-state, delegate-rich primaries and in the South .Both candidates planned to fly to New Hampshire overnight and planned to resume campaigning there on Tuesday.Mr. Sanders developed a better-financed operation here than the Clinton team expected, thanks to robust online fund-raising that netted $20 million in January alone, compared with $37 million for Mrs. Clinton in the last three months of 2015. (The Clinton campaign on Monday declined requests for its January fund-raising number.)Sanders advisers say he now has both money  $28.3 million on hand, compared with $38 million for Mrs. Clinton  and the political momentum to compete vigorously not just in New Hampshire but in upcoming primaries in South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Georgia and caucuses in Nevada, Minnesota, and elsewhere."}

{"text": "The debate over widening inequality, and what to do about it, has gradually moved toward the center of the political agenda and fueled populist movements on the left and the right in many nations.But in the United States  where a competitive political campaign requires huge sums of money, and wealth or access to it is increasingly a prerequisite for entry  the debate has become supercharged.Voters in both parties find themselves wondering whether anyone is looking out for the little guy, even as a candidate like Donald J. Trump suggests that it is precisely his wealth that liberates him from the influence of special interests.So it is fair to ask whether a politicians personal bankroll should be taken into account by voters as a predictor of how he or she might lead. A growing body of research has addressed the extent to which wealth, behavior and policy are linked.Although there are always exceptions, the research generally confirms what many voters perhaps always intuited: that rich political leaders are not like poor political leaders but with more money; rather, wealth changes people qualitatively.Wealth plays out in the political sphere in all kinds of ways, often personally. Can Hillary Clinton represent the interests of working people when she and her husband have taken so much money from Wall Street? Was Mitt Romneys private-equity business too ruthless with workers?But the bigger question is whether money predicts where leaders will come down on policy.The study perhaps most relevant to the relationship between wealth and political behavior is one that looked at whether the wealth of members of Congress predicted their support for legislation affecting inequality.As it is, the typical lawmaker is dozens of times richer than the typical American. But even within Congress, the researchers Michael W. Kraus and Bennett Callaghan found, relative wealth matters  if youre a Democrat.Republicans across the board support policies such as lowering taxes on the rich or reducing business regulation, the authors of the study found. But among Democrats, wealthy lawmakers were more likely to think like Republicans in this regard, while poorer lawmakers were more likely to support such policies as raising the minimum wage or forgiving student debt.Beyond politics and policy, the research also suggests that wealth makes the rich feel, reason, choose and perceive differently from the less privileged.One study examined peoples propensity to break rules  in this case, driving rules. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Toronto examined what kind of drivers violated laws at intersections in California.They found that drivers of luxury vehicles cut off other drivers about 30 percent of the time and cut off pedestrians roughly 45 percent of the time  compared with about 8 percent and 0 percent for drivers of the humblest vehicles.Their conclusion: The common assumption that resource scarcity fuels most unethical behavior may need updating; the freedom and self-orientation conferred by high status may be far more combustible.Other studies have shown that wealth makes it harder for people to read other peoples emotional cues and to be affected by their pain.One study examining mock job interviews  led by Dr. Kraus at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign  found that poorer people were more accurate in judging the specific emotions (e.g., contempt, sympathy) of their partner relative to upper-class participants.In a related study cited by Dr. Kraus, students from upper- and lower-class families were shown a video of distress and suffering, and a neutral control video.The sad video reduced the heart rate of the poorer students  a response associated with fellow feeling  while the heartbeats of the richer students remained consistent.Of course, in the life of any politician, personal wealth is just one factor among many. Perhaps religion offers an apt analogy. Many candidates will tell you their faith shapes how they see the world and how they choose to act  though none will say it is all controlling. Perhaps wealth should be seen in the same vein, though candidates may be less likely to bring it up."}
{"text": "So that was interesting.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fought Hillary Clinton to a tie, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida polished his bronze medal and turned a would-be concession speech into a victory lap, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas marched to victory, and Donald J. Trump was faced with a loss he had to explain in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.Lets start with the most unanticipated result. Mrs. Clinton had seemed a clear winner in the last Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics, and her team felt confident of victory heading into the night. But Mr. Sanderss vote share was surprising to say the least and created the thing Mrs. Clinton least enjoys in her races  the element of surprise. Mrs. Clinton, who is behind in New Hampshire, now needs to fare well in the Nevada caucuses this month. And Mr. Sanders, who has already raised tens of millions of dollars with his populist message, seems newly energized and ready for a long fight.As for the Republicans, Mr. Cruzs victory validated his campaigns internal predictions. Mr. Rubio outperformed his poll numbers and heads into New Hampshire with a potential bounce. He shrewdly gave his speech before either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump, and offered essentially a version of the comeback kid speech from Bill Clintons second-place finish in New Hampshire in 1992.Mr. Cruz emerges as the strong favorite for anti-establishment voters and conservatives. Mr. Rubio potentially overtakes Mr. Trump and becomes the establishments best chance to stop Mr. Cruz, who now heads into New Hampshire having defied late predictions that he would lose in Iowa. But Mr. Trumps deeply negative attacks on Mr. Cruz, raising questions about his citizenship, appear to have backfired.Mr. Trump handled his second-place finish stoically, thanking Iowans and insisting he loved the state. But though the polls were wrong to show him winning, he couldnt shake his reliance on public surveys, noting that one in New Hampshire shows him up by 28 points. But that was conducted before the Iowa caucuses. There are several candidates vying for support in New Hampshire who are strong fits for the state, and Mr. Trump will face fresh pressure to show he can compete.What might save Mr. Trump, ironically, is the mess on the Democratic side. Instead of wall-to-wall coverage about his loss, the focus will largely be on Mr. Sanderss strong showing, giving Mr. Trump additional time to adjust. And then theres the ever-present question of whether Mr. Trump does something dramatic to regain the attention.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "NAIROBI, Kenya   A new report written for the African Union and made public on Monday presented an especially grim picture of South Sudans civil war, blaming government forces and rebels for the declining humanitarian situation in the worlds newest country.The nine-page report, written by an evaluation commission for the African Union and dated Jan. 29, listed five violations of a cease-fire agreement, including an episode in October in which government forces were responsible for the deaths of 50 people who died from suffocation inside a shipping container. Investigators said the rebels had looted United Nations barges and ambushed civilians, killing or wounding about a dozen people in an attack in December.There is limited consolidation of peace, a worrying economic decline and violence ongoing, the report said. The economy is in particularly dire straits, with foreign reserves rapidly diminishing, growing inflation and rapid depreciation of the national currency.South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, has been steeped in ethnic conflict since violence broke out in 2013. Thousands of people have died, thousands more are on the brink of starvation, and there have been repeated allegations of mass rape, massacres of civilians and forced cannibalism.According to another report, prepared by a United Nations panel of experts on South Sudan, both sides in the conflict are trying to build up their arsenals. The government recently bought three military helicopters that have led to the expansion of the war, and have emboldened those in the government who are seeking a military solution to the conflict at the expense of the peace process, the United Nations report said.The rebels were also trying to get more arms from numerous sources, though with comparatively limited success, that report added.Western powers and the African Union have tried to broker a lasting agreement between the government, which is dominated by the Dinka ethnic group, and the rebels, who are mostly Nuer, but so far the leaders from both sides appear to be opposed to any immediate reconciliation.A veteran American official who has followed the conflicts in Sudan and South Sudan closely for more than two decades said the violence in South Sudan was the worse it has ever been. I have never seen such brutality and pain, said the former official, who did not want to be named for fear of disrupting already tenuous negotiations between the warring parties in South Sudan.There are people on both sides who are reckless and obstructionists, he added."}

{"text": "DES MOINES  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, powered by a surge of support from evangelical Christians, dealt a humbling loss to Donald J. Trump in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, throwing into question the depth of support for Mr. Trumps unconventional candidacy.In the first contest of what so far has been more a populist revolt against the political order than a traditional Republican primary, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida finished a strong third, bolstering his case to consolidate the support of Republicans uneasy about the two top finishers.With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz had nearly 28 percent of the vote, Mr. Trump 24 percent and Mr. Rubio 23 percent.Mr. Cruzs victory was hard-earned. He fought off a barrage of attacks in the campaigns final weeks from Mr. Trump as well as from Iowas longtime governor, Terry E. Branstad, and Republican leaders in Washington who warned that the hard-line Mr. Cruz would lead the party to electoral disaster this fall.Having felled the brash Mr. Trump, who unceasingly predicted victory and dominated the race up until the first voting, Mr. Cruz can credibly portray himself, to conservatives who have yearned to unite behind a strong champion, as a giant-killer.To God be the glory, Mr. Cruz told jubilant supporters. Tonight is a victory for the grass roots. Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives all across Iowa and our great nation.The close race illustrated just how turbulent the Republican race may be, with the vote fragmenting between Mr. Cruzs evangelicals and Tea Party adherents, Mr. Trumps blue-collar political newcomers and Mr. Rubios mix of conservatives and pragmatic Republicans hungry for victory.Turnout was about 185,000, a record, according to Edison Research, which conducted entrance polls at precincts across the state. Mr. Trumps success had been expected to hinge on whether he could mobilize his supporters. But the turnout was not enough to deliver him a win, even though 46 percent of those who turned out were participating in a Republican caucus for the first time.Instead, Mr. Trump paid the price for building only a rudimentary political organization in the state: The brew of energy and anger powering his candidacy did not fully translate into votes.I love you people. I love you people, a subdued-sounding Mr. Trump unconvincingly told a crowd of Iowans in West Des Moines. We will go on to get the Republican nomination, and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw out there.Mr. Trumps celebrity-fueled airplane hangar rallies proved no match for Mr. Cruzs fervent appeal to Christian values in winning over Iowas evangelical voters, who made up nearly two-thirds of those who did show up to caucus. Mr. Cruz won about a third of the evangelical vote.That achievement was even more remarkable given the competition Mr. Cruz also faced from Mr. Rubio and Ben Carson, the spiritually minded retired neurosurgeon, among others. When Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and 2012, respectively, they did so without formidable opposition for those voters. (Each ran again this year but failed to earn significant backing.)The victory for Mr. Cruz also was a validation of the Iowa tradition that success here comes from intensive retail campaigning. He built an extensive organization and spent months visiting each of Iowas 99 counties.The throngs of Iowans who came to see Mr. Trumps improvisational performances, by contrast, may have come away entertained, but not enough of them seemed persuaded that he was presidential.The question for Mr. Cruz now is whether to compete aggressively in New Hampshire, which votes next Tuesday, or divide his time between there and the next battleground, South Carolina, which holds its primary on Feb. 20 and has an evangelical population closer in size to Iowas.Mr. Cruz has trailed well behind in recent New Hampshire polls, but Mr. Trump, his aura of invincibility gone, could prove vulnerable there as well. Should Mr. Cruz  whose $19 million war chest is the most money of any Republican candidate  find success with that states more secular voters, it would signal that he has the potential to unite a wider Republican electorate.Yet the strong Iowa finish by Mr. Rubio, the choice of a plurality of voters who said they made their decisions in the last week, will allow him to begin making the case to Republican donors, activists and elected officials that he is the strongest candidate acceptable to them who can win over grass-roots conservatives.Mr. Rubios late surge was a vindication of his strategy: He waited to aggressively compete in Iowa until January, when he crisscrossed the state furiously with 36 events in the final four weeks.Portraying his third-place showing in the best possible light, Mr. Rubio subtly took aim at both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump on Monday, suggesting they could not defeat Mrs. Clinton.When Im the nominee, we are going to unify our party and we are going to unify the conservative movement, Mr. Rubio said to hundreds of supporters in Des Moines.While Mr. Cruz, a pastors son, counted on Christian conservatives, Mr. Rubio aggressively tried to woo that constituency, too. He ran an ad in which he spoke of the free gift of Salvation offered to us by Jesus Christ. And in the final debate before the caucuses, held Thursday in Des Moines, he notably referred to Jesus Christ, who came down to earth and died for our sins.With the top finishers a businessman who had never run for office and two first-term senators, governing experience evidently mattered little to Iowans. The five current or former governors still running won a combined 8 percent  less than what the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson received, even after his campaign nearly unraveled in the weeks before the caucuses.After months of watching vast crowds wait hours in line to fill gymnasiums, many Iowans thought Mr. Trumps star power would shatter turnout records. It may have helped.But it was Mr. Cruz who benefited most. He won support from local conservative leaders, including Representative Steve King. And as Mr. Trump began to assail him, Mr. Cruz delivered sharp counterattacks over Mr. Trumps past liberal views, particularly on abortion rights.Mr. Cruz was also helped by Mr. Trumps self-inflicted wounds. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump spoke of the New Testaments Second Book of Corinthians as Two Corinthians, a telling lapse in the eyes of evangelicals. He proclaimed that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and still wouldnt lose voters. And Thursday, Mr. Trump skipped the only Republican debate held in Iowa to avoid a confrontation with Mr. Cruz and Fox News. It was enough to make Iowans uneasy.Perhaps most critically, though, Mr. Trump lacked the organization that Mr. Cruz had put into place in Iowa. Given his reliance on voters new to the caucus process, Mr. Trump needed a robust get-out-the-vote operation. But he was badly out-organized by Mr. Cruz, who relied on scores of church pastors and brought in hundreds of volunteers from as far as Idaho and Texas.Instead, Mr. Trump ran a campaign in his own self-regarding image. He defied historys lesson that the caucuses are won through one-on-one campaigning and humble requests of support. There were no community round-tables, no bus tour through courthouse towns and little in the way of unscripted interaction with voters outside of posing for pictures and signing autographs.What Iowa rituals Mr. Trump did submit to had a novelty quality to them, as when he made a show of stopping in at a Pizza Ranch restaurant, a campaign trail staple, and once stayed overnight at a Holiday Inn Express (Good mattress, he said).And when he indulged in the pandering to Iowa institutions that is typical of political supplicants here, he did so in his exaggerated, almost comic style  as if he were playing the role of presidential candidate.I am a great Christian, he assured Iowas voters who may have been skeptical about a thrice-married New York casino magnate. Mr. Trump also vowed to support the ethanol, referring to the federal biofuel subsidies prized by the agriculture industry here, while occasionally musing that he might just buy a farm in Iowa. And when Senator Charles E. Grassley came to one of his rallies, Mr. Trump did not evince much knowledge about the senators 40-year tenure in Congress but did say this is a great guy, this is a great guy.At times, Mr. Trump even mocked Iowans. He repeatedly noted that the winner of the Republican caucuses had not won the nomination in 16 years, chiding them for picking losers.In the final weekend, every public poll showed Mr. Trump winning. But Mr. Trumps problems were registering with Mr. Cruzs camp.Mr. Cruzs campaign manager, Jeff Roe, was coolly confident. Late Sunday, he nonchalantly assured a reporter of victory, saying that Mr. Trump was sliding and might even finish third."}

{"text": "A good negotiator needs to be able to walk away.That is a rule that, surely, Donald Trump knows. And yet in suggesting that Medicare could find big discounts by letting the government negotiate directly over drug prices, he seems to have forgotten it.Mr. Trump has joined Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in calling for a federal government program to negotiate for Medicares drug prices. The current system has private insurance companies each negotiating separate deals on behalf of large groups of Medicare patients. Right now, the program is O.K. at negotiating, saving as much as 30 percent off the list price of drugs, according to government reports. But Medicare still pays much, much more than government health systems in other countries.The idea of government directly negotiating with drug makers has been a liberal favorite ever since Medicare began paying for drugs 10 years ago. You can see the appeal. The thinking goes like this: Medicares drug plans cover about 37 million people. Maybe if it bargained on behalf of all those beneficiaries as one, instead of dividing them into a series of smaller groups, it could get better deals. Other countries, like Britain, where the government purchases drugs for everyone in bulk, pay much, much less for drugs than the United States. In those countries, private companies dont do the negotiating; the government does. And they dont split the big market.We dont do it, Mr. Trump said at a Farmington, N.H., campaign event, according to The Associated Press. Why? Because of drug companies.But if you talk to experts who study the pharmaceutical market in the United States, they arent optimistic that, by itself, letting the government play drug negotiator would take a big bite out of prescription drug spending.For one, the companies that run the Medicare drug plans arent really that small, because they also provide drug benefits to companies and individuals with health insurance. The largest pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts, covers more than 85 million Americans. Other big pharmacy benefit managers include CVS/Caremark and OptumRx.But size isnt the only issue. The real problem is that Medicare can very rarely say No way to a drug company. Medicare beneficiaries wanted the program to cover most drugs that older people would want to use. So Congress put in place rules that strengthen the hand of the drug companies in negotiations.Medicare is required to cover almost every cancer treatment that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, for example, one of six categories where the drug plans can almost never say no to the drug companies. If a drug maker comes out with a new cancer medicine with a sky-high price, theres not much a Medicare plan can do to talk it down.If you say, We need to get lower prices, and they just say, No, what are you going to do? said Walid Gellad, an associate professor of medicine and the co-director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.The Congressional Budget Office has examined several proposals to allow the government to negotiate on drug prices, and it has repeatedly said that the savings would be negligible without other major policy changes. Medicares actuary has reached similar conclusions.To negotiate prices any further, the government would need to impose access or coverage restrictions on medicines, said Doug Elmendorf, testifying before Congress in 2009. Elmendorf was the director of the budget office then; he is now the dean of Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government.The government does have one program that can say no to drug companies, and it gets much better deals than Medicare. The Department of Veterans Affairs negotiates hard with drugmakers. But it is also bound by fewer rules than Medicare, and one result is that it covers far fewer drugs.A 2011 analysis by Austin Frakt, an economist and Upshot contributor, and two co-authors found that if Medicare limited drugs the way the V.A. does, it could save about $510 in drug spending for every beneficiary every year. But those beneficiaries would lose access to many drugs they were previously taking. In fact, many older patients who get their health insurance from the V.A. also sign up for Medicare drug plans to cover medicines that the V.A. wont.Other countries act more like the V.A. than Medicare. In Britain, drug makers that wont negotiate wont be able to sell any drugs at all. Thats real leverage, but it also means that patients in England dont have access to all the drugs that older people in the United States might want to take.The trade-offs between price and generosity are real and wrenching. None of the candidates currently talking about allowing Medicare to negotiate for drugs have endorsed allowing Medicare to say no more often. Bernie Sanderss plan strongly suggests that all drugs would be covered with no co-payments at all. Such a plan might make the government a more generous insurer than it is now, but could also result in even higher drug prices."}
{"text": "David Bowies music was a staple of the mens fashion shows that recently concluded in Europe, and it was back for the start of the mens fashion week in New York as the first model made his way down the runway for Joseph Abboud.The song, Cat People (Putting Out Fire), was originally released in 1982, five years before Mr. Abboud started his namesake collection. The designer went on to become an icon of American mens wear in the 1980s and 1990s, but he eventually lost the rights to his name.The last time he had a fashion show was 15 years ago. But after taking the job of chief creative director at Mens Wearhouse, now known as Tailored Brands, he was able to reclaim the Joseph Abboud label for himself in 2013.Many young mens wear enthusiasts may not have heard of Mr. Abboud. But their dads have, the 65-year-old designer said backstage, after a rehearsal for the show.He recalled showing his collection 24 years ago at the American Museum of Natural History, where he carried his infant daughter down the runway for his bow. Shes too big to carry now, he said.So when Mr. Abboud speaks about mens wear, he does so with authority. Mens wear has never been this exciting, he said. Not since the late 60s and early 70s, when there was this whole peacock revolution that changed the way men dress.Mr. Abboud, wearing a trim waist coat and silk scarf, described his new collection as an American take on Londons Savile Row. But weve pushed it to a theatrical level, he said.The suits on display Tuesday morning came with ruffled pocket squares or lapel pins with feathers tall enough to tickle the models chins. The patterns were psychedelic mash-ups of herringbone, paisley, tweed and velvet.The tradition-minded tailors of Savile Row may not be so keen on such flourishes, and the Boston-born Mr. Abboud is about as American as it gets. All of his suits are made at his factory in Massachusetts, where he employs 800 artisans, and some of the models walking his runway wore American flag print scarves.But he did have one British fan in attendance: the actor Russell Tovey, a star of the Broadway revival of Arthur Millers A View From the Bridge. He sat front row, next to the Bravo talk show host Andy Cohen, and he was wearing a Joseph Abboud turtleneck and suit tailored by Mr. Abboud himself at the brands Madison Avenue store. It was a massive treat, Mr. Tovey said backstage. Hes a legend. And the store is wonderful.After Mr. Abboud took his bow, many in attendance shuffled out and into the presentation of Stampd, a young Californian brand showing for the first time. The bomber jackets, tailored track pants and elongated sweats and tees looked much more like what was being worn by many of the fashionable guys in the crowd.But that is not something that would phase Mr. Abboud. To me, theres nothing sexier than a guy in a well-tailored suit, he said. Sportswear is great, but not every designer can do tailored."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Many of the movies that played at this years Sundance Film Festival, which ended on Sunday, have already been forgotten. Its harsh but true. Buzz comes and goes fast in the social media age.But David Larkin says he believes he has a digital solution.Mr. Larkin is the chief executive of Plexus Entertainment, a start-up behind the website and app GoWatchIt. The service has multiple functions, but a primary one allows users to add the titles of unreleased movies to a digital queue. When the film does become available, GoWatchIt sends an alert. Mr. Larkins research indicates that Sundance entries are released, on average, 206 days after their festival premieres.Its pretty obvious that more people read about and are interested in Sundance films than actually go to Sundance, but the challenge is converting that buzz into paying customers, Mr. Larkin said. Generating awareness is great, but it does very little good unless the consumers you have made aware are then escorted to a purchase.GoWatchIt expanded its partnership with Sundance this year  there was a GoWatchIt button on each page of the festivals digital program guide  and Mr. Larkin said that low tens of thousands of people added films to queues. For the art films that play Sundance, that could be an impactful number, helping kick-start word of mouth for a limited theatrical run or helping get on the iTunes top-seller list, he said.Mr. Larkin said that tests showed that GoWatchIt users opened emails notifying them of film availability in theaters, or on sites like Amazon, Netflix and iTunes, at a rate of up to 62 percent and then click through to a movie service where a film can be bought or rented in up to 18 percent of cases. Those rates are sharply higher than the industry norm for entertainment-related emails, according to Constant Contact, an online marketing company.GoWatchIt makes money by charging fees to studios like Warner Bros., Universal and Paramount for access to the sites data for specific films. (The company has a partnership with the online movie section of The New York Times.)Mr. Larkin, whose association with the entertainment business started in 1984 when he was production manager for a stoner comedy called Hollywood Hot Tubs, got the idea for GoWatchIt after a film he helped produce, Made In China, won an award at the 2009 South by Southwest film festival. But everyone promptly forgot about us, Mr. Larkin said. The buzz slipped through our fingers."}

But where are the voters who would support them?We know, not only from the Trump campaign, but also from the successes of Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin and others, that pandering to the anxieties of lower-income, less-educated or older white voters is where we find the most energy today in American politics. The debate and the division are driven by the skillful manipulators of economic and cultural anxieties, both real and perceived.Those most susceptible voters are, by now, immune to evidence and rational argument. Our media and political environment is built to reassure them hourly about how right they are, to more deeply fix them in a one-sided worldview.We are past mere political division. We have embarked on a more visceral era in which emotion supersedes political discussion. A reasonable argument is no longer enough. Somehow, we must address those anxieties to reclaim the place of reason in our political life. We must abandon the idea that there are only two sides to our politics, a left and a right. Politics becomes something better when we look above the divide and see problems not from two sides but from all sides.STEVEN P.

{"text": "As depicted in popular culture, ancient Egypt is awash with the color beige. A trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art would seem to reflect that notion: The Temple of Dendur, with its weatherworn sandstone, could fit in naturally with the earth tones of Aida or The Mummy.But Egyptologists know that this temple, like many others of the ancient world, was painted with vivid colors and patterns. In Color the Temple, a marriage of research and projection-mapping technology, visitors to the Met can now glimpse what the Temple of Dendur may have looked like in its original, polychromatic form more than 2,000 years ago.The Mets MediaLab has installed a projector that fills in the temples carvings with color. Through March 19, one section of the structures south side is on view: a scene of the Roman emperor Augustus, dressed as a pharaoh and making an offering to the deities Hathor and Horus. Because the sun would wash out the projectors light (the gallery has floor-to-ceiling windows), the scene is illuminated on Friday and Saturday evenings, when the Met offers extended hours.Ron Jenkins, 63, a theater professor at Wesleyan University, visited the Temple of Dendur on Friday with his 4-year-old son, Nicander. Mr. Jenkins said that he might have heard before that Egyptian temples were painted, but he was surprised by how rich and fresh the colors appeared in person. You feel closer to the creators, he said. Its not just dead stone.The stone has long appeared lifeless to the naked eye. Threatened by its location on the banks of the Nile, the temple was subjected to centuries of annual flooding that stripped away the painted exterior. Still, in a 1906 survey Aylward Blackman, the British Egyptologist, wrote about painted scenes on the temples interior walls; he even drew diagrams that later proved handy for the Met. By the 1920s, Dendur was flooded nine months of the year, which contributed to further erosion.In the mid-1960s, Unesco led a salvage campaign that eventually moved the temple to the United States, and President Lyndon B. Johnson gave it to the Met in 1967. By then, no visible color remained. We tried to find paint, said Marsha Hill, a curator in the Mets Egyptian art department, but so far, nothing. Even using imaging technology, the Met has been unable to detect any color.But bringing this temples colors to life became increasingly possible with the advent of the MediaLab and the arrival in 2013 of Erin Peters, then a fellow in the Mets Egyptian art department and a doctoral candidate whose research included ancient polychromy.Ms. Peters helped provide information on how the Temple of Dendur could have looked when it was constructed around 15 B.C. Guiding her were Mr. Blackmans survey, as well as illustrated, colored temples in the Napoleon-era publications Description de lgypte. The publications depicted brilliant paint inside the Temple of Hathor, from the same period as the Temple of Dendur.Eventually, Ms. Hill said, the Met arrived at a safe, confident idea of how the scene currently on view may have looked: Augustus in a white kilt, Horus colored a rich blue and Hathor with white skin and wearing purple. But, she said, in the Roman period, they started doing pretty wonderful things with paint. Kilts could have been colored with patterns, for example, or depictions of battle scenes. And the paint may have been finished with a wax or varnish to look bejeweled, she added.The MediaLab created alternate projections for those other possibilities, including one in which the entire temple is painted with a white background. Marco Castro Cosio, manager of the MediaLab, said the different patterns would be on view. His team can change the display to show the various options and to highlight objects in the scene  a useful tool for talks and tours.Mr. Castro said that visitors could expect projection mapping to appear elsewhere at the Met. He would even like to color the north side of the Temple of Dendur so people in Central Park could see it through the windows. Wed love to do all of the scenes, he said. But, he added, creating this first one took two years, and its a big temple."}
{"text": "For most of the past four years, Apple has reigned supreme as the worlds most valuable company. Now theres a new holder of the crown: Alphabet.Alphabet, formerly known as Google, reported strong quarterly results on Monday that propelled its stock upwards in after-hours trading. Based on that lift, Alphabet exceeded Apple in market capitalization when the stock began trading on Tuesday morning. Each company is worth more than $500 billion.Alphabet investors were particularly happy, writes Conor Dougherty, because the company revealed the financials of its different businesses  including its Verily health-care subsidiary and its Nest smart devices unit  for the first time, separating them out from the core Google business. That gave a clearer picture of Googles ad business  and the picture was very strong indeed.Apple, in contrast, is entering a period of slower growth. Last month, the company reported a less than 1 percent rise in quarterly iPhone sales, the lowest increase ever and a far cry from the double-digit gains that investors had grown accustomed to.Tuesday is set to bring Yahoos quarterly earnings, which may send its stock on a very different trajectory than Alphabets. Marissa Mayer, Yahoos chief executive, is under pressure to give details of her plan to spin off the companys core business. Adding to Ms. Mayers woes, a former Yahoo manager on Monday sued the company for using an employee-ranking system that he alleged was discriminatory and a violation of federal and California laws governing mass layoffs."}
{"text": "The E. coli outbreaks at Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in the United States appear to be over, but investigators have been unable to trace the cause of the sickness, federal authorities said on Monday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had investigated two outbreaks that occurred last year: one in 11 states that sickened 55 people and another that sickened five people in three states. Twenty-two people were admitted to hospitals. There were no deaths.The C.D.C. said in a statement that a common meal or ingredient served at the restaurants was a likely source of the outbreaks, but investigators were unable to specify the food or ingredient responsible for the contamination.Most ill people in these outbreaks ate many of the same food items at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant, the statement said. When a restaurant serves foods with several ingredients that are mixed or cooked together and then used in multiple menu items, it can be more difficult for epidemiologic studies to identify the specific ingredient that is contaminated.On Monday, the companys stock price closed up more than 4 percent. The company was scheduled to hold an investors conference call on Tuesday to discuss Chipotles last-quarter earnings.A Chipotle spokesman, Chris Arnold, said in a statement on Monday that the company was pleased that the C.D.C. had concluded its investigation.Over the past few months we have taken significant steps to improve the safety of all of the food we serve, and we are confident that the changes we have made mean that every item on our menu is delicious and safe, he said.The first outbreak was detected in October by health officials in Washington State and Oregon, and then other people who fell ill in other states were identified through Dec. 1. The second outbreak, of a different E. coli strain, was reported in November in Kansas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.Chipotle has been trying to recover from the contaminations, which caused some of its customers to shun the restaurants. The chain, which has more than 2,000 locations, said last month that it would shut all its stores for several hours on Feb. 8 to hold food-safety meetings with employees."}
{"text": "Rose Wang, a frequent traveler, is willing to concede that she sort of misses the kitschy SkyMall catalog and its quirky roundup of gadgets, pet accessories and other oddities.But Ms. Wang, who lives in the Washington area and is a consultant to government contractors, is less than enthusiastic about what she perceives as a creeping influx of retail pitches that she encounters while in flight.When you get on the entertainment console, there are more ads, and if you log onto the Wi-Fi, of course, theres ads, she said.Airlines say they are just giving passengers what they want: a chance to shop.Theyre looking for other things to entertain themselves, said Jamie Perry, vice president for brand and product development at JetBlue Airways.Its all made possible with the advent of Wi-Fi on planes. Short of a patient in a dentists chair, its hard to find a more captive audience than airline passengers.When JetBlue added its Fly-Fi wireless network a little more than two years ago, Mr. Perry said the airline initially anticipated that travelers would mostly be interested in logging onto social networks during flights.It was a little bit of a surprise to us, early on, how much time people spent shopping, he said.Airlines are counting on nimbler technology and faster, more reliable Wi-Fi in the air to deliver virtual catalogs, promotions and a host of goods and services.They are betting that passengers will warm to the idea of browsing via the seat-back entertainment console or their own devices at cruising altitude  and are counting on getting a piece of what GuestLogix, a travel retailing technology company, says is a $5 billion annual business, either directly or through affiliate programs.Where were starting to see this is in the airlines that have made the big investments in in-flight Wi-Fi, said Michael Reyes, director of customer centricity at Sabre Airline Solutions.Theyve always been chasing ways to find new revenues, he said. The big difference now is the connectivity. They can have a lot more data piped up to the plane.The onboard retail market is growing at a 13 percent rate, year over year, according to Craig Proud, senior vice president for platform at GuestLogix.The technology is there, he said. Based on our experience, the market opportunity is still really huge, but merchandising is the key to success.In November, LSG Sky Chefs, an airline catering company and a division of Lufthansa Group, acquired one of its partners, the Irish technology company Retail inMotion, to help it expand into what it called the increasingly important onboard retail business. In a release, LSG Sky Chefs said its intention was to sell passengers everything from merchandise to tickets for events or attractions at the flights destination.We see the growth rate much bigger than the growth of passengers, said Stefan Patermann, Retail inMotions chief commercial officer, estimating the onboard retail market in Europe alone to be worth about 1 billion euros, or about $1.09 billion, a year.Analysts say this evolution was only a matter of time: The unbundling of services and amenities like food and preferred seats in coach cabins made the buy-on-board retail model standard. At the same time, a fast, unbroken Wi-Fi connection eases onboard shopping and allows airlines to process credit card transactions in real time.Carriers are finding more ways to push more offers through that technology, said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant.What airlines see as a new revenue stream, though, some travelers see as an irritant, especially in a market in which airlines are already earning eye-popping profits.Industry consolidation, fuller planes and the falling price of oil combined to deliver nearly $19 billion in profits for the domestic airline industry in the first three quarters of 2015, according to the Department of Transportation.Everybodys pushing retail at you, said James Condon, a consultant who lives in the Washington area and travels frequently for work. He said that marketing seemed heaviest on international flights, where the airlines window of time to make pitches to customers is longest.Some carriers seek an alternative to the hard sell. Virgin America goes for a feel-good sentiment with its in-flight retailing, letting travelers purchase carbon offsets to help reduce the environmental impact of their trips, or make charitable donations. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic take a selective approach.Were always looking for bespoke and unique products that are exclusive to Virgin Atlantic, a representative for that airline said via email.Late last year, JetBlue teamed up with Amazon to make Amazons library of media available to Prime members as well as to passengers who sign up for a free trial or a subscription to the service, which a surprising number do.Weve seen a very high uptake of Amazon Prime from people who were not previously Prime, Mr. Perry said. It seems that the carrot of free video streaming onboard is quite an attractive one.The airline also has promoted a sweepstakes that passengers enter by signing up for J. Crews mailing list, and giveaways from Dunkin Donuts for joining the chains loyalty program through JetBlues platform. By the middle of this year, Mr. Perry said, JetBlue hopes to let members of its frequent-flier program earn loyalty points when they shop on Amazon in flight.Unlike most other airlines, JetBlue offers its basic Wi-Fi free. (Passengers can pay for more speed.) The carrier calculates that its investment will pay off in the long run as more people browse and buy items or subscribe to services, effectively subsidizing the Wi-Fi and earning JetBlue extra revenue.Once you have a free model, essentially what youre monetizing is eyeballs, Mr. Perry said.Abby Lunardini, vice president for brand marketing and communications at Virgin America, said that a technology upgrade the carrier began last year would let it offer an array of goods and services, along with promotions for media and entertainment providers like Netflix and Spotify.It certainly opens up a whole new range of possibilities, she said, adding that Virgin America wanted to make its offers in an unobtrusive way.For travelers like Mr. Condon, anything that makes the in-flight offers less obtrusive would be an improvement. Frankly, its annoying, he said. Essentially, theyve taken the SkyMall catalog and put it in electronic format."}
{"text": "CIUDAD DE MXICO  El domingo, poco despus del sonar de las trompetas, Jos Toms ya estaba en terreno conocido: a centmetros de unos cuernos, tan cerca que hasta rozaban el traje de luces de seda rosada que vesta.El matador no movi un msculo, para no provocar al toro, y se mantuvo firme, solo, en el centro de la Plaza de Mxico, la ms grande del mundo. El culto a este torero es tal que sus seguidores son llamados Tomasistas y este domingo ms de 45.000 espectadores acudieron a la plaza, la mayor asistencia en la historia reciente de La Monumental.Todos estaban ansiosos por presenciar una faena del Grande antes de que decida retirarse, o antes que una cornada termine su carrera por l.Jos Toms, de 40 aos, no es como otros matadores. Es la encarnacin del misterio, dentro y fuera del ruedo. Por aos se ha negado a conceder entrevistas o a aparecer en televisin. Para verlo hay que verlo en vivo, y sus actuaciones son tan escasas (una o dos al ao) que las entradas se agotan en pocas horas.Las actuaciones de Jos Toms son un ballet salvaje, una mezcla de elegancia, arrojo, ritmo y sacrificio. Parece determinado a acercarse a los toros tanto como sea posible, llevando al lmite la cercana que cualquier hombre puede tener ante el animal.Es un mstico, afirm Allen Josephs, profesor de literatura y estudios espaoles de la Universidad de West Florida, y quien ha escrito bastante sobre matadores y toros en la revista True.Ink. Queremos que el gran matador se acerque cada vez ms al animal. Juega con la muerte. Por qu? Porque al jugar con la muerte, de alguna manera, la superamos.Al superar la muerte, Jos Toms es un smbolo de inmortalidad, pero ah estaba el domingo, balanceando su muleta roja tras su espalda mientras que Bellotero, de 522 kilos, su primer toro de la tarde, contemplaba su minscula cintura. Finalmente, Jos Toms hizo un pase y la multitud explot.Ol!Otro pase.Ol!Entonces se acerc demasiado. Un cuerno se ator en la parte interior de su pierna. Se estrell contra la arena del ruedo y el pblico gritaba mientras el toro atacaba sus muslos.Cuando era adolescente en un suburbio de Madrid, donde las escuelas de toreo son quiz las ms competitivas de Espaa, a Jos Toms le cost conquistar la atencin de los promotores, los apoderados y los empresarios que apadrinan a los jvenes matadores. Se mud a Mxico para conseguir esa atencin y perfeccion un estilo tan peligroso que casi le ha costado la vida en ms de una ocasin.En 2010, en Aguascalientes, Mxico, el torero haba terminado un pase, casi sin esfuerzo, cuando un toro le clav un cuerno en el muslo izquierdo. Le perfor la arteria femoral y caus una peligrosa hemorragia. Por un momento no era claro si sobrevivira.Cuando tu mente se ha acostumbrado al hecho de que te vas a morir y no te mueres, la vida se torna de otro color, afirma Antonio Barrera, un matador que ha resistido numerosas cogidas y que casi se desangra cuando era un adolescente por una herida similar a la de Jos Toms en Aguascalientes. En 2012, Barrera habl para el documental Gored, que captura su ltima corrida y retrata cmo el haber superado la muerte le ha permitido abandonarse al momento de actuar.Para m, el toro es como un dios, comenta Barrera. El toro salvaje tiene valores que comparte con el ser humano: es feroz, es impetuoso, tiene casta, tiene autoestima, pelea por lo que quiere, pelea por su vida. Por eso lo consideras un dios y por eso en muchas culturas tambin se le considera as.El toreo es ms una religin que un deporte, ms sacrificio que matanza, un ritual remanente del mundo antiguo. Entre los faraones de Egipto, las tribus nmadas del Levante, los anfiteatros cretenses y griegos, los toros eran deidades.Para estas personas, el toro se convierte en un smbolo del poder y fertilidad, escribi Jack Randolph Conrad en The Horn and the Sword, un estudio antropolgico sobre la relacin entre el toro y el ser humano.En el antiguo Egipto, las mujeres aparecan desnudas frente a los toros para absorber su fertilidad y los soldados romanos se baaban en sangre de toro y coman sus testculos para ganar su inmortalidad. Los toros eran sacrificados en rituales liderados por sacerdotes taurinos, que entregaban sus dotes al pblico. El toreo moderno puede interpretarse como un pariente lejano y una versin comercial de estos ritos arcaicos.El sacrificio es la esencia, dijo Josephs. Los matadores son los nicos sacerdotes taurinos que quedan de esos das paganos.El domingo, en la Plaza Mxico, mientras Jos Toms sufra en la arena, sus ayudantes alejaron a Bellotero. Pero no por mucho tiempo. Unos pocos pases despus, luego de que el toro clavara sus cuernos en el interior de su chaquetilla, Toms estaba de nuevo en el suelo. De alguna manera los pitones no le alcanzaron y Toms logr una actuacin notable. Sus derechazos largos y sus pases suaves estuvieron perfectamente sincronizados. Luego clav la espada con limpieza y se gan una oreja pese a que el pblico peda dos, un honor parecido al de salir en hombros de la plaza.A m me produce una gama entera de emociones, dijo Pedro Prez, un Tomasista, mientras que Jos Toms regresaba a la barrera con el rostro cubierto de arena. No s si estar feliz o triste, si quiero aplaudir o llorar. Nunca sabes qu ocurrir despus.Prez haba llegado temprano desde Tlaxcala, un estado a unas dos horas de la capital mexicana, y se sorprendi cuando vio las calles aledaas repletas de gente. Los vendedores sacaron asadores y paelleras, y las mesas de los restaurantes estaban llenas de aficionados con sombreros y fulares que disfrutaban tacos de camarn con salsa de queso y unas micheladas.Sorprendentemente era difcil encontrarse con activistas defensores de los derechos de los animales, que se han ganado una presencia en la Ciudad de Mxico con sus discursos que dicen que un acto tan cruel como el toreo debera abolirse en los sitios que an celebran la fiesta: el sur de Francia, Espaa (con la excepcin de Catalua), Portugal, Per, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela y Mxico.La corrida aqu, cuyo cartel formaron Jos Toms y Joselito Adame, un matador mexicano, ha sido la ms grande de la temporada de invierno. Antes de que abrieran las puertas, algunos asientos de primera fila se revendan en sitios web por ms de 8.000 dlares.El toreo ha sufrido un importante golpe financiero en los ltimos aos por las protestas, las prohibiciones y la crisis econmica en Espaa, pero Jos Toms ha sido considerado una suerte de salvador de un espectculo que desfallece. Una figura solitaria que, con su valenta y su arte, todava puede inspirar a una nueva generacin de entusiastas.Pero dentro de la plaza, mientras el sol acaeca y las luces se encendan, Jos Toms no lo tuvo fcil. A su segundo toro le hizo falta fuerza y, pese al cuidado de algunos pases que cortaban el aliento, fall y no pudo rematar la faena con la espada al primer intento.Y con el ltimo toro nunca tuvo una oportunidad. Cuando sali el animal, la multitud, frustrada, lo recibi con silbidos. El toro, pese a su velocidad, era muy pequeo, segn el juicio de los aficionados. Pidieron que se reemplazara al animal. Este otro tambin era pequeo y falto de fuerzas, y Jos Toms no tuvo otra opcin ms que matarlo rpido para terminar su faena ms decepcionante en aos.Adame, entonces, aprovech el momento. Con el ltimo toro de la tarde, hizo todos los trucos para ganarse al pblico. Se arrodill, hizo giros con el capote y se acerc tanto al toro que le toc los cuernos con los dedos.Hasta intent un estilo peligroso para la estocada final, el recibiendo, que consiste en dar la estocada mientras el toro le embiste de frente. El movimiento coron una faena en la que estuvo ausente la poesa de Jos Tomas. Adame, y no Jos Toms, sali en hombros de la plaza mientras que algunos aficionados tocaban su mano, su traje de luces, o cualquier parte que pudieran alcanzar. Como si estuvieran tocando a un santo.De regreso en su hotel, Jos Toms sali a cenar con su crculo. Vesta jeans negros, zapatos oscuros y una bufanda. Le preguntaron como se senta.Qu puede hacer uno?, respondi y sacudi la cabeza. Se vea hosco y desanimado, como cualquier matador, un mortal tras una tarde difcil, ya no el misterioso dios de los toros que tanta gente haba venido a ver."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   President Obama plans to substantially increase the deployment of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and other equipment to NATO countries in Central and Eastern Europe, a move that administration officials said was aimed at deterring Russia from further aggression in the region.The White House plans to pay for the additional weapons and equipment with a budget request of more than $3.4 billion for military spending in Europe in 2017, several officials said Monday, more than quadrupling the current budget of $789 million. The weapons and equipment will be used by American and NATO forces, ensuring that the alliance can maintain a full armored combat brigade in the region at all times.Though Russias military activity has quieted in eastern Ukraine in recent months, Moscow continues to maintain a presence there, working with pro-Russian local forces. Administration officials said the additional NATO forces were calculated to send a signal to President Vladimir V. Putin that the West remained deeply suspicious of his motives in the region.This is not a response to something that happened last Tuesday, a senior administration official said. This is a longer-term response to a changed security environment in Europe. This reflects a new situation, where Russia has become a more difficult actor.It is not clear how Russia will react to the fortified military presence along NATOs eastern flank. Since the signing of a cease-fire agreement last year, Mr. Putins government has tried to ease tensions with the West. Officials said the Russian government was eager for the United States and Europe to roll back economic sanctions, which suggested that it would not escalate tensions over the new military commitments.But outside analysts were surprised by the magnitude of the increase in military funding for Europe, which is part of an overall budget request of $580 billion for the Pentagon. Mr. Obama, according to a defense official, is also going to ask Congress for a 35 percent increase  $7 billion  to fight Islamic State militants.Some analysts said the increased funding and deployments would certainly rattle Russia. Among the countries where the equipment and additional forces could be deployed are Hungary, Romania and the Baltic countries, Pentagon officials said.This is a really big deal, and the Russians are going to have a cow, said Evelyn N. Farkas, who until October was the Pentagons top policy official on Russia and Ukraine. Its a huge sign of commitment to deterring Russia, and to strengthening our alliance and our partnership with countries like Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.While the increase in funding for Europe is significant, the administration is proposing that the money come from a separate war-funding account that is meant to pay for operations in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, as well as the continued American military presence in Afghanistan. That means it is a one-time request, not necessarily a continuing commitment built in to budget requests beyond 2017, officials said.Its a way to get around the budget caps imposed on the Pentagon, said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.But, Mr. Harrison added, the budget workaround may not succeed in reassuring fretful Eastern European allies because it leaves the decision on what do about future military spending in Europe for the next administration.If you want to be reassuring to our allies in Europe, he said, youve got to show youve got a future plan.Administration officials said the new investments were not just about deterring Russia. The weapons and equipment could also be deployed along NATOs southern flank, where they could help in the fight against the Islamic State or in dealing with the influx of migrants from Syria.Initially, we were focusing on reassurance, said one of the senior officials, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal military planning. But while that was happening, we were stepping back and asking how to address the changed environment in a more programmatic and consistent way.Still, there is no doubt the primary target of the funding is Russia. Administration officials said that two years after its annexation of Crimea  an annexation that neither the United States nor its European allies recognize  it was imperative to send Moscow a message that NATO will do all it needs to do in order to stand behind Eastern European members worried that they could be next.Russia has invested heavily in its military, transforming a cumbersome, Soviet-style army into a lighter, more flexible force, with the ability to carry out rapid interventions. That, combined with Mr. Putins willingness to use the military to expand Russias influence outside its borders, necessitated a stronger deterrent force, officials said.Applying this budget to Europe fulfills promises weve made to NATO on the collective defense of the alliance, a senior defense official said Monday. But it also shows our commitment and resolve to individual countries to which we will be putting a persistent rotational presence of forces to demonstrate our resolve in their, and our, collective defenses.He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the budget.The official said the Pentagon wanted a heel to toe rotational troop presence in Eastern Europe, meaning that there would always be the equivalent of a brigade in the region. Under a 1997 agreement known as the NATO-Russia Founding Act, both sides pledged not to station large numbers of troops along their respective borders.Administration officials said they were confident that the new deployments would not be seen as breaching that agreement. In any event, Poland and the Baltic States argue that Russias incursion in Ukraine was a clear violation of the act, and that NATO should no longer abide by it.Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was in Brussels two weeks ago at a NATO defense meeting, where Eastern European countries again expressed concerns about Russia. In particular, representatives from the Baltic nations  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  have been asking for a big statement of American military support, officials said.This is a message that we see what theyre capable of, and what their political leadership is willing to do, said another senior administration official, in a reference to Russia."}
{"text": "Given Irans recent nuclear deal with the West, the lifting of economic sanctions and political maneuvering before this months parliamentary elections (in which hard-liners have tried to disqualify large numbers of moderates and reformists from running), Laura Secors new book about Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution could not be more timely.In Children of Paradise, Ms. Secor  who has written about Iran for The New Yorker, The New York Times and Foreign Affairs, among other publications  indelibly portrays the journalists, dissidents, reformers and student activists who have fought bravely for their ideals in a country where voicing ones beliefs has often led to imprisonment, torture and death.As described by Ms. Secor, their ordeals often read like Kafkaesque nightmares in which nearly every Iranian was guilty of something that could carry a prison sentence or worse, be punished by death (apostasy, alcohol consumption and crimes against chastity). Or like monstrous fairy tales, complete with secret prisons and miracle rooms, where torture (savage beatings, sexual humiliation, sleep deprivation and mock executions) was used to extract forced confessions.Some of those profiled began as anti-Western militants involved in the taking of American hostages and evolved into proponents of democratic reform. Some began as revolutionaries with the highest hopes of creating a new Islamic state with room for liberal, humanist ideas, only to find themselves in the crosshairs of extremists, intent on cementing their own power and crushing all dissent. Some tried to maintain political viability by trying to triangulate among the many factions in Iranian politics. And some were killed or forced into exile after excruciating stints in prison and threats against their relatives and friends.Ms. Secors portraits create an impressionistic montage of Iranian life during the last 37 years, which is hugely valuable in helping us understand Irans complex back story. Indeed, as this book underscores, todays battles between hard-liners and more moderate and reformist forces are part of a historical clash between political and religious principles, as well as tensions between nationalistic yearnings for authenticity and a philosophical openness to (even fascination with) Western ideas and ideals.Drawing parallels between Irans revolution and the classic template of revolution described by the historian Crane Brinton in The Anatomy of Revolution, Ms. Secor points out that revolutionary Irans first political leaders like Mehdi Bazargan and Abolhassan Bani-Sadr were moderates, but that they were soon driven out of government by radicals, who consolidated power and put into effect what Brinton would have called a reign of terror and virtue.So many enemies of God were executed in the summer of 1988, following a fatwa issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini, she writes, that executioners complained of overwork and asked to use firing squads, but silence and secrecy were of the essence. According to one former official, she says, prisoners were loaded onto forklifts and lifted onto six cranes from which they were hanged  for some two months, this reportedly went on every half hour from 7:30 in the morning until 5 oclock in the evening.The problem with Children of Paradise is that it can feel haphazardly assembled, hopping and skipping around, and sometimes providing only a fuzzy sense of political context. For instance, it skims over the reverberating consequences of the C.I.A.s orchestration of the 1953 coup that ousted Mohammad Mossadegh, Irans prime minister. And the book sharply truncates an account of the 2009 democratic Green movement and the brutal crackdown unleashed on its protesters by Khomeneis successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The volume also ends abruptly, skating over the presidency of Hassan Rouhani and his efforts to contend with hard-liners, eager to squash his more moderate policies and outreach to the West.What Ms. Secor does do in this book  with intense emotion  is convey the often harrowing stories of her subjects lives: their hopes, their aspirations and the often terrible prices they paid for dissent. Theres the writer Akbar Ganji, a Revolutionary Guardsman in the 1980s, who became a liberal agitator and one of the Islamic Republics most formidable political prisoners. And theres Abbas Amir Entezam, who served under Mehdi Bazargan (the countrys first prime minister after the revolution, who appealed for moderation); he became known, Ms. Secor writes, as Irans Nelson Mandela, serving some 27 years in prison or under house arrest  two and a half of those in a cell so crowded that the inmates took turns sleeping on the floor, each of them getting just three hours of sleep every 24 hours.Among the most haunting stories recounted in these pages is that of two brothers, Akbar and Manouchehr Mohammadi, who led a secular student group and who were found guilty of waging war against God. Though their death sentences were commuted, Ms. Secor reports, they were tortured horribly in prison: Akbar refused to implicate his brother in a foreign plot against the state and was beaten so badly that a disk in his spine ruptured and he suffered internal bleeding from his kidneys and stomach. He mounted a hunger strike in 2006 as a plea for medical care, Ms. Secor writes, but after being given an unspecified medicine, his condition worsened and he was left on a stretcher to die.Under pressure from the media and international human rights groups, the judiciary granted Manouchehr  whose vertebrae had been fractured by prison beatings  a furlough to attend a memorial for his brother, and with the help of Irans Kurdish Democratic Party, he managed to escape to Iraq, and then Turkey, and make his way to the United States.Although Ms. Secor does not always manage to situate such stories within a larger, coherent narrative, her subjects experiences speak for themselves  and they provide sharp, pinhole windows into a country that for many years has seemed, in her words, like a black box whose contents were all but unknowable."}
{"text": "If your home team is playing in the Super Bowl (looking at you, Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers fans), the parties you attend could give you more than just heartburn, a hangover or temporary psychological discomfort.They could give you the flu.According to a new study published in the American Journal of Health Economics, the death rate from the flu is appreciably higher among those whose home team makes it to the Super Bowl.This seemingly puzzling finding actually makes some sense. The game occurs during the heart of flu season and is the reason for the mingling at Super Bowl parties. And fans with their team in the game are probably more likely to attend one.The flu virus can spread whenever a person with it releases droplets of saliva  by coughing, sneezing or even talking  within six feet of someone without it. At a Super Bowl party, people are mingling closely.The Super Bowl is far from the only event that increases flu transmission. Anything that puts more people in close contact during flu season does so. One study found that the reduction in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks postponed that years flu peak by almost two weeks. The holiday closure of schools in France reduces flu cases by about 17 percent, according to another study.Flu rates were higher at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002, large music festivals in Hungary and Belgium, and the Hajj pilgrimage. Its likely that other large gatherings during the flu season lead to greater transmission and mortality as well; they just havent been studied.But the Super Bowl provided a convenient natural experiment. The economists who worked on the study  Charles Stoecker and Alan Barreca, from Tulane, and Nicholas Sanders, from Cornell  compared deaths of people who lived near Super Bowl-participating teams with those who lived near other N.F.L. teams. Using mortality data from 1974 to 2009, the researchers found that areas that send teams to the Super Bowl experience an 18 percent increase in flu deaths in those years, relative to other years and areas with an N.F.L. team not in the Super Bowl.Across all ages, 5.6 people per million die from the flu, a rate that increases to about 6.6 in Super Bowl-contending areas. Flu deaths are concentrated among those 65 years and older  40.7 people per million die from the flu. In Super Bowl-contending areas, that figure jumps to 48.The flu also leads to doctor visits, hospitalizations and missed work and school. All told, the flus annual cost is about $100 billion nationally.The mortality impact is about seven times larger when the peak of the flu season occurs closer to the Super Bowl than when it is held about three weeks or more before or after the peak. During years of more virulent flu strains, mortality effects are stronger. Some N.F.L. teams regions are more prone to the flu and flu mortality than others, because of differences in weather and demographics, which can be statistically controlled.The researchers also found that flu mortality didnt increase in Super Bowl-contending areas a year or two before or after their teams went to the game. In other words, their results are not driven by generally higher flu mortality in some regions than others  its the Super Bowl that makes the difference.What can Super Bowl fans do to prevent the spread of the flu? Avoiding close contact with others who might be sick is an obvious way to reduce the chances of getting the flu. But for those who dont want to miss Super Bowl parties and other gatherings during flu season, you can take other steps to reduce the risk.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people get the flu vaccine; wash their hands frequently; avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth; and clean surfaces at home. Those hosting Super Bowl parties  whether in Denver and Charlotte, N.C., or elsewhere  might supplement the beer and snacks with some hand sanitizer, and suggest to guests that a dab with each score could be part of the celebration."}
{"text": "Seeking to show progress in New Yorks efforts to improve homeless shelters, Mayor Bill de Blasio released a new  and overdue  report on Monday that catalogs the number of safety violations at more than 600 sites used to house homeless people.The report, the Shelter Repair Scorecard, documents longstanding problems in cluster-site shelters, which are housing units rented as shelter space from private landlords.The 265 cluster shelters house about 20 percent of the citys 58,000 people in the shelter system, but those buildings accounted for 67 percent of the outstanding violations, or 14,418, as of the end of December.City officials announced a plan last month to stop using cluster shelters by the end of 2018.By contrast, the citys 357 traditional shelters, many of them operated by nonprofits under contract with the city, fared better in the scorecard. More than half of those shelters had 10 or fewer violations, and family shelters averaged less than one violation each, a level the city said was similar to a typical city apartment building.Six traditional shelters, including a city-owned center in Manhattan, had more than 100 open violations (as did 30 cluster shelter sites).The mayor promised last spring, after the citys Investigation Department released a report criticizing shelter conditions, that the report card would be out by last May. But it ended up taking months longer and what was released on Monday lacked some key data, including addresses or details of the violations.The scorecard also does not include reports of crime, which has proved as much of a concern to shelter residents as conditions. Many homeless people say they fear shelters because of thefts and other crimes.Last week, Mr. de Blasio announced that the city would increase security at 27 shelters, following the murder of Deven Black, a former public-school teacher, who the police say was killed by another shelter resident. The resident, Anthony White, 21, has a history of mental health issues, and he remained at large.Steven Banks, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, said that the scorecard provided a baseline of violations at the facilities, and that the public would be able to see if the city addresses those violations or if they increased over time.The violation totals for the cluster sites confirmed extensive problems in that part of the shelter system. The use of cluster sites began in 2000 as the city ran out of room in traditional shelters, but it has ballooned from 50 units to thousands of units, many in poor condition, and leased at rents that exceed market rates.Inspectors found a combined 445 open violations among 84 units at two Brooklyn buildings operated by the same landlord who has been cited in the past for the poor upkeep. The landlord did not return a call on Monday for comment.Its Exhibit A for why this 16-year-old program is being phased out, said Mr. Banks, who is heading an overhaul of the citys approach to homelessness.The release of the scorecard was coupled with the launch of a hotline for shelter residents to contact about problems in their buildings. We are distributing information to residents about their ability to call that hotline for help, Mr. Banks said.Shelter providers have long complained that the city does not pay them enough to care for their buildings. Mr. Banks said the city was addressing that with an increase in the maintenance and repair budget to $54 million, from $37 million, in the coming fiscal year.Christy Parque, executive director of Homeless Services United, which represents shelter providers, said in a statement that members were grateful for the citys financial commitment announced today to address the decades-old disinvestment in homeless shelters."}
{"text": "Read in English.El conflicto entre las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia y el estado ha durado ms de cinco dcadas.Ha sido uno de las guerras civiles ms largas de la historia. Y ha dejado como resultado cientos de miles de muertos, millones de desplazados, un costo de miles de millones de dlares, un pas dividido y una regin desestabilizada.Las negociaciones que comenzaron en La Habana en 2012 estn allanando el camino hacia el fin de la guerra. Hoy la paz es ms posible que nunca. El gobierno y las Farc ya han llegado a acuerdos preliminares sobre temas de fondo y han acordado un plazo para la firma del acuerdo final: el 23 de marzo.Desde que comenzaron las conversaciones de paz, Federico Ros Escobar, un fotgrafo colombiano de 35 aos ha viajado al interior del pas en varias ocasiones para pasar tiempo con los guerrilleros. Su objetivo, desmitificarlos. En sus propias palabras capturar la humanidad de los combatientes en los que podran ser sus ltimos das alzados en armas.Me parece que es importante que cuando llegue el momento de la firma final, cuando la guerrilla inicie su transicin, los colombianos sepan quines son los miembros de las Farc.Histricamente, el gobierno ha tratado de representar a los guerrilleros como asesinos sedientos de sangre y traficantes de drogas en busca de negocio y lucro.La guerrilla se ha definido a s misma como la defensora del pueblo y su conciencia, como guardianes de territorios y comunidades marginadas por la oligarqua.Han hecho cosas terribles. Han utilizado armas no convencionales, han asesinado, han secuestrado, han extorsionado, han dividido familias, dijo Ros por telfono.Pero aadi que las Farc tambin ha sido una influencia positiva en ciertas zonas olvidadas del pas. Llevaron maestros y construyeron escuelas, puestos de salud y otras obras pblicas.Estas fotos, tomadas en noviembre de 2014, tienen su propia historia. Ros vol a una zona lejana del departamento de Choc, en el litoral Pacfico de Colombia, y desde ah tom tres lanchas distintas hacia el interior de la selva. Camin. Y por fin lleg a un campamento guerrillero. Vivi una semana con el frente 57 de la Farc.Ros logr capturar el ritmo de la vida diaria de los guerrilleros. Literas de madera cubiertas por lonas camufladas, guardias alrededor del permetro de los campamentos, la hora de la cocina, la del bao en el ro, las caminatas a travs de la selva.La guerrilla no se queda mucho tiempo en el mismo lugar. Mueve sus campamentos cada par de das. Se lleva todo a cuestas.Las fotos muestran expresiones hoscas, cansadas. No hay espacio para la alegra. Como sucede con la mayora de fuerzas armadas, gran parte de su trabajo es rutinario y tedioso. Pero hay una imagen que revela un momento de diversin, de escape. Un guerrillero con un AK-47 en la espalda juega billar en un pueblo. Pero hasta a esa imagen le falta alegra, parece poco ms que un intento de matar el aburrimiento.No son una banda de G.I. Joes armados que se pasan todo el tiempo disparando, dice Ros.Durante sus das con las Farc, los acompa en reuniones con habitantes de dos comunidades en territorio bajo su control. Los campesinos estaban preocupados por lo que podra suceder cuando las Farc dejen las armas y se desmovilicen. Temen que los paramilitares quieran ajustar cuentas.Les pedan que no se desmovilizaran, que no siguieran adelante con el proceso de paz, que siguieran defendindolos, record Ros.Ros tambin sinti algo de incertidumbre entre las filas de las Farc. Cree que hay una sensacin de felicidad por los avances proceso de paz pero, al mismo tiempo, hay dudas sobre lo que va a pasar con sus vidas despus de las negociaciones.Cmo ser el proceso de desmovilizacin? Los insurgentes y sus familiares estarn protegidos de venganzas y guerra sucia? Cmo van a reintegrarse a la sociedad? Tendrn espacio en la poltica?Ros no tiene las respuestas. Pero dice que su trabajo muestra los ltimos das antes de un proceso totalmente diferente. De un gran cambio.Sigue a @federicorios, @KirkSemple y @nytimesphoto en Twitter.

{"text": "Junto a la entrada de La Monumental, la mayor plaza de toros del mundo, venden choripanes y suena en loop el segundo disco de los Hombres G. El de las chicas cocodrilo. Si muchos espaoles de mi generacin hemos entrado alguna vez en una plaza de toros, fue en los 80 para escuchar a los Hombres G, que lo eran todo entonces.La tarde del 31 de enero en Ciudad de Mxico, Jos Toms lo es todo. Una semana llevan repitiendo la monserga. Hay que ponerse en modo de vivir la historia para acercarse a la fiesta.A medioda sortean los toros que le tocan a cada matador. Los animales estn en un corral, esquinados, mansos, en exposicin. Un grupo de aficionados los supervisa. Pasan por un corredor sobre los animales. En mesnada y silencio: rpido, incmodos y apretados, para no asustar. Como cuando metas los dedos en el parteluz del prtico de la gloria en ao Xacobeo o te das de croques contra la piedra. Muy en orden y forma.Hay una fila para mujeres y otra para hombres. Es Ciudad de Mxico, 2016, pero no s si estoy en un mitin de Adolfo Surez en la vila de los 70, justo antes de que Espaa tuviera constitucin, o a la salida de misa de doce en el pueblo de mi abuela el da de la fiesta patronal, mujeres en las filas delanteras, hombres atrs.Se dejan ver, miran, estn. El mdico de la plaza; una seora con bolsa del congreso mexicano de tanatologa; el torero retirado con dos amigos a los lados y dos ms detrs, sonriendo, importantes; el anciano de bigotillo horizontal y recortado a la usted no sabe con quin est hablando; un poltico con guardaespaldas; y gente que dice esa es la gente de en referencia a los que acompaan a la estrella. Hay tanta clase en el ambiente, tanto pauelo a juego con la corbata y tanta patilla larga en hacha que, hasta para el lego, salta a la vista el saber estar del aficionado al toro.Esta temporada triunfa un modelo de chaleco en rombo acolchado unisex en verde o azul. Sombrero de ala ancha, gafas de piloto. Gel. Raya al lado. Pelo brillante y tan pegado que debe doler hasta pestaear. Camisa bien abierta, larga, por fuera, apretadita aunque deje micheln a los lados. Suele ser blanca. Cadena de oro gorda y paralela al cuello, alto y rgido. Remangados lo justo para mostrar el reloj.La bandera de Espaa por doquier, en esa actitud de cuando dices que eres espaol y te vienen con lo de que sus abuelos tambin, para reafirmar algo. Algunos y algunas con esa letra T bordada en dorado sobre la silueta de un toro, decorada con hojas de acanto. Otros, apenas nios, con el traje de lana muy de hijo de conde venido a pisar calle.El cuerpo me dice, pese a los titulares, que en todo esto no se trata de hacer historia sino de serlo. Los toros son historia. Blanco y negro puro. Los abrazos entre conocidos, muchos y muy ceremoniales. De palma bien abierta y un poco curvada. Que suene sobre el chaleco en rombo acolchado. La otra mano en la cintura, pero sin apretar. Muy de hombres. Venden puros. La publicidad ms grande de la plaza es de coac.La corrida es lo nico que he visto pasar a la hora prevista en Mxico. Salen dos hombres a caballo con plumas de colores en la cabeza y varias personas vestidas en rosa cabaret, dorado de retablo y azul Spider-Man. Brillan hasta la ltima fila del tendido barato.Para matar al primer toro, Bellotero, adems de Jos Toms y su espada hay dos caballos con lanzas y cinco hombres. Algunos con pinchos en las manos, las banderillas.Dos minutos despus de empezar, el toro trastabilla sobre las patas delanteras. A los seis, los cuernos se le clavan en la arena. A los ocho no tiene fuerzas ni para levantar la cabeza. Sangre y pasodoble metlico.A los 12 quien come polvo es Jos Toms. Se acerca tanto supongo que para darle un poco de lucimiento a la pelea, bastante desigual por otra parte que Bellotero le rompe hasta el pantaln. A los 15 la historia est comiendo arena de nuevo. Esta vez parece que el cuerno le pasa al lado de la cabeza. Solo de verlo, duele.Me explican los muletazos en redondel, que el torero se pega de manera temeraria al animal, que arquea el cuerpo cabeza atrs, testculos a centmetros del pitn. Que todo es muestra de valor.Jos Toms mueve la muleta muy cerca de los cuernos, el pobre Bellotero sigue como a espasmos y yo no puedo quitarme del recuerdo ese movimiento cansino de las cabezas de toro de salpicadero de la infancia (la versin espaola de los bubble heads de los camiones).A los 17 minutos de empezar, Jos Toms le mete una espada en el lomo a Bellotero y un minuto ms tarde uno de los refuerzos le clava un pincho grande en lo que equivaldra a la nuca. Estira las patas y cae de lado.A la historia le dan una oreja y la devuelve. La culpa es, dice el pblico, de la ganadera. Bellotero no se ha dejado matar bien. Para que la historia no se vaya con las manos vacas, Joselito Adame, un mexicano que no llega a los 30, le dedic el sexto toro. Servir de consolacin que alguien mate por ti?Jos Toms no se ha gustado ni a s mismo y yo me lo habra pasado mejor escuchando a los Hombres G."}
{"text": "Bernie Sanders is right: The Iowa Democratic caucuses were a virtual tie, especially after you consider that the results arent even actual vote tallies, but state delegate equivalents subject to all kinds of messy rounding rules and potential geographic biases.The official tally, for now, is Hillary Clinton at 49.9 percent, and Mr. Sanders at 49.6 percent with 97 percent of precincts reporting early Tuesday morning.But in the end, a virtual tie in Iowa is an acceptable, if not ideal, result for Mrs. Clinton and an ominous one for Mr. Sanders. He failed to win a state tailor made to his strengths.He fares best among white voters. The electorate was 91 percent white, per the entrance polls. He does well with less affluent voters. The caucus electorate was far less affluent than the national primary electorate in 2008. Hes heavily dependent on turnout from young voters, and he had months to build a robust field operation. As the primaries quickly unfold, he wont have that luxury.Iowa is not just a white state, but also a relatively liberal one  one of only a few of the states where Barack Obama won white voters in the 2008 primary and in both general elections. It is also a caucus state, which tends to attract committed activists.In the end, Mr. Sanders made good on all of those strengths. He excelled in college towns. According to the entrance polls, he won an astonishing 84 percent of those 17 to 29 (17-year-olds can caucus in Iowa if theyre 18 by the general election)  even better than Mr. Obama in the 2008 caucus. He won voters making less than $50,000 a year, again outperforming Mr. Obama by a wide margin. He won very liberal voters comfortably, 58 to 39 percent.But these strengths were neatly canceled by Mrs. Clintons strengths. She won older voters, more affluent voters, along with somewhat liberal and moderate Democrats.This raises a straightforward challenge for Mr. Sanders. He has nearly no chance to do as well among nonwhite voters as Mr. Obama did in 2008. To win, Mr. Sanders will need to secure white voters by at least a modest margin and probably a large one. In the end, Mr. Sanders failed to score a clear win in a state where Mr. Obama easily defeated Mrs. Clinton among white voters.Mr. Sanderss strength wasnt so great as to suggest that hes positioned to improve upon national polls once the campaign heats up. National polls show him roughly tied with Mrs. Clinton among white voters, and it was the case here as well. It suggests that additional gains for Mr. Sanders in national polls will require him to do better than he did in Iowa, not that the close race in Iowa augurs a close one nationally.Mr. Sanders will have another opportunity to gain momentum after the New Hampshire primary. He might not get as much credit for a victory there as he would have in Iowa, since New Hampshire borders his home state of Vermont. But it could nonetheless give him another opportunity to overcome his weaknesses among nonwhite voters.As a general rule, though, momentum is overrated in primary politics. In 2008, for instance, momentum never really changed the contours of the race. Mr. Obamas victory in Iowa allowed him to make huge gains among black voters, but not much more  the sort of exception that would seem to prove the rule. Mr. Obama couldnt even put Mrs. Clinton away after winning a string of states in early February.Theres an even longer list of candidates with fairly limited appeal, particularly Republicans like Rick Santorum, Pat Buchanan or Mike Huckabee, who failed to turn early-state victories into broader coalitions.The polls this year offer additional reasons to doubt it. Mrs. Clinton holds more than 50 percent of the vote in national surveys; her share of the vote never declined in 2008. The polls say that her supporters are more likely to be firmly decided than Mr. Sanderss voters.Back-to-back wins in Iowa and New Hampshire by Mr. Sanders might have been enough to overcome that history. The no-decision in Iowa ensures we wont find out."}
{"text": "BURNS, Ore.   Local residents furious about the \narmed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge \n in eastern Oregon\n faced off in force on Monday against antigovernment protesters who support the occupation, with both sides gathering outside the Harney County Courthouse here in a nonviolent but dramatic confrontation.With several hundred people screaming at one another, sometimes only inches apart, it was a fierce and visceral display of the emotions raised by the takeover, which began on Jan. 2.As recently as this weekend, only one demonstration had been expected: Professed patriot groups had issued a call for militia members and others who support the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to come here and make their voices heard.They had planned to protest and denounce the arrest last week of the occupations leader, Ammon Bundy, and the death of LaVoy Finicum, one of the groups most visible members, who was shot by Oregon State Police troopers after a car chase. Eleven people have been arrested in connection with the takeover, and four people are still refusing to leave the refuge, about 30 miles outside town.In a surprisingly vocal counterprotest, local residents arrived at the Harney County courthouse first on Monday, and in what seemed to be larger numbers. They shouted, Go home! Go home! at the occupation supporters across the sidewalk  many of whom were visibly armed and carried American flags.The supporters, most of them from out of state, shouted back that freedom for all Americans was under threat no matter where you lived, and that patriotism was on their side. Where are your flags? they shouted. Where are your flags?County officials, including Sheriff Dave Ward, watched the spectacle from a second-story window in the courthouse.One of the occupation supporters was Billy Hennessey, a car salesman who drove three hours from Boise, Idaho, to protest Mr. Finicums death. People shouldnt die for expressing a different opinion, he said. He carried a sign saying, For the love of God, free the people.Caryn Burri, a Burns resident who wants the town to return to normal, said she was there to urge the F.B.I. to go home, and the only way for that to happen, she said, was for the armed outsiders to go home first.If they leave, the F.B.I. can leave, she said.As the demonstrations went on, there were scenes of high tension, with police officers sometimes physically separating people, but also attempts at conversion, as when Grant Gunderson, 67, a retired wildlife biologist who lives in Burns, tried to convince a neighbor that he was on the wrong side of the demonstration.We dont need them here, Mr. Gunderson said, gesturing to the Bundy/Finicum supporters. The two men hugged, but the argument was not won.The neighbor went back to the other side of the divide, saying, Theyre for freedom."}
{"text": "SO PAULO, Brazil   In this countrys top soccer league, the Brasileiro, team officials are used to the phone calls. They expect them. Agents and executives, middlemen and managers, all of them looking to make a deal in the games greatest shopping mall.But where once the interest regularly came from Madrid or Milan, these days the voice on the other end of the line, teams say, is more likely to be calling from Beijing or Shanghai. And increasingly, the Chinese suitors are looking to buy only the best.Last year, teams from Chinas Super League bought the rights to perhaps the Brasileiros two best players. Last month, Chinese clubs plucked four key players from the reigning champion, Corinthians, and a top striker from So Paulo.Brazil needs to learn to live with this, said Thiago Scuro, the sporting director of Cruzeiro, which won the Brazilian championship in 2013 and 2014. We were always a target, but whats changed is the big clubs in Europe are taking very young players, to have time to develop them there. But China is signing the star players in their 20s.We cannot fight this, as its economics, not football.Brazil has always been a net exporter of soccer talent; no country sends more professional players abroad. But Brazils slumping economy and the chronic financial problems plaguing domestic clubs  it is not uncommon for players to go unpaid for months  have some regarding Chinas current shopping spree as a worrisome asset-stripping of the Brazilian game.The tale of Corinthians is the latest example. Corinthians dominated last season, finishing first by 12 points, and the feeling was a South American title and a return to a World Club Cup was a possibility this year. But that was before the team lost eight players.The four highest transfer fees came from China, for a combined $24.5 million. Renato Augusto and Ralf moved to Beijing Guoan; center back Gil (who is making inroads into the national team) joined Shandong Luneng Taishan; and midfielder Jdson headed to the second-division team Tianjin Quanjian. (Tianjin also snapped up 23-year-old Santos star Geuvnio for $12 million.)Its not a surprise to lose players when you are champions, but the big surprise was they went to China, said Edu, who starred in Europe with Arsenal and Valencia during his playing days and is now Corinthians sporting director. Its not so frustrating. Its the market. You just have to replace them.Yet Chinese soccers taste for Brazilians shows no sign of slowing. Last week, Chelsea accepted a $35 million offer for the Brazilian midfielder Ramires from Jiangsu Suning, which had earlier made a failed bid for the Milan striker Luiz Adriano. Moves like those, and the bulk acquisitions of younger players from Brazilian clubs, have soccer officials here concerned about what the money-driven deals could one day mean for the future of Brazils national team. Ramires, 28, was a starter at the last World Cup, and while he had fallen out of favor recently, exports like Gil, 28, and Augusto, 27, were thought by some to be part of the national teams future after their recent resurgence at Corinthians.With the crisis here, the prices they are offering, we cant compete with that, Edu said of the recent sales. But in terms of a players career, they are going for money, not the status, and for me, that would have made me think twice, as it could get in the way of playing for Brazil.Chinese clubs might not release players for national team play except in the mandatory official windows, Edu said, adding: Its a personal decision, but you need to balance it. And if youre good enough and have the chance to play for Brazil, nothing should get in the way.In one sense, the China conundrum is nothing new. But the earlier Brazilian star Jnior Baiano was already 31 when he went to Shanghai in 2001, and of the 134 reported moves of Brazilians to China from 2003 to 2010, almost all were players from minor clubs.But last year the Brasileiros two best players  both of them having broken into the national team  made the switch. One, Diego Tardelli, had just won the Brazilian Cup with Atltico Mineiro. The other, Ricardo Goulart, had just won back-to back league championships with Cruzeiro. And the money is only getting better: The onetime Sevilla striker Lus Fabiano left So Paulo for China last month for a reported $7 million a year.Guangzhou Evergrande could be described as the team that changed the market in 2011, when it signed the Argentine midfielder Daro Conca from the Rio de Janeiro club Fluminense and made him, at the time, the third-highest-paid player in the world behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.Guangzhous investments quickly paid off: It has won five straight Chinese Super League titles, and its average attendance is nearly 46,000 a game. Last summer, the team hired Brazils former World Cup manager Luiz Felipe Scolari; he quickly delivered Guangzhous second Asian Champions League title in three years.From originally being a real estate company, their owners saw what football could achieve in terms of strengthening their brand, and theyve now gone into other areas like entertainment and bottled water and cooking oil, Christopher Atkins, a player agent in China, said. Other clubs have seen, too, the political and marketing gains that can be made by representing a certain city or province with a successful team. People talked about China next up being a steppingstone league, but theyve just skipped that phase.From the Chinese end, the equation is simple. Merely being associated with Brazilian soccer buys a superficial legitimacy as China ponders making a bid to host the World Cup. For Brazilian pros, its more complicated. Off the record, some players talked about safety as a factor in their decision to entertain offers from China; research released last month showed 21 of the worlds 50 most dangerous cities were in Brazil. And the pull is not simply huge contracts, but clubs that actually honor them.Brazil is struggling as a country, said Ricardo Mello, who works as an intermediary between Brazilian players and Chinese clubs. As the Brazilian real has plummeted in value, he said, the ability to be paid in foreign currency means a lot to players; it can change lives forever.And for Brazilian teams, transfer fees remain a vital source of revenue. A list of the most indebted clubs in the country has 10 owing at least $63 million, with Flamengo topping the list at more than $150 million. Despite its size and recent successes, Corinthians sits uncomfortably on that list, with debts of around $70 million.While some wonder why European teams are not racing to match Chinas spending in the market, the simple answer seems to be that they do not value the players as highly. Thus, in Brazil, where once there was pride in selling brilliant artists to those who appreciated them, now there is little joy in selling off lesser players at inflated prices.The model here is long broken, said Amir Somoggi, a sports marketing consultant based here. We work on popular governance of teams, not investing into them as companies. And our philosophy is sell, sell, sell."}
{"text": "In the pages of T last September, the critic and novelist Edmund White asked, Why cant we stop talking about New York in the late 1970s? This month, Paul Kasmin and Pace/MacGill galleries have teamed up to present an exhibition of two dozen photos from one of that periods most celebrated photographers, the late Peter Hujar, whose archive also supplied the imagery for Whites piece. The show includes some of his most iconic images, including Candy Darling on Her Deathbed, here, and the portraits of Susan Sontag and Fran Lebowitz below that were also included alongside Whites article in T.The title of the exhibition, Lost Downtown, comes from the director of Hujars archive, Stephen Koch, who assisted the galleries in winnowing the selection of images down from an initial edit of about 100. Peters work really is about an era in New York City life thats vanished, and I thought it would be interesting to underline that, Koch says. Its saying that there was what used to be called a bohemian downtown, which was in certain ways being ignored  wasnt part of big, fancy New York at all. But nonetheless, it was a very vital and creative time, and a lot of whats going on has survived. Its become a kind of myth.When it comes to this exhibition and others like it, Koch ventures, the primary audience isnt his or Hujars contemporaries, but rather a younger generation keen to access the artifacts of that time. The strong majority of people coming through were toddlers when Peter died, in 1987, Koch says. Theres a kind of paradise-lost feeling to it, which I think is very significant. (For evidence of just how far gone that paradise is, Koch cites the spacious loft where Hujar worked: It was illegal, but it was $250 a month! Thats what he paid!)Of course, there were many people taking photos in New York in the 70s and 80s; the persistent resonance of Hujars work is unique. They are aesthetically elegant, even situated within the narrative of a gritty downtown. I think that he brought absolutely classic artistic values into the underworld of New York. Those pictures are beautifully composed. Theyre as beautifully composed as any Renaissance painting, and theyre absolutely strict, Koch says, adding that Hujar was enormously selective about his work and ended up satisfied with maybe one in 100 of his own photos. Of course, I am prejudiced, but I find the work looks better and better with time. It ages very well."}
{"text": "Anna Laerkesen, a leading ballerina in the Royal Danish Ballet who, breaking a traditional mold, won international acclaim for her poetic originality as a dancer in the 1960s and later as a choreographer, died on Jan. 14 in Copenhagen. She was 73.Her death was reported by the Danish newspapers Politiken and Berlingske, which did not specify a cause.When Ms. Laerkesen joined the Royal Danish Ballet at 17, virtually all its members trained at the companys school. Ms. Laerkesen, however, studied with Edite Frandsen, a private teacher in Copenhagen, before spending a year at the Royal Danish Ballet school in 1959.The same year she joined the company as an apprentice, cast in a supporting role in the signature Royal Danish ballet La Sylphide, by the 19th-century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. Shortly afterward, when she had a huge success in the title role of the elusive sylph, it was clear she had brought out something stunningly new.It was a lyrical mystery that we had not seen before in La Sylphide  very far from the usual Bournonville, the Danish critic Erik Aschengreen said by telephone from Copenhagen on Sunday.This deep, poetic quality was also identified with her performances in Antony Tudors Lilac Garden and in Swan Lake, for which she traveled to Moscow to be coached by the Soviet ballerina Galina Ulanova.Most of her dancing has an interior monologue about it, Clive Barnes wrote admiringly in The New York Times in 1971, when she appeared in plotless ballets by the American choreographer Eliot Feld as a guest with his company in New York.Anna Laerkesen was born in Copenhagen on March 2, 1942. She was promoted to principal dancer (called solo dancer in the Royal Danish Ballet) in 1964 and received ballerina status in 1966 with the rarely given higher title of first solo dancer.Although she excelled in her own way in the companys traditional Bournonville ballets, she also danced in the troupes wide repertoire of works by George Balanchine, Kenneth MacMillan, Birgit Cullberg, Flemming Flindt and others, including Frederick Ashtons Romeo and Juliet, to which she brought a carefree sensuality.Over the years, her partners in La Sylphide included Erik Bruhn, Peter Martins and Rudolf Nureyev.The Danish critic Ebbe Mork once commented that Ms. Laerkesens dancing combined  a sense of psychology with her personal way of phrasing music.These qualities of linking emotion with an atypical approach to music were apparent when she turned to choreographing in Denmark and abroad in 1988, four years after retiring from the Royal Danish Ballet as a dancer.Invited by Mr. Martins to New York City Ballets 1994 Diamond Project, a showcase for new works, Ms. Laerkesen choreographed In the Blue, a plotless neoclassical ballet set to Brahmss Violin Concerto. Full of refreshing idiosyncrasy, it brought out passionate dancing in a young Wendy Whelan and an unleashed bravura in Nikolaj Hbbe (now director of the Royal Danish Ballet). Unusually, the ensemble remained still during a violin solo.There was no immediate word on her survivors."}
{"text": "Campaign aides for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said Monday night that the Democratic Party did not collect the results of 90 Iowa precincts, which is about 5 percent of all votes cast in the state, because the party had failed to properly staff the precincts.Rania Batrice, a spokeswoman for the campaign based in Iowa, said that the party reached out to the campaigns of Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and asked them to help tally the results. Its just offensive that they dropped the ball like this, she said. Its ridiculous.Monday night it was unclear how the issue would be resolved.Ms. Batrice said the party was supposed to properly staff all precincts with caucus chairs but that some of those people responsible for calculating the results did not shown up.The Democratic Party pushed back against reports that the caucus sites were not staffed appropriately.We are currently getting results from our small number of outstanding precincts, and results continue to be reported on our public website, the party said in statement. These outstanding precincts have chairs who we are in the process of contacting to get their results. It is inaccurate to report that these precincts did not have chairs.The party said that it was seeking help from the campaigns in contacting their precinct chairs."}
{"text": "LONG after the dust settles in Iowa  and New Hampshire, and even the 2016 campaign itself  one question will remain: Why, after decades of supporting the liberal and conservative establishments, did the white middle-class abandon them? Wherever Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders end up, their candidacies represent a major shift in American politics. Since World War II our political culture has been organized around the needs, fears and aspirations of white middle-class voters in ways that also satisfied the interests of the rich and powerful. Thats no longer true.As we know, the rich are now quite a bit richer. In itself, this need not disrupt the old political consensus. More decisive is the fact that the white middle class is in decline, both economically and culturally.This story of decline is often told in racial and ethnic terms: White America is being displaced by a multicultural America, and especially on the right, voters are retreating to racist posturing. There may be some truth to this story, but for the most part its a huge distraction.In fact, the real cleavage is not interracial, but intra-racial: The populism were seeing stems entirely from the collision of whites who flourish in the global economy  and amid the cultural changes of the last 50 years  with those who dont.And while weve heard a lot about the economic decline of the middle class, the cultural decline of the white middle class isnt discussed nearly as often. It should be.First, there are the consequences of the great success of the upper middle class, which today lives in a separate world of well-manicured neighborhoods with good schools, intact families and cultural confidence. We compliment ourselves that a generally meritocratic system is open to far more people than was true 50 years ago. And it has been  but the resulting culture of ambition paradoxically erodes middle-class confidence. Today, the vast middle of the middle fears that unless youre on the way up, youre on the way down.And its not just competitiveness that is eroding the white middle class. When I was coming of age in the 1970s, drug use was already undermining the white middle class. Since then marriage rates among high school-educated whites have declined and illegitimacy has increased. A priest I know serves three small-town parishes in rural, white Pennsylvania. I asked about his pastoral challenges. The biggest: Grandparents parenting their grandchildren, as their own children are too messed up to raise them.Cultural instability compounds economic instability. A person near the median in our society is on shaky ground. He feels that what was once reliable is now eroding. This is as much a source of todays middle-class anxiety as stagnant household incomes.Whats striking  and crucial for understanding our populist moment  is the fact that the leadership cadres of both parties arent just unresponsive to this anxiety. They add to it.The intelligentsia on the left rarely lets a moment pass without reminding us of the demographic eclipse of white middle-class voters. Sometimes, those voters are described as racists, or derided as dull suburbanites who lack the lan of the new urban creative class. The message: White middle-class Americans arent just irrelevant to Americas future, theyre in the way.Conservatives are no less harsh. Pundits ominously predict that the innovators are about to be overwhelmed by a locust blight of takers. The message: If it werent for successful people like us, middle-class people like you would be doomed. And if youre not an entrepreneurial producer, youre in the way.Is it any surprise that white middle-class voters are in rebellion?Democratic and Republican Party establishments appeal to the interests of these voters, promising to protect them (Democrats) or spur growth that will renew economic opportunity (Republicans). But these appeals miss the point.Our political history since the end of World War II has turned on the willingness of white middle-class voters to rally behind great causes in league with the wealthy and political elite: Resist Communism! Send a man to the moon! Overcome racism! Protect the environment! Today, white middle-class voters want to be reassured that they can play an active role in politics. They want someone to appeal to their sense of political self-worth, not just their interests.This is precisely what Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders offer. Mr. Trump speaks about restoring American greatness, rhetorical gestures akin to Barack Obamas vague 2008 slogan, Yes, we can. We can mock both as empty. But voters who feel disempowered and marginalized latch on to this promise. They want to be partners with the rich and powerful in defining our future as a country, not recipients of their benevolent ministrations, which explains why theyre untroubled by Mr. Trumps great wealth.Mr. Sanders also appeals to the strong desire that the white middle class has to recover its central role in the national project. While he attracts support from a wealthier stratum of the middle class than Mr. Trump, the appeal is the same. He asks them to join him in fundamentally remaking our political economy. We can dismiss his socialism as an unworkable throwback, but hes doing something our political establishment cant or wont: asking middle-class voters to undertake a nation-defining transformation.If these candidates have traction, its because over the last two decades our political elites, themselves almost entirely white, have decided, for different reasons, that the white middle class has no role to play in the multicultural, globalized future they envision, a future that they believe they will run. This primary season will show us whether or not theyre right."}
{"text": "A listing, out-of-control cargo ship on a collision course with the French coast has been rotated away from danger, French maritime officials said on Monday.The ship, the Modern Express, had been adrift in the Bay of Biscay between Spain and France since early last week, when it began tilting severely to its starboard side, prompting an aerial rescue of its 22 crew members.Since then, rough seas have thwarted attempts to attach a towline to the vessel  a Panamanian-flagged ship  that could be used to steer it back out to sea. On Friday, specialists succeeded in attaching a line, only to see it snap when powerful waves applied too much strain.With the vessel less than 30 miles from the coast on Monday, a window of milder weather presented officials with a last chance to take action before an expected collision by Tuesday.In a bold operation, a four-person team from a Dutch maritime services company were lowered from a helicopter onto the vessel, tilted at about 40 degrees, and they again attached a towline. French officials said a tugboat was then able to yank the ship away from danger.Now, they said, they were keeping an eye on the line and the ship, hoping it would hold as they sought to create distance from the coast. Officials will then look for a safe harbor.The Modern Express had been traveling from Gabon to the French port of Le Havre, carrying timber and equipment, when it ran into trouble and issued a distress call last Tuesday.If the operation on Monday had failed, the ship had been expected to run aground in the Landes region by Tuesday night."}
{"text": "Mauro Bigonzetti, an Italian choreographer with a substantial reputation in Europe and the United States, has been appointed director of La Scala Ballet, the company announced on Monday. He succeeds Makhar Vaziev, who will become the director of the Bolshoi Ballet on March 18.During his eight-year tenure at La Scala, Mr. Vaziev raised the technical level and profile of the company, and broadened its range by commissioning work from Alexei Ratmansky, Martha Clarke and Mr. Bigonzetti, among others. The choice of Mr. Bigonzetti, 55, who works in a contemporary ballet idiom, over other contenders like the La Scala principal dancer Roberto Bolle or the former Paris Opera Ballet toile, Laurent Hilaire, is nonetheless a surprise, since La Scala Ballet has long maintained a largely traditional classical repertory. In a news release, La Scala described Mr. Bigonzetti as the major Italian choreographer of our time, and an artist with a solid classical formation.Mr. Bigonzetti began his career as a dancer with the Rome Opera Ballet, but soon left to join Aterballetto, a small, contemporary ballet troupe, for which he created his first works, and which he went on to direct from 1997 through 2008. He has since worked as a freelance choreographer with numerous companies, including the Stuttgart Ballet, English National Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and New York City Ballet, for which he has choreographed four ballets.Rumors of Mr. Bigonzettis appointment surfaced on Jan. 27, when the Italian daily La Repubblica published a report of the decision before it was made official by La Scala. In a blog post quoting the article, some dancers are cited as opposing the decision, telling the reporter Teresa Monestiroli that they believe that it would be suitable to appoint a person who has more classical background, together with an experience managing a large company such as that of La Scala."}
{"text": "Once mostly anonymous, the producers who oversee top television series have sometimes become as well known as the actors who star in them. On occasion, The New York Times will pose questions from readers (and some of our own) to notable show runners and post their responses.Coming soon: Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould of Better Call Saul.This week, Nahnatchka Khan discusses her ABC sitcom, Fresh Off the Boat. When the series debuted on ABC last February, it was TVs first Asian-American family comedy since Margaret Chos All-American Girl in 1994 and 1995. Now, as Hollywood contends with its embarrassingly monochromatic slate of Oscar acting nominees, Fresh Off the Boat is part of a growing list of sitcoms with ethnic minorities in leading roles. This also includes ABCs black-ish and Dr. Ken, NBCs Superstore and Telenovela, and Netflixs Master of None.It feels like TV is leading the way, Ms. Khan said. The floodgates opened up, and people are seeing themselves represented more on television. On Tuesday Fresh Off the Boat  based on Eddie Huangs memoir about growing up Taiwanese-American in Florida during the 90s  will become the first American TV series to do an episode focused on the Chinese New Year holiday. In honor of the occasion, Ms. Khan recently fielded questions about the shows cast, its hip-hop theme song and her previous work on the cult-favorite sitcom Dont Trust the B---- in Apartment 23. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Q. Why did you initially want to tell Eddie Huangs story?A. I loved being able to talk about the first-generation experience. I really related to the experiences Eddie wrote about: having parents who are immigrants but being born here with siblings, and being that bridge between the old and the new schools. Id never seen a family sitcom deal with that.Why did you decide to do a Chinese New Years episode?When we got the Season 2 order, it initially was for 13 episodes. We didnt know if wed get a full order, with the back nine. We knew Episode 13 was going to end up around Chinese New Year, so weve always had that earmarked. Even if we dont do any more, we definitely want to hit that, because its such an important holiday for so many people. The fact that it hasnt been represented at all makes it such a great opportunity for our show. Hopefully, this will become part of our shows canon; every year, well do our Chinese New Year episode.How familiar were you with the holidays traditions?The writer of the episode, Sheng Wang, is Taiwanese-American, and he grew up in Houston around the same time that the show is set, so a lot of his experiences were like this. We have Korean writers, Chinese writers, Indian writers, and Im Persian. Some of us would go to school and explain about our New Years and get made fun of by our classmates. What are you talking about? New Years is in January. It was unexpectedly emotional for people to talk about that. Hopefully, after this episode airs, more kids on the playground will know what this is. Thats kind of a cool thing.Do you feel  less like an outsider since youve been able to share Fresh Off the Boat on such a large platform and  to see how many people can relate, no matter their backgrounds?  Anisha Adusumilli, Los AngelesI feel really satisfied that so many people can relate to it. I dont think Ill ever stop feeling like somewhat of an outsider, because my experience is not the majoritys. Being a woman, Persian and gay, I become more and more of an outsider with every click of the microscope. But whats fun for me is to take the way Ive seen the world and have it inform the way I write the characters. It feels different to me than maybe the way a white guy experiences the world through his prism.It seems many controversial topics are brought up through a comedic portrayal of cultural stereotypes in order to appeal to a wider audience who may think they are laughing with characters about culture clashes but may really be laughing at them based on their own prejudices. Do you think new avenues for TV, like Netflix and Amazon, will allow for a deeper, more honest look into these topics?  Scott Yeilding, Beverly Hills, Calif.Because of successes like Fresh Off the Boat, Dr. Ken, Master of None and The Mindy Project, there will be more shows like these, and then you can get more nuanced with what you talk about. As far as dealing in stereotypes, you cant control viewers or know what their inner thoughts or beliefs are, but we are always telling stories from the inside out. The family is not the butt of the jokes. Theyre not the ones in the fishbowl being pointed at. We see the world through their eyes. They control the narrative. That is kind of revolutionary.Why is the part of Louis Huang played by a Korean actor? Were you unable to find any capable English-speaking Taiwanese actors to portray the part of an English-speaking Taiwanese character?  Katie C., New YorkRandall Park is one of the funniest comedic actors working today, regardless of race. I obsessively watched Veep for his performance. Randall understands this character, and he knows how to be funny, emotional and real, and how to carry story weight. Hes like a utility knife. He can bring it all. Im so grateful and lucky that hes part of this show because of his skills.Constance Wu is such a powerhouse, yet she hadnt done much comedy before you cast her. Did you see this kind of potential in her?I remember seeing her picture, and she looked so young. Shes got to be the mother of three boys, and I thought, Im never going to buy it. She came in, and from the first second she opened her mouth as Jessica, she nailed it. She inhabited that character. The choices she makes are so unusual, and she elevates everything. She makes it so much funnier than you thought it ever could be.How do you balance the specificity of the experience of growing up Chinese- American with the constraints of a sitcom? And not being Chinese-American yourself, how do you incorporate and maintain the Chinese-American experience and perspective in a non-stereotypical way?  Caroline, Washington, D.C.Luckily, we have a lot of Chinese-Americans on staff, from executive producers to writers to cast members. We always try to make sure the show has an authenticity and a specificity, because we want it to feel like these are real people. This is just one family. Theyre not going to represent everyones experience ever, but we really spend time making sure we get these characters correct.I was really glad that the Good Morning Orlando episode dealt with the Long Duk Dong issue from Sixteen Candles as well as paying tribute to Margaret Chos All-American Girl. Will there be any more episodes that shine a light on other Asian-Americans?  Kenix, Calif.We have an episode coming up in a few weeks called Michael Chang Fever. Its 1996 on the show, and that was around the time he made it to the finals of the Australian Open against Boris Becker. Its a huge deal in the Huang household. Louis is an enormous fan. He gets headbands made as a member of the Chang gang. Thats a really fun episode, and Billie Jean King plays herself in it. Shes amazing.Could you please replace the opening theme song? I think the show itself is cute, but I have reflexively changed the channel on more than one occasion because the song is so unpleasant.  Matt Lemmons, Jonesboro, Ark.Oh, no, I love the song! It makes me so happy. It doesnt sound like any other theme song on TV. Some people said, Its a little loud, and I said, Thats exactly right. We have to announce ourselves. We need to make a little noise.Would you ever consider reviving Dont Trust the B----  in Apartment 23 and pitching it to Netflix? There is a rumor about a Christmas special. Is that something we can look forward to?  Jorge, ArizonaAbsolutely. I love that show so much. Were talking about possibly doing some sort of Christmas special. Theres been a lot of interest in it. We felt like we didnt have enough time with that show. We only got to do 26 episodes, and there are so many more stories we want to tell. Id love to do it.What advice would you give to female writers of ethnic minorities early in their careers?  Chantal, MontrealAlways try to stay yourself. When you start out as a TV writer, you get a lot of pressure from outside forces to fit into what they think people want. Writing in another persons voice is a skill you have to develop when youre working on someone elses show. But if you can maintain your perspective, thats what will make you stand out. And as you move up, that will serve you more and more.What kept you going early on?Just paying the bills. I never had a backup plan. Ive only been good at one thing. I admire people who are jacks-of-all-trades. Thats not me. Ive always been passionate about movies, TV and writing, and Ive been working so hard at it for so long. There were lots of setbacks, but I loved it so much, there was no alternative. I just picked myself up and kept going."}

For the first time, a flexible, wearable sensor can collect data about multiple chemicals in body sweat.The device could help people monitor conditions like dehydration and fatigue in real time, said Ali Javey, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the inventors.The sensor could provide an alarm, for instance, that alerts a patient to drink a glass of water or take some medication. Dr. Javey and his colleagues described their system in the journal Nature.Lots of studies have shown how and why sweat composition changes, but it was very difficult before to measure this on patients, he said. The beauty of this is that it is a comfortable and easy-to-wear system.Other researchers have been developing sensors for sweat, but this is the first one that breaks down and analyzes multiple chemicals in sweat at a molecular level and transmits measurements in real time, Dr. Javey added.He and his colleagues, using flexible plastic substrates, made the prototype from a flexible electronics board and managed to collect information about glucose, lactate, sodium and potassium levels as well as body temperature from test subjects.The sensor transmits the data to a smartphone in real time. The researchers have filed a patent application for the technology.We only looked at four different chemicals, but sweat contains much more useful information that tells about whats happening to the body, Dr. Javey said."}

The tree also crushed three parked cars.The San Diego-Union Tribunes website identified the woman killed as Nicki Carano, 48, a musician, who was on her way to perform with her band, according to family and friends. The tree that killed her was a conifer, and it was about six feet in diameter, the website said.Capt. Joe Amador of the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department noted the accidents grim precision. Even five seconds one way or the other and this wouldnt have happened, he told The San Diego Union-Tribune. He added, Were in the lifesaving business and its hard when it doesnt turn out that way.Utility companies reported that more than 100,000 customers lost power on Sunday in San Diego and Los Angeles Counties at the height of the storm, which originated in the western Pacific. Southern California Edison said it had dispatched about 200 crew members to repair the damage.San Diego generally received a total of less than an inch of rain, said Stephen Harrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, but areas at higher elevations saw significantly more  five inches fell in the San Bernardino Mountains.Reports were still coming on snow totals, but meteorologists expected them to be substantial. Big Bear reported about seven inches by Monday morning, Mr. Harrison said.Golfers competing on the final day of the Farmers Insurance Open at San Diegos Torrey Pines on Sunday tried to brave the trajectory-curving winds and rains, but had to relent by the afternoon.

Plant, the former chief executive of TRW Automotive; and Sean O. Mahoney, a former investment banker who is a director of the car-parts maker Delphi Automotive and of Formula One Holdings.The settlement comes as the aluminum stalwart prepares to divide itself in two, cleaving its commodity side from its metal products business. Elliott, one of the busiest activist investors on Wall Street, emerged as a potential spoiler, disclosing what has become a 7.5 percent stake in the company.Mondays settlement reflects the trend of activists appearing in companies investor roll  and not picking a public fight, but instead working behind the scenes for changes and board seats. Such funds, previously known as noisy brawlers, have increasingly preferred to cast themselves as constructive agents of change.As part of Mondays settlement, Elliott agreed to back Alcoas entire slate of directors at the companys annual meeting.Each of our new directors is a high-caliber executive with a proven track record of success, and each brings valuable skills highly relevant to the markets we serve, including aerospace and automotive, Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoas chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. We look forward to drawing on their expertise as we launch two independent companies positioned for success.Dave Miller, a senior portfolio manager at Elliott, added, This is a pivotal moment for Alcoa and represents an opportunity to create substantial value for shareholders."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Factory activity in the worlds two biggest economies  the United States and China  slowed in January, a discouraging trend for the global economy.A separate report indicated a little more optimism on construction while another measure showed that consumers in the United States kept their spending flat in December.Manufacturing in the United States shrank in January for a fourth straight month as a strong dollar and weak demand overseas pinched American factories, the Institute for Supply Management said on Monday.The I.S.M.s manufacturing index ticked up to 48.2 from a revised 48 in December, but any reading below 50 signals a contraction. The index has remained below 50 since September.Factory exports and employment fell in January, though new orders and production grew for the first time since October.In China, an official survey found that manufacturing fell to its lowest level in more than three years. The index, based on a survey of Chinese factory purchasing managers, slipped to 49.4 from 49.7 in December. The January reading was the lowest since August 2012.Prospects for the global economy have been dimmed by Chinas sharp deceleration, which has, in turn, hurt emerging economies that have supplied China with materials.Bradley Holcomb, chairman of the I.S.M. survey committee, said manufacturing in the United States would most likely remain weak in coming months, slowed by the strong dollar and excess stockpiles of raw materials held by many companies. That means they will probably order fewer goods as they reduce those stockpiles.For now, its more of the same, Mr. Holcomb said. New orders are a bright spot here, and well hope that continues.A report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed that \nconstruction spending increased 0.1 percent in December after falling in October and November.The increase was driven by gains in home construction and spending on government projects. Those advances offset declines in spending on private construction of shopping centers, office buildings and hotels.For all of 2015, construction jumped 10.5 percent to $1.1 trillion, the highest total since 2007.Consumers, however, kept their spending flat in December and instead increased their savings rate to the highest level in three years. The spending figure was unchanged in December after rising 0.5 percent in November, while incomes increased 0.3 percent, according to a report on Monday from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Commerce Department.Higher incomes and flat spending pushed the savings rate to 5.5 percent of after-tax income in December. That was the highest level since December 2012."}
{"text": "Updated, 10:30 a.m.In what surely qualifies as understatement, The Timess top opinion editor calls The Timess recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary the source of plenty of reaction.Theres been a lot of readership, a lot of reader comments, the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, told me on Monday.Thats for sure. Over 5,600 comments have been posted on the editorial, which was published online Saturday and in Sundays paper. A vast majority of those comments came from Bernie Sanders supporters, who vehemently disagreed with the editorial boards conclusion. (The Times also expressed a preference, within the Republican field of candidates, for John Kasich, the Ohio governor.

Straight from the beginning basically no attention.Many readers have complained to me that Mr. Sanderss campaign and viability has been underplayed in the pages of The Times  and Ive written about this numerous times. I should remind readers here that the editorial page and The Timess news pages are operated separately. There is no involvement by the news editors or reporters in any editorial or endorsement, nor does the editorial board influence the news coverage.As weve seen throughout the campaign, the reaction had a weird and hard-to-calculate Bernie-Sanders-enthusiasm factor, because his supporters are particular skilled at getting people to speak out publicly, and make use of social media, Mr. Rosenthal told me.I asked him (because a reader had pointed it out to me) why there were no Times Picks within the comments. Mr. Rosenthal said that comments on Times editorials were never awarded the gold emblems because its illogical. It makes no sense for The Times to give extra points to those who agree or disagree with the papers own institutional voice, he said.He added that he doesnt like Times Picks anywhere: I think we should re-evaluate that practice. (This blog also does not award Times Picks. While its undoubtedly true that some comments are more incisive than others, I like to let readers judge that.)The editorial also prompted an unusual number of letters to the editor, about 200, according to Thomas Feyer, the letters editor.The letters were fairly split between agreeing and disagreeing with our editorial  probably slightly more anti-Hillary than pro-, Mr. Feyer said. And there was the usual mix between the thoughtful and well-reasoned letters, and the vitriolic and over the top.The Times published a sampling of letters on Monday that covers most of the main ideas in what we received, he said. They will appear Tuesday in print.I heard from one reader, Tom Mullaney of Chicago, who wrote: I cannot recall an endorsement coming so early and not once the race was between the nominees. He added, To me, it makes the paper too much of a player rather than observer of the campaign.One can certainly make a case against newspaper candidate endorsements  and some papers have stopped making them  but Mr. Rosenthal told me that The Times is following its usual practice of making endorsements during primaries, including mayoral and gubernatorial races, as well as presidential.There was a time, he said, when the paper genteelly waited until before the New York primary, but that no longer makes sense, if it ever did, he said.Despite the negative reaction, Mr. Rosenthal said he was not perturbed.Voting is about choosing, he said. You cant take a strong position without getting a very heated reaction. Its what I expected.The editorial was the result of a robust discussion, by the board, which includes 17 members as well as himself. Mr. Rosenthal reports to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the Times publisher. (The publisher is not a member of the editorial board, as an earlier version of this post stated.)But we came to a very strong agreement very quickly, he said. He declined to say what the precise vote was, but said that it was an easier decision than in 2008s Democratic primary. The Times endorsed Mrs. Clinton over Barack Obama.That was about two to one, Mr. Rosenthal said. This one was more definitive.Leaving aside the matter of who The Times endorsed (that is definitely outside my brief), heres my take: A well-argued newspaper endorsement has value for readers because it can synthesize issues and promote informed discussion. As for the timing, The Times is a national newspaper, so if the purpose of an endorsement editorial is to influence voting, it only makes sense to publish it before that voting has begun anywhere in the country."}
{"text": "Myanmars first freely elected Parliament after half a century of military rule opened on Monday, a symbolic but critical milestone in the countrys fragile transition to democracy, and a moment long awaited by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the nations democracy movement.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi entered the parliamentary chambers in Naypyidaw, the capital, through a side door. The chamber was swathed in orange  the color of her National League for Democracy Party, which overwhelmingly won a landmark election on Nov. 8. The military, as part of a complex political transition that has unfolded since 2010, retains 25 percent of the seats in both houses; its members wore green uniforms.At least 110 of the partys 390 members in the new Parliament are, like Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, former political prisoners. They were formally installed on Monday following an unusually jubilant celebration on Friday, with karaoke singing and dancing, to mark the end of the military-led Parliament.The honeymoon period will be brief, U Aung Zaw, an influential journalist who returned to Myanmar in 2012 after 24 years in exile, wrote on Monday on the website of his publication, The Irrawaddy. All the hard work lies ahead.Still, he called the opening of Parliament a momentous day for Burma, which was the countrys official name until 1989 and is still used by many in Myanmar.The lower house of the new Parliament elected U Win Myint, a lawyer from Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis political party and a former political prisoner, as its new speaker. But in a sign of conciliation, lawmakers picked as deputy speaker U Ti Khun Myat, a member of the Kachin ethnic minority and a representative of the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party, which is now the party in opposition.President Thein Sein, a former general who leads that party, gave a speech on Friday promoting the countrys democratic transformation. As the prime minister from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Thein Sein helped to establish a military-led civilian government and to pave the way for the end of the military juntas monopoly on power, which it had held since a 1962 coup. The transition included Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis release from house arrest in 2010, a parliamentary by-election in 2012 that put her in Parliament, improved relations with the United States and the European Union, and the easing of some economic sanctions.Mr. Thein Sein is to step down in March, and the new Parliament will choose his successor. But under the new Constitution, which was drawn up by the previous military-led government and accepted by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader is not eligible for the position because of the foreign citizenship of her husband  the British historian Michael Aris, who died in 1999  and her two sons, who hold British citizenship.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent 15 years under house arrest under the former military government, said last year that a victory by her party would put her above the president, suggesting that the next president would be, if not largely ceremonial, a loyalist essentially governing on her behalf.The National League for Democracy has been consumed with speculation about possible candidates for president. Among the names being mentioned are Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis longtime personal physician, U Tin Myo Win, who was one of the few people allowed to visit her during her years in detention; a lawmaker, Daw Su Su Lwin, and her husband, U Htin Kyaw, both democratic activists; and U Tin Oo, a former military commander in his late 80s who threw his support behind the 1988 democratic uprising that led to the partys landslide election victory in 1990. (The junta refused to recognize the results.)The military, which still controls three important ministries under the new Constitution, remains a key force in the country.In an email, Mr. Aung Zaw, the journalist, predicted that the National League for Democracy, despite its overwhelming victory last fall, would move carefully in forming a new government, which will take office in April.This is a new political beginning in Burma, he wrote. There is definitely renewed hope among people.Myanmar, a nation of 53 million people, faces enormous challenges, including widespread poverty, an underdeveloped economy and environmental degradation. There are still political prisoners, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has faced criticism for not responding more aggressively to deadly violence by members of the countrys Buddhist majority against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group.The ambassadors from Britain and the European Union were among the dignitaries at the opening of Parliament on Monday. On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of Scot Marciel, a career diplomat, to be the new American ambassador to Myanmar. This came after the Obama administration had assured lawmakers that it would not move hastily to lift sanctions until the human rights situation showed demonstrable improvement."}
{"text": "CAIRO  Miss Mona, welcome home. The airport told us youve just returned from Vienna.I knew from the private caller ID that appeared on my phone that it was National Security calling to remind me  as if Id forgotten  that they kept tabs on me. I had indeed just returned to Cairo from months abroad promoting my book, but Vienna had not been on my itinerary. That was a reminder, too, of the incompetence that laces even the sinister in Egypt.The officer, who identified himself by rank and first name only, did correctly name other places I had visited, including some I had not mentioned on my Twitter feed. That led me to believe the agency also monitors networks like WhatsApp and FaceTime chats that I use for private communications.We just wanted to check in with you, he said. Did you visit Israel? Were calling you because you used to live in Israel. Has anyone offered you any work?I was a Reuters correspondent in Jerusalem years earlier, from 1997 to 1999. Egypt and Israel have been at peace since the 1979 Camp David peace treaty; even so, Egyptians who visit Israel are regarded with suspicion and are often subjected to questioning upon return. I told the officer that I would not answer his questions unless my attorney was present, and ended the call.This was my second phone call in three months. In September, on the pretext that they were updating their records, Officer Rank and First Name wanted to know whom I worked for and if I had any trips planned. I was visiting my parents that day, so they sent a low-ranking foot soldier with a phone through which I spoke to the officer. I got the message: They knew where to find me.He asked me if I had moved back to Egypt permanently. Why are you asking me questions you know the answers to? I replied.I joke with friends that a phone call is a promotion of sorts. From the start of my journalism career in Egypt in the early 1990s, I joined the many journalists and activists who are surveilled by the government. Sometimes, a state security officer would send a note inviting me to tea  what a perfect euphemism for an interrogation  at headquarters.For my first invitation to tea with the agency then known as the State Security Investigations Service  or just State Security, as we called it  two officers escorted me from the Reuters Cairo bureau, where I was a correspondent, to their headquarters. There, I was threatened with a night in jail if I didnt reveal the source of a story. I refused, and after a few hours I was released with the backhanded patriarchal compliment Youre a tough girl.State Security as Big Daddy took on a whole new meaning when I returned to Cairo after my stint in Jerusalem. When I went in for tea, I had my very own assigned officer, who had given himself the nom de guerre of Omar Sharif (no relation, absolutely no resemblance).Mona Eltahawy! Finally! Youre a real character! Mr. Sharif exclaimed. Who on earth goes to Israel? I have to meet your father. If my daughter ever told me she wanted to go to Israel Id break her neck!Sitting across a desk from Omar Sharif as he held up files he said were full of information gleaned from my being followed and from my phones being tapped was bad enough. But our encounter turned Kafka-esque when he took out a photograph of his wife, a woman in a head scarf who he said was a religious instructor in a local mosque.Are you married? How old are you? A woman like you can never get married, he said. Whos going to want to marry you with the life you lead, every day in a different city? Youll end up with a man like my brother, a womanizer, wholl cheat on you.A few months later, while I was visiting some relatives, together with my parents and my sister who had come from out of town, the telephone rang. It was Omar Sharif.He knew my father was in Cairo, and demanded to speak to him, too. The next day, my father told me that Mr. Sharif had said that I lived a life that was not suitable for Egypt.Although the organization existed before the nearly 30-year regime of President Hosni Mubarak, it became one of the myriad civilian security services he used to keep a seesaw balance with the rival power of the military. For a brief period, in 2011, after we turned out Mr. Mubarak and wrong-footed the old men who run Egypt, the State Security Investigations Service was abolished.Those of us with firsthand experience understood that this was essentially a rebranding process. Lo, State Security was laid to rest in March 2011; behold, it was resurrected soon after as National Security.I often wonder if Omar Sharif made the transition from one to the other. And I worry what he and his colleagues are doing with the Egyptian governments increasing ability to trawl data from applications like Skype, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube with the help of See Egypt, the sister company of the American-based cybersecurity firm Blue Coat.National Security is also busy rounding people up. Four members of the April 6 Youth Movements political bureau were recently taken from their homes in middle-of-the night raids. The government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi also targeted Facebook group administrators, a publishing house and an art gallery in a crackdown ahead of last months anniversary of the 2011 revolution.I am lucky because I am a known writer whose profile protects her. National Securitys combination of viciousness and incompetence leans hardest on those with the least protection: the young and the anonymous. These days, Egypts youth cant expect an invitation to tea."}
{"text": "Several studies suggest that men find women more attractive when they are in the ovulatory phase of their menstrual cycle.The thesis takes a strange turn in a new study in which women were questioned: Each subject was asked whether a woman in an image was likely to entice a man that she was dating.Although women do not find images of ovulatory women particularly attractive, scientists found, women with higher estrogen levels did perceive such images to be more threatening.Women with high estrogen, the researchers noted, have a high potential for fertility. Were still trying to pinpoint exactly what all is involved in this, said Janek S. Lobmaier, a psychologist at the University of Bern."}
{"text": "What happens when the nations foremost voice on the race question is also its most confined and restrained? Michael Eric Dyson raises this question about President Obama in his latest book, The Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America. The book inspires one to raise similar questions about Dyson himself. For, while hardly restrained, Dyson appears noticeably boxed in by the limitations placed on celebrity race commentators in the Age of Obama.Readers will recognize Dysons practiced flair for language and metaphor as he makes an important and layered argument about American political culture and the narrowness of presidential speech. The book argues that Americans live under a black presidency  not so much because the president is black, but because Obamas presidency remains bound by the rules and rituals of black respectability and white supremacy. Even the leader of the free world, we learn in Dysons book, conforms principally to white expectations. (Dyson maintained in the November issue of The New Republic that Hillary Clinton may well do more for black people than Obama did.) But Obamas presidency is black in a more hopeful way, too, providing Americans with an opportunity to better realize the nations democratic ideals and promises. Obamas achievement gestures toward what the state had not allowed at the highest level before his emergence, Dyson writes. Equality of opportunity, fairness in democracy and justice in society.A certain optimism ebbs and flows in The Black Presidency, but only occasionally does it refer to white Americans beliefs about race. Far more often, Dyson hangs hope on Obamas impromptu shows of racial solidarity. One such moment was the presidents remarks after the 2009 arrest of the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. (who was arrested trying to get into his own home). Another was Obamas public identification with Trayvon Martin. Both acts may have been politically risky, but they also greatly heartened African- Americans. Hope builds, and by books end, readers find a chapter-long celebration of the presidents soaring invocations of Amazing Grace during last years memorial service for the slain parishioners of Emanuel A.M.E. Church. For Dyson, the eulogy at Emanuel seems to serve as a sign of grace that black America may still yet enjoy from the Obama White House.Its cresting invocations of hope aside, the book ably maintains a sharp critical edge. Dyson uncovers a troubling consistency to the presidents race speech and shows that in spite of Obamas reliance on black political networks and black votes during his meteoric rise, the president chose to follow a governing and rhetorical template largely hewed by his white predecessors. As both candidate and president, Obamas speeches have tended to allay white guilt. They have scolded African-American masses for cultural pathology and implied that blacks were to blame for lingering white antipathy. Obamas speeches have also often consigned the worst forms of racism and anti-black violence to the past or to the fringes of American political culture. One finds passive-voice constructions everywhere in Obamas race talk, as black folk are found suffering under pressures and at the hands of parties that go largely unnamed. Obama is forced to exaggerate black responsibility, Dyson advances, because he must always underplay white responsibility.Critically, Dyson contends that the presidents tepid anti-racism comes from political pragmatism rather than a set of deeper ideological concerns. Obama is anti-ideological, Dyson maintains, and that is the very reason he was electable.That characterization, however, overlooks how liberal pragmatism functions as ideology. Whats more, it ignores the marginalization and violence that black and brown people often suffer  at home and abroad  whenever moderates resolve to get things done. If the Obama era proved anything about liberalism, its that there remains little room for an explicit policy approach to racial justice  even, or perhaps especially, under a black president. As Obama himself explains to Dyson: I have to appropriate dollars for any program which has to go through ways and means committees, or appropriations committees, that are not dominated by folks who read Cornel West or listen to Michael Eric Dyson.Upon a careful reading of Dysons book, loss seems always to arrive on the heels of hope. As we might expect, the author explores Obamas estrangement from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright in 2008. He also attends to his own very public and more recent split from Cornel West. But even beyond these signal episodes, The Black Presidency is suffused with a bittersweet tone about relationships strained. President Obama seems to leave a host of people and political commitments at the White House door as he conforms to the racial demands of a historically white office. Even Dyson seems unaware of all the ways in which The Black Presidency, as a book, both explicates and illustrates how the Obama administration leaves black folk behind.All but the last two of the books eight chapters begin with the author placing himself in close and often luxurious proximity to Obama. The repetition has the literary effect of a Facebook feed. Here is Michael at Oprahs sumptuous California mansion during a 2007 fund-raiser, sharing a joke with Barack and Chris Rock. Here is Michael on the private plane and in the S.U.V., giving the candidate tips on how to use a blacker rhetorical style during his debate performances against a surging Hillary Clinton. Here he is in the V.I.P. section of the 50th-anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington and, yet again, at the White House Correspondents Association dinner. Through these and similar moments, Dyson projects his status and, in ways less clear, his authority. Dyson knows Obama, the reader is assured, because he has kept his company. He has swapped playful taunts and bro-hugs with the president; he has been intimate, one might say, with history.Moments like these have a secondary effect. They illuminate a tension cutting through and profoundly limiting The Black Presidency as a work of political commentary. Regardless of who Michael Eric Dyson may have been to Obama the candidate, Dyson now has barely any access to Obama the president. Time and circumstance have rendered Dyson, the man and the thinker, increasingly irrelevant to Obamas presidency. He can be at the party, but not at the table.Perhaps worse in relation to the books stated aim to be the first full measure of Obama and Americas race problem, Dyson, the author, has none but only the smallest role to play in assessing and narrating Obamas legacy. When Bill Clinton decided to chronicle his own historic turn in the White House, he called on Taylor Branch and recorded with the historian some 150 hours of interviews over 79 separate sessions. Dyson, in 2015, gets far shabbier treatment. Chapter 5, The Scold of Black Folk, opens: I was waiting outside the Oval Office to speak to President Obama. I had a tough time getting on his schedule. In response to Dysons request for a presidential audience, the White House offered the author 10 whole minutes. By his own telling, Dyson politely declined and pressed Obamas confidante, Valerie Jarrett, to remember his long history with and support of the president. I eventually negotiated a 20-minute interview that turned into half an hour. It appears to be the only interview Dyson conducted for the book.In the end, The Black Presidency possesses a loaves-and-fishes quality. Drawing mostly on the news cycle, close readings of carefully crafted speeches and a handful of glittering encounters, Dyson has managed to do a lot with a little. The book might well be considered an interpretive miracle, one performed in fealty and hope for a future show of presidential grace, either from this president or, should she get elected, the next one."}
{"text": "Updated at 10:00 a.m.Good morning on this bright Tuesday.Iowa hardly seems like a natural habitat for those of the New York species.A visit to the Hawkeye State means swapping hot dogs for corn dogs and pavement for pastures.And yet, the results of the caucuses there are looking (at least relatively) good for the three candidates with strong New York ties: Donald J. Trump finished in second place in the Republican race, while Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders remain nearly deadlocked in the Democratic contest.The city slickers all have very different relationships with New York.Mr. Trump was raised in a two-story Tudor-style home in an affluent enclave in Queens. Since then, he has grown into a city icon, with a persona as yuge as the buildings that bear his name.If the accent didnt already give it away, Mr. Sanderss roots are in Brooklyn, though he eventually settled in Vermont.While Mr. Sanders jettisoned New York, Mrs. Clinton transplanted herself here after leaving the White House. Her move was met with some skepticism, as critics accused her of carpetbagging in her run for senate.As the candidates crisscrossed Iowa, their Gotham backgrounds came under fire when New York values were referenced with more than a little contempt.Still, that didnt stop Mayor Bill de Blasio from joining the fray with a visit over the weekend to canvass for Mrs. Clinton.The Times political reporter Alexander Burns told us that despite some groans, voters had yet to reveal any real New York fatigue.Their patience might be further tested, with Michael R. Bloomberg threatening to set forth as a third-party candidate.That, Mr. Burns said, might invite a fourth candidate into the ring.Heres what else is happening:WEATHERDust off those parasols.

{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.)Good evening. Heres the latest.1. The presidential candidates emerged from Iowa and shifted their focus to New Hampshires primaries next Tuesday. Judging Iowas winners and losers was complicated. Marco Rubios solid third place was almost as much of a victory as Ted Cruzs first among Republicans, while Donald Trumps second place was a definite loss._____2. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanderss near tie was an upset of Hillary Clinton, and she is charging full strength at New Hampshire while energy  and money  pours into his campaign. And yet, our analyst notes, the close finish may be more worrying for Mr. Sanders than for Mrs. Clinton._____3. Yahoo beat expectations for quarterly revenue but not earnings, and, under pressure from frustrated investors, said it would explore selling assets and laying off 15 percent of its workers. But, as expected, Googles parent company, Alphabet, overtook Apple as the worlds most valuable publicly traded company.U.S. stock markets fell as the price of oil dropped again. The Dow lost 1.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq 2.2 percent._____4. Bill Cosby attended a pretrial hearing in Pennsylvania, facing the first criminal charges to come from the dozens of accusations of sexual assault lodged against him. His lawyers contend that 10 years ago, a district attorney agreed that Mr. Cosby would never be prosecuted in this particular case, which involved a young woman managing a Temple University basketball team._____5. Its hard to believe in the digital age, but there is just one known copy of Super Bowl I. And you cant watch it. The tapes, made by a Pennsylvania man and inherited by his son, languish in storage. The son, Troy Haupt, offered to sell them to the N.F.L. for $1 million, but the league wont go above $30,000  and warned of him legal action if he sold to anyone else. Its like youve won the golden ticket but you cant get into the chocolate factory, Mr. Haupt said._____6. Health authorities in Dallas reported a case of the Zika virus, normally spread by mosquito bite, being passed on via sex by someone who had returned from Venezuela. They offered no further details but stepped up public warnings to use condoms._____7. North Korea announced that it would launch a long-range rocket this month, saying it planned to put a satellite in orbit. But the U.S. and its allies believe that such a launch would probably be a cover for a program meant to develop a missile that could deliver a nuclear bomb._____8. Many cultures give the dreams of the dying sacred status. Now a team of clinicians and researchers in western New York is working on understanding the dreams importance, hoping to help the moribund. Often when we sedate them, we are sterilizing them from their own dying process, a doctor said. I have done it, and it feels horrible. Theyll say, You robbed me  I was with my wife. _____9. Two large rodents agreed that the U.S. was due for an early spring. Neither Punxsutawney Phil nor Staten Island Chuck, above, saw his shadow on Groundhog Day._____10. But winter was in full swing in the West and Midwest. A major storm swept east from Colorado, swamping Denver and then moving into Iowa, above, and bringing blizzard warnings for Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota and Minnesota._____11. South Park its not. Chinas Communist Party propagandists put out the animated video above, a mash-up of party slogans and Chinese rap. Aimed at the young and politically disaffected, the video features catchy lyrics like, There will be no panic in our hearts, as long as food is not a concern and our hands are full of money.

{"text": "A grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a reform-minded cleric who was disqualified last week from running for election to an important clerical council in Iran, received a significant endorsement on Monday from an influential former president, a possible indication that his candidacy might be revived. The grandson, Hassan Khomeini, 43, has said he would appeal his disqualification to run for a seat on the council, known as the Assembly of Experts, which is empowered to choose the next supreme leader. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president and political veteran who was close to Mr. Khomeinis grandfather, the founder of the Islamic Republic, was quoted in state media as saying that the vetters of candidates had no right to disqualify Mr. Khomeini."}
{"text": "On Monday night, as much of the nation looked toward Iowa for hints of its political future, the insular world of mens fashion took a moment to raise a glass and give a toast to, well, itself.A crowd of mens wear cognoscenti  with the requisite celebrity interlopers and hangers-on  trekked to the Far West Side of Manhattan to a dimly lighted hangar-like space for cocktails and passed hors doeuvres to celebrate New York Fashion Week: Mens.The event, now in its second season, features runway shows and presentations from American fashion brands including John Varvatos, Todd Snyder and Public School, separate from the womens wear hoopla later this month.The party was held by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Dockers, the khakis brand that turns 30 this year.The first time, you have to prove yourself, and we proved that it could, and did, work, said Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the C.F.D.A., sounding triumphant after admitting that there were cynics when the council decided to begin the initiative last season. A sophomore outing indicates that, despite the naysayers, the inaugural edition was ultimately a success.Waiters wore Dockers white oxford shirts and slim beige khakis while passing out quesadillas and candy treats to revelers, many of whom had blunt Brooklyn haircuts and septum rings, and wore Chelsea boots and a lot of black.The actor Colton Haynes from Arrow was there, wearing Ovadia & Sons and talking with the designers, while the model Tyson Beckford made the rounds among magazine editors and bloggers.The C.F.D.A. also gathered a cadre of high-profile ambassadors, borrowing heavily from the world of sports, who will attend shows and, in turn, bring attention to the proceedings. The roster includes the fashion week newbie Matt Harvey, the 26-year-old New York Mets pitcher, and the front-row regular Victor Cruz, the 29-year-old New York Giants wide receiver.Im excited to bounce around with Victor and see some different brands, said Mr. Harvey, wearing a black leather jacket, blue athletic sweatshirt and gray khakis. He was dressed by Dockers for the event but was sporting multicolored Valentino sneakers and said that, of late, hes been gravitating to Dior Homme tailoring. Their suits are really fabulous, he said, adding, Its New York, so you want to look good.Mr. Cruz was wearing an outfit he designed with the denim brand 3x1. Im blessed to have a lot of friends in the industry like Chris Stamp, John Elliott, the Ovadia brothers, he said, so its cool to catch up with them and see what theyre doing.And how has designing changed the way he approaches fashion week? My good friend Ronnie Fieg, he makes me look at all the details, Mr. Cruz said.

{"text": "Myron Beldock, a lawyer who championed seemingly lost criminal causes but won freedom for various wrongly convicted men, including the former boxer Rubin (Hurricane) Carter after he had served 19 years in prison for three murders in New Jersey, died on Monday at a hospice in Manhattan. He was 86.His wife, Karen L. Dippold, confirmed the death but did not specify the cause. Mr. Beldock lived in Greenwich Village.The son of a Brooklyn judge, Mr. Beldock specialized in criminal and civil rights law but styled himself an old-time general practitioner. Most of his cases were not high-profile murder-and-mayhem trials, and most of his days in court were spent ingloriously with clients accused of wrongdoing that never made headlines, or with plaintiffs, many of them poor and black, who contended that their rights had been infringed on by employers or government agencies.I was a creature of my time, liberal, progressive and idealistic, he said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. Yes, I wanted to rectify injustices and improve the criminal justice system. But basically, I took whatever came my way.Mr. Beldock became nationally known for defending people who had already been convicted and imprisoned, like Mr. Carter and his co-defendant, John Artis  black men who were accused of firing shotgun and pistol blasts that killed two white men and a white woman in a Paterson, N.J., bar in 1966. Mr. Carter, a leading middleweight at the time, said he had been a victim of racial bias, framed for speaking out on civil rights.Mr. Beldock, over more than a decade, helped to expose false testimony by witnesses and misconduct by Passaic County prosecutors in two earlier trials, helping Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis win reversals in 1985.The case inspired celebrity protests; a song by Bob Dylan; best-selling books, including Mr. Carters autobiography, The 16th Round (1974); and a 1999 movie, The Hurricane, starring Denzel Washington as Mr. Carter.In another major case, Mr. Beldock represented Yusef Salaam, one of five young black and Latino men who had falsely confessed on videotape to the 1989 beating and rape of a woman who became known as the Central Park jogger. After serving terms of seven and a half years to 13 and a half years, the five were exonerated in 2002, when an imprisoned serial rapist, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime and prosecutors confirmed his account with DNA evidence.Early in his career, Mr. Beldock won dismissal of an attempted rape charge against George Whitmore Jr., a teenager arrested in Brooklyn in 1964 who would become a national symbol of injustice.After days of questioning, Mr. Whitmore confessed to the attempted rape of a nurse, the rape and murder of a Brooklyn woman and the knife killings of Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert in 1963 in Manhattan, a case known as the Career Girl Murders. He later recanted the confessions, saying he had been beaten into signing the statements.In the attempted rape case, Mr. Whitmore was convicted twice and sentenced to five to 10 years after the second trial, largely on the testimony of the nurse, Elba Borrero. The first verdict was reversed after a finding of prejudice on the jury; the second after it was found that his confession was tainted.Mr. Whitmore had been incarcerated for three years when Mr. Beldock, in a third trial, successfully challenged the victims identification of the perpetrator; she had viewed him through a peephole in a police station where Mr. Whitmore stood out as the only black man in a lineup.All I know is, George Whitmore attacked me that night, Ms. Borerro said during Mr. Beldocks relentless cross-examination, which exposed numerous contradictions in her story. Stop bothering me. I know it, he knows it and God knows it.When Mr. Beldock objected, she jumped up and said, You werent raped that night, sir.Mr. Beldock objected again. A broken Ms. Borerro, turning to the bench, pleaded, Judge, do you know what it is to go through this for five years?Mr. Beldock retorted, Do you know what it is to spend three years in jail?There was no answer. Mr. Beldock had won his point.After many witnesses said Mr. Whitmore had been in Wildwood, N.J., on the day of the Wylie-Hoffert murders, prosecutors in 1965 dismissed those charges and the Brooklyn rape-and-murder case.Coerced confessions by Mr. Whitmore became instrumental in the 1966 Miranda decision by the Supreme Court, which required the police to advise suspects of their rights to remain silent and be represented by a lawyer. They were also decisive in the 1965 repeal of capital punishment in New York State except in the murder of police officers.Mr. Beldock was a rumpled figure with an actors repertoire in court. He could fumble with papers at the defense table, shrug, feign forgetfulness, give the impression he had finished questioning a witness and then jump up with one more question  and start into a tigerish attack that was the heart of the matter.He was a hero to many civil rights leaders, who called him a crusader for justice. But prosecutors, police officials and police union leaders often questioned his tactics, insisting that he freed killers and notorious criminals on technicalities and eroded respect for the law in the guise of protecting civil liberties. In any case, Mr. Beldock was no idealist.The world isnt run by idealism; its run by power and money, he told The New York Times in 2004 after winning a round in a civil proceeding for the family of Gidone Busch, an emotionally disturbed Hasidic man shot and killed by police officers in Brooklyn in 1999. Power is easily misused by those in power. You either roll over or you fight back.Myron Beldock was born in Brooklyn on March 27, 1929, to George and Irene Goldstein Beldock. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1946 and from Hamilton College in upstate New York in 1950. After serving in the Army from 1951 to 1954, he earned his law degree from Harvard in 1958. He was an assistant federal prosecutor in Brooklyn from 1958 to 1960. In 1964, he helped form Beldock, Levine & Hoffman, his professional base.In 1953, Mr. Beldock married Elizabeth Pease. They were divorced in 1969. He married Ms. Dippold, a lawyer with his firm, in 1986. Besides her, his survivors include four children from his first marriage, David, Benjamin, Jennifer Fogarty and Hannah Beldock; another son, Adam Schmalholz; and three grandchildren.Mr. Beldocks most famous client was Hurricane Carter. Except for being black, neither Mr. Carter nor his co-defendant, Mr. Artis, matched the original descriptions of the killers in the New Jersey bar.Entertainment, sports, civil rights and political leaders rallied to support Mr. Carter in the first trial, in 1967. Witnesses said both defendants were elsewhere at the time of the shootings. But two witnesses placed them at the scene, and the defendants were convicted and sentenced to long terms. The celebrity support melted away. In prison, the defiant Mr. Carter refused to work or wear a uniform.Mr. Beldock joined the case in 1973. He won a new trial in 1974 after the New Jersey public defender and The Times independently obtained recantations from the two key prosecution witnesses, who said they had been pressured into giving false testimony. But one recanted his recantation at the second trial, and the defendants were convicted again in 1976.Mr. Artis was paroled in 1981. In 1985, after state appeals for Mr. Carters release failed, Mr. Beldock obtained a federal court hearing in Newark, and Judge H. Lee Sarokin overturned the convictions on grounds that prosecutors had withheld evidence disproving their last eyewitness testimony and improperly made the assertion that racial revenge was the motive for the killings. Mr. Carter was released, and the New Jersey attorney general did not reinstate the cases. Mr. Carter died in 2014.After prosecution efforts ended in 1988, Mr. Beldock gave a celebratory party at his Greenwich Village apartment. The real story, he said, is the fact that good triumphs over evil, and how hard it is to get there."}
{"text": "Join us for live coverage of the Iowa caucuses.The Iowa caucuses signal the official start to the 2016 presidential nominating process, and an end to months of candidates courtship of voters in the state. While a victory in Iowa does not always lead to a candidate capturing the nomination, it often provides a significant boost to the top finishers and has the potential to reorder dynamics of the race.Heres some background and a look ahead:The caucuses have been taking place in Iowa for decades, but in 1972 they became the first contest in the nominating process. The Democratic Party made rule changes that required the state to move its caucuses earlier after problems at the 1968 Democratic National Convention led to a desire for more transparency in the delegate allocation process. Jimmy Carters strong showing in 1976 was credited with catapulting him into the presidency and with giving Iowans their special influence.Besides momentum, there are some delegates to be won. Democrats allocate 44 delegates  though none of them will be bound to any candidate as a result  and there are 30 at stake for Republicans. They are awarded proportionally based on the outcome of the caucuses and Democratic candidates need to win at least 15 percent of the votes statewide to be eligible to secure any of the delegates.The Republican winner has not gone on to win the nomination since George W. Bush in 2000. Iowans kicked off Senator Barack Obamas upstart presidential bid with a win in 2008.The caucuses begin 8 p.m. Eastern time in 1,681 precincts across the state.In some cases the process could take as little as 45 minutes and results will trickle out through the night. The prospect of a big snowstorm hitting the state could encourage Iowans to finish up faster.Iowans like to defy expectations and decisions about candidates are often made at caucus time. As voters head to their precincts, the latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll has Donald J. Trump leading Senator Ted Cruz by a slim margin on the Republican side, with Senator Marco Rubio in third place. For the Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders are deadlocked for the lead, with Martin OMalley a distant third."}

{"text": "GENEVA  The United Nations top human rights official urged Turkey on Monday to investigate a report that the army shot unarmed civilians in the mainly Kurdish southeast, and expressed alarm at a crackdown on journalists and critics of the countrys government.Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said Turkish authorities should open an independent investigation of the shooting in the southeastern town of Cizre.The events were captured by what Mr. al-Hussein called an extremely shocking film by a Turkish journalist, which appears to show a group of people, some holding white flags, being shot at while they pushed a cart carrying bodies in view of an armored vehicle.Two people were said to have been killed and nine others wounded in the episode about 10 days ago. The wounded included the journalist who had filmed the shooting, Refik Tekin. The local prosecutors office has issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Tekin, alleging that he is a member of a unnamed terrorist organization.The government has severely limited journalists coverage of the southeast and has arrested some who have covered clashes between the government and Kurdish militants.Mr. al-Hussein acknowledged the major difficulties that Turkey faces in the southeastern part of the country, where security forces are engaged in operations against Kurdish militants. But he also drew attention to deteriorating human rights in the area and emphasized that if state operatives commit human rights violations, they must be prosecuted.The possibility that Mr. Tekin might be detained and prosecuted only deepened Mr. al-Husseins already considerable concern about the Turkish governments treatment of journalists. Filming an atrocity is not a crime, but shooting unarmed civilians most certainly is, he said.The number of journalists convicted of crimes or awaiting trial, along with extraordinarily harsh sentences of life imprisonment that prosecutors have sought against two newspaper editors, cast doubt on Turkeys adherence to rights conventions, Mr. al-Hussein said.A quick way to show that it does, indeed, respect these rights fully would be to free all those, he said, whether they are journalists, academics or human rights defenders, who have been detained or prosecuted simply for recording or criticizing the actions of the state."}
{"text": "MEXICO CITY  It was not long after the first trumpets on Sunday that Jos Toms found himself in familiar territory: inches from the vicious horns of a fighting bull, so close they nearly brushed up against the pink silk of his traje de luces, or suit of lights.Careful not to twitch a muscle, which could have been a trigger for the bull to attack him, Toms stood firm in this dangerous position and alone at the center of the Plaza Mxico, the biggest bullring in the world. Tomss cultish followers are called Tomasistas, and the bullring was filled with more than 45,000 spectators, the largest draw for a matador in recent memory.All of them were eager to witness the Great One before he decided to retire or before another horn wound ended his career for him.Toms, 40, was not like other matadors. He was the embodiment of mystery  in and out of the ring. For years, he has refused to give interviews or to appear on television. You had to see him live to see him at all, and he performed so infrequently, usually once or twice a year, that tickets sold out within hours.His mastery, though, was not only in his marketing. Tomss performances were savage ballets, a blend of elegance, fearlessness, timing and sacrifice. He seemed determined to pass bulls ever closer to his body, pushing the boundaries of how close a man could get.Hes a mystic, Allen Josephs, a professor of literature and Spanish studies at the University of West Florida who has written extensively about matadors and bulls, said in a recent interview for the magazine True.Ink. We want the great matador to bring the animal in closer and closer and closer. Its playing with death. Why do we play with death? Because by playing with death, in some ways, we overcome it.By overcoming death, Toms represented a kind of immortality, and now here he was, swinging the red muleta behind his back, the red furls of the wool cloth slicing through air heavy with cigar smoke as the 1,150-pound Bellotero, his first bull of the afternoon, gazed at his tiny waist. Finally, Toms made a pass, and the crowd exploded.Ol!Then another pass.Ol!Then he got too close. A horn caught the inside of Tomss leg. He crashed to the sand, and the crowd shrieked as the bulls horns tore away at the back of his thighs.As a teenager in a suburb of Madrid, where the bullfighting schools are perhaps the most competitive in Spain, Toms struggled to attract attention from the bullring promoters, managers and financiers who bankroll young matadors. He moved to Mexico to attract attention and perfected a style of bullfighting so dangerous he has nearly been killed.In 2010, Toms had just finished an effortless natural, or left-handed pass, in Aguascalientes, Mexico, when a bull plunged his horn into Tomss thigh, punctured the femoral artery and drained much of the blood from his body. For a while, it was unclear whether Toms would survive.When your mind has gotten used to the fact that you will die and then you dont, life turns a different color, said Antonio Barrera, a matador who sustained countless gorings and nearly bled to death as a teenager with an injury similar to the one Toms sustained in Aguascalientes. In 2012, Barrera spoke in Gored, a coming documentary that captures his final bullfight, about how overcoming death had allowed him to perform with abandon.For me, the bull is like a god, Barrera said. The wild bull has a lot of values the human being admires: to be fierce, to be impetuous, to have a breed, to have self-esteem, to fight for what you want, to fight for your life. Thats why you consider him a god, and why in many cultures he has been considered a god.Bullfighting is more religion than sport, more sacrifice than killing, a ritual left from the ancient world. Among the pharaohs of Egypt, the wandering tribes of the Levant, the Greek and Cretan amphitheaters, the bulls of the ancient world were deities.In the eyes of these people, the bull had become a symbol of the all-powerful and the all-fertile, Jack Randolph Conrad wrote in The Horn and the Sword, an anthropological history of the human-bull relationship. Bulls represented the spirit of immortality, Conrad wrote, and were worshiped in elaborate ways.In ancient Egypt, women appeared naked in front of bulls to absorb their fertile powers, and Roman soldiers bathed in bull blood and feasted on bull testicles to obtain the immortal spirit. The bulls were sacrificed in elaborate rituals by taurine priests to bestow their godly powers to the public, and the modern bullfight can be viewed as a distant, commercialized relative of these ancient sacrifices.It all comes back to sacrifice, Josephs said. You know, the matadors are really the only high priests from the pagan days we have left.In the Plaza Mxico on Sunday, as Toms lay crumpled in the sand, helpers lured Bellotero away. But not for long. Only a few passes later, Toms was on the ground again, as the bull hooked his horns underneath the jacket of Tomss suit and trampled him. Somehow, the horns missed him, and Toms went on to register a remarkable performance. His derechazos, or right-hand passes, were long and smooth, and his left-hand passes were timed perfectly.He then placed the sword cleanly, and earned an ear, or trophy, though the audience was clamoring for two ears, an honor akin to a triumph that would allow him to be carried from the plaza on shoulders.He gives me the entire range of emotions, Pedro Prez, a Tomasista, said as Toms made his way back to the passageway around the ring, his face covered with dirt. I dont know if I want to be happy or sad, cheer or cry. You never know what will happen next.Prez had arrived early from Tlaxcala, another state, and had rarely seen the streets outside the bullring so packed. Vendors had set out their grills and paella pans, and restaurant tables were filled with aficionados wearing sombreros and ascots and feasting on specialties like shrimp tacos doused in cheese sauce and washing it all down with cold micheladas, beer cocktails laced with pepper flakes and spiked with clam juice.Oddly, it was hard to find any animal rights activists, who have developed a presence in Mexico City, often shouting through their bullhorns that something as cruel as the bullfight should be abolished in places that still hold them: the south of France; Spain, outside of Barcelona; Portugal; Peru; Mexico; Colombia; Ecuador; Guatemala; and Venezuela.The bullfight here, featuring Toms and Joselito Adame, a Mexican matador, was the biggest of the winter season, if not the coming year. Before the gates opened, front-row seats were being resold on websites for nearly $8,000 each.Bullfighting may have taken a financial beating in recent years  from protests, prohibitions, the struggles of the Spanish economy  but Toms has been considered a kind of savior amid the dwindling spectacle, a lone figure who, through his bravery and art, can still inspire a new generation of enthusiasts.But inside the stadium, as the sun fell and the house lights came on, Toms struggled. His second bull lacked strength, and despite the engineering of some breathtaking passes, he missed and struggled with his sword, killing poorly.And with his last bull, he never had a chance. Once the chute swung open and the animal emerged, the frustrated crowd whistled in protest. The bull, despite its speed, was too small, they felt. A substitute bull was called in. This bull was also small, and lacked strength, and Toms had no choice but to kill it quickly and register his most disappointing performance in years.Adame then seized the moment. With the final bull of the day, he executed all the tricks to win the laggard crowd over. He dropped to his knees, spun the capes like pinwheels and got so close he touched the horns with his fingers.He even attempted a dangerous style of killing called recibiendo, placing the sword as the bull charged into him rather than jumping over the horns. The move capped a performance that lacked Tomss poetry but earned Adame a triumphant two ears for excitement. Adame, not Toms, was carried through the streets as fans reached out to touch his hand, his suit of lights  any part of him. It was as if they were touching a saint.Back at his hotel, Toms emerged to have a late dinner with his handlers. He wore dark jeans, black shoes, a flamenco-style scarf. He was asked how he felt.What can one do? he said in Spanish, shaking his head. He looked sullen and deflated and very much like a typical matador after a rough afternoon  no longer the mysterious god of the bulls so many people had come to see."}
{"text": "The San Diego Archaeology Center holds a pair of extraordinary skeletons. Dating back about 9,500 years, they are among the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas.A number of scientists would love to study the bones, using powerful new techniques to extract any surviving DNA.These skeletons of such antiquity are so important for helping us understand what happened in the past in North America, said Brian Kemp, a molecular anthropologist at Washington State University.But for years, the remains have been out of reach, the subject of a legal struggle that pitted three University of California scientists against their own administration and the Kumeyaay, a group of Native American tribes.The skeletons were found in San Diegos La Jolla community in 1976 by an archaeology class digging on land owned by the University of California, San Diego. In 2006, a group of tribes laid claim to the skeletons, and the university later agreed to transfer custody. To block the transfer, the scientists went to court.After losing in lower courts, the scientists in November asked the United States Supreme Court to become involved. This week, the court declined. That decision swept away the last obstacle to the transfer.Its hard to describe how bad I feel, said Robert L. Bettinger, one of the plaintiffs in the case and a professor at the University of California, Davis. To have them slip through our fingers this way is a tremendous loss for science.Steven Banegas, spokesman for the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, which claimed the skeletons, said the tribes would meet to decide what to do with the remains. He did not rule out that scientists could study them. These things we need to discuss, he said. We want to be the ones who tell our own story.At the time the skeletons were found, archaeologists were relatively free to do with Native American remains as they saw fit. That changed with the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. The law was a response to some ugly chapters in the history of research on Native Americans. Grave robbers had plundered skeletons and sacred objects, some of which were stockpiled in museums.The act established a legal procedure by which Native Americans could claim cultural objects and human remains kept in museums or found on public land. More than 1.4 million objects and remains of 50,000 people have been transferred under the act, but some cases have sparked conflicts.In 1996, for example, hikers stumbled across an 8,500-year-old skeleton in Kennewick, Wash. Native American tribes claimed the skeleton, intending to rebury it. But scientists challenged their claim, and after eight years of legal battling, they won the opportunity to study the remains. Most recently, geneticists retrieved enough DNA from the Kennewick Mans bones to reconstruct his entire genome.Last year, the scientists reported that he was closely related to living Native Americans. That finding strongly weighed against earlier claims that Kennewick Man might be related to Polynesians or even Europeans.Ancient skeletons like Kennewick Man and the La Jolla remains can offer clues to how humans spread across the Americas. Researchers generally agree that people moved from Asia over the Bering Land Bridge roughly 15,000 years ago.How they spread from there is still the subject of fierce debate. Did they move down through the center of North America? Did their route hug the coast? The La Jolla remains, excavated from a cliff overlooking the Pacific, could offer some clarity.The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, representing 12 bands of Native Americans in Southern California, filed a claim for the La Jolla remains in 2006.To determine what connection the remains might have to its people, the committee asked Arion Mayes, a San Diego State anthropologist who had worked on Kumeyaay skeletons, to conduct an examination, on the condition that she not destroy any of the material. It was a great honor, Dr. Mayes said.Dr. Mayes found clues about what the two people had been like in life. One was a man who died in his mid- to late 20s. He had a strong right arm that he may have built up through the use of a spear thrower. The other, a woman in her late 30s or early 40s, had teeth that showed signs of having been worn down by stripping fibers for making baskets.She used her teeth as tools, Dr. Mayes said.The University of California, for its part, appointed a committee of professors to evaluate the tribes claim. In 2008, they concluded that the skeletons were culturally unidentifiable. The grave contained no objects that might have established a cultural link, and the committee found no compelling evidence that these were ancient relatives of the Kumeyaay people.Even so, Dr. Bettinger, a member of the committee, said in an interview that he grew concerned that the university would rush a transfer of the skeletons, and that the Kumeyaay would deny access.So in 2010, he asked the university for permission to study the remains. So did Margaret J. Schoeninger, an anthropologist at the University of California, San Diego, and Tim D. White of the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Schoeninger was denied, and Dr. Bettinger and Dr. White say they never received a response.Instead, the University of California announced that in 2011, the skeletons would be given to the La Posta Band, one of the Kumeyaay bands. Dr. Bettinger, Dr. Schoeninger and Dr. White sued to stop the transfer, arguing that the university had not made an adequate finding about the skeletons.Dr. Kemp of Washington State, who filed an amicus brief on behalf of the scientists, said the university had failed to meet the requirements of the repatriation act. The law hasnt been followed, he said.But the court arguments didnt directly address the universitys actions or the scientific importance of the skeletons. The University of California argued that the Kumeyaay bands had to be joined in the suit. Because the bands had tribal immunity, the university argued, the scientists couldnt sue them.A district court agreed and dismissed the suit. In 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also ruled against the scientists.In November, the scientists petitioned the Supreme Court to send the case back to the circuit court to consider whether tribal immunity can be invoked in claims arising under the repatriation act. The court rejected the petition with no explanation.Its a tragedy and a disgrace  a tragedy for science, and a disgrace for the court, said James McManis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.Mr. McManis said the decision could leave researchers at a disadvantage because tribes will be able to claim immunity in disputes over remains.The Supreme Courts denial marks the end of the road for the scientists. The task now, said Dorothy Alther, the lawyer for the Kumeyaay, is to contact the university and see what the next steps are for repatriation.Kate Moser, a spokeswoman for the University of California, said by email, We believe the university process has achieved a decision that is in accordance with both the law and our commitment to the respectful handling of human remains and associated artifacts.Dr. Mayes said she hoped that scientists and Native Americans would find more constructive ways to resolve such conflicts. When you end up in the courts, things get volatile and the conversation gets lost, she said. Only by having mutual respect will we have a positive situation in the future.While some tribes have rejected ancient DNA studies, others have decided to go forward with them. Mr. Banegas wouldnt rule out that possibility for the La Jolla remains once they come into Kumeyaay custody. Thats not off the table, he said. I wouldnt want anyone to think were closed off."}

{"text": "Lima, Peru  In the 1980s, Hugo Bustos was a photojournalist working in Ayacucho, a province in Peru that was then under martial law. The army was waging a brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoist rebels known as Sendero Luminoso, or the Shining Path. Mr. Bustoss work as a reporter made him an inconvenient witness to atrocities committed by both sides, and he had received numerous death threats.In 1988, he was ambushed in broad daylight by a military patrol. He was gunned down, and his body was disfigured by a grenade explosion, to intimidate others.More than 50 journalists have been murdered in Peru since the country returned to democracy in 1980; scarcely any case has been brought to justice. Yet the assassination of Hugo Bustos refused to go away; it was taken up first by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, and later by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.Progress in the investigation was glacial, but finally, more than a quarter-century after his death, a trial is taking place. But that is the least extraordinary thing about it, because the man in the dock could be the countrys next president.Gen. Daniel Urresti, known at the time of Mr. Bustoss killing by the pseudonym Capitn Arturo, was the intelligence chief at the army base in Huanta, Ayacucho. General Urresti was charged last year with ordering the journalists killing. If convicted, he faces 25 years in prison.At the same time, General Urresti has been chosen as the presidential candidate for the countrys ruling party, the Partido Nacionalista del Per, in the general elections scheduled for April 10.If this were not outlandish enough, General Urrestis running mate is Susana Villarn, a prominent human rights activist. Between 2002 and 2005, she served as commissioner of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  the very organization that helped bring the Urresti case to justice.Such unlikely stable mates are less uncommon than you might think: Parties are weak in Peru, and politicians have little compunction about switching sides. But even by Peruvian standards, Ms. Villarns vice-presidential run is shamelessly opportunistic. Mr. Bustoss widow, Margarita Patio, has accused Ms. Villarn of a betrayal that insults, vexes and outrages the families of the victims of grave violations of human rights.I knew Hugo Bustos well. We worked together in the mid-1980s in Huanta.Shortly after my colleague was killed, I became the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in 1990, along with Human Rights Watch and the Center for Justice and International Law, we got the Bustos case referred to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In 1997, the commission demanded that the Peruvian government begin an independent, impartial investigation so that those responsible could be brought to trial.The case remained stalled because President Alberto Fujimoris government had passed an amnesty law giving immunity to military personnel implicated in human rights abuses during the emergency. It was not until 2001, when a truth commission was appointed, that the Peruvian government finally agreed to investigate 165 cases, including the murder of Mr. Bustos. In 2007, a court sentenced two officers for the crime; but in 2009, one of those convicted implicated General Urresti as having taken part in the killing.General Urresti denies the charges, and insists that the prosecution is politically motivated  designed to block his presidential ambitions. For her part, Ms. Villarn has said that, despite past doubts, she is now convinced of her running mates innocence.I had never seen the general in person until last December, when I testified at his trial, but he has been a controversial public figure in Peru for some time. In 2014, he was appointed interior minister by President Ollanta Humala  who was himself an army officer during the dirty war  even though the general was already under investigation for the Bustos assassination. He lasted only eight months in that post  forced to resign after criticism of police brutality during protests last year. Yet General Urrestis combative style in television appearances made him popular.By perverse coincidence, the court is expected to give its verdict in the Urresti case just as Peruvians go to the polls in the first round of Aprils elections. Voters thus face not only the bizarre prospect of a presidential candidate who alternates campaigning with televised court appearances, but also the theoretical possibility of an elected president governing from prison.He is unlikely to win, but that may not be the prime objective of his candidacy. By anointing General Urresti as his political successor, Mr. Humala seemed to exculpate a suspect under indictment. Perus judges are not renowned for their independence and integrity; the presidential endorsement can certainly be seen as an attempt to influence the course of justice  and indeed could compromise the trials impartiality.The effort to install an ally in office may be a quid pro quo for the departing president. The first lady, Nadine Heredia, is under investigation by prosecutors on possible charges of money laundering undeclared campaign funds and of transferring millions of dollars into secret personal bank accounts overseas. (The president himself has immunity from prosecution, which could only be lifted by an act of Congress after he leaves office.) Mr. Humala will leave the presidency with miserably low approval ratings; his sponsorship of the candidacy of General Urresti could be seen as a desperate final attempt to shore up his political standing.It goes without saying that those who aspire to high public office should be free from suspicion of criminal conduct. That is clearly not so in the Urresti case, and that undermines Perus fragile democracy.Worse, General Urrestis candidacy seriously interferes with the administration of justice. That subverts Perus decades-long struggle to come to terms with its dark past of crimes against humanity."}
{"text": "ROME  President Obamas envoy to the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State said Monday that he had just completed a two-day weekend trip in Syria, the first known visit by a senior United States official since the coalition began airstrikes there in 2014.The envoy, Brett McGurk, said that he had spent a day touring Kobani, the small border town where Kurdish fighters backed by heavy American bombing repelled an invasion by Islamic State fighters almost exactly a year ago. Mr. McGurk said he had toured other places in northern Syria as well to evaluate the success of the campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Mr. McGurk and officials from the Defense Department met with what he described as a very diverse array of committed fighters in the anti-ISIL campaign, including Arab, Kurdish, Christian and Turkmen leaders, as part of a long-planned trip to the region.The news of Mr. McGurks trip was expected to draw a hostile reaction from the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, which regards such visits as a violation of Syrias sovereignty.Obviously, it was very sensitive, Mr. McGurk told reporters in Rome, where he, Secretary of State John Kerry and other coalition leaders will hold meetings starting Tuesday to plot the next stages of the effort against the Islamic State.Mr. McGurk said he had toured near the site where Kurdish forces received an airdrop of weapons and ammunition that Mr. Obama ordered in the fall 2014; seen the devastation in the center of the town where heavy fighting raged for months; and visited a memorial for Kurdish forces, as well as areas where people clearing rubble were still finding the remains of Islamic State fighters.It was quite moving and poignant to see these sites with our own eyes and to talk to the people who were in the fight, Mr. McGurk said.He said the visit had not been tied to, or timed to coincide with, the diplomatic talks beginning in Geneva, from which Syrias largest Kurdish groups have been excluded.Of course there were questions about that process, Mr. McGurk said. He would not comment on who had been invited to the talks, but said he and other American officials had restated their support for the United Nations resolution that endorsed the peace process, calling for a unified, multiethnic and multisectarian Syria.This is just the beginning of a process, and we emphasize the need for inclusivity, particularly as this process unfolds, he said.In Rome, Mr. Kerry will help lead talks that are expected to focus on how the American-led coalition can accelerate aspects of its fight against the Islamic State, said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the talks in advance.The meetings will focus in particular on Libya, especially the seaside city of Surt, where the Islamic State is increasingly trying to establish a base and attract fighters, the official said.Theres an awful lot of attention to it right now, he said."}

{"text": "The outsized role the Iowa caucuses play in the nomination process is, as almost everyone acknowledges, sort of stupid. But where does it come from? The immediate answer is that its about the news media, which seize on the Iowa results and use them to tell narratives that can, in turn, have a huge impact on fundraising and later voting.But why is this small, peculiar contest so influential in setting narratives? The answer, Id say, is that Iowa acts as a Schelling focal point.Schellings original examples involved something like two people told to find each other in New York. You might think this would be impossible, but people often succeed by choosing a psychologically salient time and place  say, the Empire State Building at noon. Whats interesting about this is that they may not even perceive this meeting point as a choice: person A has to do it because he or she thinks person B will do it, and vice versa.How does this apply to news coverage and punditry? Well, its obvious that the media have strong herding instincts; almost everyone wants to be somewhere close to the middle of the pack, telling the prevailing narrative. But there are many narratives that could, in fact, prevail. Partly thats because such narratives can be self-fulfilling, and partly its because actually being, you know, right isnt that important compared with being on top of the trend. So anything that gives special salience to a particular narrative can produce convergence on that narrative, even if everyone realizes that whats going on is basically stupid.Thus, should Rubios third-place finish in a small state really have caused him to shoot up so dramatically in market estimates of his probability of winning the GOP nomination? No, yet thats what happened.Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, the results were in all important respects a tie  but Clinton was a whisker ahead. Did that whisker matter? Im pretty sure it did, a lot. If Sanders had come in even slightly ahead, the news would have been full of Clinton-is-doomed reports. Instead, the coverage has, as best I can tell, been rather subdued. Everyone knows that a fraction of a point in the vote makes no objective difference; but everyone also knows that Iowa almost tied! isnt the same kind of focal point for Clinton doom stories as Clinton defeated! And so the coverage is radically different  and the betting markets have treated Iowa on the Democratic side as a non-event.Intellectually, I find this fascinating. But its one heck of a way to choose the future of the worlds greatest nation."}
{"text": "Murray Louis, the son of a Brooklyn baker who won acclaim as a brilliantly nimble dancer and a quirky and often surprising choreographer, died on Monday at his home in New York City. He was 89.His death was announced by the Nikolais/Louis Foundation for Dance, which did not specify the cause. Mr. Louis and the choreographer Alwin Nikolais had been artistic collaborators and companions for more than 40 years.As both a performer and a maker of dances, Mr. Louis was notable for his quick directional shifts, tiny darting gestures and unexpected contrasts between rigidity and stillness.With a mind as agile as his limbs, he was able to make separate parts of his body seem to move as if they were independent of one another. He could hold attention as easily with a waggling toe as he could with flurries of arm and torso movements.The effect of his quick and energy-rippling movements was such that he appeared to be under a flickering strobe light, the dance critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote in The New York Times in 1972 about his performance in a work called Intersection.Mr. Louiss bounciness helped make him a major comic artist.Comedy has to be in the nature of the choreographer, he said in an interview in 1979. It has to be a deep-rooted philosophy about living. It has to be an essential ingredient, a leavening agent in the dough of life.One of his best-known comedies was Junk Dances (1964), in which he and Phyllis Lamhut portrayed a down-and-out husband and wife  he, lazy and beer-drinking; she, zealously possessive  living in a trash-littered alley.That dance, both funny and poignant, could be interpreted as a commentary on the vicissitudes of marriage and the ways in which people litter their lives with emotional junk.Mr. Louis also staged works for the Royal Danish Ballet, the Hamburg Ballet, the Scottish Ballet, the Limn Dance Company and the Batsheva Dance Company. In 1975 and 1978, Rudolf Nureyev appeared as a guest artist with the Louis company, and Mr. Louis choreographed Vivace, a solo that showed Nureyevs flair to best advantage.Murray Louis Fuchs was born on Nov. 4, 1926, in Brooklyn, the son of Aaron Fuchs, a baker, and the former Rose Mintzer. He used to joke that as a child he was educated by the three Ms: Macys department store, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and 10-cent movie theaters.When Mr. Louis was 8, his father, impoverished by the Depression, placed him in an orphanage, where he stayed for several years and developed interests in music and literature. He graduated from Samuel Tilden High School in Brooklyn in 1943. With World War II underway, he soon entered the Office of Naval Intelligence in San Francisco, where he settled after his discharge in 1946.As a child, Mr. Louis had attended dance performances with a sister who was taking dance lessons. Enthralled by the art, he studied in San Francisco with Anna Halprin (then known as Ann Halprin), a prominent modern-dance teacher.Ms. Halprin encouraged him, suggesting that he study with the German-born choreographer Hanya Holm, who taught each summer at Colorado College. It was there that he met Mr. Nikolais, a young dancer from Connecticut.Mr. Louis went from Colorado to New York with Mr. Nikolais, who headed the dance program at the Henry Street Settlement Playhouse on the Lower East Side. At the time, Mr. Nikolais was beginning the choreographic experiments that would make him an internationally acclaimed master of mixed-media dance.Mr. Louis danced in Mr. Nikolaiss productions while finding time to study speech and theater at New York University. He soon made his own debut as a choreographer, and in 1953 he established his own dance company.The Henry Street Settlement became ever more crowded with dance activities, and by 1970 Mr. Nikolais and Mr. Louis realized that their companies had outgrown the premises. After that, they made their headquarters in various settings around Manhattan.Mr. Louis and Mr. Nikolais continued to maintain separate companies for many years, with some dancers moving back and forth between them. In 1987 they were the subject of a PBS documentary, Nik and Murray, part of the American Masters series. They merged their troupes for economic reasons in 1989, calling the new company Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance.A vivid conversationalist, Mr. Louis could combine lofty aesthetic thoughts with pungent comic observations about the foibles of dancers. The same combination of idealism and levity marked his two collections of essays, Inside Dance (1980) and On Dance (1992).In Inside Dance he declared that sweat is beautiful and remarked: All those who attend a dance performance find themselves at some point during the evening undressing the dancers with their eyes. Why not?He also reminisced about performing in everything from ornate opera houses to an Indian theater in which monkeys swung from the rafters. A fine cook himself, he observed in Inside Dance that cooking is like performing  you cant correct or repeat, once the heat is on.Mr. Louis was a recipient of the Dance Magazine Award, two Guggenheim fellowships and grants from the Rockefeller, Mellon and Ford foundations. He was a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French government.One of Mr. Louiss most memorable and moving works was created in 1994 as a memorial to Mr. Nikolais, his longtime collaborator and companion, who had died the previous year at 82. Mr. Louis titled it Alone.In the piece, Mr. Louis never moved far from one spot, making the empty stage around him seem like a vast void. He kept turning from side to side, as if expecting someone to enter, but no one was ever there. Nor was there anyone to touch when he spread his arms wide.From time to time, as he danced to recorded music by Astor Piazzolla, he clenched his fists, then bent over and drummed them quietly on the floor. Yet he always preserved his decorum and never exploded into rage or grief. Ending the solo, he slumped in dejection."}
{"text": "Oakland Raiders defensive end Justin Tuck said Monday that he was retiring from the N.F.L. after 11 seasons, including nine with the Giants.Ive had 11 great years, Tuck wrote on Facebook, and honestly I leave with very few regrets.Tuck, 32, spent his first nine seasons with the Giants, who picked him out of Notre Dame in the third round of the 2005 draft, and helped them win two Super Bowl titles. In his two seasons with Oakland, he was a mentor to the All-Pro pass rusher Khalil Mack.Justin Tuck is a leader and a true professional on and off the field, Raiders Coach Jack Del Rio said. His commitment to his teammates and the organization was awesome, and he was a pleasure to coach.Tuck was an All-Pro in 2008, when he had 12 sacks. He finished his career with 66  sacks, 22 forced fumbles, six fumble recoveries and three interceptions in 147 games. He missed the final 11 games this season with a torn pectoral muscle.Tuck thanked the owners of the Raiders and the Giants; his coaches, for teaching me about professionalism, preparation and the pursuit of perfection; and his teammates, for always going to battle with me each and every game day and being my brothers for life.Tuck was the Raiders nominee in 2015 for the N.F.L.s Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. He said he would concentrate on his charitable work with RUSH for Literacy, a program that has given more than 65,000 books to students across the country.BRONCOS IN MINOR ACCIDENT The Denver Broncos buses were involved in a minor accident after the team practiced at Stanford Stadium six days before the Super Bowl.Patrick Smyth, a team spokesman, said no one was injured in the accident in the southbound lanes of Route 101. He had no information on the cause. Afterward, the Broncos returned to their hotel in Santa Clara, Calif.Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware posted a photo on Twitter of the police investigating the accident. He wrote: To keep the day interesting, we have a small wreck. Looks like everyone is ok though.MANNING UNDECIDED ON FUTURE Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was succinct when asked during Super Bowl media day whether he would retire after Sundays game.I havent made my mind up, Manning said, and I dont see myself knowing that until after the seasons over.No matter what Manning decides, Denver does not want to lose his backup, Brock Osweiler, to free agency, said John Elway, the teams general manager and executive vice president for football operations.Were hoping to get something done with Brock this off-season, Elway said, adding: We needed both quarterbacks. We wouldnt be here without both of them.The Broncos and the Carolina Panthers spoke to the news media in San Jose, Calif., during the event, which the N.F.L. had moved to Monday night from its usual Tuesday daytime slot to give more fans a chance to watch live on cable.FOCUS ON LEASE IN OAKLAND With the Raiders prospects of moving to Los Angeles unclear, Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland said the teams main focus was on securing a lease to stay at O.co Coliseum for the 2016 season.The N.F.L. voted last month to allow the Rams to move to Inglewood, Calif., with an option for the Chargers to join them. The Chargers plan to spend the next year trying to secure a stadium deal to remain in San Diego, leaving the Raiders waiting to find out whether Los Angeles is an option for them in their long search for a new stadium.But before figuring out where they can play for the long term, the Raiders need to find a home for next season. The teams lease at the Coliseum is set to expire Feb. 17, and the Raiders have been in talks with the Joint Powers Authority, which runs the Coliseum, about extending the deal for one year.CARDINALS RE-SIGN TIGHT END The Arizona Cardinals re-signed tight end Darren Fells to a one-year contract.Fells, listed at 6 feet 7 inches and 281 pounds, appeared in 14 games this season, 12 as a starter. He had career highs of 21 receptions for 311 yards and three touchdowns.GOLDEN JOINS LIONS STAFF The former University of Miami coach Al Golden was hired as the tight ends coach of the Detroit Lions.

{"text": "GENEVA   Declaring the official beginning of the first Syria peace talks in two years, the United Nations mediator said Monday that they must show results to the countrys suffering civilians and he called on the outside powers that are helping drive the conflict to take steps to reduce the violence.The mediator, Staffan de Mistura, also said his most important objective now was to keep both sides talking  even if they are not talking directly to each other.Mr. de Mistura, a veteran Swedish-Italian diplomat with a four-decade career at the United Nations  and its third mediator in the Syria war  considered the negotiations underway after he met for two hours with members of Syrias opposition delegation at the organizations Geneva headquarters. He had met with the Syrian government representatives here on Friday.Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. de Mistura emphasized that he was paying attention to the calls by opposition representatives for an end to airstrikes, relief from sieges, and a release of political prisoners.We feel that they have a very strong point, because this is the voice of the Syrian people asking for that, he said. When I meet the Syrian people they tell me, Dont just have a conference; have also something that we can see and touch while you are meeting in Geneva.The talks here are the first attempt since January and February of 2014 to hold negotiations to end a war that has left more than a quarter-million people dead, displaced millions and entangled regional and global military powers. But unlike in the previous talks, the United States and Russia seem to have shown far more interest now in seeking an end to the war.Mr. de Mistura sought to emphasize on Monday that these outside powers must help make it possible for the Geneva negotiations to advance.They actually indicated that when the actual talks would start, they themselves will start helping in ensuring that there would be a discussion about an overall cease-fire in the Syrian conflict, Mr. de Mistura told reporters. If that takes place, that would be the strongest message for all Syrian people, wherever they are, about changes.Mr. de Mistura said he would meet with the Syrian government delegation again on Tuesday morning, followed by a separate meeting with the opposition.Earlier, opposition members emerging from the meeting said they had received a positive response from Mr. de Mistura about their demands in creating the basis for talks with the government: a release of political prisoners, the lifting of sieges on insurgent-held areas and a halt to airstrikes.But the opposition presented conflicting information about a list of detainees it wanted released. Salem al-Meslet, a spokesman for the oppositions High Negotiation Committee, said Sunday that his group had compiled 3,800 names. Another committee member, Hind Kabawat, said the group had a provided a list of 300 women and children.Mr. de Mistura told reporters that he had yet to receive any list. He said he was prepared to bring up such a list in negotiations as a way to show it was possible to achieve concrete results  what he described as one of the first signals that there is something different happening.He said the first immediate objective is to make sure the talks continue and that everyone is on board. Its crucial no one should be feeling excluded.The negotiations began amid further mayhem on the ground in Syria, where the death toll from a suicide attack on Sunday at a revered Shiite shrine near Damascus rose to 72, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on the shrine, Sayeda Zeinab, which heightened the potential to sharpen sectarian divides in the conflict. The Islamic State, which controls parts of Syria and Iraq and is widely reviled as a Sunni extremist terrorist organization, is not a party to the Geneva talks, nor does it have any interest in a political settlement.Reflecting the United States concerns about Islamic State expansion, the Obama administrations envoy to an American-led coalition that has been conducting airstrikes against the militant group slipped into northern Syria over the weekend to assess progress. The visit by the envoy, Brett McGurk, was the first by a senior United States official since the airstrikes began in 2014.Mr. McGurk said Monday that officials from the Defense Department had met with what he described as a very diverse array of committed fighters battling the Islamic State, including the Kurds, who have been excluded from the Syria peace talks. Mr. McGurks trip was expected to draw an angry reaction from the Syrian government, which regards such visits as a violation of its sovereignty.In Moadhamiyeh, a rebel-held suburb of Damascus hit by heavy bombardment on Sunday, doctors said investigations had shown that breathing difficulties in patients had been caused by dust and phosphates and not from a chemical weapon like chlorine, as initially feared.The Syrian government intensified its military advance even as it took steps to talk in Geneva. On Monday, a shell hit a school playground in the rebel-held town of Madaya, wounding several children, according to residents. The government has for months laid siege to Madaya, where some residents, including children, have starved because the delivery of emergency food and medicine has been obstructed. The United Nations has said the government is responsible for besieging roughly 187,000 people in rebel-held towns, while rebel groups are besieging two towns with around 12,000 residents.Until now, a cease-fire had held in Madaya and neighboring Zabadani, along with two government-held towns to the north that are surrounded by insurgents. The renewed military strikes on Madaya began in recent days, along with the talks in Geneva, as the warring parties jockeyed for leverage at the table.Umm Majd, a Madaya resident reached by telephone who gave only her nickname out of safety concerns, called on Riad Hijab, the head of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, to pull out of the Geneva talks because the cease-fire had been broken.What negotiations are they talking about? she said. Were living in starvation and blood. Before the conference there was a truce; after it we have shelling.She added: I plead with the opposition negotiators to pull out. What are you negotiating on? On our blood! Or our childrens blood. Both ways were dying.Her anger reflected the pressure on the opposition delegation to get something out of the talks. Opposition fighters have lately lost ground on the battlefield, mainly because of Russian airstrikes in support of government forces."}
{"text": "SURRY, Va.   Sam Edwards learned the art of curing country hams growing up here on the banks of the James River, from his father and grandfather before him. They taught him the secrets of salt and hickory smoke, and how to know when the meat is just the right shade of mahogany, ready to be aged like fine bourbon or wine.As the president and cure master of Edwards Virginia Smokehouse, the company his grandfather founded in 1926, Mr. Edwards, 59, has turned those lessons into haute cuisine. Food critics say his finest dry-cured aged ham rivals European classics  prosciutto from Italy, jamn Serrano from Spain. Surryano, Mr. Edwards called it  a clever marketing riff that brought rural Surry County a whiff of foodie fame.But two weeks ago, Edwards Virginia Smokehouse burned to the ground, in a spectacular conflagration that erupted while workers were on their lunchtime break. The fire caused no injuries, but it has left this close-knit community in shock, destroying a business that is deeply embedded in local lore and depriving rural Surry County of one of its largest employers outside the local nuclear plant.Its going to trickle down to everybody in town, said Mary Alma Savedge, who went to school with Mr. Edwardss sister. She and her husband own a tractor dealership and an auto-parts store; Mr. Edwards is a customer. She often buys lunch at the Edwards retail shop, closed for now, along with the rest of the business. Her son, a volunteer firefighter, helped fight the smokehouse fire. This is all intertwined, she said.The fire has had ripple effects far beyond Surry. Heritage farmers here and in the Midwest, who raise the rare-breed hogs Mr. Edwards requires for his specialty pork, have lost their biggest customer. A Brooklyn purveyor of sustainable meats who buys those farmers hogs and sells Mr. Edwards his pork is grappling with a break in his supply chain. Chefs from Washington to New York are busy adjusting their menus.We might bring on another American ham maker  we always like to rotate  but Edwards was a staple, said Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef at Momofuku Ssam Bar in Manhattan. Nothing can replace them.Mr. Edwards, a big man with an easy manner, has vowed to rebuild; he employs 35 people year-round and as many as 60 at Christmastime. He said he would pay them as long as he could.But while hams can be replaced, he said, some of what he lost cannot. The fire consumed priceless family artifacts: photographs, his grandfathers horse-drawn sleigh, a hand-cranked phone from the 1940s, the brass skeleton key to the original smokehouse his grandfather built.I look at it like, This is life, Mr. Edwards said last week after a quick tour of his property, where freezers had been reduced to mangled, twisted wrecks. Fire-blackened hams, picked over by dogs, sat in a pile out back. As heartbroken as we are, Im a plodder. Ill just keep going on, he said.Surry County, across the James River from Jamestown, is rich in American history; its courthouse has parchment deeds, written in Colonial-era cursive, that date to 1652. People in this region have been salt-curing country ham for centuries. Smithfield, the nations largest processor of pork, is in Smithfield, Va., just down the river.But for lovers of Edwards ham, Smithfield just wont do: The pork behemoth was bought by a Chinese company in 2013, creating a stir here. They might as well be in China, said Bess Richardson, who coordinates volunteers for the Surry County Historical Society.Mr. Edwards, born Samuel Wallace Edwards III, has deep roots here. A great-grandfather, Albert Jester, owned and ran the ferry that connected the county to Jamestown. His son-in-law was Mr. Edwardss grandfather, Samuel Wallace Edwards Sr., a ferry captain whose ham sandwiches so delighted customers that he went into business for himself.Longtime residents remember the elder Edwards carting his hogs on a tractor-driven wagon through the center of town.The younger Mr. Edwards took over the business in the early 1990s after his father, Samuel Wallace Edwards Jr., retired. He expanded it into specialty fare, marketing boutique foods like turducken, and became a respected figure in farm-to-table circles, said Patrick Martins, the founder of Heritage Foods USA, the Brooklyn company that sells Edwards Virginia Smokehouse its meat.Here in Surry, Tony Seward, a local farmer, gave up growing row crops in order to breed heritage black-and-white Berkshire hogs for Mr. Edwards. The men have known each other all their lives. Hes 90 percent of our market, Mr. Seward said, and hell be the one thats going to get me through this.The cause of the fire remains a mystery. Tyrone Franklin, the Surry County administrator, called it a nightmare for the local economy, adding that after the event, I didnt really get a whole lot of sleep.The fire broke out around 12:40 p.m. on a Tuesday. Mr. Edwards said he was in his office, on the phone. I smelled smoke, and it wasnt hickory smoke, he said. It smelled like plastic burning.He yelled to the office workers to get out  most others were at lunch  and called 911, he said, then rushed to the back of the property to cut off the propane gas tanks. He tried to dash back into the office to grab his computer hard drives, but it was too late. The offices were fully engulfed, he said.About 125 firefighters from 12 companies in the region spent two days rotating through Surry to fight the fire, said Mark Seward, the volunteer fire chief in Surry and a distant relative of Tony Sewards.He deemed it not suspicious; it will be up to insurance investigators to assess the damage and determine the cause.On a cold, gray afternoon last week, Mr. Edwards was holed up with those investigators, working out of the trailer that usually serves as the companys lunchroom and is now a makeshift office. His national sales manager was hunched over a laptop, filling orders. (The company, which typically ships about 50,000 hams a year, still has 14,000 in cold storage off site.) His plant superintendent was drawing up lists of equipment and inventory.His son, Samuel Wallace Edwards IV, who goes by Sammy, had been digging through the rubble with the maintenance manager, J. C. Judkins III, looking for the old smokehouse key. The younger Mr. Edwards, 26, cradled it in his hands. It was charred but intact.Mr. Judkins, a burly man in a knitted cap, fought back tears. Its not one of those things you can find the words for, he said. This is all extended family.Mr. Edwards is more stoic than tearful. Yet there is an image he cannot get out of his mind: a photograph taken as his company burned down. Part of the sign that read EDWARDS had dropped off, leaving only four letters: D-A-D-S.He wondered, he said, if his father and grandfather were talking to him. He could almost hear them saying, This was my place."}
{"text": "For months, mainstream Republicans have hoped that Donald Trumps support was a mirage  a combination of high name recognition, unsustainable news media coverage and support from irregular voters who might not show up in a primary.Tonight, theres reason to believe their hopes just might be well founded. Despite leading each of the last 10 Iowa polls, by an average of seven percentage points, Donald Trump was defeated by Ted Cruz, who currently leads, 28 percent to 24 percent, with 97 percent of precincts reporting in the Iowa caucuses. Marco Rubio is in a strong third place with 23 percent of the vote.In the end, Mr. Trump came closer to taking third than to winning.The result doesnt necessarily leave us much closer to knowing who the eventual nominee will be. It probably signals the beginning of a protracted, three-way fight for the nomination. But the loss raises the possibility that Mr. Trumps strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks.Mr. Trumps defeat wont necessarily derail his campaign, as some have speculated. He leads by a wide margin in polling in New Hampshire, so hell have a strong opportunity to rebound.Mr. Trumps voters also appeared to turn out in large numbers. Many speculated that he might fail to turn out his supporters, but the turnout in Iowa was higher than most analysts had forecast, with 167,000 votes counted as of now  swamping the 122,000 votes from 2012.Yet Mr. Trump still fell short. He lost among voters who decided over the last month by a wide margin, and he took third place among voters who had previously participated in the caucuses. Mr. Trump fared especially poorly among voters who decided over the last week  since his decision not to participate in the final presidential debate before the caucuses.For Mr. Cruz, the victory gives him a chance to forge a narrow but real path to the nomination. His strengths include strong support from self-described very conservative voters; perhaps the best organization in the race; and a strong fund-raising apparatus. He could fare relatively well in South Carolina in a few weeks, and across the South on Super Tuesday.But his path to the nomination is still not an easy one. He will face full-throated opposition from many prominent Republicans, as was the case here in Iowa. And Mr. Cruzs narrow victory was not especially impressive. It depended almost exclusively on strength among very conservative voters, who are vastly overrepresented in the Iowa caucuses. There was no primary state where very conservative voters represented a larger share of the electorate in 2012 than they did in Iowa.He won just 19 percent among somewhat conservative voters and a mere 9 percent of the moderate vote.Mr. Cruzs victory may bestow enough momentum to attract less conservative voters. But recent primary contests offer reason to be cautious about his prospects. Candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum never succeeded in broadening their appeal beyond their natural bases after winning Iowa, and Mr. Cruz will probably fall short of the nomination if he also cannot do so.Making it even harder for Mr. Cruz to broaden his appeal is Mr. Rubio. He finished in a strong third place, beating pre-election polls and nearly beating Mr. Trump for second in a state where Mr. Cruzs base is at its strongest.Whether Mr. Rubios showing will be enough to change the race in New Hampshire is hard to say  there isnt much precedent for a logjam like the one we have in New Hampshire. Four mainstream conservative candidates  John Kasich, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and Mr. Rubio  have all been clustered near 10 percent of the vote in New Hampshire surveys.If Mr. Rubios performance in Iowa bestows enough media coverage and credibility for him to break the deadlock, it would be a crucial turning point in the race. A strong Rubio showing in New Hampshire could push several mainstream candidates out, freeing up endorsements and fund-raising dollars that have sat on the sidelines. It would also allow him to consolidate the voters who have supported the mainstream candidates.It would bring about a true three-way race heading into South Carolina."}
{"text": "After hackers breached the computer network  of the U.C.L.A. medical center last summer, Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, and her office moved to shore up security across the university systems 10 campuses.Under a program initiated by Ms. Napolitano, the former secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, the university system began installing hardware and software in its data centers that would monitor patterns of digital traffic, like what websites are being visited by faculty and students, or telltale signs of cyber intruders. The program, which was begun with little notice or consultation, soon rankled a group of professors at one campus, Berkeley, which has a deep-seated ethos of academic freedom as the cradle of the free speech movement in the 1960s.In recent days, the professors have begun speaking out publicly about the issue. My primary concern is monitoring the private information of students and faculty in secret, said Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science at U.C. Berkeley. Im sure theres good intent. But I cant see a good reason for doing it.The resistance from Mr. Brewer and other professors at Berkeley, which is now becoming a public debate with the university systems administrators, raises the issue of how to define academic freedom in the age of online attacks. While some of the professors criticize the monitoring program as one that invades their privacy, the University of California has responded that privacy perishes in the absence of security.Its part of the larger challenge that fast-moving technology poses for social values. Every day, corporations, government agencies and universities must balance the need for computer security with the expected right to privacy of the people who use their networks. In different settings, there are different rules, expectations and levels of threat.Were really just starting to sort out the risks and rules for digital security and data collection and use, said Elana Zeide, a privacy expert at New York Universitys Information Law Institute.The Berkeley dispute stands out because of the place and personalities involved. U.C. Berkeley is not only a leading producer of computer science talent, but also a champion of the free speech movement, so any surveillance is regarded as particularly jarring. For her part, Ms. Napolitano, who joined the California university system in 2013, is no stranger to computer security policy, having served four years as the nations Homeland Security chief.The faculty group of 11 professors critical of the monitoring program said the university system enacted the program largely in private, with little transparency about what data is being collected. The monitoring could compromise and constrain academic freedom to research topics that some find objectionable, among other repercussions, they said. In a formal meeting with the University of Californias chief information officer in December, the professors asked for the program to be halted.On Jan. 19, Ms. Napolitanos staff responded in a five-page reply declining to do so; the letter was emailed last Friday to the entire Berkeley faculty and others. The University of California defended the security initiative as a measured step under the circumstances, and added that for cybersecurity purposes, a risk to what appears to be an isolated system at only one location may in some circumstances create risk across locations or units.The university said Ms. Napolitano was not available for an interview. Steve Montiel, press secretary for the presidents office, said he was not aware of any complaints from other campuses about the monitoring program.The roots of the dispute stretch back to the attack disclosed last July at the UCLA Health System, which potentially put the private information of 4.5 million patients at risk. In an interview on Monday, Tom Andriola, chief information officer of the University of California system, said after the medical center attack the system administrators had to move swiftly to insure against similar breaches.Some faculty members, he acknowledged, may have understandably felt there was too little consultation. But Mr. Andriola said that moving forward the faculty will be deeply involved.Last Oct. 27, the presidents office issued a short statement describing the new data-tracking program, called the Coordinated Monitoring and Threat Response Initiative. The programs hardware and software are being supplied and run by an outside contractor, Fidelis Cybersecurity. The presidents office has set up a Cyber-Risk Governance Committee to oversee programs like the data center monitoring, which includes a Berkeley representative, though not a tenured faculty member.The faculty members learned about the monitoring program from people who knew it was being put in place, but who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose the information. Once alerted, the faculty group became concerned.Just what data is being collected and stored in the monitoring program is unclear. The presidents office has not explained the data collection and data use practices of the program, the Berkeley professors said.The issue here is the lack of transparency and the lack of shared governance, said Greg Niemeyer, director of the Berkeley Center for New Media.Lawsuits stemming from the U.C.L.A. breach last summer prevent the presidents office from disclosing details of the monitoring program, according to Rachael Nava, chief operating officer of University of California system, who signed the Jan. 19 letter. In the letter, she said the legal constraint was regrettable because she could not share additional information that might correct some of these misimpressions.Mr. Andriola emphasized that the program monitored network traffic rather than mining the contents of email messages, for example. This is not spyware, he said.The standard practice at Berkeley, the professors said, had been to immediately delete the so-called log files that show the websites a person had visited or the origin and destination of email traffic. The exception, they said, was if a pattern of network use signaled the suspicion of data theft or a hacker attack. So in the past, they said, the monitoring in Berkeley data centers was light-touch, and targeted.The worry, Mr. Niemeyer said, is that if network traffic logs are stored, they could be subject to subpoena. An example, he said, might be if a foreign student from China or some other autocratic nation is visiting the websites of dissidents or emailing them.Before, we could just say that we just dont have the records, Mr. Niemeyer said. Now, its not clear we wouldnt or the third-party company wouldnt. That is the kind of scenario that is not unlikely.Other examples, he said, might be constraints on academic freedom to research topics that some object to  say, pornography or Satan worship. Such inquiries, in theory, could become the target of congressional investigations into the use of taxpayers money that supports a major public university like Berkeley.In December, the Berkeley faculty group met with Mr. Andriola to voice their concerns and call for a stop to the monitoring program. In the Jan. 19 letter from Ms. Nava, she stressed the seriousness of the threat. The digital attacks can sometimes jump from one network to another, she said.The Berkeley professors remain unpersuaded. Corporations often monitor the online behavior of their employees, but American universities have a different tradition.Its a pretty settled point that universities go out of their way not to monitor students, faculty and staff, said Jeffrey MacKie-Mason, the university librarian at Berkeley. Yes, sometimes security concerns trump privacy. But its something we should have an informed discussion about.Mr. Andriola said he welcomed a dialogue with the university faculty as a whole. This is not a technology issue, he said. It is about how to strike a balance between being a very open university while still protecting the assets of the university from nefarious actors."}
{"text": "Q. If I wanted to set up my own website where I can upload pictures and videos for my family and friends to see, where would I start? Obviously, I am not talking about a YouTube account, but something like a site with my own name. Is there an easy way to do this?A. Creating your own website is a fairly streamlined process and you do not need a lot of technical prowess to get it up and running. You do need to get an available domain name for your future site, but registration companies like register.com and namecheap.com will set up the domain name of your choice for a small fee.Many of these same companies will also sell you package deals, so along with the domain name, you get server space to host your site, tools to create your own webpages and tech support. For example, register.com has such a Do-It-Myself Web Design package that starts at $12.95 a month and includes a few other perks like an email account for the site.Running your own website for family and friends to visit gives you a lot of control, but it can also be a lot of work. If you mainly want to share family news, videos and photos, options like Shutterfly Share, Zalongo or Family Crossings provide the server space and tools you need, and they are geared more for smaller groups of viewers.If most of your participants are on Facebook, you can also create a secret Facebook group to share photos and videos privately among members. Depending on the software and services your family members use, sharing content through sites like iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and similar sites may also work.Keep one thing in mind for whichever method you select. Because you are sharing private family photos and details, consider using a site or service that lets you easily password-protect your content from people outside the group."}
{"text": "HONOLULU  A thousand miles south of Hawaii, the air at 45,000 feet above the equatorial Pacific was a shimmering gumbo of thick storm clouds and icy cirrus haze, all cooked up by the overheated waters below.In a Gulfstream jet more accustomed to hunting hurricanes in the Atlantic, researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were cruising this desolate stretch of tropical ocean where the northern and southern trade winds meet. Its an area that becalmed sailors have long called the doldrums, but this year it is anything but quiet.This is the heart of the strongest El Nio in a generation, one that is pumping moisture and energy into the atmosphere and, as a result, roiling weather worldwide.The plane, with 11 people aboard including a journalist, made its way Friday on a long westward tack, steering clear of the worst of the disturbed air to the south. Every 10 minutes, on a countdown from Mike Holmes, one of two flight directors, technicians in the rear released an instrument package out through a narrow tube in the floor. Slowed by a small parachute, the devices, called dropsondes, fell toward the water, transmitting wind speed and direction, humidity and other atmospheric data back to the plane continuously on the way down.The information, parsed by scientists and fed into weather models, may improve forecasting of El Nios effect on weather by helping researchers better understand what happens here, at the starting point.One of the most important questions is to resolve how well our current weather and climate models do in representing the tropical atmospheres response to an El Nio, said Randall Dole, a senior scientist at NOAAs Earth System Research Laboratory and one of the lead researchers on the project. Its the first link in the chain.An El Nio forms about every two to seven years, when the surface winds that typically blow from east to west slacken. As a result, warm water that normally pools along the Equator in the western Pacific piles up toward the east instead. Because of this shift, the expanse of water  which in this El Nio has made the central and eastern Pacific as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than usual  acts as a heat engine, affecting the jet streams that blow at high altitudes.That, in turn, can bring more winter rain to the lower third of the United States and dry conditions to southern Africa, among El Nios many possible effects.Aided by vast processing power and better data, scientists have improved the ability of their models to predict when an El Nio will occur and how strong it will be. As early as last June, the consensus among forecasters using models developed by NOAA, as well as other American and foreign agencies and academic institutions, was that a strong El Nio would develop later in the year, and it did.But scientists have been less successful at forecasting an El Nios effect on weather. This year, for instance, most models have been less certain about what it will mean for parched California. So far, much of the state has received higher than usual precipitation, but it is still unclear whether Southern California, especially, will be deluged as much as it was during the last strong El Nio, in 1997-98.Anthony Barnston, the chief forecaster at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University, who has studied the accuracy of El Nio modeling, said that so-called dynamical models, which simulate the physics of the real world, have recently done a better job in predicting whether an El Nio will occur than statistical models, which rely on comparisons of historical data.With a dynamical model, Dr. Barnston said, data representing current conditions is fed into the model, and off it goes. You plug it in and you crank it forward in time, he said. This can be done dozens of times  or as often as money will allow  tweaking the data slightly each time and averaging the outcomes.With any model, good data is crucial. El Nio models have been helped by the development of satellites and networks of buoys that can measure sea-surface temperatures and other ocean characteristics.When it comes to forecasting El Nios weather effects, however, good data can be harder to come by. Thats where the NOAA research project aims to help, by studying a key process in the El Nio-weather connection: deep tropical convection.The clouds that the NOAA jet cruised past on Friday were a result of this process, in which air over the warm El Nio waters picks up heat and moisture and rises tens of thousands of feet. When the air reaches high altitudes  about the flight level of the Gulfstream  the moisture condenses into droplets, releasing energy in the form of heat and creating winds that flow outward.Scientists know that the energy released can induce a kind of ripple in a jet stream, a wave that as it travels along can affect weather in disparate regions around the world. And they know that the winds that are generated can add a kick to a jet stream, strengthening it. Thats a major reason California and much of the southern United States tend to be wetter in an El Nio; the winds from convection strengthen the jet stream enough that it reaches California and beyond.But to study convection during an El Nio, data must be collected from the atmosphere as well as the sea surface. Thats a daunting task, because the convection occurs in one of the most remote areas of the planet. As a result, there has been little actual data on convection during El Nio events, Dr. Dole said, and most models, including NOAAs own, have had to make what amount to educated guesses about the details of the process.Our strong suspicion is that our models have major errors in reproducing some of these responses, he said. The only way we can tell is by going out and doing observations.When forecasters last year began to predict a strong El Nio, the NOAA scientists saw an opportunity and started making plans for a rapid-response program of research.Dr. Dole estimated that it would normally take two or three years to put together a program they assembled in about six months.In a way, he said, they were helped by the developing El Nio, which suppressed hurricane activity in the Atlantic last fall. The Gulfstream flew fewer missions and the available flight hours, as well as extra dropsondes, were transferred to the project.In addition to the jet  which is also equipped with Doppler radar to study wind  the program is launching other sondes, from a ship and a small atoll near the Equator. A large remotely piloted aircraft from NASA, the Global Hawk, has also been enlisted to study the Pacific between Hawaii and the mainland.The Gulfstream flight Friday was the researchers fourth so far, out of nearly two dozen planned over the next month. The day began at Honolulu International Airport five hours before the 11:30 a.m. takeoff when Ryan Spackman, the other lead investigator, and NOAA colleagues sat down for a weather briefing with Dr. Dole and other scientists at the agencys offices in Boulder, Colo.The original plan was to fly due south from Honolulu and around an area of convection  a cell in meteorological terms  near the Equator. But when the planes three pilots arrived for their briefing several hours later, the plan was changed out of safety concerns. There was a risk they would have no way to get back from the south side of the convection area without going through a storm, and the Gulfstream, unlike NOAAs other hurricane-hunting planes, cannot do that.In the end, scientists and aviators agreed they would fly a long leg along the north fringe of the convection area.The plan called for 30 dropsondes, and the crew released a few during the long flight down to the convection zone and then picked up the pace as the plane headed west.A brief whooshing noise was the only indication that a sonde had been released. The cylindrical tubes, which weigh about a pound, are simply sucked out of the plane by the difference in pressure between the cabin and the outside air, and quickly sink when they hit the water about 15 minutes later.Data starts streaming in almost immediately once a dropsonde leaves the plane, and is displayed in real time on a few of the several computer screens in the cabin, including the one manned by Richard Henning, the other flight director. Mr. Henning, who like Mr. Holmes is a meteorologist, makes sure the data is clean  with his practiced eye, he can quickly tell if a sensor has malfunctioned or the sonde has otherwise provided unusable data  before sending it off in several forms, including a condensed format that can be immediately fed into models around the world.Elsewhere in the cabin, crew members made sure all the planes electronics were running properly and monitored the Doppler radar. Mr. Holmes, Dr. Spackman and the aircraft commander, Ron Moyers, talked from time to time about course changes designed to get closer to the convection to obtain better data.After two and a half hours of flying west, it was time to turn to the northeast and head back to Honolulu, still three hours away. The pace of work slowed again, with only a few dropsondes left to release.Mr. Henning and Dr. Spackman took time to look over some of the dropsonde data. They saw winds coming out of the top of the convective cell and blowing toward the northwest. Earths rotation, Dr. Spackman said, would make that wind curve to the east, where it would no doubt join up with the Pacific jet stream that was affecting the West Coast.Dr. Spackman seemed pleased despite the change in plans. We did a lot of good science today, he said."}
{"text": "A Brooklyn teenager who opened fire on a crowded New York City bus during a gang turf war two years ago, killing a 39-year-old immigrant who was an unintended target, was convicted of second-degree murder on Monday.A jury delivered the guilty verdict against the boy, Kahton Anderson, 15, in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Justice Dineen Riviezzo set sentencing for Mr. Anderson, who faces 15 years to life in prison, for Feb. 18Mr. Anderson, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, was retried in the March 2014 death of Angel Rojas, a shooting that raised concerns about how a petty turf war involving teenagers could lead to such random, deadly violence. An earlier jury could not reach a decision last year on a murder charge but found him guilty on some lesser charges, including criminal possession of a weapon.The defense and prosecutors in the new trial agreed that Mr. Anderson pulled out a revolver and opened fire on three rival gang members aboard a crowded B15 bus during the evening rush. He fired a single shot that missed the intended targets and struck Mr. Rojas, a fruit vendor, in the back of the head.The retrial focused on Mr. Andersons state of mind, and whether he believed rival gang members were about to attack him.Mr. Anderson, a member of the gang Stack Money Goons, argued that he had acted in self-defense against the other gang that he said had shot at him earlier in the day. He said he had taken the bus to avoid stepping on turf belonging to the Twan House gang, but he encountered three members on the bus, where they approached him. He pulled a silver .357 revolver from his backpack and fired a single shot.The jurors did not accept that defense on Monday, convicting him of second-degree attempted murder, first-degree attempted assault, first-degree reckless endangerment and first-degree criminal use of a firearm. The rival gang members had fled the bus after the shooting, and Mr. Anderson had pursued them and continued firing until he emptied the gun.At the time of the shooting, Mr. Anderson was an eighth grader at Middle School 57, where he was a popular student and a forward on the basketball team. He lived in an apartment with his mother, who is a United States Postal Service letter carrier.Mr. Rojas, a Dominican immigrant, was working two jobs and was on his way home when he was shot. He was married and had a son and a daughter.His widow regularly attended both of Mr. Andersons trials and testified against him.Angel Rojas was an innocent and hardworking man who came to our country to pursue the American dream, Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, said in a statement. All of that was tragically and brutally taken away from him in an instant by a teenager caught up in the gang culture and the random and senseless gun violence that it spawns. Hopefully, this conviction will bring his shattered family some solace."}
{"text": "PELLA, Iowa   When Dan Spotten opened the doors to Pella High School shortly after 5 p.m. to allow voters from six Republican precincts to cast ballots in the Iowa caucuses, he was committed to running a tight ship.Mr. Spotten, the site chairman for the caucuses, owns a sign-making company, and he made color-coded signs directing people to register at tables for each voting precinct, sit together, fill out color-coded ballots and drop them into colored buckets.He planned to keep the speakers for each candidate to a tight schedule. I am not fussing around, he said. Theyve got two minutes. Im going to line em up like cattle.Mr. Spotten predicted a large turnout, as many as 2,000 people compared with the 1,260 who caucused four years ago. There would be a surge for Donald J. Trump, he said, but also for other first-timers who wanted to stop Mr. Trump.Most people I know are apolitical, he said. They dont care. With Trump involved now, a lot people are caring. Either theyre for Trump or against Trump.With the large influx, Mr. Spottens pledge to move things along quickly began to unravel.5:30 P.M. It was clear that the early arrivals included many first-time caucusgoers. But there was no unanimity about their support. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas seemed to have an edge in this socially conservative community, and the campaign sent his wife, Heidi Cruz, to be his designated speaker.Joel Merrill, 61, a forklift mechanic who had never caucused before, said: There are a number of candidates I like and one in particular I dont like  Trump. Im going to go with Cruz.Mike Rottier, a hardware store owner, said he had been leaning toward Mr. Cruz but disliked his opposition to federal support of ethanol, which is made out of corn, a mainstay of the Iowa economy.I saw something on Facebook about Rubios background, how he came up poor, he said of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. That sounds good.Steve Latta, who works for a farm machinery manufacturer, planned to vote for Mr. Trump. Hes going to at least try to stick up for America, he said.Jay Schelhaas, a community college professor, said he liked Mr. Rubios and Mr. Cruzs performance in the last debate in Des Moines, in which Mr. Trump did not participate.Im still up in the air between the two, he said. Listening to their representatives tonight might make the difference.6:15 P.M. Mr. Spotten said the influx was just beginning. In about 20 minutes this place is going to get stupid, he said.7 P.M. In the West Gym, where voters from four precincts filled two walls of bleachers, Mr. Spotten said there were still hundreds waiting to sign in. He pushed back the official start 10 minutes, and urged people to squeeze together to make room for your neighbors.How many of you, is this your first caucus? Mr. Spotten, who wore a black T-shirt and had tattoos on both arms, asked. About 30 percent raised a hand.After the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of Onward Christian Soldiers, speakers were introduced. Mr. Spotten in the end did not herd them through. Many speakers ran over. Mrs. Cruz added a dash of celebrity as she rose to speak for her husband.Ted was raised on the Bible and the Constitution. She emphasized his unwavering conservative principles and his faith. Ted gets his confidence and his strength from our God, our father, she said. I can tell you as his wife of 14 and one-half years, Ted will never lie to you.After she spoke, a volunteer led her to the second gym to repeat the speech. She put her arm in his like a prom escort.7:49 P.M. Working his way through the candidates in alphabetical order, Mr. Spotten came to Jim Gilmore, the former Virginia governor. Would anybody like to speak for Jim Gilmore? Mr. Spotten asked. No one raised a hand. Very well, moving right along, the chairman said.8 P.M. Representative Austin Scott of Georgia, wearing a camel sport coat, spoke for Mr. Rubio. The threat of ISIS wouldnt be a threat today if Marco had been our president, he said in a thick Southern accent.He promised that Mr. Rubio would win Florida in a general election, and that he would inspire Americans who have never voted Republican.8:32 P.M. Buckets filled with ballots were taken to the cafeteria, where volunteers counted them, one person reading off a name and a second writing hash marks for each candidate on a sheet of paper. The unofficial total turnout was 1,776. It was a big night for Mr. Cruz (558), a big surge for Mr. Rubio (432) and a disappointment for Mr. Trump (225). Ben Carson came in fourth with 213. By the time the totals were sent into the state party, almost all the voters had gone home."}
{"text": "If there is a holy grail of weight loss, it would be a program that allows someone to shed fat rapidly while hanging on to or even augmenting muscle. Ideally, it would also be easy.A new study describes a workout and diet regimen that accomplishes two of those goals remarkably well. But it may not be so easy.For most of us, losing weight and keeping it off is difficult. If you consume fewer calories than your body requires for daily operations, it turns to internal sources of fuel. Those sources consist of body fat and lean tissue, meaning muscle. When someone on a diet drops a pound of body mass (a measure that does not include water), much of that pound consists of fat. But about a third or more can be made up of muscle.The problem with losing muscle is that, unlike fat tissue, muscle burns calories. Having less muscle means a lower resting metabolic rate, so you burn fewer calories throughout the day. Losing muscle may also discourage physical activity, which is important for maintaining weight loss.So researchers have long been looking for weight loss programs that produce hefty amounts of fat loss but diminish any decline in muscle.For scientists at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, that goal seemed to demand a high dose of protein and also plenty of exercise.As the scientists knew, amino acids in protein help muscle tissue to maintain itself and to grow. Many past studies have suggested that low-calorie but high-protein diets can result in less muscle loss than the same number of calories but less protein.However, the best dosage of protein in these circumstances has remained unclear, as has the role, if any, for exercise.So for the new study, which was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the McMaster researchers rounded up 40 overweight young men who were willing to commit to an intensive weight-loss program and divided them in half.All of the young men began a diet in which their daily calories were cut by about 40 percent (compared to what they needed to maintain weight). But for half of them, this consisted of about 15 percent protein, 35 percent fat and 50 percent carbohydrates.The other 20 volunteers began a diet that mimicked that of the first group, except that theirs swapped the protein and fat ratios, so that 35 percent of their calories came from protein and 15 percent from fat. Over all, their protein intake was about three times the recommended dietary allowance for most people.The researchers handled that switch by changing the make-up of a supplied drink. In the low-protein group, the beverage contained high-fat milk and no added protein. For the others, it consisted of low-fat milk and a large dollop of whey protein.All of the men also began a grueling workout routine. Six days a week they reported to the exercise lab and completed a strenuous full-body weight training circuit, high-intensity intervals, or a series of explosive jumps and other exercises known as plyometric training.The diet and exercise routine continued for four weeks, by the end of which time, those guys were done, said Stuart Phillips, who holds a research chair in skeletal muscle health at McMaster University and oversaw the study. All they could talk about was food.The routine had succeeded in incinerating pounds from all of the participants. The men in both groups weighed about 11 or 12 pounds less, on average.But it was the composition of that weight loss that differed. Unlike most people on low-calorie diets, the men on the high-protein regimen had actually gained muscle during the month, as much as three pounds of it. So in these men, almost all of the 11 or 12 pounds they had lost over all had been fat.These results strongly suggest that extra protein is advisable during weight loss, Dr. Phillips said, to avoid stripping yourself of muscle.But exercise is also key, Dr. Phillips continued, particularly weight training, since it is known to build muscle. Even the men on the lower-protein diet lost little muscle mass, he pointed out, which was unexpected and almost certainly due, he and his colleagues concluded, to exercise.Of course, by the end of the month, none of the men wished to continue. This type of extreme calorie cutting combined with intense exercise is not a sustainable program in the long term, Dr. Phillips said. Its more a kind of boot camp, he said, manageable in the short term by people who are very committed and generally very healthy.He and his colleagues plan to conduct follow-up experiments to find a more realistic and sustainable program. They plan, too, to study female volunteers and play around with the diets composition, to establish definitively that it is extra protein and not reduced fat that promotes muscle gains.In the meantime, for those hoping to become thin but not puny, various apps allow you to determine the percentage of your diet that is composed of protein. If it is below 10 or 15 percent, you might want to shift calories from fat to protein.

{"text": "If you cant beat em, join em. Unilever, the global food and consumer products giant, said on Tuesday that it would begin selling an eggless sandwich spread.Hellmanns Carefully Crafted Dressing and Sandwich Spread will make its debut a little more than a year after Unilever sued Hampton Creek, the upstart food company whose Just Mayo eggless spread has dented the market share of conventional mayonnaises.We talk with our fans all the time, share ideas and begin to have idea of what theyre interested in, said Russel Lilly, marketing director at Hellmanns, which is known as Best Foods west of the Rockies. There was clearly a lot of excitement and interest from our fans and thats why we decided to take this step.Carefully Crafted will hit shelves in the middle of this month, together with three organic versions  Original, Roasted Garlic and Spicy Chipotle  of Hellmanns mayonnaise.Unilevers retail sales of mayonnaise dropped to $839 million last year, or 46.6 percent of the United States market, from a peak of $884 million in 2012, and Krafts have eroded even more, according to data from Euromonitor.Over the same time, sales of what Euromonitor calls other brands, which includes Just Mayo, have climbed steadily to $111.7 million, up from $61.3 million in 2012.According to data from IRI, sales of Hampton Creeks Just Mayo product more than tripled last year, as the company gained broader distribution. IRI put sales at a little more than $8 million.In late 2014, Unilever sued Hampton Creek, charging that the cracked egg image and use of the word mayo on labels for its spread product violated federal regulations that define foods. Unilever then had to scramble to change language on some of its own websites that referred to nonmayonnaise products as mayonnaise, and it eventually dropped the suit.The Food and Drug Administration then picked up the baton last August, essentially making the same charges that Unilever had in its lawsuit. But after negotiations that led to some minor adjustments to the label, Hampton Creek was allowed to keep the brand name Just Mayo on its product.The company also makes Just Cookies; supplies university, school and corporate cafeterias through an alliance with the Compass Group; and sells its egg protein to manufacturers for use in their products.Josh Tetrick, the founder of Hampton Creek, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that Unilever had said it was working toward plant-based replacements for proteins normally derived from meat. He said Unilever had not bought any of Hampton Creeks egg substitute.Mr. Tetrick said he welcomed the competition from Unilevers new product. The whole point of Hampton Creek is to bring its way of doing things to the entire food system, he said. Theres no way a single company can do it alone, so Im glad Unilever is doing this and I hope Kraft and Nestl and many others follow suit.As for whether Unilever might now dent Just Mayos sales, Mr. Tetrick said, Weve got a pretty good head start."}
{"text": "HENNIKER, N.H.  Ted Cruz is feeling the Bern. Sort of.At a town-hall-style event in New Hampshire on Wednesday, the Texas senator identified Bernie Sanders as an unlikely kindred spirit while describing the failings of Washington.Actually in diagnosing the problem, I agree in many ways with Bernie Sanders, Mr. Cruz said. Media folks, theyre very puzzled when they say, Gosh, Ted, you sound exactly like Bernie saying it is all big money and lobbyists and corruption. Well, you know what? Thats right, it is. Washington is corrupt.Mr. Cruz repeated a familiar campaign refrain: that the countrys greatest political divide is not between Republicans and Democrats but between career politicians from both parties and the people they represent.Eventually, Mr. Cruz did get around to the caveat: He and Mr. Sanders, whose platform includes myriad tax hikes and tuition-free college, disagree on virtually every policy remedy.His solution is, So we need even more Washington, we need the government to take over even more of the economy and our lives, Mr. Cruz said. I think that solution is nuts.Mr. Sanders has long been a target of gentle ridicule from Mr. Cruz on the stump, though his most pointed vitriol is almost always reserved for President Obama and Hillary Clinton.After his victory in the Iowa caucuses victory on Monday, Mr. Cruz allowed himself a peek at the vote tallies across the aisle.The Democrats here seem to be in a virtual tie between one candidate who admits hes a socialist and the other candidate who pretends shes not, Mr. Cruz said to laughs. I wish them both luck."}
{"text": "Shortly before he died in July, the former N.F.L. quarterback Ken Stabler was rushed away by doctors, desperate to save him, in a Mississippi hospital. His longtime partner followed the scrum to the elevator, holding his hand. She told him that she loved him. Stabler said that he loved her, too.I turned my head to wipe the tears away, his partner, Kim Bush, said recently. And when I looked back, he looked me dead in the eye and said, Im tired. They were the last words anyone in Stablers family heard him speak.I knew that was it, Bush said. I knew that he had gone the distance. Because Kenny Stabler was never tired.The day after Stabler died on July 8, a victim of colon cancer at 69, his brain was removed during an autopsy and ferried to scientists in Massachusetts. It weighed 1,318 grams, or just under three pounds. Over several months, it was dissected for clues, as Stabler had wished, to help those left behind understand why his mind seemed to slip so precipitously in his final years.On the neuropathologists scale of 1 to 4, Stabler had high Stage 3 chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the degenerative brain disease believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head, according to researchers at Boston University. The relationship between blows to the head and brain degeneration is still poorly understood, and some experts caution that other factors, like unrelated mood problems or dementia, might contribute to symptoms experienced by those later found to have had C.T.E.Stabler, well known by his nickname, the Snake (Hed run 200 yards to score from 20 yards out, Stablers junior high school coach told Sports Illustrated in 1977), is one of the highest-profile football players to have had C.T.E. The list, now well over 100 names long, includes at least seven members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, including Junior Seau, Mike Webster and Frank Gifford.Few, if any, had the free-spirited charisma of Stabler, a longhaired, left-handed quarterback from Alabama who personified the renegade Oakland Raiders in the 1970s. Stabler was the N.F.L.s most valuable player in 1974 and led the Raiders to their first Super Bowl title two seasons later. He ended his 15-year N.F.L. career with the New Orleans Saints in 1984.He had moderately severe disease, said Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a professor of neurology and pathology at Boston University School of Medicine, who conducted the examination. Pretty classic. It may be surprising since he was a quarterback, but certainly the lesions were widespread, and they were quite severe, affecting many regions of the brain.Quarterbacks are provided more protection from hits than most football players. An offensive lines purpose is, in part, to protect the quarterback, and leagues like the N.F.L. have special rules to discourage severe blows to players in the most important position on the field.But Stablers diagnosis further suggests that no position in football, except perhaps kicker, is immune from progressive brain damage linked to hits to the head, both concussive and subconcussive.Stabler is the seventh former N.F.L. quarterback found to have had C.T.E. by Boston University, which says it has found C.T.E. in 90 of the 94 former N.F.L. players it has examined, including the former Giants safety Tyler Sash, who died at 27 in September and whose diagnosis was made public last week.On Wednesday, the family of another Super Bowl quarterback, Earl Morrall, told The New York Times that Morrall was found to have Stage 4 C.T.E. after his death in 2014 at age 79.Morrall was best known as a trustworthy backup to two future Hall of Fame players, Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts and Bob Griese of the Miami Dolphins.With Unitas missing most of the 1968 season with an injury, Morrall led the Colts to a 13-1 record and two postseason victories. But he threw three interceptions in a stunning upset loss to Joe Namath and the Jets in Super Bowl III.In 1972, at age 38 and with his familiar crew cut, Morrall took over for an injured Griese in the fifth game of the season and helped lead the Dolphins to a perfect record. Griese returned in the conference championship game and played in Miamis Super Bowl victory to cap a 17-0 season, still the only perfect record of the 50-year Super Bowl era.Morrall was an all-American at Michigan State and drafted second over all in 1956 by the San Francisco 49ers. He played 21 seasons with six N.F.L. teams. When he died in April 2014, his family said that the cause was complications from Parkinsons disease.Morralls son Matthew confirmed that the family was told Morrall had C.T.E.Because C.T.E. can be diagnosed only posthumously, and most brains are not examined for the disease, incidence rates among athletes and nonathletes are difficult to ascertain. A study by the Mayo Clinic, released in the fall, found C.T.E. in 21 of 66 men who played contact sports (mostly football), but found no traces of the disease in 198 other brains of men who had no exposure to contact sports. The Mayo Clinic said it was unclear whether brain changes in the athletes caused any changes in behavior.Scientists are quick to note that they do not understand why some football players get C.T.E. and others do not.But the disease, once thought to afflict mostly boxers, has been found in recent years in deceased athletes who have played soccer, rugby and even baseball.Most brains are donated by families hoping to understand why their loved ones cognitive functions declined in later years. Symptoms of C.T.E. are similar to those of Alzheimers disease or dementia, including memory loss, confusion, impulsiveness and depression.On some days, when he wasnt feeling extremely bad, things were kind of normal, Bush said. But on other days it was intense. I think Kennys head rattled for about 10 years.For decades, the N.F.L. rebutted research by independent experts that connected brain trauma to long-term cognitive impairment. Only in recent years, long after Stablers career ended, has the league begun to publicly acknowledge it has a problem.Stabler is a finalist for this years Pro Football Hall of Fame class, to be voted upon by sportswriters and announced on Saturday, the day before Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, Calif.He was a finalist three times before, the last in 2003, and his nomination regularly led to sturdy debate. This time, Stabler was selected posthumously as a senior finalist, along with Dick Stanfel, an offensive lineman who died at 87 in June.Like those of other famous players, Stablers long career may have bolstered his case for the Hall, but it also made him more susceptible to long-term brain disease.The very severity of the disease, at least that were seeing in American football players, seems to correlate with the duration of play, McKee said. The longer they play, the more severe we see it. But its also the years since retirement, to the age of death  not only the longer you play, but the longer you live after you stop playing.After retiring from football, Stabler worked as a broadcast analyst for the N.F.L. and for the University of Alabama, where he had played quarterback under Coach Bear Bryant. His damaged knees became such a problem in the past 10 years that he rarely ventured out.It was not until the final few years that his family recognized a rapid decline in his cognitive functions, too. Several symptoms  which cannot be conclusively attributed to C.T.E.  began to show themselves quickly, beginning with Stablers complaints of a high-pitched ringing in his head. In his final year, he once gritted his teeth so hard that he broke a bridge in his mouth and had to get dental implants.There were days when I walked in the door and looked at his face, and I could tell, Bush said. He was sitting in his chair, because he was always waiting for me, and the news was on and whatnot, and he had his head laid back, and his eyes just scrunched up so tight that I used to think that would give you a headache in itself, just the pure pressure of squinting like that.Noise and bright lights became enemies. A lifelong lover of music, Stabler stopped listening to the radio in the car, choosing to drive hours in silence. He increasingly complained about the clanging of kitchen dishes and the volume of the television.Family and friends found him repeating himself, sharing stories privately or during public events that he had told just minutes before. He lost his sense of direction, pointing north when he spoke about the coast just a few miles south of his home in Gulfport, Miss. Driving, he became flustered at four-way stop signs.In the fall of 2014, he moved to Arizona to be closer to his oldest daughter, Kendra Stabler Moyes, 45, and her twin sons, 17-year-old Justin and Jack, who play high school football.I remember them calling me and saying, Mom, Papa keeps stopping at green lights,  Stabler Moyes said.Stabler recognized his decline, but it was not his personality to talk about his problems. He did not tell his daughters as he battled prostate cancer for three years, harking to what John Madden, Stablers coach in Oakland, described after Stablers death  a player who would not go into the training room until he was sure everyone else was gone.His vision of what a leader is, what a strong person is, is someone who did not show signs of weakness, said Alexa Stabler, 29, the second of Stablers three grown daughters. Because it would affect the people he relied on and the people he cared about, whether that was his family or his teammates.In his later years, Stabler worried about the risk of concussions to his grandsons, a sign of his growing ambivalence toward football. The boys lived with Stabler for a time, and he drove them to school and went to all their practices and games. Both are now juniors in high school, and neither is a quarterback, but Justin wears his grandfathers No. 12 on the field.One year one of my boys wasnt sure he was going to play, and my dad was almost superexcited about it, Stabler Moyes said. He said: I think thats great. He can focus on his studies. He loved that they played, he loved watching them, but he was so worried about concussions. He was worried about their brains.Stabler wondered about his own mind years before he died. He and Bush talked about it after the 2002 death of the longtime Oakland center Dave Dalby, who mysteriously crashed his car into a tree in a parking lot. It came up again after an event where Stabler saw a struggling John Mackey, the Hall of Fame tight end. Mackey died in 2011, and C.T.E. was diagnosed.I remember Kenny looking at me and saying, You ready to deal with that?  Bush said.More and more of his peers had their brains examined and were found to have C.T.E., too. And when Seau, the former linebacker, shot himself in the chest in 2012 and was later found to have had C.T.E., Stabler vowed to give his brain for research.I asked him, point blank: Are you willing to participate in the study? Is that something you want to do?  Bush said. He said: Yeah, I want to do that. I should definitely do that. Stabler added his name to a class-action lawsuit brought by former players against the N.F.L., seeking damages from decades of concussions. The suit was settled last April and is under appeal. Under the current deal, Stablers family would not be eligible for compensation because Stablers C.T.E. was diagnosed after the April 2015 cutoff.He played 15 seasons in the N.F.L., gave up his body and, apparently, now his mind, Alexa Stabler said as she fought back tears. And to see the state that he was in physically and mentally when he died, and to learn that despite all the energy and time and resources he gave to football  and not that he played the game for free, he made money, too  without the knowledge that this is where he would end up, physically and cognitively, and for the settlement to say you get nothing? Its hard not to be angry.The day after last years Super Bowl, shortly before scheduled surgery to replace his aching knees, Stabler learned he had Stage 4 colon cancer.The cancer took him away, but his mind was definitely in a pretty quick downward spiral, Stabler Moyes said. Im grateful that he was still so present, still so there. Because I definitely dont think he would have been in even three more years.McKee found widespread damage and the buildup of abnormal tau proteins throughout Stablers brain, consistent with the symptoms that Stabler tried to disguise, mostly with his sense of humor, from all but his closest friends and family.His changes were extremely severe in parts of the brain like the hippocampus and amygdala, and those are the big learning and memory centers, McKee said. And when you see that kind of damage in those areas, usually people are demented. So if he was still functioning reasonably well, he was compensating, but I dont think that compensation would have lasted much longer.To N.F.L. fans, it can be hard to separate the swashbuckling image of the Snake from the man his family knew  a constant presence, a willing chauffeur, a not-so-great cook.Certainly my friends thought it was a cool thing to have a famous father, Marissa Stabler, 27, said. But to them he was just Mr. Kenny, our chauffeur and our chef. Hed drive us to Alabama games. He always took the time for any fan or any person. It didnt matter if we were out to dinner, he always set his fork down and took time for a conversation or an autograph. Thats just the person who he was, his Southern roots.When Stabler was 31, a 1977 Sports Illustrated feature story detailed his penchant for honky-tonks and marinas, usually with a drink in one hand and a pretty woman in the other. Already married twice, he married again before he spent 16 years in a relationship with Bush. He pondered what he might do after football. Open a honky-tonk himself, he thought.My lifestyle is too rough  too much booze and babes and cigarettes  to be a high school coach, Stabler said. Id hardly be a shining example to the young athletes of the future.His family hopes that the most powerful lesson he provides is the one delivered after he was gone."}
{"text": "CONCORD, N.H.  The lady doth protest too much, he thinks.After Hillary Clinton complained Wednesday that Bernie Sanders had committed a low blow by saying she had been a progressive only on some days, Mr. Sanders defended his remark as being entirely appropriate.To back it up, he referred to a comment Mrs. Clinton had made in September: You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty.Thats what she said, Mr. Sanders said at a news conference here Wednesday. So this is not a low blow.He went on: There is nothing wrong with people who are moderates. Some of my best friends are moderates.With that, supporters standing behind him started laughing.Mr. Sanders added for good measure, If anybody doesnt have that quote, we are happy to get it to you.Mr. Sanders had called the news conference to talk about his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and was appearing for the first time in the campaign with Secret Service protection.He was less willing to assess President Obamas progressiveness.Asked whether Mr. Obama, who has championed the trade agreement, was a progressive president, the independent democratic socialist spoke at length and admiringly about how the president has been a leader in many, many respects. Mr. Obama remains enormously popular with the base of the party the senator is trying to woo, and Mr. Sanders has repeatedly tried to embrace him politically.Asked again if he thought Mr. Obama had been a progressive president, Mr. Sanders said: Im not going to put words  yes, I think he has, in general, been very progressive. I disagree with him on a number of issues.It was Mrs. Clinton, and the Clinton campaign, that he wanted to talk about. Her campaign has accused him of hypocrisy for pledging not to make negative attacks on her while also criticizing her ties to Wall Street.Pressed again and again at the news conference as to whether his raising the Wall Street qualified as negative attacks, Mr. Sanders repeatedly accused reporters of being fed information by the Clinton campaign.I learned this about the Clinton campaign, he said. They are fantastic spinners. They can spin anything. Somebody from the Clinton campaign was going on, Bernie Sanders has run the most negative campaign in the history of the Democratic primary process. I mean, total absurdity."}
{"text": "Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky ended his presidential campaign Wednesday, after a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses this week.Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty, Mr. Paul said in a statement. Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy. Brush fires of liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I.Mr. Paul, 53, a Republican senator from Kentucky and ophthalmologist, finished the Iowa caucuses with 4.5 percent of the vote, a discouraging finish for someone who, just a year earlier, had seemed poised to make a real run at the White House.Though sometimes irascible, Mr. Paul seemed to offer an inclusive vision for the Republican Party, working across the aisle on issues like criminal justice reform and visiting places typically not trafficked by Republicans  urban centers, liberal-leaning college campuses  to make his pitch. He also inherited the libertarian streak of his father, the former congressman Ron Paul of Texas, who ran for president a number of times, including in 2008 and 2012.But some of Rand Pauls crucial issues as a senator, like using the filibuster to protest the governments use of lethal drone strikes in 2013 and again last year, in opposition to the National Security Agencys surveillance programs, failed to animate donors and voters as he had expected. Especially after the Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., terror attacks, the Republican Party seemed eager for someone with stronger national security credentials, and a less isolationist view of Americas role in the world.Mr. Paul also lacked the robust ground organization that his father had, which helped the elder Paul perform well in states with caucuses instead of primaries.While his presidential hopes are now over, he remains up for re-election in the Senate. The Republican Party in Kentucky changed the rules, creating a caucus in the state rather than a primary, which allowed Mr. Paul to run for both president and senator at the same time without violating a state law that prevents candidates from appearing on the ballot twice in the same election."}
{"text": "The experimental architect Zaha Hadids stadium design for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics has been a lightning rod nearly from the moment the city was awarded the Games more than two years ago.Citing rising costs that by some estimates had reached $2.5 billion, the Japanese government announced last July that it was scrapping Ms. Hadids plan for the 80,000-seat venue. In December, the commission was awarded to Kengo Kuma, a Japanese architect who had been a prominent critic of her design.Ms. Hadid, who has staunchly defended her design against her critics in interviews and on her website, immediately protested the decision in a statement and suggested that nationalist motives lay behind the rejection of her plan.Her studio has stepped up the attack in recent weeks, saying that Mr. Kumas design closely copied hers in significant ways, and in a Jan. 11 letter to the Japan Sport Council, which is overseeing the Games, raised the possibility of legal action against the council and Taisei Corporation, the contractor charged with building the stadium, for copyright infringement.The letter added that the council had withheld payment for her work and was demanding that she forgo copyright claims. The council acknowledged last week that it had sent a letter asking that Ms. Hadid turn over her copyright-protected designs freely without additional payment or restriction, but did not explain its reason for doing so.It's clear that the attempt to force us to hand over our copyright, something thats never happened on any of our designs, was an acknowledgement that they need to use the work of ZHA and the original design team to proceed, Ms. Hadid said last week in her first interview on the subject, referring to her studio, Zaha Hadid Architects.We wrote to the Olympics minister in August to remind him of ZHAs intellectual property rights and did not receive a response, she said, speaking by telephone from her studio in London, where on Tuesday evening she was to receive the Royal Gold Medal for lifetime achievement from the Institute of British Architects. Ms. Hadid, who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2004, is the first woman to receive the British honor.Mr. Kuma has rejected her claims, saying at a news conference on Jan. 15 that the technical requirements for stadiums by necessity resulted in some similarities. The two designs are different, he said in an email on Friday. We believe that ours does not violate any rights.The dispute over the stadium has proved an embarrassment for the Tokyo Olympic organizers, who last fall abandoned the logo design chosen for the Games after its creator faced accusations that it had been copied.From the outside, the two designs appear to be quite different. Ms. Hadids has been compared to a starship, or, less flatteringly, to a turtle. Other critics said it would be too large or displace local residents. Mr. Kumas stadium is a more-traditional oval shape with vertical wooden beams and greenery on the exterior walkways.Ms. Hadid said the similarities lay on the inside, in the engineering, the arrangement of seats and sight lines for spectators, and just as important, in her studios technological breakthroughs in modeling and construction techniques.She said that Taisei, the contractor, had access to an evolving 3D digital model of the stadium in the two years that it worked with her firm on the stadium design. She questioned how Mr. Kumas firm could come up with a complete set of blueprints in less than three months.In his recent email, Mr. Kuma said his company had worked closely with Taisei, each bringing up their own strength and experience. He added: We do not adopt anything from ZHDs design and engineering.Ms. Hadid rejected that assertion last week. To claim that the major similarities and many identical instances in the design, as well as thousands of fine details are automatic or due to chance is not credible, she said.The Japanese architect Toyo Ito, who had competed for the stadium commission after Ms. Hadids design was rejected, told Kyodo News after Mr. Kuma was chosen in December that he had noticed substantial similarities between Ms. Hadids designs and those submitted by Taisei and Mr. Kuma.I wonder if it is almost entirely based on Hadids plan, Mr. Ito said of the new design, according to The Japan Times, which published his interview with Kyodo News. Its appearance is different, but if you look under the surface, there are details that seem almost unchanged.Ms. Hadid said the rejection of her design and the decision to move ahead with blueprints that, she asserted, incorporate many of her technological breakthroughs, would come back to haunt the Japanese authorities.Leading architects all over the world will be skeptical about working in Japan, she said."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Tuesday that the United States faced a dramatically different security environment than at any point in the past 25 years, arguing for an increase in military spending to confront an array of threats like the Islamic State and Russia.Unlike in previous years when the United States could focus on one major threat at a time, like the Soviet Union or Al Qaeda, the country no longer has the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights  we have to do both, Mr. Carter said.Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of different challenges, Mr. Carter said in a speech at the Economic Club of Washington, where he provided a preview of the Pentagons 2017 budget request.The administration is expected to formally unveil the budget next week. It will call for $582.7 billion in military spending  roughly half of the governments discretionary spending.The budget will include a proposal to double the spending on the military campaign against the Islamic State, Mr. Carter said. American forces have conducted so many strikes on the group, he said, that the military is running out of smart bombs and rockets, and needs to invest $1.8 billion in 2017 to buy 45,000 more.Mr. Carter described Russia and China as the most stressing competitors as they develop military systems that threaten the United States traditional advantage.Those efforts, coupled with Russias aggression in Ukraine and Chinas in the South China Sea, have led the Defense Department to elevate their importance in our defense planning and budgeting.The budget also proposes a significant increase in spending to enhance the militarys footprint in Europe to protect NATO allies of the United States from Russia. The administration will ask for $3.4 billion  compared with $789 million in the current budget  for more training and exercises with our allies, more pre-positioned warfighting gear and infrastructure improvements to support it.And when combined with U.S. forces already in and assigned to Europe, all of this together by the end of 2017 will let us rapidly form a highly capable combined-arms ground force that can respond theaterwide if necessary, Mr. Carter said.We must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we have the capability to win, Mr. Carter said. Because a force that can deter conflict must show that it can dominate a conflict."}
{"text": "A storm packing blizzard-like conditions, as well as lightning strikes, was expected to deposit several inches of snow on the countrys midsection Tuesday.On Monday into Tuesday morning, the storm swept across Colorado, where it was billed as the first major snowstorm of 2016. By early Tuesday, it had delivered upward of 10 inches in the Denver area,  prompting officials to close schools  and promising to thwart morning commutes.To the delight of Colorados ski industry, the mountains and foothills were pounded the hardest. One resort reported Tuesday that it had received about 30 inches in the previous 48 hours.Blizzard warnings were in effect for a section of the country that includes Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the National Weather Service.The storm charged east out of Colorado and into Nebraska on Tuesday. Reports indicated that residents were waking up to a nasty brew of heavy snow, fierce winds and lightning.The Weather Service reported winds of up to nearly 60 miles an hour, and an AccuWeather meteorologist, Jesse Ferrell, said on Twitter that Nebraska and neighboring Iowa had been hit by more than 100 lightning strikes in the span of hours.The Nebraska State Patrol was warning residents to avoid driving, posting images on social media showing roads made impassable by a heavy blanket of snow.The Omaha Public Power District reported that more than 20,000 customers were without power early Tuesday. Omahas main airport, Eppley Airfield, remained open, but passengers were warned to check the status of their flights. Forty-four flights had been canceled by early Tuesday.Before advancing east on the Plains, the storm had delivered whipping winds, heavy rain and snow to California and parts of the southwest.The storm was expected to deliver heavy snow to Iowa later Tuesday, a day after voters there gathered for the presidential caucuses. The campaigns had scrambled to arrange hasty exits to New Hampshire, which will hold its primary Feb. 9."}
{"text": "Ted Cruzs success in the Iowa caucuses on Monday was a victory for the Republican base, if not for the party establishment. Looking ahead to New Hampshire, the terrain will be quite different.Mr. Cruz drew his strongest support from very conservative voters, 43 percent of whom backed him, and from those primarily seeking a candidate who shared their values, according to Edison Research, which conducted entrance polls at precincts across the state.He also won a plurality of the white evangelical vote, with 33 percent to Donald J. Trumps 21 percent, after receiving crucial endorsements in the state from the religious leader Bob Vander Plaats and from Representative Steve King.Mr. Cruz even eked out a slight advantage over Mr. Trump among voters without college degrees. Less-educated voters have been a major source of Mr. Trumps support.But if the Iowa caucuses cater to the Republican Partys conservative base, New Hampshire is typically a state where broadly palatable, general-election-friendly candidates can stake their hopes. (Govs. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Chris Christie of New Jersey, relative moderates who each won less than 2 percent of the vote at Mondays caucuses, have invested heavily in New Hampshire while virtually ignoring Iowa.)The strong third-place finish on Monday of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida could position him as the candidate who threads the needle between the Republican base and the partys business elite.Mr. Rubio earned 23 percent of the vote at last nights caucuses, more than any major pre-election poll had indicated. And the demographic groups that supported him most strongly tend to be of core importance to the Republican electorate in New Hampshire.He was the favorite among college graduates, 27 percent of whom backed him, and among those who rated the economy and jobs as their highest priority, according to the Edison entrance polling. In 2012, college graduates made up 55 percent of the voters in the Republican primary in New Hampshire, according to exit polls by Edison.Mr. Rubio also beat Mr. Cruz by nearly three to one among self-described moderates and liberals in Iowa  though Mr. Trump carried this group, with 34 percent. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump each earned 22 percent among those who described themselves as independents, more than any other candidates. The Republican primary in New Hampshire is open to undeclared voters; in 2012, moderates and liberals cast three of every 10 ballots. (By contrast, 85 percent of the Iowa caucusgoers this year were conservatives.)Those with family incomes of more than $100,000 a year accounted for roughly four in 10 voters at the 2012 New Hampshire primary, suggesting an opportunity for Mr. Rubio. He is increasingly positioning himself as the candidate to unite the partys wealthier, executive sector with its populist, conservative base.What is perhaps most notable, Mr. Rubio won a whopping 43 percent support among Iowa caucusgoers most interested in finding a candidate who can win the general election. In 2012, those voters made up 45 percent of New Hampshires primary voters, compared with less than one in three Iowa caucusgoers that year. (This time round, they accounted for just 21 percent of Republican caucus attendees.)The caucuses on Monday were marked by overwhelming turnout on both the Republican and the Democratic sides. More than 186,000 Iowans attended the Republican caucuses, the highest on record. Over 170,000 Democrats caucused, too, exceeding most projections.For Mr. Trump, the high participation did not translate into victory, as many pundits had predicted it might. Forty-six percent of caucusgoers had never attended one before, and Mr. Trump won 31 percent of those voters. But Mr. Cruz earned an equal share of support from Iowans who had caucused in the past, a larger slice of the electorate.On the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton escaped with a narrow victory, Senator Bernie Sanders earned almost six in 10 votes from first-time caucusgoers. Mrs. Clinton won caucus veterans by virtually the same margin.\nMr. Sanders proved most popular among those under 30  with 84 percent support  and among those who described themselves as independents, about seven in 10 of whom caucused for him.With less than a week to go until the New Hampshire primary, polls show Mr. Sanders with a commanding, sometimes two-to-one lead there over Mrs. Clinton. The depth of his support may have to do with the Granite States reputation for hostility to establishment politics: Fully 44 percent of voters in the 2008 Democratic primary  which Mrs. Clinton narrowly won  identified themselves as independents.Giovanni Russonello is a member of The Timess news surveys department.\nThis is one of an occasional series of posts taking a deeper look at polling during this campaign cycle."}
{"text": "The Pentagon has put Russia at the top of its list of national security threats with its plan to increase the deployment of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and troops on rotating assignment to NATO countries in Central and Eastern Europe.In a speech on Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter listed a hierarchy of threats to the United States, which included China, North Korea, Iran and finally, the fight against terrorism. But his primary focus was Russia.While he makes a good case for deterring Russian aggression, his proposal to quadruple military spending in Europe in 2017 to $3.4 billion from $789 million seems excessive and raises questions about whether other immediate threats, like the Islamic State, are getting short shrift.It is undeniable that Russia has become openly aggressive under President Vladimir Putin, who has violated sovereign borders by annexing Crimea and stoking civil war in Ukraine. A cease-fire in Ukraine was declared last year, but Russian forces still maintain a presence in eastern Ukraine, raising questions about whether Russia might try to extend its reach to the Baltic States.There are other concerns as well. Russia has built a web of complex missile defenses that increasingly threaten NATOs military access to airspace in parts of Europe, including one-third of the skies of Poland. Similar Russian missile buildups are underway in Crimea and in Syria, where the Russians have beefed up their air campaign on behalf of the Assad government.Given the Russian moves, its important that the United States and NATO allies reinforce their commitment to the common defense, especially at a time when Europe is under great stress from the flow of Syrians and other refugees and the rise of anti-immigrant right-wing political parties.Over the past two years, the United States has already increased its military exercises and rotation of forces in Europe. Mr. Carters new plan would ensure that the alliance can maintain a full armored combat brigade, roughly 5,000 troops, in the region at all times, including in Hungary, Romania and the Baltic countries. Under a 1997 agreement, NATO and Russia agreed not to permanently station troops or nuclear weapons on each others borders. The Americans say the plan would not violate this pledge because the troops will rotate, even though the effect will be a constant presence.The increased American investment sends a message to Mr. Putin and provides leverage to demand that other NATO countries do more to increase their own defense budgets. But the sheer size of the spending increase seems like a return to the Pentagons blank-check ways during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Even though the United States spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined, the Pentagon has been chafing under budget cuts. In fact, the increased money for European defense is supposed to come from a war account that pays for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which allows the administration to get around budget caps.Deterring Russia is essential. But this initiative seems like a reversion back to what the Pentagon has traditionally done  prepare to fight big wars with ever more costly weapons against adversaries like Russia. Threats from the Islamic State and other terrorist groups are messier and harder to predict. America must be able to confront both, but it is unclear that Mr. Carters plan gets the balance right."}
{"text": "Lela Moore is a news assistant on The Timess Community Desk.Two political parties and their presidential candidates went into the Iowa caucuses on Monday. Only one clear winner, Senator Ted Cruz for the Republicans, emerged. The Democrats were faced with a near-deadlock between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, throwing more uncertainty into a race in which the result once seemed almost predestined.Mr. Cruzs victory over Donald J. Trump was a narrow one, and readers split on whether it would be enough to eventually propel Mr. Cruz to the Republican nomination.The fact is that this is a big loss for Cruz. The large majority of the Iowa G.O.P. are fundamentalist Christians and they dont think Trump is a Christian. Cruz should have won by 15%, said Neil Wilson of New Zealand.And Ken Russell of New York said, That the three candidates are separated by less than 5 percent clearly indicates huge rifts in the party and among voters. This is a hollow victory for Cruz and an affirmation for Trump and [Senator Marco] Rubio. Only time will tell which of the 3 can manage a clear lead among voters.But Tom Paine of Charleston, S.C., pointed to a risky stance taken by Mr. Cruz that paid off. Cruz was the only candidate to offer a plan to wean the country from ethanol, while Trump boasted that he loved it. That stance had to cost Cruz votes  yet he still won. Impressive victory for the smartest guy in the field.As for that notorious runner-up, Mr. Trump, Liz of New York said, Im actually amazed that Trump did as well as he did, without accumulated political experience/first hand knowledge of how you run a great ground game in an election. If he manages to master that hell be a significant contender. It aint over among the Rs, not by a long shot.Trump blew it, said ABMIII of Washington Crossing, Pa. Republicans are paying attention now, and the Iowa results could very well mark the end of Trumps lead and will likely find Cruz and Rubio pulling ahead of the field with perhaps another more pragmatic candidate surging in New Hampshire.Some readers saw Mrs. Clintons narrow victory as a boon to her, others interpreted it as a hopeful sign for Mr. Sanders.Hillary Clinton WON, and by what margin, who cares! If this were a football game, with Peyton having won on a mere extra point, surely we wouldnt call it a tie, said Keysgirlatheart1991 of New York.A loss by virtually a hair in Iowa yet should spread some very uplifting news among all Sanders disappointed supporters out there, said jeanfrancois of Paris.But many Times readers differed on whether the Democratic results represented good news for either major candidate.And most readers overlooked Martin OMalley altogether, though Lee Harrison of Albany said bluntly of the former Maryland governors poor showing: OMalley is out. Come November...Hillary or Bernie will be the Democratic nominee. That nominee will need the Democrats to come together.This is a huge fail for the Clinton campaign, said MSPWEHO of West Hollywood, Calif. She had deep prior experience, she had deep pockets, she had high profile endorsements, she had the celebrity magnetism of her husband, daughter and self, and yet here we all are  at a dead heat standstill well after 1 a.m. Tuesday morning in Iowa.But kicksotic of New York argued that, Despite the excitement and large crowds, Sanders was unable to move far enough beyond his core demographic  young, white and liberal  to make a difference. At the end of the day, as weve just seen in Iowa, no matter how hard he tries, Bernie aint Obama.Others were more hopeful on Sanders.Sanders, as late as December, didnt even have campaign material for volunteers to hand-out when hitting prospective caucus-goers front doors in Burlington, Iowa. Key cities didnt have Sanders campaign offices, said Bill Edley of Springfield, Ill., who said he had spent 28 years campaigning for Democrats before the Iowa caucuses. What Sanders turned out, he turned out by the strength of his message and the passion of his volunteers. That alone should scare the bejesus out of the Clintons.Meanwhile, JamesDJ believes the near-deadlock gave both Democratic candidates a springboard going forward. A Sanders-Clinton tie is the best possible outcome for America. These two candidates are now in the position to have the serious discussions about our countrys future that need to take place right now.Many Iowans offered their own perspectives on the circus that comes to their town every four years.From an Iowa perspective, the success of the three top evangelical candidates  Cruz, Rubio, and Carson  are consistent with the percentage of G.O.P. caucusers who self-reported as evangelicals, said All Harbe of Iowa.Hillary & Bernie  I wish you both well. You are stand-up people trying to do the right things. The Republican field? Wow! The intersection of the Twilight Zone meeting the 21st Century. More humor than angst in viewing them, said Ron Blair of Fairfield, Iowa.Anyway, we can all settle down now, Iowa has calmed the waters, said Real Iowan of Clear Lake, Iowa."}
{"text": "Eduardo Cornejo had been an officer in the New York Police Department for more than a decade. But in a phone call one night last month, the authorities said, he hinted at his other, more nefarious work.That might make it hot, though, standing outside with a bunch of girls, Mr. Cornejo said, a reference, according to the authorities, to dividing money among the prostitutes he is accused of employing outside a Long Island motel. Theyre going to know whats up real quick.But investigators were already aware of the operation, the authorities said on Tuesday. They were listening to the phone call  his line had been wiretapped  and had been tracking his movements for months after an anonymous tipster said Mr. Cornejo was a pimp for at least one woman.In all, the authorities said, he had employed at least 10 prostitutes. Investigators followed him to motels across the region, and the authorities described his efforts as something of a second job, starting many evenings as soon as his shift ended with the Police Department.Mr. Cornejo, 33, was charged on Tuesday with transporting women in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution, a federal offense, for ferrying women to motels in New Jersey and on Staten Island and Long Island, according to the United States attorneys office for the Eastern District.He was arrested after a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Police Departments Internal Affairs Bureau, which reviews police conduct.Cornejo not only abused the public trust given to him as an N.Y.P.D. officer, but he showed no human decency when he facilitated the exploitation of women for profit, Diego Rodriguez, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.s field office in New York, said in a statement. Police officers, like all public servants, are held to a higher standard, and should not violate the very same laws they are supposed to enforce.Mr. Cornejo was fired by the Police Department on Jan. 16 because he failed a random drug test, Stephen P. Davis, the departments chief spokesman, said.Separate from the drug test, he said, Mr. Cornejo was the subject of an internal investigation initiated by the Internal Affairs Bureau after receiving the anonymous tip.The investigation was initiated in May, Mr. Davis said, when the person first contacted the police. The police brought the case to federal prosecutors in November.When they determined the nature and scope of the case, and that it involved interstate transport, they contacted the federal authorities, he added. That led to the wiretapping of Mr. Cornejos phone and the taping of conversations  like the one on Jan. 21 about the bunch of girls, which were documented in a criminal complaint unsealed on Tuesday.At his arraignment on Tuesday, a judge ordered Mr. Cornejo to be held without bail until a hearing on Wednesday. His lawyer, Michael P. Padden, declined to comment.An official with the independent city agency that investigates police wrongdoing declined to comment about whether Mr. Cornejo had been the subject of complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.We would not be able to say either way whether the officer has been the subject of any complaints, and if so, their type or disposition, said Brian Krist, the assistant deputy executive of investigations for the agency, citing the states civil rights law that prohibits the release of a wide range of official information.Mr. Cornejo was named in four civil lawsuits in recent years; the cases centered on alleged administrative and on-duty misconduct, but not criminal activity.In one lawsuit, which is still open, Mr. Cornejo is accused with other officers of encircling Richard Underwood, 21, who tried to record officers as they were arresting his brother on Lafayette Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Mr. Underwoods lawyer, Robert Marinelli, said.Mr. Underwood was arrested at the time on suspicion of disorderly conduct, but he was never prosecuted.And in a separate case in 2014, Jonathan Anthony Fink, a lawyer, said that his client, Jason Crushon, had been beaten by the police in Brooklyn. Mr. Cornejo was one of several officers named in a federal lawsuit he filed in April alleging excessive force against Mr. Crushon during a narcotics arrest, Mr. Fink said.Im not aware that Cornejo was involved in any other acts of wrongdoing, he said. Id like to know more."}
{"text": "KABUL, Afghanistan  Airstrikes against the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan have killed dozens of militants and knocked out their clandestine radio station, an official said Tuesday.The official, Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar Province, said four airstrikes on Monday evening in the Achin district killed 29 militants affiliated with the Islamic State in the eastern province, which borders Pakistan. The strikes also demolished a radio station known as the Voice of the Caliphate that had been broadcasting propaganda on behalf of the group, he said.In Kabul, Dawlat Waziri, a Defense Ministry spokesman, told Tolo News that the Afghan Air Force had carried out the airstrikes. Col. Michael T. Lawhorn, a spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, said that the United States military had also carried out a counterterrorism strike in that district, but could not confirm that it was in any way related to the radio station.The local affiliate is composed mainly of disgruntled former Afghan and Pakistani Taliban members and is only loosely related to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While Afghan and American intelligence officials are watching it closely, it remains a fringe threat for now, and is fighting the Taliban for its survival.President Obama in December signed an order broadening the rules of engagement of American forces in Afghanistan, allowing them to attack Islamic State targets."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Welcome to New Hampshire, a state with a history of rebutting Iowas best-laid plans. Here, the Republicans four so-called establishment candidates  former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida  hope to emerge as a clear alternative to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Donald J. Trump, who finished in the top two slots on Monday evening in Iowa. Mr. Rubio enters New Hampshire with the clear momentum, having finished third in Iowa and well ahead of his rivals. But the three governors still believe New Hampshire is their best shot to reinvigorate their campaigns.Here is a look at how the four men hope to turn the state to their advantage.Mr. Bushs team has long staked its campaign turnaround on New Hampshire  a state where several aides and supporters describe the strategy as a game of Whac-a-Mole. Mr. Bushs main rival here is Mr. Rubio, whom he hopes to finish above  or virtually tied with  in order to harness the momentum and enthusiasm he needs to keep his campaign afloat. But other candidates competing for more moderate voters, like Mr. Kasich, pose more of an immediate threat by poaching potential Bush supporters.Mr. Bush hopes to emerge as the serious alternative to Mr. Trump, and has long trained his attacks on the businessman-turned-reality-TV-star. (That pitch, however, just became much tougher after Mr. Rubios strong finish in Iowa, nipping at Mr. Trumps heels.) Mr. Bush has also increasingly started to contrast his record with those of his more moderate rivals. And expect Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Mr. Bush, to intensify its already robust assaults on Mr. Christie, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio. The Bush campaign has five offices and more than 40 paid staff members in the state._____Mr. Christie said he hoped to be the top vote-getter in Iowa among the governors. That did not happen, with Mr. Christie finishing just behind Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich  all three men earned minimal, low-single-digit support in Iowa. Heading into New Hampshire, Mr. Christie plans to make an argument based on his experience, highlighting his time leading New Jersey, in contrast to his first-term senator rivals. A skilled retail politician, Mr. Christie rose in the polls here by holding long town hall-style events where he bantered with voters. Now, expect him to hold more frequent  and smaller  question-and-answer sessions, equally rich with voter interaction.His campaign believes he can win over independent-minded voters in New Hampshire who might otherwise vote Democratic by using a narrative that he fought for conservative principles in New Jerseys Democratic Legislature, but recent polls here have shown him slipping. The Christie team has two offices and six full-time employees here._____Mr. Kasich has run a New Hampshire-or-bust campaign, racking up an impressive number of endorsements from local newspapers and recently rising in polls. Mr. Kasich also spent the days before the Iowa caucuses here in New Hampshire  a fact his team hopes will not go unnoticed by the states voters.The Ohio governor is casting himself as a fiscally conservative happy warrior who brought prosperity to his state while expressing compassion for the poor. The goal: to create a broad coalition that includes not just the states conservative voters, but also independents and possible Democrats. Mr. Kasichs team has five offices and more than 20 paid staff members in the state. He is also making a show of holding town hall-style event after town hall-style event  he is on track to hit 100 before Primary Day, and his team is working on securing permits for fireworks._____Mr. Rubio finished third in Iowa  close behind Mr. Trump and well ahead of his establishment rivals. His campaign plans to harness that momentum to cast him as the most conservative Republican who can beat Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, unite the Republican Party and win the general election in November. Pragmatic electability, coupled with a hopeful and optimistic message, is Mr. Rubios core pitch, aimed at voters and donors eager to get a Republican back in the White House. Mr. Rubio will also stress his national security credentials, a crucial issue with voters here.Mr. Rubios strong showing in Iowa is certain to make him a target in New Hampshire. The Florida senator is likely to try to cast himself as more electable than both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich. And his campaign plans to question Mr. Christies conservative credentials on issues like abortion and guns. Mr. Rubio has two offices and more than a dozen full-time staff members in the state."}

{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.   Senator Marco Rubio of Florida landed here at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, bleary but beaming from a surprisingly strong showing in Iowa, and confronted growing expectations from his partys establishment that he may be the best equipped to unite Republicans.Mr. Rubios tally in Iowa  where he received 23 percent of the vote and came within one point of Donald J. Trump  gave his campaign another jolt of energy at a time when good fortune seems to be breaking his way. Wall Street financiers are increasingly moving to support him, as disclosures this week by a super PAC backing him made clear. He picked up a coveted endorsement in South Carolina from Senator Tim Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate.His campaign appears to be leaving little to chance, aware that a lackluster result here would greatly diminish him. He began a week of morning-to-night campaigning early on Tuesday, stopping at a diner before dawn to work the room, field congratulations and issue a plea for support.We need your help, he said. Weve got a lot of work to do here in New Hampshire. As he walked from table to table, one well-wisher passed him a clear plastic bag with several cigars in it. Mr. Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, accepted them and smiled. Maybe well save them for Tuesday night, he said.Many leaders of the Republican establishment, as they praised Mr. Rubio over the past six months, predicted that the Florida senator would become a major force in the primary and shift the race away from the more conservative candidates. New Hampshire may be that moment. Mr. Rubio will be in the state every day until the primary on Tuesday. Scores of volunteers will hit the streets with the goal of reaching thousands of homes. Last weekend they hit 10,000.On the fund-raising front, his team has begun a concerted and continuous push to persuade donors who are either undecided or backing candidates like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida that it is time to climb aboard the Rubio train. The pitch, which supporters began making in phone calls and text messages on Monday night just minutes after the networks called the race, is blunt and self-assured: The Republican race has narrowed to a three-man contest.The Rubio campaign is also eyeing new lines of attack against rivals who have spent considerable time in New Hampshire, like Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, trying to prevent them from rising in the days ahead, and diverting attention away from his sudden climb.He lobbed one of those attacks at Mr. Christie on Tuesday, sounding almost Trump-like when he said the governor had been embarrassed by receiving less than 2 percent of the vote in Iowa. I think Chris has had a tough couple of days, he said. He did very poorly yesterday.Inside the Rubio headquarters here, there are ample signs of a campaign that is sprinting to the finish.The detailed demographic breakdown of likely New Hampshire voters tacked to the wall, the tallies of thousands of phone calls made and doors knocked on, and the rankings of volunteers who have exceeded targets all point to a largely unnoticed effort to build a network of support.Ryan Fattman, 31, a state senator from central Massachusetts, said that since July he had recruited about 350 volunteers from across his state to help campaign for Mr. Rubio in New Hampshire, part of a broader effort to mobilize state and local politicians from across New England.The result, he said, has been a volunteer-based network that has been working quietly for months. I think their ground game has been kind of a hidden secret, he said. Part of the campaigns brilliance is not advertising everything its doing.Still, allies say Mr. Rubio is struggling to peel away Republican donors who have warmed to Mr. Cruzs pitch that he is the only candidate capable of sewing up the nomination neatly  a message that has gained strength since Mr. Cruzs win in Iowa.In addition, Mr. Rubio is bracing for aggressive attacks from his Republican rivals; Right to Rise, the pro-Bush super PAC, has $1 million in advertising time reserved in New Hampshire through the primary.Its like an army in retreat thats been instructed to burn the bridges, blow up the air fields, destroy everything, said J. Warren Tompkins, who runs the super PAC backing Mr. Rubio, Conservative Solutions. It slows things down a little. But it only leaves a bigger mess for everyone to clean up.The Rubio operation in New Hampshire is similar to what the campaign has constructed in South Carolina and Nevada, which vote later this month, and in Florida, which has a critical primary on March 15.In Nevada, for instance, the campaign is already making upward of 20,000 phone calls each week ahead of the Feb. 23 caucuses. It has two field offices, one in Las Vegas and the other in Reno, and a half-dozen paid staff members there.In Florida, the campaign has launched its program for volunteers to make calls from home, intending to get ahead of the states absentee voting deadlines.Mr. Rubio has maintained the same optimistic outlook through the highs and lows of his campaign. In an interview in Iowa last week, he predicted that his competition was about to shrink among candidates who went all-in in certain states.If they dont do well enough to continue, theyre going to have trouble, he said.He did not name names, but could easily have been referring to any of the men he is now fighting with in New Hampshire: Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie or Mr. Kasich.That will sort itself out, he added."}

{"text": "SYDNEY, Australia  Health officials in Australia on Tuesday confirmed two cases of the Zika virus in residents who most likely were infected on a visit to Haiti, and the officials also warned pregnant women not to travel to areas where transmission rates are high, like the Caribbean.The two residents, from New South Wales, had mild cases of the virus when they returned from Haiti and have since recovered. The virus does not pose a serious threat to Australia, the Health Department said.It is very unlikely that Zika virus established local transmission in New South Wales as the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, that spread the infection are not established here  although they are found in some parts of North Queensland, Dr. Vicky Sheppeard, the states communicable diseases director, said in a statement after confirming Australias first cases of the virus this year. Since 2014, occasional cases of Zika have been identified in New South Wales among people who had traveled to areas where the virus has been most commonly transmitted, the statement said.The World Health Organization said on Monday that the virus was an international public health emergency. The main concern is the viruss possible link to microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads and, in the majority of cases, damaged brains.Australian health officials issued a comprehensive warning to health professionals and travelers on Tuesday, saying that at least 21 countries and territories of Latin America and the Caribbean had reported outbreaks of Zika and that the virus had been spread in Samoa and Tonga, in the South Pacific.Due to the possibility of severe outcomes for unborn babies, women who are pregnant, or who are planning to become pregnant, should consider delaying their travel to areas with active outbreaks of Zika, New South Wales health officials said on Tuesday.In a statement, the Health Department also warned that the virus-carrying mosquitoes tend to live and bite people indoors and that they often hide under furniture. Peak biting periods tend to be during the day, and people may not notice they have been bitten.The Health Department also said Tuesday that pesticides would be used in the cabins of some flights arriving in Sydney. These measures are undertaken to prevent the exotic mosquitoes establishing breeding populations in Australia, officials said in a statement.The process involves crew spraying airborne insecticides through the cabin, a common practice in Australia and New Zealand to kill soft-bodied insects.Dr. Cameron Webb, a medical entomologist at the University of Sydney, said Australia had had a trickle of cases of Zika virus coming back into the country over the last decade.The virus has been picked up by travelers who have come back into Australia after being in Asia or the Pacific, he said. The risks are minimal in Australia because the mosquitoes are only found in far North Queensland, not in the heavily populated cities, and that provides a buffer.Health officials in far North Queensland increased monitoring programs on Monday."}
{"text": "If Mayor Bill de Blasio thought he had a difficult time in Iowa, knocking on doors for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, he returned home to a grimmer challenge: marshaling votes for his plan to shrink the horse-carriage trade and restrict it to Central Park.In his absence, opposition has built  prompting the mayor and his surrogates to do some last-minute vote wrangling to counter the growing number of antagonists.An influential labor group, the Central Labor Council, made calls to elected leaders urging them to oppose the legislation, which heads for a vote on Friday. Pedicab drivers, who would be banished from the lucrative lower section of the park as part of the deal, began organizing under the banner of another labor organization.Horse-carriage drivers  ostensibly represented by the Teamsters, who signed on to Mr. de Blasios deal  voted late last week to oppose the deal. The Central Park Conservancy has raised significant concerns about the impact of the proposal, including the increased traffic from horses on park drives, the bridle path and transverse roads.And some members of the City Council have even spoken of a sort of local analog of the congressional nuclear option, a little-known provision in the Council rules that would allow for changes to the otherwise final carriage bill on the day of the vote  raising the prospect of a contentious floor debate rarely seen in the usually soporific confines of the Councils chambers.Its never been done before, but its possible, said Councilman Carlos Menchaca, a Brooklyn Democrat who is pushing to remove the pedicab driver ban from the bill. A real option is that we postpone the bill, have a second hearing.The bill before the Council on Friday would allow for only 95 horses, down from the current 220, with 75 animals allowed to work in the park at a time. It would restrict pedicabs from operating in Central Park below 85th Street; authorize construction of a new stable by fall 2018, along the 85th Street transverse in Central Park, built inside an existing park building; and authorize the construction of an adjacent structure for the carriages.Administration officials said privately that the storm and stress ahead of the vote on Friday was not unusual for the days before, as did Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, a Democrat from Manhattan, a sponsor of the bill, who called it a good compromise.Others were less certain.I wasnt satisfied with my conversations with the administration on this, said Councilman David Greenfield, a Brooklyn Democrat who has called for delaying the vote. Right now it seems like lose-lose.But despite wavering support, the bill appeared as of Tuesday evening to have enough votes to pass narrowly. (Because two council members are absent for medical reasons, one will be on vacation and one seat is vacant, there are fewer votes up for grabs on Friday.)Weve worked in good faith with the Teamsters and Council speaker to find the right approach, and were confident well get it done, said Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for the mayors office.That has led those in opposition to ramp up their efforts in the last few days.Were talking to everybody, said John Samuelsen, the president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, which is seeking to organize the pedicab drivers. And were targeting the ones that we think are going to vote with de Blasio on this terrifically concocted scheme.For Mr. de Blasio, the issue of horse carriages has been a yoke that he cannot seem to shed. Backed by money from wealthy advocates against New York Citys horse carriages during his 2013 mayoral campaign, he promised a total ban on his first day in office.The mayor did not immediately deliver on his vow; polls and newspaper headlines indicated that his stance was unpopular. But he arrived at a compromise that preserved the industry and moved horses out of street traffic.The bill came before a Council hearing last month, but the de Blasio administration struggled to answer basic questions, surprising some members who began to question their support for it. Last week, the administration moved to fill in the gaps with a fact sheet on the proposal sent to all members, including the price: about $25 million. Roughly 40 to 50 carriage driver jobs would be lost, the administration said.Since the hearing last month, the city made several commitments to carriage drivers outside of the content of the bill, according to a union official with direct knowledge of the conversations and who was not authorized to discuss them publicly, including hack stands visible from park entrances and assistance from NYC & Company to promote the carriage industry.Some council members said they had received calls from Mr. de Blasio, or his top surrogates, during the mayors four-day trip in Iowa on Mrs. Clintons behalf. Mr. de Blasio did not appear at any event with her during his trip.One of those calls, according to a person briefed on their conversation who was not authorized to speak about the matter, was to Vincent Alvarez, the president of the Central Labor Council, the umbrella organization for the citys union members. Mr. Alvarez had reached out to several council members to caution against the bill, as written, over the weekend. The person said Mr. de Blasio argued forcefully for the bill during the phone call. (The union leader declined a request for comment.)Ian McKeever, a carriage driver and owner, said the timeline presented by the city would severely threaten the carriage industry over the next two years. Were all against this bill, he said of the drivers. This is a ban bill wrapped up in clothing because we will not be able to survive until the stables are opened."}
{"text": "More than a dozen elephants from southern Africa are being moved to American zoos, a plan that critics say will imperil the animals.The United States Fish and Wildlife Service last month approved the transfer of the 18 African elephants from Swaziland to three destinations: the Dallas Zoo; the Sedgwick County Zoo in Kansas; and the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha. A statement from the wildlife service said the animals were threatened by habitat destruction and drought in Swaziland  and were scheduled to be culled.The three zoos have formed a partnership to import the animals, saying that dozens of elephants are confined to fenced enclosures in two privately managed parks in Swaziland, a small, landlocked country bordering South Africa and Mozambique. The zoos said they had not bought the animals but instead would donate money to the countrys rhino-conservation efforts.The wildlife service approved the permit, saying in a statement on Jan. 21 that several conditions had been met to import of the elephants, including: the move would not be detrimental to them; they would be suitably cared for; and they would not be used for primarily commercial purposes.Conservationists and rights groups, however, have criticized the pending move, saying that wild elephants often suffer health problems in zoos and that the relocation had no conservation value, according to The Associated Press.Its condemning these wild animals  sentient wild animals  to life imprisonment, said Francis Garrard, the director of the Conservation Action Trust in South Africa, according to the A.P.Last year, animal rights groups, including PETA, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and the Performing Animal Welfare Society, wrote to the wildlife service objecting to the zoos application to import the elephants. The groups cited the stress from captivity, transport and splitting up elephant families and said that the zoos were not suitably equipped to house them.The wildlife services associate director, Robert Dreher, told the A.P. during a trip to South Africa on Saturday that he recognized the humanitarian concerns of opponents of the elephants trip. But he said that it did not threaten conservation of the species, which is being heavily poached, and that zoos educated the public about wildlife.It is not the first time that animal and elephant welfare groups tried to block the importation of elephants from Swaziland. In 2003, officials at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Fla., wanted to import 11 orphaned elephants, saying that it would prevent them from being killed, but the plan drew opposition.Swazilands elephants were wiped out decades ago, but they were reintroduced into the country between 1987 and 1994, and kept in fenced areas in the country, which is about the size of Connecticut. There, protected from poachers, their numbers continued to grow, but the elephants had a destructive impact on their enclosed habitats, and that has been made worse by drought, the wildlife service said.In 2014, 39 elephants lived in 23 square miles of habitat, the wildlife service said.A report from the Dallas Zoo said the Swaziland park managers supplied the elephants with water and hay. It said the elephants were being imported into the United States to prevent further degradation of the landscape and in order to make room for critically endangered rhinos. If the elephants are not relocated, they will be culled.Gregg Hudson, the president of the Dallas Zoo, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the zoo partnership had not paid for the animals but that it was contributing $450,000 over five years to a wildlife conservation trust in Swaziland for rhinos.He said the 18 elephants were still in Swaziland as logistics and medical assessments were being completed. It was not immediately clear when they would start their trip to the United States, which they will make in a 747 airplane, he said.Once in the United States, the group would likely be split up and distributed to the three zoos. Mr. Hudson said they were attempting to preserve existing social and family links among the animals, which include 15 female elephants and three male elephants ranging in age from about six years to the early 20s.The elephants that end up in Dallas will be housed in the zoos Giants of the Savannah enclosure, which is six acres. There are already four elephants there, he said.In Omaha, a $73 million, 28-acre African Grasslands project is under construction, which will include elephants, a statement on the zoos website said. The zoo was closed on Tuesday, and there was no immediate comment on the elephants prospective housing.At the zoo in Kansas, the elephants will live on five acres outdoors and in an 18,000-square-foot indoor space, built to accommodate a herd of up to nine elephants. They will join one female elephant at the zoo, a spokeswoman, Melissa Graham, said in an email.The plan to move them to the United States is a pragmatic and humane solution to help balance this environment and provide a home to elephants that need one, while at the same time expands a critically needed rhino conservation program, Ms. Graham said."}
{"text": "Observing two cultural celebrations at the same time can lead to controversy, the Sacramento Kings learned this week.On Monday night, the team hastily removed free Year of the Monkey T-shirts for fans from arena seats after complaints that the giveaway was racially insensitive on the first night of Black History Month.The Lunar New Year, an Asian festival that will start on Monday in the United States, is the highlight of the Chinese calendar. Each year is based on a symbol of the Chinese horoscope, and this is the Year of the Monkey, the ninth of 12 animals in the cycle. But the teams effort to celebrate seemed misplaced to some at the start of the annual celebration of African-American heritage.Images of workers removing the shirts from seats at the Sleep Train arena, where the Kings were playing the Milwaukee Bucks, were published on social media.On Facebook, the former N.B.A. All-Star Marques Johnson, a television analyst for the Bucks, described an encounter he had on Monday night with DeMarcus Cousins, the Kings All-Star center, who objected to the shirts: I walk into the building, and DeMarcus Cousins calls me over to an animated discussion hes having with Kings operations people. He ask me, Olskool, what you think about this T-shirt? Told him a little insensitive on 1st day of Black History Month. They pulled the shirts. ...On Monday night, players and coaches were wearing Black History Month shirts during warm-up. Cousins did not play on Monday night because of a sprained ankle.The Kings went on to defeat the Bucks, 111-104.The N.B.A. has celebrated the Lunar New Year before as part of its community engagement programs. In 2015, it ushered in the Year of the Goat with activities including prizes, performances and special foods to celebrate the diversity of the leagues fan base.This year, other teams in the league have participated in New Year events. The Charlotte Hornets guard Jeremy Lin and players from other teams were featured in a television Dining Table spot as part of celebrations from Feb. 3 to 21.The Sacramento Bee reported that the Year of the Monkey shirts were removed from the seats about 90 minutes before the game started. Other celebrations of the Lunar Year went ahead as planned, including a ribbon dance by the Kings dancers.We all need a lesson in sensitivity, the Kings president, Chris Granger, told The Sacramento Bee. In an effort to celebrate Chinese New Year, we had some concerns about the T-shirt giveaway, so we pulled them all before the doors opened. Certainly we dont want to offend anybody, and we acted as soon as we heard the concern."}
{"text": "CONCORD, N.H.  Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey kept up his scalding criticism of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday, declaring, despite polls to the contrary, that they were the two main options for New Hampshire voters.Really, this New Hampshire primary is now down to a choice between me and Marco Rubio, and everybody knows it, Mr. Christie declared at a news conference here, where he was endorsed by Shawn Jasper, the speaker of the New Hampshire House.Mr. Christie said the race amounted to a choice between a tested, experienced leader and someone who is new at this business. Describing himself as Mr. Rubios impediment to the next round, he added, I think people in New Jersey learned a long time ago: Its tough to come through me.New Hampshire is a make-or-break state for Mr. Christie, who finished in 10th place in Iowa but is hoping to emerge from New Hampshire as the leading Republican among the so-called establishment candidates.That quest was complicated by Mr. Rubios strong third-place finish in Iowa, and on Tuesday, Mr. Christie derided the senator as the boy in the bubble, citing what he said was the senators scripted nature and aversion to answering questions.On Wednesday, Mr. Christie used the same insult against Mr. Rubio, and ticked off a long list of what he viewed as the senators shortcomings, including the length of his town hall meetings (too short), his stump speech (unchanged in years) and his Senate achievements (nonexistent).Mr. Christie said he would challenge anyone to show me the significant accomplishment that Senator Rubio has done while hes in the United States Senate.I cant find one, he said.In an interview on Fox News on Wednesday, Mr. Christie said Mr. Rubio acts like the king of England in avoiding unwanted questions from the news media. It sounds like hes in the witness protection program, Mr. Christie said of Mr. Rubios strategy.Polls in New Hampshire do not support Mr. Christies view of the race. Donald J. Trump has held a comfortable lead, with several candidates bunched up in competition for second place. Those candidates include Mr. Christie and Mr. Rubio, but also the winner of the Iowa caucuses, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. (And most recent polls show Mr. Christie lagging the others.)Mr. Christies main rivals did not embrace his unconventional assessment of the race.I was unaware that Governor Christie resigned to become a fiction writer, said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich.Tim Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, called Mr. Christies declaration of a two-man race extremely wishful thinking on his part.And Joe Pounder, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, said that no amount of hot air or made-up facts can distract from Chris Christies liberal record.On Wednesday, Mr. Christie also implored New Hampshire voters to disregard the results of the Iowa caucuses, warning them that their first-in-the-nation tradition could be at risk if they followed Iowans lead.Mr. Christie also urged voters to resist the notion that the top three Republican finishers in Iowa were who you have to make first, second and third, and that you all in New Hampshire must, like lemmings, follow what happened in Iowa.Dont get run over by the media, please, Mr. Christie said at a town-hall-style meeting at a pub in Lebanon, N.H.He went so far as to suggest that New Hampshires front-and-center role in the presidential nominating process could be jeopardized if voters in the state simply echoed how Iowans weighed in about the candidates.Its time for you all to be engaged to save the New Hampshire primary, he said, because if youre just going to do the same thing Iowa did, then whats the difference?In New Hampshire, Mr. Christie has devoted significant time to campaigning in smaller settings, like town hall meetings. He urged voters to encourage that kind of effort, drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump, who he noted was campaigning in Arkansas on Wednesday, even with New Hampshires primary only days away.Mr. Christie warned the crowd not to reward the guy who comes in on the 757, signs a few hats and leaves."}

{"text": "One was working as an accredited C.P.A. Another had just completed the requirements for a pre-med degree at the University of Chicago. Yet another, a junior employee at Morgan Stanley, walked down 75 flights in the World Trade Centers South Tower and back into the family food business on Sept. 11, 2001.These New Yorkers  Thomas Chen, Jonathan Wu and Wilson Tang  are among a few dozen Chinese-Americans who have recently surfaced as influential chefs, determined to begin a new culinary conversation with the food of their ancestors. Independently, they arrived at the same goal: to invent a kind of Chinese-American food that is modern, creative and delicious instead of sweet, sticky and bland.But they took similar routes to get there. Despite their advanced academic degrees, these chefs started over as culinary students  usually against their families wishes.No Chinese parent sends their child off to college hoping theyll work in a kitchen, said Mr. Chen, 31, whose parents owned a restaurant in Mount Vernon, N.Y., while he was growing up. Thats what you go to college to escape from.They worked their way up in high-end global kitchens like Noma, Guy Savoy, Eleven Madison Park and Jean-Georges. And then, having defied their parents, they defied their culinary training as well. They left the luxurious places where they had mastered foie gras and morels to open storefront restaurants where they can mess around with pork belly and pomelo, steamed eggs and sawtooth herb.In addition to exploring a vast pantry of new ingredients (osmanthus, pandan, celtuce and wood ginger), they are facing a daunting new arsenal of Chinese cooking techniques, entirely different from the skills theyve been schooled in.Its not just recipes that are different, Mr. Chen said. Its basics like how to hold a knife, how to trim an onion, how to boil vegetables.The phenomenon is certainly not confined to New York City, although several of its exemplary restaurants are clustered in Lower Manhattan: Mr. Wus Fung Tu, Mr. Chens Tuome, and Yunnan BBQ from Doron Wong, 39, and Erika Chou, 31.It is also not new. Pioneers like Susanna Foo and Ming Tsai long ago opened ambitious, creative Chinese restaurants that paved the way. More recently Anita Lo, of Annisa in the West Village, has been the spirit guide for many young chefs; her stubborn conviction that Chinese food can flow seamlessly into Western fine dining smoothed the path for this next generation.They include Justin Yu and Karen Man at Oxheart in Houston, Shirley Chung at Twenty Eight in Irvine, Calif., Brandon Jew of the eagerly awaited  Mister Jius in San Francisco, and Sheridan Su of Fat Choy in Las Vegas. In New York, Mission Chinese Food and RedFarm both have a similar spirit and exciting food.There is also a junior class of specialists, like Hannah and Marian Cheng of Mimi Chengs Dumplings in the East Village, where the dumplings are made from sustainable meat and served with farm-to-table vegetable sides from their Taiwanese mothers recipes; the Boba Guys, who use organic milk and house-made syrup in their bubble tea; and Debbie Mullin of Wei Kitchen in Seattle, who makes small-batch shallot and chile oils.Mr. Su is a refugee from fine-dining kitchens on the Las Vegas Strip who started a solo career making bao in a corner of a strip-mall hair salon. His newest venture, Flock & Fowl, is devoted to the classic southern Chinese dish called Hainanese chicken rice, but with upgraded ingredients and innovations like congee topped with fried (free-range) chicken, a poached (organic) egg and (house-made) pickles.Most of these chefs have never been to China and have no Chinese culinary training, so they are learning as they go, synthesizing the values of the kitchens they know (organic, seasonal, soign) with Chinese elements they do not. No one would give me even the lowest kitchen job in Beijing, said Cara Stadler, 28, who grew up in Massachusetts and moved to China with substantial experience in the kitchens of the chefs Guy Savoy and Gordon Ramsay. Instead, she started the citys first underground supper club. Going to the markets every day forced me to really learn about Chinese produce, she said.Ms. Stadler is now the chef and owner of Tao Yuan in Brunswick, Me., where the shellfish are plentiful and exquisite. Next week, for the Lunar New Year, she will be making plump scallop won tons  and then drying the bivalves side muscles to simmer into a homemade XO sauce, a fiery, funky, hugely popular condiment from Hong Kong.Chinese ingredients by themselves are a vast field of study  dried mushrooms, cured meats, salted fish and bean pastes are only the beginning. Most of these chefs grew up without them: Instead, they ate a combination of American snacks, global fast food and the kind of meals a Chinese mother living in Dayton, Ohio, or Avon, Conn., might produce on a Tuesday night in the 1980s: beef stir-fried with romaine lettuce (in the absence of gai lan or bok choy) or fried rice studded with pepperoni instead of sweet lap cheong.Every Chinese family I knew had Dinty Moore beef stew in the pantry, said Mr. Tang, 37, whose family owned real estate and Chinese bakeries in New York City, including the classic Nom Wah Tea Parlor, which he now runs. You throw that in the wok with some soy sauce and chile bean paste, fresh rice from the rice cooker, its not bad.That kind of crude fusion doesnt satisfy them anymore. From cookbooks and childhood memories, and through trial and error, they are feeling their way into one of the worlds most complex, ancient and demanding culinary traditions. So they are making their own five-spice powder, hand-cutting noodles and home-brewing basics like pickled mustard greens, chile bean paste and fermented black beans.And they are hoping to find essentiality  the important modern value idea of making fine, fresh ingredients taste like themselves.Honestly, I thought that was a Japanese thing, said Mr. Wu, of Fung Tu, who spent years working in the kitchen at Per Se. I didnt realize that Chinese food had that, only because Id never had that kind of Chinese food.Mr. Wong, the chef at Yunnan BBQ, who grew up near Boston and trained in Hong Kong, where his family emigrated from, said: Most Americans, including me at some point, have just never had Chinese food. When I went there and saw things like cornmeal wrapped in a banana leaf, or wood-roasted chicken wings, I thought, Am I really that ignorant about my own food?The answer was probably yes. Chinese-American food  mostly Cantonese banquet dishes adjusted for long-outgrown American tastes  is so ingrained here that even Chinese-Americans have come to believe that it is closely related to real Chinese food, when in truth it is a very, very distant cousin.But that is starting to change as different cuisines and cooks arrive here from China, as more Americans travel to China, and as haute cuisine there bounces back from a long dormancy. Traditional (and modern) Chinese restaurants are thriving as the growing middle class and the new availability of ingredients from around the world have generated new demand.Kian Lam Kho, 62, a software engineer turned chef who grew up in Singapore and lives in Harlem, is one of the few people equally at home in the American and Chinese culinary worlds. He returns to Asia frequently, snapping up old and new Chinese-language culinary textbooks as they come back into print. (Restaurants, culinary schools and cookbooks have been common in China since the Song dynasty, about 1000 A.D.) He used these texts to research his magisterial new book, Phoenix Claws and Jade Trees, which details not only the recipes and regions but also the underlying concepts that have been the building blocks of Chinese cooking  and of much East Asian cooking  for thousands of years.He said the book was partly designed to teach English-speaking people of Chinese heritage like these chefs, who may have lost the language of China but not their loyalty to its food.Unless they understand the original dishes, what they cook will never have a real relationship with Chinese food, he said. When they braise the classic red-cooked pork in the oven instead of in a wok, he said, or if they sear the meat first, the way they are taught in Western cooking schools, it changes the flavor, the mouthfeel and how everything works together.Using clam chowder as a reference point, he said, Anyone can take clams, potatoes, salt pork and milk, and make some kind of dish. But if the pork fat is not rendered, if the potatoes are left whole, if the cooking is too fast, it will not be chowder.This new effort to synthesize Chinese and American cuisines takes more study and skill than squirting a few drizzles of soy and hoisin onto Western dishes like grilled steak or mashed potatoes. Those thoughtless mash-ups are why these Chinese-American chefs now shudder at the term Asian fusion and go to great lengths to define what they are doing differently. (They are definitely not tinkering with sushi or dabbling in pad Thai.)The term Chinese-American food has even worse connotations: heavy, sticky, deep-fried.We definitely need to figure out what to call it, said Mr. Tang, who is a partner in Fung Tu.Modern American-Chinese? Chef-driven Chinese-American? Elevated or upscale sounds too snooty, especially when were basically serving ribs and noodles and chicken wings, he said.Another challenge, Mr. Tang said, is to decide whether the cooks supporting them in the kitchen should be graduates of restaurants like Hakkasan, who would have the Chinese skills, or like Gramercy Tavern, who have the fine-dining finesse.What we need is ABCs  American-born Chinese  who speak Chinese but also speak farm-to-table, he said.  And so far, there arent too many of us.Recipe: Spicy Chinese Mustard Chicken Wings"}

Trump has taken issue with a loan the senator received (and did not properly disclose) from Goldman Sachs in 2012.On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz delivered a rebuttal: Thats rich.Arguing that Mr. Trump himself had extensive loans from giant Wall Street banks, Mr. Cruz said the criticism from Mr. Trump, to use a New York term, is the height of chutzpah.And Heidi and I did something that is very novel and unfamiliar to Donald, Mr. Cruz told the crowd at a town hall-style event here.

It has also drawn attention to his wife Heidis job with the firm, from which she has taken an unpaid leave for the campaign.Mr. Cruz was asked Wednesday if his background represented a conflict of interest for someone whose campaign is premised in part on a populist crusade against cronyism.Mr. Cruz took the opportunity to speak in more detail than usual about his wifes business life.What she does is not involved with the government. She is investing money for families in and around Texas, Mr. Cruz said. Shes essentially a stockbroker.He said the family took the loan from Goldman in 2012 because of the wealth of his opponent in the Senate race, David Dewhurst.Its a good thing I never had to run against a rich guy again, he joked.A short while later, Mr. Cruz was interrupted by at least a dozen demonstrators, who seemed to be protesting Mr. Cruzs denial of global warming.You cant win New Hampshire like you won Iowa! one shouted.As they were escorted out, Mr. Cruz paced the stage quietly.Someone has invited the children to the event, he said. And it does seem that these particular children attended the Donald Trump school of debate: If the facts are uncomfortable, simply yell and scream and stomp your feet."}
{"text": "LONDON   The Swiss bank UBS said Tuesday that its profit rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter, bolstered primarily by a tax benefit, as uncertainty in the markets weighed on the results of its wealth management and investment banking businesses.The bank, based in Zurich, reported a profit of 949 million Swiss francs, or about $929 million, for the three months that ended Dec. 31. That is an increase from 858 million francs in the period a year earlier.UBS said the period was characterized by very low levels of client activity and pronounced risk aversion by its customers.The fourth quarter included a tax-related gain of 715 million francs, alongside 365 million francs in charges for litigation and regulatory matters and a 257 million francs charge to repurchase debt.Despite a very challenging environment, we had an excellent year, both in terms of shareholder returns and strengthened client relationships, Sergio P. Ermotti, the UBS chief executive, said in a news release. Going forward, we will continue with the disciplined execution of our strategy while investing for profitable and sustainable growth.UBS warned the underlying macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical risks that have weighed on the markets recently are unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future.Negative market performance and substantial market volatility since the start of 2016, low interest rates, and the relative strength of the Swiss franc, particularly against the euro, continue to present headwinds, UBS said.In the fourth quarter, operating income rose slightly to 6.78 billion francs, from 6.75 billion francs in the same period a year earlier. Operating expenses increased to 6.54 billion francs, from 6.34 billion francs in the fourth quarter of 2014.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined to 1.76 billion francs in the quarter, from 1.87 billion francs in the same period a year earlier.In recent years, UBS has shrunk its investment bank and shifted its focus to wealth management, an area it sees as more consistently profitable, but which was hit hard by turbulence in the markets in the fourth quarter.In the wealth management division, UBS said pretax profit declined to 344 million francs in the period, from 646 million francs in the fourth quarter of 2014.UBS said that its wealth management business saw 3.4 billion francs in net new money outflows in the fourth quarter.The wealth management business in the Americas, which is operated separately, reported a pretax profit of $13 million in the fourth quarter, from $217 million in the same period a year earlier.UBSs investment bank posted a pretax profit of 80 million francs in the period, from 217 million francs in the fourth quarter of 2014."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   The Obama administration said on Tuesday that it would ask Congress to spend an additional $1.1 billion next year to combat a growing epidemic of prescription painkiller and heroin abuse.Almost half of the new money would be used to expand treatment facilities, which are in short supply in much of the nation.Opioid abuse and overdoses have hurt families from across this nation, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said in a news conference. My home state of West Virginia has felt the cost almost more than any other.The other half of the money would go to programs intended to prevent prescription drug overdoses, crack down on illegal sales, and improve access to naloxone, a drug that can rescue those who have overdosed.The announcement reflected the administrations growing concerns about one of the few public health epidemics to substantially worsen during President Obamas tenure. Opioids, which include prescription painkillers and heroin, were involved in 28,648 deaths in the United States in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drugs were a bigger killer than motor vehicle crashes.The administrations efforts to combat the toll have been modest and largely ineffective. The epidemic has leveled off somewhat, but it shows no signs of abating, leading addiction experts to complain about Mr. Obamas response.In Tuesdays news conference, Michael P. Botticelli, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, defended the administrations actions.We have made some progress, but we need to do more, particularly as it relates to people accessing treatment, Mr. Botticelli said.The administration hopes Congress will allocate $460 million next year for states to fund medication-assisted treatment for opioid abuse. While such programs are opposed by some officials and advocates, who say that the medications merely lead to another form of addiction, studies show that they are effective. States would receive funding based on the severity of the epidemic and the strength of their strategy to combat it.In October, Mr. Obama issued a presidential memorandum requiring federal doctors to receive more training in prescribing opioids. In December, he signed a budget agreement that provided $400 million to fight the opioid epidemic, an increase of $100 million over the previous year.Efforts to combat the opioid epidemic try to strike a balance between preventing addicts from getting inappropriate prescriptions and ensuring that cancer and surgical patients and others with severe pain can quickly receive the treatment they need.Mr. Obama traveled to Charleston, W.Va., in October to hear from addicts, their parents and police officers about the epidemics effect on communities, and he spoke in personal terms about how he could have been similarly affected himself.I did stuff, and Ive been very honest about it, he said, referring to his admissions of illegal drug use in his youth. So when I think about it, there but for the grace of God.In his final State of the Union address last month, Mr. Obama mentioned helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse as one of the few areas of common ground between Democrats and Republicans.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who has sponsored legislation to combat the opioid epidemic, said in a statement Tuesday that if the White House is serious about fighting the heroin epidemic, Mr. Obama would support his bill.In response, Mr. Botticelli said that the administration would continue to work with lawmakers. We agree with the intent of the legislation in that we really need a comprehensive response, he said."}

{"text": "CHEMCHINA MAKES $43 BILLION OFFER FOR SYNGENTA  |  China National Chemical Corporation offered to buy Syngenta, one of the worlds biggest manufacturers of agricultural chemicals and seeds, for more than $43 billion, Chad Bray and Amie Tsang report in DealBook.The state-owned ChemChina would pay $465 a share and a special dividend of five Swiss francs, or about $4.90, upon closing  a 22 percent premium to Syngentas closing price on Tuesday.Syngentas board, which rejected a takeover from Monsanto last year, said it was unanimously recommending that shareholders accept the deal.Syngenta would remain based in Switzerland and continue to be run by its existing management.The transaction would be the largest acquisition of a foreign company by a Chinese firm and comes after a string of deals from one of Chinas largest chemical companies.The purchase could help China revolutionize its agriculture sector and accelerate the countrys push for food independence, but there could be questions about giving a Chinese company control of Syngenta, as Leslie Picker and Chad Bray report in DealBook.The acquisition could face lengthy scrutiny in Europe and the United States, where Syngenta has a significant presence. But the deal offers Syngenta a degree of independence it wouldnt have had in a deal with the American agricultural giant Monsanto.YAHOO SEEKS TO STREAMLINE  |  Yahoo said it was open to offers for its core assets, but it was also proceeding with plans to spin out these core assets,\nDavid Streitfeld reports in The New York Times.

Some, including Verizon, have already expressed their interest. \nYahoo remains a marginally profitable company, but it is not growing.

{"text": "Still licking his wounds from losing the Iowa caucuses, Donald J. Trump is rolling out a new advertisement that ditches his gloom and doom about the dire state of America in favor of a more positive message.Titled Voter Voices, Mr. Trumps first new ad since the caucuses features a diverse set of supporters embracing his plan to Make America Great Again.Mr. Trumps hard-line plans on immigration and the surveillance of American Muslims have led some to suggest that his appeal could be limited to white voters. And his controversial comments about women have raised questions about his ability to count on them voting for him in large numbers, especially in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.However, the ad features women, African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics singing Mr. Trumps praises.I came to hear Mr. Trumps business plan for America, one man says.Mr. Trump often bemoans how far the United States has fallen, but in this case he is more upbeat.We have a country that we are proud of and that we love that we are not going to lose, Mr. Trump says.The ad also addresses a pet peeve of Mr. Trumps  that the news media ignores the large crowds at his rallies. The footage is full of sweeping shots with vast audiences of adoring fans."}

{"text": "Francisco Flores, a former president of El Salvador who was facing charges of diverting $15 million in contributions for earthquake victims to his personal and political party accounts, died on Jan. 30 in San Salvador. He was 56.His death, of a cerebral hemorrhage, was announced by the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, the conservative party that has controlled the presidency for two decades, beginning in 1989.Mr. Flores had been under house arrest since November 2014.He was accused of illegal enrichment by embezzling donations from the Taiwanese government that were intended for earthquake survivors in 2001. Taiwan was grateful to El Salvador for supporting Taiwans application for membership in the United Nations.In December, a Salvadoran judge ordered Mr. Flores to stand trial on charges of pocketing $5 million personally and disbursing $10 million to his partys coffers. He insisted that the money had been distributed properly to deserving victims. Despite Mr. Floress death, the authorities are likely to pursue civil litigation to recover the funds.When he was inaugurated for a five-year term in 1999 at the age of 39, Mr. Flores, a philosopher and an accomplished horse trainer, was the youngest president in the Americas. He was considered the most pro-United States leader in the Western Hemisphere.Francisco Guillermo Flores Prez was born in Santa Ana, El Salvador, on Oct. 17, 1959, to Ulises Flores, an economist, and the former Maria Leonor Prez.He graduated with a degree in political science from Amherst College in Massachusetts, and studied at Harvard University and Trinity College at Oxford University.He is survived by his wife, the former Lourdes Rodrguez, and their two children, Juan Marco and Gabriela.He became a vice minister in 1989, during the presidency of Alfredo Cristiani, and was instrumental in drafting a new constitution after a cease-fire with left-wing guerrilla groups in 1992 brokered by the United Nations. He was elected to the unicameral National Assembly in 1994 and was chosen as its president in 1997.In the legislature, he earned a reputation as a peacemaker. But that was belied during the presidential campaign, when he refused to engage his opponent, a former guerrilla commander, in a debate, as well as during his presidency, when he was accused of ruling imperiously.After he was elected, Mr. Flores paid homage to a founder of his party, Roberto dAubuisson, a cashiered National Guard officer suspected in several apparent right-wing murders, including the killing of Archbishop scar Romero in 1980, during the countrys civil war.Lets remember the values of our founder, Mr. Flores declared.His term was marred by two major earthquakes and a drought. He also endured an unpopular adoption of the United States dollar as El Salvadors official currency."}
{"text": "To the Editor:As terror continues to wash over Israel, claiming more lives, the people in my country were surprised to find another infuriating statement by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Dont Shoot the Messenger, Israel (Op-Ed, Feb. 1).Throughout the United Nations history, terror attacks have received harsh and unequivocal condemnation from its secretaries general. Many times they were followed by Security Council resolutions. Only when it comes to Israel, however, is terrorism  like the murder of a mother in front of her children last month  denounced with ifs and buts.The secretary general writes that history proves that people will always resist occupation. Nothing can justify the murder of 30 innocent Israelis since last September. His statement legitimizes the Palestinian Authoritys incitement to terror and violence.If Mr. Ban is looking for the factors leading to terror, he should listen to the terrorists themselves, who have admitted that it is the hate-filled programming on the Palestinian Authoritys official TV that inspires them to stab and murder.When it comes to the situation in my region, the United Nations must focus its efforts to stop terror and incitement in order to cultivate a prosperous ground for peace.DANNY DANONAmbassador and PermanentRepresentative of Israel to the U.N.New YorkTo the Editor:Ban Ki-moon writes that along with the United States, the European Union and the Russian Federation, the United Nations is calling for substantial changes in policy to strengthen the economic, institutional and security pillars of the Palestinian Authority. The secretary general might have been more clear on this point given the absence of such support from our Republican-led legislative branch.The fact is that the world community is in direct conflict with American legislators on this matter, the exact same dynamic featured in the recent Iran deal. Given that a two-state solution has been the policy of every American administration, Republican or Democratic, for years, our Congresss mindless opposition to stateless and suffering Palestinians will only assure less American international leadership at a time when our G.O.P. decries just that.ERIC R.

{"text": "There are things that bother Isaiah Thomas, things that most N.B.A. players, most N.B.A. All-Stars, do not ever have to worry about.Ill give you an example, Thomas said after lacing his sneakers at a recent practice. A guy scores on me, and its like, Oh, hes too small, a liability. A guy scores on a 6-2 guy, and its like, That was a good shot. It seems as if it has always been that way for Thomas, the Boston Celtics 5-foot-9 point guard, forever the smallest player on the court, perpetually seeking respect.Last week, Thomas was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The selection was another moment of validation, another example of how he has embraced the doubters to use as motivation.You do the same thing that a guy whos 6-1 or 6-2 does, but theres still always a question, Thomas said. No matter what level youre at, its always Well, he probably cant do that at the next level. Why is it always a question?Being a small player can be a burden in the N.B.A., but it also enters you into a small fraternity. Out of the thousands of players to have appeared in an N.B.A. game, only 23 were 5 feet 9 or shorter, and only 11 appeared in more than 100 games.Thomas, 26, said one motivating factor was dispelling for younger players the notion that short guards cannot contribute. And in the same way, he acknowledged a debt to the undersize men who played before him.Muggsy Bogues, at 5-3 the shortest player in the leagues history, has become a mentor and sounding board of sorts for Thomas since the two met years ago, when Thomas was still at the University of Washington.Bogues said they spoke on the phone often when Thomas, who was drafted by the Sacramento Kings and had a brief stint with the Phoenix Suns, was traded to the Celtics last year and was unsure how the move would work out.He was coming off the bench, and he was feeling some kind of way about that, Bogues said. I said: Keep making the guys better, keep being a pest on defense, and most importantly, keep doing what you do: Youre a scorer. Thomas has become the main engine of the ascendant Celtics. This season he has distinguished himself as one of basketballs elite scorers. On Tuesday night against the Knicks, Thomas scored a game-high 20 points in the Celtics 97-89 win while adding 8 assists and 5 rebounds.Thomas uses quickness and deception to elude defenders. He has an acrobats body control at the hoop.Thomas said he borrowed his signature move  a half-turn, fake-360 hesitation dribble  from watching Dennis Chism, a player on the AND1 Mixtape Tour who was better known as Spyda, while Thomas was growing up.He finds gaps that other players can, manipulating his body around the rim, absorbing contact and managing to finish, Knicks center Robin Lopez said of Thomas.Lopez added with a smile, I just think about how hard I have to try night in and night out to score, and Im 7 foot, 7 foot 1.Thomas, the 60th and final selection in the 2011 draft, is, according to ESPN, the lowest-picked player to make an All-Star team since 1989, when the draft contracted to two rounds. Along with Calvin Murphy, a 5-9 guard who played from 1970 to 1983, Thomas is the shortest player to be picked for an All-Star team.Murphy has met Thomas on a couple of occasions and has otherwise admired his game from afar. Murphy said it was necessary for him, as an undersize player, to have a bullish mentality, a surplus of confidence. He said he saw that in Thomas.I had a chip on my shoulder, a Napoleon complex, and I was coming at you, Murphy said. I could do anything the big boys did. I could dunk the way they dunked. I could shoot as well as anyone. My ball-handling was superb. It sounds like Im egotistical, and I am.Murphy, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993, said he thought Thomas would become a superstar. I love his game face, he said. I see hes got the Calvin Murphy syndrome.Thomas has tried to hone that mental approach and has recently become obsessed with the martial artist Bruce Lee, who was 5-7. Lee, like Thomas, attended Washington. Thomas watched Lees movies and clips on YouTube and contemplates his inspirational quotes.When Thomas returns home to the Pacific Northwest this off-season, he would like to visit Lees grave site in Seattle.He was so mentally locked in to everything he did, and he did it his own way, Thomas said. This summer I just tried to study the things he did and how he focused. The best players have the best mentality. You cant break them no matter what situation theyre in.Thomas has accepted guidance and inspiration from all over. Growing up, he was a fan of Damon Stoudamire, a 5-10 point guard from Portland. He watched tape of Stoudamires highlights and marveled at how much of his game he had absorbed into his own.Gary Payton, a Hall of Fame point guard, encouraged Thomas to work on his defensive game, telling him his low center of gravity was an advantage.One of Thomass closest confidantes in recent years has been Floyd Mayweather Jr., a 38-year-old boxer who stands 5-8. The unlikely friendship came from a chance meeting.In the summer of 2010, Thomas accepted an invitation from a mutual friend to watch Mayweather train at his gym in Las Vegas. Mayweather, a basketball fan, requested that Thomas call him later that day.I called him, Thomas said, and he was like, Do you want to go to a Robin Thicke concert?  I was like, I mean, I guess so. He said, Ill be outside your hotel in five minutes. Mayweather picked up Thomas, and the two hit it off right away. It was nice, Thomas said of the concert. He was talking the whole time, so I didnt really get to listen to Robin Thicke. But it was nice.Thomas said he and Mayweather texted or spoke about every other day. Mayweather attended a recent Celtics game and afterward accompanied Thomas to dinner. They stayed at the restaurant talking until 4 a.m.He tries to help me when it comes to my mentality, thinking like Im the best, preparing like Im the best, Thomas said.Thomas will be among the best players when he arrives at the All-Star Game this month. He exhibited a measure of the boxers bombast when he described the feeling of validation.Now Im starting to get the respect that I feel like I deserve, Thomas said. And its about time."}
{"text": "LONDON   The European Union offered a proposal on Tuesday intended to keep Britain as a member of the bloc, setting out compromises on hot-button issues like immigration and setting up a referendum as early as this summer on whether the country wants to retain close ties to the Continent or go its own way.The proposal, drafted by the European Council president, Donald Tusk, addressed all the issues that Prime Minister David Cameron had insisted be revisited if he was to campaign to keep Britain in the union. But it remained vague on some crucial points, and in any case was unlikely to sway those most committed to Britains exit from the bloc.Mr. Camerons task in the months before the referendum is to rally enough supporters of continued membership and win over enough of those on the fence to avert a vote to leave, a choice that many predict could have global ramifications.Written after weeks of diplomacy, the dense texts still need to be approved by leaders of the other 27 members of the bloc, who, along with Britain, will meet for a crucial summit meeting in Brussels this month. A deal there could pave the way for a British referendum as early as June.Not only would a British exit from the bloc cause acute economic uncertainty in and beyond Britain, it could also trigger an existential crisis for the union, which has struggled in vain to react coherently to a growing wave of migration from the Middle East and elsewhere.Mr. Cameron has said that he wants to negotiate a better deal from the bloc, one that would then allow him to campaign for the country to stay. On Tuesday, speaking in Chippenham, England, Mr. Cameron called the new plan a very strong and powerful package, adding that, while there was no final agreement and more work was needed, strong, determined and patient negotiation has achieved a good outcome for Britain.Immediate reaction was divided along well-established lines, with critics of the European Union denouncing the proposals as insubstantial.Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, called them truly pathetic. Steve Baker, a Conservative Party lawmaker who also wants Britain to quit the bloc, said that nothing in it would stand up to serious scrutiny.But Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, described the offer as an important milestone on the way to a deal that could deliver positive changes to the E.U. that will benefit not just the U.K., but the whole of Europe.Significantly, one senior euroskeptic figure in Mr. Camerons Conservative Party, Home Secretary Theresa May, signaled cautious support for the plan on Tuesday, describing it a basis for a deal.The most delicate issue on the table was Mr. Camerons call for the right to restrict welfare benefits for non-British citizens of European Union countries, namely by limiting access to in work payments that typically supplement the earnings of low-wage employees.These curbs could apply for up to four years, and the documents published on Tuesday state that the scale of immigration into Britain would justify them. However, it also stipulated that there would need to be a final agreement among the 28 nations for the restrictions to kick in.Plans would also be drawn to reduce the child benefit payments to workers whose children have not accompanied them to Britain. This plan would involve Britain paying a lower amount based on costs in the nation where the child lives.Mr. Camerons welfare proposals were seen by some nations, most notably in Eastern Europe, as a breach of the principle that all European Union citizens should be treated equally.In a letter accompanying the release of the documents, Mr. Tusk defended his attempt to balance British demands against the sensitivities of other countries. To my mind, it goes really far in addressing all the concerns raised by Prime Minister Cameron, Mr. Tusk wrote. The line I did not cross, however, were the principles on which the European project is founded.In a Twitter post, Tomas Prouza, the Czech minister for European affairs, described the mechanism as acceptable but said there would be a crucial debate over how long the restrictions would apply.Mr. Tusks proposals also offered assurances to Mr. Cameron that a treaty commitment to ever closer union among the peoples of Europe would not bind Britain to the goal of political union.Instead the proposals argued that this was compatible with different paths of integration, does not compel all Member States to aim for a common destination and allows for an evolution towards a deeper degree of integration among the Member States that share such a vision of their common future, without this applying to other Member States.Another proposal ensured safeguards for the large financial sector in Britain, which decided to keep the pound rather than adopt the euro. The British government worries that, as the 19 nations that use the single currency integrate further, rules might be skewed against European Union nations that do not.Offering such guarantees to Britain is sensitive in some eurozone nations, such as France.In another concession, European Union legislation could be blocked if enough national parliaments oppose a measure, though critics doubt that that would be easy to deploy.Mr. Camerons enthusiasm for the plan is crucial because those who want Britain to stay in the bloc believe his opinion will prove decisive with the public in a referendum.He argues that, inside Europes single market, but outside its euro single currency and the passport-free Schengen travel zone, Britain could have the best of both worlds if it succeeds in its negotiation.Britain voted in 1975 to stay in what was then called the European Economic Community, which it had joined two years earlier, but has held no plebiscites on European issues since.On Tuesday Mr. Cameron said that, providing that the deal is reached, he would not argue that the European Union is now a perfect and unblemished organization but that on balance, Britain is better off inside it."}
{"text": "CHICAGO  The state-appointed emergency manager of the Detroit Public Schools, who had also managed the city of Flint and oversaw its decision to draw its water from the Flint River, resigned on Tuesday, the day before a congressional committee hearing in Washington on Flints water.Michelle Zdrodowski, a spokeswoman for Detroit Public Schools, said the manager, Darnell Earley, had declined to testify before a panel investigating the widespread contamination of Flints tap water after the city switched its water source, which led to elevated blood lead levels throughout the city.On Tuesday evening, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena for Mr. Earley to testify on Wednesday, but his lawyer, A. Scott Bolden, said Mr. Earley would not be able to appear.Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement, Mr. Earley has a right to assert the Fifth Amendment, but his abrupt resignation earlier today and his refusal to testify before the committee make it even more urgent that we hear directly from the governor as soon as possible about this escalating scandal.Mr. Earley was appointed to the Flint and Detroit management positions by Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican. His oversight has come under scrutiny, both for his support of switching water sources, which triggered its current public health crisis, and for the condition of the Detroit Public Schools, which have been hit by a series of teacher sickouts in protest of the districts conditions.Last week, the Detroit teachers union sued the Detroit Public Schools and Mr. Earley, arguing that under his management, he allowed the schools to deteriorate to the point of crisis.In a letter to Governor Snyder dated Tuesday, Mr. Earley wrote that his resignation will be effective Feb. 29. While there is still much work yet to be done, he said, he believed his work had helped lead the school district to long-term financial health.Mr. Earley also said he had developed a plan that would eventually help the district return to some form of local control  a sore point with many residents, who unwillingly surrendered that control.Mr. Earley inherited a school system already suffering from low academic achievement, declining enrollment, crumbling buildings and in financial distress. The system is in so much debt it could be insolvent by spring.His appointment as the Detroit school systems emergency manager in January 2015 followed two years in which he played a similar role in Flint at the behest of Mr. Snyder.In a statement, the governor praised Mr. Earley for doing a very good job under some very difficult circumstances.He restructured a heavily bureaucratic central office, set in place operating and cost-containment measures, and has taken steps to stabilize enrollment, he said.Mr. Snyder said he would appoint a transition leader by the end of the month.Mr. Earleys departure was announced on the same day that federal officials said the F.B.I. was investigating how Flint, a city of nearly 100,000 people, had failed to provide clean water. Failure to treat the water from the Flint River caused the pipes to corrode, leading to the leaching of lead and other toxic chemicals into the system. Residents are using filters and bottled water for drinking, cooking and, in some cases, bathing.The United States attorneys office, the Postal Inspection Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and a task force appointed by the governor have already started investigations. The F.B.I.s involvement could indicate that criminal acts are suspected.On Tuesday, Karen Weaver, the mayor of Flint, called for the lead pipes in the citys water system to be removed immediately, starting with the homes that have the highest recorded levels of lead.Ms. Zdrodowski, the Detroit schools spokeswoman, said Mr. Earley was not available for an interview.Mr. Earley was the fourth emergency manager for the school system since 2009. His resignation was hailed as a victory for Detroit teachers..He was a very tight-lipped agent of the governor, said Steve Conn, a former president of the Detroit teachers union.Mr. Conn said he told his fellow teachers last year that the only way we would get anywhere with Earley or Snyder was by mobilizing in the street."}

Cook the pasta in well-salted water (this is key!), then save some of the water when you drain it off. Toss the cooked pasta in a warm bowl with a pat or two of unsalted butter, a handful of crumbled blue cheese and a corresponding amount of walnuts. Add some of that reserved cooking water, then shower with black pepper and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Dinner is served.Want an actual recipe to follow? Were liking this recipe for spicy chicken wings with Chinese mustard, which Julia Moskin picked up from the chef Jonathan Wu at Fung Tu in New York during her reporting for an excellent new piece on the rise of a new group of modern, chef-driven Chinese restaurants.Julias piece is in the Times Food section that we delivered to stoops, porches and front drives across America this morning. Accompanying it is a fine article by David Karp on the rise of the mandarin orange, which we know more commonly as the tangerine. American consumption of mandarins has exploded: Were up to five pounds per person a year. David helps make sense of what were buying and when and why the fruit is best.No to pasta? Not up for frying wings? How about some stir-fried green beans with chiles and tofu? The recipe is Martha Rose Shulmans, written for use after a trip to the summer farmers market. But substituting a bag of frozen green beans at this time of year is no crime, and the eatings terrific.Or maybe some roasted salmon with brown sugar and mustard? Or a bowl of glazed shiitakes with bok choy? Pair that with rice.Cooking has plenty of other options to cook tonight or in coming days if none of todays options light your fires.

{"text": "WASHINGTON   Two senior military leaders said Tuesday that women should be required to register for the draft now that the Pentagon had opened all combat roles to them.Although the move would be largely symbolic  the draft has not been used since the Vietnam War  it would represent another step in the militarys shift toward viewing men and women as equals.At a Senate hearing on women in combat, Gen. Robert B. Neller, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said he believed that every American whos physically qualified should register for the draft. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army chief of staff, said he agreed.And the acting secretary of the Army, Patrick J. Murphy, encouraged Congress to look into the matter, saying it should be a national debate.The officials had been asked their views by Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who said she was in favor of having women register.Part of me believes that asking women to register as we ask men to register would maybe possibly open up more recruits as women began to think about, well, the military is an option for me, Ms. McCaskill said.It is unclear whether Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter supports the idea; a spokesman did not return an email seeking comment. Mr. Carter announced in December that all military roles would be opened to women.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said it was not an official administration position that women be required to register.Under the current system, all men ages 18 to 26 living in the United States are required to register for the draft with the federal governments Selective Service System. Those registrations create a pool of men who could be pressed into service if the country needed tens of thousands of troops to fight a war.The military ended the draft in 1973. From 1975 to 1980, men were not required to register with the Selective Service. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter reinstated it.Congress would probably need to pass a law to make military service compulsory, as it was during the Vietnam War and both world wars. If women were required to register, it is unclear exactly how a draft would be carried out.Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus of military history at the University of North Carolina, said mandating that women register would send a message that commanders were increasingly seeing men and women as the same.If you are going to levy that on men, you better levy it on women, Mr. Kohn said. Every occupation in the military is open to women, so they should have equal obligation to serve.When Mr. Carter announced the reinstatement of the Selective Service in 1980, he said that registration for the draft was needed to increase preparedness and demonstrate the nations resolve. It will improve our capacity, if circumstances require, to increase the size and strength of our armed forces  and that capacity will itself help to maintain peace and to prevent conflict in the region of the Persian Gulf and Southwest Asia, he said.At the time, Mr. Carter asked Congress to allow women to register and serve. But lawmakers rejected the idea."}
{"text": "The number of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement actions and financial penalties declined sharply last year, but the federal government has signaled that it plans to bolster its efforts in pursuing corporate bribery cases, according to a new report by the law firm Jones Day.In 2015, the Justice Department settled cases with only two companies and collected $24.2 million in penalties  far less than in 2014, when the agency brought 10 corporate enforcement actions and collected $1.25 billion.Last years activity, the lowest since 2004, was attributed to fewer instances of cases stemming from corporations self-reporting suspicious behavior, a smaller number of big-dollar settlements and a focus on more complicated, higher value bribery cases, which take longer to investigate, according to the report.In November, the Justice Department indicated that it planned to double the number of prosecutors focusing on such foreign bribery cases. That followed an announcement last March that the number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to look into such cases will be tripled, according to the report, the second one Jones Day has issued annually on the enforcement of the anticorruption law.The law bars giving anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business with a government entity.The Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles such cases civilly, resolved 10 enforcement actions against corporations last year, settling them for $75,000 to $25 million, and two cases against individuals, according to the report. That was nearly the same as 2014.In 2015, both federal agencies collected $140 million in fines and disgorgements, which is less than a tenth of the amount received in 2014, a near record year at $1.57 billion, and less than a fifth of the $720 million collected in 2013, according to figures provided in the report.The decline is largely due to the absence of settlements above $25 million. In 2014, the near-record total was due to the resolution of four settlements above $100 million, said Hank B. Walther, an author of the report, who is a former government prosecutor and currently a Jones Day partner who defends multinational companies in such cases.The Justice Department indicated last year that it intended to hold more individuals to account for illegal bribery, which can be hard to establish definitively because it requires prosecutors to pinpoint when conduct crosses the line between routine business practices and an illegal action.Even so, the department announced guilty pleas last year by individuals in connection with each of its two corporate bribery enforcement actions, and obtained prison sentences for several former executives who had pleaded guilty.At the same time, the report found, corporations increasingly face multiple investigations across borders for the same conduct. Outside of the United States, other countries are being increasingly active in pressing anticorruption cases.

His resignation comes amid calls for universities to be more transparent about sexual harassment in their science departments, where women account for only one-quarter of senior faculty jobs.The professor, Jason Lieb, 43, made unwelcome sexual advances to several female graduate students at an off-campus retreat of the molecular biosciences division, according to a university investigation letter obtained by The New York Times, and engaged in sexual activity with a student who was incapacitated due to alcohol and therefore could not consent.Dr. Lieb, who has received millions of dollars in federal grants over the last decade, did not respond to requests for comment.In light of the severity and pervasiveness of Professor Liebs conduct, and the broad, negative impact the conduct has had on the educational and work environment of students, faculty and staff, I recommend that the university terminate Professor Liebs academic appointment, reads the letter, signed by Sarah Wake, assistant provost and director of the office for equal opportunity programs.Dr. Lieb stepped down last month before any action was taken.Both the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology have fielded criticism recently for failing to publicly acknowledge their own conclusions that a prominent male scientist on each faculty had harassed female students until the details were uncovered by news media. A third case was reportedly unearthed only because of a bureaucratic error at the University of Arizona.Although institutions proclaim that they have zero tolerance for abuse of the policies that they claim to enforce, too often their primary concern seems to be secrecy and reputation management, the science journal Nature wrote in a Jan. 20 editorial headlined Harassment Victims Deserve Better.At Chicago, students praised the university for swift and decisive action. But some students and faculty members also raised pointed questions about whether the university had placed female graduate students at risk by hiring Dr. Lieb, who brought scientific cachet and a record of winning lucrative grants to a department that had recently lost two of its stars to other institutions.He was put on staff despite potential warning signs.Before he was hired, molecular biologists on the University of Chicago faculty and at other academic institutions received emails from an anonymous address stating that Dr. Lieb had faced allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct at previous jobs at Princeton and the University of North Carolina.Both U.N.C. and Princeton launched investigations, the email read.Yoav Gilad, a molecular biologist at Chicago who was on the committee that advocated hiring Dr. Lieb, said he and his fellow faculty members knew that in February 2014 Dr. Lieb had abruptly resigned from Princeton University, just seven months after having been recruited from the University of North Carolina to run a high-profile genomics institute.But Dr. Gilad said that when it was contacted, Princeton said there had been no sexual harassment investigation of Dr. Lieb while he was there. He said efforts to find out more about what prompted Dr. Liebs departure proved fruitless. A Princeton spokeswoman said the university does not comment on personnel matters.Faculty at Chicago said that Dr. Lieb had told them during the interview process that Princeton faulted him for not informing them about a complaint of unwanted contact filed against him at North Carolina, where he had taught for 13 years. But he told them he had seen no reason to do so because the investigation had not found evidence to support the claim.Subsequently, he gave permission to Princeton to examine his personnel file. Chicago, too, received permission to look at the file, Dr. Gilad said, adding that the examination of the records did not raise red flags.Separately, Dr. Gilad acknowledged, during the interviews of Dr. Lieb, he admitted that he had had a monthslong affair with a graduate student in his laboratory at the University of North Carolina.At Chicago, the hiring committee struggled, Dr. Gilad said, to balance a desire to protect students with a desire not to convict someone without evidence. He said Dr. Lieb had not been found guilty of any offense at North Carolina. The department of human genetics voted unanimously to hire him.Its hard to say this in retrospect, Dr. Gilad said, but whats the value of investigating anything if an unsubstantiated allegation itself invalidates the candidate?But Joe Thornton, a faculty member in the department who raised objections before the vote, said in an interview, I dont think thats the right standard to use. He added, It may be a legal standard, but we should be capable of making more nuanced judgments about the environment were creating for human beings that are doing and learning science.Chicago, North Carolina and Princeton declined to answer questions about the details of the North Carolina case.Universities say they need to protect victims of harassment from being identified and that there are also cases of false accusations. Some universities may be subject to state laws that prohibit the disclosure of certain information. They may sign nondisclosure agreements with departing employees to avoid tarnishing each others reputation, legal experts said.Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, is considering introducing legislation to compel schools to disclose any sexual harassment record of faculty members when they are changing jobs, though it is not clear how the measure will fare.Some Chicago students, too, say they believe there should be a record shared among universities.Even if they did a full investigation and didnt find anything, notes should be available to potential employers, said Erin Fry, a graduate student in Chicagos department of human genetics. They say its to protect privacy, but in the case of sexual misconduct it just protects people like Jason Lieb.Dr. Liebs behavior at Chicago became widely known because it took place in part at a crowded party attended by dozens of graduate students and several faculty members. As students returned to campus from the resort in Galena, Ill., where the retreat was held, faculty and staff received multiple harassment complaints that universities are obligated to investigate under the federal law that guarantees all students equal access to education.Many of the graduate students at the party would have been candidates to work in Dr. Liebs laboratory; some already had. Ms. Wake scheduled a meeting with graduate students on Wednesday to discuss the findings.Informed by a reporter about the circumstances under which Dr. Lieb had resigned from Chicago, William Kier, the chairman of the biology department at North Carolina during the time that Dr. Lieb was under investigation, said he was dismayed. He could not comment on personnel issues, he said."}
{"text": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who should be using his power to make New York City more hospitable to working-class and middle-class families, has instead slipped a little poison into his executive budget that could cripple the citys ambitious efforts to build affordable housing.Housing is the centerpiece of Mayor Bill de Blasios agenda. He has promised to build or preserve 200,000 affordable apartments over 10 years  a tough proposition under the best of circumstances. It could be even tougher now that the governor has proposed placing new layers of state control over the citys use of federal tax-exempt bonds to build and preserve affordable rental apartments. Its not a stretch to call this sabotage.Mr. Cuomo says its transparency and accountability, but it is more about intrusion and control. It would give the head of the Empire State Development Corporation, a Cuomo appointee, the power to sign off on the flow of tax-exempt bonds to New York City, which uses them almost exclusively for affordable housing. It would also require that every single affordable-housing project in New York City that uses the bonds get the approval of the Public Authorities Control Board, a shadowy entity controlled by the governor and the leaders of the Assembly and Senate.These are the proverbial three men in a room who hold a death grip on policy-making power in New York State government. The phrase evokes the low-minded, chronically corrupt jockeying and deal-making that govern how the Albany game is played. That two of the three  Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos  were ejected from the room last year, because of federal felony convictions, is about all you need to know.The Cuomo plan has angered the de Blasio administration, City Council members and nonprofit housing organizations, who call it pointless and harmful. The citys Housing Development Corporation, created in 1971, has long been a transparent and effective steward of the precious federal financing  between $650 million and $900 million a year in recent years  that it has leveraged with tax credits and other resources in a system that has built or preserved 125,000 affordable apartments over the last 12 years. If the system came under Albanys thumb, it would be plagued by delays and uncertainty. Lenders would not lend, developers would not build, projects would collapse, the citys control over its own housing agenda would be thrown into turmoil.Even the big developers are saying as much: The Real Estate Board of New York said Mr. Cuomos meddling threatens the clarity and predictability that builders and banks rely on. The proposed increased oversight could mean uncertainty for builders and lenders and thus negatively affect the creation of new affordable, below-market rental housing that New York City so desperately needs, the boards president, John Banks III, said in a statement.If Mr. Cuomo were serious about solving the affordable housing crisis, he would not be trying to pull the Housing Development Corporation into Albanys tractor beam. He would be doing everything he could to help Mr. de Blasio fulfill his housing pledge. Mr. Cuomo said in his State of the State address last month that the state would spend $20 billion to build 100,000 affordable units over five years  but no one has seen the details of that plan, and now his oversight proposals threaten to drag everything backward.If it aint broke, dont fix it, Mr. de Blasio said last week, testifying in the State Legislature. He said it almost plaintively. Mr. Cuomo, regrettably, has the power to break almost anything he wants."}
{"text": "An Oversimplified DebateRe Israels image issue (Jan. 29): Roger Cohen identifies one of the most widespread but least discussed causes behind a shift against Israel on college campuses, namely a way of thinking which considers all forms of oppression, (racism, sexism, colonialism, etc.) fundamentally interconnected. This theory, known as intersectionality, has gained popular appeal among students, especially among activist circles and the left.As tempting as it is to reduce complicated and longstanding conflicts to digestible categories and the familiar roles of victim and oppressor, its intellectually dishonest and serves only to exacerbate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, foremost by denying Palestinian leadership their autonomy.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including all its actors and parties, deserves to be debated, analyzed and criticized without being subsumed into a simplified catch-all campaign against oppression and injustice.Michael Snow, BerlinDont Close Denmarks DoorsRe Danish law is passed to seize assets of refugees (News, Jan. 28): The refugee policy adopted by the Danish Parliament last week is shameful and degrading, a most worrying victory for a xenophobic mentality so different from the values that have made Denmark a beacon of humanity in the darkness for centuries. French Huguenots, starving Poles, Jews, Arabs, Vietnamese, Iranians, Sudanese, Somalis  the door of this country was always open.I am the Danish grandson of these refugees and I am saddened by the meanness of heart that seems to prevail. Of course, one needs to manage immigration properly, but not at the expense of dignity. We must remain humane. Intelligently, not stupidly, humane. We owe it to those in need, and to ourselves.Alex Balkin, Nice, FranceJordans Aid for RefugeesLet us spare a moment for Syrias neighboring countries like Jordan, a tiny desert kingdom with scant natural resources that is nevertheless at the forefront of international humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts. Jordan currently shelters more than 635,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict. Over the past decades, it has received more than two million Palestinians.In comparison, the response from the international community has been sluggish. But Britain now has an opportunity to help Jordan in its hour of need. As Queen Rania put it: Each one of us has to try to do something, because at the end of the day we are human beings. A little empathy would lead to compassion, and compassion will compel us to act.Munjed Farid al-Qutob, London"}
{"text": "Updated, February 4, 2016.Members of the buzzing crowd at the Time Warner Center ate canaps and drank cocktails, craned their necks to get a look at Sting doing a red-carpet interview, and then filed into the screening room. Once they did, the party atmosphere quicklyturned somber.The film, an HBO documentary, is about the life and death of James Wright Foley, the American journalist who was kidnapped by ISIS in Syria, and later was executed, as shown in a horrific video seen around the world. Jim: The James Foley Story left the audience quiet and, in my case at least, in tears. Then things got still more emotional, as the journalists parents, John and Diane Foley, stood at a lectern and spoke briefly and with incredible grace about their son.I met them afterward and introduced myself to another of their sons, Michael Foley, with whom I had significant phone and email contact last year after he vehemently complained about some of The Timess coverage of his brothers time in prison. He objected, for example, to the description of his brother as an enthusiastic convert to Islam.I considered his complaints, and others I had heard about, in a Sunday column, and I tried to take on some of the broader, and very thorny, issues involved in covering Americans who have been kidnapped by terrorists. Times coveragebroke important ground when Rukmini Callimachi reported that American hostages often suffered because of their governments policy on opposing the payment of ransom.\n\nMany of the same issues arose in the documentary  again, leaving a great deal unanswered and unresolved. Directed by a childhoodfriend of Mr. Foleys, Brian Oakes, the documentary celebrates the journalists life and his character as a man for others. Relying heavily, and effectively, on family interviews and on those with former hostages imprisoned with Mr. Foley, it gives only a glancing treatment to the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Obama administration in failing to secure his release. And, for the most part, it skirts the larger geopolitical issues.This film leaves a lot of questions, the elder Mr. Foley said afterward. And that, his wife added, was done by design. The Foleys have established a foundation devoted to freeing American citizens imprisoned abroad.Despite the lingering questions, and its troubling subject matter, the film, which recently won a Sundance award, is certainly worth seeing; it debuts Saturdayon HBO.Separately, it is of the utmost importance that The Times continues to dig deep into ISIS coverage. The executive editor, Dean Baquet, recently told me that this is among his highest priorities for the newsroom in the year ahead. (Update:This has been illustrated by two piecespublished this week.)"}
{"text": "President Obama will make his first visit to a mosque in the United States on Wednesday, traveling to a suburb of Baltimore to meet with Muslim leaders and to speak out against hostility and discrimination against Islam.The visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore comes as anti-Muslim sentiment has surfaced in the Republican presidential primary campaign, notably with Donald J. Trumps proposal after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., to bar Muslims from entering the United States.I think the president is quite interested in making sure that were affirming the important role that Muslims play in our diverse American society and certainly affirming their right to worship God in a way thats consistent with their heritage, the White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. And they shouldnt be subject to ridicule or targeting by anybody, let along somebody who aspires to lead our country.Mr. Obama, who visited a mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, during a trip there in 2010, will conduct a round table with Muslim leaders before delivering what is certain to be a closely watched speech before a larger audience. He touched on his distress at anti-Muslim bigotry in his State of the Union address, saying: When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid called names, that doesnt make us safer. Thats not telling it like it is. Its just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.Mr. Obama is not the first American president to try to stem a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment. President George W. Bush visited a Washington mosque after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and made repeated calls for tolerance."}
{"text": "Ted Cruz beat all comers in Mondays Iowa caucuses. He also beat expectations. Yet according to political prediction markets, Marco Rubio was the nights biggest winner. Mr. Rubios third-place showing led his political stock to soar, and markets now rate him as a strong favorite to win the G.O.P. nomination.Indeed, it is signaling he is now more likely to win than not.In the hours after the Iowa caucus, bettors raised the chances of a nomination victory by Mr. Rubio to 54 percent from 33 percent. By contrast, Mr. Cruz remains a long shot; his chances to win the nomination rose from only 8 percent on the morning before the caucuses to 13 percent in the hours after the results became clear.The biggest loser was Donald Trump, whose second-place finish came as a disappointment after he led both the polls and markets leading up to the caucus. Markets have slashed his chances of winning the nomination to 25 percent from 51 percent. Of this 26-point decline, 21 percentage points went to Mr. Rubio, and only five to Mr. Cruz. To be sure, these early market reactions are based on relatively thin trading volume, and so the numbers may well bounce around a bit in coming days.Jeb Bush is the only other candidate given much of a chance, although he must be disappointed to have finished sixth, with less than 3 percent of the vote. Markets have downgraded his chances of recovering to 4 percent from 6 percent.Scoring early primaries is hard, as the question of who is winning is easily confounded with the question of who is beating expectations. Prediction markets answer each question separately. The candidate rated most likely to win can be judged to be winning the campaign. And because prediction markets measure expectations, they rise only when a candidate outperforms these expectations. So the sharp uptick in Mr. Rubios chances should be read as evidence that he handily beat expectations.One of the strengths of prediction markets is that they tend to be relatively measured in their response to new information, as they try to distinguish transitory shifts in public opinion from more lasting changes in the dynamics of a race. In the 2012 cycle, for instance, the markets remained largely unimpressed as Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum took turns in pushing ahead of Mitt Romney in national polls.Similarly, in late 2015, markets discounted the transitory polling booms enjoyed by Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. This same dynamic has meant that it has taken months for prediction market traders to be convinced that they should take Mr. Trumps impressive polling numbers seriously.By contrast, todays shift in the markets appears to be sharp and decisive, suggesting that they believe that the early rounds of voting reveal a lot about the underlying state of this election. And as sharp as todays shift against Mr. Trump has been, it pales in comparison with the crash in Howard Deans market odds after his poor showing in the 2004 Democratic Iowa caucus. That assessment turned out to be justified.While it is too early to count out Mr. Bush entirely, the G.O.P. contest is increasingly looking like a three-horse race. And perhaps that explains Mr. Rubios bounce. The dominant story line of this race has been one of outsiders versus the establishment, with outsiders like Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump helped by the fact that the establishment lane has looked overcrowded. That no longer seems to be the case; markets have not only written down Mr. Bushs odds, but theyve also largely written off the chances of Chris Christie and John Kasich.To put it all together, after the Iowa caucus, prediction markets tell us that the winner didnt win, that the runner-up was the biggest loser, and that the biggest surprise Monday night came when the expected third-place getter came in third. Its that sort of election season."}
{"text": "Bernie didnt fail us. We failed Bernie.Thats the message, perhaps unintentional, of the four-hour ABC mini-series Madoff (Wednesday and Thursday). Told from the point of view of Bernard L. Madoff, now serving a 150-year prison sentence for perpetrating Americas greatest Ponzi scheme, its a story of chutzpah, not hubris. Mr. Madoff was just a poor boy from Queens with a dream. Was it his fault that people are so easy to fool?Madoff, written by Ben Robbins and directed by Raymond De Felitta, doesnt ignore the tales tragic dimensions. But it doesnt emphasize them, either. The first two hours, as Mr. Madoff builds his illusory empire and at first evades detection, are largely played for comedy, even farce. The second half, when it all comes crashing down, favors movie-of-the-week melodrama and sentimentalism.And throughout, the voice we hear, narrating the action and inexorably drawing our sympathy, is that of Mr. Madoff. Or rather that of Richard Dreyfuss, who gives a polished, surprisingly jovial performance in an underwritten role. If the main job of a Madoff drama is to get inside the head of a man who could pull off such a brazen scheme for so long, Madoff doesnt find much there besides clichs about striving Jewish immigrants (who tend to make the best salesmen) and overbearing patriarchs.What the production lacks in moral dimension or psychological acuity it occasionally makes up for in entertainment value. The first night, especially, offers some snappy comedy as it delineates how Mr. Madoff and a few trusted employees carried out their titanic fraud under the noses of the rest of his firms employees, including his two sons.These scenes will be familiar to followers of the Madoff case from the testimony of his lieutenant Frank DiPascali Jr., played here as a benign financial wiseguy by Michael Rispoli. When investigators demand a nonexistent file, the fraudsters hurriedly assemble a fake version and then, to give it the proper filing-cabinet sheen, toss it around the room like a football and smash it into the walls.In one of the shows funniest scenes Mr. DiPascali demonstrates a computer system for a couple of hedge-fund executives, ostensibly showing them how Mr. Madoff is able to generate steady returns for his clients through any kind of market. When he types a request into the machine  which is just a shell  it goes to an employee at a desk two floors below, who sends back the desired response.The hedge-fund guys, who are recurring characters, are generally portrayed as greedy buffoons, which is representative of the shows approach. It wants to please the viewer by showing us the rich as grinning idiots, government regulators as dim apparatchiks and the whistle-blower Harry Markopolos (Frank Whaley), the closest thing the story has to a hero, as a sweaty, twitching numbers geek.Parallel to the tale of the scam is the story of its effect on the Madoff family, and as my colleague Joe Nocera has pointed out, much more time is spent on their problems than on the problems of Mr. Madoffs victims. Several good actors are sacrificed to this soap-opera material  Peter Scolari cant do much with Mr. Madoffs brother, Peter, who spends most of the show falling deeper into spiritual crisis, and neither can Blythe Danner with Mr. Madoffs wife, Ruth, though she has some nice moments in scenes with Danny Deferrari as the Madoffs son Andrew. Tom Lipinski of The Knick fares best as the other son, Mark, who represents all the outrage Mr. Madoff generated.Madoff is Mr. Dreyfusss show, though, and while the charismatic character he puts on screen, generous and loyal to a fault, may not jibe with our impression of the real Mr. Madoff, hes fun to watch. If Bernard L. Madoff said, Im simply an ordinary businessman who got in over his head, youd laugh. When Richard Dreyfuss says it, you laugh  and you half believe him."}

{"text": "Another day, another fevered round of fashion speculation. Rumors are popping up with the blinding frequency of paillettes on an Elie Saab dress. Ive never seen it this way. Its corrosive. So lets take them out of the shadows where they breed.The news on Monday that the mens wear brands Brioni and Berluti were both parting ways with their designers, a stunning one-day shake-up of the talent pool, immediately gave rise to rumors that Alessandro Sartori, Berlutis designer of five years, would be headed back to Ermenegildo Zegna, which is itself rumored to be about to lose its designer, Stefano Pilati, who, according to whispers in Paris, is being considered for the designer job at Lanvin, a post left vacant when Alber Elbaz was fired in October.Phew, got that?Mr. Sartori had been the much-acclaimed design director of the more fashion-forward Z Zegna line before heading to Berluti, and Mr. Pilati is the former creative director of Yves Saint Laurent, so the idea makes some sense. Especially because Mr. Pilati had joined Zegna in 2013 to oversee the companys womens brand, Agnona, as well as the Zegna couture mens wear, but he stepped down from his womens wear role in July and was thought to be looking at other opportunities in that area. Like  Lanvin?Who knows? Last week at the Paris couture shows, playing the front-row game of telephone, it was said that Haider Ackermann was being considered for the Lanvin job.All of it pales, however, in comparison to the talk surrounding the future of Hedi Slimane, the Saint Laurent creative director who will have a mega-blowout mens wear show on Feb. 10 in Los Angeles, after which, goes the chatter (which has been denied by YSL by the way, to no apparent avail), he may go to Christian Dior, to take the job Raf Simons left in October. Or to Chanel. Or to start his own house. Or, well, to do something else. He did it before, after all, when he left Dior Homme in 2007.Of course, he might not go to Christian Dior, theres some history there, not all of it good. Also, he is based in L.A., and its hard to imagine the petites mains of a Parisian couture atelier hopping on a plane with their sewing kits multiple times a year. So maybe Sarah Burton, the creative director of Alexander McQueen, will go to Dior  even though she is based in London, about to have her third child and is emotionally tied to the house her mentor built. Plus, McQueen has denied she is leaving.And Mr. Slimane might not go to Chanel, because maybe Ms. Burtons compatriot Phoebe Philo, the creative director of Cline, might take that job.And, of course, Chanels creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, despite being 80-something, does not appear to be going anywhere. He just produced one of the best couture shows of the week.So where is this all coming from? It is conjured from perceived dissatisfaction (Ms. Philo musing backstage after her last show, Ive been longing to be more and more in nature, to get away from the city and put my toes in the sand, though how a desire to go to the beach would make her want to lead an enormous, demanding, global brand is not entirely clear) and contract renegotiation tactics.It also comes from sightings of designers meeting with executives from other brands (exploratory meetings and conversations being normal business practice in pretty much any other industry, and not necessarily signaling any real intent, but rather mutual interest and curiosity) and, most significant it seems to me, the current sense of instability in the industry.There has been so much designer churn that we have been schooled to expect it, maybe even to want it  or at least the drama associated with it. And because some of the turnover has been truly surprising, it has created a situation where observers have begun to suspend disbelief about what they are hearing. And because after Mr. Simons left Dior under his own steam, and Mr. Elbaz was kicked out of Lanvin, anything is possible.As a result, a single complaint or observation can set off a wildfire of whispers. No matter what the companies actually say.Some of them may prove to be true. But if my years watching this business have taught me anything, its that a negotiation isnt over till the fat lady signs. Or the designer and house commit. I know of multiple designer/brand pairings that were 95 percent from being finalized, and fell apart at the last minute. Poof go the rumors, up in smoke.But meanwhile, all this talk is not good for anyone. It undermines the products themselves, because if a collection is a designers last, and a house will then be in flux as it develops a new creative identity, why should a consumer buy their clothes? Or a retailer commit their budget? Or a critic pay much attention? Especially if the designer hasnt been there long enough  three years, or even five  to establish a significant aesthetic, hence turning the last collection into a collectors item, a must-have relic of an important fashion time.It prevents brands handing the full creative reins  ad campaign, retail, brand extensions  over to a designer, because they need to keep consistency in something (even if the overall visual messaging then gets confused). And the investment required to switch from one vision to another is enormous, and can only really pay off over time.It creates deep insecurity on every side. It needs to stop."}

{"text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C.   The three-time Nascar champion Tony Stewart was hospitalized Tuesday with a back injury, and Stewart-Haas Racing said the team was unsure of the extent of his injuries injuries. Next week he is expected in Daytona Beach, Fla., to prepare for his final season in Sprint Cup.Stewart, 44, was injured Sunday in an accident while he was riding an all-terrain vehicle on the West Coast, said Mike Arning, a spokesman for Stewart-Haas Racing. Stewart was being evaluated at an undisclosed hospital and was able to move all his extremities.Arning indicated that Stewarts condition would not be updated again until Thursday. Stewart was in Arizona on Saturday night at the Barrett-Jackson car auction in Scottsdale and was interviewed on live television from the event.Stewart is retiring at the end of this Nascar season, and he was supposed to report next week to Daytona International Speedway to begin preparing for the Daytona 500, which takes place Feb. 21.We have received word from Stewart-Haas Racing of Tony Stewarts accident and injury, Nascar Chairman Brian France said in a statement. On behalf of everyone at Nascar, I wish Tony a full recovery and look forward to seeing him back in our sport when hes ready to return.Stewart, who turns 45 in May, missed a third of the 2013 season with a broken leg sustained in a sprint car accident. A year later, his car struck and killed a fellow driver, Kevin Ward Jr, at a dirt track in New York. Stewart was cleared of criminal wrongdoing but faces a civil suit filed by Wards family.Stewart spoke last month of his excitement over his final season and said he would probably return to racing in non-Nascar events upon his retirement. He has competed only in Sprint Cup races since Wards death in 2014.But Stewart also spoke of what he would like to accomplish in this final season, with a focus on winning his first Daytona 500, the sports crown jewel event. Stewart is 0-17 in the race and has come heartbreakingly close to winning it several times.

{"text": "Updated 8:57 a.m.Good morning on this soggy Wednesday.The Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City, Temple Row on Staten Island, Union Square Park in Manhattan; all are counted among New Yorks most cherished icons, but none are official city landmarks.At least not yet, though its not for a lack of effort.The gems have languished on a list of 95 sites (fastidiously catalogued here) to be evaluated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.More than 85 percent of the properties have been in a backlog for over 20 years, and some for five decades.But this month, their advocates patience might be rewarded.By Feb. 23, all nominees that have been waiting since before 2010 will face one of three fates: priority for landmark designation, rejection or reapplication limbo.Matt A. V. Chaban, who writes The Appraisal column for The Times, told us that the battle between developers and preservationists over the backlog has become a symbol of sorts, one that suits the citys long history of battles over landmarks.These buildings are basically pawns in the fight for the future of preservation in the city, he explained. Both sides care because its emblematic of where the commission may be going.One site on the list that could prove contentious is Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, the final resting ground of many New York luminaries.The politician William M. Tweed, who was known as Boss and is buried there, would surely delight in the sparring.As Mr. Chaban put it, I guess landmarking doesnt even end when life does.Heres what else is happening:WEATHERThings you can count on today: rain and unseasonably warm temperatures, with a high of 55 degrees.It may only be sprinkling when you leave home this morning, but it will definitely be pouring when you come home.Winter coat watch: Better yet, a raincoat.IN THE NEWS Some jurors in the trial of Peter Liang, the police officer charged with a fatal shooting in the stairwell of a public housing building, tested the trigger of the gun used in the shooting.

{"text": "Luciano Berios groundbreaking Sinfonia, which helped pave the way for the freewheeling compositional styles now in vogue, is too seldom heard. So Ludovic Morlots stirring rendition with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening was most welcome.If Sinfonia was not the greatest musical work of the 1960s (and it may well have been), it was certainly the masterpiece most of the 60s. To four movements completed and performed in 1968, Berio added a fifth, and the finished work had its premiere in 1969, with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic.It wallows in eclecticism, quoting Mahler  lots of it  and tunes by innumerable other composers. Its text speaks of alienation and bristles with frustration at war and social injustice. (They remind us all this cant stop the wars, cant make the old younger or lower the price of bread.) It honors the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.The Curtis Symphony, the orchestra of the elite Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, gave the brilliant instrumentation all it was worth on Monday. But Sinfonia is complex, layering eight amplified singing and speaking voices among a huge band, and those vocal lines, performed gamely by members of the Curtis Opera Theater but inadequately amplified, did not often make their mark.Berio said in a performance note that the different degrees of understanding, even the experience of not quite hearing, are to be regarded as essential to the nature of the musical process. But enough of the text (printed complete in the program) has to be heard to allow for appreciation of its quirky mode of expression, sometimes urgent, sometimes arch.One of the lines of text barely heard on Monday referred to Mahlers First Symphony, which made tulips grow in my garden and altered the flow of the ocean currents, so that symphony made an apt, equally ambitious partner to Sinfonia on the program. After an early misstep or two, the young players gave it a strong and coherent workout, responding eagerly to Mr. Morlots direction.As in the Berio, clangorous climaxes were well gauged and weighted. At the other extreme, the lovely Lindenbaum section of the third movement featured beautifully delicate playing from all concerned.Those two meaty offerings would have been enough, surely, but the program opened with Busonis modest Berceuse lgiaque as a showcase for a conducting student, Conner Gray Covington. He dispatched the assignment smoothly."}
{"text": "Sweats are a uniquely amplifying item of clothing. Nothing on earth makes an athletic person look more athletic, and nothing on earth makes a slovenly person look more slovenly. Sweats facilitate movement almost as well as they promote inactivity. They are not very useful for anything in between those poles, but they are ideal for both.This occurred to me when thinking about the word athleisure, which has popped up as marketing shorthand for a category of clothing that has been roughly defined as street-appropriate gymwear.The term itself is unfledged; if you type it into Google Trends, which tracks the popularity of search terms over time, it scarcely shows up until early 2014, with hockey stick growth igniting midway through 2015 and no signs of slowing as I type.Two stores have opened downtown in service of athleisure, both oriented toward women. One is a completists version of something weve seen before, and one is a near-perfect version of something we havent. Both offer luxuriant sweatpants.Technical apparel for recreation is how the brand Outdoor Voices describes its clothing. Founded in 2013 by a now 27-year-old woman named Tyler Haney, the brand has a store in Austin, Tex., and a new pop-up shop in SoHo.Everything about Outdoor Voices strikes a balance between cheekiness and assiduity, right down to its name  a nice corrective to the term indoor voices, which is how teachers have historically reprimanded children who dont know how to govern the VOLUME of their SPEECH.We believe that fitness doesnt have to be defined by performance, reads an introduction on the companys website, and we celebrate approaching activity with moderation, humor, and delight.Delight is everywhere at Outdoor Voices, from the stores merrily implausible soundtrack (the Shangri-Las and the Ronettes) to the Frank Stella palette of its colorblocked workout leggings ($95) to its adorable merchandising, with zines and sneakers sitting atop foam geometric shapes and tables with speckled surfaces in Ettore Sottsass colors.I palpated a slinky hoodie in ultramarine ($85) while a saleswoman straightened the racks nearby. Holy smokes, this is soft, I said, addressing her. What is this made out of?The label says its a poly and spandex blend, but I dont believe that, she replied. I believe its made from clouds and magic.Me too.I tried on a boxy tee ($65) and a crop top ($60), each in a space-dyed black-and-white pattern that I would describe as digital Oreo (yum). They were almost too pretty to ruin with sweaty emissions. I bought both.The prices at Outdoor Voices are a little mighty for athletic gear, but each piece is designed with a rigor that justifies the outlay: Labels are printed right onto the fabrics interior, so there are no itchy tags to snip out, and most fabrics are mildly textured  heathered, marled  to mask perspiration. This is what tech intelligence plus good design looks like. I can hear the imitators firing up their laptops.But Outdoor Voices has nothing to fear; it has found its audience. Ive never seen so many beautiful, exquisitely composed women in one space. I am hesitant to publicize this fact because Im worried that the store will attract a gawking element but  oh, well. Its too conspicuous not to point out.After 20 minutes browsing, I felt the way I do after two hours at the Met: entertained, exhilarated and ready for a brownie.Kith Women, meantime, has more-modest ambitions. The tiny storefront on Bleecker came to fruition after the founder of its brother brand, Kith, noticed women snatching up the smaller sizes of his mens wear line. The new store presents a designed-for-women line of activewear by Kith mixed in with pieces from Nike and Adidas by Stella McCartney.For such a small space (it has the dimensions of a taco stand), Kith Women offers a huge amount of stuff while still feeling minimalist. This feat is accomplished by way of crafty design decisions: A window seat doubles as a shoe try-on station; a dressing room is hidden James Bond-style behind a wall; there are white marble floors and white fluorescent accents and mirrors on both walls to reflect all that whiteness. The snow outside is dirty, but the mirrors at Kith Women are Windexed.The clothing is unassuming, with an upscale business hotel color palette: black, navy, pearl, oyster, heathered laurel and a billion shades of gray.Its a conservative range of hues borrowed from mens wear and girlified with smart little tweaks: A paneled workout top by Kith ($145) has a scoop neck where you might expect a crew neck; a sports bra from Adidas by Stella McCartney ($70) comes in foggy mauve; an Adidas Superstar shoe ($150) features a cap toe in glinting rose gold.There are at least 120 styles of shoe on display and a range of lifestyle accessories, like Sachajuan shampoo ($26), vintage Polaroid cameras ($130) and RGB nail polish in tasteful neutrals ($18).The air is mildly scented by house-branded candles with names like Den, Lounge, Study, Loft, Studio and Foyer ($40 each). After making sure that the word loft did not appear on the actual candle, I bought Loft, which features notes of quince, blood orange, mango, frangipani, Tuscan iris powder, milk, artemisia and teakwood.You had me at Tuscan iris powder, candle."}
{"text": "Scientists have mapped the genome of bedbugs in New York City and traced fragments of the pests DNA through the subway system.In the grubby recesses of hundreds of stations, they have discovered surprising genetic diversity among the creatures.Scientists have found that genetic traces of bedbugs in northern Manhattan are relatively closely related to those in the islands southern part, while there are bigger variations between bedbugs on the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side.Christopher Mason, a geneticist who worked on the project, said the reason could be found by looking at a subway map. In Manhattan, for instance, subway lines run the length of the island north to south, while there is no subway link through Central Park connecting the East Side and the West Side.Not that bedbugs are riding the subway, said George Amato, an evolutionary biologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who also worked on bedbug project. He said New Yorks bedbugs move around with people, dogs and peoples items  and they probably move most easily the way people move most easily.Dr. Amato collaborated with Dr. Mason, who works at the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medical College.A bedbug colony at the natural history museum was used for the genome map. A similar map was assembled by an international research team at 36 institutions, including the University of Cincinnati.The New York teams resulting scientific paper on the subject was published on Tuesday in Nature Communications. A second paper on bedbug genetics, from the University of Cincinnati, also was published on Tuesday in the same publication.To learn how the bedbug has evolved and spread, the New York team took DNA sample swabs from 1,400 city locations, including subway cars, turnstiles, ticket vending kiosks and aboveground places such as parks.Dr. Amato said there were many ways small fragments of the insects DNA, or the DNA of a related species, could get into the subway  clinging to the clothes of some of the six million daily riders and their belongings, or being washed down into the stations.He said that the first rough bedbug genetic sequence emerged about a year ago, but that it took months to refine the model into an accurate genome.Before this, people were just feeling their way through in the dark; this genome turns the light on for various areas of other research, Dr. Amato said. Our team is now moving on to the genetics of cockroaches and other living fossils."}
{"text": "Theranos is in trouble, and David Boies, a star lawyer, has placed himself at the heart of it, a decision that he may come to rue.Theranos, a blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes when she was 19, is fighting for its survival. After reports in The Wall Street Journal raised questions about the companys technology, Theranos has been in a tailspin.The companys methodology and science are in doubt, a federal regulator found that one lab had violated several clinical standards and the drugstore chain Walgreens has suspended tests at a Theranos lab in California.Theranos is fighting back, claiming that its technology is valid and asserting that the facts will prevail as its technology is scientifically tested.At the center of the companys defense is Mr. Boies, a founder and the chairman of Boies Schiller & Flexner.Mr. Boies is known as one of the smartest and shrewdest litigators in the country. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 presidential dispute, he litigated the Microsoft antitrust case for the federal government, and he is representing Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, in his suit against the government.In the wake of the questions being asked about Theranos, the company hired Mr. Boies. He had represented Theranos before and his firms ties with the company ran deep. The general counsel of Theranos is a former Boies Schiller partner.That Mr. Boies is representing an embattled client is nothing new. But this time, the lawyer has raised the ante by becoming a director of Theranos.Lets stop here and note that this has the potential to blow up. Mr. Boies is taking on two different roles at Theranos. A lawyer represents a client  here Theranos  while a director, even at a privately held company like Theranos, represents the companys investors.Depending on what unfolds at Theranos, Mr. Boies may be put in a position where he either has to protect the company (as its lawyer) or the shareholders (as a director).I asked one of my colleagues, Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in business ethics, about this potential conflict. She was skeptical of Mr. Boiess dual role.I have a hard time believing that an experienced litigator can adequately represent investors  one of the primary responsibilities of a director  while being attentive to potential legal strategies, which might cause him to privilege the interests of management, she told me. It just seems a difficult line to walk.No doubt Theranos waived the conflict in lots of documented forms. And the American Bar Association does allow this type of dual role. But just because a conflict is allowed doesnt mean it will not lead to problems.If the technology of Theranos turns out to be not what it claims, investors would almost certainly seek to sue the chief executive, Ms. Holmes, and the company, as well as the board that allowed this to happen.This gets complicated for Mr. Boies, because Theranos is a corporate governance disaster.Ms. Holmes controls the company, and she solidified that control in 2013 by arranging for the company to adopt a high-vote stock structure that gave her most of the votes. This is a problem because the company is essentially Ms. Holmes, although it has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from outside investors. She founded it, had the idea and has led the technology. If the technology is shown to be flawed, she may not be quick to admit that to the benefit of the remaining shareholders.Mr. Boies, of course, is no expert in blood testing technology. But in evaluating the firms technology, he will get little to no help from his fellow board members. Before the first Journal article appeared, the board of Theranos had no outside scientific experience. It consisted mainly of statesmen, including two former senators and even Henry Kissinger. Most of these board members have now been demoted to advisers.The Theranos board is now five people, including Ms. Holmes and the companys chief operating officer. None of the rest have scientific experience. Two other directors are a retired Marine Corps general and the chief executive of Bechtel, the construction company. Then there is Mr. Boies.This is, frankly, a weak board and another potential land mine for Mr. Boies, as the weakness of the board does not lessen the fiduciary duty he has to all Theranos shareholders.The potential for conflict is particularly great. What if Ms. Holmes resists changes that would be in the interest of shareholders? What if the board decides that it is time for her to go  and she stands her ground?The board could do little more than throw up its collective hands under the current governance structure.Mr. Boies, and the other outside directors, could resign in protest. But why would anyone, particularly Mr. Boies, be a director on a board that lacked the power to make fundamental changes?Indeed, what is Mr. Boies thinking? He may be paid lots of money for his roles, but for someone so successful and savvy to put himself in a position that is bound to be problematic is puzzling.A request for comment to Boies Schiller was referred to a representative who declined to comment. Theranos did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.There is also a lesson for those venture capitalists who invested in Theranos.The recent bubbly years when unicorns  start-up companies valued at $1 billion or more  seemed to emerge almost daily led venture capitalists to agree to governance structures that placed all power with the founder. After all, this is a structure that worked for Facebook.But Theranos is no Facebook. That Theranos had no real board in place and took repeated steps to place all power with Ms. Holmes may not have been a problem when Theranos was a start-up darling. But now, Theranos has fallen and will have to prove itself. Governance matters most in crisis times, and Theranos lacks it, to the chagrin of its investors. Even Mark Zuckerberg put together a real board and hired Sheryl Sandberg as a check.One has to wish Mr. Boies luck. If Theranos turns wildly successful, then there will be no problem. But if its troubles continue, he will have to do something he is less experienced at  be a director and corporate leader. The question will be whether the litigator in him will prevent that."}
{"text": "Ben Carson does not appreciate the dirty tricks that Senator Ted Cruzs campaign employed before the Iowa caucuses, and he challenged Mr. Cruz on Wednesday to do something about it.During a news conference in which he invoked the Bible, Mr. Carson said that voters  particularly the religious ones that Mr. Cruz has been appealing to  should pay close attention to the actions of the Texas senators campaign. As Iowans were heading to the caucuses on Monday, members of Mr. Cruzs team spread rumors that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was dropping out of the race and encouraged his supporters to back Mr. Cruz.Mr. Carson was, in fact, planning to go home to Florida the next day and pick up some clean clothes. Mr. Cruz called him to apologize and said that what his staff members did was unacceptable.But on Wednesday Mr. Carson, who came in fourth place in Iowa, said that Mr. Cruzs apology was not enough.Its clear that there were people who tried to take advantage of a situation and tried to distort information, Mr. Carson said.He went on to quote a passage from the Bible that says, By their fruit you will know them, and suggested that the situation revealed something about Mr. Cruzs character.Let me put it this way, when I discovered that there were things in my campaign that I couldnt agree with after making an investigation, I made changes, Mr. Carson said. Thats what a good leader does. If he agrees with it, he doesnt need to make changes.Donald J. Trump, who finished second in Iowa, has also seized on the issue and accused Mr. Cruzs campaign of fraud. He said the outcome of the caucuses should be nullified.The crowd of journalists who turned out for Mr. Carsons hastily scheduled news conference at the National Press Club in Washington seemed to be as interested in his own campaign missteps  and how they could have enabled the Cruz campaign.While several presidential candidates have dropped out this week, Mr. Carson said he was still seeing enthusiasm about his candidacyand that he did not plan to step aside.In a baseball game, there are nine innings, Mr. Carson said. You dont call the game after an inning or two."}
{"text": "A lot of the debate over the Sanders insurgency hinges on whether you see Obama-era reforms as trivial, utterly inadequate to the problems, or as a half loaf thats a lot better than none. (It also hinges on whether you believe that a Sanders candidacy could mobilize vast untapped wells of progressive sentiment, or whether you believe that he would be hit with a smear campaign like nothing youve seen before  except for what has already happened to Hillary Clinton, and is baked into her polling. You can guess what I think.)On healthcare, people like me and most of the health wonks I know believe that Obamacare represents a huge step forward, while the Sanders wing tends to dismiss it as nothing much. Ive been making the case that Obama energy policy is going to have a much bigger impact on climate change than many people think. But what about financial reform?Well, it partly depends on what you consider the problem. Ive been on record since early days saying that too-big-to-fail is not the key issue, so that the fact that big banks remain big is, um, no big deal. The real question  or so Id argue  is leverage within the financial sector, and in particular the kind of leverage with no safety net that characterizes shadow banking.So Matt OBrien weighs in with evidence that leverage has in fact declined substantially, and continued to decline even as the economy expanded  probably because of Dodd-Frank. This is certainly right; the same decline shows up in other measures, as in the chart above showing financial sector debt securities as a percentage of GDP.Should we have had a stiffer financial reform? Definitely  required capital ratios should be a lot higher than they are. But Dodd-Franks rules  especially, I think, the prospect of being classed as a SIFI, a strategically important institution subject to tighter constraints, have had a real effect in reducing risk.The reality of the Obama era, for progressives, is a series of half loaves. But after all the defeats over the previous 30 years, arent those achievements something to celebrate?"}
{"text": "Over the last few years weve been treated to a number of Facebook revolutions, from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to the squares of Istanbul, Kiev and Hong Kong, all fueled by social media. But once the smoke cleared, most of these revolutions failed to build any sustainable new political order, in part because as so many voices got amplified, consensus-building became impossible.Question: Does it turn out that social media is better at breaking things than at making things?Recently, an important voice answered this question with a big  yes. That voice was Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee whose anonymous Facebook page helped to launch the Tahrir Square revolution in early 2011 that toppled President Hosni Mubarak  but then failed to give birth to a true democratic alternative.In December, Ghonim, who has since moved to Silicon Valley, posted a TED talk about what went wrong. It is worth watching and begins like this: I once said, If you want to liberate a society, all you need is the Internet. I was wrong. I said those words back in 2011, when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The Arab Spring revealed social medias greatest potential, but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart.In the early 2000s, Arabs were flocking to the web, Ghonim explained: Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities, for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe, we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual, alternative life.And then in June 2010, he noted, the Internet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook, I saw a photo  of a tortured, dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture.  I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it We Are All Khaled Said. In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.Soon Ghonim and his friends used Facebook to crowd-source ideas, and the page became the most followed page in the Arab world.  Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it.Ghonim was eventually tracked down in Cairo by Egyptian security services, beaten and then held incommunicado for 11 days. But three days after he was freed, the millions of protesters his Facebook posts helped to galvanize brought down Mubaraks regime.Alas, the euphoria soon faded, said Ghonim, because we failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization. Social media, he noted, only amplified the polarization by facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.Supporters of the army and the Islamists used social media to smear each other, while the democratic center, which Ghonim and so many others occupied, was marginalized. Their revolution was stolen by the Muslim Brotherhood and, when it failed, by the army, which then arrested many of the secular youths who first powered the revolution. The army has its own Facebook page to defend itself.It was a moment of defeat, said Ghonim. I stayed silent for more than two years, and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened.Here is what he concluded about social media today: First, we dont know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm peoples biases are now believed and spread among millions of people. Second, We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else. Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs.  Its as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars.And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet.Fifth, and most crucial, he said, today, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations.  Its as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.Ghonim has not given up. He and a few friends recently started a website, Parlio.com, to host intelligent, civil conversations about controversial and often heated issues, with the aim of narrowing gaps, not widening them. (I participated in a debate on Parlio and found it engaging and substantive.)Five years ago, concluded Ghonim, I said, If you want to liberate society, all you need is the Internet. Today I believe if we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet."}
{"text": "Last September, Dallas-area drivers for UberBlack, the companys high-end car service, received an email informing them that they would be expected to start picking up passengers on UberX, its low-cost option.The next day, when the policy was scheduled to go into effect, dozens of drivers caravaned to Ubers office in downtown Dallas and planted themselves outside until company officials met with them. Many had taken out loans to buy luxury vehicles that cost upward of $35,000, and worried that the modest per-mile rate for UberX passengers would barely cover gas and wear and tear, to say nothing of their car payments.The standoff stretched across nearly three more tense days until Uber allowed them to opt out of the policy. They thought we were just going to give up, walk away, said Kirubel Kebede, a leader of the group. But we said, No, this is our livelihood.In the rapid growth of the online gig economy, many workers have felt squeezed and at times dehumanized by a business structure that promises independence but often leaves them at the mercy of increasingly powerful companies. Some are beginning to band together in search of leverage and to secure what they see as fairer treatment from the platforms that make the work possible.We started realizing were not contractors, were more like employees, said Berhane Alemayoh, one of the UberBlack drivers in Dallas. They tell us what kind of car to drive. They kick you out if a customer accused you of not having a clean car. They started to tighten the rope. Gradually, we cant breathe any more.Perhaps the most prominent effort was a measure to give ride-hailing drivers the right to unionize in Seattle, which was approved by the City Council in December.But while many campaigns by alienated workers have shunned this more traditional labor-organizing approach, they have highlighted a basis for advancing the interests of gig economy workers collectively.Theres a sense of workplace identity and group consciousness despite the insistence from many of these platforms that they are simply open marketplaces or malls for digital labor, said Mary L. Gray, a researcher at Microsoft Research and professor in the Media School at Indiana University who studies gig economy workers.The efforts extend well beyond drivers for Uber and its prime competitor, Lyft. A group of couriers who find work on the platform Postmates is waging a campaign to create an Im done after this delivery button because they worry that turning down jobs will affect how many future assignments they receive. (A Postmates official said turning down jobs had no effect on future work, but that the company was still sympathetic to the idea.)The National Domestic Workers Alliance, which organizes nannies and housekeepers, recently produced what it calls the Good Work Code, which it has urged gig economy companies to adopt.They would be dispatched to a home that didnt feel safe, but would be hesitant to exit themselves from that situation because it might affect their ratings, said Palak Shah, the alliance official leading the effort, citing one of several issues that the Good Work Code is intended to address. A handful of firms, like Managed by Q, LeadGenius and CareLinx, have embraced the guidelines.Similarly, a group of workers on Amazons Mechanical Turk platform, where people post and accept piecework assignments, in 2014 developed extensive guidelines  including recommended pay and the need to provide timely responses to questions  for academics who use the platform for research purposes. More than 60 academics have signed on to date.Though the so-called Turkers tend to value the flexibility and independence of freelancing and often reject the idea of a traditional union, many have also developed a kind of working-stiff identity. Ive heard them say Jeff Bezos is their boss  were workers here, said Niloufar Salehi, a Stanford Ph.D. student who spent a year immersed in Turker forums to help the workers organize.By contrast, sellers of goods on digital marketplaces like eBay and Etsy rarely think of themselves as employees. In their minds, they say, they are independent artisans and shopkeepers.Etsy is the place where the shop exists, where I pay rent, said Sandie Russo, a longtime seller of hand-knit accessories and knitting patterns who once ran an online forum in which sellers helped one another address common problems. Its definitely that youre an entrepreneur, not a worker.Like the Etsy shopkeepers, many Uber drivers began their relationship with the company thinking of themselves as self-employed.There is that sense initially, said Harry Campbell, a longtime Uber driver who runs a popular blog and podcast about ride-hailing. But as time goes on, it wears off. You start to see that Uber does control a lot of aspects of the work.Unlike sellers on eBay or Etsy, Uber drivers cannot set the prices they charge. They are also constrained by the all-important rating system  maintain an average of around 4.6 out of 5 stars from customers in many cities or risk being deactivated  to behave a certain way, like not marketing other businesses to passengers.The experience of the Dallas UberBlack drivers is telling. When Uber entered Dallas in 2012, many of the drivers were either independent hired-car operators or contractors for limousine companies who bought or leased their own cars.Some had their own business, they were fine with the business, Mr. Alemayoh said. They just used Uber as a complement.The drivers formed a tactical alliance with the company to help it gain the citys approval, which local cab operators resisted. Mr. Alemayoh even sang Ubers praises in testimony before the Houston City Council, after the company asked him to speak there as part of its expansion efforts. I said its fair to drivers to have Uber, he recalled. I spoke on their behalf, they didnt pay me.But the relationship began to sour in 2014, when the company decreed that drivers with cars made before 2008 would no longer be able to participate in UberBlack.We said, You guys are affecting so many families, said Mr. Kebede, a leader of a group called the Association of Limousine Owners and Operators of Dallas Fort Worth, formed the previous year. Uber extended the grace period by several months in some cases but did not reverse the policy.By the time Uber handed down its UberX directive in September, the drivers had long since recognized that they were at the companys beck and call. Because of Ubers popularity, almost all their other sources of business had dried up. And Uber had earned the imprimatur of the City Council, which made the drivers politically expendable, too.So it was something of a surprise that the drivers association, which represents about 500 of the 2,000 to 3,000 black-car drivers it believes are active in the Dallas area, was able to push Uber not only to scale back the UberX change, but also to reinstate several of the drivers it had deactivated for pressuring fellow drivers as the showdown escalated.Some continue to be deactivated for what they feel are arbitrary reasons, which Uber maintains are unrelated to the protest (Drivers have the right to free expression and we respect that, said a company representative). But to the extent that the Dallas drivers have been successful, one crucial advantage is that they were able to organize in person rather than depend exclusively on the Internet and social media.That also helps explain the success of the campaign in Seattle, where Uber had previously reversed a rate cut after facing pressure from drivers. (Uber maintains that the reversal was unrelated.) The drivers have gone out and talked to each other, said Dawn Gearhart, a spokeswoman in the area for the Teamsters union, which provides support services to local drivers. Every time they would call a meeting, a couple hundred people would show up.Since the beginning of the year, drivers in cities like New York and San Francisco have relied on a similar local focus to organize protests over rate cuts. Hundreds of drivers descended on Ubers headquarters in Queens on Monday to demand that the old rates be restored.In the Tampa area, drivers have protested cuts that brought rates down to 65 cents a mile from 95 cents as of early January, and from $1.20 as recently as last spring. Net earnings for drivers there can come perilously close to subminimum wage rates on a 15- to 20-minute trip in town once they factor in pickup and wait times and the cost of gas, depreciation and maintenance.We sometimes lower prices in a city to get more people using Uber, said an Uber representative. As we have always said, price cuts need to work for drivers. If they do not, we will roll them back.In response, the Tampa area drivers started a weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers. During that time, they write messages on their windows about what they consider unlivable wages. The group has grown rapidly to a network of 700 drivers who communicate via an app-based walkie-talkie service called Zello.The Tampa drivers goal is to enlist Ubers most politically valuable asset  legions of customers who have grown dependent on the service  to help send a message to Uber. Over time, they hope to extend the logouts to several hours, perhaps even a full day on the weekend.Its a little blip on Ubers radar, said Josh Streeter, one of the leaders. But then people might believe they have the power. That if they band together, they could pull off a bigger action."}
{"text": "NEWARK   Less than two minutes before he scored the game-winning goal Tuesday, defenseman David Schlemko coughed up the puck with the Devils on a power play, leading to a juicy short-handed breakaway chance for Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh.McDonaghs shot zipped wide, and Schlemko, much like his team, made the most of a second chance, collecting a puck and, before the Rangers could cover him, flinging it past goaltender Henrik Lundqvist to give the Devils a thrilling 3-2 victory at Prudential Center.Weve got to win these games now, Schlemko said.Goaltender Cory Schneider made 31 saves  six after Schlemko scored at 11 minutes 14 seconds of the third period  to help the Devils (26-20-5) protect their first lead of the game and move to 2 points behind the Rangers (27-18-5) in the Metropolitan Division.The victory was the fifth in six games for the Devils, who were widely expected to finish at the bottom of the division but have played aggressively and with passion under their first-year coach, John Hynes.Were the type of team where we cant have guys coast and play, said Hynes, whose team has started making a realistic push for a playoff spot.The Rangers, who had won four of six games before the All-Star break, took 1-0 and 2-1 leads, but the Devils, before a sellout crowd of 16,514 that included plenty of Rangers fans in blue, came back to beat their rivals for the second time in two games this season.The Devils first goal was scored by Lee Stempniak, the veteran forward who played for the Rangers last season. He tied the score at 1-1 at 1:34 of the second period by flicking the rebound of a power-play shot by Eric Gelinas past Lundqvist.Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault challenged the call, saying Stempniak had interfered with Lundqvist. After a replay, Stempniaks 15th goal of the season stood. Stempniak scored the game-winning goal in overtime in the first game between the two teams this season Oct. 18.The Devils goal song was played immediately after Stempniak rose to the ice after he was slammed down by Rangers defenseman Kevin Klein, and again after Stempniak was officially awarded the goal at 1:34. The Devils fans then taunted Lundqvist.As long as he keeps scoring, I dont care who its against, Schneider said of Stempniak, who has 15 goals this season.For his part, Stempniak seemed to think it was appropriate that a player like Schlemko scored the game-winner. Schlemko, 28, played for three teams last season before signing a one-year, $625,000 contract in September with the Devils.Schlemko was on the ice for both of the Rangers goals, which were scored by J. T. Miller  the first as the lone defender back on a two-on-one break, which ended with Derick Brassard rapping a pass to Miller that he chipped past Schneider at 13:31 of the first period. But Schlemko was also on for the last goal of the game.Guys are working hard, guys are getting a little more opportunity, and guys are seizing the opportunity, Stempniak said.Miller scored his second goal of the game, and his sixth in his last five games, with a sharp-angle shot from the right face-off circle that darted under Schneiders glove at 2:06 of the third period, putting the Rangers up by one goal again.But the lead lasted only 67 seconds. The Devils Joseph Blandisi, a forward playing in only his 12th N.H.L. game, took a pass from defenseman Andy Greene and steamed around defenseman Dan Girardi before beating Lundqvist for his second goal of the season.I kind of had the same angle in the first period, but I passed it off, said Blandisi, who scored a goal Jan. 21 against Ottawa in the Devils previous home game.Before the game Hynes stressed to his players that their special teams needed to be better. The Devils were 2 for 2 on their power play; the Rangers went 0 for 4. The Devils had allowed seven power-play goals in seven games before the break.Now the Devils have 31 games to play, and they said they would not get too excited about making the playoffs after missing them in four of the last five years. They are still a short-handed team; on Tuesday they played without the veteran Mike Cammalleri, who has an injured hand.One game into the unofficial second half of the season, they still have a lot of resolve."}
{"text": "DES MOINES  Late Monday night, supporters of Hillary Clinton gathered for what they expected would be a victory rally.Over the weekend, her campaign had exuded confidence, with some advisers predicting she would win the Iowa caucuses by several percentage points, and by Monday evening, they were urging news outlets to call the race in her favor. Mrs. Clinton prepared a victory speech in which she virtually ignored her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and attacked the Republican candidates.Then the caucus results started rolling in. And everything changed.The outcome in Iowa  which at least until Tuesday afternoon appeared to be effectively a tie with a far left senator from a small New England state  dealt a jolting psychological blow to the Clinton campaign, leaving volunteers, donors and aides confused throughout the night, and then crestfallen. They had hoped that the former secretary of state would garner a decisive victory here and put to rest any doubts about her strength as a candidate.Instead, they now head to New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders is heavily favored in the polls, and brace themselves for another battle before they reach more hospitable states like Nevada and South Carolina.Even before Mrs. Clinton finished her brief remarks to her supporters late Monday night, discussions were underway among her outside advisers and donors about the need to bring in longtime Clinton aides and diminish the role of Robby Mook, her young data-driven campaign manager. Asked about such discussions, Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the campaign, grew irritated. Are you serious? he said tersely to a reporter.On board the campaigns plane to New Hampshire, Brian Fallon, another spokesman, declared a victory for Mrs. Clinton. We believe strongly that we won tonight, Mr. Fallon said. Senator Sanders has been saying for weeks that if this caucus was a high turnout affair, he would win. He was wrong.The Iowa Democratic Party declared early Tuesday morning that Mrs. Clinton had won. On Tuesday afternoon, The Associated Press also declared Mrs. Clinton the winner.The question the Clinton campaign confronts is whether the first two states are simply demographically unfriendly to Mrs. Clinton, as many analysts believe, or whether her lack of connection so far in Iowa and New Hampshire indicates a deeper shakiness underlying her candidacy.Former President Clinton had been among those who have attributed his wifes poor performance more to her campaigns muddled strategy and lack of a clear message than to Mrs. Clintons own failings.But strategic weaknesses can explain only so much. This election cycle has shown a hankering for anti-establishment candidates and a wariness toward political dynasties, whether their surnames are Clinton or Bush.Youre talking about someone who wants to move back into the White House, which is sort of a fundamentally anti-American notion, said Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romneys chief strategist in 2012.Whats more, Mr. Sanders showed strength in unexpected ways that could signal trouble for Mrs. Clinton, performing surprisingly well in rural counties and small caucus precincts, and even making some gains among Hispanic Democrats, his advisers said on Tuesday morning.Mr. Sanders won several counties that Mrs. Clinton carried in 2008 in conservative-leaning southwestern Iowa and in the northern part of the state, including Cerro Gordo County, where Mr. Sanders drew three times as many people as Mr. Clinton as the two men held dueling rallies last Wednesday night.Many of Mrs. Clintons friends and former advisers from Arkansas and the White House planned to meet her in New Hampshire to provide moral support and energy to her campaign team. Her backers said the results in Iowa should not be given too much weight.I know the early four states love being the early four states, and every four years you hear more and more about them, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton. But 60 percent of the delegates actually get decided in March.Other Democratic analysts wondered, however, if there were other weaknesses that need to be addressed.Yes, they have a firewall, but how much asbestos is really in that firewall? asked Robert Shrum, a strategist for Democratic presidential candidates, including Al Gore, Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry. Do people start to take a second look?Mrs. Clinton re-entered politics last spring after four years as secretary of state, noticeably rusty after her time away from the trail. Although she improved as a retail politician over 10 months of campaigning, in the end, to many voters, she could appear detached, too shrouded in layers of staff and security.On her trip to the Iowa State Fair in August, Mrs. Clintons staff and security team had mapped out a route so she could admire the prizewinning stalks of corn, see an exhibit on agriculture and pick up a pork-chop-on-a-stick before climbing into a black S.U.V. to catch a private flight to Marthas Vineyard.Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, has said that if Mrs. Clinton confronted a glass ceiling in her last presidential campaign, she now appears behind a glass curtain. Voters feel they can see and hear her, but they do not think they can relate to or touch her, Mr. Hart wrote in a Wall Street Journal column. In their words, she is remote and distant.At times, Mrs. Clinton seemed to fall back on wonkish Washington speak, using terms like COLA (or the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security) and income contingent repayment plans for sliding scale student loans. On occasion, she has instructed voters to visit her website to read about her plans to overhaul the criminal justice system.And she still faces an authenticity problem, even among Democrats. Some 47 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said that they felt Mrs. Clinton said what voters wanted to hear, rather than what she believed. Sixty-two percent said they believed Mr. Sanders said what he thought, according to a New York Times-CBS poll released Nov. 12.She has good points, but she just seems like a stereotypical politician, said Mark Anthony, 23, a graduate student in Ames, Iowa, who said he planned to support Mr. Sanders at the caucus."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   A 13-year-old Virginia girl was most likely stabbed to death by a Virginia Tech student on the day she disappeared, the authorities in Blacksburg, Va., said Tuesday, and a second university student  originally accused of helping dispose of the body  now faces charges of helping commit the murder.The girl, Nicole Madison Lovell  a liver-transplant and cancer survivor  disappeared last week from her home in Blacksburg, setting off an intense search as well as outrage over the role social media might have played in the case.Mary Pettitt, the commonwealths attorney for Montgomery County, Va., announced the very preliminary cause of death  based on the early results of an autopsy  and the additional charges at a brief news conference. Nicoles mother, Tammy Weeks, broke down in tears at the conference while speaking of her daughter, who had grappled with serious illness since she was born and needed daily medication to survive.Nicole, called Coley by her family, received a liver transplant when she was 10 months old to treat a rare tumor in her liver, her mother said. Then, at 4, she received a diagnosis of and was treated for non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a type of cancer. She had acute respiratory illness and slipped into a coma for six months, and then developed a potentially deadly bacterial infection.We were advised at this time that she had only a 1 percent chance of survival, Ms. Weeks said, adding, Coley once again beat the odds.David Eisenhauer, 18, a high school track star and aspiring engineer from Columbia, Md., is charged with abducting and killing Nicole. Ms. Pettitt offered few details of the investigation, but said the authorities now believed that the murder took place last Wednesday, the day Nicole disappeared  not on Saturday, as they had previously thought.The second student, Natalie Marie Keepers, 19, is also an aspiring engineer, from Laurel, Md., who had been charged with being an accessory to murder after the fact. She is now charged with being an accessory before the fact to first-degree murder, a charge that carries 20 years to life in prison, Ms. Pettitt said. Ms. Keepers remains charged with concealing a dead body, a felony with a maximum sentence of 10 years, and with being an accessory to murder after the fact, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum 12-month jail term.The chief of the Blacksburg Police Department, Anthony Wilson, said his officers were pursuing more than 400 leads in the investigation. A preliminary hearing for Mr. Eisenhauer and Ms. Keepers, who are being held without bond, is scheduled for March 28. Ms. Pettitt said the full results of Nicoles autopsy would most likely be ready shortly before the hearing.Nicole, described by friends and neighbors as a sweet girl who had been bullied at school and on social media, had apparently met Mr. Eisenhauer online. The police have not specified how they met, but in an interview on Monday, a child who lived nearby said that the day before she disappeared, Nicole showed her messages she had exchanged with an unidentified 18-year-old on Kik, a messaging app. The authorities did not take questions at the news conference; nor did Ms. Weeks.Coley had a passion for pandas, music, dancing, dreamed of being on American Idol someday, her favorite color was blue, her mother said, clutching a stuffed panda and reading from a statement. Nicole was a very lovable person. Nicole touched so many people throughout her short life.Ms. Weeks then broke down, saying, I cant do that part. Nicoles youth pastor, Josh Blankenship, finished, reading a verse often used at funerals: Our hearts still ache in sadness/And secret tears still flow/What it meant to lose you/No one will ever know."}
{"text": "NEWARK (AP)  The criminal charges in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing case should be thrown out because they are based on vague federal laws that have been twisted to fit the facts of the case, two former allies of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey wrote in separate court filings this week.Lawyers for the two former allies, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, challenged the governments case in the filings. Ms. Kellys lawyer wrote that the case was an indictment in search of a crime; Mr. Baronis lawyer accused the government of using tortured legal theory.Ms. Kelly, who was the governors deputy chief of staff at the time of the lane closings in September 2013, and Mr. Baroni, a former state senator and top Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were indicted last spring on charges that include conspiracy and fraud.Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, pleaded guilty and is expected to testify for the government.Mr. Christie, who is campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, was not charged and denied having any knowledge of the alleged scheme until well afterward. A trial has been pushed back to mid-May, when most of the primaries will be over.Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly are accused of purposely closing two of three access lanes from Fort Lee, N.J., to the bridge in order to create traffic jams to punish the boroughs mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Mr. Christies re-election bid. Traffic around the bridge, which is one of the busiest in the country, was gridlocked for hours on four consecutive days.Later, Mr. Baroni told a New Jersey legislative committee that the lane closings were part of a traffic study  a fabrication, according to the indictment.Michael Baldassare, a lawyer representing Mr. Baroni, wrote that the charges against his client should be dismissed because they were based partly on the testimony to the committee, which was given under immunity.Whatever tortured legal theory the prosecution will offer in its own defense, the use of Mr. Baronis testimony before the New Jersey Legislature was and is inappropriate, Mr. Baldassare wrote. As discussed in Section II, the use of Mr. Baronis immunized testimony warrants dismissal of the indictment in its entirety.Both defendants say the government stretched federal laws to fit the conduct alleged in the indictment. They are charged with intentionally misapplying Port Authority property  the bridge  and with conspiring to deprive local residents of their constitutional rights to intrastate travel.Michael Critchley, representing Ms. Kelly, wrote that the first law had been used almost exclusively to prosecute public employees for theft or bribery. Civil rights laws, he argued, have never been applied to the intentional tie-up of traffic.There has been no other federal criminal case that has been prosecuted anywhere, at any time, with facts even remotely similar to the facts there, Mr. Critchley wrote.Mr. Baronis filing also says that prosecutors have not turned over potentially exculpatory evidence as required by law, particularly from the law firm hired by Mr. Christie to investigate the lane closings. The firms report in early 2014 exonerated the governor but also found no evidence that Mr. Baroni was involved in the alleged scheme.Prosecutors have until Feb. 24 to respond, and the defendants will have a chance to file a reply a few weeks after that, before a judge rules on the motion."}
{"text": "Though he wont be the next music director of the New York Philharmonic, Esa-Pekka Salonen isnt leaving anytime soon: Named the orchestras composer in residence last year, he remains in that position through the 2017-18 season. He programmed and hosted the Philharmonics latest installment of its Contact! new-music series on Monday at National Sawdust in Williamsburg, a rare foray to Brooklyn by a Lincoln Center institution.Mr. Salonen gave the evening a personal slant, and not just with the inclusion of his own Floof (Songs of a Homeostatic Homer), written in 1982, when he was in his mid-20s, and revised in 1990. He rounded out the concert with chamber works by three of his mentors and teachers, introducing each piece with witty, sometimes poignant reminiscences. (For one thing, it turns out that Franco Donatoni, with whom he studied in Italy, was apparently banned from the town center in Siena because of his kleptomania.)The predominant mood was of high yet forbidding spirits; there was barely an easy moment in the hour or so of music. But played with relish and precision by members of the Philharmonic and some guests, the works felt vital and thorny, full of character.Influenced by John Cage, Lutoslawskis String Quartet (1964) moves in unexpected directions: At times, the musicians cue one another to determine when one section is over and the next should begin, and the four players lines are supposed to function independently, overlapping largely by chance.The result felt like an assemblage of thistle-like fragments, insistent little motifs that hang together before dissolving. A violent burst from the cello egged the others on for a bit, and then there was yet another falling apart. This happened again and again: Aggressive wild goose chases came to unceremonious, seemingly random ends. A section marked Funbre found the four instruments in an impassioned, somber mood: mourning that was individual yet communal.Donatonis HOT for solo sopranino/tenor saxophone and small ensemble (1989) is an uproarious grafting of jazz instrumentation onto the vocabulary of modernism. Theres a big-band flavor  slapping double bass, squealing clarinet  but the musical lines are jagged and anarchic, held together on this occasion by the young conductor Joshua Gersen, the Philharmonics new assistant conductor.Eric Huebner, the Philharmonics pianist, made much of Niccol Castiglionis Dulce Refrigerium (1984), six short sacred songs. The little pieces are sometimes quietly gentle and sometimes quietly playful, but in Mr. Huebners hands, both modes felt unexpectedly epic.The songs were a calm preamble to the controlled chaos of Floof, which Mr. Salonen said was primarily influenced by Michael Jacksons Bad and Stravinskys Petrushka. Set to a surreal text by Stanislaw Lem, the work is a nonsense cantata that sends its soloist (here, the brave, dazzling soprano Hila Plitmann) from grunts and coughs to stratospheric high notes. A youthful work, but one that in this company harked back to Mr. Salonens brainily nutty forebears."}
{"text": "STOCKHOLM   Groundbreaking at the time, the 1959 Broadway play A Raisin in the Sun showcased to a wider public the struggles of a poor African-American family on the South Side of Chicago.The main characters  Walter Lee Younger and his wife, Ruth; his mother, Lena; and his sister, Beneatha  grapple with issues of race, dignity, generational clashes and dashed dreams.On Friday, the play will break different ground: It will be performed by an overwhelmingly African-Swedish cast here at the Riksteatern, in the first major Swedish rendition of the play.The play, originally written by Lorraine Hansberry, is expected to draw wide interest in a country whose tradition of welcoming newcomers from other cultures is threatened. Several recent reports have pointed to an increasing number of racially motivated attacks on Swedes of African descent, along with rising xenophobia amid Europes migrant crisis.The cast says it is important to show black actors in black roles and to stage a play that addresses discrimination in such a personal manner. Every day we rehearse, it becomes more important, said Josette Bushell-Mingo, an actress of African descent and the productions director.Why the play has not been done before is the question, she added.Swedens history with Africa dates to the 17th century, when it had minor colonies there, and, later, in the Caribbean. It lost those colonies to other European powers and abolished slavery in 1847. The work of Swedish missionaries in Africa in the 20th century brought some Africans to Sweden, particularly adoptees and students.From the 1970s onward, Sweden took in large numbers of African migrants and refugees, especially from conflict zones like the Horn of Africa.Representing various experiences, African-Swedes, those defined as residents with roots in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas and the Caribbean, number around 180,000, of whom 60 percent are foreign born, while 40 percent were born in Sweden, according to the Multicultural Centers Afrophobia Report of 2014, commissioned by Swedens ministry of integration.For decades, Swedens migrant, refugee and cultural policies have been open and tolerant. Critics, however, point to challenges of social and economic integration, citing huge disparities between the quality of life for African-Swedes and members of the larger society.In addition, a 2015 report by the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent pointed to rising hate crimes against African-Swedes.Afro-Swedes are most exposed to hate crimes, and reports of Afrophobic hate crimes have increased by 24 percent since 2008, the report said. In this context, hate crime units and investigators are insufficient. Many cases are reported, but few are investigated and prosecuted.Many here point to Swedens view of itself as a humanitarian society as part of the problem. Tobias Hubinette, an associate professor at Karlstad University and an author of the Afrophobia Report, said that there were many good things about Sweden but that they blind us to the disparities because we are not used to seeing them.The actors in this take of the Broadway classic, who represent various backgrounds and experiences of African-Swedes, were not hesitant to explain the challenges of integration in Sweden.Racism used to be very settled, a curiosity, said Kayo Shekoni, who is of Nigerian descent and plays the role of Lena Younger. Now its open, she said.The Internet has become a way for racist rhetoric to be exchanged, she said: People are scared, and we are scared.David Lenneman, whose father came from Gambia and whose mother is Swedish, was critical of the countrys official integration policies.You are told, you are not black, you are Swedish, but when you try to be Swedish, you are not allowed in, said Mr. Lenneman, who plays the role of Walter Younger.Generational clashes in the play also reflect the reality of many African-Swedes.When I told my mother that I wanted to do music, she was shocked, said Asha Ali, who is of Somali descent and plays the role of Beneatha Younger. Her mother, from a traditional society, did not approve of a career in entertainment.And while the play may shed light on Swedens integration challenges, the production also offers a different Swedish connection to Ms. Hansberrys work.In the early 1960s, Lisbeth Gronlund, who translated A Raisin in the Sun, was a Swedish high school exchange student in the United States. Her stay made her aware of the racial disparities in the country, so she decided to pursue studies in African-American literature when she returned to Europe. While conducting research for her masters degree, she corresponded with Robert Nemiroff, Ms. Hansberrys former husband and a promoter of her work.Mr. Nemiroff invited Ms. Gronlund to the United States to examine Ms. Hansberrys writings.I got access to what was then unpublished material, Ms. Gronlund said.When Ms. Gronlund returned to Europe, she translated the play and began looking for publishers. But no one in Sweden was interested  until now.Ms. Gronlund became aware through a friend that Ms. Bushell-Mingo, the director, was organizing a production of the play in Stockholm and was looking for someone to translate it. Ms. Gronlund contacted Ms. Bushell-Mingo to set up a meeting.When I understood who she was, I suggested that she just for the hell of it send in a translation of two of the scenes, Ms. Bushell-Mingo said. She recalled her reaction after reading them: It was, Wow!In addition to Ms. Gronlunds familiarity with Ms. Hansberrys work, her translation, Ms. Bushell-Mingo said, took into account working-class vernacular, befitting for the plays characters.I thought, thank goodness Im alive to experience this day, Ms. Gronlund said.Margaret B. Wilkerson, a professor emerita of dramatic art at the University of California, Berkeley, said she was thrilled to hear about the production in Sweden, but was not surprised.The play continues to be relevant to many, said Ms. Wilkerson, whose biography on Ms. Hansberry is expected to be released in 2017.Its a story about everyone who has felt a stranger in their own land, she said. How do you use literature to address issues that people dont want to hear about?The actors, who said they followed African-American pop culture and politics, including the Black Lives Matter movement, expressed their admiration for the play.Whats great about this production is that you are able to see yourself, Mr. Lenneman said. I can relate to that.Mans Clausen, who plays the roles of George Murchison and Bobo and was adopted from Ethiopia as a child, said he hoped the play would have a positive effect in Sweden.I hope it will be an eye-opener and an inspiration for the next generation, he said."}

The N.F.L. does not want to buy the tapes and has warned Haupt not to sell them to outside parties or else the league will pursue legal action.Unless the league and Haupt make a deal to resolve the financial differences that have privately divided them since 2005, the tapes will stay in storage in a former mine in upstate New York.This year had to be the year, with all the hype of Super Bowl 50, Haupt said.The tapes are a bizarre heirloom that, for decades, sat largely ignored in the attic of his familys three-bedroom house in Shamokin, Pa., deteriorating from shifting temperatures.Haupts father, Martin, taped the game. Haupt never knew him. Haupt and his mother, Beth Rebuck, say they have no idea what he did for a living back then. They also dont know why he went to work on Jan. 15, 1967, with a pair of two-inch Scotch tapes, slipped one, and then the other, into a Quadruplex taping machine and recorded the Green Bay Packers 35-10 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. He told his family nothing about his days activity.It would take another eight years for Martin Haupt to tell his wife what he had done. By then, they had divorced and both had remarried.He was sick with cancer and handed her the tapes.He said maybe they could help pay for the kids education, she said. And she put them in the attic, where they accumulated dust and intrigue.Martin Haupt died soon after, leaving behind the odd inheritance of a Super Bowl I recording, made on a professional two-inch machine in the era before the videocassette recorder industry exploded and networks and leagues began to cherish their archives of old games.Fortuitous Phone CallThe story might have ended with those two tapes deteriorating in Shamokin if not for a phone call from Troy Haupts childhood friend, Clint Hepner. In 2005, he read that Sports Illustrated had described a tape of Super Bowl I as a lost treasure because CBS and NBC had not saved copies of their broadcasts. The magazine estimated that a tape, if found, would be worth $1 million.He said, Remember when we were 10 and in your moms attic playing board games and saw this box with metal cases in it that said Super Bowl I? Haupt said. I had no idea what he was talking about and he said, Talk to your mom, and Mom said, Yeah, theyre up in the attic. She added: I remarried. The kids grew up and we talked about the tapes once in a while. But my husband was skeptical about what was on them.Haupt and his mother unspooled the saga in the sunroom of his house here on the Outer Banks that was built by its original owner to resemble a Coast Guard station. He was born the year after Super Bowl I and grew up a Dallas Cowboys fan in Philadelphia Eagles territory. He refers to his late stepfather, Charles, as his father, and Martin Haupt as his biological father.With Super Bowl 50 between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos approaching Sunday, he felt it was time to come forward as the owner of the tapes. For the past five years, he let his lawyer speak about an unidentified client who had the recording, who had made a deal with the Paley Center for Media in Manhattan to restore it and who was trying to sell the tapes to the N.F.L.But the league does not seem to agree with him that the tapes are a significant enough part of its legacy that it should pay him what he wants. It countered his initial request for $1 million with a $30,000 offer. It never raised its price and is not interested anymore in paying anything at all.Its awesome to have the tapes, but its frustrating that we cant do anything with them, Haupt said. Its like youve won the golden ticket but you cant get into the chocolate factory.Set to Tell His StoryLast month, the league countered in another way, showing that it did not need the tapes. NFL Network showed a reconstruction of Super Bowl I drawn from the archives of NFL Films.And last week, Haupt was angry about another turn in the dispute. CBS backed out of a plan to interview him for a Super Bowl pregame segment that would have used a few minutes from the game. It had agreed to pay him $25,000 and give him two tickets to the Super Bowl. A producer was preparing to watch a restored, digital copy of the game at the Paley Center. A crew was ready to go to Manteo. He was going to tell his story, and perhaps the league would listen.It was my right to tell my story, and they were paying me for it, Haupt said.But according to his lawyer, Steve Harwood, the deal collapsed when he was told that the N.F.L. had ordered CBS not to pay him.They said theyd still put Troy on but couldnt pay, Harwood said. After dealing with the N.F.L. all these years, and with CBS, which screwed up, Troy said he wouldnt do it for free.Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman, denied that the N.F.L. was involved.We didnt tell them not to do it, he said. We didnt talk to CBS about the payment.A CBS Sports spokeswoman said only that it chose not to do the feature because we couldnt get the appropriate clearances.With one click on the computer screen in the Paley Center viewing room, Super Bowl I came back to life. The recording is a relic that shows the signs of exposure to the heat and cold in the attic in Shamokin. Colors fade in and out. The picture is grainy and skips. And it suffers somewhat from Martin Haupts decision to stop or pause before most commercial breaks and hitting play when the break ended, which caused him to miss parts of the action when play resumed. The stops and starts give the tapes an occasional herky-jerky feel.And more important, he did not tape halftime and about half of the third quarter.Its like he thought he would run out of tape, Troy Haupt said.But it is still a viewable document, a vintage broadcast by CBS, with Ray Scott calling the first half with Frank Gifford, and Jack Whitaker taking over in the third quarter with a friendlier, wittier play call. Gifford referred regularly to Green Bay Coach Vince Lombardi as Vinny and kept promoting the Chiefs great play well after they were out of the game.A 1960s sensibility is preserved, helping to separate the tape from the NFL Films reconstruction.Each replay is labeled Video Tape and each slow-motion shot is noted as Slow Motion. The effect continues with network promos; an ad read by Whitaker (United States savings bonds that were recommended by President Johnson) and the commercials Haupt did not cut out (like the anchorman-like announcer promoting the taste and other benefits of True cigarettes).As the game entered its final seconds, Whitaker started to count down. Nine, eight, he said, and the game ended. A marching band ran onto the field. It played Seventy-Six Trombones.The first Super Bowl was always our holy grail of lost sports programs, appearing on our most-wanted list for years, said Ron Simon, the Paley Centers television and radio curator.A League WarningHaupt owns the recording but not its content, which belongs to the N.F.L. If the league refuses to buy it, he cannot sell the tapes to a third party, like CBS or a collector who would like to own a piece of sports history that was believed to be lost. He would like to persuade the league to sell the tapes jointly and donate some of the proceeds to their favorite charities. His mother said that she would give some of her share of the sale to the Wounded Warrior Project.Theyre not doing anybody any good sitting in a vault, he said. Lets help some great charities.But that is unlikely to happen. A letter from the league to Harwood last year provided a sharp warning to Haupt. Since you have already indicated that your client is exploring opportunities for exploitation of the N.F.L.s Super Bowl I copyrighted footage with yet-unidentified third parties, Dolores DiBella, a league counsel, wrote, please be aware that any resulting copyright infringement will be considered intentional, subjecting your client and those parties to injunctive relief and special damages, among other remedies.The law favors the league, said Jodi Balsam, a professor at Brooklyn Law School.What the league technically has is a property right in the game information and they are the only ones who can profit from that, said Balsam, a former N.F.L. lawyer.But, she added, the league has not handled the matter as well as it should have.It seems theyve misplayed their hand here, she said. Theyve known about this tape for years, and it seems to me they should have resolved this years ago, because its important footage.But until the league and Haupt resolve their differences, the public will never see the game as it happened, on the winter day when Green Bay became the champion of the N.F.L. and A.F.L., and Martin Haupt took a mysterious route to recording history."}
{"text": "As the results of the Iowa caucuses  Ted Cruzs narrow but humbling triumph over Donald J. Trump and Marco Rubio in the crowded Republican field, and Hillary Clintons razor-thin victory over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic contest  emerged on Tuesday morning, so did reactions and analysis from reporters, commentators and observers around the world. Below is a sampling.Even within his own party, some call Trump the fascist for his hatred and resentment toward foreigners, Muslims and Mexicans, whom he has described as criminals for immigrating to the United States. Now his nickname is the loser.  Salwa Zoghby, a reporter for El Watan, a newspaperThe results show that Iowans are torn between far-left and far-right ideologies. Peoples visions for the countrys future are conflicting. In the Republican camp, Cruz and Trump share similar right-wing ideas and had won more than half of the votes. Among the Democrats, support for the far-left Sanders reaches nearly 50 percent. It doesnt bode well for a country or a society when the far-left or far-right is the mainstream. Huang Xiaomin, a New York-based reporter at Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaperThe second-place finish of the anti-establishment Trump may create an optical illusion that the G.O.P. establishment had emerged victorious, but nothing could be further from the truth: in both parties, in fact, the established powers that be suffered a stinging defeat at the hands of its enemies on the edges. Half of the Democratic caucusgoers preferred the nonconformist senator from Vermont over the tried and tested Clinton; two-thirds of the Republicans gave their votes to Cruz and other candidates who are estranged from G.O.P. cliques, elites and benefactors. The extreme right and the radical left celebrated while the established, moderate center dissipated, as it has in many countries around the world, including Europe and Israel. Chemi Shalev, a New York-based correspondent for Haaretz, a left-leaning newspaperWhat is important to consider is that the process of the primaries produced Sanders as an alternative; without this process, we still wouldnt know how little support Clinton has from the Democratic base, and we would have never known Sanderss alternative program. In Hungary, in leftist-liberal circles, one wish often appears: the need for someone to finally motivate voters and challenge Viktor Orban. Candidates, however, dont come out of nothing  it is precisely a political process, similar to the primaries, that can produce them. Csaba Toth, political analyst and director of strategy at the Republikon Institute, an independent political research institute in Budapest, in Magyar Narancs, a liberal weeklyThe American dream is dying. Those on top let the middle class slip into poverty. The United States is on the wrong path. These are the words of the frustrated, frightened, embittered, desperate, enraged citizens of America. Theo Sommer, a former editor in chief and publisher of Die Zeit, a Hamburg-based weeklyHillary is vulnerable, and the tiredness and fatigue that have destroyed Jeb Bush apply to her, too. The novelty of being a woman is limited by the long, excessive habit to her name. Its a beautiful story, but its yesterdays story. Clinton will have to earn the nomination, and her path is full of mines, but Sanders wont survive the confrontation in the Southern states, where the African-American vote is crucial for the Democrat. Hillary is the sovereign designated by Obama. Only she, with the doubt of her past behavior as a secretary of state, can stop Hillary. Vittorio Zucconi, a journalist at the daily newspaper La RepubblicaTo note the following isnt to speak badly of Iowa or of the great Midwest prairie: this little state is in no way representative of the United States. With three million inhabitants, a 99 percent white population, most of it employed in agriculture, Iowa is hardly a national electoral sample. And yet it has the exorbitant privilege of opening the presidential primaries. And, at the very least, it gives an idea of the political climate. No surprise there: the weather is stormy. Editorial in the newspaper Le MondeLast nights results lay bare the scale and depth of the realignment that has been taking place within the country for almost a generation: a polarization of left and right that has made elections more volatile, politics more gridlocked and discourse more shrill. A socialist is in the running for the Democratic nomination; Donald Trump could be president. If these are the things we are saying in February, imagine what we might be saying come the Democratic and Republican conventions in July. Gary Younge, a columnist at The Guardian, a left-leaning newspaperIowa makes two things clear: Trump is not invincible, and Rubio has become the candidate of the power groups that control the Republican Party. Rubio is a conservative politician who has turned to the center and then back to the right in these primaries, and it seems that this strategy has produced results. The night will be bad for Trump, because much of his message is that he is a winner, a born winner. And to start by losing an election is not a good way to show that. Pablo Pardo, a Washington-based correspondent for El Mundo, a center-right newspaperCruzs rise is only marginally less remarkable than Trumps. The Calgary-born Texas senator, elected with the support of the Tea Party movement, is loathed by most of his Senate colleagues for his personality and his penchant for self-centered political stunts. He had faced attacks in recent weeks over everything from his church tithing to his stance on ethanol policy. Trump was particularly scathing, calling him Canada Ted and saying he was likely ineligible to run. But Iowas Republican electorate is heavily evangelical, and Cruz crisscrossed the state, from big cities to tiny farm towns, quoting Scripture and vowing to protect religious liberty and Judeo-Christian values. Trump, a profane and twice-divorced casino developer, had a harder time connecting. Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for The Toronto Star, a liberal newspaperCruz is a pioneer of the Tea Party, a movement before which many non-extreme conservatives (who hopefully will be the crushing majority in the final selection for their presidential candidate) hold their noses. A few months ago Trump began to utter idiocies against Mexican migrants and answer for his paradoxical condition as a poor idiot millionaire, and a few days ago he went to the extreme of affirming that if he killed someone right on Fifth Avenue, he wouldnt lose votes. But just when one thinks he has seen the worst, he is almost always wrong. Next to the wacko bird, the imbecile Donald should feel intelligent, liberal, progressive and even on the left.

{"text": "Martin Shkreli anticipated huge profits from raising the price of a decades-old drug for an infectious disease, belying any notion that helping patients was foremost in his mind, according to information released by congressional investigators on Tuesday.The investigators also provided evidence showing that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International carefully pondered how much it could raise the price of two old heart drugs, Isuprel and Nitropress, before buying them a year ago and increasing their prices overnight, by 525 percent for Isuprel and 212 percent for Nitropress.Mr. Shkreli practically gloated about the potential profits in an email he sent last August, just after his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, had paid $55 million to acquire the drug Daraprim, and had raised its price more than fiftyfold to $750 a pill, or $75,000 for a bottle of 100.So 5,000 paying bottles at the new price is $375,000,000  almost all of it is profit and I think we will get three years of that or more, Mr. Shkreli wrote in the email to someone the congressional staff identified only as an outside contact.Should be a very handsome investment for all of us. Lets all cross our fingers that the estimates are accurate.The email excerpt is included in a memo released by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, in advance of a committee hearing on Thursday about drug price increases.Mr. Shkreli left Turing after he was indicted on securities fraud charges in December.The House panel subpoenaed him to appear as a witness, but he has said he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right and not answer questions.He has also hired a new lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, replacing the lawyers at Arnold & Porter, a major Washington firm.Mr. Brafman is a seasoned New York criminal defense lawyer who has specialized in representing prominent defendants, including celebrities and members of organized crime families. His clients have included Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund; the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs, known variously as Puff Daddy, Diddy and P. Diddy; and the pop star Michael Jackson.Mr. Brafman said no decision had been made on what Mr. Shkreli would do with regards to Thursdays hearing.The memo released by Mr. Cummings contained excerpts and conclusions gleaned by Democratic staff members from more than 250,000 pages of documents provided by Turing. A separate memo about Valeant was based on 75,000 pages of documents from that company, whose interim chief executive, Howard B. Schiller, is expected to testify at Thursdays hearing.The committee did not release all the documents or even the entire text of the emails that were quoted.Turing said in a statement on Tuesday that it set the drug price to balance patient access to our existing drugs with investment in research and value generation for our shareholders. It said that in November  months after it set off public outrage for its price increase  it began offering discounts of up to 50 percent to hospitals that use large amounts of Daraprim.Valeant said in a statement on Tuesday that it was now offering discounts of up to 30 percent to hospitals on Isuprel and Nitropress.Weve heard from hospitals, as well as from Congress, that we set the price for these two drugs too high, it said.Mr. Shkreli, 32, gained attention in September after the huge overnight increase in the price of Daraprim, a six-decade-old drug that is the standard of care for toxoplasmosis, a serious parasitic infection.Mr. Shkreli has argued that Daraprim was such a small-selling drug that the price increase would not affect the health care system, and that the company would help with co-payments and take other steps to make sure that no patient would be denied the drug. He said the money from the price increase would go toward research on new drugs, and Turing is doing some such research.But some of the documents released by congressional investigators show some patients were being hit with co-payments as high as $16,800, and others of $6,000, and Turing was receiving protests from doctors.The documents also show Turing executives anticipated at least $200 million in annual revenue from Daraprim and were focused on the profits. Last Sept. 17, Tina Ghorban, senior director of business analytics and customer insights, forwarded a single purchase order for 96 bottles of Daraprim at the full price. Another $7.2 million. Pow! she wrote.One email to a commercial loan company in September said Turing was considering going public in the first quarter of 2016 and acquiring another drug, this time from Teva, that was also going to be a big price-increase deal with good upside.The recipient of the Aug. 27 email in which Mr. Shkreli gloats about the money to be made on Daraprim is Gregory Rea, a Florida radiologist. Mr. Rea, in a phone interview, said he did not want to discuss how he came to know Mr. Shkreli and did not want to comment on the email without going through my records.Mr. Rea was an investor in a private placement that KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, another company Mr. Shkreli briefly led, conducted in early December. Mr. Rea invested $3 million in the private offering on Dec. 4 that closed just days before Mr. Shkreli was arrested. KaloBios fired Mr. Shkreli soon after his arrest and filed for bankruptcy at the end of December.On Jan. 7, Mr. Rea and other investors in the private placement filed a lawsuit in the bankruptcy proceeding claiming they were fraudulently induced to invest in the private placement and KaloBios should have been aware of the pending criminal investigation against Mr. Shkreli. The investors, including Mr. Rea, are seeking a return of their investment.Another email was sent by Mr. Shkreli to an outside contact on Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, saying that the deal to acquire Daraprim would be announced on the following Monday. In a subsequent email, Mr. Shkreli estimated to the same unidentified contact that sales would be in the $200 million range, according to the documents.Regarding Valeant, the Democratic staff memo says the company identified the revenue goals for Isuprel and Nitropress and raised the prices to reach those goals.Before buying the two drugs in February 2015, the company hired a pricing consultant who concluded that there was ample room to raise the price because previous big price increases had not dampened use.One internal presentation showed that Isuprel and Nitropress had combined 2015 plan revenue of about $525 million, up from $153 million in 2014 under the previous owner. The explanation for the big increase was aggressive pricing through consultant recommendation.One email that got attention on Wall Street was sent May 21, 2015, from Mr. Schiller, who was then the chief financial officer, to J. Michael Pearson, Valeants chief executive. Mr. Schiller said that price hikes accounted for 60 percent of Valeants growth in the first quarter of 2015, or 80 percent if the company counted the contribution from the two heart drugs it had just acquired.That seemed to contradict comments made by Mr. Pearson on a conference call announcing first quarter earnings, where he said, Volume was greater than price in terms of our growth.A spokeswoman for Valeant said that when the company talks about this issue it refers to organic growth, excluding acquisitions.The company, which has taken big price increases on other products besides the two heart drugs, has been saying recently that it will rely on volume growth in the future. Mr. Pearson is on medical leave after the company said he was hospitalized with severe pneumonia just before Christmas."}
{"text": "Fox Sports has added the English-language rights to 25 games involving Mexicos national team to its arsenal of soccer properties.Through an agreement that will be announced Wednesday, Fox Sports 1 will televise 25 home games  friendlies and World Cup qualifiers  of the team called El Tri starting this year and continuing until the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Not all the home games will be played in Mexico, however; as part of an agreement with Major League Soccers marketing arm, Mexico has in recent years played an increasing number of its games in United States cities like Dallas and Los Angeles.The first game of the new Fox partnership will be a friendly on Feb. 10 against Senegal at Marlins Park in Miami. Two of Mexicos World Cup qualifiers this year, against Canada and Honduras, also are part of the new deal.Fox acquired the games from Univision Deportes for an undisclosed sum.For Fox, the contract represents another way to reach Mexican-born and second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans who follow the national team. Since Fox already owns the rights to several other important events featuring Mexico, the deal effectively makes Fox the English-language home of the team for the foreseeable future.We get to tell the narrative of the Mexican national team through our tournaments such as Copa Amrica Centenario this summer, and it is going to be the representative of the Concacaf region in the Confederations Cup in 2017, David Nathanson, the head of business operations for Fox Sports, said in a joint telephone interview with Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the president of Univision Deportes. This allows us to complete the story of arguably the team with the second-largest fan base in the United States.If the United States and Mexico advance as expected to the final round of regional World Cup qualifying, their showcase game in Mexico City will be carried by Fox Sports 1.El Tri is the jewel in the crown, Rodriguez said. In partnership with Fox, a huge, English-dominant network, we can help grow the property.The Mexican national team has shown the ability to generate large audiences. During the 2014 World Cup, the teams two group stage games on ESPN averaged 3.1 million viewers, and a group stage match on ESPN2 averaged 1.9 million. In the round of 16, the Mexico-Netherlands match generated 5.7 million viewers.And the two most-watched United States national team games on Fox Sports 1  excluding the Gold Cup  have been against Mexico.Without question, the biggest rivalry in our region is between Mexico and the U.S. and has been for decades, Nathanson said. It crosses all languages and all sorts of soccer fans.The three-year deal will feature 10 Mexican national team games this year and next year and five in 2018, when Fox will also carry the World Cup.Its our job, not only to showcase the most exciting competitions in the sport but to tell the story from broadcast to broadcast so our audience can follow the Mexican team, Nathanson said.In addition to the mens and womens World Cups through 2026, Fox also owns the rights to the Copa Amrica Centenario, a special edition of the South American championship to be played in the United States in June; UEFAs Champions League and Europa League; the F.A. Cup in England; Germanys Bundesliga; Major League Soccer; Concacafs Champions League and Gold Cup; and the Scottish Premier League.

On Tuesday, organizers announced the majority of their feature lineup, this year including 89 world premieres.The lineup usually ranges from smaller work to Hollywood productions, and also includes movies from festival alumni. One of those is Ti West, who has made his name in the indie horror scene and brings his latest, the revenge western In a Valley of Violence with Ethan Hawke, to the festival. The comedian, filmmaker and actor Mike Birbiglia also has a new movie making its world premiere, Dont Think Twice, about an improv group that loses the lease on the theater where it performs.While Janet Pierson, the film festivals producer, said she saw fewer trends in the narrative selections compared with previous lineups, the documentaries frequently shared one similarity.I noticed a vein of people who had created something themselves, often with community, Ms. Pierson said in a phone interview. Examples include Thank You Del: The Story of the Del Close Marathon about the improv comedy mentor. And The Hollywood Shorties, about a group of dwarf actors who, wanting to be athletes, put together a basketball team. Insatiable: The Homaro Cantu Story looks at a chef and inventor who tried to change the way people eat.The narrative spotlight section includes 9 Rides, about an Uber driver who gets big news during a busy shift. And From Nowhere looks at three undocumented Bronx teenagers trying to finish school and remain in the United States.The festival is continuing with its showcase of television premieres. Girls, Silicon Valley and Mr. Robot have all gotten their starts there. This years potential TV lineup includes Vice Principals, a show from Danny McBride and Jody Hill about competitive administrators at a high school, and Outcast, based on a comic book, about a man burdened by demon possession.These titles join the announcement of the opening-night film, Richard Linklaters Everybody Wants Some, along with other prominent entries like Pee-wees Big Holiday and the Jeff Nichols film Midnight Special.

JAMES PARISH$3.5 MILLION ($7 MILLION BARBADIAN DOLLARS)A gravel driveway off the main road in Fitts Village, on Barbadoss west coast, leads to this three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath house with a natural coral stone finish and a red tile roof. The two-story, 1,859-square-foot house, on a lot of about 0.20 acre, was built in 2005 along a public Caribbean beach and includes an adjacent lot. The house is also available on a single lot of slightly more than 0.10 acre for $2.25 million, said Rae Stollmeyer, who is known as Muffin, the head of sales for West Coast Villas Sothebys International Realty, the listing agent.A walled courtyard leads to a double front door with an arched transom window. A staircase is to the right of the entryway. Straight ahead, the galley kitchen includes a small work island. Creamy wood cabinetry houses the appliances. A glass block and mirrored backsplash is set behind a sandy-toned granite countertop with a single sink.A powder room and a laundry room are off a small hallway to the right. All the bathrooms have granite countertops, Italian tile and marble finishes. The house is air-conditioned and has wireless Internet access. It is being sold furnished.Beyond the kitchen, the living room has a wood plank ceiling, a ceiling fan, cushioned wicker furniture and an entertainment center with a television, a DVD player and a radio. Louvered doors open to a terraced tiled stone patio with an outdoor dining table and lounge chairs. Three steps down, a jacuzzi and a barbecue are on the larger terrace. A gate opens onto the beach.Arched doorways at each end of the living room open to a dining room with a mahogany table, glass block windows, louvers and skylights.A bedroom to the other side of the living room opens through louvered doors to the beachfront terrace. It has an en-suite bath with a single vanity and a shower.Upstairs, side-by-side bedrooms have vaulted wood-plank ceilings with exposed beams painted white and ceiling fans. Louvered doors open to a covered balcony overlooking the terrace and the Caribbean Sea. The en-suite master bath is outfitted with two vanities and a skylight; the en-suite guest-room bath has a single sink. Glass-block showers are in both upstairs bathrooms.The house is midway between the capital of Bridgetown and the small town of Holetown. Supermarkets, banks, shops and medical services are nearby; dining spots like Cin Cin by the Sea and the Cliff are also on the west coast. Golf courses at Sandy Lane and Royal Westmoreland are a short drive away. Polo, yachting, deep-sea fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling are popular activities. Grantley Adams International Airport is 40 minutes away via the ABC Highway.MARKET OVERVIEWThough prices in Barbados have not returned to 2008 levels, they are getting there, Ms. Stollmeyer said. We definitely had a great year last year and continue to have a great year this year, she said.Cherita ODell, a broker with Million Dollar Homes and Barbados Real Estate 246, said that during the downturn, you had to make decisions to reduce property prices by 20 percent and even then, it was not like before. Prices on many overinflated properties eventually came down to what they should have been, she said.The south coast of this island of around 290,000 residents, where luxury beachfront condominiums range from $3.75 million to $5 million in United States dollars, is a bargain compared with the west coast, where they fetch $4.25 million to $10 million, Ms. ODell said. Condominiums on the south coast across from the beach run from $450,000 to $650,000.Standalone beachfront homes start at $2.25 million, Ms. Stollmeyer said. The asking prices on eight villas, ranging from 8,100 to 9,675 square feet, at the new enclave One Sandy Lane begin at $19 million. Beachfront condominiums, rented when not in use by owners, make up the most popular segment of the market.A two-phase development completed last year near Speightstown on the northwest coast, Port Ferdinand Marina and Luxury Residences, has 82 luxury residences and 120 berths on a horseshoe-shaped marina. Two penthouses are on the market for $7.75 million. Two- to four-bedroom homes with private berths range from $2.25 million to $4.25 million.WHO BUYS IN BARBADOSAmericans and Canadians lean toward the more budget- and family-friendly south coast in Christ Church parish, Ms. ODell said. Because the strong British pound makes it so much more affordable, British buyers predominate in St. James and St. Peter on the west coast, also known as the platinum or gold coast, she said.Most foreign buyers are second-home owners, including many retirees and snowbirds, Ms. Stollmeyer said. Most American buyers come from New York, she said. Some buyers also come from Miami, which, like New York, offers direct flights.BUYING BASICSForeign buyers must register the funds they are using to purchase the property with the Central Bank of Barbados in order to obtain automatic permission to buy, said Aron David Truss, a lawyer based in St. James, Barbados. There are no other restrictions on foreign buyers.Some offshore banks in Barbados offer foreign buyers a mortgage option. However, the process is difficult and a little expensive, Mr. Truss said. Almost all of my clients are cash buyers.Both local and foreign buyers should retain a local lawyer to advise on the sales contract and investigate the property title, according to Mr. Truss. Many property titles are still unregistered, so proof of ownership is in the form of deeds, he said.WEBSITESBarbados Government site: gov.bbBarbados travel: barbados.orgBarbados tourism: visitbarbados.orgLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Bajan; Barbadian dollar (1 Barbadian dollar = $0.50)TAXES AND FEESThe annual land tax, equivalent to a property tax, on this house is $2,636 a year.Sellers pay about 3.5 percent of the purchase price for stamp duty and property transfer taxes.

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO   Yahoo is moving full speed ahead  in every direction.The Internet pioneer said on Tuesday that it was open to offers for its core assets, which would represent the end of Yahoo as an independent entity. That is a shift from the companys position as recently as December.Yahoo is also proceeding with plans to spin out those core assets. That would leave its most valuable property, its holdings in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, in the original company. Investors like that idea.But what Yahoo is really focusing on is revitalizing itself under the guidance of Marissa Mayer, who has been chief executive since the summer of 2012.What I am trying to do is reassure people, Ms. Mayer said in an interview. You could classify it as a call for patience. I am asking shareholders to understand this is a complicated situation.In a conference call with analysts, she added: It is going to be very busy.Very busy, and very riveting. Whether the intense, glamorous and controversial executive will get more time to fix the company promises to be one of Silicon Valleys most prominent dramas of 2016. The next move is up to activist investors, who can try to elect a new slate to the Yahoo board.The company said on Tuesday that one of its directors, Charles Schwab, was resigning because of other demands on his time.Whether it is sold or survives, Yahoo is getting smaller. It said on Tuesday it would lay off about 15 percent of its 11,000 employees. By the end of the cuts, the company said its work force would be about 42 percent smaller than it was in 2012.In addition to being smaller, Ms. Mayer said, the company would be simpler. Yahoo will shed assets, cut expenses and focus on the areas of the company that are growing. When she arrived at Yahoo after working as an executive at Google, she said, We were sitting on $5 billion in deteriorating revenue with no clear path to growth.In essence, she said that Yahoo was no longer deteriorating and was poised for better times  not in 2016, perhaps, but 2017.Investors seemed not quite sure how to react to the news, which came with the release of Yahoos quarterly results. Yahoo shares, which slumped for most of Tuesday as the overall market fell, at first perked up. But in after-hours trading, the stock declined slightly.The company is open to all options, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. There is a distinct possibility that Yahoo as an independent company no longer exists within two years.Starboard Value, a Yahoo investor, accused the board in January of neglecting its responsibilities by ignoring potential offers and dragging its feet in coming up with plans to spin off its core assets.Each quarter is worse than the last, Starboard wrote in a letter, adding that requiring another year for shareholders to wait while the existing leadership continues to destroy value is not acceptable.Starboard did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But SpringOwl Asset Management, a firm whose investors have been publicly critical of Yahoos management, were not satisfied with the proposed changes or happy about Ms. Mayers attitude.I expected defiance, and I expected a convoluted solution, said Eric Jackson of SpringOwl. My expectations were exceeded on both counts.He noted that Yahoo, despite supposedly being willing to entertain offers, did not mention hiring an investment firm to facilitate the process. It remains to be seen whether this is a real shift or not, Mr. Jackson said.Ms. Mayer said in the interview that the company already had retained advisers to help with the spinoff, and they would help evaluate any offers for the core assets. The board, she said, would be receptive to offers.Yahoos language on Tuesday is likely to formally begin what could be months of inquiries from both strategic and financial suitors. Some have been open in expressing their interest: Late last year, Verizons chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, said at a conference that he would look at buying Yahoo if it were put up for sale.Others, including private equity firms, have been quietly studying a potential acquisition of Yahoos web businesses, according to people briefed on the matter. Some firms, like Silver Lake and TPG, previously weighed bids for a minority stake in Yahoo in 2011 when the company was under pressure from different activist shareholders.As Ms. Mayer looks to complete her fourth year as chief executive, Yahoo stubbornly remains a marginally profitable company that is not growing. That was underlined in its fourth-quarter earnings report.Revenue came in at $1.273 billion, compared with $1.253 billion in 2014. Operating earnings were 13 cents a share, in line with forecasts. Last year, Yahoo earned 30 cents a share in the quarter.Yahoo also recorded a $4.46 billion charge in the quarter for certain businesses, including its blogging site Tumblr, which it acquired for $1 billion.Mr. Jackson of SpringOwl said that Tumblr had been Ms. Mayers signature acquisition, and that she had increased the number of employees when she began at Yahoo. Shes saying, Were going to sharpen our focus, he said. Why didnt she do that three and a half years ago?Yahoos stock, and Ms. Mayers tenure, have been propped up by the companys wildly successful investment in Alibaba. A plan to spin off the shares to investors faltered when the Internal Revenue Service refused to bless the deal. In December, Yahoo said it would instead spin off its core assets while leaving the Alibaba stake in the original company.Kenneth Goldman, Yahoos chief financial officer, said in the conference call, I do feel comfortable that we can do it this year.Yahoo was a mess when Ms. Mayer arrived from Google. The executive suite was a revolving door. The companys market share in search was dropping. Yahoo Mail was an also-ran and efforts in mobile were minimal.Ms. Mayers hiring drew the worlds attention. But at a moment when Google and Facebook, either of which Yahoo might once have been able to buy, are roaring ahead, there is still no clear sense of what Yahoo should be. Supporters of Ms. Mayer say the company would be in worse shape without her.Statistics released this week by eMarketer, a research firm, showed just how much Yahoo was struggling.In 2015, Yahoo captured $3.37 billion in digital ad revenue worldwide, or 2 percent of the market, eMarketer estimated. That is down from a 2.4 percent share in 2014. Mobile ads were equally dismal.In search, Yahoo is barely holding its own. It will capture 2.1 percent of the $94.07 billion worldwide search market this year, the same share as in 2015, eMarketer said."}

{"text": "A young seminary student from Ohio flew across the United States on Friday in pursuit of a goal he had spent weeks discussing online in explicit detail: finding a baby, either through adoption or cash purchase, to sexually assault, the authorities say.The flight was the first leg of an itinerary that was to lead to Mexico, but the seminarian, Joel A. Wright, was arrested at San Diego International Airport before he could continue the trip.Unbeknown to him, he had been trading emails with undercover federal agents.Mr. Wright was arrested by Homeland Security Investigations, part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he had spent almost two years searching for female children under the age of 4 in Tijuana, Mexico, for a violent sexual encounter.This investigation opens a window into a secret world where sexual predators prey on young children around the globe, Dave Shaw, a special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego, said in a statement.Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Wright on Friday with felony counts of traveling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and aggravated sexual abuse of a child, according to the complaint.The seminarian made his first court appearance on Monday in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. He did not enter a plea and remained in custody, said Kelly Thornton, a spokeswoman for the United States attorneys office in San Diego.Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal appointed public defenders to represent Mr. Wright and scheduled a detention hearing for Thursday. Federal prosecutors filed a motion to keep Mr. Wright in custody, deeming him a flight risk and a danger to the community.A preliminary hearing in the case was scheduled for Feb. 11.Mr. Wright was studying to become a Roman Catholic priest at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Columbus, Ohio. The Rev. John Allen, vice president of the college, described Mr. Wright as a former student and said the college was shocked and saddened to learn of the heinous and reprehensible crimes he had been accused of.He said the seminary was eager to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation.Mr. Wright began his search on the Tijuana section of Craigslist, where he posted an advertisement in 2014 looking for a child to adopt, according to a criminal complaint filed on Friday.He traveled to Mexico that July after someone responded to the ad, offering him a child. But the response was part of a swindle: He met the person in a hotel and paid an adoption fee, but the person never delivered. Mr. Wright returned to the United States alone.The person in Tijuana was central to the investigation against Mr. Wright, according to law enforcement officials, who declined to provide details about that persons identity.The seminarian and the con artist encountered each other on Craigslist again a year later, when Mr. Wright posted an ad looking for a tour guide in Tijuana. The person who had defrauded him, using a new email address, sent him a response.During their correspondence, Mr. Wright said he was traveling to Mexico, in part to find a woman to marry and a child to adopt. Eventually, he said, he was interested in sexually assaulting female infants.The person contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Alexandria, Va., which forwarded the tip to the Department of Homeland Security.The person handed control of an email address to Homeland Security on Dec. 3, 2015, and agents continued the conversation with Mr. Wright. He wrote in graphic detail about his plans to adopt or rent female infants to sexually assault, according to the criminal complaint.Those conversations continued for one week, during which Mr. Wright promised his online contact gifts of a vintage European military jacket, DVDs and a 4-year-old girl after I finish, law enforcement officials said.Investigators bought him a plane ticket to San Diego on Dec. 10, but he backed out at the last minute, the complaint said. He said he wanted no further contact with them.But 18 days later, the seminarian was back on Craigslist. He posted another ad looking for a female tour guide in Tijuana. The same person saw it and replied again, using a third email address and posing as a guide.Soon, their conversation turned to violent sexual assault of children, the complaint said.In email passages reprinted in the criminal complaint, Mr. Wright discussed his sexual fantasies and said he planned to pay the parents of a baby girl so he could adopt/own her. The cheapest baby girl under 3 would be good, he wrote.Homeland Security assumed control of the email account again on Jan. 19. Ten days later, Mr. Wright boarded a flight to San Diego. He expected his online contact to pick him up at baggage claim. Instead, agents swooped in and arrested him."}
{"text": "Lady Gaga will pay tribute to David Bowie in a special segment at the Grammy Awards, the organizers of the show announced on Tuesday.After Mr. Bowie died last month, speculation in the music industry immediately turned to how his songs and influence would be recognized at the awards show. Would it be a huge revue or a solo performance? An honor paid by fellow legends from Mr. Bowies generation, or something showing his impact on younger artists?Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the Grammys, said in an interview that Lady Gaga had already been booked for the show before Mr. Bowie died. But as soon as the news emerged, Mr. Ehrlich said, he began discussing a possible tribute with the singer and her manager. Over the next week, Mr. Ehrlich added, he was contacted by numerous other artists who wanted to participate  some of whom might have made sense; the vast majority didnt, he said  but he stuck to the idea of Lady Gaga solo.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that was conducted before Mr. Bowies death on Jan. 10, Lady Gaga said: When I fell in love with David Bowie, when I was living on the Lower East Side, I always felt that his glamour was something he was using to express a message to people that was very healing for their souls.Her performance at the Grammys will not be the opening number for the show, but it will probably last six or seven minutes, Mr. Ehrlich said, and cover at least three or four songs. Nile Rodgers will be the segments musical director. The show, on Feb. 15, will be broadcast live by CBS; previously announced performers include Adele, Kendrick Lamar, the Weeknd, Carrie Underwood and Sam Hunt. There will also be a tribute to Lionel Richie, who is the Recording Academys 2016 MusiCares person of the year.Lady Gagas performance, Mr. Ehrlich said, is going to be a true homage to who David was, particularly musically, but not ignoring his influence on fashion and pop culture in a broader way.Mr. Ehrlich, who has been involved with the Grammys since 1980, said it was always a rush to book the performances for the show in the couple of months between the nominations and the broadcast. But this year has been particularly difficult with the deaths of so many music figures over the last few weeks, including Lemmy Kilmister of Motrhead, Natalie Cole, Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane. Mr. Ehrlich said he expected to pay tribute to Mr. Frey in some way, and also that he had already booked a multi-artist tribute to B. B. King, who died last May."}
{"text": "The story is starting to sound familiar. A chef at the pinnacle of the culinary world commits suicide.This week, it was Benot Violier, a 44-year-old Swiss chef who reportedly used a hunting rifle to take his life. His jewel box Restaurant de lHtel de Ville in a suburb of Lausanne had a top rating in the Michelin guide. In December, it was named the finest restaurant in the world by La Liste, a new ranking guide developed by the French government.The reasons someone chooses suicide are complex and deeply rooted. Swiss police are still investigating the death, and officials there said Mr. Violiers family had requested privacy so that they can grieve in peace and calm.Still, his death echoes those of the Chicago chef Homaro Cantu, 38, who hanged himself in April, and the French chef Bernard Loiseau, 52, who used a gun to kill himself in 2003. In both cases, people close to the chefs said they were feeling tremendous job pressure.Mr. Violiers death has underscored a growing concern among some in the restaurant industry that not enough is being done to address mental health issues exacerbated by the seemingly endless pressure to deliver perfection in a physically and creatively demanding profession dominated by lightning-fast criticism and often unrealistic expectations of success.We are living in a time and a place where we should be way more culturally aware of the flip side of the culinary success stories we hear about, said Andrew Zimmern, the chef, writer and television personality who fought drug and alcohol addiction before becoming an advocate for removing the stigma that surrounds mental illness.Sadly, it takes situations like this for people to start talking about the issues, he said.Kat Kinsman, a food writer and editor at large of Tasting Table, in January began a project called Chefs with Issues to address what she says is a deep, unspoken current of mental health challenges running through professional kitchens.Although mental illness cuts across every profession, restaurants have unique pressures and lifestyle patterns that can contribute to suicide or other destructive behavior, she and others in the field said.Its hot and reactive and intense, and there is no way you can leave that at whatever hour you get off work and just be a normal person, she said. Pressure builds up, and it has to go somewhere.As part of her project, Ms. Kinsman conducted an informal survey on her website that asked food professionals to report stress, mental illness and addiction related to their jobs. More than 600 people responded, a number she said was vastly higher than she had expected.Many of the people who responded said they avoided seeking help because they didnt want to be thought of as crazy or weak, Ms. Kinsman said. The work often attracts a certain kind of nonconforming personality that enjoys competition and embraces both long, hard shifts and an excess of food, drink and drugs  all of which can exacerbate mental issues like depression.The tragedy is that this is food, which on the outside should be a nurturing thing and a source of pleasure, she said. It breaks my heart that people providing this fundamental and generous thing would be in such pain themselves.For chefs who also own restaurants and have elevated public profiles, the layers of pressure go beyond the urgency to deliver perfection on a plate under the excruciating deadline of dinner service.Financial stakes are high and the margins of profit are often surprisingly slim, even at the best restaurants. With public opinion and professional criticism coming at chefs with lightning speed in the digital age, restaurants and reputations can fall seemingly overnight.Thats the stuff that really wears on you because you are responsible for other peoples livelihoods, said Michael Mina, a California chef who employs about 1,700 people at restaurants across the United States. If you dont get a good review, it hurts personally. But it hurts the employees because losing business means losing jobs. Its so competitive in cities like San Francisco that just to stay in business you have to be at the top.Mr. Mina likened being a chef to the life of an elite athlete or an actor, although one who has to perform every night. And unlike a tennis star or a singer, he added, a star chef has to be a business executive, a leader, an artist and sometimes a plumber  often all on the same day.Whether attention to mental health issues will become part of restaurant culture is still unclear. Those pushing for it point to the attention paid to recovery from drug and alcohol abuse, which has become more accepted in professional kitchens in the past decade.A restaurant job, particularly in an ambitious kitchen, can be all-consuming. The work starts in the morning and can stretch past midnight. Working weekends and holidays is often a given. The average hourly pay for a line cook is $11.40, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But low pay and long hours are, for some, a badge of honor.Some chefs are working hard to make shorter hours and more balance between work and life outside the restaurant part of the culture. It prevents burnout, they say, improves the food and keeps turnover lower.We dont want managers who get rewarded for working the guys 60 or 70 hours a week, said Ashley Christensen, who employs 270 people in her seven restaurants in Raleigh, N.C.Still, the industry is filled with people who feel guilty or worry for their jobs if they work what most people would consider a normal schedule, she said.And even if restaurant workers do want to seek help for mental issues, there are few resources designed especially for people in the field. Restaurants are struggling to offer health care benefits, and the median pay for food servers, beverage servers and related employees is about $8.72 an hour, according to the National Restaurant Association.This is not a profession that affords you the money to be able to go and seek out help, Ms. Kinsman said."}
{"text": "The advance of the China National Chemical Corporation, a state-owned company, on Syngenta leaves Monsanto in a thorny spot.The Chinese company, known as ChemChina, is nearing a deal for Syngenta, the Swiss seeds and pesticides maker. Its friendly nature and the cash involved probably make it better than a similarly valued offer last year from the American rival Monsanto, whose merger options are getting tougher.Having kicked off the industrys mating season, Monsanto is for now on its own. It made repeated overtures to Syngenta to combine the worlds leading players in seed production and crop protection. Its most recent offer was 470 Swiss francs in cash and stock per share in August 2015.Syngenta argued that Monsanto was trying to buy it on the cheap at a low point in the agrochemical cycle, but it now looks ready to accept a similar price from ChemChina. By offering all cash, the Chinese company could wind up being less intrusive for both employees and senior management.Monsanto can try to argue that ChemChinas bid is problematic anyway. Competition concerns seem unlikely, but theres a risk that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will fret over Chinese ownership. That Syngentas stock price is still 16 percent below the expected sale price suggests that investors do harbor some doubts.Even so, Monsanto would probably need to sweeten its offer to overpower ChemChinas. Its last one is now worth about 426 Swiss francs for each Syngenta share. Matching ChemChinas figure, even with just 75 percent cash, would increase Monsantos debt to more than four times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, analysts at Bernstein say, a risky level given the weak commodity cycle.Alternatively, Monsanto could look elsewhere. The merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont puts additional pressure on it to find a deal partner. BASFs crop protection business is the third-largest in the sector and would make a sensible target. But BASF, a German conglomerate, has no need to sell low when the business is in a slump. There may be other joint ventures available to Monsanto, but the M.&A. seeds are looking harder to sow."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.   Emboldened by Donald J. Trumps defeat in the Iowa caucuses, conservative leaders and rival candidates for the Republican presidential nomination began to challenge him aggressively in New Hampshire on Tuesday, aiming to cut into his wide lead here and perhaps even to embarrass him by denying him victory in a second consecutive state.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, having prevailed in Iowa, teased Mr. Trump for having attacked him bitterly on the way to an embarrassing loss. Jeb Bush released a commercial in which he called Mr. Trump a man of deep insecurity and weakness. Gov. Chris Christie sarcastically called him Donald the Magnificent. And former Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, an elder statesman of the state Republican Party, branded Mr. Trump a loser with a string of business failures behind him.For the first time, Republican leaders opposed to Mr. Trumps candidacy said they believed there was a chance to break his grip on New Hampshire as the party establishment closes ranks around a smaller number of candidates and Mr. Trump faces new threats on the right.On the Democratic side, too, the nomination fight quickly descended on New Hampshire. Hillary Clinton, who won in Iowa by the narrowest of margins over Senator Bernie Sanders, declared in Nashua that she would battle the Vermont senator in a contest of ideas here leading up to the primary on Tuesday.The state has been receptive to Mrs. Clinton in the past, and revived her candidacy in the 2008 primary after her defeat in Iowa by Barack Obama.But Mr. Sanders has held a solid advantage in the New Hampshire polls, and his campaign has projected confidence about its prospects. He told reporters that his performance in Iowa was a show of strength against Mrs. Clintons powerful political operation, and vowed to stay in the race until the Democratic convention in the summer.It was the Republican race, however, that appeared more unsettled on Tuesday. Mr. Trump has towered over the Republican presidential race for months, but the campaign here took on a distinctly new tenor and urgency in the aftermath of Iowa.For Mr. Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the third-place finisher in Iowa, the caucus results were a pretext to argue, more forcefully than ever, that it was time for the party to pick them instead of Mr. Trump.Both senators hope to extend their momentum in New Hampshire, with Mr. Cruz looking to peel away Mr. Trumps supporters on the hard right and Mr. Rubio working to consolidate votes from more mainstream Republicans and independent voters.Mr. Trump, meanwhile, was uncharacteristically silent for much of the morning  until he began to grumble, on Twitter, that he had been denied due credit for a silver medalists performance in the caucuses. Late in the afternoon, Mr. Trumps campaign announced he had won the endorsement of Scott P. Brown, the former Massachusetts senator now living in New Hampshire.At a campaign stop in Milford, N.H.  his first public appearance since Mondays defeat  Mr. Trump told reporters that he expected to keep his lead in the state. I think we will finish first, he said. I would like to finish first.The extent of Mr. Trumps vulnerability in New Hampshire is still a question mark. He has long led the polls here by wide margins, and even as he conceded defeat in Iowa, Mr. Trump bragged that he was ahead in New Hampshire by 28 points. (It was unclear what poll he was citing.)The determination to take on Mr. Trump transcends the different political camps on the Republican side in New Hampshire. Gordon Humphrey, a former senator and a longtime conservative activist here, said frustrated Republicans finally had a chance to thwart Mr. Trumps campaign, thanks to the people of Iowa.Mr. Humphrey, who is supporting Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, said Mr. Cruz would probably draw the most support directly away from Mr. Trump. But in the process, he said, Mr. Trump could become more susceptible to a challenge from the more traditional Republican candidates.Trump has been looking good mainly because the sane vote has been so broken up, so fractured, Mr. Humphrey said. Now, less so.For three candidates who fared poorly in Iowa  Mr. Christie, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich  the New Hampshire campaign has become a fight for survival. Long eclipsed by Mr. Trump, they now must also contend with Mr. Rubios status as the only candidate outside the hard right to perform well in the caucuses.Mr. Kasich acknowledged at a stop in Claremont on Tuesday that he could not afford a lopsided loss in the state. If I get smoked in New Hampshire, he said, Im going home. And on Monday evening, Mr. Christie set a kind of bar for his own performance, telling voters in Hopkinton that he expected New Hampshire to narrow the field to just four or five candidates.Among Democrats, there is no expectation that the New Hampshire primary will be conclusive in the race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are the only two candidates left, after former Gov. Martin OMalley of Maryland withdrew on Monday night. Both have access to tens of millions of dollars in campaign funds, and they have amassed national networks of supporters who are unlikely to desert them.But each appears determined to make an important symbolic point in New Hampshire. For Mr. Sanders, it is his best opportunity to win an early primary outright and to gain more traction nationally as the race heads to larger, more urban and diverse states, where Mrs. Clinton is seen as holding an upper hand.And Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday appeared determined to deepen the contrast between herself, as a candidate of liberal beliefs but pragmatic instincts, and Mr. Sanderss more rigidly ideological message. In an MSNBC interview broadcast Tuesday night, she said the country had to get back to the big center, politically. Weve got to get back to solving problems, she said.No Republican is likely to get such a clean shot at making the empty-promises case against Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.Over the last few weeks, the race here has erupted in extravagant hostilities among the right-of-center Republicans, as the candidates and their supporters have delivered increasingly venomous attacks in speeches and paid advertisements.Even as these candidates took on Mr. Trump with renewed vigor Tuesday, they also redoubled their attacks on one another. Mr. Christie referred to Mr. Rubio in acid terms at a morning event, describing him as the boy in the bubble who had never faced a truly taxing political test.The evening before, perhaps anticipating the outcome of the caucuses, Mr. Bush derided both Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz as legislative backbenchers, who have never done anything of consequence in their lives.Though Mr. Trump may yet prevail in New Hampshire, there was a palpable sense of relief among Republican leaders in the state and nationally, as the prospect of a Trump sweep in the early primary states evaporated.With victories in both Iowa and New Hampshire, it would have been difficult to slow his advance in the race without a painful, monthslong nomination fight against the most overtly ruthless candidate in recent memory.Shannon McGinley, a leading conservative activist, said the Iowa outcome had buoyed Mr. Trumps detractors here.For a lot of folks who are really upset about the idea of having Trump as our nominee, it gives us hope in America  not as crazy and lost as we thought it might be, said Ms. McGinley, who added that she decided this weekend to support Mr. Rubio."}
{"text": "Give me a leafy salad any day. Make it romaine, butter lettuce, watercress, red oak or a mixture of sturdy midsize leaves, and dress it simply with a good vinaigrette or with nuts, fruit and cheese. In cooler weather, compose it with as many kinds of multicolored chicory as possible.The well-loved Italian chicory called radicchio, now common in North America, comes in many guises. The round-headed radicchio di Chioggia is the most readily available, but others, like the elongated Treviso and the curly fingered Tardivo, are increasingly popular. They sport various shades of red, from burgundy to crimson to oxblood.The chicory family is a large one, though, and other members come in other colors, such as the fetchingly speckled yellow-cast Castelfranco; pale green broad-leafed escarole; curly endive (blanched for salads); or pointy Belgian endive, which can be ivory or pink.All chicories feature a pleasant, bittersweet flavor, which requires a somewhat assertive vinaigrette. A lemony, garlicky anchovy dressing is a delightful choice, one I often employ with these vibrant leaves, sometimes with a garnish of chopped egg. Another classic option is a mustard vinaigrette made with red wine vinegar and crisp bacon lardons  like the traditional French bistro curly endive salad  or a zesty, peppery blue cheese dressing.Chicory pairs handsomely with citrus fruit: Use blood orange, grapefruit, kumquat or tangerine, with a citrus dressing. Or try a shallot and balsamic vinegar dressing with walnut oil and toasted walnuts.Another approach is to grill or broil. Split the chicory lengthwise and cut the halves into wedges before letting them char a bit. Serve warm or at room temperature, napped with vinaigrette.Of course, you dont want to drown these brilliant leaves, even if they can take a bit more dressing than tender lettuces. I find it best to give them a sprinkle of salt and only a few tablespoons of dressing, tossing to coat every leaf. Let the salad sit for a few minutes and taste it before adding more.You may use just one chicory if you wish (say, all Belgian endive or radicchio), but a crisp bowl filled with a multitude of varieties is a gorgeous, mouthwatering sight to behold.Recipes: Colorful Chicory Salad With Anchovy Dressing | More SaladsAnd to Drink ...Salads are difficult to pair with wine, primarily because of the vinegar so often used in dressings. Vinegar and wine are like oil and water; they almost physically repel each other. Its often easier on wine to use lemon juice in dressings rather than vinegar. But some wines will work with a vinegar dressing, particularly one like this with anchovy, garlic and mustard. These Mediterranean ingredients will go well with a crisp ros. If its any time but summer, this may pose a problem because many ross have a short life span. But good Provenal ross, Chteau Ste.-Anne for one, have the structure to last for a few years. These ross, or their equivalent, will be delicious. If you dont have one on hand, a dry, lively white will do. Or you could try a Manzanilla sherry. ERIC ASIMOV"}

{"text": "LONDON  The Swedish private equity firm EQT Partners said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the tourism company Kuoni Group in a deal that would take the Swiss firm private.Kuoni was founded in Zurich in 1906 by Alfred Kuoni and organized its first guided overseas tour to Egypt the next year.Under the terms of the deal, which valued Kuoni at 1.39 billion Swiss francs, or about $1.36 billion, EQT said it had offered 370 francs a share, a 21 percent premium on the closing price on Monday.The offer represents a 60 percent premium on the 60-day, volume-weighted average price of Kuonis shares on Jan. 4, the day before it confirmed it was talking with potential bidders, EQT said.Over the last months, the board has very carefully analyzed all strategic options in order to secure the successful implementation of Kuoni Groups strategy, Heinz Karrer, the Kuoni chairman, said in a news release.The board concluded unanimously that taking Kuoni private and handing over the responsibility for the group to an internationally renowned new owner with comprehensive experience in managing and further developing industry leaders, with the necessary financial strengths and with a long-term perspective, would be the ideal solution to the benefit of all stakeholders, he said. EQT fulfills all these requirements in the best possible way.Kuonis board has recommended that shareholders accept the EQT offer.Shares of Kuoni jumped 18.8 percent to 362.5 francs in midmorning trading in Zurich on Tuesday.The Kuoni and Hugentobler Foundation, Kuonis long-term anchor shareholder, is supporting the transaction and has reached an agreement with EQT regarding the governance and future development of the company, EQT said.The board of trustees supports the takeover offer, Karl Hofstetter, the chairman of the foundations board of trustees, said in a news release. We also reaffirm our intention to remain invested in Kuoni as long-term shareholder.The offer is subject to acceptance by more than 50 percent of Kuonis shareholders, including shares held by the Kuoni and Hugentobler Foundation.The offer also is subject to regulatory approval.It is our ambition to enable Kuoni to strengthen the leading market position of its businesses both through organic growth and acquisitions, Michael Bauer, an EQT partner, said in a news release, and to further increase the attractiveness of Kuoni for clients, business partners and employees.Kuoni acts as a distributor of accommodation and services to travel providers and operates a visa services unit for 48 countries. It posted revenue of 3.4 billion francs in 2014 and employed about 8,000 people.It announced plans last year to focus on its core business of providing services to the global travel industry and agreed to sell its tour operations in Europe and its tour operations in Hong Kong and India.EQT was advised by JPMorgan Chase and the law firms Br & Karrer and Latham & Watkins."}
{"text": "Last month, more than 1,200 Turkish and foreign academics signed a petition calling attention to the continuing humanitarian crisis in many Kurdish-majority towns in southeastern Turkey, which are the site of fighting between the Turkish Army and the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K. The petition decried the Armys shelling of urban areas and the imposition of weekslong, 24-hour curfews, which have left many civilians unable to bury their dead or even obtain food. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly denounced the signers as so-called intellectuals and traitors. Within days, antiterror police had detained and harassed dozens of the signatories.Mr. Erdogans actions shouldnt have been surprising. The president has a history of jailing journalists and cracking down on media companies critical of his policies. And yet this time the response from his supporters was exceptionally chilling: A pro-Erdogan organized crime boss proclaimed, We will take a shower in your blood, while the office doors of some of the academics were ominously marked with red crosses.Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who as a former academic might have been expected to come to his colleagues defense, announced that he did not regard the petition as falling under the rubric of free speech. He then set out on a trip to several European countries in order to encourage foreign investment in Turkeys foundering economy. In Britain and Germany, Mr. Davutoglu received a warm welcome from Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor Angela Merkel. The European Unions response to the latest crackdown on dissent in Turkey amounted to little more than a statement calling the persecution of the academics extremely worrying.Many prominent Western academics and non-governmental organizations have been vocal in censuring the persecution suffered by their Turkish counterparts. The European Unions lack of action on Turkeys crackdown on academic freedom and human rights would therefore be inexplicable but for one crucial detail: As the European Union faces its largest refugee crisis since World War II, the 2.5 million Syrians currently in Turkey are a huge bargaining chip for Ankara. Europes leaders are well aware of this.Just weeks before Turkeys early elections on Nov. 1 , Ms. Merkel came to Istanbul to meet with Mr. Erdogan and strike a deal: If Turkey helped stem the flow of refugees into Europe, Germany would help push forward talks on Turkeys membership in the European Union. Many people fear that Ms. Merkel offered another compensation in exchange for help on the refugee issues: The European Union would tolerate Turkeys human rights violations and its reckless handling of the Kurdish conflict.The United States, which has crucial air bases in Turkey, cannot afford to alienate the Erdogan government, either. When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Turkey recently, he made a point of meeting with journalists who had been fired under government pressure. But afterward, Mr. Biden declared that the Turkish government was the United States strategic partner  an apparent gesture of reconciliation by Washington. Like many Western governments, the Obama administration has distanced itself from Mr. Erdogan since his suppression of the Gezi Park protests of 2013.The diplomatic balancing act cannot go on indefinitely. The Syrian Kurdish group known as the Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D., a branch of the P.K.K., is an American ally on the ground against the Islamic State and has received American military aid. Meanwhile, Turkey continues its attempt to overthrow the regime of Bashar al-Assad by supporting Jaish al-Fatah, a Syrian rebel group that includes the Nusra Front, Al Qaedas Syrian branch.Turkey and the United States also do not see eye to eye when it comes to the Islamic State. Washington views the group as a high-priority threat and is pressuring Turkey to build a wall along its 60-mile border with the territory the jihadist group controls. Ankara, by contrast, sees the Islamic State as a symptom of a larger problem  Bashar al-Assads continued presence in Damascus  and is entreating Washington to back an Islamist-dominated rebel group. The United States is ill at ease about this state of affairs, yet believes it has no choice but to stand behind Mr. Erdogan.Turkey and the European Union are in a more complex entanglement. At present, the European Union wields considerable leverage over Turkey, both as the market for more than 40 percent of its exports and as the arbiter of its long-stalled membership bid. Europes current strategy of placating Mr. Erdogan for the sake of its own short-term interests is misguided. As the Paris and Istanbul attacks have shown, Europe and the Middle East are part of one open system: Chaos and conflict in one region is sure to have repercussions in another. The millions of Syrians seeking refuge in the West, as well as the thousands of jihadists going to Syria from Europe, are now Europes problem  a problem that cannot be solved by building walls.With the Middle East ravaged by religious radicalism and sectarianism, the European Union and the United States cant afford the Turkish governments brutal military efforts against the Kurds or its undemocratic war on academics and journalists. Only a secular, democratic Turkey that can provide a regional bulwark against radical groups will bring stability to both the Middle East and Europe. As Mr. Erdogan seeks to eliminate all opposition and create a single-party regime, the European Union and the United States must cease their policy of appeasement and ineffectual disapproval and frankly inform him that this is a dead end."}
{"text": "LONDON  J Sainsbury, one of Britains largest grocery store chains, said on Tuesday that it had agreed on the terms of a bid to buy Home Retail Group in a deal that would value the acquired company at 1.3 billion pounds, or about $1.9 billion.The transaction, if completed, would expand Sainsburys online business and make the company less reliant on food sales. Home Retail is the owner of Argos, which sells electronics, housewares and other products through its online operations and retail stores in Britain and Ireland.Like many of its British peers, Sainsbury has faced pressure to cut prices as the German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl have cut into their market shares.The renewed bid came before a Tuesday deadline by the British takeover regulators for Sainsbury to make an offer or walk away for as long as six months. Home Retail said last month that it had rejected an earlier approach Sainsbury had made in November.The Home Retail deal would give Sainsbury a much larger footprint, by adding 840 Argos stores in Britain and Ireland to its more than 1,200 supermarkets and convenience stores in Britain. The transaction would also significantly raise Sainsburys online presence by acquiring Argos and its extensive delivery network in Britain.The combination is an opportunity to bring together two of the U.K.s leading retail businesses, with complementary product offers, focused on delivering quality products and services at fair prices, through an integrated, multichannel proposition, Sainsbury said in a news release.On Tuesday, Home Retail said that its board of directors was willing to recommend the main financial terms of the bid, which values the company at about 161.3 pence a share.Whilst the board of Home Retail Group continues to believe in the prospects for the stand-alone company, it recognizes that the possible offer will provide an attractive opportunity for Home Retail Group shareholders to receive a full valuation for their shares, Home Retail said in a news release, and, through their shareholding in the combined group, also to participate in the value created by the combined group from the transaction.The British takeover authorities have agreed to allow a three-week extension until Feb. 23 for Sainsbury to make a firm offer for Home Retail.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would receive 0.321 shares in the combined company and 55 pence in cash for each share they own, equivalent to about 1.1 billion. Home Retail shareholders would own about 12 percent of the combined company.They would also receive 25 pence a share from the sale of Homebase, a British home improvement chain, and 2.8 pence a share in lieu of a final dividend, equivalent to an additional 200 million in capital being returned to shareholders. Wesfarmers Limited of Australia agreed to acquire Homebase last month for 340 million.Morgan Stanley and UBS advised Sainsbury, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Home Retail."}
{"text": "When Han Kangs surreal, violent novel The Vegetarian was published in South Korea nearly a decade ago, literary critics found it baffling. The story stars an unhinged heroine who believes shes turning into a tree, and features some of the strangest erotic passages in literature. (In one unforgettable scene, Ms. Han renders clichd sexual metaphors about flowering plants and protruding pistils quite literally.)The mesmerizing mix of sex and violence was not what fans and reviewers expected from Ms. Han, a celebrated and award-winning poet and novelist.It was received as very extreme and bizarre, Ms. Han said in English during a recent telephone interview from her home in Seoul. Definitely, readers were surprised.Even more surprising was the rapturous reception that followed. The Vegetarian became a cult international best seller. Publication rights have sold in nearly 20 countries. It was adapted into a Korean film that played at Sundance in 2010.Still, Ms. Han, who has been publishing fiction and poetry for more than two decades, remained almost entirely unknown to English-speakers.That is starting to change, thanks largely to Deborah Smith, a 28-year-old British translator who read a Korean edition of The Vegetarian four years ago, when she was studying for her Ph.D. at the University of Londons School of Oriental and African Studies. She was transfixed by the unusual story and vivid, chiseled prose, and attempted to translate it herself, but wasnt fluent enough yet to capture Ms. Hans style. A year later, she tried again, and sent a short sample translation to a British publisher, who decided to publish the novel based on the first 10 pages.It was very visual and painterly, Ms. Smith said. The reason that I wanted to translate her in the first place is that I think she is the best writer they have.It remains to be seen whether The Vegetarian, which is being released in the United States this week by Hogarth, will resonate with American readers. But it is causing a stir in literary circles. The book has drawn a string of ecstatic early reviews, including those in Publishers Weekly, Booklist and Kirkus, which called it gracefully written and deeply disturbing. Independent booksellers are rallying around it. Literary novelists like Lauren Groff, Helen Oyeyemi and Eimear McBride have heaped praise on Ms. Hans hypnotic prose.Enthusiasm spread like a virus in the way that you always hope will happen, Molly Stern, the publisher of Hogarth, said. Well see if that virus spreads into the reading public.The story centers on Yeong-hye, a melancholy housewife who is haunted by violent dreams that drive her to stop eating meat. Her abusive husband views her vegetarianism as an act of rebellion, while her brother-in-law becomes obsessed with her increasingly emaciated figure and her bluish birthmark, and lures her into performing in his sexually explicit video art. Like a cursed madwoman in classical myth, Yeong-hye seems both eerily prophetic and increasingly unhinged when she begins starving herself, hoping to transform into a tree.Ms. McBride, the author of A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, said she was struck by the alignment of extraordinarily lyrical prose with incredibly brutal content.The tension between the two creates a very singular effect within the reader; a sense of complete immersion and utter disorientation all at once, Ms. McBride wrote in an email. The technical achievement is astonishing and all the more so because she never allows you even a glimpse at the seams.If Ms. Han gains a broad American readership, she will be one of the first South Korean authors to do so. While American publishers have become more willing to take risks on works in translation, particularly since the commercial success of international authors like Elena Ferrante, Karl Ove Knausgaard and Haruki Murakami, literary imports from South Korea remain scarce. Just a few prominent contemporary South Korean novelists have been published in the United States, including Young-ha Kim and Kyung-sook Shin.Some scholars, editors and translators say it is a shame that South Koreas vibrant and diverse literary culture has been largely overlooked by Western publishers, even as other Korean cultural exports like K-pop have spread across the globe. There are so few works of Korean literature in translation, especially contemporary stuff, said Ed Park, a Korean-American novelist and executive editor at Penguin Press.More books are starting to trickle in. Three years ago, the independent publisher Dalkey Archive Press started its Library of Korean Literature series, a translation program financed in part by the Literature Translation Institute of Korea. Dalkey has published 19 translations so far, including contemporary novels and 20th-century classics, and will release six works of Korean fiction this year.Last year, AmazonCrossing published the Korean author Bae Suahs acclaimed novella Nowhere to Be Found. Hogarth has acquired a second novel from Ms. Han, Human Acts, which takes place in 1980 in Gwangju, South Korea, where a boy searches for his friends body after a violently suppressed student uprising. The novel won Koreas Manhae Literary Prize last year, and Ms. Smiths English translation came out last month in Britain, where it was well received.Ms. Han was born in 1970 in Gwangju. Her father, Han Seung-won, a novelist, struggled to make a living from his writing, and her family moved frequently when she was young. It was too much for a little child, but I was all right because I was surrounded by books, she said.When she was 9 her family moved to Seoul, just four months before the Gwangju uprising in 1980, when government troops attacked pro-democracy protesters, firing on the crowds and killing hundreds. Though she didnt witness it directly, the crackdown profoundly shaped her views of humanitys capacity for violence, but also for compassion and redemption. Her fascination with those contradictory impulses drives much of her fiction, and gave her the idea for The Vegetarian.I was thinking about the spectrum of human behavior, from sublimity to horror, and wondered, is it really possible for humans to live a perfectly innocent life in this violent world, and what would happen if someone tried to achieve that? she said.She studied Korean literature at Yonsei University, and published her first poems in 1993. Her first novel, Black Year, a mystery about a missing woman, was released in 1998. Around that time, she had the idea for a short story about a woman who becomes a plant, and who is lovingly tended by her husband. The concept was inspired partly by a line from the Korean poet Yi Sang, who wrote, I believe that humans should be plants.She always intended to return to the plant woman, but wrote two other novels before returning to that theme around 2004.Ms. Han spent three years working on The Vegetarian, which she wrote as three separate novellas. She has published three other novels since, but said she is still attached to her heroine and the story, which ends on an ambiguous note.I didnt want to describe Yeong-hyes death, she said. I wanted to keep her alive."}
{"text": "Donald Trump was at the top of each of the last 10 polls in Iowa, but his lead failed to hold up on caucus night Monday. In the end, his seven-point lead in polling averages amounted to a three-point loss to Ted Cruz.That 10-point swing was enough to make Mr. Trumps defeat the biggest polling error in an early primary since Hillary Clinton defeated Barack Obama in New Hampshire in 2008. But even that measure understates the extent that the polls misjudged Mr. Trumps strength.Mr. Trump was at 31 percent in the final polls, but finished with just 24 percent. In our data set of early primary polls from New Hampshire and Iowa since 2004, no candidate underperformed the final surveys by as much as Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton, for instance, mainly beat Mr. Obama by outperforming her polling, not because Mr. Obama fell short.Its probably not a coincidence that the candidate who underperformed the polls by the most is also the one who had a mediocre turnout operation and enjoyed seemingly nonstop media coverage.Its always hard to figure out why polls are wrong, but this time the stakes are higher. Republican strategists have hoped for months that Mr. Trumps lead was an illusion. The results in Iowa at least raise the possibility that theyre right  which would call into question Mr. Trumps advantage elsewhere.This time there is evidence to support one of two possibilities for why polls overestimated Mr. Trump: Voters broke strongly against Mr. Trump in the final days, or the electorate was more conservative and more religious than polls anticipated.In general, there are three basic ways polls go wrong: an unrepresentative sample that doesnt accurately reflect the population its trying to measure. a flawed likely-voter model that misjudges the composition of the electorate. late events or changes in the race after the poll was conducted that moves voters.This year, there is extremely strong evidence to support the late movement scenario, some evidence to support the likely-voter problem and little evidence to support the sampling problem  even if it cant be ruled out.The case for late movement away from Mr. Trump is very strong. The entrance polls showed that voters who decided over the last week broke heavily against him, and for Marco Rubio.Whats more, the only two surveys conducted after Jan. 29 provided a certain amount of confirmatory evidence. They arent the best polls in the world, but they showed Mr. Trump leading by just one percentage point, with 27 and 20 percent of the vote  his two lowest tallies in more than a week. The same surveys showed Mr. Rubio rising to 19 and 22 percent  his two strongest showings of the campaign.If late movement explains Mr. Trumps defeat, its good news for pollsters. Theres nothing they can do about the possibility that undecided voters will break away from a candidate at the last minute.It doesnt necessarily answer whether Mr. Trumps lead should be expected to hold elsewhere. On the one hand, you can make a solid case that the final weeks of the race should naturally pose a very difficult challenge for him. He has benefited from tremendous media coverage and has faced relatively few attacks. This changed in the final few weeks before Iowa, as voters started to tune in and focus on other candidates, and as Mr. Cruz began attacking Mr. Trump far more forcefully than he had been attacked before.This would be the worst-case possibility for Mr. Trump. It would mean his support really might evaporate ahead of future contests, as voters focus on other candidates and as he faces even more attacks.But its also possible that voters broke late because of Mr. Trumps strange decision not to participate in the final debate. The entrance polls did not ask voters whether they were less likely to vote for him because of that decision, but its certainly possible.This would be the best-case explanation for Mr. Trump: If skipping the last debate did it, then he can simply avoid making the same mistake again. On balance, though, theres not a lot of evidence to support this conclusion  and entrance polls showed Mr. Trump losing among voters who decided over the last month, not just over the last few days.There is also a case that Mr. Cruz benefited from a more evangelical Christian electorate than pre-election polls assumed. The entrance polls showed that evangelicals were 63 percent of the electorate, while most pre-election polls showed a much lower tally. The final Selzer poll, considered to be one of the most reliable polls, had evangelical voters at 47 percent of the electorate.Mr. Trump lost evangelical Christians to Mr. Cruz by a 12-point margin, 33 to 21 percent.Mr. Cruz would not be the first conservative candidate to outperform Iowa polls. In fact, its pretty common. Pre-election polls showed a close race between Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney; Mr. Huckabee won by nine points. They showed Rick Santorum trailing Mitt Romney significantly; he won, although one could attribute that to late momentum, not a poor measure of the electorate. Pat Robertson outperformed the polls in 1988.The list of moderate candidates who underperformed is just as long, and Mr. Trump did best among self-identified moderates.One easy explanation is that the most conservative voters are among the partys most committed, longtime activists who regularly attend caucuses, and that polls conducted by mainstream media organizations do a poor job of incorporating them into their likely-voter models. Thats because they dont buy the list of past caucus attendees, which is collected by the state parties and sold at a considerable cost. When asked during a phone survey, voters often misreport how much theyve participated in the past.But this is probably not the whole explanation. Mr. Trump, after all, only won 29 percent of the nonevangelical vote  even less than the 31 percent he held overall in pre-election polls. If thats right, Mr. Trump would have underperformed the pre-election polls, even with a 100-percent nonevangelical electorate.Whats more, the proportion of voters who were very conservative was actually fairly low, at 40 percent of voters  well beneath the 47 percent from 2012. Mr. Cruz won very conservative voters by a far greater margin than he did among evangelicals.And the turnout was, as Mr. Trump might put it, huge. Nearly 187,000 people turned out, or more than a 50 percent increase over 2012 levels. Pre-election polls all showed that Mr. Trump would benefit from a stupendous turnout, but few anticipated a turnout of anything near this level. Even Steve King, the Iowa congressman and Ted Cruz backer, said turnout needed to be around 135,000 people or lower for Mr. Cruz to win. Given the huge turnout, Mr. Cruz might not have even targeted as many voters as he actually won, making it harder to argue that it was his vaunted field operation that put him over the top.So it is a stretch to argue that Mr. Trump lost simply because of the turnout, given that it vastly exceeded just about every pre-election benchmark for a Trump victory.In the end, we rarely know exactly why polls are wrong. None of the public pollsters will be able to go back and see whether the people they thought would vote actually did. They could call voters back and find out whether they voted and for whom, but voters tend to over-report voting and over-report voting for the candidate who won, so its not clear whether theres much to learn.Whats clear, though, is that Mr. Trump woefully underperformed  even with the benefit of a big turnout. This type of a miss usually cant be easily explained by one single factor. Multiple causes were probably at play. Some may be specific to Iowa. Others might not be, and may represent a lasting problem for Mr. Trump.It could be exactly what his opponents have been hoping: a sign that hes not as strong as he and the polls have been saying."}
{"text": "Of the many beautiful things about good red Burgundy, the most striking is the way the wine keeps changing before you. From the moment you open a bottle and pour the first glass, a cascade of elusive aromas and flavors captures your attention.They begin gently and delicately, perhaps reminding you of enticing flowers and red fruits. With a little time, they may toughen, with suggestions of rocks and metals, even animals, before sweetening again. They reel you in, toss you back, and just when you believe the wine has reached equilibrium, it changes again. The mind reels. The spirit soars.Forgive me if I sound hyperbolic. Thats how I feel about Burgundy. Its not magic, but it is mystery, and no wine more than Burgundy conveys the inscrutability at the core of all great wines.Forget that rising demand for Burgundy in the last 20 years has sealed its status as a luxury commodity, sending prices soaring. Its enigmatic beauty is what enchants true Burgundy lovers.Here at Wine School, we dont try to demystify wines like Burgundy. We embrace whats wondrous about them as part of their allure. But we do try to understand the different stories that wines have to tell, and we try to be open to hearing them.For the last month, weve been drinking, and listening, to Burgundy. More specifically, weve been drinking Marsannay; that is, wines from pinot noir grown in the commune of Marsannay, the northernmost village of the Cte dOr, the heart of Burgundy.Given the ever-evolving aromas and flavors, Burgundys story may appear to be inconsistent. But while some may suggest that Burgundy is moody and fickle, I would argue instead that its underlying nature is fidelity to its terroir.As usual in Wine School, I recommended three bottles, all Marsannays from the 2013 vintage: Domaine Trapet Pre et Fils; Domaine Bart Les Echezots and Domaine Sylvain Pataille Clos du Roy.I chose Marsannay because in the context of the Cte dOr, its a modest wine. As is true throughout the Cte dOr, the vineyards are organized hierarchically.At the bottom are the regional wines, made from grapes that come from anywhere within the borders of Burgundy, known as Bourgogne Rouge.At the next level in quality are wines that may be labeled Ctes de Nuits-Villages, from the northern half of the Cte dOr, or Ctes de Beaune-Villages, from the southern half.The next step, wines from vineyards deemed good enough to bear the name of a particular village, like these three Marsannays, represents a big leap in quality. Some of these village vineyards may even bear a particular name often referred to as a lieu dit, like Les Echezots and Clos du Roy.Next up are the premier cru vineyards, which are thought to have special characteristics, and at the apex are the grands crus, vineyards considered to have such distinctive potential that they transcend the character of any village.The reason Marsannay is thought to be modest is that not only are no grand cru vineyards within the village limits, there are no premier cru vineyards either. The vineyards of Marsannay only achieved village status in 1987. Before that, the grapes were used for regional wines or to make a pretty good ros.This sense of modesty helps keep prices down in relation to other village Burgundies. Still, at $30 to $50 a bottle, these wines are not cheap, and many readers chose to skip this months discussion. I would never dictate to anybody how to spend a wine budget. But I would say that red Burgundy is a fundamental wine. Simply to know it can be endlessly rewarding.The best thing about Marsannay, especially in the hands of good producers like these three, is that the quality far surpasses modest expectations, which makes these wines good values and excellent introductions to the possibilities of Burgundy.Those who were able to find any of these wines or Marsannays from other good producers seemed to agree.Martin Schappeit of Amherst, Va., tried the Pataille with an herb-stuffed chicken. It made me feel euphoric and energized, he said. I was completely taken by surprise.Others echoed his reaction. Drinking this made me feel cosseted and lucky and perhaps privileged, Ferguson wrote, while John Fraser of Toronto said drinking the Marsannay made him feel warm, cheery.More so than most other wines, good Burgundies stimulate the emotions. Often, in an effort to master a wine, we focus instead on rational responses and analyses: Does it reflect the vintage? How does it compare with other pinot noir wines? Is it tannic? Balanced? What methods were used in the winery? How was it farmed? All worthy questions, and helpful for understanding a wine.But its crucial to pay attention to emotions, too. This is the joy of wine, and especially of Burgundy. The further you explore, the more you get to know its complexities, the deeper and more profound the emotional response.The emotions are predicated on years of intellectual study, beginning centuries ago with Cistercian monks, who found a calling in parsing the varying characteristics of the vineyards. When you can smell, taste and  for those whove visited Burgundy  even see the land and its people in a bottle of wine, its stirring.Sadly, who nowadays can afford the grand crus, which can cost many hundreds, even thousands of dollars? The better premier crus, too, can run in the hundreds.Thankfully, we still have the pleasures of wines like these Marsannays, which can give some idea of Burgundian notions of terroir. For the record, I loved them all, though each differently. The Bart, for me, was perhaps the simplest and most direct, a riot of fresh, almost brilliant red fruit with an underlying earthy minerality. Of all the wines, I thought it changed the least in the glass.The Trapet, by contrast, seemed ever-changing. Straight from the bottle it was earthier and more tannic than the Bart, with darker, spicier flavors. With time, and especially with food, a stew based on this terrific recipe for pinto beans with bacon, the tannins receded and the wine became savory, almost saline, with an anise quality.The Pataille was fresh like the Bart but richer, a seamless blend of red fruit, flowers, minerals and exotic spices. It seemed as elegant as the Trapet did rustic.Despite the individual characteristics of each wine, they all meet as expressions of Marsannay, medium-bodied wines with pretty red-fruit and floral aromas and flavors. They may evolve over the course of a meal.With the accompanying chicken, the cherry became a strawberry aroma, said Mel Winokur of New York City, while Cjmoore of Eugene, Ore., wrote, They also changed constantly as we sniffed, tasted, then enjoyed with cheeses and our dinner.Thats what Burgundy does, one of the many things that make it beautiful."}
{"text": "Like many New Yorkers, I have convinced myself that a rickety fire escape platform is a terrace and that a segment of the Empire State Buildings antenna seen through a sliver of window constitutes a panoramic skyline view. The same capacity for wishful self-delusion must be what keeps us going to bistros that are nothing like anything in France.The chalkboards in painstaking cursive that misspell half the menu; the sad frites and scrawny mussels and refrigerated cheeses; the old-guard dishes put through modern contortions until they end up looking like Grard Depardieu wearing Jeggings  we put up with these signs of forgery because we want the real thing so badly.To get it, we need to go to France. But right now, the most perfect substitute bistro in New York is Benoit.It took Alain Ducasse, who owns the century-old original in Paris, a few years to get its Midtown incarnation right. Its odd the way Benoit does some dishes so well but misses the bulls-eye with mainstays that should get the most finicky attention, Frank Bruni wrote shortly after it opened in 2008, pinning one star on his review in The Times. A year later, in an unstarred update, Julia Moskin found a menu that was coming into focus but still carried an occasional hint of airline food. She also wrote that the servers seem to hope that dinner customers will leave early and stay away forever.Philippe Bertineau isnt cooking airline food. He is the restaurants third chef. With any luck, Mr. Ducasse wont need a fourth for a long time.The menu works like a season at the Metropolitan Opera. A core of preposterously old-fashioned classics is rounded out with a few modern compositions to keep everybody on their toes.To understand the point of keeping rafter-rattling war horses in the repertoire, all I had to do was eat Benoits quenelles de brochet. These two little footballs of happiness are improbably smooth, almost but not quite fluffy, filled with the freshwater richness of pike. Each one is enveloped in a thick brown gravy of Nantua sauce that is 10 times richer, made from crayfish and lobster. I tasted it, and the whole chorus marched out on the stage at once, the orchestra pounding and the fat lady throwing her head back and letting it rip. A standing ovation would have followed if Benoits quenelles hadnt made me feel a bit like the fat lady myself.Even more inimical to hopes of mobility was Mr. Bertineaus cassoulet. A gleefully debilitating arsenal of duck confit, duck sausage and cured pork, it is also a magnificent pot of tender baked beans soaked in garlic and fat. Either the meat or the beans could slow your speed. Together they act like an anchor.The calfs liver, an oblong lobe shaped like Argentina, was seared to a dark gold in the copper saut pan that escorted it to the table. A step beyond the medium-rare the server had suggested, it was still very good. It had no overcooked livery flavor, just the ripe tang of organ meat that dissolved into very soft Lyonnaise potatoes and onions.To begin, there is darkly concentrated onion soup, choked with melted Gruyre that seems never to run out. Snails in the divots of a heavy glazed dish have a wafer of parsley crust on top thats almost as fun to eat as a rag of bread dunked in their garlic butter.Obviously, like so much of Benoits menu, these appetizers predate the electrocardiogram. It is possible to start with something lighter. Regulars often tick off choices on the hors doeuvres list, a separate sheet of paper that comes with a golf pencil: a poached and oil-marinated sardine; crisp sticks of celery root in rmoulade that may need more mustard; ham with flageolets and a handful of other dried beans, each cooked until just tender; the egg mayo, on the menu since opening day. Five of these little dishes served together make an excellent $19 lunch, a kind of Lyonnaise bento box.The greatest bistros in France are magnetic because they are invariable; you know the classics will be made the same way they were 15 or 45 years ago. Benoit is not always this kind of bistro, though this may be a symptom of its distance from Lyon. The pt en crote, from an 1892 recipe, can be dry and underseasoned. The filet mignon au poivre can be dullish, although the pepper-cream sauce puts up a strong fight.In compensation, though, Mr. Bertineau cooks almost as well outside the bistro canon as inside it. He shows this with seafood especially.One night, my guests, elbow deep in a wild boar stew, threw me looks of pity: poor guy, stuck with king salmon, butternut squash and black-trumpet mushrooms. I didnt let on, but I was perfectly content. The fish, roasted gently, was crazily tender and the white-wine sauce so appealing that I spooned way more than I needed from the sauceboat left on the table. (The right French sauce can be a dish in itself.)The baba is not as spectacular at it was at Alain Ducasse New York before that restaurant closed. The cakes halves can be too sober, depending on whether the server applies the Armagnac as if hes putting out a house fire or baptizing a baby. But other vintage desserts can restore the faith of any New Yorker whos been brought down by bland mille-feuilles or watery crme caramels or confused tarte Tatins.The servers on my recent visits showed no impatience with lingerers; they simply went about their business with that straight-spined, matter-of-fact French-waiter style. This is sometimes mistaken for rudeness but is closer to pride and a confidence that everybody, including the customers, knows how to act.Its strange that it took Mr. Ducasse to give New York its most convincing version of this very un-cheflike style of cooking. That a highly traditional bistro survived while the other, more inventive restaurants with which he hoped to conquer Manhattan did not is peculiar, too  a missed opportunity for the chef and New Yorkers, who love French food even when it doesnt love them back."}
{"text": "Cam Newton surprised many people last week when he said that race played a factor in how he was perceived as a quarterback. In an interview session with members of the news media on Tuesday, he declared the subject closed, at least as far as he was concerned.I dont even want to touch on the subject of black quarterbacks because I believe this game is bigger than black, white or even green, Newton said in San Jose, Calif. We limit ourselves when we label ourselves.When Newton was challenged by some reporters to support his earlier assertion, he became somewhat defiant.I wanted to bring awareness of that, but I dont think I should be labeled as just as a black quarterback because there are bigger things in this sport that need to be accomplished, he said.While the questioning was more confrontational than a typical pre-Super Bowl news conference, Newton stayed in good spirits and addressed criticism directed at him and his teammates for their on-field celebrations, pointing out that an average N.F.L. play lasts four to six seconds, and that people should pay more attention to those stretches of time than to celebrations.We have a lot of character and charisma and personality in the locker room, but the big picture everyone should be talking about is those four to six seconds, Newton said.LADY GAGAS ANTHEM Lady Gaga, a six-time Grammy award winner who recently won a Golden Globe for her role in American Horror Story: Hotel, will sing the national anthem at Super Bowl 50, the N.F.L. and CBS announced.Coldplay and several guests will perform during the halftime show.This particular Super Bowl, because its 50, is so different than any one that Ive been associated with and probably will be different than any one in the future, said Mark Quenzel, a senior vice president of NFL Network, which produces the pregame and halftime shows. MELISSA HOPPERTMESSAGE TO PANTHERS Before the Carolina Panthers went to California for the Super Bowl, the team broadcaster Eugene Robinson had a message for the players: Dont mess up the way I did.Robinson was a Falcons safety in January 1999 when he was arrested the night before the Super Bowl for solicitation of a prostitute, while his wife and children were in a nearby hotel. Robinson played in the Super Bowl the next day, but gave up an 80-yard touchdown pass and missed a tackle on a long run as Atlanta lost, 34-19, to the Denver Broncos.It was just to tell these guys, dont mess this up, Robinson said. He added, I can be a living example.Panthers Coach Ron Rivera said the speech seemed to resonate with players, who gave Robinson a standing ovation.I think it is one of the bravest things I have ever seen a guy do, Rivera said.Robinson remains married to his wife of 30 years. She has forgiven him for what occurred, but Robinson said it is something he will have to live with the rest of his life.Its easy to lose your way when youre selfish and youre only thinking about yourself, Robinson said. Thats what I did. (AP)"}

{"text": "In his new novel, The Fugitives, Christopher Sorrentino grafts a halfhearted, Elmore Leonard-style casino heist plot onto what is fundamentally the mournful story of one mans failures as a writer, a husband and a father. The result is something close to a disaster.The elements dont mesh, and what were left with is whats called, in the video game world, at least, a mutual kill: Each side is fatally damaged.The funny thing about The Fugitives, however, is that youd never mistake it for the work of an untalented writer. Mr. Sorrentino has serious gifts, and his observations about sex, envy, writers block, marriage and whats left of New York Citys literary world hint at the formidable novel this might have been. Theres a lot of gleaming machinery here that is never assembled  machinery a lesser writer wouldnt have around in the first place.The Fugitives is the story of Alexander Mulligan III, known as Sandy, a successful Brooklyn writer who escapes to small-town Michigan to try to finish a stalled novel. He is also escaping a domestic scandal involving an affair, a divorce, a pregnancy and a suicide.The sexual outlaw is now a sexual outcast. Youd think after Burroughs had put a bullet through his wifes head, after Mailer had stabbed his, the demented comedian in Sandy comments, Id catch a break. Instead, a persecuting spirit all but hounds him out of Brooklyn.Once in Michigan, he finds a house and sets up a literary war room. His novel is long overdue, so he lays in enough Office Depot goodies, of a luxury sort, to knock the thing out in a few months. Here we find him midappraisal: I also had an Aeron chair, a laptop with separate cordless keyboard and mouse, an external hard drive, a printer, a scanner/fax/copier, a smartphone, an iPod and a stereo dock, a modem, a high-speed Internet connection, and a wireless router to connect it all; everything the reclusive author needed except a briar pipe and a walking stick.What he lacks is his muse. His novel is not merely stalled; privately, hes given it up for dead. He fritters away his days, watching pornography, listening to playlists of thrillingly sad music and ingesting beers before lunch. His publisher is threatening to demand that he return his advance; hes living on a grant that may be cut off.Mr. Sorrentino is the author of five previous books, notably Trance (2005), a winding and Don DeLillo-ish novel that was a remixing of the events surrounding Patty Hearsts kidnapping. That book was a finalist for the National Book Award but didnt attract the audience it deserved. Trance had the misfortune of appearing in the wake of Susan Chois sublime 2003 novel, American Woman, also loosely about the Hearst case, which caught a larger ride in the culture.Mr. Sorrentinos new novel is, you cant help noticing, at least vaguely autobiographical. Like Sandy, he was involved in a painful divorce, so painful that a book  Benjamin Anastass memoir, Too Good to Be True (2012)  has been written by another party in the sorry mess. Sandys father, a college professor, somewhat resembles the authors own, the novelist Gilbert Sorrentino. Sandys novel is overdue; this is Mr. Sorrentinos first major book in more than a decade.Weve met men like Sandy a hundred times. The lightly grizzled midcareer novelist as a lout, fumbling toward grace, is among the oldest stories. But if its a tired story, so is boy meets girl and road trip. These narrative forms are elastic sacks into which fine spirits can still be poured.Mr. Sorrentino pours some very fine spirits indeed. For example, Sandy would despise my paragraph, just above, in which I suggest some similarities between author and hero. A novel should be like the calling card of an unknown killer, he writes  deadly and anonymous.The author has intuitive things to say about the online world. Facebook is regarded by Sandy as that nice smooth interface between you and all the bad habits and ancient disharmonies. He sends up the sort of book parties held in art galleries with high-res photos of vulvas on the walls.Yet Sandys story is not allowed to accrue layers of meaning and wit. Before long, he meets Kat, a plucky young reporter from a Chicago newspaper. Shes on the trail of a lowlife, nicknamed Jackie Crackers, who may or may not have stolen already skimmed money from an Indian casino.Jackie Crackers also may or may not have reinvented himself as a Native American storyteller who appears at local fairs and libraries. Trust me when I say: You will not care about Jackie Crackers.Kat and Sandy meet cute, have blazing sex (back in Chicago, she is married to a froglike food critic) and get into ridiculous scrapes involving tough guys and handguns and shallow graves out in the woods.The dialogue follows them right off the deep end. Over sandwiches and milkshakes, Sandy begins to make pronouncements like: It turned out Rilke was right, that fame is no more than the quintessence of all the misunderstandings collecting around a new name. Kats editor back in Chicago makes the same kind of pretentious sucking sounds.Gore Vidal had no patience with anyone who, like Sandy, complained of writers block. About such men and women, he said: Youre not meant to be doing this. Plenty more where you came from.But Mr. Sorrentino is clearly meant to be doing this  writing novels, that is. Even if, in The Fugitives, hes spinning his outsize wheels."}
{"text": "BEIJING  You must marry!Its a phrase many single Chinese are steeling themselves to hear from well-meaning but busybody relatives during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Sunday, when millions of Chinese will return home.So great is the social pressure to marry that the phrase bihun! (!), or must marry, is a meme here, a joke, even. Not marrying and producing offspring is considered unfilial and Chinese society traditionally views the unmarried as less than full adults. That places unbearable pressure on gay or transgender Chinese, many of whom may not have revealed their sexuality to their families, on people who have been unlucky in love and especially on young women, for whom the pressure to marry may begin as young as 20, the legal marrying age for women.Reflecting all that, bihun has given rise to a thriving matchmaking industry for singletons who may prefer to rent a partner for the holiday to deceive their relatives rather than face the badgering. It even provided the theme for a popular 24-part television series, Renting a Girlfriend to Go Home for New Year.This year, a group of like-minded friends decided to push back and paid for an ad extolling singlehood that went up on Thursday at the busy Dongzhimen subway station in Beijing, where it can be seen by millions over the month it will be there.Only one, though. At 38,000 renminbi, nearly $5,800, for a 3-by-4.5-foot ad, the group of about 10, who include students, artists and civil society workers who met via social media, cannot afford more, said Coby, 27, a nongovernmental worker who, fearing the impact on her private life if her Chinese name were published, asked to be identified only by her English name.Were just a few friends who got together before Spring Festival, as Lunar New Year is also called, and just thought, the pressure is too much. Its at its worst at this time. Its so big! Coby said in a telephone interview. So we thought wed put up an ad in the subway where a lot of people would see it.Making that happen involved submitting designs to an advertising company, which vetted them with the local branch of the Beijing Industry and Commerce Bureau.The company and the officials rejected an initial design that showed a defiant young woman with her hands crossed above her head in a no! gesture, the sun shining fiercely behind her, the characters for bihun crossed out on her T-shirt.No reason was given, said Xiong Jing, another member of the group.So we chose a gentler design, Coby said.Heres the final product:It reads:And this is followed by a hotline for singles: 010-64808179.The line is open Wednesdays and Fridays from noon to 7 p.m.Here is the original design the group submitted:The company and the officials said the word bi, which means force, compel or must, sounds the same as, you know, that bi,  Ms. Xiong said, referring to a part of the female anatomy that features in many vulgarities around the world.So, no bi.But Ms. Xiong said she was unsure why was it acceptable to use the word bi if the message favored marriage but unacceptable if it did not. Bihun, or must marry, is ubiquitous even in public and in advertising.The text, too, was watered down. One early version read:Other versions contained the lines: My life, Im in charge or Whats the rush to must marry?A woman answering the telephone at the Beijing Industry and Commerce Bureau said the bureau vets all outdoor advertising. If the content is in line with Chinas advertising law, officials usually will approve it, she said. She declined to give her name, saying she was unauthorized to speak to the news media.The ad is set to hang near a busy exit at Dongzhimen station until early March, after the holiday."}
{"text": "LONDON  LVMH, the worlds largest luxury group by sales, recorded full year profit and revenue for 2015 that outpaced analysts expectations, despite a rocky global market.Annual profit from recurring operations rose 16 percent last year to 6.6 billion euros, or $7.2 billion, LVMH, a French company, said Tuesday, a soaring earnings increase from its portfolio of over 70 brands including Louis Vuitton, Veuve Clicquot and Bulgari. Analysts predicted profit of 6.5 billion, according to an average of 27 estimates.Total sales were 35.7 billion ($38.8 billion) for 2015, a growth of 6 percent in organic terms compared with 2014  and more than twice the estimated 2 to 3 percent growth in the global luxury market as a whole.A strong performance in the United States, Europe and Japan offset weakness in China, where LVMH has recently shuttered stores, the company said in a statement after the Paris markets closed.Robust sales in the last three months of the year of 10.4 billion ($11.3 billion), up 5 percent on an organic basis, also topped analyst estimates of 3.9 percent.The 2015 results confirm the capacity for LVMH to progress and gain market share despite economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Revenue and operating profit reached new record levels, said Bernard Arnault, the companys chief executive.The global market for luxury personal goods in 2015 was heading for its weakest year since 2009, according to research conducted by Bain & Company, a management consulting agency, as a combination of volatile stock markets, a strong dollar, slowing economic growth in emerging markets and geopolitical turmoil hurt bottom lines.LVMH, which has weathered the storm better than rivals like the Italian fashion house Prada, pointed to an increase in revenue at its fashion and leather division, which accounts for the bulk of sales and profits.It said that it was now enjoying a positive impact from exchange rates, and that it was well-equipped to continue its growth momentum across all business groups in 2016.LVMH also mooted raising the dividend on 2015 results by 11 percent to 3.55 a share. The latest full-year results come three weeks after LVMH and Mr. Arnaults family holding company, Groupe Arnault, announced a partnership with Catterton, the United States private equity group, to start a consumer-focused investment firm seeking assets under management of $12 billion.The combined company, to be called L Catterton, will be 60 percent owned by the partners of the new firm, with the remainder held by LVMH and Groupe Arnault, and based in Greenwich, Conn."}

The documentary video shown at the beginning of her events is titled Fighter.And, now the tough fight ahead in the New Hampshire primary has become part of the Hillary Clinton campaigns central messaging.I come here well aware of the fact that political pundits have been opining, as political pundits do, that I should have just skipped coming to New Hampshire, said Mrs. Clinton, who trails Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by double digits in most polls in and around the state.She continued: Their argument is  and its got some strength to it, Look, youre behind here and youre in your opponents backyard. New Hampshire always favors neighbors, which I think is neighborly, and, you know, maybe you should have just moved on to other states where everybody says youve got big leads and all of that.I have to tell you, Mrs. Clinton told an intimate crowd at an event space at the Derry Boys & Girls Club. I just could not ever skip New Hampshire. I could not even imagine not being here, not being in settings like these.If Bill Clinton famously vowed at a New Hampshire town hall to stand up for struggling Americans till the last dog dies, his wife is keeping the dog on life support. She trailed Mr. Sanders by 19 percentage points in a Marist poll conducted Jan. 17 to Jan. 23, and her advisers have urged her to focus time and resources on Nevada, which holds its caucuses on Feb. 20.Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, told reporters that the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday was not about the margin but about who Hillary Clinton is.New Hampshire has delivered a helping hand to the Clintons in the past, including making Mr. Clinton the Comeback Kid after he emerged from scandal to place second in the 1992 primary.Mrs. Clinton pulled off a surprise victory against Barack Obama after finishing third in Iowa in 2008. This time, the odds are even tougher, campaign officials said.Its a different scenario this time around, Ms. Palmieri told reporters.In 2008, she added, we were not running against somebody who had been an elected official next door sharing a media market for 20 years, so we think this is different but shell work as hard as she can.On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton brought some of that fight to the town-hall-style event in Derry, criticizing Mr. Sanders for saying she was a progressive some days.It was kind of a low blow, Mrs. Clinton said, and proceeded to list the high points of her rsum. It was a good day for progressives when I helped get eight million kids health care, she said. I think it was a good day for progressives when I joined with colleagues in the Senate to help stop George W. Bush from privatizing Social Security. I think it was a good day for progressives when I went to Geneva and Beijing to stand up for gay rights and womens rights.I hope we can keep it on the issues, Mrs. Clinton said. Because if its about our records, hey, Im going to win by a landslide.But first, she has to fight."}
{"text": "The mystery of what will happen to Picassos 1931 plaster bust of his mistress and muse Marie-Thrse Walter after the Museum of Modern Arts blockbuster show closes on Sunday has been temporarily resolved.The two parties disputing the sculptures ownership  the dealer Larry Gagosian and a representative of the Qatar royal family  have agreed that the statue will go to the Gagosian Gallery until the conflict is adjudicated.The two groups both claim that they own the bust and that it was sold to them by the daughter of Picasso and Ms. Walter, Maya Widmaier-Picasso, 80. In a legal action filed last month in federal court in Manhattan against the Qatari familys agent, Pelham Holdings, Mr. Gagosian claimed that he bought the sculpture in May for about $106 million from Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, and then sold it to an undisclosed New York collector.But an agent for Pelham Holdings, which is managed by Guy Bennett, maintained in its own court documents that it had an agreement with Ms. Widmaier-Picasso to buy the work in November 2014 for 38 million euros, or about $42 million.The bust, featured in the MoMA show, is considered a major work.In the action filed last month against Pelham, the Gagosian Gallery asked a judge to quiet any challenges or claims to its title of the bust.Pelham said that it bought the bust on behalf of Sheik Jassim bin Abdulaziz al-Thani, who is married to Sheika al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, chairwoman of the Qatar Museums Authority. But right before the sale could be completed, a lawyer for Ms. Widmaier-Picasso asked, in April, that the sale to the royal family be canceled, Pelham said in court documents, because Widmaier-Picasso lacked mental capacity to agree to the transaction due to purported medical issues.Pelham sued Ms. Widmaier-Picasso to enforce the original sale and obtained a court order to prevent her from moving the sculpture, an injunction that has been challenged and is under appeal. (She has also countersued.) Pelham said it later learned that the disputed bust was in the MoMA show, on loan from a private collection, courtesy of Gagosian Gallery.Mr. Gagosian maintains that the title passed to him after his third payment to Ms. Widmaier-Picasso.Mr. Gagosian would hold the sculpture, but if for any reason he wanted to move the work, he would have to notify the other side first."}
{"text": "Kristaps Porzingis was honored Tuesday afternoon as the Eastern Conferences rookie of the month for the third straight time. A few hours later, the Celtics, unimpressed by his growing list of credentials, battered and bruised Porzingis and the Knicks, 97-89, at Madison Square Garden, dropping the Knicks (23-28) to five games below .500 for the first time this season.Porzingiss monthly rookie awards are beginning to appear as if they are more a result of a thin competition than outstanding performance. He won Januarys honor despite poor shooting in recent weeks, and with his team mired in a slump, having lost six of seven games.Coach Derek Fisher indicated before the game that the Knicks surprising foray into the playoff race might have caused his players focus to deviate.Its hard to walk around the city, Im sure, for the guys, and theyre getting crowned as though were doing a lot, when we still have a long way to go, Fisher said.One of the last times the Knicks had reason to hold their chests out was three weeks ago, when they beat the Celtics. Led by Porzingiss 26 points, the Knicks won for the fifth time in six games and were tied with Boston for the eighth playoff spot.Since then, the teams trajectories have diverged. The Celtics had gone 8-3 after that loss on Jan. 12, climbing into a tie for the fifth playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls, while the Knicks were tied for 10th and a half-game from falling into 12th place entering Tuesdays game.I think in recent weeks, as the noise has picked up about what we might be able to do three, four months from now, weve had some slippage, honestly, in terms of just focusing on just one day at a time and playing the game thats in front of us, Fisher said.Porzingis, in particular, has struggled. In each of his last seven games, he has been held to five field goals or fewer.In the first half, he continued to misfire. Porzingis made one field goal and scored 4 points.Second-chance opportunities that Robin Lopez (nine offensive rebounds) created helped to offset a lack of ball movement by the Knicks. With Jose Calderon missing his fourth straight game with a sore right groin, the Knicks had only six assists but led, 47-45, after a sloppy first half in which the Celtics missed all 13 of their 3-point attempts.But instead of grabbing control of the game, the Knicks continued to fumble opportunities, while the Celtics hounded Porzingis with a combination of frontcourt players.The third quarter was best represented by a stretch during the ninth minute of play. Tied, 62-62, the teams combined for five turnovers in less than 40 seconds, kicking around the loose ball like figures on a foosball table.There wasnt very much that worked tonight in terms of combination of guys that could sustain anything on both ends, other than maybe the first couple minutes of the game, Fisher said.Boston finally pulled away early in the fourth, led by Kelly Olynyk, who scored 11 points in the quarter, while the Knicks could not create a go-to option down the stretch.Carmelo Anthony finished with 16 points, shooting 4 for 16 from the field, and Porzingis scored 10 on 4 of 11 attempts.The Celtics also outscored the Knicks in the lane, 58 to 28.Such glaring discrepancies have begun to catch the attention of the Knicks, who can no longer rest on the success of their unexpected start.I think there is a little sense of urgency to know that we have got to turn this thing around quickly, Anthony said, because it can start going downhill, and we dont want that."}
{"text": "BAKERSFIELD, Calif.  Along the Maricopa Highway at the southwestern end of the San Joaquin Valley, rimmed by hardscrabble hills and bobbing oil pumps, stretch miles of lush green groves bearing fluorescent mandarin oranges. Once home to cotton fields, this is now the epicenter of an epic agricultural boom that has industrialized a noble fruit and turned it into a rising star.Since that expansion started in the late 1990s, Californias mandarin plantings have increased 10-fold, to 50,000 acres from 5,000. The state now harvests 92 percent of the nations mandarin crop, while Florida, troubled by citrus greening disease and obsolete varieties with seeds, has had its share drop to 8 percent, from 66 percent.In the process, thanks to new offerings and deft marketing, mandarins  popularly known as tangerines  have become a fixture in the American fruit bowl. The countrys consumption of mandarins has doubled, to five pounds a year for every American, while orange sales have declined.Mandarins may seem an unlikely candidate for a marquee fruit. The most complex and flavorful of citrus, they are correspondingly difficult to grow, as demanding as wine grapes in their requirements for terroir and horticultural prowess. At their finest, they are juicy, sweet-tart and intensely aromatic, but many store-bought specimens are dry and bland. Shippers and merchants often store them far past their peak, and the seeds in traditional varieties can put off consumers.To get the best of the mandarin boom, it helps to understand the fruits history, varieties and seasons.Native to China and northeastern India, mandarins are one of five original types of citrus (along with pummelos, citrons, kumquats and papedas) from which all others, like oranges and grapefruit, are derived. Until recently, because most mandarins were relatively small, delicate or full of seeds, they remained less cultivated than other citrus in the United States.Several forces converged to ignite the California mandarin boom. Consumers increasingly demanded convenient, easy-to-eat fruits like blueberries and seedless grapes. In the 1970s, Spain started exporting clementines  seedless and easy to peel, with excellent flavor  to the Eastern United States, and that trade increased significantly after a devastating California citrus freeze in 1990.Two varieties of seedless, easy-peeling mandarins, adapted to mechanized packing, became available to California growers, and horticulturists figured out how to grow seedless clementines, a type of mandarin, in the harsh climate of the San Joaquin Valley.In the late 1990s, two companies with deep pockets and marketing savvy, Sun Pacific and Paramount Citrus (now Wonderful Citrus), gambled big with huge mandarin plantings on the Maricopa Highway, 25 miles southwest of Bakersfield, where they were isolated from other citrus whose pollen could make the fruit seedy.It was a crapshoot, recalled Berne Evans, the plain-spoken owner of Sun Pacific, during an interview in his office in Pasadena.The bet paid off spectacularly. Mandarins from the two companies, sold as Cuties and Halos, now dominate the American market; these and a few other brands of reasonably priced, seedless and easy-peeling fruit have become a staple.As often happens, however, industrialization has exacted compromises. There are two main types of mandarin in Cuties and Halos boxes, and the earlier of these to ripen  yellow-orange clementines marketed from November to mid-January  requires a more Mediterranean climate to produce the juiciest, most flavorful fruit. The chief clementine variety grown in California, Clemenules, is larger but less sublime than the original varieties, Algerian and Fina.To a greater extent than for other citrus, commercial packing can distort the flavor of many mandarins, including clementines. The washing needed for food safety strips the natural wax off fruits, and to keep them from drying out, packers apply artificial wax. This stops natural respiration, leading to the production of fermented and musty flavors, which are aggravated by prolonged storage and unrefrigerated conditions. The only recourse for shoppers is to taste or at least sniff a sample before buying.Fortunately for consumers, the other main type of mandarins in Halos and Cuties boxes, from late January through April, is better adapted to the San Joaquin Valley climate and less susceptible to post-harvest degradation. These are actually two similar varieties: W. Murcott Afourer, a seedling of Murcott (best known as the Florida Honey tangerine), found in Morocco in 1982, and Tango, bred from W. Murcott Afourer to be seedless even when pollinated.Attractively deep orange inside and out, dependably juicy, easy to grow and wildly prolific, these robust prodigies rule the market in their season.The supremacy of the two big companies and two mandarin types has forced medium and smaller growers to think outside the Cuties and Halos box  to exploit seasonal and regional niches, and to market distinctive premium varieties.Many of these growers are in the traditional citrus belt in the eastern San Joaquin Valley, from Bakersfield to Fresno, where the red soil imparts robust flavor. Some have focused on offerings that ripen in late December and January, when the main commercial varieties are not at their best.The fine acid balance and rich aromatics of one variety, Page, have made it a longtime favorite at California farmers markets, but until recently, large growers neglected it because it doesnt peel very readily, and looks more like a small, round orange than a mandarin. Since it fills the December-to-January gap, and produces and ships well, it has been planted on more than 1,000 acres in the last five years and become widely available for the first time.One of the best-tasting mandarins in the world, Daisy SL, has a gorgeously smooth, red-orange rind, firm, intensely sweet-tart flesh that melts in the mouth, and complex, lingering aromatics. Alas, plantings have been limited because it is only moderately easy to peel, low in seeds rather than seedless, and genetically unstable, so that some trees have reverted to seedy form. In todays market, fruit with seeds have little value.Its not a matter of price, Mr. Evans said. People dont want them.The prized Dekopon mandarin of Japan, grown and marketed in this country as Sumo from mid-January to March, has cornered the high-price niche since its introduction in 2011. Huge, with pebbly skin and a distinctive bump at the top, very easy to peel and seedless, it is intensely sweet but balanced by refreshing acidity, a blend of power and finesse.Despite its rugged appearance, it takes extreme care to grow and pick, so it costs $4 to $7 a pound, as much as a whole box of common mandarins. To ensure that the quality matches the price, the packer recently installed near-infrared spectroscopy sensors that measure sweetness and acidity. Many stores sell Sumos, including Whole Foods nationwide, Wegmans in the Middle Atlantic States, Central Market in Texas, and Town & Country in Washington State.A new type of hybrid mandarin with red flesh like a blood orange, marketed as Ruby Tango, is large and mostly orange on the outside, peels fairly easily, and is sweet, juicy and seedless. A cross of blood orange and clementine bred in Sicily, grown primarily by Sunwest Fruit, it will be sold on a significant scale for the first time this year starting around Valentines Day by retailers like Fairway Market and FreshDirect in the New York area and some Whole Foods stores in California.The cutest, most child-friendly mandarin is the Seedless Kishu, an ancient Japanese specialty the size of a golf ball, very easy to peel, super sweet, with welcome acidity. It is so small, expensive to pick and perishable that it seems utterly uncommercial, but two sophisticated specialty growers in Orange Cove have planted 20 acres, some on trellises like wine grapes. There, its season is December, but the crop from the original California growers, Churchill Orchard of Ojai, starts ripening in mid-January and will be available at select stores nationwide (including the Orchard in Midwood, Brooklyn) for about the next 10 days.Ojai, 40 miles south at the other end of the Maricopa Highway from the big commercial plantings, across a rugged mountain range in a coastal valley, is the domain of small artisanal growers. The areas fierce summer heat sweetens the fruit, and a wide daily fluctuation in temperature preserves acidity and develops aromatics. But even within this Napa Valley of mandarins, there is considerable variation.The presence or absence of acidity in the same variety, sometimes grown a block apart, is one of the great mysteries of mandarins, said Lisa Brenneis, an owner of Churchill Orchard. Sweet is one thing, but if you dont have the acidity with it, it doesnt haunt you.Ojai growers specialize in Pixie, a late-season, naturally low-acid, seedless and easy-to-peel fruit that reaches an ideal balance only there. Because the variety is highly susceptible to developing off-flavors from waxing, Ojai Pixies are dry-brushed clean rather than waxed. They are available from March to May at many stores around the country.Tony Thacher of Friends Ranches, whose family has grown mandarins in Ojai since the 1920s, ships unwaxed fruit by mail order, including supreme specimens of Daisy SL, in season now. Some of the six varieties, packed by his daughter, Emily Ayala, have seeds, and they are not cheap  about $60 to $75 for 10 pounds, including shipping. But they offer a rare opportunity to taste the most flavorful mandarins from a prime growing area, as fresh as possible.The commercial mandarin season closes with Gold Nugget, a half brother of Pixie harvested from February to April or May. It is seedless and has excellent sweet flavor, with good acidity, but the rind is rough, with abundant oil that makes it difficult to pick and pack, and comes off on the hands when peeled. Many growers are planting it anyway, believing that its season and flavor outweigh these drawbacks.As for the future, the mandarin boom may be peaking. Most major growers feel that the market is getting saturated, and that California plantings will soon stabilize. But whatever happens, mandarins have arrived, and now is the time to try them.Here is a guide to some of the mandarin varieties available."}
{"text": "Taking a daily low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk for heart attack and stroke, and possibly the risk for certain cancers. Now researchers have found another possible benefit: protection against dying from a Staphylococcus aureus blood infection.Swiss scientists followed 838 cases of S. aureus infection from 2001 through 2013. From the group, they selected 157 who were taking aspirin and matched them with 157 controls, similar in age, severity of infection, treatments undergone and various other health and behavioral characteristics, but who were not taking low-dose aspirin. The study is in Critical Care Medicine.At the end of 30 days, 27.4 percent of the controls had died, but only 12.1 percent of those on aspirin had died. After controlling for other factors, taking low-dose aspirin (usually sold in doses of 81 milligrams) was associated with a 42 percent lower risk of death.The authors did a similar analysis with 134 aspirin users with E. coli infection and 134 controls, but found no effect of aspirin on infection with that germ.This is a retrospective study that finds an association, not causality, said the lead author, Dr. Michael Osthoff, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Basel. There may still be factors we havent controlled for. Its too early to tell everyone with S. aureus infection to take aspirin. There are downsides to taking aspirin, too."}
{"text": "The Cleveland Browns issued a terse response on Tuesday to quarterback Johnny Manziels latest incident, with a strong implication that his days as a Brown may be numbered.Weve been clear about expectations for our players on and off the field, Sashi Brown, the teams executive vice president for football operations, said. Johnnys continual involvement in incidents that run counter to those expectations undermines the hard work of his teammates and the reputation of our organization. His status with our team will be addressed when permitted by league rules. We will have no further comment at this time.The Browns would be able to release Manziel on Feb. 8, the day after the Super Bowl. The new N.F.L. year starts March 9, and ESPN reported that for salary cap reasons, it would be advantageous for the Browns to wait until then to dismiss Manziel.The latest incident occurred over the weekend, when the police in Fort Worth hunted for Manziel after a woman describing herself as his ex-girlfriend said they had been involved in a disturbance. The police wound up using a helicopter before finding Manziel safe. No arrests have been made.In October, near Cleveland, Manziel was spotted fighting with a woman as they drove. She later told the police that he had hit her and pushed her head against the window, but he was cleared by N.F.L. investigators. He admitted having drunk alcohol earlier in the day. Manziel spent two months in a rehab facility for undisclosed reasons last winter.His two years in the N.F.L. have included numerous incidents of exuberant partying captured on video, including an apparent ride on an inflated swan while drinking from a bottle of Champagne.Manziel was drafted No. 22 over all out of Texas A&M, where he had won the Heisman Trophy as a freshman. Despite his notoriety, his playing time in the N.F.L. has been limited. The backup to Brian Hoyer in his rookie season, he started twice. This season, he was the backup to Josh McCown, and started six games. His career record is 2-6."}
{"text": "Rand Paul went quickly from one race to another on Wednesday as both parties zeroed in on his Senate re-election bid almost as soon as he had quit the Republican presidential primary campaign.The National Republican Senatorial Committee fired out a statement noting that the Kentucky Republicans commitment to fighting for Kentucky families remains unchanged. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took a slightly different line, saying that Mr. Paul returns home damaged and completely out of touch with the people hes ignored. The Democratic National Committee took a whack at him as well.At the same time, the conservative groups FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth renewed their support for Mr. Paul in his Senate re-election attempt, which has gotten more complicated with the entry of Jim Gray, the Democratic mayor of Lexington.Mr. Paul, who tried to keep up his Senate attendance record while campaigning, no doubt has some repair work to do at home. His interest in the White House after less than one term in the Senate will make it easy for opponents to portray him as not being devoted to Kentucky and seeing his Senate seat mainly as a steppingstone. His relatively poor performance in the White House race could turn off voters as well.Mr. Gray, in his own statement on Mr. Pauls dashed presidential hopes, hit on those points. Now that hes failed to catch fire with voters in other states, hes coming back, Mr. Gray said in the statement. Well, we deserve to be more than just a fallback plan.However, Kentucky has become increasingly Republican and strongly resistant to Democrats during the Obama years. Senator Mitch McConnell, Mr. Pauls fellow Republican and the Senate leader, has hit the administration incessantly for its war on coal  still a major industry in Kentucky. Republicans will be very determined in their efforts to tie Mr. Gray, or whoever the Democratic nominee is, to Mr. Obama and his partys policies.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "The gentleman in the vintage Japanese noragi work shirt and unstructured pinstriped suit, the one likely to be ringed with Mongolian prayer beads, is attracting attention, again.Walk beside him on the way out of one of the many fashion shows he attends and you can expect to be blinded by camera flashes. Though he is somewhat bashful about it, he is a hero to many of those who follow mens wear. There is even a Pinterest board in his honor: Gods of Menswear 4: Josh Peskowitz.Those looking to make themselves in their gods image will soon have a place to do so. Mr. Peskowitz, 36, who has spent the last several years as the mens fashion director of Bloomingdales, is striking out on his own.In March, he and two partners  Christophe Desmaison and Simon Golby, of the fashion showroom CD Network  will open their own mens store, Magasin, in Culver City, Calif. So Mr. Peskowitz took in the mens wear shows in Europe in January and in New York this week with a new goal: to stock his shop without deference to anyones opinion but his own.Im putting myself on the line, he said. This is me.Magasin will be part of Platform, a new hub of shops, restaurants and offices a stones throw from Beverly Hills. (Were kind of allergic to the word mall, said Joseph Miller, one of its developers.) Though Mr. Peskowitz is a native New Yorker  born in Brooklyn, though raised in part in Washington, D.C.  and a regular on Most Stylish New Yorkers lists, the opportunity was too good to resist.When it opens, Magasin (French for store, and a near-cognate with magazine, a confusion Mr. Peskowitz said he enjoyed) will carry mostly small-bore Japanese and Italian labels: Ts(s), Engineered Garments and Camoshita from Japan and Massimo Alba and Salvatore Piccolo from Italy, along with shoes by OKeeffe and Feit. More to the point, all the brands will be styled and stocked together, rather than cordoned off by individual label.Mr. Peskowitzs style is all about an unlikely but considered mix  things that are tailored and things that are more vintage-looking, things that are hippie-dippie-looking and things that are more elegant, he said  bred of magpie experience.Before Bloomingdales, Mr. Peskowitz tried his hand at e-commerce with Gilt Groupe; before that, as a fashion editor at magazines as unalike as The Fader, Vibe and Esquire. (Disclosure: Mr. Peskowitz and I worked together at Men.Style.com, a website owned by Cond Nast that has since been shuttered.)Theres a reason hes so popular among street-style photographers, said Will Welch, the newly named editor of GQ Style, who has known Mr. Peskowitz since they began their careers at The Fader more than a decade ago. He really tries new ideas, both in the various jobs hes had and on his actual person, the way he gets dressed.Mr. Peskowitz offered his own distillation of his new idea: Its clothes for grown-up weirdos, he said of the vision for the store. Or grown-up clothes for weirdos?Weirdo style tends to proliferate in the pages of magazines, where stylists (like Mr. Peskowitz was) can focus on creating a look or a mood in a photograph, free from commercial constraints or the constrictions of reality.Translating those visions into actual sales is the job of retailers, and one reason the most esoteric pieces seen on fashion-week runways and magazine photo shoots often dont find their way to store shelves. Grown-up ones do.Mr. Peskowitz has been on both sides of this divide. He believes that men still need to wear tailored jackets (even in perma-casual Los Angeles) but also that they are brave enough to venture beyond the black-and-navy palette that stores often stock.Theres room to expand the horizons, he said. Im not talking about going Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat, although we did buy a couple of those."}

It is almost completely empty of life.The images evoke scenes from a post-apocalyptic video game  an abandoned graveyard, a lone motorcyclist, gutted buildings reduced to pile after pile of rubble  and help explain the desperation driving the countrys spasms of civilian flight.In 2014, The Timess Beirut bureau chief, Anne Barnard, traveled to Syria and  reported via Twitter on the lives ravaged by the violence. Syrias civil war has left about a quarter-million people dead, while it has displaced millions more and ensnared many of the worlds powers.A renewed effort by the United Nations to bring the countrys warring sides together for peace talks got off to a rocky start this week.

{"text": "FROM the reusable rockets by SpaceX to the stunning photos of dim and distant Pluto, space is all over the news. While becoming an astronaut is out of reach for most of us, there are plenty of apps that can take your mind on a journey to the final frontier.Start with the official NASA app, which is easy to navigate and is free on iOS and Android, and for Amazon Fire devices. The app features photos and videos, news about current missions, NASA tweets and more.Using your location on Earth, the app can even calculate when youll next be able to spot the International Space Station. My favorite feature is the live video feed from the station itself: Theres something humbling and uplifting about seeing our planet from that vantage point in real time.The NASA app is educational, and its both fun and enlightening to browse through the news and recent images from NASAs many missions.Although the app is inherently technology-focused, the interface and controls seem slightly old-fashioned. Still, exploring the NASA app is more likely to enrich your brain than playing a round of Angry Birds Space.Space Images (free on iOS and Android) offers a different way to learn about space. Coming from NASAs famed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, this app catalogs recent images of planets, moons, asteroids and other features of the cosmos, captured by NASA-affiliated space programs.The app has easy-to-use, icon-based navigation, and you can sort by either the top-rated images or the latest photos from NASA, like those still arriving from the Dawn spacecrafts mission to the dwarf planet Ceres. You can zoom in to explore the images in greater detail, and explanations about the photos are available with just a tap or two.This app is science-forward, meaning it requires some concentration. It wont appeal to everyone, and children using the app may need an adult to explain some of the material.While the NASA apps offer interesting photos of our planet snapped from space, for a truly 21st-century space image experience check out EO Science 2.0 AR from the European Space Agency (free on iOS and Android). To use it, you first print out a special image and lay it on a surface in front of you. Then you launch the app, click start and point your smartphones camera at the printout.The app then shows you a 3-D augmented reality image of Earth spinning over the printout. You can move your phone to look around or zoom in on the image. Tapping on Earth changes the image to show different maps incorporating data obtained from space, including height and depth, land cover, and ocean chlorophyll concentrations.EO Science 2.0 AR wont keep you occupied for long: While its visually attractive, it doesnt contain much real science or explanation  youll have to search online for that information to better understand the maps. But the app is a lot of fun and will excite younger users.For a completely different way to keep up with the latest news from orbit, take a look at Space, Astronomy and NASA News from Newsfusion, which is free on iOS and Android. The app aggregates news stories from a long list of online sources and covers NASA and European Space Agency news as well as breakthroughs in space science. Its interface has big, bold images and uses simple taps and swipes to navigate. You can even choose filters to see only the space news thats relevant to your interests.And remember that winter nights can be perfect for exploring space using nothing more than your own eyes, if the weather is cooperative and skies are clear. To help you understand what youre seeing up there, check out my new favorite astronomy app: Night Sky.Billing itself as your own personal planetarium, Night Sky acts like a virtual reality guide to what you can see in the sky above you: When you hold your phone up it shows a view of the stars as seen from your location. It also contains news about coming stargazing events.The apps detailed weather forecasting section predicts naked-eye star viewing conditions for the week ahead. And if you pay to upgrade to the pro version, the app offers even more features, including very detailed information about galaxies, planets, constellations, stars and satellites, all displayed in an attractive, image-heavy interface. Night Sky Lite is free on iOS and Android, but is limited in its features. The more complete versions cost $1 and up.Have fun traveling to infinity and beyond from the comfort of your armchair.Quick CallMicrosoft has a new, free iOS app intended to deliver news thats relevant to your professional interests. The app, News Pro, connects to your LinkedIn and Facebook pages to learn about your work, then chooses news stories for you from various online sources.

{"text": "When Bernie Sanders won election as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in 1981, I called his office to see if there was a story there about a socialist elected official. I was interning at The Washington Post (I didnt mention the intern part!) and spoke at length to some assistant who answered the phone in the mayors office.I asked about Sanderss plans, and the aide kept answering with we  which I thought a nice glimpse of contagious office socialism. After half an hour, I had enough to check with my editor, so I asked the aides name. Oh, he said a bit sheepishly, actually, Im Bernie Sanders.Sanderss lack of political airs has helped catapult him forward in the presidential race, overcoming a 50-point deficit to just about tie Hillary Clinton in Iowa. He comes across as winningly uncalculated: Other candidates kiss babies; Sanders seems to fumble for a babys off switch so he can tell you more about inequality in America. Most politicos sweet-talk voters; he bellows at them.I admire Sanderss passion, his relentless focus on inequality and his consistency. When he was sworn in as mayor of Burlington, he declared: The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the millions of families in the middle are gradually sliding out of the middle class and into poverty. That has remained his mantra across 35 years. And yet, I still have two fundamental questions for Sanders:Can you translate your bold vision into reality?On that, frankly, Im skeptical. Im for Medicare for All, but it wont happen. And if it did, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group, found that Sanderss sums come up short by $3 trillion over a decade.Likewise, Sanders says he would prod Americas allies in the Middle East to lead the charge to defeat the Islamic State. Yes, but how? The United States has already been trying unsuccessfully to get these allies to do more against ISIS. What new leverage does he bring?The Washington Post last month published a scathing editorial headlined Bernie Sanderss Fiction-Filled Campaign. It derided his fantastical claims and added: Sanders is not a brave truth-teller. He is a politician selling his own brand of fiction.I think thats too harsh, for Sanders panders less than other politicians (a very low bar), and he has often staked out lonely positions that turned out to be correctsuch as his opposition to the Iraq war. But there remains this open question of how he could achieve his ambitious agenda.I also wonder if his age may be relevant here: Sanders would be 75 when he took office, by far the oldest person to become president (Reagan was 69; Clinton would be a slightly younger 69). Sanders now is indefatigable, but people often slow down in their late 70s and their 80s.Another reason for skepticism is his congressional record. In 25 years in Congress, Sanders has been primary sponsor of just three bills that became law, and two were simply to rename post offices in Vermont; he did better with amendments. Clinton wasnt particularly effective as a legislator, either, but to me Sanderss record suggests that his strength is as a passionate advocate, not as a deal-maker who gets results.Can you get elected? Or would your nomination make a President Cruz more likely?When voters are polled today about how they would vote in a general election, Sanders does pretty well. For example, he beats Ted Cruz in the RealClearPolitics average, while Clinton loses to Cruz. But at this stage thats almost meaningless: Republicans are blasting Clinton while ignoring Sanders. If he were the nominee, he would be savaged.One particularly sobering item for Sanders supporters: A Gallup poll last year asking voters what kind of person they would be unwilling to consider voting for. Six percent of Americans say they wouldnt vote for a Catholic, and 7 percent wouldnt support a black or a Jew. Some 24 percent wouldnt vote for a gay candidate, and more than a third would refuse to vote for a Muslim or an atheist.However, the most objectionable kind of person by far was a socialist. Fifty percent of Americans said they would be unwilling to consider voting for a socialist.Maybe Sanders could convince them that a democratic socialist isnt exactly a socialist, or maybe he could charm some voters into rethinking their beliefs. He has done just that very successfully in Vermont, a state where he now wins elections by overwhelming margins, and skeptics have been underestimating him for 35 years. But if a Democratic nominee starts off with half the voters unwilling to consider someone like him, thats a huge advantage for the Republican nominee.So can he accomplish his goals, and is he electable? Lots of us admire Sanders and we would like reassurance."}
{"text": "As it turns out, fighting zombies does nothing to improve on the original Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austens heroine from Pride and Prejudice. In Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, a character claiming to be Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James), wields swords and other deadly blades, fires guns and occasionally flashes a leg in order to stomp on a zombie head. Battling the undead keeps her, friends and family safe from the flesh-eating hordes, but the character has been so radically transformed from Austens that Elizabeth already feels like a goner.The movie is adapted from the 2009 novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, who hit commercial pay dirt with a catchy title and the fusion of two ludicrously opposed, nominally irreconcilable cultural touchstones: Austen and zombies. With tongue in cheek and a copy of Austens novel of manners apparently by his side, Mr. Grahame-Smith added a zombie apocalypse to the Bennet family concerns, peppering the chatter about balls, romantic prospects and the uncertain future of its five unmarried daughters with asides about human brains scooped out like pumpkin seeds from a jack o lantern. Mr. Darcy is as proud and disagreeable as ever, but like Elizabeth, hes also a warrior.In Austens novel, the mutually hostile Elizabeth and Darcy are already combatants of a kind whose primary weapons are their witty, wounding, deeply meaningful words. In the movie, Elizabeth and Darcy (Sam Riley, a persuasively brooding presence), sling metaphoric arrows at each other now and again, but theyre so busy fighting the zombies overrunning the country that their actions invariably drown out everything else. Both pride and prejudice still play their parts, but now in service to one tediously repeated joke: the sight of a gentleman or a lady, together or alone, playing cards or ballroom dancing, fatally swarmed by devouring zombies.The writer-director Burr Steers came prepared for battle, if not much else, with appealing actors  Charles Dance, Jack Huston and an amusing Lena Headey  as well as handsome drawing rooms and impressive estates. But as one zombie brain after another is pulverized, and as Elizabeth and her crew slip through another close call, the storys lone joke and its grinding literalness grow dull. It doesnt help that Mr. Steers, as his occasional leering peeks up Elizabeths skirts underscore, clings to some old-fashioned ideas about women and their on-screen uses. The larger problem, though, is that each moment spent on this movie is another spent away from Austens novel.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

{"text": "To the Editor:Re El Salvadors Advice on Zika: Dont Have Babies (front page, Jan. 26):As of this writing, more than 20 countries in the Americas have reported the presence of the mosquito-borne Zika virus. An association between Zika, microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr syndrome was found by Brazilian researchers and has been verified by the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization.The transmission of the Zika virus will be similar to that of the chikungunya virus, with a high infection rate the first year and a lower risk in the second year. In six months or so, microcephaly will occur in children conceived by mothers infected by Zika.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning calling for pregnant women to postpone travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is continuing, along with other recommendations. These facts led the Salvadoran government to recommend that couples plan or postpone pregnancy for at least two years.The Salvadoran government has put in place measures for vector control, including water treatment, the use of window screens, and fogging and area sprays. Biological control mechanisms include mosquito-eating fish in home water tanks. These have been successful, building on the premise that the central effort should be to mobilize the whole society against the Zika-carrying mosquito.EDUARDO ESPINOZAVice Minister for HealthSan Salvador"}
{"text": "FRIDAY PUZZLE  This one by MaryLou Guizzo, in my opinion, was a great puzzle painted in sparkling, broad brushstrokes. It kept me guessing, it sometimes zigged when I zagged, but I had a fabulous time solving it. On a Friday, you could say, we are the sleuths and it is our job to connect the DOTS.First of all, I was wowed by the grid design, which constrained Ms. Guizzo into finding six 15-letter entries that interlocked, as well as the two 10s, CANNERY ROW and TAKEN ABACK. Whats more, theyre all very lively.I loved seeing SHAILENE WOODLEY and JESSICA CHASTAIN in the puzzle, for pretty much the same reason Ms. Guizzo outlines below, as well as the literary entries A MODEST PROPOSAL and CANNERY ROW. GO AT A SNAILS PACE is lively and in-the-language, as is WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I had WHAT MORE CAN WE DO at first, but the former makes more sense.In shorter entry news, I had FELIX before UNGER, which messed me up for a while in the northeast, but it was quickly remedied when I realized that the entry began with U for UNSTOPS and ended with R for RISK. I also didnt know SONDE, a French term, but its Friday and learning new things is part of the price of entry, isnt it?There is some nice wordplay in todays clues as well. I liked Dance that might give you a lift? for HORA, Reed section? for MARSH and They join teams for YOKES.Lets hear from Ms. Guizzo:I was pleased to work two strong women, SHAILENE WOODLEY and JESSICA CHASTAIN, who have triumphed over early difficulties to success, into the grid.

I discovered her puzzles in some older issues of New York Magazine at the library and found them quite addicting.)I appreciate the concise feedback I received from Will and Joel on the earlier versions of this puzzle as well as their acceptance and editing of this final version. Im still working on clever cluing. I appreciate their clues: A dance that might give you a lift? (HORA), Setting for fans (GRANDSTAND SEATS), They might work at a revival (EMTS) and Doctor seen by millions (PHIL).I hope you enjoyed your Friday solving experience.Nicely done, Ms. Guizzo.

{"text": "The Challenge: A healthy 67-year-old man develops an annoying little cough that, over the course of a week, worsens and nearly takes his breath away. Can you figure out why?Every month, the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine challenges Well readers with a real-life diagnostic question. In this case, a retired Air Force officer shows up in an emergency room with chest pain so severe he can barely breathe.I will provide you with the history, data and imaging available to the doctor who made the diagnosis. Its up to you to make it all make sense.The first person to identify the cause for these symptoms will win a copy of my book, Every Patient Tells a Story.The Patients StoryI think youre dying, the anxious wife told her husband of 38 years. Her 67-year-old spouse sat propped up at the head of the bed. His chin rested on his chest and his face bobbed up and down with each rapid fire breath. He gazed up at her from beneath his shaggy gray eyebrows.Im going  to be  O.K., he panted in a whisper.She didnt think so, and she wasnt alone. She had just spoken to one of his oldest friends, and he was worried too, she told her husband. The friend thought they should go to the hospital.Now? the man breathed.She nodded. He finally nodded in return. He would go.A Knife in the BackIt all happened so fast. An annoying little tickle that started maybe a week before was now a great wracking cough. Every breath felt like a knife cutting through to his back. The pain was so severe he couldnt take a deep breath, and he felt like there was so much stuff in his lungs that the little breaths he could take didnt bring in enough air.As he sat on his bed struggling to breathe, he suddenly flashed back to a morning many years ago when, as a small child, hed fallen into the deep end of the pool. He sank to the bottom, arms and legs flailing, the need for breath overwhelming. Suddenly he saw an explosion of bubbles, then felt strong hands lift him up, back into the air. Back where he could breathe.Now more than 60 years later he felt like he was struggling the same way. This time without the water, but still in need of rescue.The 30-mile drive from their home to Huntsville Hospital in Huntsville, Ala., was mostly on the interstate, but every tiny bump or dip brought a soft grunt of pain. The man held onto the strap above the window, willing himself motionless.His wife walked him into the emergency room, then hurried to park the car. By the time she got back he was already in a bed and, with oxygen piped into his nose, a little more comfortable.Downhill at the Fishing CampDr. Robert Centor, the attending physician on call at the hospital, had heard about the patient the night before and was eager to see him the next morning on rounds.Hed started off with a little nothing of a cough, the man told Dr. Centor. He mentioned it to his own doctor just before he went out to his fishing camp with some pals. After listening to his lungs, his doctor had pronounced him just fine.But the cough kept getting worse, going from occasional to constant practically overnight. He couldnt read or eat or sleep. Lying down made it even harder to breathe, so he spent two nights in a recliner. And the friends whod come to the camp with him got absolutely no sleep because of his persistent hacking.The third day of their trip, his chest began to hurt. Every breath felt like a dagger. Moving made it worse. So did breathing. He got out of breath just walking to the kitchen. His friends were worried. And, finally, so was he.As soon has he got home his wife took him to the local emergency room. A chest X-ray showed cloudy white patches over both lungs. He had no fever nor any sign of infection, and so the E.R. doctor figured it was probably his heart. The patient could stay in the hospital and see his doctor there or go home and see her in her office the next day.It was an easy decision: Hed much rather go home. The E.R. doctor admonished the patient to see his doctor as soon as he could and let him leave.A Problem Heart?The patient saw his doctor a couple of days later, and a brief exam convinced her that the E.R. doctor was right: It probably was his heart. It was hard to imagine any other reason for there to be clouds all over both of his lungs. Not too many things could do that. You could see it with a whopping pneumonia  but he had no fever or other signs of infection. Or you could see it with something known as congestive heart failure, which is what the emergency room doc thought he had.Congestive heart failure reflects a problem not with the lungs but with the muscle of the heart, the doctor explained. It gets injured somehow  maybe because of a heart attack or infection  and suddenly it cant beat as strongly as it had. Fluid from the blood, which should have been pumped out into the body, was instead backing up into his lungs.She sent him home on a powerful diuretic to help draw the water out of his chest and arranged for him to have an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of his heart, to confirm her diagnosis.The diuretic kept him in the bathroom for much of the next two days, but it didnt seem to help at all. And so his wife, with the support of his friends, finally convinced the breathless man not to wait for the echo but to go right then to the big university hospital in Huntsville.A Healthy Guy, Until NowAs the man and his wife told their story, Dr. Centor took a good look at his new patient. He was tanned and trim    clearly not someone who spent much time being sick. But he coughed frequently, and every paroxysm brought a grimace of pain to his face.Before this, the man told him, hed been pretty healthy. He took a medication for high blood pressure and another for his heartburn. A month earlier, hed had knee surgery, an operation that left him with a big pus-filled wound  red, hot and incredibly painful. So, for the past few weeks his wife had been injecting a syringe full of an antibiotic, called Cubicin, into an intravenous line he had snaking up through his left arm. It was clearly doing its job because, although his knee was still pretty sore, there was no more pus and it looked a whole lot better.He quit smoking five years ago. He drank sometimes with his pals on special occasions but hadnt had anything since he started taking the antibiotic. He exercised regularly, at least before the surgery.The couple had a dog, but no birds or other pets. He had retired five years earlier, but during his career he had been assigned to bases all over the world  especially the Middle East. He spent a lot of time in Afghanistan. And hed done some time as a pilot in Vietnam, where hed been exposed to Agent Orange, the herbicide used there that had been associated with many health problems later in life.Working to BreatheOn exam, the patients breathing and heart rate were high and his oxygen level was low  a bad combination.Dr. Centor gently placed a hand on each side of the patients neck and could feel the strap muscles there tense with every breath. These muscles are recruited to help breathing when needed; they pull the rib cage up to help the patient suck in more air. And when Dr. Centor listened to the patients lungs he heard a cacophony of tiny snaps with every breath, as if inside his ribs a sheet of bubble wrap was exploding. His knee revealed a well healing surgical scar.Dr. Centor had already seen the X-ray and CT scan done the day before. You can see the chest X-ray and the CT report here.Reviewing the NotesThe radiologist thought it was an infection, and so the patient had been started on the usual antibiotic combination for pneumonia. But why had this healthy retiree developed a whopping pneumonia  not in part of one lung, which is usually what occurs with pneumonia, but all over, and in both lungs?Dr. Centor reviewed the notes from the E.R. and from his resident, and the data from the labs. You can see those notes and labs here.Solving the MysteryWhat was he missing? Dr. Centor asked himself.He figured it out. Can you?Submit your responses in the Comments section. As usual, the first person to figure out the diagnosis gets a copy of my book. And that warm satisfaction that comes from solving a mystery.Updated, Friday Feb. 5 12:43 p.m. | Thanks for all your responses!

And that means someone will be inaugurated.So while voters can fill in the blank in November, Congress on Wednesday took the first steps toward planning the party, as the House formally adopted a resolution establishing a Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. From here on out, referred to as the joint committee,  as the resolution stated.The Senate adopted the resolution on Jan. 20, precisely one year before the anticipated festivities. According to the resolution, the joint committee, consisting of three senators and three members of the House, is authorized to make the necessary arrangements for the inauguration of the president-elect and vice president-elect of the United States on January 20, 2017. (Comforting to know its not for the president-elect of Nauru.)The joint committee, by congressional decree, is authorized to use the necessary equipment, personnel and services of the federal government. And, perhaps most important to taxpayers, the joint committee may accept gifts and donations of goods and services to carry out its responsibilities.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "Almost four years ago, the home improvement retailer Lowes set off a political storm in Quebec with a hostile bid for Rona, a Canadian chain headquartered in that province.On Wednesday, Lowes was back again, this time with a friendly deal to acquire Rona for 3.2 billion Canadian dollars, or $2.3 billion, in cash.While the transaction may face some regulatory hurdles, initial indications were that it would not be brought down by political considerations like the Lowes hostile $1.8 billion offer in 2012.If so, the acquisition will let Lowes overtake the Canadian unit of Home Depot as the dominant home improvement company in the country.One of the big differences between this and last time is obviously this time we have the unanimous approval and support of the board of directors of Rona as well as the management team, Robert A. Niblock, Lowes chairman, president and chief executive, said in an interview. Were in a much better place than where we were in 2012.Under the terms of the deal, Lowes, based in Mooresville, N.C., would pay 24 Canadian dollars a share in cash for each share of Ronas common stock and 20 Canadian dollars a share for each preferred share of Rona.The latest offer is about double Ronas closing price on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Rona shares closed up 98 percent, to 23.30 Canadian dollars, roughly matching the bid. Lowes latest move to expand in Canada comes shortly after the company abandoned the Australian market, where it had operated a home improvement chain in a joint venture.Mr. Niblock acknowledged on Wednesday that Lowes still had not reached its optimum size in Canada since entering the market in 2007. Lowes has 42 stores in Canada out of more than 1,845 home improvement and hardware stores in North America, including Mexico.The company is now transforming four locations previously leased by Target, which left Canada last year. The Rona transaction, however, will significantly bolster Lowes business throughout Canada and give the company its first locations in Quebec, where Rona is the market leader.Rona operates more than 500 corporate-owned and independent affiliate stores, including many small outlets in rural communities. The combined business would have generated 2015 revenue of about 5.6 billion Canadian dollars. Lowes announced several steps to ease political concerns in Quebec.It will continue to operate the stores it is buying under Ronas brand names. Lowes Canadian head office will move to Boucherville, Quebec, Ronas home, and continue to buy from Canadian suppliers.Lowes said that it would continue to employ the vast majority of Ronas staff and management. Sylvain Prudhomme, the president of Lowes Canada, will continue in that role after the takeover. Since 2012, Rona has changed most of its senior management and closed several stores.In a news conference, Robert Chevrier, the chairman of Rona, said that the political climate in Quebec had also evolved.Why are we selling? he said. Let me put it this way: This is a very, very attractive price and a very compelling price.While politicians from both major political parties opposed the earlier bid by Lowes, on Wednesday, Dominique Anglade, Quebecs minister of the economy, sciences and innovation, said that the Liberal government supported the latest bid.The Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec,the provinces pension and investment fund, which is one of Ronas largest shareholders, also said it supported the sale.But Pierre Karl Pladeau, the leader of the separatist Parti Qubcois, condemned the deal both on social media and in comments to reporters.While the federal government is expected to approve the deal under its foreign investment laws, its competition bureau may require Lowes to sell stores in some parts of the country.Mr. Niblock said there were relatively few markets where the two chains overlap.Canadas economy has become unsettled by the global collapse in prices of commodities, particularly oil. The fall of the value of the Canadian dollar, which stems from that, makes things particularly difficult for retailers. While the weak dollar has pushed up the cost of imported merchandise substantially, competitive pressures make it difficult for retailers to recover the increase fully through higher prices.But Mr. Niblock said that Canadas high levels of homeownership and its general stable financial situation, even during the 2008 financial crisis, made it an attractive market for Lowes.There are a lot of things that set up very well for our sector of retail, he said."}

The group burst into the spotlight this week after two Virginia Tech students were charged in the abduction and murder of the girl, Nicole Madison Lovell of Blacksburg, Va. The students  David Eisenhauer, 18, of Columbia, Md., and Natalie Marie Keepers, 19, of Laurel, Md.  are being held without bond. Nicole is believed to have met Mr. Eisenhauer through social media, though there has been no assertion that they connected on Facebook. But her brief comments on the page of the teen dating group, which had more than 18,000 members, drew attention to the group, prompting Facebook to investigate. The spokeswoman said the group violated Facebooks published community standards, which ban, among other things, nude images, threats, bullying, harassment, and anything that promotes sexual exploitation."}
{"text": "The story of the 1951 annual Explorers Club dinner is famous, at least among explorers, paleontologists and connoisseurs of exotic cuisine. In brief, mammoth was served.A club member and journalist reported on the menu shortly afterward in The Christian Science Monitor, and club members have been talking about it ever since.At my first dinner, when I was a new member, they told me about it, said Jack Horner, a dinosaur paleontologist at Montana State University and an inspiration for the character of the paleontologist in the original Jurassic Park book. And they were talking about having another.Sadly, as with so many great stories, this one was too good to be true, as a group of Yale researchers reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. Fortunately, the tale they uncovered, using the most modern research techniques, has some of its own surprises.The story has to begin with the meat itself, originally billed on the menu as Megatherium, an extinct ground sloth, but recalled over the decades as mammoth, perhaps because that was what it was called in the article in The Monitor. What it was finally determined to be will, of course, have to wait until the end of the story.Eating fossil meat may seem hazardous, but animals that died thousands of years ago have been found frozen, and the Yale researchers point to credible reports of paleontologists sampling the ancient flesh of extinct bison and mammoth. Care is called for, however, since the meat may have rotted before the cold preserved it.The reason it was even possible to check what the diners ate is that some leftovers ended up on a shelf in the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.Paul Griswold Howes, a club member, was unable to make the 1951 dinner, which must have been a great disappointment because, as the researchers note, the annual dinners have made the club as well known for its notorious hors doeuvres like fried tarantulas and goat eyeballs as it is for its notable members such as Teddy Roosevelt and Neil Armstrong.Mr. Howes was, however, the curator-director at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., and even if he could not attend the dinner, he wanted to exhibit some of it at the museum. So Wendell Phillips Dodge, a theater impresario who had organized the dinner, sent Mr. Howes a sample, which he labeled Megatherium.That sample found its way to the Peabody in 2001, prompting years of puzzlement among students and professors. Was this jar of ethanol with a bit of flesh really cooked, extinct ground sloth from Alaska?Recently, Matt Davis, a graduate student at Yale studying ice age ecology and one of the authors of the new paper, was having lunch with Eric Sargis, another author, who was giving a course in mammalogy. Mr. Davis was a teaching assistant for the course, and at the lunch, Dr. Sargis lamented, Its amazing that I cant get anybody interested in the piece of sloth meat we have.Mr. Davis recalled, I was immediately hooked.DNA analysis was called for, and they recruited Jessica R. Glass, another graduate student, and the first author on the paper, whose day job is studying the genetics of marine fish. As an undergraduate at Yale, she said, I always knew about this specimen, adding, I was fascinated by it.She and other scientists joined the team. They assumed the flesh was thousands of years old, which meant that testing for DNA was more complicated than testing a more recent bit of flesh. Also, she said, the meat was cooked.There was some legitimate science to be done. If the meat was really Megatherium, that would extend the species known range from South America all the way to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.In the end, after multiple tests, the team determined that the meat was neither mammoth nor sloth, nor ancient, nor even a mammal. Turtle soup had also been on the menu that night, before sea turtles were in such trouble, and the bit of flesh that the scientists tested turned out to be green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas.It seems that Mr. Dodge had been having a bit of fun, and that he was the only one in on the joke.I do want to point out that it wasnt a big hoax from the Explorers Club, Ms. Glass added.Mr. Dodge even confessed, sort of. In a club publication soon after the dinner, he seemed to say that he had passed off turtle as sloth. The scientists write that he fancifully described the sloths fossil history but hinted that he may have discovered a potion by means of which he could change, say, Cheylone mydas Cheuba [sic] from the Indian Ocean into Giant Sloth.But nobody paid attention to him, and the story persisted.Several of the researchers are members of the Explorers Club, which gave grants to support the DNA analysis and research.Will Roseman, the clubs executive director, said it was pleased with the research, although he pointed out that the world and the club had both changed since 1951, and the old taste for the exotic has given way to a determined effort to introduce people to the foods that can sustain mankind well into the future."}
{"text": "Richard Anderson, the outspoken chief executive of Delta Air Lines, who led the airlines transformation into one of the worlds most profitable and well-run carriers, will retire in May, the airline said on Wednesday.Mr. Anderson, 60, who will become Deltas executive chairman, will be replaced as chief executive by Ed Bastian, the airlines president.One of the longest-serving airline executives in recent times, Mr. Anderson took the top job at Delta in 2007 shortly after the airline had emerged from bankruptcy. He orchestrated a merger with Northwest Airlines the following year, a move that helped push the rest of the industry toward greater consolidation and set the template for successful airline combinations.Born in Galveston, Tex., and trained as a lawyer, Mr. Anderson has been a vocal champion of his airline and is known for his blunt views of the industry.He led the opposition to the growth of Middle East carriers in the United States, a position that has the support of American Airlines and United Airlines but divided the rest of the domestic aviation community. The high-profile campaign has so far failed to sway the Obama administration or force a renegotiation of open skies agreements.While Deltas succession plan was well established, the timing of the announcement took some aviation experts by surprise.He wrote the book on successful airline merger planning and execution, and on employee engagement, and Deltas results show it, said Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst.Deltas performance in 2015, for instance, is testimony to how Mr. Anderson built the airline into a global powerhouse. Delta had $4.5 billion in net income last year, aided by falling oil prices, and it gave $1.5 billion to employees under its profit-sharing plan.Mr. Anderson also helped cement successful joint-venture agreements with foreign airlines, including a North Atlantic partnership with Air France KLM that shares flights, revenues and costs on certain routes between the airlines.In 2012, Delta bought a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic to challenge the alliance of American Airlines and British Airways in their backyard at Heathrow Airport in London.And at a time of rising oil prices, Delta made a bold bet to offset the rising cost of jet fuel: It bought a refinery in Pennsylvania. At the time, Mr. Anderson said the investment was a relatively modest one, comparable to the purchase of a single Boeing 777.The early completion of the merger with Northwest, ahead of Uniteds complicated merger with Continental and the more recent merger between American and US Airways, also allowed Delta to improve operations before its main rivals.As a result, Delta today is an industry leader in on-time performance. In January, for instance, when much of the East Coast was buried by an enormous snowstorm, Deltas percentage of flights not canceled, a measure known as mainline completion factor, was an industry-leading 98.7 percent. More than 85 percent of its flights also landed on time.The company was valued at $34 billion on Wednesday after the close of markets.But Mr. Andersons legacy is also marked by more controversial positions. He has opposed the extension of financing by the Export-Import Bank, arguing it created unfair competition, and has pressed other airline executives to block the expansion of the Persian Gulf-based carriers in the United States.Delta has opposed a move to privatize part of the nations air-traffic control system, saying the move carried serious risks and offered speculative benefits. Disagreements over this issue was a reason behind Deltas decision last year to leave the industrys trade group, Airlines for America.Mr. Andersons planned departure is the third high-profile move recently at the top of a United States airline, after the resignation last year of Jeffery A. Smisek at United and the departure of Ben Baldanza at Spirit Airlines at the beginning of the year.Mr. Anderson began his aviation career at Continental Airlines in 1987, and was at Northwest Airlines between 1990 and 2004, where he served as chief executive for three years before becoming chief of the UnitedHealth Group.Mr. Anderson will step down on May 2, his birthday.This succession plan has been several years in the making and will keep Delta on top of the global industry, said Daniel A. Carp, Deltas chairman of the board.Among other moves at Delta, the airline said Glen Hauenstein, the companys executive vice president, would become president.Richard has also done a lot to help improve the airlines employee culture, which has helped keep Delta relatively union-free, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the founder of Atmosphere Research Group."}

So he begged the audience, Please clap. At least they did.On Wednesday, a post on Mr. Bushs website boasted, Jeb Surges to Second in New Hampshire Republican Primary Poll. The post also included the following poll results, from Harper Polling:Its true that given Mr. Bushs disappointing performance in Iowa, hitting second in New Hampshire is probably a relief. Still, you know your campaign is struggling when being 17 points out of first place constitutes a surge.Not giving up just yet, Mr. Bush will hold a town hall on Thursday night with his mother  who, as Kenneth T. Walsh of U.S. News & World Report reminds us, didnt think he should run in the first place.Mr. Bush has said people packin is part of the answer to fighting terrorism. If elected president, he says he would defund Planned Parenthood by executive action. His comments about his brothers invasion of Iraq have ranged from incoherent to frightening. His exit from the race, should it happen, will be no loss  except for one thing.Heres Mr. Bush on Donald Trump, in an interview with NewsMax Prime:I find it offensive when he insults the disabled, women, Hispanics, POWs, calling them loser cause they got caught. This is disgusting. Its not a sign of leadership, its certainly not a sign of strength. This notion that you just raise the volume of your voice and say ugly things. That makes you strong. Wow, thats just totally the opposite, its a sign of deep insecurity and weakness.And during the fifthRepublican debate, on Mr. Trumps plan to temporarily ban Muslims from the United States:This is not a serious proposal. In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.So Donald, you know, is great at  at the one-liners, but hes a chaos candidate. And hed be a chaos president.Mr. Bushs effort to paint himself as the order candidate is not getting him anywhere so far. But hes been one of the few Republicans to truly call out Mr. Trumps terrifyingly wrong-headed ideas. His frustration with the idiocy of Mr. Trumps proposals is palpable on the debate stage, and its hard not to feel for him in those moments. I dont mind seeing Mr. Bush lose, but I dont like seeing him lose to Donald Trump any more than he does."}
{"text": "BEIJING   A Chinese journalist who disappeared while seeking refuge in Thailand told his wife by telephone on Wednesday that he had returned to China and was being held by the police, she said.The 10-minute call was the first sign of life the journalist, Li Xin, had given to his wife, He Fangmei, since he disappeared near Thailands border with Laos last month. Mr. Li had been trying for months to avoid returning to China, fearing that he would be persecuted here for having revealed that state security operatives had coerced him into becoming an informant, and for having described censorship in the state-run news media.He said, Wife, its me, Li Xin, Ms. He said by telephone from her home in Henan Province, in central China. He said that hed returned to China voluntarily and was under investigation, but he didnt say where he was in China.He told me to celebrate the New Year holiday with his family and to make sure I kept healthy, she added. The annual Lunar New Year holiday starts Sunday evening.Mr. Li had been an editor for the website of The Southern Metropolitan Daily, a popular and sometimes combative Chinese newspaper. Neither the Chinese nor the Thai governments had said whether they were holding Mr. Li.Asked about the case on Wednesday, the Thai authorities said immigration records indicated that Mr. Li was still in Thailand. Sek Wannamethee, a spokesman for the Thai Foreign Ministry, said there was no record as yet as to whether he has left the country.There is no indication whatsoever that Mr. Li Xin was abducted from Thailand, Mr. Sek said in a message, without elaborating.But Ms. He maintained that the phone call from her husband indicated that he had become the latest in a series of Chinese citizens or foreigners with Chinese ancestry who have been impelled while abroad to go to China to cooperate with secretive inquiries.Critics have said that these people are victims of illicit renditions by increasingly bold Chinese security forces, and Ms. He said she believed that Mr. Li would have returned to China only under force or threats, despite his assertion that he came back freely.His tone was like theyd given him guidance, Ms. He said. She said that her husband sounded calm, but that he had told her not to interrupt him with questions.I said to him, Where are you? Just where are you? Tell me. At the very least, I have to find a lawyer for you, Ms. He said. But the line was silent for a long time, and I knew someone at his side was telling him what to say, and he said, Dont get involved. Dont ask so much. Im doing fine.In the call, Mr. Li did not specify why he was under investigation, referring only to that case, Ms. He said, adding that she took that to refer to claims that Mr. Li made, after arriving in India in October, that Chinese state security agents had coerced him into becoming an informant against fellow journalists and friends who worked for civic groups.In October, Gui Minhai, a book publisher in Hong Kong who was born in China and holds Swedish citizenship, disappeared from his vacation home in the Thai coastal town of Pattaya. He was shown on Chinese television last month confessing to having violated his probation in a deadly road accident by leaving China in 2003.In November, two Chinese dissidents in Thailand, Jiang Yefei and Dong Guanping, were sent back to China despite having been recognized as refugees by the United Nations refugee agency. The Chinese police later said that the men were suspected of crimes involving illegal border crossing.Mr. Li had first gone to India, apparently hoping to obtain a visa to the United States, where he intended to apply for asylum. Failing that, he hoped to extend his stay in India. He succeeded at neither, and decided to go to Thailand. There, he hoped to receive official status as a refugee and qualify for settlement in another country, Ms. He said. To do that, he had to leave Thailand and re-enter with a new tourist visa."}
{"text": "Whether its TV ratings or avocado consumption, were inundated with ways to quantify the annual extravagance that is the Super Bowl. I would like to suggest another avenue of analysis: publicly available New York City taxi data.Taxi usage patterns provide an insight into how exciting the game was and even say something about which halftime performers were most popular.Lets start with last years game, between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.Taxi activitys lowest level in New York coincided with the climactic moment of the game, just as Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson at 9:59 p.m. to secure the 28-24 victory for the Patriots. New England called a timeout after Butlers interception, but many Super Bowl party guests apparently didnt wait around to watch Tom Brady take a knee before they hailed cabs. Taxi activity spiked soon after the interception and continued to rise, reaching its peak just minutes after the 10:06 p.m. final whistle.That was a close, exciting game, so it makes sense that people stayed until the very end. What happens when games are blowouts? One year earlier, the Seahawks dominated the Broncos, 43-8, in a game that was effectively over in the third quarter.A lot of people didnt stick around to watch the Seahawks coronation; taxi activity increased throughout the fourth quarter, similar to the way fans flee stadiums early when one team has an insurmountable lead.In general, the more exciting the game, the less taxi use during the fourth quarter and the larger the postgame spike. That pattern has repeated itself every year since 2009, with the exception of 2014, which was the only lopsided contest in that period.When it comes to halftime performances, I wasnt surprised to see that taxi activity picks up at the beginning of halftime. People may want to use the 30-minute window to, among other things, leave one party and watch the second half somewhere else.But I was surprised to see an increase in taxi activity at the end of halftime. That wouldnt be a good time to leave a party  unless you werent there to watch the game. Some Super Bowl party guests seem to care primarily about the halftime show, and once its over, they do something else. (When you think about it, halftime performers are often megastars with millions of their own fans, not all of whom care about football.)We can also get an idea from taxi activity which Super Bowl halftime performances were most anticipated: when there are fewer trips at the beginning of halftime  representing people who dont want to miss the halftime show  and more taxis at the end of halftime.By this admittedly crude standard, Beyoncs 2013 Super Bowl performance was the most highly anticipated by New Yorkers. The Black Eyed Peas and Bruce Springsteen seem to be the least popular judging from the bump in people taking taxis in the middle of their shows.Beyonc is on stage again this year, joining Coldplay and Bruno Mars, so well see if the pattern holds."}
{"text": "We shall overcome, we shall overcome,\nWe shall overcome someday;\nOh, deep in my heart, I do believe,\nWe shall overcome someday.The simple, aspirational lyrics of We Shall Overcome have been sung by everyone from churchgoers to civil rights protesters to Southern labor activists to the United States president.The song is part of a long history of protest music that has helped to open eyes and awaken consciences since the earliest years of American life, and the tradition continues today.Studying the protest music of the past or present can be a powerful and engaging teaching tool for students, whether the goal is to better understand a historical time period, analyze the power of lyrics and poetry, understand forces of social change or respond to current issues.In this lesson, we provide teaching ideas from The Times and around the web for incorporating protest music, from the civil rights movement to Black Lives Matter, into your social studies or language arts curriculum. It is, however, only a starting point: We hope youll suggest additional songs, artists and articles in the comments.Ways to Incorporate Protest Music Into Your Humanities CurriculumOhio performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash & YoungMusic can be a primary source for studying history, just like a photograph, newspaper article or diary entry. And listening to music can be an engaging way for students to learn more about the attitudes and culture of a particular time period.Below, we outline a lesson template that can be used to incorporate any protest song into your class. Note that the assumption is students have some background knowledge of the time period whether its the Great Depression or apartheid-era South Africa.Write and Discuss: Why do you listen to music? How does music make you feel? Does music serve a different role in your life depending on your mood, who you are with or what you are doing? Does music ever cause you to think differently, to feel a part of something larger or to want to rise up and take action?Then, respond to this quotation by Pete Seeger, a champion of folk music, who died in 2014:One of the purposes of music is to help you forget your troubles; another, help you learn from your troubles (some do), and, some will help you do something about your troubles.Do you agree? Why?Listen and Annotate: Next, listen to ____________, a protest song from the time period we are studying, while reading along with the printed lyrics. As you listen, annotate by underlining, highlighting or writing in the margins  reacting or responding to anything in the lyrics or in the music itself. (You may want to play the song a second time, if it would be helpful.)Discuss:(The above three questions are adapted from the facilitation protocol we use in our regular Monday feature Whats Going On in This Picture?)Then, once students have responded to the song, ask the following questions (if they havent already come up organically):\nHow does the song connect to the time period were studying?\nDo you think the song is effective as a protest song? Why?Ideas for Going FurtherRepeat: You can assign students to small groups to listen to other protest songs from that time period and annotate the lyrics, and then report back to the class about what they heard.Write Your Own Protest Song or Verse: If you are studying specific content, like the Great Depression or the civil rights movement, students can write their own protest song about that event, or they can compose an original verse for an existing song.Bring in Contemporary Music That Speaks to an Issue or Era in the Past: What songs today have something to say about the past, whether because people are still struggling with the same issues, or because the lyrics seem symbolic or ironic when seen through the lens of the past?Create an Annotated Playlist or Podcast of Protest Music That Matters to You: Throughout the unit or as a culminating project, invite students to bring in protest songs that matter to them, from any era and about any topic. As a class, they might then create an annotated playlist or a podcast that features discussion by the students and snippets of each of the songs.Examples of Protest Music From Different Times, Places and GenresThe Civil Rights MovementWe Shall Overcome sung by Mahalia JacksonIn the midst of the civil rights movement, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told The Times in this 1962 article: The freedom songs are playing a strong and vital role in our struggle. They give the people new courage and a sense of unity. I think they keep alive a faith, a radiant hope, in the future, particularly in our most trying hours.Five decades later, Ethan J. Kytle and Blain Roberts reflect on how the story of We Shall Overcome illuminates the rich history of the black freedom struggle. In their Op-Ed essay, Birth of a Freedom Anthem, they write:Fifty years ago today, on March 15, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced plans to submit a new voting rights bill before a joint session of Congress. His speech came after several weeks of violence in and around Selma, Ala., that had taken the lives of two civil rights activists and left dozens of others bloodied. Seventy million Americans watched on television as Johnson, a Texas Democrat who had supported segregationist policies early in his career, proclaimed racial discrimination not a Negro problem but an American problem. It is not, he said, just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. Then, after a pause, he added, And we shall overcome.Few Americans could have missed the significance of these four words. Since the early 1960s, We Shall Overcome had served as the unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement. Protesters sang the song during the 1963 March on Washington, the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer campaign and the demonstrations in Selma. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. watched the broadcast in a Selma living room, a tear ran down his cheek.Rock and Roll: An American Story, a free online curriculum presented by Steven Van Zandts Rock and Roll Forever Foundation, provides a detailed lesson plan that explores the significance of We Shall Overcome in the civil rights movement. Included in the lesson are video clips of President Johnsons We Shall Overcome speech and the March on Washington, when the crowd broke into song. The lesson also asks students to listen to Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday and Mississippi Goddam by Nina Simone, as well as other movement songs.The above Op-Ed essay could easily be embedded in that lesson as a way to better understand how We Shall Overcome first came to the civil rights movement and how it found its way into the presidents speech.South Africa and the Songs of FreedomFree Nelson Mandela performed by The SpecialsCan songs be more powerful than speeches? This is the question that Anglique Kidjo, a Grammy award-winning Beninese singer-songwriter and activist, addresses in her Opinion piece Songs of Freedom. She writes:IN 1974, I was a young girl watching the Nigerian newscast on our blinking TV set, sitting on the patio of the family house in Cotonou, Benin. Suddenly I saw Winnie Mandela in the middle of a crowd, talking about her husband in jail in South Africa. That was the first time I heard about apartheid.My whole world collapsed.I had been raised with nine brothers and sisters in a modest and loving family, protected from the harsh realities of my continent. My parents had told me that you dont judge people by their color and that were all born equal. Every day, we welcomed expatriates from all corners of the world.That day, on the TV screen, I could see the anger and the despair in the eyes of the South Africans. I was learning about the injustice of apartheid. I felt a sudden rage.I had been singing on stage since I was six; music was the center of my life. My first reaction was to write a song: instead of screaming my rage I would sing it.The song that came to me was a harsh and hateful song. When my father heard it, he told me:  You cant sing this, music is not there to preach hate and violence. I understand your frustration and your pain, but you cant use your songs to add fuel to the fire. Music is supposed to bring people together and fight for peace, because it is art and beauty, not politics.Many years later, I truly believe that music helped free Mandela. Johnny Cleggs Asimbonanga comes to mind, as does Peter Gabriels Biko. So many artists wrote songs for Mandela, putting much international pressure on South Africa.The songs were stronger than speeches. Who will remember a politicians speeches? But everyone can sing Bob Marleys lines, Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. The few political speeches that have made a mark in history  from Haile Selassie, Martin Luther King or John F. Kennedy  sound like songs!That is the power of music. The mix of melodies and words carries a message much more powerful than spoken ideas.Why? Maybe because when someone sings, truth speak directly to your heart.What do you think? Read the entire article and listen to some of the musical tributes to Nelson Mandela to which she refers.Then consider whether you agree that music in itself is the expression of freedom. Do agree that universal access to music must be cherished?Hip-Hop as Protest, Yesterday and TodayIn the 80s and 90s, hip-hop artists like Public Enemy protested over social issues, urging black solidarity and an end to compromise.Though they were often condemned for violent words or images, today Public Enemy is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and the gangsta rap group N.W.A., then seen by outsiders as aggressive, profane young black men talking about mayhem, is the subject of a hit, mainstream movie.Some are nostalgic for the early days of hip-hop and question whether music today still has something to say. But, as Stereo Williams wrote in 2015  for The Daily Beast:We love to look back at when hip-hop meant something. The block parties that birthed hip-hop were intended to bring black youth together under a banner of unity and creativity, and the uber-classic hip-hop single The Message was released all the way back in 1982, but socially conscious rap music didnt become consistently visible until the late 1980s, when acts like Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions were discussing everything from the prison industrial complex to the hypocrisy of the war on drugs in their songs. Against a backdrop of Reagan and Bush, the murder of Yusef Hawkins and the Rodney King beating, rappers raged on wax, and it gave voice to a lot of the frustration that was felt in the community. Hip-hop stars like Chuck D, Ice Cube, and 2Pac were often asked by the media to offer commentary on what was going on  giving credence to Chuck Ds famous adage that hip-hop of the time was CNN for black people.In the last year, the seemingly endless proliferation of racially charged incidents and ongoing civil unrest has kept the national conversation fixed on race. And there have been several high-profile releases from hip-hop and soul artists that have been reflective of the tension, frustration, and anger. From DAngelos Black Messiah to Run the Jewels 2 to the latest album from Kendrick Lamar, To Pimp A Butterfly, there are a growing number of releases that are attempting to express some of what the streets appear to be feeling. Beyond the standard musings about the hard-knock life or abstract stabs at commentary, these projects are somehow both artistically focused and thematically conflicted. This is no strident preaching; this is emotional, and confused. This is not Fight the Power nor is it A Change Is Gonna Come. This is somethings gotta give  and were getting tired of asking. And a lot of it is brilliant.Last March, Jon Caramanica reviewed Kendrick Lamars To Pimp a Butterfly, an album that has already been annotated on Genius by hundreds of people. He wrote:At its best, its a howling work of black protest art on par with Amiri Barakas incendiary play Dutchman, or David Hammonss moving decapitated hoodie In the Hood (seen most recently on the cover of Claudia Rankines poetry collection Citizen: An American Lyric)  works rooted in both pride and fear.On For Free? (Interlude), hes indignant, lashing out at a society that gave him only the barest essentials and dared him to thrive: Like I never made ends meet eatin your leftovers and raw meat. On The Blacker the Berry, he returns time and again to a wounded question  You hate me, dont you?  and calls out the structures of power that suggest that black lives dont matter:Its evident that Im irrelevant to societyThats what youre telling me, penitentiary would only hire meSalamishah Tillet declared in The Atlantic that, for the first time since the late-1960s, the U.S. is seeing the revival and redefinition of protest music. She, too, is talking about the Black Lives Matter movement. Here are three of the songs she mentions:Be Free, sung by J. Cole.\nBlack Rage, sung by Lauryn Hill.\nGlory, performed by John Legend and Common.Is hip-hop music still CNN for black people? Is it a positive force for change in society? What role has it played in politics around the world  from Egypt to France to Cuba? Why is it such an effective form of expression and protest?Invite students to make their own annotated playlists that look at particular themes, ideas or metaphors in hip-hop history, or that trace the social history of or the public reaction to the genre from its earliest roots.Protest Music Around the World NowSalam performed by Shahin NajafiIn 2003, Brent Staples expressed his concern that protest music might never again be the force of change and solidarity it once was.He wrote that independent radio stations that once would have played edgy, political music have been gobbled up by corporations that control hundreds of stations and have no wish to rock the boat. But in the dozen years since, a digital revolution has upturned the global music industry. iTunes, YouTube and Spotify completely altered how we discover new music. And protest songs, once again, have a way to reach the people, here in the United States and all around the world.Macklemore and Ryan Lewiss song in support of gay and lesbian equality has been streamed over 150 million times on YouTube.And Beyoncs ***Flawless, featuring the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, has become a feminist declaration for many.Shahin Najafi, an Iranian rapper living in exile in Germany, uploads his songs to the Internet and reaches his countrymen living in Iran (if they find a way around the Iranian government censors).And Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist punk group, whose anti-Putin stunts landed them in prison in 2012 and made them a global cause clbre, can also release a song in English about police brutality in America.Have students listen to one or more of the protest songs included in this post. They can listen, annotate and discuss, as we outlined above. Then they should choose the issue or issues they care most about, and write their own protest lyrics. Music is optional.For more inspiration, students can consider that musicians have sung about almost everything, from standing against domestic violence, to supporting birth control for women, to fighting against poverty, to assailing common attitudes toward Latinos in the United States.A Beginning Library of Protest SongsThe Ghost of Tom Joad performed by Bruce Springsteen and Tom MorelloWeve put together the following abridged list of protest songs from different eras. To provide lyrics, and in most cases annotations and the song itself, we linked to Genius, the crowd-sourced lyrics annotation site.Do you teach with protest songs in your class?

{"text": "SUMNER REDSTONE STEPS DOWN  |  Sumner M. Redstone, who was under pressure from shareholders and faced a lawsuit challenging his mental competence, resigned as executive chairman of CBS,Emily Steel reports in The New York Times. He will be succeeded by Leslie Moonves, the CBS chief executive.At the same time, a battle for control is underway at Viacom, the other half of Mr. Redstones conglomerate, which includes MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures.Viacoms board is scheduled to meet on Thursday, and the directors are expected to discuss who would succeed Mr. Redstone.The 92-year-old Mr. Redstone continues to control about 80 percent of the voting stock in the two companies through National Amusements, the private theater chain company that his father started.He never publicly unveiled succession plans for either company and the rare statements he did make often fueled more speculation and uncertainty. Many analysts expect a fierce and litigious struggle for power.The executives who prevail will set the agenda at two of the worlds largest entertainment companies. Media bankers and analysts also expect those two companies to be involved in a wave of deal activity that could reshape the media landscape.Some media bankers have speculated that Mr. Redstones death would make way for CBS and Viacom to reunite, but Mr. Moonves is said not to support that idea, according to people briefed on his thinking.Viacom has a tricky transition ahead,\nJennifer Saba writes in Breakingviews. Its performance has trailed that of CBS, which was supposed to be the more boring of the two when they split a decade ago, and shareholders are restless.Philippe P. Dauman, the Viacom chief executive, is a likely successor, but he does not appear to have the support of Mr. Redstones daughter, Shari Redstone, who is vice chairwoman of CBS and Viacom.Mr. Dauman serves as a Redstone trustee in the event of Mr. Redstones death, as well as his health care proxy. Ms. Redstone has made it clear that she did not want a trustee, or someone intertwined with the family to become chairman at either CBS or Viacom. This ruled out her and Mr. Dauman.CHEMCHINAS BOLD PLAY FOR SYNGENTA  |  Chinese companies have shown themselves willing to put up increasingly larger sums of money to acquire foreign agricultural counterparts,\nAlexandra Stevenson, Chad Bray and Amie Tsang write in DealBook. The deal to buy Syngenta for $43 billion further underscores Chinas desire to secure a sustainable food supply for its population. \nThe slump in commodity prices has worked out in ChemChinas favor, decreasing the chances of a big payday for Syngenta. \nThe deal also comes as Beijing grapples with its long-held resistance to genetically modified crops and its  efforts to nurture a homegrown genetically modified crop industry, while trying to ease public skepticism about it. \nFears of Frankenfoods aside, ChemChina will need some Frankenfinancing to take over Syngenta, Quentin Webb writes in Breakingviews.\nHSBC and Citic Bank are providing acquisition financing, but the question is how the deal will be funded in the long term. Syngenta could shoulder some of the burden. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are expected to be a little more than $2.8 billion. Cranking up debt to  6.5 times those earnings would let Syngenta assume $15.8 billion more in bonds and loans. \nChemChina would need to scrape together the remaining $28 billion. The group had cash of about 29.8 billion renminbi, or about $4.5 billion, at the end of September and debt of about 232 billion renminbi, so it would need help from Chinese banks. The lenders could tap the Shanghai bond market or wealthy individuals, drawing comfort from the fact that ChemChina is state-owned, but even then, its financing package looks genetically modified, Mr. Webb writes. \nChemChina is inviting banks to join a bridge loan of as much as $25 billion, according a report from Bloomberg News citing people with knowledge of the matter. It is said to be seeking commitments of about $5 billion each from four or five lenders. \nIn spite of the enormous size of the deal, one of the lead advisers is a one-man shop, Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook. Gordon E. Dyal, formerly head of Goldmans merger business and a former co-chairman of the firms investment bank, had counted Syngenta as a client for years. Since stepping down last year, he has emerged as the latest star deal maker to land a plum assignment independently of his former employers.\n\n\n\nTOXIC LOANS WEIGH ON GLOBAL GROWTH  |  Beneath the surface of the global financial system lurks a multitrillion-dollar problem that could sap the strength of economies for years to come,\nPeter Eavis reports in DealBook.\nBad debts have been a drag on economic activity since 2008, but the threat they pose has worsened in recent months. China is the biggest concern, with analysts estimating that its troubled credit could exceed $5 trillion  equivalent to half the countrys annual economic output. \nIf Chinese banks continue to pull back on lending, the economy may slow even more, further harming countries that have relied on China for growth. \nToxic debt also hangs over countries where governments and central banks have unleashed aggressive stimulus policies in recent years. In the United States, energy companies are struggling to pay off the cheap money that they borrowed to pile into the shale boom. \nIn Europe, analysts say bad loans total more than $1 trillion and banks are still burdened with defaulted loans. Bad loans are also on the rise at Brazils biggest banks. \nThe looming question for the global economy is how China might deal with its pool of bad debts. After a previous credit boom in the 1990s, the Chinese government provided financial support to help clean up the countrys banks, but the cost of a similar operation today would be dauntingly high. \nMy sense is that the Chinese policy makers seem like deer in the headlights, said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University. They really dont know what to do.\n\n\n\nON THE AGENDA  |  The Bank of England will make its monetary policy announcement at 7 a.m.\n\n\n\nCREDIT SUISSE REPORTS A HUGE LOSS  |  Credit Suisse said it had lost billions of dollars in the fourth quarter because of an immense charge associated with the write-down of some investment banking operations,\nChad Bray reports in DealBook. It also said that turbulent markets had weighed on its trading and investment banking. \nThe bank reported a loss of 5.83 billion Swiss francs, or about $5.8 billion, in the last three months of 2015. It reported a profit of 691 million francs in the same period a year earlier. \nCredit Suisse said it would accelerate its cost-cutting, eliminating 4,000 positions out of about 48,000 worldwide. \nWe are increasing the pace of our cost-saving program, said Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive.

{"text": "Beneath the surface of the global financial system lurks a multitrillion-dollar problem that could sap the strength of large economies for years to come.The problem is the giant, stagnant pool of loans that companies and people around the world are struggling to pay back. Bad debts have been a drag on economic activity ever since the financial crisis of 2008, but in recent months, the threat posed by an overhang of bad loans appears to be rising. China is the biggest source of worry. Some analysts estimate that Chinas troubled credit could exceed $5 trillion, a staggering number that is equivalent to half the size of the countrys annual economic output.Official figures show that Chinese banks pulled back on their lending in December. If such trends persist, Chinas economy, the second-largest in the world behind the United States, may then slow even more than it has, further harming the many countries that have for years relied on China for their growth.But its not just China. Wherever governments and central banks unleashed aggressive stimulus policies in recent years, a toxic debt hangover has followed. In the United States, it took many months for mortgage defaults to fall after the most recent housing bust  and energy companies are struggling to pay off the cheap money that they borrowed to pile into the shale boom.In Europe, analysts say bad loans total more than $1 trillion. Many large European banks are still burdened with defaulted loans, complicating policy makers efforts to revive the Continents economy. Italy, for instance, announced a plan last week to clean out bad loans from its plodding banking industry.Elsewhere, bad loans are on the rise at Brazils biggest banks, as the country grapples with the effects of an enormous credit binge.If you have a boom and then a bust, you create economic losses, said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit research at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. You can hope the losses one day turn into profits, but if they dont, they are a drag on the economy.In good times, companies and people take on new loans, often at low interest rates, to buy goods and services. When economies slow, these debts become difficult to pay for many borrowers. And the bigger the boom, the more soured debt that is left behind for bankers and policy makers to deal with.In theory, it makes sense for banks to swiftly recognize the losses embedded in bad loans  and then make up for those losses by raising fresh capital. The cleaned-up banks are more likely to start lending again  and thus play their part in fueling the recovery.But in reality, this approach can be difficult to carry out. Recognizing losses on bad loans can mean pushing corporate borrowers into bankruptcy and households into foreclosure. Such disruption can send a chill through the economy, require unpopular taxpayer bailouts and have painful social consequences. And in some cases, the banks might find it extremely difficult to raise fresh capital in the markets.Even so, the drawback of delaying the cleanup is that the banks remain wounded and reluctant to lend, damping any recovery that takes place. Japan, economists say, waited far too long after its credit boom of the 1980s to force its banks to recognize huge losses  and the economy suffered for years after as a result.Now many banking experts are beginning to worry about Chinas bad loans.Fears that the countrys economy is slowing have weighed heavily on global markets in recent months because a weak China can drag down growth globally.Many of these concerns focus on Chinas banking industry. In recent years, banks and other financial companies in China issued a tidal wave of new loans and other credit products, many of which will not be paid back in full.Chinas financial sector will have loans and other financial assets of $30 trillion at the end of this year, up from $9 trillion seven years ago, said Charlene Chu, an analyst in Hong Kong for Autonomous Research.The world has never seen credit growth of this magnitude over a such short time, she said in an email. We believe it has directly or indirectly impacted nearly every asset price in the world, which is why the market is so jittery about the idea that credit problems in China could unravel.Headline figures for bad loans in China most likely do not capture the size of the problem, analysts say. In her analysis, Ms. Chu estimates that at the end of 2016, as much as 22 percent of the Chinese financial systems loans and assets will be nonperforming, a banking industry term used to describe when a borrower has fallen behind on payments or is stressed in ways that make full repayment unlikely. In dollar terms, that works out to $6.6 trillion of troubled loans and assets.This estimate really isnt that unreasonable, Ms. Chu said in the email. Weve seen similar ratios in other countries. Whats different is the scale, which reflects the massive size of Chinas credit boom. She estimates that the bad loans could lead to $4.4 trillion of actual losses.Although there is not enough official data to come up with a precise figure for bad loans, other analysts have come up with estimates of around $5 trillion.Given the murkiness of the Chinese financial industry, other analysts arrive at estimates for a baseline figure for bad loans. Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University, said that an analysis of corporations interest payments to Chinese banks suggested that 8 percent of loans to companies might be troubled. But Mr. Balding said it was possible that the bad loan number for Chinas overall financial system could be higher.The looming question for the global economy, however, is how China might deal with a vast pool of bad debts.After a previous credit boom in the 1990s, the Chinese government provided financial support to help clean up the countrys banks. But the cost of similar interventions today could be dauntingly high given the size of the latest credit boom. And more immediately, rising bad debts could crimp lending to strong companies, undermining economic growth in the process.My sense is that the Chinese policy makers seem like a deer in the headlights, Mr. Balding said. They really dont know what to do.In Europe, for instance, some countries have taken years to come to grips with their banks bad loans.In some cases, the delay arose from a reluctance, at least in part, to force people out of their homes. Even though Irelands biggest banks suffered huge losses after the financial crisis, they held back from forcing many borrowers who had defaulted out of their homes. In recent years, the Irish government has pursued a widespread plan that aims to reduce the debt load of financially stressed homeowners. Such forbearance appears not to have weakened the Irish economy, which has recovered at a faster rate than those of other European countries.Still, the perils of waiting too long are evident in Italy, which in January announced a proposal to help banks sell their bad loans. Some critics of the plan say it resembles a government bailout of the banks, while other skeptics say the banks might not use it because it appears to be too expensive.The big problem in the Italian system is that they acted very late, said Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, a European research firm that focuses on economic issues. They could have done something smarter  and they could have done it earlier."}
{"text": "A City Council hearing on raising members pay began 24 minutes late on Wednesday because members did not arrive on time. Many left in the middle. One gave an impassioned speech about the all-consuming task of representing New Yorkers, while bemoaning the proposed raises as inadequate.Two days before they are expected to vote to increase their salaries by nearly a third, council members held the first, and only, public hearing on the package of bills that would raise their pay while enacting significant reforms, including banning most outside income; ending the extra payments known as lulus for serving on committees; and increasing financial disclosure requirements.Government watchdog groups have long pushed for such changes, and Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., who led the Quadrennial Advisory Commission on pay for city officials last year, has embraced them. The bills that would raise council members pay would also, for the first time since 2006, do the same for several other city officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat whose pay would rise to $258,750 from $225,000. He has said he would forego the raise during his current term.During the testimony on Wednesday, which touched on the potential pitfalls of elected officials doing outside legal work and the criminal convictions of state lawmakers, the proposed reforms were mostly overshadowed by the size of the raise the Council has proposed for itself: to $148,500 from a current base pay of $112,500, $10,185 more than the advisory panel recommended.Mr. Schwarz, a former city corporation counsel who helped revise the City Charter in the 1980s, testified for two hours in an avuncular tone, pointing to gaps in the reasoning of some council members, but stopping short of openly criticizing their pay proposal.Overall we applaud your accepting our central concept that raises for elected officials should among other things reflect the economic conditions of their constituents, he said, adding, When we prepared this testimony, the Council had not yet made its case for its proposed additional raise.Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat who is the Council speaker, said the extra money was meant to offset whatever outside income members would lose under the proposed reforms, though only a few members earn a significant amount of such income. (The proposal still allows income that does not require substantial outside work such as rental income, book royalties or investments.)Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat, said Council staff members had arrived at the $10,185 figure by considering what management workers earned and settled on an hourly rate of about $34  similar to the median rate for a food-service manager  for about 300 hours a year.The proposal, to be retroactive to Jan. 1, would let council members keep earning outside income from any source through the end of their current terms, while collecting the added $10,185. (The bill would also change when future quadrennial commissions convene so that it happens closer to the end of a Council term.)For some on the Council, the raises are not large enough. We work more than 60 hours a week, said Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, a Manhattan Democrat, describing recent nights balancing child care with public events, and taking time when dining out to talk to constituents. He called the proposed raise a big compromise, and said $175,000 would have been more appropriate.Some council members suggested they worked more than their counterparts in other areas of government, an argument that Mr. Schwarz dismissed.It is not the case that other offices dont work very hard; they do, Mr. Schwarz said at one point. He also said elected officials, including the mayor, had never been paid commensurate with their power and influence. Theres always an implicit ceiling, he said, adding that nearly half of New Yorkers are paid at or near the poverty line.The Council has come under criticism for scheduling the vote for Friday, when it will also consider contentious legislation restricting the horse-carriage industry, the subject of growing opposition from a variety of groups as well as back-room vote-wrangling by the de Blasio administration.Dick Dadey of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, called for the vote on the pay proposal to be delayed so that questions about it could be answered and the public could have more input. This is being rushed way too fast, he said after testifying.Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause, expressed mixed feelings about the salary legislation.The process has been far from ideal, she said. But I think that at the end of the day, the total package is an important one, and one that we need to see move forward."}
{"text": "How about one of these days some fashion maverick makes a radically ironic move  sends out, say, a Lawrence Welk collection shown on models sporting toupees?Welk, for the benefit of  well, practically anyone not in assisted living  was the son of dirt-poor North Dakotan German immigrant farmers who earned enduring fame on a television variety show that ran unendingly in the 20th century.One longtime sponsor of the show was Geritol, a dietary supplement advertised as a remedy for iron-poor tired blood. Is it premature to suggest the sophomore season of New York Fashion Week: Mens could use a dose?Based on the first several days of shows and presentations, there is no question things need some pepping up. Expectations were understandably high for the reinstatement of New York on a roster of international mens wear shows; and given the place-holder quality of the recent European shows, the field seemed wide-open for some brash innovator to make a mark.To be sure, there have been some creditable efforts, particularly from obscure indies like, say, Mike Rubin  the designer for the novice Krammer & Stoudt label, which came out of nowhere for Mondays New York Mens Day with a witty collection mashing up inspirations that ranged from the German neo-expressionist artist and dandy Markus Lpertz to Mr. Rubins surfer boyhood in Orange County, Calif.The results were a hybridized, distinctly So-Cal take on athleisure wear, things like a gray cotton-jersey suit whose jacket had no lapels and whose trousers resembled footie pajamas, though without the feet. You could put that on when you get out of the water after surfing and wear it to lunch, Mr. Rubin said. Somebody book a table at the Ivy.Style tropes from Northwest skate-rat culture were a point of departure for Derek Buse and Jo Sadler of the Los Angeles-based CWST, whose determinedly raggedy collection of hobo chic sportswear had the so-wrong-its-right look one associates with the best Japanese mens wear design. In Mr. Sadlers and Mr. Buses hands, clothes in imported Italian and Japanese textiles were outsize, dissonant (pinstripes over camouflage), layered and so offhand they seemed ill-fitting.A pair of wool high-water trousers in a broad check, for instance, looked like what a clown might wear if he were sentenced to life in a penitentiary. A raddled knee-length wool parka looked as though its wearer had gotten drenched in a Seattle downpour and then tumbled dry. These observations are intended as compliments.The young designer David Hart based his latest collection of blanket-plaid jackets and trousers, soft sweaterlike blazers, suede jeans jackets and natty two-button suits on a style he linked to John Coltrane or any of the other jazzmen Francis Wolff photographed in the 50s for Blue Note Records, images immortalized by Reid Miless brilliant cover designs for that label.Impressively resolved as the collection was (especially for a comer who started his label in 2013), it seemed perhaps unnecessarily safe, given it was meant as homage to true creative radicals.The closest any designer came to that notional Lawrence Welk collection was probably Lucio Castros delightfully wacko assortment of mock turtlenecks, culottes, checkered shirts and chevron-quilted puffer jackets in colors that ranged from moss and tobacco to sickroom pink and acid green.The basis for the collection was a group of photographs the designer came upon last year of caravan hippies camping at Stonehenge in the 70s. And you cannot but admire the spirit of someone who claims to find inspiration in the dusty, dirty, stained and ill-fitting rags once worn by a group of pagan druggies roaming the English countryside.Its two flannels, a navy cavalier twill jacket, white shirting from Italy, six looks total: Thats it, the Duckie Brown designer Steven Cox said backstage before his show on Tuesday.True to his word, Mr. Cox gave a presentation that was fashion haiku. It takes a certain kind of brass to gather the most influential people in the industry into a loft and present them with a collection comprising just six looks.Yet so subtly had Mr. Cox and his partner Daniel Silver manipulated scale, made minute alterations in the formula that is a mans suit (a puffer parka, stuffing removed, was worn under a jacket as a shirt) that their collection came off as an airtight argument for short-form fashion and self-editing.If not for the cold dread that settled over attendees at Joseph Abbouds purgatorial show on Monday, there might have been something comical about the contrast between it and the pared-down Duckie Brown one that followed.Making a welcome return to the brand he founded in 1987 and left in 2005  having lost the right to his name  Mr. Abboud presented a collection of tailored suits so gratuitously detailed (buttons marched up the sleeve of one velvet jacket from cuff almost to shoulder) and seemingly overwrought that even the efforts of the gifted stylist Bill Mullen couldnt salvage the situation. There is only so much a person can do with a pheasant feather brooch.Guests included the actor Russell Tovey, now starring on Broadway in A View From the Bridge; the Bravo personality Andy Cohen; and the New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman. Each made a show of politely observing a procession of time-warp suits seemingly little altered from those Mr. Abboud designed in his 80s heyday.And Mr. Edelman, in particular, knitted his brows in rapt attention as models like Will Chalker or Sean OPry strode past wearing corduroy cargo pants or checkered suits with bellows vents, as simultaneously the eyes of certain other front-row regulars rolled back in their heads.The past can be a treacherous place in fashion, one of whose primary functions is to conjure an intensified present. It is one thing to make references to your own collection of priceless oldies, as does John Varvatos  a serious collector of vinyl. Just make sure the needle doesnt get stuck.The high-school debate team question Mr. Varvatos posed with the title of his show was Rock Is Dead? Like most moot rhetorical devices, you can argue that one any way you like. For arguments sake, though, lets say that holding a show in a designer shop that formerly housed the fabled rock dive CBGB, and serving invited guests smores as they wander through rooms decked out like a suburban house of horrors past models in cheetah print sweaters and shearling coats does not inspire confidence in the vitality of the genre.For all that, it was one of Mr. Varvatoss better recent collections, one that included slick shawl-collared sharkskin suits one could actually imagine certain rockers of an earlier era having worn  not the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin (both of which were played at deafening volume inside a space one wit referred to as Mens Scarehouse), but someone like James Chance, frontman for the long-forgotten 80s funk-noise band James White and the Blacks.It often happens that the best ideas in a designers latest collection were originally someone elses. File under: sincerest form of flattery. I call this the going-out-to-get-milk look, the designer Michael Kors said early Wednesday morning as he walked guests through a likable and commercially bulletproof presentation. While youre out, why not pick up a few ideas?The ribbed cashmere sweatpants Mr. Kors showed can be persuasively traced to any number of similar styles produced by Italian designers and shown recently at Pitti Uomo in Florence; the fanny pack and neck-hung mobile phone tote to Miuccia Prada; the lightweight sweatshirt-like jacket to a collection of down-filled coats sold as shirts by Comme des Garons about a decade ago. Fashion, lets face it, is no pure sphere.It sometimes also happens that the best ideas in a fashion show have precious little to do with design. That was the case at the shrewdly inventive show mounted Tuesday by Public School.There was plenty to praise about a collection that built on the genuine cool the designers Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow personally project with little apparent effort. The quilted nylon trousers, asymmetrically zippered navy blazers, textured wool pants, denim tunics and flat crown gunslinger Stetsons all riffed on the singular formula Public School devised for a new iteration of urban uniform.More compelling than the clothes, though, was the presentation, which took place at the ground floor of Milk Studios in the meatpacking district. The space itself had been bisected by curtains into dual zones. One was for the press and retailers. The other included a window-walled backstage area left visible to the street.Starting in the early morning hours, Public School followers tipped off on social media had lined up on behind barricades to secure good viewing spots. Thus when the time came for the show to begin, models like Robert Sipos, Adonis Bosso and Fernando Cabral strode straight out onto West 14th Street along an improvised sidewalk runway.Inverting the customary hierarchies of fashion, the designers kept the fashion insiders waiting while the kids on the street and the 150,000 others on Public Schools Instagram feed saw everything first."}
{"text": "The Driver(Capitol Nashville)For almost a decade, Charles Kelley has been the male anchor of Lady Antebellum, one of the most popular groups in country music and the one that has most assiduously pushed the genre toward soft-rock oblivion. At the groups best, it has made the highest, most refined sort of cheese, and Mr. Kelley  who has a lovely, smooth voice  has sounded like a soul singer staging a firm protest against everything going on around him.Maybe thats why theres a kind of Nashville fatigue hovering over The Driver, his first solo album. Two of its nine songs are about the secondary players that the spotlight often misses. The tepid title single, a collaboration with Eric Paslay and Dierks Bentley, celebrates the humble guy behind the wheel of the tour bus: first one in and the last rolling out. Leaving Nashville, which closes the album, is far more skeptical and abrasive: Pour out your heart in 3:20/The one you didnt write for the money/You turn it in, nobodys listening.This is a beautiful song about failure that in a less corporate time would seem romantic but nowadays just feels righteously angry. Mr. Kelley is laying the system bare  well, really, the songwriters Abe Stoklasa and Donovan Woods are  and presenting the country music machine as a dream killer, not a rainmaker: And your friends are friends with country stars/Yeah, theyre buying homes and here you are/Youre two months from living in your car.Mr. Kelley can do that, though, because hes never been an optimal fit for the genre. And on this pleasant but not especially challenging album, he relies on his strength, love songs in the key of blue-eyed soul: the elegantly aching I Wish You Were Here (with Miranda Lambert singing lovely harmony) and Lonely Girl, which shuffles with a kind of prim swagger. For years, Mr. Kelley has been engaged in an elaborate country-musical con game; finally, here, hes telling Nashville just what he thinks about it."}
{"text": "Filmmakers have known since at least 1983 that it takes more than snarling dogs to make a decent snarling-dog horror movie. Thats the year that Cujo, the film version of Stephen Kings novel, came out, and in addition to the fearsome title character, a deranged St. Bernard, it had a disintegrating marriage, a boy who was afraid of monsters, and more to help add interest.The lessons of 1983, though, are lost on the makers of The Pack, a dreary Australian movie, directed by Nick Robertson, that has more dogs than Cujo but noticeably less plot. After an ominous setup tells us that around the world, packs of wild dogs roam freely, killing at will, we meet a family of four (Jack Campbell and Anna Lise Phillips play the mom and dad) on a remote sheep farm. They keep finding their animals torn to pieces and are in danger of losing the farm, a possible plot enhancement that isnt developed before the dog pack inhabiting their land decides that humans might be tastier than livestock.The four are trapped on their property, and were trapped, waiting for something to happen other than the one fright  ominous silence, broken abruptly by a snarling dog  that the film turns to repeatedly. We learn nothing much about the family members except that outsmarting dogs doesnt seem to be their forte. Also not a forte of anyone involved in this project: originality in picking a name. The Pack was already used as the title of a 1977 movie about dogs run amok."}
{"text": "Theres an old phrase in Japanese, Toudai moto kurashi, which translates to the lighthouse does not shine on its base  that is, you can see everything around you except whats closest. Its a useful saying to keep in mind as, this week, the Japanese tech-art collective teamLab unveils its largest installation to date: 20 works inside 20,000 square feet. As the inaugural exhibition for Paces newly minted Art+Technology program, housed in the gallerys Menlo Park space, it places tech-based art directly in the heart of Silicon Valley  to completely surprising effect. We respect Silicon Valley exceedingly, but, as things are happening all the time, we arent paying it a lot of attention, says Toshiyuki Inoko, the collectives founder. TeamLab wants to contribute to mankind through a different role than Silicon Valley. The exhibition, titled Living Digital Space and Future Parks, aims to be a disruptor  and not in the tech-jargon sense, but rather more literally. We want to think about a new way for art to be, Inoko says. Not just works of art, but including everything: space, viewers, even the market.Its a big claim, but teamLabs digital works really do thwart the typical experience of viewing art  and leave a lasting impression. TeamLab, comprised of about 400 members (designers, engineers, artists and more), makes immersive art. But unlike the genres current celebrities James Turrell or Doug Wheeler, who use immersion as a vehicle for contemplation, teamLabs works are multi-channel orchestrations that involve light, sound, video, digital sequences and virtual-reality environments that amalgamate into a technological wonderland, all the while cemented in the realm of art. Marc Glimcher, Paces president, recalls the first time he saw a teamLab work, four or five years ago: I was like, This is not art, and realized I was having an authentic art experience, he says. Its something that we have to open up what our definition of art is, so I had my own conversion experience. While the collective has been on Paces roster since 2014, this exhibition, according to Glimcher, is unprecedented  in size, scale, impact and public interaction. The show also introduces two entirely new works  Light Sculpture of Flames, a preview of which is above, and Black Waves of Infinity  which build off other works included. By using the digital, we think that new art can not just expand art itself, but also change the way that space is treated in a museum or gallery, the way that people value art, Inoko says. (One notable divergence from a typical gallery show: You have to purchase tickets to get in.)The extension of the mind has become the focus for Silicon Valley; personal computers and smartphones are certainly extensions of the mind, Inoko notes. And in typical fashion, teamLab sees that as a challenge: In this case, an app thats not merely the headphones-in, space-out tour often found in similar settings accompanies the exhibition. For the piece Crystal Universe (above), comprising 50,000 LED lights, the app allows viewers to create differing star patterns and sequences within a 3-D light-and-space backdrop. It invokes what teamlab calls 4-D vision. By connecting digital technology and art, I think its possible to make other peoples existence more positive, Inoko says. Technology is humanitarian. The concept of the digital is to expand the expression of humanity. If that means believing in changing the value system, then maybe it is a form of faith."}
{"text": "In the late 1990s, the only place in New York City where I could find Hawaiian-style poke (poh-kay) was a fishmonger, now shuttered, on the Upper West Side.The guy behind the counter had a girlfriend who worked the Continental Airlines route from Newark to Honolulu. This blessed woman, whose name I never learned, brought back inamona, a paste made from the roasted, crushed hearts of kukui nuts, and poke mix: careful proportions of alaea salt (stained red by volcanic clay), dried limu (seaweed native to the islands) and chile.A tip of the ingredients over cubes of raw ahi, and time for the flavors to relax into each other: This was all that was required. The fishmonger offered the poke in plastic tubs, without ceremony, just as I had always known it in Honolulu, where I grew up and where some of the best poke is sold at a liquor store, Tamuras.Then, a few years back, poke started appearing on stray restaurant menus, sometimes identified as Hawaiian crudo or ceviche. (In Hawaiian, poke means to cut crosswise in pieces.) Now, almost all at once, Manhattan is home to three restaurants devoted to poke, in addition to a chef dealing poke out of a coffee shop that doubles as a karaoke bar.The first to open, in October, was Sons of Thunder in Murray Hill. It is also the best.The fish (ahi or salmon) is beautifully fresh and well cut, in hunks large enough to give a sense of plushness on the tongue. These may arrive under a gloss of shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) and sesame oil, with tracks of alaea salt and hijiki (seaweed), subtle and as essential as ligatures. Or a chile aioli whose slow-burn heat hums in the mouth without igniting it.Elsewhere in town, poke is typically heaped on a stark bed of rice. Here, each bowl ($7.50 to $10.75) is a terrarium of mesclun greens and seaweed salad, offsetting the richness of the fish, with a humbler cushion of rice half-hidden below. Elsewhere, I also found the white rice too clumpy, the brown rice too dry; at Sons of Thunder, both are commendably fluffy. Extras like crispy shards of garlic or a tinsel of nori add textural interest, but you dont need them.There is tako (octopus) poke, too, tender with just a touch of chewiness, as well as versions made with tofu or golden beets, which I thought sacrilegious until I tasted them. I still do not understand the miracle.Then again, James Kim, who shares duties in the kitchen with his younger brother, John, was once a pastor. (The restaurants name comes from the troublemaker apostles James and John, whom Jesus called sons of thunder.) The Kims are from Queens but have roots in Hawaii; their grandparents emigrated there from South Korea.The surfboard on the wall is Jamess, on leave from Lido Beach on Long Island. In the back is a dining room with a pretty skylight and little adornment beyond two large prints by the surf photographer Brian Bielmann, of tow-in boats at Teahupoo, in Tahiti, one of the worlds great breaks, and of tiny riders in a long peel of blue.Pokworks, which opened in January near Herald Square, is the first of a planned chain. (Another outlet is set to open in March in Mountain View, Calif., not far from Google headquarters.) The Manhattan location follows the assembly-line model, which occasionally results in skewed ratios, like an overdose of alaea salt in an otherwise appealing bowl of ahi with rust-red frills of ogo (seaweed).The menu ($10.50 to $12.95) is divided between house-composed signature works and a vertiginous list of build-it-yourself options, not all self-explanatory. This may exacerbate the discouraging line, which at peak lunch hour coils inside the narrow space and tumbles outside, almost rivaling the one at the nearby Chick-fil-A.The only place to sit is squashed on a stool at a brief counter, with customers-in-waiting breathing down your neck. Still, it is a relief in Midtown to be able to eat a light, healthy lunch that has genuine flavor and texture and doesnt feel like a sacrifice.Kevin Hsu, one of the owners and a native Californian, was inspired by the poke he ate on trips to Hawaii. But the recipes here go further afield, including chicken cooked sous-vide and slurred with a ginger-scallion sauce, a nod to Hainanese chicken; tofu dashed with Korean gochujang; and poke burritos.I dont like my poke too crowded. So I preferred the Umami Classic, a straightforward sum of ahi, sesame oil and shoyu bolstered by a house-made dashi stock, over rice.A third contender, Wisefish Pok in Chelsea, is so new  it opened at the end of January  I can offer only first impressions.The room is too skinny to comfortably fit the poke pilgrims already thronging here, but its lovely, more personal in feel than franchisable, outfitted in exposed brick, mosaic tile and a communal table with a stripe of succulents down the center. Bowl options ($7.95 to $13.95) include a demure snack size, which makes sense to me, since in Hawaii poke is often an appetizer or side dish.I tried all the house favorites on the menu, tosses of ahi, salmon or tofu with different sauces and toppings, assembled to order with remarkable good cheer; the owners, Drew Crane and Bryan Cowan, have got the aloha spirit part right. I wished for a little less rice and a little more fish, and some oomph. But the Hawaii Style, ahi shining with shoyu and sesame oil, earned its name.Meanwhile, with less fanfare, a couple of vendors have been selling poke at outdoor markets: PokOno, run by Andrew Danieli and Deborah Chung, who plan to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant this year, and East Coast Pok, started by Brooklyn-born Alfred DiMartini, a former line cook at Lupa and Bouley.Since November, Mr. DiMartini has been working out of the Coffee Foundry in Greenwich Village. Ostensibly he serves poke Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., but his shipments of fish from Hawaii dont always arrive or meet his standards, so its safer to call ahead.He makes fine, honest poke, without too many complications: bowls ($12) of ahi steeped in shoyu, sesame oil, alaea salt and wakame or sriracha aioli. A staccato of black and white sesame seeds goes on top; below, sticky rice laced with rice vinegar and crushed pineapple (but not too much).At the bottom of the menu is Spam musubi, the blushing pink canned-meat product pressed between slabs of rice. In Hawaii, this, too, is beloved. Im still waiting for it to hit the big time."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  President Obama on Wednesday embraced Muslims in the United States as part of one American family and implicitly criticized the Republican presidential candidates in a warning to citizens to not be bystanders to bigotry.In a visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore, his first to a mosque in the United States as president, Mr. Obama recited phrases from the Quran and praised American Muslims as a crucial part of Americas history and vital to the nations future.And so if were serious about freedom of religion  and Im speaking now to my fellow Christians who remain the majority in this country  we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths, Mr. Obama said.Although Mr. Obama never mentioned Republican presidential candidates like Donald J. Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, the targets in his remarks were clear. We have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion, he said.The speech served as a bookend to a 2009 address Mr. Obama delivered at Cairo University, where he called for a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world. In Baltimore, the president did not talk about intractable international conflicts like the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and focused instead on the more prosaic reality of vandalized mosques and bullied American Muslim children.These children are just like mine, Mr. Obama said. And the notion that they would be filled with doubt and questioning their places in this great country of ours at a time when theyve got enough to worry about  its hard being a teenager already  thats not who we are.Although President George W. Bush visited a mosque in Washington within six days of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to reassure American Muslims, Mr. Obama, a Christian, brushed aside requests for a visit for years in part because 43 percent of Republicans and 29 percent of Americans think he is a Muslim, according to a CNN/ORC poll last September. Aides feared a mosque visit would feed into that perception.But in the final year of his presidency, Mr. Obama has lost much of his reticence in addressing issues like race, addiction and religion, often in very personal terms. Administration officials said there had been little internal debate about Mr. Obama visiting an American mosque since talk about it began at the White House last fall.In an aside that drew considerable laughter, Mr. Obama told the crowd at the mosque that controversy over a presidents religion is not new. By the way, Thomas Jeffersons opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim  so I was not the first, he said, adding: Im in good company.For Mr. Obama, the remarks were also an admission of how little progress has been made since the speech in Cairo, where he called for a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground. In his speech on Wednesday, he suggested that his hopes for a reconciliation had been dashed, but he called on all Americans to stick by the countrys founding ideals.Muslims in the audience hailed the address.I think it was one of the best speeches hes ever given, said Representative Andr Carson, an Indiana Democrat. Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, said the speech hit me in the heart and was a vital antidote to growing intolerance.I have a 19-year-old daughter who is a Muslim and wants to contribute to her nation, and it bugs me that someone who says he wants to be president would want to exclude her, Mr. Ellison said.But Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, one of the countrys oldest and largest pro-Israel organizations, denounced Mr. Obama for visiting a mosque whose leaders, Mr. Klein said, have among other issues criticized Israeli military actions. Going to such a mosque only encourages radical Muslims to harm Americans, Mr. Klein said.White House and Islamic Society of Baltimore officials did not respond to Mr. Kleins criticism. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that any mosque would have been attacked similarly.Concerns about Muslims and Syrian refugees in the United States grew after terrorist attacks in Paris in November claimed the lives of 130 people and after a mass shooting by a husband-and-wife team in San Bernardino, Calif., in December left 14 people dead and 22 seriously wounded.Since then, attacks on American Muslims and mosques have spiked, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. At a meeting at the White House last month, prominent American Muslims pleaded with senior administration officials to have the president visit a mosque in the hope of stemming such attacks.A portion of Mr. Obamas speech in Baltimore was a kind of primer, in which he offered some basic facts on Islam and the United States that he said the news media had failed to communicate.Among those facts: Islam is a religion of peace. Some of the earliest Americans were Muslim. Jefferson and other founding fathers sought to guarantee the freedom of Muslims to worship. Muslims are everywhere in American society as doctors, teachers, soldiers and sports stars.Mr. Obama said that too many Americans heard about Islam only after terrorist attacks, and that this must change. Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security, he said. Its not that hard to do. There was a time when there were no black people on television.Mr. Obama also said that anyone who suggested that the United States was at war with Islam not only legitimized such groups as the Islamic State but also played into their hands. That kind of mind-set helps our enemies, he said. It helps our enemies recruit. It makes us all less safe.Doris Kearns Goodwin, a presidential scholar, likened Mr. Obamas visit and warnings against anti-Muslim language to warnings made by two other presidents at the end of their terms.George Washington warned his countrymen against the increasing power of factions which kindle animosity of one against the other, while Eisenhower warned against the unwarranted influence of the military industrial complex, she wrote in an email.Mr. Obama ended his speech by reminding Muslim Americans, You are not alone, your fellow Americans stand with you. And he reminded others that the countrys diversity is not a weakness, that is one of our greatest strengths.We are one American family, he said. We will rise and fall together."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Two photographers living in China, Kevin Frayer of Getty Images and Fred Dufour of Agence France-Presse, set up a collective Instagram account in June that displays photographs and short videos taken across China. They called it Eyes on China.The aim was to provide an informal outlet and organizing point for many of the professional photographers, both Chinese and foreign, working in the country. The account now has 34 photographers, 18 of them Chinese and 16 foreign. A couple are video journalists.China is a massive, complicated and incredibly interesting place that is impossible for any one photographer to show, Mr. Frayer said. Our goal was to pull together this large group of talented photographers and video journalists to give people a diverse and ongoing visual document of the country.As seen here, the images are wide-ranging and offer a glimpse into ordinary lives across China. An old man sits atop a traditional bed known as a kang. A woman stands in a snowstorm. A bride prepares for a wedding portrait by a lake.Eyes on China has more than 30,000 followers. It is not known how many are living in China as Instagram, like many other prominent social networks, is blocked in the country.Using social media is a wonderful way to reach a large audience and to create a following, Mr. Frayer said. The irony of course is that Instagram is blocked in mainland China. The project has not yet had any official support from Instagram  such as being highlighted on Instagrams feed or being designated as a suggested follow  but we are thrilled by the large support base and following that we have built. Its organic.There are very few rules for posting, Mr. Frayer said, and each contributor selects his or her own images.Two regular freelance photographers for The New York Times, Gilles Sabri and Sim Chi Yin, contribute to Eyes on China, as does Jonah M. Kessel, a video journalist for The Times."}
{"text": "Some characters die hard. For some TV viewers, Wentworth Miller will forever be Michael J. Scofield of Prison Break, a structural engineer determined to spring his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), from a penitentiary with the help of blueprints tattooed on his own upper body.Later Mr. Miller broke free from one indelible character by playing another: Captain Cold, the DC Comics master thief on CWs The Flash. Playing Captain Cold is probably the most fun Ive had as an actor because not only is he a bad guy, but hes got edge, a sense of humor, Mr. Miller said. Hes not responsible for doing the expositional heavy lifting. Hes kind of a spice character: he comes in, does a little dance and then exits.Now comes DCs Legends of Tomorrow, in which Mr. Millers baddie has been co-opted  along with characters like the Canary, the Atom, Hawkgirl and Heat Wave, played by Mr. Purcell  to prevent Vandal Savage from annihilating the Earth.So the question becomes, now that were spending more time with Captain Cold, what else is there? Mr. Miller said of his character.Viewers will learn more in Thursdays episode, which unfurls the frozen-hearted villains back story. On a recent visit to The New York Times, Mr. Miller discussed his own evolution, including his creative partnership with Mr. Purcell and plans for a Prison Break revival. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.Q. So, is Captain Cold on his way to becoming a hero?A. Hes probably a legend in his own mind already, but hero status  he probably perceives that as something out of his reach, because hes been a villain, hes done some not so great things. But through the course of this adventure, with the stakes being what they are  saving mankind  its conceivable that redemption and wiping the slate clean are possible, even for someone like Captain Cold.You and Dominic Purcell are partners in Legends, but you interacted on The Flash as well. How did that happen?My first episode of The Flash, the producers came to me and said, Were trying to hire another actor to play this character Heat Wave, and you two are like Frick and Frack, Mutt and Jeff. Hes the brawn to your brains. And were looking for someone whos a force of nature, a real presence.And Dominic Purcell was the first  and only  name out of my mouth. Were like salt and pepper shakers, were like a matched set. When Im working with Dominic, theres an ease and understanding because I know what he wants from a scene, and I know that he knows what I want from a scene. So well tend to work a lot faster than another pair of actors.After Prison Break ended in 2009, you stopped acting for a while and wrote the screenplay for Stoker. Why the hiatus from acting?Working on a one-hour drama is probably one of the more challenging jobs in the business. And at the end of Prison Break, I was exhausted. I needed a timeout for personal and professional reasons, and I started writing and discovered that I had a facility for it. That was my focus for three or four years, but theres a certain bond that happens when youre in the trenches with the cast and crew, grinding out great TV week in, week out, that I found I missed.Youll be shooting a Prison Break reboot soon. How did that come about?When Dominic and I got together again for The Flash, I hadnt seen him for five years, but it was like no time had passed. And out of that experience came the idea to approach Fox and see what their level of interest might be in a where-are-they-now limited series. They were on board.I think everyone involved is really committed to respecting the existing mythology and making sure this new chapter deepens that, up to and including answering some of the questions left at the end of the original series that I know I have and I know the audience has. Like, is Michael still alive, and if so, how?Can you give us a hint?[Laughs.] I cant confirm or deny.A lot of people in the building are craning their necks today as you walk by. What are some of the pressures associated with becoming  and staying  a sex symbol?I try not to feed that particular fire. I am all for the salt and pepper in my hair. I am all about stepping into my inner elder and honoring the fact that Im a man of a certain age with all that experience behind me, and that shows up in my walk and my talk and my face. And thats something to be embraced.Youve spoken and written about your experience with depression and, when you were younger, feelings of suicide, and subsequent coping mechanisms.It is something that is near and dear to me. Ive walked a long road and have struggled with depression on and off for decades, and making sure that I continue to vibrate at the right frequency is my priority. And that looks like having a self-care routine in place that includes meditation and exercise and prayer and a good nights sleep and diet and writing and sitting in a circle with a group of men like the Mankind Project.Culturally, theres a wall of silence that we create because we dont know how to have that conversation yet, because that requires building a vocabulary we dont have. Meanwhile, people are suffering and people are dying. Its within our best interest to figure out what that conversation looks like and to have it openly and publicly without shame as quickly as possible  because if its not you, its someone you know.You also publicly came out as gay in 2013. Why did you wait so long?It felt like I was doing what I had to do at the time. I dont think I could have done it any differently. There is a part of me that at 43 looks back at the window of opportunity and thinks, gee, wouldnt it have been great if youd been able to come out while Prison Break was on the air and at the height of the shows popularity? But I wasnt ready emotionally, spiritually. When I was a younger man, my career was very important to me, my life as an artist was very important to me. I had visions of things I wanted to have and do and achieve.Now I put community first and family first and friends first. And I had an epiphany before the Legends opportunity came about, which was, when I die and Im seated at the foot of my maker, whoever he or she may be, you know what were not going to be talking about? Ratings, my IMDB page, magazine covers, award shows. What well be talking about, I imagine, is my growth as a man and a soul, and my career is a part of that, but its just a piece of the puzzle. Its not the puzzle itself."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Contrary to Climate Pact Put to Test by Drop in Price of Oil (front page, Jan. 26), todays low oil prices pose little risk to the continued rapid scale-up of clean energy in the United States. Because only 1 percent of United States electricity comes from burning oil, oil prices dont affect the rapid growth of renewable power and energy-efficiency improvements on our electricity grid.Indeed, in 2015 wind and solar power projects provided more than half of the new electricity capacity built in the United States. On the transportation side, the strong fuel economy standards put in place by the Obama administration continue to drive fuel efficiency forward.And despite a 70 percent decline in oil prices, sales of electric cars have remained steady, and vehicle miles driven over the last year increased by less than 5 percent.Americans continue to demand clean energy, understanding that when we take into account the full costs of the harm and hazards that oil imposes on our environment and health, it is not cheap  at any price.KIT KENNEDYROLAND HWANGNew YorkThe writers are directors of the Energy and Transportation Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council."}
{"text": "For Eva Gdel, the owner and founder of Dsseldorf-based model agency Tomorrow Is Another Day, model-scouting is more than just a job. The thing is, Im always looking everywhere, she says. In the middle of the shopping street, I can stand there for eight hours and just look. The more people, the better for me. Some of my best boys I found when I was driving in my car!In the 15 years she has been running the agency, Gdel has launched the careers of dozens of young men from all over Europe and cast hundreds of runway shows for fashion houses including Alexander McQueen, Lanvin, Rick Owens and Raf Simons. She works frequently with photographers like Willy Vanderperre and the stylists Robbie Spencer and Alister Mackie; her models appear in some of the most highly sought-after editorials and campaigns of the season. In the process, she has been fundamental in a seismic shift in the field of male modeling  an industry that has, in the last few years, seen muscled Adonises replaced by a more individual  and less than conventional  aesthetic.Eva really was the first to legitimize the idea of running an agency that focuses on street-cast models, says Spencer, who is also the creative director of Dazed magazine. Evas focus is always on real people, not fantasy, and I think that approach is really special. A self-confessed Luddite, Gdel eschews social media for casting. I never do it, she says, acknowledging that its become an industry-wide norm to cast models from Instagram (this season, Gosha Rubchinskiy sourced diverse models from around the globe  on Instagram). Honestly, what I like about my job is when I have the time to go outside and watch people and see them, or go to a concert and watch what the people are doing. I think I need to see how someone lives. I dont think I can see it from a photo. I must see how they move and how they talk and how they are. Its more of a spirit around them for me.Growing up in Cologne, Gdel, 39, would tear pages from i-D and Dazed and paste them on her walls, citing the controversial CK One ads by Steven Meisel, old Helmut Lang campaigns and a 1992 exhibition by Larry Clark as strong influences in her work. At the age of 17, she started working in a shop, Made In, where she decorated the walls of the store with Polaroids of the customers. It was there that she discovered her knack for casting. Her first model agency, Nine Daughters and a Stereo  which she co-founded with Kira Bunse in 2001 grew out of a final thesis for a graphic design course she was taking at the time. It was not meant to be a business. I just did it in a way that I could photograph the people that I saw as interesting and that I thought could be cool, she says.In the early 2000s, cool came to be defined by the work of Hedi Slimane, then the creative director at Dior Homme, and Raf Simons  both of whom were deeply embedded in youth culture and experimenting with mens fashion and a skinnier silhouette. It felt more relevant to us, says Gdel of the influence of these two lodestars, both of whom fittingly choose to collaborate with her agency. After she formed Tomorrow Is Another Day in 2010, Gdels cast of skater kids and beautiful nonconformists  pale, skinny, sometimes tattooed  came to personify this new attitude in mens wear. When I started, those kind of boys didnt exist, she recalls. In the first year, I only booked them for Raf  he would come to Cologne and he always found all of the boys I found on the street interesting. Then other people started picking up this look and liking it, and so it went on.A potent antidote to the bland mainstream then, the men (and, now, a few women) on the roster of Tomorrow Is Another Day include some of the buzziest names of the moment: Artur Chruszcz, who was featured in the fall campaigns for Prada and Raf Simons, the elegant, Indian-born model Yusuf Siddiqui  a favorite of the emerging designer Grace Wales Bonner  and the more classically chiseled Andrew Westermann, who appeared in campaigns for Louis Vuitton and Hugo Boss. The 19-year-old mop-topped Paul Hameline, a Parisian punk kid who Gdel discovered in 2014 on his way to exams, is also on the roster. I got scouted five times before, but it never appealed to me, says Hameline, who also assists the stylist Lotta Volkova. But when Eva asked me, theres something that made me wanna give it a shot, and Im pretty certain that if it hadnt been with her, that I would have tired of it, he said, echoing a common thread among the models who see Gdel as much as a maternal figure as well as friend, confidante and mentor. Most of us are in it for the experience rather than seeing it as a career, says Jonas Gler, who walked exclusively for Prada in its recent mens fall/winter 2016 show in Milan. Thats why were the most fun and definitely the most diverse agency. Everybody seems to bring something completely different to the table, and just being around each other encourages us to express ourselves freely. Spencer agrees: I think her honesty and concern for the boys she meets and represents is what really makes her stand out and makes Tomorrow Is Another Day seem like no other agency. For Eva I think it is more about a family of people.Family can, of course, bring its own dysfunctions. Last season the agency was in the headlines when the German model Jera (previously a muse to Owens) displayed a banner while walking at his spring/summer 2016 show declaring Please Kill Angela Merkel  Not  a move that prompted Owens to punch him in the face after the show. Gdel immediately dropped Jera from the agency. Now, she grimaces at the memory of it. In the end, Im very sad at what Jera did, she says. Ive had him in the agency since my diploma, but he was always only working for Rick because he was really the face of the collection. I never booked him for anything else. I always told Rick, If you book him, its on your risk. Still, it was really sad that he took it too far. I never thought that he would ruin it that way.While she has no plans to expand her operations beyond its base in Dsseldorf, she extols the virtues of looking farther afield. What I would like to do is take more time to travel to more cities and find people there. While her search for beauty is constant, she acknowledges the ephemeral nature of her job. I think sometimes there is a temporary thing about beauty. There are some boys who have been with me since the beginning, and then there are boys where its only about a short time. They are just right at that moment. It doesnt last, and that makes it so beautiful."}

Almost double, in fact.The Sanders campaign is outspending Mrs. Clintons team in the New Hampshire media market, with about $1.3 million in paid advertising time and reservations for the week after the Iowa caucuses. The Clinton campaign has spent about $580,000 in paid advertising and reservations.One reason for the discrepancy: The Sanders campaign has dedicated more than half its budget for this week to the Boston media market. It is the most expensive of the four markets serving New Hampshire (the others are Manchester, N.H.; Portland, Me.; and Burlington, Vt.).And it is also the biggest market in Massachusetts, which votes on March 1 as part of Super Tuesday and is a prime target for the Sanders campaign.Were making an investment in a March 1st state, said Tad Devine, a senior strategist with the Sanders campaign. Were running against someone who won that state against Barack Obama in 2008.As of November, the most recent poll from The Boston Globe had Mrs. Clinton with a 25-point lead, 54 percent to 29 percent, over Mr. Sanders among likely Democratic voters in Massachusetts.Mrs. Clinton hasnt been silent on advertising. Just this week she aired two new ads in Las Vegas and one in South Carolina.Mrs. Clintons campaign didnt immediately respond to requests for comment."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Companies in the service industry grew in January at the slowest rate in nearly two years, a survey released on Wednesday said, raising concern that global economic challenges may be starting to affect consumers.A separate survey by the payroll processing firm ADP showed that companies added a solid 205,000 jobs last month, lifted by robust gains in services and construction.The Institute for Supply Management said that its services index fell to 53.5 last month from 55.8 in December. The January figure was the lowest since February 2014, when it was 52.6. Still, any reading above 50 signals that services companies are expanding.Its a little bit of a cooling off, said Anthony Nieves, chairman of the ISM nonmanufacturing business survey committee. As long as were staying above the 50 baseline, things are still going in the right direction.The economy is off to a rocky start in 2016. Stocks have plunged. Manufacturing activity fell in January for the fourth consecutive month. Economic growth in the United States slowed sharply in the final months of 2015. China, Japan, Europe and Brazil face more immediate financial challenges.Still, the services sector has been a source of stability. The ISM index has been expanding for the last six years, its gains dovetailing with the recovery from the recession.The majority of respondents to the survey for the services index were positive about business conditions. But they expressed concern about the global economy and the turbulent stock market eroding consumer confidence.The services survey showed continued but slower growth for business activity, new orders and employment.The ADP report said Wednesday that financial services, retailers and professional services companies also hired at a steady pace. The figures suggest that companies focused on the domestic economy remain healthy, despite gyrations in the financial markets and slowing global growth.Manufacturers have suffered from the strong dollar, which makes American goods more expensive overseas, and they did not add any jobs last month.All this turmoil in financial markets hasnt done any damage yet that I can see, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics, said. That is a very good sign. Moodys helps compile the ADP data.The data comes just two days before the governments official jobs report for January. Economists forecast that the report will show that employers added 200,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent.The ADP survey covers only private businesses and frequently diverges from the official figures.Still, the data suggests that layoffs and weak hiring are confined to the oil and gas drilling and manufacturing industries."}

{"text": "Convenience store snacks and the reverberations of a national tragedy are fodder for The Wedge Horse, Nick Gandiellos affecting if overwrought drama for Fault Line Theater. During the winter of 2003, Maddy (Ali Rose Dachis), her brother Bobby (Charlie Thurston) and their friend Los (Jorge Elizar Chacn) meet on a decrepit Long Island Railroad platform to discuss Sour Patch Kids, life and fate.Two years earlier, Maddy and Bobbys older brother died on Sept. 11, and now they cant decide how best to honor his memory. Neither can their increasingly estranged parents. A burgeoning romance between Maddy and Los further strains the siblings relationship.Mr. Gandiello has a fine sense of rhythm and an avowed love of hip-hop. None of these characters are especially articulate, but the playwright generously shares his irrepressible devotion to language. Los accuses Bobby of running off during a fight and says, I saw you off to the side, spectating, like a spectator. You scampering, son? You spectating? You can hear his satisfaction in making the accusation with such specificity, such sibilance.But the pleasure of individual lines isnt quite enough to sustain this piece, which, under Aaron Rossinis somewhat heavy-handed direction, tends to labor for significance. Theres hardly a sentence that isnt emphasized, a gesture allowed to remain casual. The scene in which Maddy explains the plays title and central metaphor is the dramatic equivalent of a neon highlighter run amok. The actors are most likely skilled, but theyre spurred so relentlessly toward such high intensity that its hard to tell.Mr. Gandiello and Mr. Rossini should have a little more faith in these characters and their voices. Had the scenes been allowed to progress more naturally, had some of the conversations not exploded into arguments, this might have been quite a ride."}
{"text": "Hillary Clinton raised substantially less for her presidential campaign in January than her Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, according to an unofficial tally Mrs. Clinton released on Thursday. The totals provide something of a psychological, as well as a financial, boost for Mr. Sanders and his supporters as he seeks to defeat Mrs. Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton raised $15 million in January, while Mr. Sanders raised $20 million. Mrs. Clinton also raised another $5 million in joint efforts with the Democratic National Committee. But while that money will aid Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee, it is unavailable to her during the nominating battle.While full details will not be available until both candidates file quarterly fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission in April, the advantage for Mr. Sanders underscores how the fiery liberal senator has rewritten the rules of large-scale presidential fund-raising. Virtually all of his cash has come from grass-roots donors giving less than $200, whereas Mrs. Clinton has assembled a more traditional fund-raising operation that relies more heavily on wealthy bundlers and donors giving the maximum of $2,700.Mr. Sanders has now raised more money in total than any candidate except Mrs. Clinton herself.

{"text": "The last time Joel and Ethan Coen dropped by Hollywood, they nearly burned the place down.In their gleefully bilious 1991 comedy, Barton Fink, John Turturro plays the title sap, a New York playwright who goes west to work for Capitol Pictures, where his Louis B. Mayer-like boss insists straight-faced that the writer is king! Its a cruel joke, one that the Coens play out as Barton is engulfed in flames and madness. As apocalyptic as a Nathanael West hallucination, Barton Fink felt like the testament of two filmmakers who, however much they loved movies, were happy to torch the industry. Yet here they are in Hail, Caesar!, back on the lot and cracking jokes.If this were anyone other than the Coens you might think that success and a couple of Oscars had mellowed them. Not likely. Hail, Caesar! is one of those diversions that they turn out in between masterworks and duds. Its a typically sly, off-center comedy, once again set against the machinery of the motion-picture business. And, as usual with the Coens, it has more going on than there might seem, including in its wrangling over God and ideology, art and entertainment. Some of it is familiar and satisfyingly funny, even if there are laughs and bits that seem as if they were written to amuse only the Coens and the Turner Classic Movies crowd. (Love the Loretta Young nod!)As the Coens have done in the past, they use an unseen narrator (Michael Gambon), who gives the movie a slight fairy-tale vibe, announcing that were not in Kansas or anywhere like life. Instead its once upon a time in Tinseltown in the 1950s, the decade after Barton Finks meltdown. The studio is again Capitol, but here the focus is a suit, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a front-office true believer and a devout Roman Catholic. As tightly wound as the watch he regularly checks, Mannix makes problems disappear before they become headaches or scandal-sheet headlines. Hes a pit bull in a fedora, but his loyalty to the studio suggests that hes either an idealist or a fanatic. So what is he?Hes playing a role, for starters, much like the stable of stars and extras under his wing. Like some other Coen creations, he shares a name with a real person, Eddie Mannix, a behind-the-scenes fixer who worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when it claimed to have more stars than there are in heaven. From the mid-1920s on, Mannix prowled that studio, serving as Louis B. Mayers trusted aide and the studios go-between with the unions; he even greenlighted films. He pops up dealing and scheming in some of the sleazier, less reliable Hollywood histories, but in Hail, Caesar! hes a straight arrow and effectively an executive suite of one  the only big shot on the lot.The Coens like to open their movies with a question mark  the spurious truth claims in Fargo, the tumbling tumbleweeds in The Big Lebowski, the Old World shtetl in A Serious Man  which suits their playfully layered, sideways storytelling. (Theyre masters of the narrative tease.) Both blunt and opaque, the first image in Hail, Caesar! is of a large crucifix in a church where Mannix, clutching a rosary, is bowed in prayer and soon making the first of his confession-box appearances. Grimacing, he comes across as a man with far more on his mind than spiritual matters; Mr. Brolins large, magnificently sculptural head has rarely looked heavier.In their circuitous way, the Coens get around to sketching in a story with the kidnapping of a major Capitol star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), whos nearing the end of production on one of its big prestige pictures. Also titled Hail, Caesar!, it looks and sounds like one of those dopily sincere religious spectacles that the studios never tire of. (In a Coen-esque flourish, it appears at least partly modeled on the 1959 epic Ben-Hur, in which a lock-jawed Charlton Heston, a few years after parting the Red Sea, plays a Jewish prince turned Roman slave turned charioteer who has a life-changing encounter with Jesus.) Whitlocks kidnapping stirs up turmoil and mystery  the snatchers portentously call themselves the Future  which leads to Mannix playing shamus as he tries to get back his star.At first, the kidnapping seems like an excuse for the Coens to fool around with genre and, as they like to do, riff on classical Hollywood form and style. Usefully, the kidnapping gets Mannix out of his office and onto the set, including a soundstage where a song-and-dance man in a sailor suit, Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), makes like a randy Gene Kelly. Mr. Tatums number is delightful, at once satirical and virtuosic, although the winking bawdiness of the choreography is more risqu than what would have been allowed in a real 1950s musical. Here, as elsewhere, the Coens are scratching off the glossy studio veneer to show what lies beneath, including unspoken desires, even as theyre also putting on the kind of good show that helped build MGM.In its shape, Hail, Caesar! at times brings to mind one of those old plot-free film revues that featured a grab bag of studio talent performing in strung-together musical, comic and dramatic scenes. Among the other marquee names Mannix handles are DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an aquatic star who enters with a snarl and an Esther Williams splash, and a singing cowboy, Hobie Doyle (a charming Alden Ehrenreich), who goes from trick riding to wearing a tuxedo amid a froth of satiny gowns and Mid-Atlantic accents. Its a rough transition, especially for Hobies director, Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes, perfection), who tries to squeeze the drawl out of the cowboy in an elocution lesson that makes for a very funny duet and illustrates Hollywood magic at its dissembling best.The clock may be ticking for Whitlock, but the Coens are not in any great rush to see him rescued. Theyre more interested in meandering in and around their dream factory, in showing DeeAnna wiggling underwater in a mermaid costume and Hobie doing a headstand in a saddle. Like all the performers at Capitol, these two prove supremely good at their jobs, which feels almost sentimental for the Coens but is also an acknowledgment of the old film factorys brilliance. Even Whitlock, a high-wattage dim bulb, delivers the goods, as does Mr. Clooney, who paints the purloined actor in 50 shades of smiling idiocy. Whitlock is a boob; hes also a great Hollywood star.No one, though, is more competent than Mannix, who in his looks, loyalty and especially his piety is finally the biggest fantasy figure on screen: the studio executive as a man of virtue. For all his church prayers, Mannixs faith is invested in Capitol. Hes an embodiment of the industrys self-delusion and self-mythology, the kind of executive who invokes vision and bullies the help. In this, he makes a sly contrast with some Communist screenwriters who are true believers of a different stripe. Their discussions about art and dialectics mirror a side-splitter of a scene in which Mannix consults with four religious leaders about the studios depiction of Jesus. As it turns out, everyone has something to peddle  a talent, an angle, a god  and, truly, thats entertainment.Hail, Caesar! is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The usual Hollywood high jinks, dames and drama. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes."}
{"text": "Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, both ended their presidential campaigns on Wednesday, as the fallout from the Iowa caucuses continued to winnow the Republican field.Mr. Paul, whose once popular message of resistance to government surveillance and foreign intervention fell out of fashion amid growing anxieties about terrorism, dropped out of the race after a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses on Monday.And Mr. Santorum, who failed to recapture the energy and enthusiasm that turned him into a serious challenger to Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination in 2012, announced the end of his own campaign on Wednesday evening on Fox News and endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.In his endorsement of Mr. Rubio, Mr. Santorum said he could more effectively fight for the key issues of his campaign by throwing his support behind a better positioned candidate who shares the values we believe in and who can benefit those who are struggling on the margins.Mr. Santorum, 57, finished near the bottom of the field in Iowa, with just 1 percent of the vote.In a statement, Mr. Paul, 53, said that while his campaign was over, he remained ready to fight for the cause of liberty.He added: Across the country, thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy. Brush fires of liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I.Mr. Paul earned just 4.5 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses, a discouraging finish for someone who, only a year earlier, had seemed poised to make a real run at the White House.Though sometimes irascible, Mr. Paul seemed to offer an inclusive vision for the Republican Party, working across the aisle on issues like an overhaul of the criminal justice system and visiting places not typically trafficked by Republicans  urban centers, liberal-leaning college campuses  to present his views. He also inherited the libertarian streak of his father, former Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who ran for president several times, including in 2008 and 2012.Mr. Santorum won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, running his campaign on a shoestring budget. His hard-line conservative stances, like opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion rights, helped endear him to the states deeply religious voters.In this campaign, as in 2012, Mr. Santorum completed the Full Grassley  visiting all of Iowas 99 counties, in a feat named after the states Republican senior senator, Charles E. Grassley  but he could not recreate his previous momentum.Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, and Martin OMalley, the former Democratic governor of Maryland, suspended their campaigns on Monday night after disappointing Iowa performances."}
{"text": "Its rare for a politician to be overshadowed in victory, and even rarer when that victory is actually an upset. But Ted Cruz managed that trick in Iowa: Despite pulling out a victory when almost everyone expected Donald J. Trump to win, he found himself overshadowed twice in the coverage that followed first by Trumps unexpected flop, and second by Marco Rubios unexpectedly strong third-place finish.It was the same in the prediction markets. On Feb. 1, just before Iowa voted, Trump was given (absurdly) a 50 percent chance of winning the Republican nomination by bettors, and Rubio a 35 percent chance. No sooner had the Iowa results come in than the two men switched places  a vertiginous plunge for Trump, a leap upward for Rubio.As for the man who actually won the caucuses? His odds ticked up  from 8 percent to 14 percent.Why the lack of respect for Cruz? Its true that he isnt the first candidate to ride strong evangelical support to victory in Iowa, and the track records of Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee dont exactly inspire confidence. Its true that hes widely despised by his own partys leadership, to a degree that some Republican machers might even prefer living dangerously with Trump to nominating Cruz. And its true that his record and reputation make him a significant general election gamble, in a party that hasnt taken that kind of risk since Barry Goldwater.But if Cruzs weaknesses were good reasons to give him low odds when this whole process started, they arent good reasons anymore. In a field thats fluid and shrinking, he may not be the absolute favorite, but his path to the nomination is as plausible as anybody elses at this point.First, he isnt Huckabee or Santorum. They were true insurgents, desperately underfunded candidates who staked everything on Iowa and then lacked a plan to follow through. Cruz has the money and the organization that they lacked, and notwithstanding his Duck Dynasty endorsement and Senate enemies, he has a network of elite support that can carry him through a long campaign.Second, the calendar promises him momentum. South Carolina is a good state for him, and then the large so-called S.E.C. primary looms on March 1, rich in evangelical votes. The S.E.C. states arent winner take all, so Cruz cant build an insurmountable delegate lead even if he runs the table. But on the morning of March 2, the media may start covering him as if hes the front-runner.Third, hes already consolidated most of the constituency he needs to go deep into the campaign. Rand Pauls departure, in particular, is a reminder of how effectively Cruz had already cut into his libertarian, anti-Washington and anti-interventionist base. Rubio hasnt yet done the same to Jeb Bush and the rest of the center-right pack: His Iowa finish helps, but unlike Cruz, he needs to prove something in New Hampshire to start pushing major rivals out of the race.Then finally, if Rubio does consolidate support, Cruz has clear lines of attack against him. The waters have been muddied a bit on immigration, but the Florida senator will always be an architect of the Gang of Eight bill, and the Texas senator will always have opposed it. On foreign policy, too, Cruzs Jacksonian, bomb em all positioning on the Middle East seems more in tune with the partys post-Iraq war mood than Rubios tendency toward a George W. Bush-style crusading idealism.Now, of course, Cruz has all kinds of weaknesses as well  more than a few of which were on display in his rambling, preening, melodramatic victory speech on Monday night. Hes unloved by the press, which matters even in a Republican primary. Hes less personally charismatic and almost certainly a tougher general-election sell than Rubio. His tax plan, which would raise the cost of living significantly for seniors, is vulnerable to potentially devastating attacks. If it came down to a two-man race, he would probably lose big in the late, blue, winner-take-all states, potentially overwhelming whatever delegate lead hed accumulated up to that point.But as you may have heard, this isnt a two-man race. Trump still prowls the stage, Trump still leads New Hampshire, and its Trump who may ultimately hold the key to Cruzs hopes.The Donalds support, so far as pollsters can tell, is concentrated in an arc that runs from the Deep South through the Rust Belt and into the Northeast. So the ideal scenario for the Texas senator involves Trump underperforming in the old Confederacy, but staying strong enough in bluer states to deny some of them to Rubio (or any other establishment-friendly candidate).That scenario might run like this. First, Trump wins pretty easily in New Hampshire, putting to rest the possibility that this will collapse quickly into a Cruz-Rubio battle. Then, the real estate mogul fades just enough that he doesnt take too many Southern delegates from Cruz during the S.E.C. primary, but doesnt fade so much that hes in any way tempted to drop out.Then as the race moves to states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and New York, Trump keeps winning a lot of working-class moderates and secular voters, enough to either take some of those states for himself or let Cruz steal a couple of blue-state wins with only 35 or 40 percent of the vote.Right now, admittedly, Trump doesnt seem inclined to cooperate with this script. Hes spent the last day or so raging against Cruzs supposed caucus cheating, rather than pivoting to attack Rubio and the moderates in New Hampshire. And you could imagine him continuing along these lines all the way to a dramatic exit, rendering Cruz radioactive with the Trump bloc along the way.But with a figure as mercurial as Trump, theres no reason to assume that any pattern of attacks will hold for very long. If Rubio rises, and Trump stays in, its only a matter of time before they clash.Whereas Cruz has already survived one collision with Trump. And Cruz has already won a state. No other candidate can make either boast. And so long as that remains the case, no other candidate can claim to be a more likely nominee."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.   In the crowded New Hampshire primary, no candidate may shape the direction of the Republican presidential campaign more than the man who finished sixth in Iowa: Jeb Bush.With Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida each finishing more than 20 percentage points higher than Mr. Bush in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the former Florida governor is facing growing pressure to either demonstrate his appeal to voters or leave the race.Specifically, many Republicans  including some of his supporters and donors  said that Mr. Bush must finish ahead of Mr. Rubio in the primary here next Tuesday to justify continuing his campaign into South Carolina.If Rubio beats him badly in New Hampshire, Jeb is toast, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a Bush backer who spent most of Tuesday traveling the state with him. Mr. Graham added that Mr. Bush must either tie Rubio or beat him in this state.The burden falls so heavily on Mr. Bush, who won just 2.8 percent of the vote in Iowa, because of Republican anxieties about the top two finishers there, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump: Many party leaders fear that the nomination of Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz would lead to an electoral rout this fall.Were Mr. Bush to keep campaigning into South Carolina, he could create a split among pragmatic-minded voters, denying Mr. Rubio the chance to consolidate this bloc of Republicans  and strengthening the hands of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Many Republicans believe that if Mr. Rubio, who won an unexpected 23 percent in Iowa, right behind Mr. Trumps 24 percent, again delivers a strong performance in New Hampshire, he will have earned the right to carry the banner for the party establishment.Asked Tuesday evening by reporters how well he felt he needed to do in New Hampshire to justify staying in the race, Mr. Bush struck a defiant note.Oh, Im continuing on, he said. Im continuing on, yeah.Two rivals, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, are appealing to the same voters and also need a strong showing in New Hampshire. But Mr. Bush is far better financed and organized and can most likely stay in the race longer than they can otherwise.While Mr. Bush had $7.6 million in the bank and the super PAC supporting him had an additional $58.6 million as of Jan. 1, Mr. Kasich had just $2.5 million and Mr. Christie a paltry $1.1 million. And neither Mr. Christie nor Mr. Kasich, both of whom have spent the vast majority of their time in New Hampshire, has much in the way of organization in South Carolina.Mr. Bush, by contrast, has an active network of supporters there and has tapped into Mr. Grahams organization. And perhaps most important, the super PAC supporting Mr. Bush has shown a willingness, to put it mildly, to spend millions of dollars against his rivals, particularly Mr. Rubio, whom it has spent more than $20 million attacking.The prospect of the super PAC maintaining its assault on Mr. Rubio after the New Hampshire primary leaves many Republicans uneasy about Mr. Bushs intentions. And Mr. Rubios supporters, cognizant of these concerns, began moving on Tuesday to stoke these fears.If Jeb doesnt do well there, and hes still got millions and millions to spend, does he stay around? mused Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, a Rubio backer. Who knows.But, Mr. Gardner noted, more money has been spent attacking Republicans by fellow Republicans in this election than any cycle in the history of the party.It is not just supporters of Mr. Rubio who are dismayed. Some of Mr. Bushs major donors, including those with long ties to the family, are also growing impatient, hoping he will not go past New Hampshire absent a strong finish here.Few are willing to say so publicly, and on a Tuesday conference call the campaign held for fund-raisers, they did not even get a chance to say so privately: The Bush aides running the call did not open it up to questions.It is unclear what threshold Mr. Bush might feel he must reach to continue after the New Hampshire vote. But on the conference call and in talking points the campaign emailed late Monday night to supporters, Mr. Bushs team pointed to surveys showing him in a statistical tie for second in New Hampshire.The campaign also built up Mr. Bushs effort to win the state, and trumpeted New Hampshires recent role in determining the Republican standard-bearer. (Left unmentioned was the 2000 primary here, in which Mr. Bushs older brother, George W., lost in a landslide and still went on to claim the nomination.)The Granite State has long been the state voters look to in choosing the nominee and next president, the staff wrote in the email to supporters, highlighting Mr. Bushs endorsements and organizational strength.In reality, Mr. Bushs top advisers know Mr. Rubios finish in Iowa makes it harder for Mr. Bush to claim that he is the logical alternative to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. Yet he seems torn between focusing his fire on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Trump.On Tuesday, his campaign began airing an unusually long two-minute ad in New Hampshire attacking Mr. Trump for insulting veterans, women and the disabled. And at a stop in Henniker, N.H., Mr. Bush aimed some of his most pointed language yet at Mr. Trump, who finished second in Iowa, calling him a loser with deep insecurities.Yet on the same day Mr. Bush went so aggressively after Mr. Trump, he also sought to raise doubts about Mr. Rubio, incorporating Mr. Cruz for purposes of comparison.If you look at their records, theyre gifted in how they speak, but what about their life experience? Mr. Bush said at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, likening the two to President Obama, who was elected president after less than four years in the Senate. Is there something in their past that would suggest they have the capability of making a tough decision?Yet there are signs Mr. Bush may still have some work to do.Speaking at the Hanover Inn near the Vermont border on Tuesday, Mr. Bush finished a fiery riff about protecting the country  I wont be out here blow-harding, talking a big game without backing it up, he said  and was met with total silence.Please clap, he said, sounding defeated.The crowd laughed  and then, finally, clapped."}
{"text": "Inside the Citi Field news conference room on Wednesday afternoon, an impressive buffet featured three types of gourmet sandwiches. Several top Mets executives and Yoenis Cespedess business representatives sat in reserved seats. When Cespedes finally entered, he wore an expensive-looking suit, an oversize watch and a Louis Vuitton belt.Life can be good at the top.The Mets do not typically produce such fancy news conferences, but in recent years they have not been the defending National League champions, either. Nor have they been in the business of signing premier free agents to lucrative contracts  until last month, that is, when they surprisingly held on to Cespedes with a three-year, $75 million deal with a one-year opt-out clause.So the symbolism of Wednesdays event was hard to miss  from the food to the glitter to General Manager Sandy Aldersons joking about the Mets payroll, which should register at about $140 million at the start of the season, a heady number after years in which it was considerably lower.For the Mets, and their fans, the best part of the event came when Cespedes, addressing reporters through an interpreter, said he was really excited to be here for the next three years.That statement quickly got everyones attention. After all, the new contract allows him to opt out of the deal after the 2016 season and go back on the free-agent market, where he might get the kind of huge offer that did not quite come his way this winter. And the assumption has been that such an offer would not come from the Mets.Still, Cespedes indicated that he had no intention of being anything but a Met, not just this coming season, but in 2017 and 2018 as well.I have it in my mind to stay three years, Cespedes repeated, making clear just how much he likes playing for a team he did not join until July 31, shortly before the trading deadline.In deciding to stay with the Mets last month, Cespedes turned down a five-year deal worth roughly $100 million (but with plenty of deferred money) from the Washington Nationals, the Mets N.L. East rivals. In effect, he left $25 million on the table, although the Mets deal left him with the distinction of having the highest average annual salary of any position player who signed a free-agent deal this off-season. In any case, Cespedes maintained, It isnt always about the money.But for the last five years, since Alderson was hired as general manager, much of what the Mets have done has appeared to be about the money, which made the Cespedes signing such a big moment for Alderson and the Mets chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon. Asked if a $140 million payroll was the new floor for a team that not all that long ago had a payroll of under $100 million, Alderson smiled and said, You mean, is 140 the new 85?Turning more serious, Alderson added that in terms of order of magnitude, and assuming we continue to play well, we dont anticipate going back to those prior levels. He even said that if he found it necessary, he could add more salary to the payroll when this years trade deadline arrives.I think maybe if this Cespedes signing says anything, its that there are no possibilities that will be dismissed out of hand strictly for financial reasons, Alderson said.It helps the Mets that their core of immensely talented starting pitchers are under team control for the next few years, before they can test their values as free agents. The Mets control Matt Harvey for three more seasons, Jacob deGrom for five more and Noah Syndergaard for six.Alderson said the Mets would love to keep them all. But he added: Is it realistic? I think it could happen. Its a lot of money.Alderson indicated that the Mets could approach the starters representatives as early as this spring about signing long-term contracts that would extend into the first part of their free-agency years, but he noted that the players might not want to commit to that option.For instance, Scott Boras represents Harvey and usually seeks to get his clients to free agency as soon as possible. DeGrom and Syndergaard are represented by Creative Artists Agency, the same group that co-represents Cespedes. Brodie Van Wagenen, who is deGroms agent as well as Cespedess, was among those sitting in the front row Wednesday.I dont want to foreclose any possibility, Alderson said.He had another point to make: Sometimes, he said, everyone connected with the Mets, from the front office to the fans, dwells too much on the players they may lose to free agency rather than enjoying the moment.For the current Mets team, Alderson said, that moment should be relished. He said he hoped it would last two, three, four years. And perhaps Cespedes will be there to enjoy all of it, too."}

{"text": "Donald J. Trump is grieving.The billionaire businessman initially struck a magnanimous tone after he came in second to Senator Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.But for Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate whose campaign is all about winning, the loss was clearly a blow to his brand. And it hurt. Heres an examination of Mr. Trumps five stages of dealing with that defeat.Normally a force on television and social media, Mr. Trump went dark after his loss on Monday night. He avoided the cable news shows the next morning, and his Twitter feed was quiet for more than 15 hours  one of the longest stretches since he announced his campaign in June.When Mr. Trump finally broke his silence, he expressed exasperation at voters for failing to appreciate that he is self-funding his campaign (not exactly true  he has attracted millions in donations). He also could not understand how the news media had failed to grasp that he was always a long shot to win in Iowa, despite his lead in the polls there.Mr. Trump offered congratulations to Mr. Cruz right after the caucuses came to a close, but the graciousness would not last. In a Twitter rant, he assailed the Texas senator for being too long, rambling, overly flamboyant in his victory speech. Mr. Trump tried to tar Mr. Cruz as the 2016 version of Howard The Scream Dean.How come the person who comes in third on many of the networks is being covered like it is one of the great victories in the history of politics in this country? Mr. Trump said.There was much news coverage about the Trump campaigns organizational reach in Iowa over the last few months. Following his inability to win as many votes as Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump admitted that more focus should have been put on his ground game. But rather than taking personal responsibility, Mr. Trump said he would have invested more if he knew there was a problem.I think, in retrospect, we should have had a better ground game, Mr. Trump said on MSNBCs Morning Joe. I would have funded a better ground game, but people told me our ground game was fine.Almost 36 hours after losing in Iowa, Mr. Trump turned to what is usually the first stage of grief: denial. He accused the Cruz campaign of fraud because it had distributed voter violation fliers to compel people to caucus and because it had told voters, based on a misinterpreted news item, that Ben Carson was quitting the race. The only fair solution, Mr. Trump said, was to void the results and have a new election."}

{"text": "In the latest sign that automakers are still struggling to understand the scope of the Takata airbag crisis, Honda Motor said on Wednesday that it would expand its recall by more than a third in North America.The latest action, for 2.23 million vehicles in the United States, reveals just how much Honda, a longtime partner of Takata and the automaker most affected by the defective airbags, continues to be haunted by them. Now, Honda alone has recalled as many as 8.51 million Honda and Acura vehicles in the United States  a third of the recalls overall total.The newly recalled vehicles are part of a broader announcement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last month that five million more vehicles with the defective airbags would have to be recalled. At the time it did not have a breakdown of manufacturers.The airbags can rupture when they deploy, sending debris into the cars cabin. At least 10 deaths, including nine in the United States, and more than 100 injuries have been linked to the defect. Nine of the deaths were in vehicles made by Honda.When a car is recalled, it receives a new inflater, a metal casing containing the explosives that help inflate the airbag. The explosives, which contain a volatile compound called ammonium nitrate, can break down over time or when exposed to moisture, and may pose a danger.Honda and Takata have been aware of the defect since at least 2004, when an airbag ruptured in a 2002 Honda Accord.At the time, the manufacturers deemed the rupture an anomaly and did not alert safety regulators. It took Honda four more years to issue the first recall by an automaker over the defect, in 2008, and only for 4,000 vehicles.But since then, the problem has snowballed.Fourteen automakers have recalled about 28 million inflaters in 24 million vehicles. (In some cars, airbags on both the driver and passenger side have been recalled.)But the problem is potentially more widespread. Takata has sold as many as 54 million inflaters since 2000 that contain ammonium nitrate, according to an estimate by Valient Market Research and provided to The New York Times. That leaves tens of millions of cars with potentially problematic inflaters on the road that have not been fixed, or in some cases, have not even been recalled.The recent death of a South Carolina man highlighted the risks posed by cars that contain Takata airbags but have not been recalled. Joel Knight was killed after the airbag in his 2006 Ford Ranger exploded after an accident, sending metal fragments into his throat.His airbag had not been recalled. Ford has since recalled the 2006 Ranger.Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, confirmed on Wednesday that the agency had received a recall filing from Honda. The filing will be posted on the agencys website, safercar.gov, as early as Thursday morning, he said. Hondas expansion of its recall was first reported by Automotive News.The safety agency announced a significant expansion of the recalls last week, extending it to two manufacturers, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, that had not previously been affected.That came after N.H.T.S.A. in November imposed a $70 million penalty on Takata, a fine that could increase to $130 million if Takata does not meet terms of an agreement with the agency. It also noted that Takata had produced testing reports that contained selective or inaccurate data.The safety agency has given Takata up to three years to prove that the ammonium nitrate inflaters are safe, or face a possible recall of all inflaters in cars still on the road.Honda has said that no new Honda or Acura models under development would be equipped with front driver or passenger Takata airbag inflaters. Takata continues to supply Honda with other safety equipment, like seatbelts.According to Honda, the expanded recall affects driver-side aribags in the 2007-11 Honda CR-V crossover, 2011-15 CR-Z coupe, 2009-14 Fit subcompact, 2007-14 Ridgeline sport utility truck, 2010-14 Honda Insight hybrid and 2010-14 FCXClarity hydrogen fuel-cell models. The recall also affects several Acura luxury models: the 2005-12 Acura RL, 2007-16 RDX, 2009-14 TL, 2010-13 ZDX and 2013-16 ILX.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and the ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, denounced what he called the never-ending flow of piecemeal recall announcements for Takata airbags, which he said needs to end.He also called on federal regulators to stop relying on Takata for information. on what models and model years should be recalled. It is time for N.H.T.S.A. to get Takata out of this process, he said.He also called for speedier efforts to address a shortage of replacement inflaters, saying car owners shouldnt have to wait months to get their cars fixed."}
{"text": "Roger Federer had knee surgery Wednesday to repair a torn meniscus and will miss tournaments in Rotterdam and Dubai this month.It is a rare injury setback for Federer, 34, who had relatively minor back problems in 2008 and 2013.A statement on his official website did not specify which knee is injured, though it said the injury occurred last Friday, one day after his Australian Open semifinal loss to Novak Djokovic.While this is an unfortunate setback, I am encouraged and grateful that my doctor said the procedure was a success, Federer said on his Facebook page. I am looking forward to attacking the rehabilitation process this afternoon with my team and working hard to get back out on tour as soon as possible.His next scheduled tournament is in Indian Wells, Calif., starting March 7.The organizer of the Rotterdam tournament, the former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, said he got the news Tuesday.Obviously, receiving this information yesterday evening is a major setback for us, as it is for the fans looking forward to his presence, Krajicek said. We hope to have Roger back next year."}
{"text": "Fort Buchanan, a witty and eccentric debut feature from the filmmaker Benjamin Crotty, who was raised in the United States but is based in France, seems to have been born of an inspired mix-up, as if someone had hired the postcolonialist director Claire Denis (Beau Travail) to shoot an episode of M*A*S*H.Most of it takes place at a French fort whose precise location is never given. Roxy (Iliana Zabeth), an army brat, learns that she has been accepted to college, but frets that one of her two fathers  Frank (David Baiot), stationed in Djibouti  may have helped secure her an unearned admission. Her other father, Roger (Andy Gillet), is exasperated but sympathetic, chalking up his daughters sullenness to her unorthodox upbringing.With their romantic partners far away, the men and women of the compound seduce one another; sexual orientations arent an issue. When the gang from the fort visits Frank on his army base, he doesnt appear to be breaking a sweat. One of the funniest moments comes in a parody of a post-traumatic stress disorder flashback.Loose-limbed but not sloppy, Fort Buchanan  which has a grainy, restless texture, thanks to 16-millimeter film  at times evokes the vitality and experimentation of the French New Wave. And if, at barely more than an hour, the movie initially seems slight, its inconsequentiality might be better viewed as polemical: Fort Buchanan takes place in a geopolitical alternative universe, where bucolic military outposts are the sites of huge love-ins, and the greatest danger comes from gardening spray."}
{"text": "For the last few weeks, Vivienne Zhao, an investment banker who lives and works in Manhattan, has spent each Monday on a cleanse, consuming over the course of the day five liquid-based meals delivered in single-serve plastic containers.Among those typically included on the menu: pinto and black beans cooked with tomatoes and morsels of spinach and bok choy; garlicky carrots mixed with onions and alkaline water; and pured pumpkin spiked with cardamom and Saigon cinnamon.Like a growing number of people, Ms. Zhao came to the routine  known as souping, or going on a soup cleanse  after finding juice cleanses, which she tried several times, too extreme.The juice cleanses are difficult because you dont chew, and you dont feel like youre eating anything for days at a time, she said. Youre just really hungry.Ms. Zhao orders from Splendid Spoon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which offers vegan, gluten-free soups in single-day cleanses, with the option of adding five hearty soups as meal replacements over the course of a week. Around three-quarters of its clientele  predominantly women  choose the longer version, according to Nicole Chaszar, the company founder. Sales, she said, have tripled annually since the line was introduced in 2013.In January, Soupure, a company that opened in Los Angeles in 2014, expanded from local delivery to shipping its cleanses nationally. It also operates a popular outpost in Brentwood Town Center there. In Philadelphia, Real Food Works, a meal delivery service, added a soup cleanse to its menu in late 2013.The appeal of souping, in part, is that it promises an easier detox than a juice cleanse.When you do juice cleanses, your blood sugar can spike really high, said Despina Hyde, a registered dietitian at NYU Langone Medical Center. Soup cleanses are inherently lower in sugar over all because theyre using more vegetables and complex carbohydrates versus fruit. They also tend to be higher in fiber, which has so many good benefits.Elina Fuhrman, who founded Soupelina in Los Angeles in 2013, chimed in similarly: The juice cleansing trend started from a good place and evolved into something thats not so healthy, because theres a lot of sugar and not enough nutrients that the body needs.Soupelina offers soup cleanses of different durations as well as single-serving soups, and business has doubled in the last 12 months, Ms. Fuhrman said. The soups are prepared mostly with produce from two local farmers markets; the colorfully named offerings include Kale-lifornia Dreamin, Lentil Me Entertain You!, and And the Beet Goes On, a borschtlike crimson concoction.For the most part, the soups that make up these cleanses tend to be quite flavorful, thanks in part to a liberal use of spices like turmeric and cumin. They are often made with seasonally grown ingredients. Packaged without preservatives and delivered chilled, they lack the higher sodium content of, say, a can of chicken noodle from a supermarket. Some are drinkable cold, although eating them warmed up, ideally out of a bowl with a spoon, arguably underlines the sense that theyre a meal.Soupure includes hydrating, fruit-flavored alkaline waters as part of its cleanses, and a couple of drinks that are challenging to describe as soup, like a thick, sweet blend of strawberries and cashews that tastes somewhat like a dairy-free milkshake.I would say that some of our cold products are cold soup smoothies, said Angela Blatteis, a Soupure founder. We try to use the word soup for juice to just get across the point that its thicker, its more nourishing and its more nutrient dense.Soup cleanses also tend to be quite low in calories, often hovering around the 1,200 mark for a days worth of soup.Thats right at the borderline, said Ms. Hyde, the dietitian. A lot of people I work with need between 1,400 and 1,600 calories a day. Youre going to lose weight on low-calorie diets, of course, but it can lead to muscle breakdown. For that reason, she doesnt advise souping for more than one full day at a time.For those who prefer to make their soups from scratch, several books on soup cleansing have recently been published, including The Soup Cleanse by Ms. Blatteis and Vivienne Vella of Soupure, and Soupelinas Soup Cleanse by Ms. Fuhrman. The founder of Splendid Spoon plans one, too.Especially for busy people, soup cleanses offer, as juice-focused ones do, an undeniable benefit: convenience.My food pyramid was things you could get off a coffee cart, Jacqueline Harrison of Manhattan said. Now she frequently replaces a meal or snack with one of Splendid Spoons soups during 14-hour workdays as an owner of a landscape design and garden installation business. Bottled soups were really appealing because I could just grab them and go. It doesnt feel like youre on a diet  it feels like a meal."}
{"text": "There are no obvious signs of distress at the lavish San Francisco headquarters of the cloud storage company Dropbox, where on any given day, its hallways bustle with upbeat, well-compensated tech workers enjoying the customary trappings of start-up life. Dropbox is not laying off workers or shrinking; it hired nearly 500 people last year, 75 since the start of this year, and it plans to soon move into a sprawling, custom-designed office building for which it has signed a long-term lease.But that isnt the image of Dropbox youd encounter in the news media. Two years ago, the company raised a round of financing that valued it at $10 billion, making it one of the most highly prized start-ups of the tech boom. Now it faces a stock market that has turned unfriendly to initial public offerings of tech companies, not to mention stiff competition from publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Google and Box, the similarly named firm in a similar line of business.As a result, Dropboxs valuation has been battered by a series of markdowns from large investors who appear to have turned skeptical about its future. For instance, the mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price now considers Dropboxs shares to be worth half what they were at the time of the last fund-raising round.So whats really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying?Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valleys typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear.Its a fate that other Silicon Valley start-ups may be facing, especially with the dip in public and private markets for funding tech ventures. Dropboxs problems have less to do with the strength of its current business than with a delay, so far, in realizing the towering expectations that once surrounded the company. The start-up is like the college basketball star who manages to turn pro but is still regarded with doubt because everyone has now realized he might never be the next LeBron James. What happens to a company once thought to be worth $10 billion when it turns out to be worth only $5 billion, or $2 billion?According to Dropboxs executives, nothing too terrible  it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.Sentiment about companies goes in cycles, Drew Houston, Dropboxs co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. Google, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, Actually this is a pretty good company, and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy. The rest will take care of itself.At the moment, executives said, Dropbox isnt in any urgent danger. If it were running out of money, it might be forced to raise funds at a lower value than its previous one  a dreaded down round  but executives and board members said the company had plenty of money in the bank and was generating enough from operations to fund an expansion into new products and services.Other numbers are also promising, they said. More than 400 million people use the companys service  a place to keep documents online, so they can easily be shared and synchronized among different people and different computers  and the service is adding 10 million users a month. Dropbox also has 150,000 business customers, who pay annual fees of about $150 for each employee, and those ranks are growing by about 25,000 businesses a quarter.Insiders declined to specify Dropboxs revenue and growth rate, other than to say there had been increases since its last funding round, when the companys annual revenue was reported to be $400 million.Executives also said employee retention and hiring have not been hurt by the recent news. I asked several tech recruiters if they had noticed a diminished interest in working for Dropbox; none had. In the last year, Dropbox has hired from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.Dropbox is growing on the same trajectory as the best software-as-a-service companies ever  like LinkedIn or Salesforce, said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and a partner at the investment firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in the company. I dont know how we couldnt be thrilled with that kind of performance.But if Dropbox can still thrill its backers, it has also accumulated a chorus of skeptics. The company is one of several looking to ride two tidal waves now sweeping the business world  the trend toward business software that doesnt stink, known as the consumerization of information technology, and the rising willingness of companies to store their most precious data on online servers, or in the cloud.Dropboxs issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier. Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market  the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.Adding to this is the complication that Box, which has had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars building out a sales team to go after large companies, has been pummeled by investors for its persistent losses. The stock market now values Box at about $1.3 billion, about half of its value when it went public in January 2015.This sets up an unfavorable comparison for Dropbox: If Dropbox trails Box in the meatiest part of the market, and if Box is itself losing money, how can Dropbox possibly be worth 10 times as much as Box?Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesnt take into account the differences in the two companies business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropboxs chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient  and thus cheaper  than Boxs. When Dropbox visits a companys chief information officer on a sales call, it has something Box struggles to show  a large base of the companys employees who are already using its service.We fish in a pond thats used to our product, Mr. Woodside said. In the last quarter, Dropbox signed up 13 large companies with more than 1,000 users each, he said, three times as many as in the same period last year.Mr. Schreier of Sequoia Capital said Dropboxs potential for profit was more attractive than Boxs, and argued that when Dropbox eventually goes public, investors will recognize that difference.Aaron Levie, Boxs chief executive, disputed this assertion. Our differentiation and maturity in the enterprise market is what wins those customers, he said. A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. Were mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox, he said.Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox  not to mention Google or Microsoft  will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropboxs demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  On any given Sunday during football season, the N.F.L., a league that promotes itself as a standard-bearer of innovation, produces games that are analog at their core. The leather ball has been stitched the same way for decades, and the chain gangs hold the first-down markers like crossing guards at a busy street corner. The players smash into one another in a way a fan from a century ago would recognize.Yet the league, a $12-billion-a-year business, seems to be perpetually searching for the best and latest technology to help it deliver that analog product to its nearly 200 million fans, who are increasingly tech-savvy.The juxtaposition can be jarring.Enormous linemen push off one another in a shoving match that recalls something that could have taken place among heavyweights millenniums ago. And then those linemen head to the sideline and grab a tablet computer to scroll through high-definition photographs of their play.The collision of old and new is constant during the season, but it has been ever-present here in the cradle of the countrys high-tech industry in the lead-up to Super Bowl 50 on Sunday.In a region filled with private equity titans, dreamy entrepreneurs and futurists, the N.F.L. has been eager to show off its technological chops this week.On Tuesday, it hosted a round table called Future of Football (sponsored by Microsoft, a league partner). On Saturday, the league will hold a competition run by TechCrunch at Stanford University for 12 start-ups trying to win financing for products designed to improve the watching of the game at home and at the stadiums and to develop Tomorrows Athlete.The Super Bowl host committee has also raised millions of dollars in donations from a range of technology giants, including Apple and Google, two companies not normally associated with the N.F.L. or other sports leagues.Google is paying for its shuttle buses to ferry Bay Area fans to and from the game. Apple is also running company buses to the game, and it has donated iPhones and laptops to the Super Bowl host committee. Still, neither company has pulled out the stops to throw its brand around here in the same way as many other companies.Brian Rolapp, the leagues executive vice president for media, is paid to rub shoulders with the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and any other company that will deliver the N.F.L. to fans in a way that complements, but does not dilute, its principal product: the games.While the league may be eager to deliver football to its fans on whatever device they want to use, he said, it is reluctant to let that technology bleed too far into the game.A lot of that comes from the No. 1 objective, is to keep the competition pure, Rolapp said moments after attending a panel discussion that included a description of HoloLens, a headset being developed by Microsoft that will show games in augmented reality.All the stuff we talk about from a business perspective, if the game isnt fair, its not worth it, he said. The focus should be on the human competition. Were very protective of that.HoloLens is in its infancy, but Microsoft was eager to demonstrate to reporters how the device works. In a faux living room with a coffee table, a sofa and football-themed pillows, company technicians showed highlights from a Seahawks-49ers game on a flat-panel television.With the HoloLens headset on, you could see additional statistics to the left and right of the screen. The entire field was in view, not just the portion of the field shown on television. And on the coffee table, a hologram of a play appeared that could be started, stopped and rotated to better analyze the players on the field.Microsoft was careful to distinguish between virtual reality, in which viewers are immersed in a digital world, and HoloLens, which they called a mixed reality, with holograms, other images and data dropped into the field of vision. This, they said, is more complementary to the game.To an older generation of fans who grew up with a few games a week on network television and perhaps a highlight show or two in between, HoloLens may seem to be a high-tech distraction from the game.But the N.F.L. is more focused on younger fans. And if those fans are watching football in new ways and on new devices, then the N.F.L. would be foolhardy not to find ways to reach them.Phil de Picciotto, the president of Octagon Worldwide, a sports marketing agency, said: Football, as the leading sports platform, is a reflection of society, and society is more technologically dependent, so its logical that the N.F.L. will embrace technology.Innovative technology, de Picciotto added, has been a part of the N.F.L. for decades, such as the radio headsets in the helmets of quarterbacks and the Telestrator, the device that television analysts use to diagram plays on top of video. Most of these additions did not change the game but aimed to enhance it.What technology is unlikely to do, though, is fundamentally alter the game  the collisions, the Hail Mary passes, the fist pumps and the high-fives. At least for now."}
{"text": "Technology has upended where we work. The line between work and play has been blurred, and the difference between the office and home has all but disappeared.As a result, theres a new class of white-collar workers (or no collar, to be precise) who roam the earth looking for places to get their jobs done.Some of them work from home, curled up on the couch or in a home office  maybe with a drone hovering nearby. Others camp out at expensive cafes, refilling their mugs of fancy coffee throughout the day. (Yes, Im referring to myself.)But increasingly, these untethered employees are gathering in a new kind of office known as the co-working space.Surely, youve heard of these places. But their numbers have multiplied across the country in the last few years, filling a niche for those who need more than a cafe, but less than an office.They now come in a wide range of options. Some are fancy; some are not. Some require memberships; some do not. Some target technology workers; others are for writers or small businesses. And in the Los Angeles area, there seems to be a co-working option for every neighborhood and every profession.West Hollywood has WeWork, the start-up that is now in almost two dozen cities worldwide (its also estimated to be worth $10 billion, though many believe its drastically overvalued). Memberships are $45 to $450 a month, and the diverse clientele includes accountants and tech entrepreneurs.Beverly Hills has the Soho House, a private club that courts the Hollywood crowd (and can sometimes be a bit of a scene). Membership has to be approved by a committee and costs $1,800 a year.Santa Monica has Coloft, at $35 to $395 a month, and is popular with tech workers. It offers search engine optimization and programming classes, and tries to sound hip by turning its name into a verb (for example, We were colofting last night).These have been joined by even newer and hipper co-working spaces, including RVCC, which stands for the Reserve Vault City Club. This club occupies the old Federal Reserve Bank in downtown Los Angeles, costs $88 a month, offers free coffee and feels more like a speakeasy than an office space. (Sticking with that secret feel, RVCC proudly doesnt have a social media presence or a website.)And the newest is NeueHouse, a beautifully designed co-working space in Hollywood, in the 1938 CBS Radio Building on Sunset Boulevard. Opened last October, NeueHouse, which has branches in New York and London, puts a huge emphasis on cultural events, including Q. and A. sessions with musicians, writers and entrepreneurs. Memberships are $200 and $1,250 per month, depending on space.Before you rush out to join a co-working space, there are pros and cons to consider.Some believe working away from a traditional office improves productivity. A study published last year in the journal The Quarterly Journal of Economics examined Ctrip, a 16,000-employee Chinese travel agency, where call-center employees were randomly assigned to work in either the office or home. Those who worked from home were 13 percent more productive, the report found. When Ctrip gave all its workers the option to work from home, productivity grew even further, to 22 percent.Another study published last year in the journal Sleep Health, found that people who had flexible work schedules slept better than those who had to report to the office at specific times.But there are studies that raise doubts about working remotely. How Effective Is Telecommuting?, published last year in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest, found that working from home can make people feel sad. The report says that this is likely because of the social and professional isolation experienced from being home alone for too long.This is where co-working spaces seem to fit in.NeueHouse, for example, has two restaurants, a coffee shop and meeting rooms. There are also rows of desks equipped with headphones for those who want to work alone, and open offices for those who want to work in a collaborative setting.When I spent some time at NeueHouse last week, I saw waiters rushing to and fro with coffees and pastries, dropping them off at members desks or offices. It looked like a hotel with room service, but no beds. The space seemed open and simple, as in, there wasnt a lot of fuss (unlike some other spaces Ive tried out). Though I could see the $7 parking fee at NeueHouse easily adding up.Given the changes in the economy, and the changes in the attitude around work, we felt like it was the ideal time to pull out a blank piece of paper and rethink what the ideal work space would be for people, said Joshua Abram, a founder and chief executive of NeueHouse. Mr. Abram added that he sees NeueHouse as not only a place for people to work, but also a place to network and interact with other creative minds.If NeueHouse is about connecting people, then RVCC is the opposite. The founder, Chris Adams, said that we now live in a world of over-connections, and he wanted to create a sanctuary-like space that allowed people to work in solitude.These days, our culture is changing so much, Mr. Adams said. There are no regular work hours anymore, or socializing hours, so we wanted to set a platform for whatever you want to do. So if youre working late at night, and no cafes are open, you can come here and get a cup of coffee or an old-fashioned, and just work.After trying out of dozens of spaces in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, I realized I want to join them all. Which, like wanting to date more than one person, can become very expensive."}

Her son, Krystof, is opening a follow-up restaurant to his Brooklyn hot spot Maison Premiere, and he asked her for help. I just lent my son $100,000, she said, and it came back.The Vilcek Foundation, founded in 2000 by the Czech immigrants Jan and Marica Vilcek, awards biomedical scientists and artists from specific disciplines each year. Theater was chosen for its 2016 arts award, designed to recognize lifetime achievement.Ms. Zizka moved to the United States in 1977, and four years later founded the Wilma Theater with her husband, Jiri, who died in 2013. (Before the Zizkas arrived, the Wilma had existed in a smaller form as the Wilma Project.) In the past three decades, she has collaborated with artists like the Czech playwright and former president Vaclav Havel, as well as Tom Stoppard and Paula Vogel. She remains the Wilmas artistic director, and recently directed Mr. Stoppards The Hard Problem, which runs through Saturday.Throughout the Wilmas history, Ms. Zizka said, she has fought against the trend of regional theaters falling into corporate structures in which the life of the institution is more important than creating the art. For her, she said, the work is the center of everything.Separately, the Vilcek Foundation chose three winners of its $50,000 Prize for Creative Promise in Theater, awarded to immigrant artists younger than 38. They are: Sarah Benson, the British artistic director of Soho Rep.; Desdemona Chiang, a Taiwanese stage director who co-founded the company Azeotrope in Seattle; and Yi Zhao, a Chinese lighting designer who has worked with Ms. Zizka at the Wilma Theater. He is just one of the most imaginative visual artists, she said of Mr. Zhao. Very patient and quick at the same time."}
{"text": "It is easy to forget how beloved a celebrity O. J. Simpson was in his time  Heisman Trophy winner, N.F.L. superstar, Hollywood actor and pitchman supreme. Until he was arrested in the brutal slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman, after a televised police chase that transfixed the nation, he seemed to have transcended his roots in San Francisco housing projects.Yet if Mr. Simpsons guilt seemed clear to much of America, African-Americans were disinclined to see it that way. Over months of lurid televised court testimony  now being dramatized in a series that started this week on FX  Mr. Simpson became a symbol, to many blacks, of endemic racism in the justice system. And when a jury with nine black members declared him not guilty on Oct. 3, 1995, black people across the country cheered.I wasnt one of them.I must admit I was as disappointed as many whites that black college students gleefully applauded the verdict as if Mr. Simpson were one of the Scottsboro Boys. While the police and prosecutors had been far from brilliant, and reasonable doubt was, well, reasonable, Mr. Simpsons innocence seemed decidedly unlikely.At the time, what I saw was people ignoring the facts in favor of a kind of tribalism. A black journalism professor asked me, as a linguist, to lecture on language and the trial. Id be glad to, I told him, but I thought Mr. Simpson was guilty. I never heard from him again.Meanwhile, black friends and family continued coming up with ways that damning evidence could have been planted and obsessing over the use of a racial epithet by a police detective in the case. I felt alienated, angry, disappointed.But I was missing something. The case was about much more than bloody gloves and bloody footprints. It was about the centrality of police brutality to black Americans very sense of self.I came to realize this when, disgusted with the verdict and the response to it, I began to investigate  at first informally  why so many of my fellow blacks takes on racism seemed to me to be more fitting to 1935 than 1995.After a while I realized that the rub was that my life had spared me from experiencing or even seeing police abuse. I had seen the video images of the vicious beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles officers four years earlier but had lived too fortunate a life to spontaneously see it as something that could happen to me.To this day I am bemused by the occasional white person who assumes that I have a story to tell about triumphing over racism, that I was raised by working-class parents just getting by. I grew up solidly middle class in quiet, leafy suburbs  one integrated, one all black  where the police were the last thing on anyones mind. Racism had brushed my life now and then, but not at the hands of the police. This was what kept me from processing the O. J. Simpson business blackly, as it were.What I found when I spoke with people after the Simpson verdict, though, and have found since with numbing regularity, is that what prevents real racial conciliation and understanding in America is the poisonous relations between blacks and the police.I asked a black office worker what made him so sure Mr. Simpson had been framed, and he recounted just that kind of malfeasance by Oakland cops when he was growing up. And I learned not to assume that only men had such feelings. I asked a middle-class young black woman why she, too, felt that racism was the core of our experience. She instantly told me a story about her brother being senselessly harassed by cops for driving in the wrong place.The conversations were what ultimately prompted my interest in writing about race. And while the positions I took in books and articles went against the leftist orthodoxy, when it came to cops, my feelings had become the same as those more politically correct than I, and that wont change.Racism is experienced in many ways, but as Ellis Cose has put it, Rage does not flow from dry numerical analyses of discrimination or from professional prospects projected on a statisticians screen. Talk to most black people about racism and you need only count the seconds before the cops come up.Amid the round-the-clock cable coverage of the Simpson case, America learned the difference between what the cops mean to black people versus what they mean to most others.Too few got the message at the time.But after the killings of Walter Scott, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray and other unarmed blacks by the police over the past two years, the conversation has changed. Many non-black Americans who were disgusted by the Simpson verdict have become more aware of the ubiquity of police brutality in black lives.I suspect that the black response to the verdict, if it happened today, would surprise far fewer whites than it did 20 years ago.The Simpson show has been over for a long time, so long that now we can watch it performed by actors as an actual show. Its ending wasnt pretty, but it was telling, and today I understand why."}
{"text": "Europes national privacy agencies demanded more details on Wednesday about whether the European Unions new data transfer agreement with the United States would adequately protect individuals personal information.The move by the privacy regulators, which represent individual countries within the 28-nation European Union, indicates an unwillingness to accept the word of officials in Brussels that they can adequately safeguard citizens personal data.The group asked the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to provide a fuller explanation of how safeguards would work and to explain how Europeans could seek legal redress in the United States if they believed their data was misused.The primary concern is how much access American intelligence agencies will have to European citizens personal information.Europes privacy regulators set a Feb. 29 deadline for receiving the new information. If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate  and potentially fine  companies. And because the data pact cannot take effect until all 28 European Union countries have signed off on it, the questions raised by the national data privacy officials could complicate that process.These uncertainties, legal experts say, may threaten the new data transfer deal  known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.We want to receive the documents to assess whether the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield can answer our concerns, said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, Frances privacy chief, who is chairwoman of a pan-European body of national data protection authorities. We have to review the consequences of this arrangement.The data transfer pact, intended to replace a 15-year-old agreement that Europes highest court struck down in October, covers the trans-Atlantic transmission of peoples individual data  including online search queries, financial information and employee records.Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.Ms. Falque-Pierrotins group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the regions privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.I am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans, Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europes negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, she conceded, the current situation isnt ideal.The main provisions of the Privacy Shield included written guarantees by the United States that its national security agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans data when it is transferred to the United States.The deal also calls for the creation of a data privacy ombudsman within the State Department as the first point of contact for Europeans seeking redress for privacy complaints. These provisions would be reviewed annually to ensure that they met European privacy standardsThe national data protection officials, who had a two-day meeting in Brussels before making their announcement on Wednesday, are far from united over how the regions data rules should work.Some of them, including Ms. Falque-Pierrotin in France and her counterparts in Germany and Spain, have sent letters to companies warning them that the current trans-Atlantic data transfer system is on shaky legal ground. But others  particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters  have said they favored the current data transfer approach.This divide, legal experts warn, could lead to some agencies pursuing investigations into companies activities, on the behalf of citizens who believe their data may have been misused. Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the worlds largest economies.Businesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges, said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.Wednesdays developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.Theres a big concern about this agreement, said Estelle Mass, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. Will it hold up in court?Complicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europes tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.This standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europes data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.These privacy agencies had set a Jan. 31 deadline for European and American negotiators to agree to a new data transfer pact. And while the negotiators failed to reach an agreement by that deadline, they continued work almost around the clock, resulting in the deal announced on Tuesday.Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.Half a trillion dollars of trade is at stake, she said. We still expect that cool heads will prevail."}
{"text": "DEFYING most polls and predictions, a Latino won the Republican Iowa caucuses, and another Latino came in third. Together, they won more than half the vote.With Senator Ted Cruz taking nearly 28 percent of the vote and Senator Marco Rubio getting 23 percent, each vastly surpassed the results for any other Latino candidate in any previous United States presidential contest.How is that not being celebrated as historic or at least worth a headline for a day or two?The answer is not that complicated: Neither Mr. Cruz nor Mr. Rubio meets conventional expectations of how Latino politicians are supposed to behave.Neither of these candidates claims to speak for the Hispanic population or derive a crucial portion of their support from Hispanics, and neither bases much of his political identity on being a Latino. To varying degrees they oppose legalization for unauthorized immigrants, a policy that is central to most organized Latino political interests and that is supported by a great majority of Latino elected officials and Latino voters.No less an arbiter than Jorge Ramos, the Univision anchor, seemed to condemn them without naming names in a column last month. There is no greater disloyalty than the children of immigrants forgetting their own roots. That is a betrayal, he wrote. It is criticism that echoes the rhetoric aimed at Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court and other successful members of minority groups who are perceived as failing to uphold their own groups interests.The day after the caucuses the headline in La Opinin, the nations largest Spanish-language newspaper, was Ted Cruz, first Latino to win the Iowa caucuses. Why arent we celebrating? The story argued that Mr. Cruz denies his Hispanic identity. It recounted in great detail how at the age of 13 he jettisoned his Spanish nickname, Felito, in favor of Ted, which derives from his middle name, Edward. The story concluded that Mr. Cruzs disregard for his own identity, along with his extreme positions on immigration, posed an insurmountable barrier between him and a majority of Latino voters.Iowa put both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio into the top tier of contenders, and so the identity issue is bound to get further complicated as they begin to compete with each other more directly. In their caucus night speeches Mr. Cruz pounded home his vows to crack down on unauthorized immigration, while Mr. Rubio emphasized his immigrant parents struggle to realize the American dream. The contrast was not lost on Latino journalists. La Opinins story on Mr. Rubio had him walking a tightrope on immigration, mollifying the Republican base with tough talk while using his own immigration story to appeal to moderates. Like many English-language analysts, Univisions evening news proclaimed Mr. Rubio the real winner in Iowa for coming from behind to almost catch Donald J. Trump, and it included interviews with voters who hailed his crossover appeal.Just one night of voting gave us a firm reminder that minority group identities are neither fixed nor categorical, but that instead they can shift and take multiple forms. We learned that when Barack Obamas first presidential campaign took off with a victory in Iowa. In 2008 the voters got to know a politician whose ancestry and upbringing were far from typical of the African-American population but who nonetheless served as that populations tribune in powerful ways. Mr. Obama walked his own tightrope by striving not to be defined by his race even as his political strategy depended on rallying black voters to his cause.Latino identities are even less fixed and categorical than those of African-Americans because they do not draw on a singular historical experience like slavery nor the insidious social marker of race.Instead, Latino political culture is relatively new and embraces highly varied constituencies. Political identities differ according to where people came from, when and how they got here and where they ended up. Just as 2008 provided many Americans their first opportunity to consider voting for an African-American candidate who had a serious chance of succeeding, the Iowa results this year ensure that many Americans will be looking closely at Latino politicians for the first time, and it is going to happen under peculiar circumstances.Having two candidates providing the lessons rather than just one ensures a muddle. They both come from a national origin group, Cubans, with a distinctive political identity shaped by Cold War exiles. Cubans in the United States have reliably voted Republican, though that is shifting, and they make up just around 4 percent of the Hispanic population. The early primaries will distort their identities as they compete for the votes of angry whites against a rival, Mr. Trump, who has made hostility toward immigrants his signature.Who knows what facets of their identities will emerge if Mr. Cruz or Mr. Rubio or both are still on the stump by the time states with big Latino populations, like Texas, Florida and California, pick delegates?If either is still in the race next fall, when Republicans will be obliged to compete with Democrats for Latino votes, well know whether Iowa, of all places, opened a new chapter in the history of minority group politics again."}

Jealous, who headed the N.A.A.C.P. from 2008 to 2013, is expected to appear in New Hampshire alongside Mr. Sanders to come out publicly supporting the senator, according to a person connected with the Sanders campaign.Mr. Jealous, a well-known and respected figure, was at age 35 the youngest person ever elected to lead the N.A.A.C.P. and focused much of his time on issues of voter registration and mobilization.Mr. Sanders has been trying to strengthen his support among black voters as the race for the Democratic presidential nomination moves into more diverse primary states such as Nevada and South Carolina. Hillary Clinton, though, has a significant lead on Mr. Sanders among black voters, who have known and supported her and former President Bill Clinton for years.Mr. Sanders has had some success cutting into Mrs. Clintons supporters. Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator, was a prominent Clinton supporter in her state until, she said, she got on the phone with Mr. Sanders last summer. The lawyer for the family of Walter L. Scott, who was fatally shot by a police officer in South Carolina, also withdrew his support from Mrs. Clinton and endorsed Mr. Sanders last week.Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders also picked up an endorsement from the Las Vegas-based International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 357 on Thursday, making inroads with labor in a state where unions are expected to play an outsize role in the Feb. 20 Democratic caucuses.Mr. Sanders significantly trails Mrs. Clinton in big national union endorsements. He has picked up a few endorsements while Mrs. Clinton has been endorsed by more than 20 labor groups. Endorsements by unions in Nevada could prove critical as the states working-class voters go to caucus.The electrical workers union is now working to register all of its 4,000 members to vote and is encouraging them to caucus for Mr. Sanders, said Al Davis, the unions business manager and financial secretary.Joan Kato, Mr. Sanderss Nevada state director, welcomed the endorsement, saying the campaign looked forward to collaborating with the union. Bernie Sanders has been a lifelong labor advocate, even before he was running for president, she said in a statement. He stands in solidarity with workers, and our fight for fair wages, fair labor standards, workers safety, the right to bargain and organize  values that are shared among all unions  in Nevada and across the nation."}
{"text": "Like many young girls, Leyla Hussein didnt learn that she was going to have to undergo female genital mutilation until the day she was cut. She was born in Somalia and raised in Saudi Arabia and Italy but moved back to her homeland, where cutting is common, at age seven. It was actually my next door neighbors daughter that told me when I realized there was a big party taking place in the house, Leyla says. She was telling me part of my vagina was going to be taken away. While shes explaining I could hear this screaming inside of the house, which was my sister being cut.Leyla is now a prominent anti-FGM campaigner in Britain, where a documentary film about her crusade, The Cruel Cut, led to a Parliamentary inquiry, and public outrage fueled a requirement that health professionals report FGM cases. Shes also a psychotherapist who founded the Dahlia Project, which counsels women who have been cut. FGM involves removing part or all of the genitals of babies or young girls. It is most common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab states, though immigrants and their daughters are often subject to the practice.Here is an excerpted Q&A with Leyla, edited for clarity.Q: Did your parents have you undergo FGM happily, willingly, begrudgingly?My dads family actually didnt practice FGM. But it was a big secret in the family.Q: A secret that they didnt cut?They would have been stigmatized. But my mother had the pressure from her mother, from her older sisters. She didnt feel strong enough to not do it.People give me a hard time about this: Oh, you dont know what its like to have FGM, because you havent had type III. [Leyla had type I, the least severe type.] Physically, yeah, I didnt have type III. But psychologically, its still the same, because for me, its not necessarily about the cutting. Its the fact that a childs being grabbed, pinned to a table. You touch their genitals. To me, youve committed many crimes before you even cut that child. There was this idea, if you havent had type III, you shouldnt be able to speak about it.Q: It seems counterproductive to be squabbling within the community.There is like a status. I always acknowledge, yes, I didnt have a problem urinating, with my menstrual cycle, but I blacked out every time I had to have my vagina examined, because my body was remembering the trauma I experienced as a child.One of the things I noticed in the UK, theyve been campaigning for the past 35 years. Theyve done great work, but I walked in thinking its not enough. Everybody was still playing the political correctness game.Q: What do you mean by that?People were constantly calling this a cultural practice or religion. Leyla walks in and says, Its child abuse. When someones body parts are being removed, as far as Im concerned, its abuse. Its violence, full stop.Q: Talk to me about so-called medicalization.Oh, god. Medicalization of FGM?Q: Yes.Well, I was actually cut by a doctor. I was one of those people that was part of that whole, people thinking, if we medicalize it, it might be better. But for me, again, it goes back to why do we have to medicalize something thats harmful to women and children?Q: What about a baby and a symbolic nick  when theyre an adult you cant even tell?Again, same answer. Why does anyone have to harm a child?Q: What do you think of using the term cutting instead of mutilation?I personally prefer FGM because I worked with FGM survivors for the past 13 years. Its mutilation. However, as a therapist, when Im assessing women in my clinic, everyone has to define it for herself. I had a woman come into my clinic one time and I said, How do you define what youve been through? and she goes, Its genital genocide! And I thought: genital genocide  thats exactly whats been happening to women and girls.Terminology, for survivors, they have to identify for themselves. But for health professionals, they have to say mutilation.What about people who say its just like circumcision?My response is, okay, let me remove your genitals. For me, it doesnt make sense. The actual WHO definition, you have to remove the whole penis to compare it.Q: Would you say thats progress to go from type III to type I?Personally, I dont think so. I know some people would say that.Q: FGM is illegal in the UK, and its also illegal to do vacation cutting. Now you have a system of reporting where her parents are going to get in trouble. How does that work out?Unfortunately, theres a big loophole. That child is expected to give evidence. So it has to be taken out of the childs hands. No child would do that. People have to be prosecuted if theyre harming children. In France they dont even have legislation but theyve had over 100 victims. They use the neglect and child abuse act.The UK has the highest rate of girls who have undergone FGM in Europe. The fact that their genitals have been cut is the evidence. If I didnt feed her or her finger was missing, social services would be at my house in five minutes.Q: How would you have felt if your mom had gone to jail?\nPersonally? I would have hated it. But at the same time, thats what the legal system is there for.What does your family think? How did your daughter take you announcing the state of her genitalia [that she hadnt been cut] to the world?My daughters 13 now. She refers to herself as a radical feminist. Her favorite march is reclaim the night. In the middle of the night shes shouting Lets end porn. She has had a hard time me publicly declaring her status. She was isolated a lot in school.Q: Among the Somalis or everyone?Both. The Somalis actually told her: Our mums told us not to hang out with you because of your mum. I remember sobbing and I said to her, Do you want me to give up this job? And she said, No! She always says shes proud of me.Realistically, what do you think can be achieved as far as FGM in your lifetime?My dream would be to eradicate FGM for good. However, Im also a realist. Ive always said that well never get rid of murderers and rapists and pedophiles, but there is a legal system that protects us. I dont think FGM will end anytime soon. But I think theres hope."}
{"text": "We Are King(King Creative)King is a tribute band, in a way, but not to one artists work. Its three women channeling a specific spirit and a method of romantic, introspective, positive and harmonically sophisticated R&B.That might not sound like a high priority, if your understanding of the value of current R&B is predicated on how well it subverts or reframes its roots  as singers from many strata of pop have been doing, from Kelela and Dev Hynes to Drake and his heirs. So it helps actually to hear We Are King, the bands first full record after a 2011 EP, and let its details work on you a bit. I mean all of it: This is a record that works in aggregate and assumes that you have time.Even in its gentleness, with mildly Afro-futuristic lyrics about journeys and persistence and love, We Are King is pretty stubborn. It isnt making a leaner, blurrier or more gratification-delaying R&B  it gratifies from beginning to end  nor is it annexing hip-hops beats or essences. Its not a provocation on the ramparts of contemporary aesthetics; its not a 2016 revision of R&B, particularly. Its a musicians album, going deeper into the strategies of a strain of R&B that might begin with Stevie Wonders Music of My Mind (1972) and continue through Patrice Rushens Straight From the Heart (1982), as well as any number of Prince ballads and Luther Vandross party songs.Given all that, Im not sure how the record manages to evade the feeling of fetishizing the past. (The members of King  the twin sisters Paris and Amber Strother, and Anita Bias  wrote and produced the album, with Paris playing all the instruments, except for guitar and horns. But self-producing artists can be fetishizers, too.) Part of it has to do with hard work: stirring chord changes, analog synthesizers, bits of jazz and gospel, luxurious slow tempos and hypnosis built through a refrain over bulbous synth tones, as they do in The Right One and Supernatural and The Story. But part of it must have to do with their intent. King seems trend-agnostic: making music that isnt demonstrably new, but doing it in a way that isnt demonstrably old."}
{"text": "Since November, the Gjonbalaj family of Brooklyn has had at least a dozen reunions. Nearly all of them have taken place in New York City basketball gyms.Two Gjonbalaj brothers  Egzon and Pajtim  play for the Brooklyn College basketball team. A third, Edon, played for the Bulldogs until he graduated this winter.But the Gjonbalaj (pronounced JON-ba-lie) presence extends well into the stands. The brothers father, Bajram, is among the teams most engaged fans, slapping hands with players and berating referees, sometimes in his native Albanian. A fourth son, Idriz, an officer for the New York Police Department, attends most games as well, as does the youngest member of the family, a 15-year-old sister named Idriana.In fact, up to 40 Gjonbalaj relatives and friends attend most Brooklyn College home games, and many travel to road games as well. Among them is a cousin, Valon Djombalic, who played the previous two seasons for the Bulldogs.We bring the energy, Idriz Gjonbalaj said after the Bulldogs pulled into first place in the C.U.N.Y. Athletic Conference with a 100-99 overtime win over Lehman College on Jan. 27. Were just so happy.Its Egzon, though, who has brought unrelated fans to Bulldogs games. A 6-foot-5 senior who plays guard and forward, he leads the team in scoring, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and hopes to play professionally overseas after he graduates this year.Hes the best; he does everything, crowed his father, who like any father said he would like to see his son play in the N.B.A. one day.That is a long shot for any Division III player, but there is no denying Egzon has talent. He is among the conference leaders in most categories and is likely to finish second on the Brooklyn College career scoring list  a position currently occupied by his coach, Rich Micallef.At the Lehman game, Egzon showed an impressive range of skills, cutting easily through defenders for layups and dunks, stealing the ball, hitting 3-pointers. His free throw with seconds left in overtime provided the winning margin, leaving him with 30 points, 13 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals.Every contribution was met by fist-pumping cheers from the boisterous Gjonbalaj contingent, while fouls called against the brothers elicited loud groans and shouts at the officials. Idriana and her friends kept up a steady stream of chants. After a particularly good defensive play by the senior guard Nicholas Grasso, Bajram leaned forward from his seat in the front row to slap Grassos hand.Pajtim, a soccer player who decided as a graduate student to use his final season of eligibility to play basketball alongside his brothers, came off the bench against Lehman and played six minutes, scoring once  on a second-half 3-pointer off an assist from his brother. As might be expected, the basket brought a roar of approval from the stands.Since the Lehman game, Brooklyn has lost to the College of Staten Island by a single point and to York College in two overtimes, dipping into third place in the conference.The four brothers (Idriz, the policeman, also played basketball in high school) grew up playing together at twice-annual Albanian picnics. Those games were rarely competitive  We annihilated them, Edon said  but they paid off when the brothers joined forces at Brooklyn College.We didnt need to build chemistry, Edon said. Weve been playing together our whole lives. If I drive to the basket, I know theyre coming with me.The brothers are all Brooklyn, as their strong accents suggest, but their Albanian roots remain strong. Bajram moved to Brooklyn from Kosovo 28 years ago, but his family has retained close ties to New York Citys sizable Albanian population.Robert Holma, a regular at C.U.N.Y. Athletic Conference games, recalled Albanian flags at last years conference championship game, which Brooklyn College lost to Baruch in double overtime.All the players are local, so theyre going to have their rooting sections, Holma said at the Brooklyn-Lehman game, cradling a notebook of handwritten statistics and notes. But this may be the biggest one.The cheering section comes with benefits and challenges. As Pajtim sat on the bench in the second half against Lehman, for example, chants built in the stands for the coach to put him in.But after he entered the game and passed up an open 3-pointer, Edon shouted above the crowd, Shoot the ball! Pajtim rushed his next shot a few seconds later, but missed badly. You scared him, another fan called out.Pajtim shrugged off the incident after the game. They make you better, he said.And Micallef said the extended family, while understandably focused on all things Gjonbalaj, also helps the rest of his team, which at 16-5 is contending for an N.C.A.A. Division III tournament berth this season.They follow us around, he said. Its like having a home-court advantage everywhere."}
{"text": "DURHAM, N.H.  Gov. John Kasich desperately needs a strong showing here, and he has done his darnedest to make it happen, crisscrossing the state to hold 96 town-hall meetings, by his count.He has repeatedly pledged that if he gets trounced, he is going back to his home state of Ohio.And yet, for a candidate whose campaign is tied to the deliberations of voters here, he is uncannily, almost incongruously, relaxed.Its in the hands of the people of New Hampshire. Im not going to get manic, Im not panicked, Im not throwing a Hail Mary, if it doesnt work, it doesnt work, said Mr. Kasich, in front of a crowd of at least 100 gathered at an inn on Wednesday.Mr. Kasich, who calls himself the happy warrior, comports himself at campaign events with a mellowness that he hopes will allow him to rise above the fray of a bitter campaign. He has consistently avoided directly attacking his competitors, even as he notes that some of them are attacking him, and his supporters frequently refer to him as the only adult in the race.But those same appeals can sometimes seem so calm as to lack urgency, and he has sometimes purposely avoided opportunities to specify exactly what, or whom, it is from which he is differentiating himself since he rarely mentions his opponents by name.It remains to be seen how that strategy will play out in a crowded field with the clock ticking down.Could he be more explicit about that? said Fergus Cullen, a former state Republican Party chairman who recently announced his support for Mr. Kasich.Mr. Cullen then tried out a possible campaign line for Mr. Kasich: Look, folks, I know there are people in this room who are thinking about Chris Christie, thinking about Marco Rubio, thinking about Jeb Bush, and heres why I think you ought to support me over them. He could do that, but hes chosen not to. At this point, I think he has to stay the course.So on a day when Donald J. Trump said Senator Ted Cruz stole his win in the Iowa caucuses (Mr. Kasich, who campaigned little in Iowa, won 2 percent of the vote), and as Gov. Chris Christie found a litany of ways to call Senator Marco Rubio inexperienced, Mr. Kasich sidestepped opportunities to go negative.Im not interested in attacking other candidates, O.K., Mr. Kasich said, recounting what he had told to reporters at a breakfast that morning.Instead, here and at three other stops over the course of the day, he pivoted from topic to topic with no teleprompter or apparent narrative arc, speaking at length of balancing budgets, building consensus to achieve political goals, and the opiate crisis  New Hampshire has been hit hard by heroin addiction.Occasionally, he took sideways swipes at his opponents without naming them.How many people think were going to abolish the I.R.S. And have a 10 percent flat tax? Raise your hand, said Mr. Kasich, in a reference to proposals from Senator Ted Cruz.No one did. They keep saying it, and no one here believes it. I dont get the whole thing, Mr. Kasich said.And later, on foreign policy. Beware of bombast. You dont run foreign policy by yelling and screaming and threatening to do things 10 months before youre even in office, Mr. Kasich said.It is a demeanor that many voters have found refreshing.The whole positive message came through pretty strongly, said Jim Gracyzk, a retired electrical engineer who attended an event for Mr. Kasich in a smoky-smelling V.F.W. Hall in Raymond, N.H., on Tuesday. Kasich provides some nuance to things.But Mr. Gracyzk, like other voters who saw Mr. Kasich on Tuesday, is also considering another candidate: Marco Rubio.I like Rubios energy, he said."}
{"text": "Southbound is something you dont see much anymore: an anthology horror film. Its five segments do what theyre supposed to do  unsettle you  but as a bonus, they also leave you wanting more. These are fragments more than complete stories, and the incompleteness is its own kind of creepiness.An unnamed highway links the five, and The Way Out, the opening story (directed by the collective Radio Silence), sets the theme of escape, whether from the past or a physical threat. Two blood-covered roughnecks are trying to run from something not immediately revealed, but specters reminiscent of the dementors in the Harry Potter movies keep them pinned in place.Sirens (Roxanne Benjamin), the best of the segments, begins with a horror story classic: a vehicle that breaks down on a remote road. In this case, its the touring van of a girl band. The seemingly harmless couple who come to their rescue arent.That story blends into Accident (David Bruckner), in which a man tries desperately to save a young woman he has hit with his car. Then comes Jailbreak (Patrick Horvath), with a man locating his sister after a long search, only to find that she doesnt want to be rescued. The Way In (Radio Silence again), in which a family is attacked by masked men, ends the film on a particularly jarring note.The stories sometimes are vaguely linked, but the filmmakers (several had a hand in the 2012 horror anthology V/H/S but have upped their game here) arent after tidy tales, neatly connected and concluded. They know that the human mind finds loose ends unnerving."}
{"text": "In a major reimagining of the New York City waterfront, Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to propose a streetcar line that would snake along the East River in Brooklyn and Queens, a 16-mile scenic ride that would be his administrations most ambitious urban engineering project to date.The plan, to be unveiled on Thursday in the mayors State of the City speech, calls for a line that runs aboveground on rails embedded in public roadways and flows alongside automobile traffic  a sleeker and nimbler version of San Franciscos trolleys.By winding along the East River, the streetcars would vastly expand transportation access to a bustling stretch of the city that has undergone rapid development  from the industrial centers of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to the upper reaches of Astoria, Queens  but remains relatively isolated from the subway.For Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat focused on social reform, the plan also represents a shift to the kind of ambitious Robert Moses-style planning that New Yorkers more often associate with his predecessor, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who made transportation a hallmark of his tenure.The streetcar system, which would realize a long-held fantasy of the citys urban planners, is expected to cost about $2.5 billion, significantly less than a new underground subway line, city officials said on Wednesday.Its operation, however, remains far-off. Under the plan, construction would start in 2019, after studies and community review; service would begin several years after that, perhaps not until 2024, officials said.Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, acknowledged some significant engineering challenges when you are putting a modern system like this in a very old city.But Ms. Glen said the citys existing transit network no longer met the needs of a metropolis whose commuting patterns have shifted significantly in the last two decades. A streetcar route, she said in an interview, offered a novel and practical fix at a time when federal money for infrastructure is scarce.The old transportation system was a hub-and-spoke approach, where people went into Manhattan for work and came back out, Ms. Glen said. This is about mapping transit to the future of New York.Streetcars are a staple of European capitals, and have arrived in cities like Atlanta; Portland, Ore.; and Toronto. But they have failed, until now, to catch on in New York, where the Bloomberg administration rejected a proposed line in Red Hook, Brooklyn, as being too expensive.The de Blasio streetcars would travel about 12 miles per hour, with a trip between Greenpoint and Dumbo in Brooklyn lasting around 27 minutes, less than current routes on buses and subways. Barriers could physically separate the streetcars from automobiles along some portion of the route, although officials said those details would be determined later.The cars would directly link Brooklyn and Queens, two boroughs that can be difficult to travel between without a detour into Manhattan. And though an exact route has not been made final, the system would most likely serve growing commercial centers like the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Long Island City, Queens. About 45,000 public-housing residents live a short walk from the route, the administration said, a priority for Mr. de Blasio, who has focused on combating inequities.Administration officials believe the systems cost can be offset by tax revenue siphoned from an expected rise in property values along the route.Because the cars would operate on city streets, the project is not expected to be subject to state approval  meaning it would not require the blessing of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who last year was quick to quash a major State of the City proposal by Mr. de Blasio to build lower-cost housing over train yards in Sunnyside, Queens. (Mr. Cuomo said the yards, which are partly controlled by the state, were not available.)The neighborhood review process for the streetcar route could be onerous, given the vast distance it would travel. But Mr. de Blasio can expect support from major developers, including Jed Walentas of Two Trees Management, whose residential conversion of the Domino Sugar refinery on the Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn is set to open soon. Mr. Walentas, who has both clashed and collaborated with the mayor, has championed the streetcar plan, helping to pay for a study on its feasibility and cost.Mr. de Blasio, a self-proclaimed political ideologue, has acted more attentive of late to his mixed reputation as a manager, which could be a vulnerability as he looks ahead to a re-election campaign in 2017. His State of the City address is expected to include a plan for quicker trash pickup and a smartphone payment system for the citys parking meters.Transit has never been a passion for Mr. de Blasio, and while the mayor earned praise from transportation advocates for his Vision Zero safety plan, he was criticized after casually suggesting that the city tear out the open-air pedestrian plazas in Times Square.On Wednesday, his embrace of the streetcar idea yielded positive reviews, even as some transit experts complained about wanting more details.The more mass transit we have, the better off we are as a city that is growing, said Richard Ravitch, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.In his book, Mr. Ravitch said, the plan was brilliant. He added, Not everybodys going to ride bikes."}

It was a shift from the previous two years, during which a surge of biotech companies made their public-market debuts.There were 84 biotech companies that went public in the United States in 2014, the largest number on record, while last year 50 such companies conducted I.P.O.s, according to Dealogic.Editas makes a gene-editing technology that is aimed at treating diseases for which the genetic causes are well understood. The companys most advanced product would be used to treat a progressive form of blindness. Editas is also conducting research on preventing cancer, and it is teaming up with an immunotherapy company, Juno Therapeutics, to do so.BeiGene, with a team of more than 215 scientists and other staff members, is creating a pipeline of oral drugs and antibodies to treat cancer.Both companies plan to use proceeds from their initial offerings to fund clinical trials. They have several big-name biotech backers to help take them public during these rocky times. Hillhouse BGN Holdings and Baker Brothers said on the cover of BeiGenes prospectus that they would buy half of the I.P.O. on the terms accorded to the other investors. Third Rock Ventures, Deerfield Management and Fidelity acquired stakes in Editas before its I.P.O.Editas and BeiGene listed their shares on Nasdaq. Editas trades under the symbol EDIT, while BeiGenes ticker is BGNE. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase advised Editas on its offering, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley managed the BeiGene offering."}

Many of the contenders who are in the race today will have dropped out. Its conceivable that the race for the nominations will be over.The New York primaries are traditionally held after its too late for New Yorkers to cast a meaningful ballot. As a result, we are usually ignored by presidential candidates, and practically the only time they show up in New York before the convention is to ask for our money. Issues affecting New York are ignored by the contenders during the primaries.I urge the State Legislature to change the date of presidential primaries four years from now so New York voters will have a chance to cast their ballots when it counts  before most of the contenders drop out.PAUL FEINERGreenburgh, N.Y.The writer is Greenburgh town supervisor."}
{"text": "As Zoolander 2 begins on the streets of Rome with a chase scene straight out of the Mission: Impossible movies, Derek Zoolander  once a really, really ridiculously good-looking three-time male model of the year and still an incredibly poor speller  is nowhere to be found.But when the worlds top music stars fall victim to mysterious assassins, all wearing Dereks signature Blue Steel pout in their final social media posts, the dimwitted but lovable model emerges from his self-imposed hiding to help Interpol. And he finds himself back in a fashion world he scarcely recognizes.Nearly as different is the way that industry has responded to Zoolander in the 15 years since Derek (Ben Stiller) and his model nemesis, Hansel (Owen Wilson), made their debuts.The first time around, we were outside of the fashion world, said Mr. Stiller, the director and co-writer of both films. For the new movie, which opens Friday, Feb. 12, just in time for New York Fashion Week, designers and models clamored for parts in the film or in its inventive (and extensive) social-media marketing push.Derek and Hansels long absence from the screen may actually work to their advantage. The fashion industry has since harnessed social media to increasingly global ends. And the symbiotic relationship of pop culture and fashion has become even tighter.Its about vanity and ego, Mr. Stiller said of the original idea of the movie. And I think there is something thats happened since our phones have turned into cameras that connects with the idea of being obsessed with ourselves.Self-obsession is something fashion knows about. During production of the first Zoolander, most in that world didnt quite know what to make of Mr. Stillers intentions. Mr. Wilson recalled that several male models walked off the set, upset at the portrayal of their profession. Nearly all the cameos were a result of guerrilla filmmaking during commercial breaks and on the red carpet at the VH1 Fashion Awards. And look-alikes played the star chamber of designers orchestrating the dastardly plot of the evil mastermind Mugatu (Will Ferrell).In Zoolander 2, the cabal features the real thing: The designers Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, Valentino and Alexander Wang clambered aboard to send up themselves and trade insults with Mr. Ferrells character. Mr. Jacobs is such a fan of the original that during a recent St. Barts vacation, he filmed a homage to the orange mocha Frappuccino scene, in which Derek and his model roommates, favorite beverage in hand, go for a joy ride that ends in fiery tragedy.And Mr. Hilfiger was so game to participate, he willingly donned dark purple robes  they were like heavy velveteen drapery, he said  for his scene shot last summer at the sweltering Cinecitt studios in Rome.He led me down a path, you could say, Mr. Hilfiger said of Mr. Stiller. He would give me the line, then say give me more. Do more. Ad-lib.Mr. Stillers Baedeker to this strange, intimidating world was Anna Wintour, the all-powerful arbiter of style and maker of careers as editor in chief of Vogue. Being able to have Anna there to sort of validate what we were doing was the biggest thing and opened a lot of doors for us, Mr. Stiller said.A fan of the first movie, Ms. Wintour steered him to relevant designers and models and explained how social media had upended the business. Her introduction to the creative directors of Valentino, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli, resulted in Derek and Hansel walking in the designers show during Paris Fashion Week last March to announce that Zoolander 2 was on. It was a surprise, headline-grabbing stunt, much more effective than a news release.Ms. Wintour, who was in on the secret, of course, appears in the movie, playing herself and giving as good as she gets in a verbal smackdown with Mugatu.Justin Theroux, who played a diabolical D.J. in the original and is a co-writer of the new one, likens the Zoolander movies, which have a lighter satirical touch than say, Robert Altmans Ready to Wear, to his experience with a Hollywood parody he helped write, Tropic Thunder. Thats the beauty of this kind of satire, he said. People will say, I know exactly what kind of actor that is, or Ive worked with models just like that, but they dont think theyre actually the object of the ridicule. So its a wonderful game of finger-pointing where no one really gets hurt and everybody gets to enjoy it.And the designers and models understand that poking a little fun at themselves can be good business in a globally interconnected culture.The Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavor in 2013 bought IMG, which owns, operates or represents 13 fashion weeks, including those in New York and Milan, and represents models like Karlie Kloss and Miranda Kerr. The TV show Project Runway may not have discovered the next big designer, but it helped turbocharge Michael Korss visibility and fortunes. And not too long before Ms. Wintour put Mr. Stiller as Derek Zoolander on the cover of Februarys Vogue (alongside Penlope Cruz), Kanye West and Kim Kardashian received that honor.Who would have ever thought that would happen? said Mr. Hilfiger, whos used Beyonc, Kate Hudson and Usher in his companys advertising and created campaigns that lovingly aped The Royal Tenenbaums.Instagram is the perfect vehicle for an image-driven industry, and todays supermodels are the ones with the biggest social media presences, where a self-deprecating tidbit about their personal lives resonates much more than their latest magazine cover. The creators and marketers of Zoolander 2 are milking those connections with abandon.To accompany the Paris premiere at the end of January, Cara Delevingne treated her more than 26 million Instagram followers to the highs and lows of her three-hour relationship with Derek. On Jan. 31, as the junket moved on to Rome, Derek and Hansel, clad in Valentino duds, appeared suddenly in the windows of the flagship Valentino store, synchronizing their changing poses about every 10 seconds. Their lark was edited into a short music video and posted, of course, on Instagram.Mr. Stillers production company, Red Hour, has been busy creating content for the peripheral characters in the movie, like a faux infomercial featuring Kristen Wiigs surgically enhanced designer, Alexanya Atoz, hawking her Youth Milk concoction made from desert flower cactus and distilled water from natural street puddles in Indonesia. (Because, as she says, When you look old, you feel sad.) As of Feb. 2, the infomercial has been viewed 11.5 million times. And Red Hour has created the Blue Steel Selfie Studio, so fans can share their version of Dereks signature pursed-lip, drawn-in-cheek stare.Mr. Stiller seems a bit baffled by the enduring popularity of Zoolander and its clueless leading characters.When the first movie came out, it wasnt really a hit, he said with a self-deprecating laugh.Released just a few weeks after Sept. 11, the movie took in little more than $45 million at the domestic box office. Yet its mix of slapstick silliness and gentle satire has given it a successful afterlife on DVD and streaming services.I really dont think Ive ever been part of a movie that its fans had such a strong connection to it, Mr. Stiller said. They begged him for a sequel when he was promoting other movies. So it kind of spurred me to want to look into making it happen.Also prodding him was Brad Grey, who became chairman and chief executive of Paramount Pictures in 2005. For the studio chieftain, Mr. Stiller represented a movie business anomaly: an American whose comedies travel well. Even though Zoolander did little business overseas  just $15.6 million  Mr. Grey was encouraged by the international success of his other films like the Night at the Museum series.Still, it took another decade for Zoolander 2 to start filming. There were matters of scheduling and a budget to hammer out  which ultimately came in at slightly more than $50 million  and finding a concept that could carry a 90-minute movie. An early draft set the sequel in Miami circa 2005, then a thriving fashion scene. But when Mr. Ferrell  by then a leading man in his own right  wasnt quite ready to revisit Mugatu, the project was put on the back burner.Then, in 2009, Mr. Stiller, Mr. Theroux and John Hamburg hit upon what became the eventual scenario of Zoolander 2: Expanding Derek and Hansels world, they set most of the movie in Europe, and made Mugatus revenge attempt the catalyst. Story lines about the responsibilities of fatherhood were folded in amid the fashion-world excess and a cavalcade of pop-culture cameos (Justin Bieber, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kiefer Sutherland, Ariana Grande, Willie Nelson, even Jim Lehrer!).But the broad comedy of the original remains. AC/DC and the Ramones  theres not a lot of growth in their sound, Mr. Wilson said. Sometimes you just find the right sound, and you keep doing that.Mr. Stiller, just before leaving New York for premieres in Sydney, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, London and Rome, seemed wonder-struck at the attention the new movie is receiving. Its like Dereks having a resurgence, Mr. Stiller said. Hes been out of it for a few years, and now hes having an upswing. He finally got his Vogue cover. So Im happy for him. Because its a tough business."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO   With anxiety heightened three months after terrorists struck a stadium amid a bloody series of attacks in and around Paris, local and federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday that there was no credible threat to Super Bowl 50 and that several measures, many of them not visible to the public, would protect it.The secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, flanked by nearly a dozen other law enforcement officials, said security for the game, set for Sunday, and for events surrounding it here this week involved an array of local and federal law enforcement agencies. He said many measures would not be seen by the public, but he did not elaborate.We look forward to a safe and secure and successful Super Bowl, said Mr. Johnson, who inspected Levis Stadium, the site of the game, earlier Wednesday. He said he would not be at the game.Security is always a concern at the Super Bowl, one of the countrys highest-profile events. Last years game, with 168 million viewers, was the most-watched show in American history.But security this year has received greater focus by the league and security officials after the attacks in Paris in November, when terrorists struck several venues, including Stade de France in the northern suburb St.-Denis during a match between the French and German soccer teams.The attackers did not get past the gates of the stadium that night, but their attempt was a reminder that stadiums can be targets.Mr. Johnson said he had been in contact with his counterpart in France at the Ministry of the Interior. Jeffrey Miller, the head of security for the N.F.L., traveled to France over the summer, before the attacks, as part of a session to share knowledge among international security experts.Were always collectively talking and paying attention to trade craft and things occurring overseas because if we see something happen there, there is a good possibility someone may try to do something like that on U.S. soil, Mr. Miller said.The Super Bowl has a Tier 1 special event assessment rating, which allows federal agencies to spend money to help secure the event. That rating is one level below a national special security event, the highest. The first Super Bowl after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, held in New Orleans, had that designation.Mr. Miller said a no-fly zone would extend from San Jose, Calif., to near San Francisco International Airport, starting an hour before the game and continuing until midnight. Many fans flying to the game on private jets will arrive in Oakland, Calif., as a result. The temporary flight restriction does not apply to commercial flights controlled by air traffic control."}

{"text": "Sexually active women who are not using birth control should refrain from alcohol to avoid the risk of giving birth to babies with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, even if those women are not yet known to be pregnant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended.The C.D.C. report, released on Tuesday, estimated that 3.3 million women between the ages of 15 and 44 who drink alcohol risk exposing their infants to the disorders, which can stunt childrens growth and cause lifelong disabilities. The report, which appeared to refer exclusively to heterosexual sex, also said that three in four women who intend to get pregnant do not stop drinking alcohol when they stop using birth control.The risk is real. Why take the chance? Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the C.D.C., said in a statement.Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been widely linked to stunted physical, mental and behavioral development of children. In October, a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics declared that no amount of alcohol should be considered safe to drink during any trimester of pregnancy.About half of pregnancies are unplanned, and most women do not know they are pregnant until four to six weeks into the pregnancy, the C.D.C. noted. The only way to ensure that the effects of alcohol would not be passed on to a child, then, would be alcoholic abstinence.The suggestion of indefinite sobriety did not sit well with some women.The latest recommendation to avoid alcohol completely is obviously out of step with the way many pre-pregnant people live their lives, Ruth Graham wrote in Slate, calling it swath-yourself-in-bubble-wrap thinking.Why is it that whenever public health officials talk about alcohol, they act like theyre Puritan robots from outer space who could never understand earthlings love of distilled spirits, Olga Khazan asked in The Atlantic.And the reaction on social media sites ranged from mocking to incredulous.The American Beverage Institute, a restaurant trade association, also criticized the new recommendation. In a statement, Sarah Longwell, managing director of the institute, said: The C.D.C.s view on alcohol is incredibly puritanical. Alcohol can be safely and responsibly consumed by women, even if theyre theoretically capable of having children.While the excessive use of alcohol during pregnancy clearly has a harmful effect on unborn children, advising all fertile women to avoid any alcohol simply isnt a realistic solution to this public health problem.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however, applauded the recommendation.In many cases of unintended pregnancy, women inadvertently expose their fetuses to alcohol and its teratogenic effects prior to discovering that they are pregnant, Dr. Mark S. DeFrancesco, the organizations president, said in a statement. This is just another reason why its so important that health care providers counsel women about how to prevent unintended pregnancy through use of the contraceptive method that is right for them."}

{"text": "Hard-wired into the Supreme Courts DNA is the notion that the court doesnt reach out to decide a constitutional issue if it can resolve a case by interpreting a statute. The court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it, is how Justice Louis D. Brandeis expressed this principle of judicial restraint 80 years ago in a concurring opinion to which the court often makes reference.So the courts action two weeks ago in accepting the Obama administrations appeal in a major immigration case was startling. The surprise was not that the court agreed to hear the case, United States v. Texas, an appeal from a ruling that the president lacked authority under the immigration laws to defer deporting undocumented immigrants whose children are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. It was rather the blockbuster constitutional question that the justices added to the case, a question the court had not been asked, and one that neither of the lower federal courts had even addressed when they ruled on purely statutory grounds against the administration.This is what the court said in its Jan. 19 order: In addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether the Guidance violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, 3. Wow. The guidance is the memo that established the deferred-action program, issued in November 2014 by Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security. The Take Care Clause provides that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. It is a constitutional provision that the Supreme Court has hardly ever addressed directly. Justice Antonin Scalia invoked it years ago, in a 1992 decision holding that environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge the adequacy of the Reagan administrations enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.The statutes explicit citizen suit provision was not sufficient to authorize a lawsuit for a generalized grievance, Justice Scalia wrote in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife. It was obvious, he said, that to permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive officers compliance with the law into an individual right vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the president to the courts the chief executives most important constitutional duty, to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.The Lujan decision, one of Justice Scalias most important opinions in 30 years on the court, thus used the Take Care Clause to protect a presidents prerogatives. But times change. By transforming an important but still ordinary statutory interpretation case (Does the Immigration and Nationality Act give the president this degree of prosecutorial discretion? Should the guidance have been issued as a formal rule under the Administrative Procedure Act? On what basis do the 26 states that brought this lawsuit have standing?) into a major constitutional one, the court turns the Take Care Clause from shield to sword, with the conservative justices brandishing the sword.The protests I expected to hear from the administration and its allies have not materialized. The message from such progressive organizations as Americas Voice, an immigration advocacy group, seems to be that its just as well that the Supreme Court will address the Take Care Clause because the issue might otherwise re-emerge, after a narrow Supreme Court ruling, in the Brownsville, Tex., courtroom of the openly hostile federal district judge, Andrew S. Hanen, who imposed a nationwide injunction against the deferred-action program a year ago. (The states had raised the Take Care Clause in their initial District Court complaint, but Judge Hanen didnt address it, and neither did the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the injunction.)I understand the strategy. The administrations job is not to criticize the court but to make its best argument on the law and persuade five justices that its right. After all, if the court finds that Congress has given the president sufficient authority for the deferred-action program, there is no Take Care Clause issue to discuss.Call me a cynic, but I just dont see the Take Care Clause question as the benign or even neutral act of a court seeking efficiency in clearing up an unsettled issue. For one thing, theres nothing about this rarely invoked clause that needs settling. (In their response to the administrations Supreme Court petition, the states wait until page 37 of their 39-page brief even to mention the Take Care Clause.) For another, its impossible for me to divorce the courts action from the ever more strident anti-Obama rhetoric filling the right-wing airwaves and blogosphere.There has been a concerted effort to portray a lawless president, an emperor of the United States, in the words of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama. Federal courts need to stop Obama from flouting the Constitution, was the headline on a Washington Post op-ed co-written by David B. Rivkin Jr., a Washington lawyer who was a force behind the legal attack on the Affordable Care Act. George F. Will, a Washington Post columnist deeply in tune with the capitals conservative elite, wrote in a June 2014 column titled Stopping a Lawless President that while many presidents seek to enhance their power, President Obamas offenses against the separation of powers have been egregious in quantity and qualitatively different. Immigration was only one item on Mr. Wills list of the presidents offenses, which included implementation of the Affordable Care Act, welfare, education and drug policy. Republicans in the House of Representatives have frequently mentioned impeachment.Impeachment aside, Justice Scalia, ever more unconstrained and therefore ever more useful as a barometer of right-wing thought, made his own notable contribution to this chorus. In June 2012, the court decided a high-profile immigration case from Arizona, invalidating several provisions of the states recently enacted anti-immigrant statute on the ground that immigration policy was the province of the federal government. Justice Scalia dissented and, reading a statement from the bench, provided his own rationale for the Arizona law.Ten days earlier, President Obama had announced a program to defer deportation for young undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. Yet even though the presidents action had nothing to do with the case before the court, Justice Scalia nonetheless channeled the Republican criticism of the presidents action in his statement from the bench: The president has said that the new program is the right thing to do in light of Congresss failure to pass the administrations proposed revision of the immigration laws. Perhaps it is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of federal immigration law that the president declines to enforce boggles the mind.What had come to pass, he continued, was the specter that Arizona and the states that support it predicted: a federal government that does not want to enforce the immigration laws as written, and leaves the states borders unprotected against immigrants whom those laws exclude. So the issue is a stark one: Are the sovereign states at the mercy of the federal executives refusal to enforce the nations immigration laws? A good way of answering that question is to ask: Would the states conceivably have entered into the union if the Constitution itself contained the courts holding?He concluded with this red-meat line: If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign state.In the context of the 2012 election year, this was an amazing public statement by a sitting Supreme Court justice. Am I the only one to think that it explains a good deal about the order the court issued last month, or to wonder whether the court can be unaware of the politically charged discourse its order embraces?I noted earlier that the Supreme Court has hardly ever examined the Take Care Clause. There was, however, an early sign last term that the clause might be moving from the wings to center stage. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, a case decided last June, the court upheld the State Departments refusal to list Israel as the place of birth on passports issued to American citizens who were born in Jerusalem, despite an act of Congress directing the department to do so at the individuals request. With a majority opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court held that the statute was an unconstitutional infringement by Congress on the presidents exclusive power to recognize foreign governments, a power the court said was essential to the conduct of presidential duties. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. dissented in an opinion that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. also signed. The court takes the perilous step  for the first time in our history  of allowing the president to defy an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs, the chief justice wrote. The first principles in this area are firmly established. The Constitution allocates some foreign policy powers to the executive, grants some to the legislature, and enjoins the president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Theres a difference, of course, The law at issue in that case was clear, as was the State Departments defiance of it. In the immigration case, by contrast, the administration argues that the deferred-action program is an application of long-recognized discretion in immigration enforcement policy that dates back to regulations adopted during the Reagan administration. Of course, a court genuinely mindful of principles of judicial restraint would not even need to reach the statutory question, let alone the constitutional one. The states claim to injury, let alone the kind of injury that gives them standing to sue for nonenforcement of the immigration laws is even more tenuous than the long-ago claim of the environmentalists, thrown out of court by Justice Scalias Lujan decision. (I discussed the issue of the states standing in an earlier column.This is a case that should have been tossed out of Federal District Court in the first instance. Instead, its stakes are now heightened enormously. If the justices approach their task as judges and not as politicians, the administration will easily prevail. It is the Roberts court that now needs to take care."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont are both playing to win the Democratic primary here, and there may already be a handful of losers in their battle: the mainstream Republican candidates.Bear with me here.In most states, Republican and Democratic primaries unfold on different tracks. But in New Hampshire, the states open primary creates a strange tug of war between candidates in opposite parties, as they fight over a shared group of political independents who can vote in either primary.A Democratic candidate who wins over independents may do more than pick up support in her own campaign. She may also pull away votes from a moderate Republican pursuing the same constituency.Had Mrs. Clinton won Iowa by a big margin, some of the drama might have left the Democratic contest here, releasing a sliver of centrist and left-of-center independents to vote on the Republican side.Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio has organized his campaign around attracting those voters. So, too, to some extent, have Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But the stronger Mrs. Clinton looks in her fight with Mr. Sanders, and the more assertively she positions herself toward the political center, the more votes she is likely to shave away from every Republican not named Ted Cruz or Donald J. Trump.It happens routinely in campaign events here: A candidate finishes his speech by praising the Granite State electorate. He hails the unique seriousness with which voters here embrace democracy. In other states, he says, theyre not like you.But when he begins taking questions, only a few minutes go by before someone in the audience begins, I came in from Massachusetts this morning In a small state like New Hampshire, in easy driving distance of cities across New England, a political circus of this scale attracts no small number of tourists. Some hail from even farther away. One questioner at a town-hall-style meeting with Mr. Christie on Monday introduced herself as an undecided independent voter. I drove the furthest, she said. I came from Montana.For candidates, the interlopers are, at worst, a small distraction from wooing actual New Hampshire voters. But for reporters looking to gauge the energy and momentum around a candidate, the influx of outsiders can be deceptive.The large crowds at Mr. Trumps campaign events are studded with voters from Massachusetts or Maine who freely admit that they drove in to see a great show. None of them can vote on Feb. 9.New Hampshires special status turns local officeholders and community leaders into political kingmakers. Endorsements do not come only from senators and governors: The owner of a popular local restaurant can be a prized recruit in a presidential campaign.The role of an endorser, however, is not necessarily a glamorous one. Leaving a Kasich campaign event, I spotted a dignified gentleman with white hair handing out pamphlets. He looked like Gordon J. Humphrey, but surely it could not be?It was. Mr. Humphrey, 75, a former two-term senator from New Hampshire, is an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Kasich. Asked if distributing leaflets was below his pay grade, Mr. Humphrey insisted it was not. He said he would do whatever he could to help his candidate.When Mr. Humphrey first ran for the Senate, in 1978, he was the consummate political outsider. An airline pilot by training, he ran on a strident conservative message and he won. Yet the Republican primary race this year, defined by Mr. Trumps incendiary rhetoric, has been too much for him.It is out of control, Mr. Humphrey said. We now have candidates who are appealing to base emotions on a scale never before seen. Thats out of control."}

{"text": "When Steve Forbes ran for president in 1996 on a plan that called for no taxes on dividends and capital gains, Mitt Romney, then a private citizen, took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe attacking his proposal as plutocratic.The Forbes tax isnt a flat tax at all  its a tax cut for fat cats! Mr. Romneys ad declared, noting that Kennedys, Rockefellers and Forbes could end up with a tax rate of zero, while ordinary people would be left paying 17 percent on their wage and salary income under Mr. Forbess plan.The mainstream Republican position on capital gains has long been that they should be taxed at a low rate, but not zero. In 1996, Mr. Romney was supporting Bob Dole, the eventual nominee, whose campaign platform called for a 14 percent tax rate on capital gains. In 2003, President George W. Bush signed a law setting the rate at 15 percent, a policy that John McCain proposed to continue if elected in 2008. (The current maximum rate on capital gains is 23.8 percent, after tax increases that took effect in 2013.)When Mr. Romney was the Republican nominee in 2012, he proposed to abolish the capital gains tax for moderate earners  who typically have few capital gains anyway  but not for the Kennedys, Rockefellers and Forbeses, who would have continued paying 15 percent.But the once-fringe idea of abolishing a capital-gains tax is going mainstream this year courtesy of Senator Marco Rubio. His tax plan breaks with past establishment Republican candidates for president in its extreme generosity to taxpayers who derive their income from investments rather than work.His plan would impose no tax at all on interest, dividends or capital gain income from stocks. It would also set a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on business income, both for large corporations and small ones. In many cases, that would mean business owners would pay a lower tax rate on profits than their employees would pay on their wages  even after counting both taxes paid by the business and those paid by the business owner directly.Mr. Rubios tax plan has drawn attention for so-called family-friendly features, including a significantly expanded child tax credit. It has also drawn criticism from Senator Ted Cruz for imposing too high a tax rate on wage income  rates of up to 35 percent. Mr. Rubio seeks a lower top rate than is imposed today, but one higher than any other current Republican presidential candidate has proposed. Mr. Cruzs plan, which combines a flat income tax with a value-added tax, would impose an effective combined tax rate of 24.4 percent on wages.The fight over taxes mirrors the divide that has emerged between the Republican Partys elite supporters and its voter base. Mr. Cruzs and Donald Trumps tax plans offer significantly lower tax rates than Mr. Rubios to the sorts of highly paid workers that form a key Republican voting constituency. But they are not as generous to people who live off investment income  a group that, not incidentally, includes many of the people who fund Republican super PACs.To be clear, the idea that capital gains should get a preferential tax rate did not arise as a pure sop to the rich. For nearly the entire history of the American income tax, capital gains have been taxed at a lower rate than regular income. Canada, France, Britain, Germany and even Sweden all impose top tax rates on capital gains that are more than 10 points lower than their top rates on regular income.Reduced tax rates on capital income serve three plausible policy purposes beyond being nice for the Rockefellers and the Kennedys. First, a large fraction of capital income is taxed twice, at the corporate and individual levels. Dividends are distributions of already-taxed corporate profits, while a rise in a stock price represents a rise in expected future taxable corporate profits. Second, economists generally believe the revenue-maximizing tax rate on capital gains is much lower than the revenue-maximizing tax rate on salaries. This is in large part because capital gains are voluntary; you pay only if you sell an appreciated asset, so investors are likely to respond to higher tax rates by not selling.Third, and more controversially, some economists say capital is significantly more sensitive to tax policy than labor. That is, high taxes on capital income will do more to discourage investment than high taxes on wages do to discourage work. Capital taxes are therefore more damaging to the economy than wage taxes.Unfortunately, recent experience with capital tax cuts has not been supportive of the idea that they will do much to lift economic growth. There seems to have been virtually no impact of the 2001 or 2003 tax cuts on capital, said William Gale, co-director at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former staff member at the Council of Economic Advisers under George H.W. Bush. He pointed to a 2015 paper from the University of California, Berkeley, economist Danny Yagan, finding that the 2003 cut in dividend taxes caused zero change in corporate investment and employee compensation.The problem with proposing a zero tax rate on capital gains and dividends, rather than just a low one, is that it can rely only on the third, least-certain justification. A zero rate will more than offset the double taxation of corporate income, and is certainly well below the revenue-maximizing rate.But its a big tax cut for people who are already doing well, and can be a good idea only if you really believe it will do a lot for economic growth."}
{"text": "DeRay Mckesson, whose activism over the last year and a half has vaulted him from obscure Twitter sage to a political force in the national Black Lives Matter movement, announced Wednesday that he was running for mayor of Baltimore.His entry is a step into the mainstream for a national movement that has been criticized for a lack of organized structure and tactics. His candidacy is sure to jolt the political and protest communities at a time when activists have eschewed traditional politics and sought to work outside the system.Mr. Mckesson, a Baltimore native who will run as a Democrat, faces an uphill climb.He is diving, relatively late, into a crowded race of about a dozen candidates. Among them are prominent black leaders including Nick J. Mosby, a city councilman and the husband of the prosecutor who is trying six police officers in the death of a young black Baltimore man last year, and Sheila Dixon, the former mayor who remains popular even though she left office after a conviction on fraud charges. David L. Warnock, a prominent businessman, also is vying for the nomination.The Democratic victor of the primary on April 26 is almost assured of winning the general election for an office that the party has controlled for nearly half a century.In a statement, Mr. Mckesson said that he was running to challenge the normal order of governing in the city. We cannot rely on traditional pathways to politics and the traditional politicians who walk that path, he wrote. We have to challenge the practices that have not and will not lead to transformation.Mr. Mckesson, 30, rose to prominence in the movement that emerged after a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Mr. Mckesson was quickly on the ground in Missouri, providing sharp, continuous Twitter missives challenging what he and many others saw as a racist law enforcement regime.At the center of the mayors race will be issues of race and policing in a predominantly black city that saw riots and mass demonstrations last year after 25-year-old Freddie Gray died of injuries sustained in police custody.Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was criticized for her handling of the unrest that followed. She is not running for re-election.Mr. Mckessons supporters herald him for helping shed light on national issues of police abuse and misconduct. His detractors, however, tag him as an antipolice anarchist whose comments helped foster spasms of protest violence in cities across the country where blacks have died at the hands of law enforcement. Mr. Mckesson also has critics in the movement, who argue that he is too cozy with the establishment (he has met with both Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as well as Valerie Jarrett, one of President Obamas top advisers) and too much of a celebrity. (He is one of 10 people whom Beyonc follows on Twitter.)He left his job as an administrator in the Minneapolis Public Schools to move to the St. Louis area to work as a full-time activist. He then traveled around the country, turning to Twitter to chronicle protests against racial injustice. He has since returned to his hometown, Baltimore.His decision to run may help pacify critics who have said that the Black Lives Matter movement is too diffuse and that the new crop of activists are ineffective in creating change. Older generations of civil rights activists have applauded the Black Lives Matter activists for bringing awareness to the issues facing blacks today. But they also ask: Now what?I was a civil rights activist, and we had specific goals, specific things that we wanted to see happen, said Elbert Walton, 73, a political insider in St. Louis.New activists jumping into the electoral fray would be a positive sign, Mr. Walton added, because it would mean that they understood that their problem was a government problem and that they had to take control of government."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  The landscape for Silicon Valley may have become rockier over the last several months. But that has not stopped venture capital firms from raising new money to pour into start-ups.The latest is Index Ventures, which announced on Wednesday that it had closed its eighth venture capital fund at $550 million, up slightly from the normal size for the funds earmarked for early-stage investments.Coupled with a $700 million fund that focuses on later-stage growth investments, the total of Indexs latest fund-raising efforts is more than $1.2 billion  seemingly a lot at a time when venture capitalists have become worried that sky-high valuations for start-ups have started to crumble.Yet Mike Volpi, a partner at Index, said that the current environment had not shaken the confidence of the firm. Index focuses primarily on investing in the seed and early stages of a companys life, leaving the firm less exposed to later fluctuations in that start-ups value.Moreover, he contends, the investment strategy gives the firm a longer time horizon that is less tied to the vicissitudes of the present.Obviously, the climate is certainly different today, but since were going to be investing this fund over, say, the next three-and-a-half years, things will look differently than they do today, he said.The current environment, he added, doesnt affect us too much, except at the margins.At the same time, Mr. Volpi said, having valuations come down can swing negotiating leverage  and, hopefully, returns  in favor of investors.Index has been slower to spend money from its growth fund, Mr. Volpi added.We raised it just as valuations were starting to shift, he said. Weve made one or two investments out of that fund.As part of the fund-raising announcement, Index also said that it had promoted Shardul Shah, who joined eight years ago, to partner. Last week, the firm said that it had hired Dick Costolo, the former chief executive of Twitter, as a partner as well."}
{"text": "Martin Shkreli was back in federal court on Wednesday, and for a change the brash New York businessman, who is facing securities fraud charges, had little to say.Dressed in white chinos and a navy blazer, Mr. Shkreli sat quietly during a short appearance to discuss the status of his pending criminal case. Yes, judge, he said in response to a question from Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto of Federal District Court in Brooklyn.In the future, Mr. Shkreli, who has frequently posted on Twitter and appeared in live-stream videos since his arrest in December, may be a lot less visible and vocal. Benjamin Brafman, his new defense lawyer, said he had told his client to adopt a lower profile and stop granting interviews to the news media.Mr. Brafman said after the court proceeding that he expected Mr. Shkreli to largely comply with his advice to stop talking.That would also appear to include a congressional hearing on Thursday to which Mr. Shkreli was subpoenaed to discuss the issue of big price increases in the pharmaceutical industry.Mr. Brafman said in a phone interview after the hearing that his client would assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has told Mr. Brafman that Mr. Shkreli must appear on Capitol Hill to assert his constitutional right in person.The committee subpoenaed Mr. Shkreli to ask him questions about the decision by Turing Pharmaceuticals to raise the price of a decades-old drug by 5,000 percent shortly after the company that Mr. Shkreli used to lead acquired the rights to the drug.The testimony before the committee is not expected to touch on the fraud charges pending against Mr. Shkreli, which involve an allegation that he looted another pharmaceutical company, Retrophin, to pay back investors in former hedge funds he once ran.In a somewhat related action, Retrophin, which fired Mr. Shkreli as chief executive in 2014, agreed this week to settle a lawsuit brought by investors who claimed that the company had concealed transactions that benefited Mr. Shkreli. In agreeing to settle the dispute, Retrophin pledged to pay $3 million to the investors.A federal judge in Manhattan gave preliminary approval to the settlement on Tuesday and will hold a hearing on June 10 to decide whether to give the deal final approval.The accusations in the investor lawsuit bear some resemblance to allegations in the indictment filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn against Mr. Shkreli. Recently unsealed documents in the criminal case reveal that prosecutors began investigating Mr. Shkrelis activities at Retrophin in May 2014, when a grand jury issued its first subpoena seeking documents and records. It was not until October of that year that Retrophins board ousted Mr. Shkreli.On Wednesday the court also heard that Mr. Shkreli is worth a lot less than he was just a month ago.Prosecutors disclosed in court that the assets in several brokerage accounts at E-Trade that were posted as security for Mr. Shkrelis bail of $5 million have shrunk considerably. The accounts, which once totaled about $45 million, are now worth a little under $5 million.The bail order requires E-Trade to notify prosecutors anytime the value of the assets in the accounts falls below $5 million. If the account value dips further, prosecutors said it could prompt a reassessment of Mr. Shkrelis bail terms.Much of the decline in the E-Trade account is a result of the collapse in the price of shares of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, another company that Mr. Shkreli briefly led, authorities said. The stock, once valued at more than $30 a share, is trading at around $2. KaloBios fired Mr. Shkreli after he was indicted, and the company filed for bankruptcy in late December.Days before Mr. Shkreli was arrested, KaloBios raised about $8 million from a group of investors in a private placement of stock. Some of the investors in that offering, called private investment in public equity, are suing in United States Bankruptcy Court for the return of their money, claiming they were misled by the company and Mr. Shkreli."}

Ho! Lets Go: Ramones and the Birth of Punk, a retrospective exhibition that will examine the groups influence on both music and art, as part of a spate of spring programming under the museums new director, Laura Raicovich, that focuses on Queens as a Petri dish of global culture.The Ramones show, organized with the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, where a second part of the exhibition will open on Sept. 16, will include more than 350 objects, from the bands archives and those of Arturo Vega, who designed the bands logo; from artists like Shepard Fairey and Yoshitomo Nara; and from Mad magazine and Punk magazine, to demonstrate, as the museum says, how the Ramones served as both subject and inspiration for many visual artists, resulting in a large body of works. (Marky Ramone, who replaced Tommy as the groups drummer, was born in Brooklyn.)The Queens show, which continues through July 31, will open concurrently with the museums Queens International, its biannual exhibition, held since 2001, that showcases artists who live or work in Queens, and a show devoted to the writer and activist Rebecca Solnit. Her Atlas books have used mapping as a new way to think about the cultural and political life of cities. This year Nonstop Metropolis, the third book in her series, after San Francisco and New Orleans, will take New York City as its subject, and Ms. Solnit will organize a series of unorthodox works and public programs with the artists Mariam Ghani and Duke Riley.The museums 2016 programming will culminate on Sept. 19 with the opening of the first New York retrospective of the five-decade career of Mierle Laderman Ukeles. A pioneering environmentalist and feminist artist, Ms. Ukeles is best known for her role over more than three decades as the official, unsalaried artist-in-residence at New York Citys Department of Sanitation, where she has created collaborative pieces known as work ballets, in which municipal workers use their heavy-duty vehicles in performance."}
{"text": "Never mind the name: The electric-guitar quartet Dither got straight to the point on Tuesday at the Stone. From the propulsive opening of Dreaming of Vermont, by Joshua Lopes, one of the groups members, the stage was set for an evening of sophisticated, hard-driving and stylistically omnivorous music making.During its weeklong residence at this Lower East Side space, the ensemble is performing music by composers including John Zorn (the Stones founder), Phill Niblock and Cornelius Cardew, and joining forces with performers like the pianist Kathleen Supov and the brass ensemble Tilt.But on Tuesday the program consisted entirely of works written by Dithers members, who, as well as Mr. Lopes, are Taylor Levine, James Moore and Gyan Riley.The ensemble delivered many of the elements you might expect from a consort of electric guitars, like growling chords, squealing feedback and flamboyant riffs, alongside the rhythmic discipline honed in more conventional contemporary classical music. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of the concert was the exploration of intergroup dynamics. These ranged from the fierce one-upmanship of Mr. Levines Renegade, with its flamingly virtuosic solos delivered over hard-jolting, irregular chords, to the silky blend of Mr. Moores Mannequin. In that work, the players used E-bows  battery-powered resonators that allow a guitarist to glide smoothly from one note to another  in order to wilt and bend pitches gently away from a common note.The effect was like listening to petals curl off a bud.Mr. Lopess Pantagruel also opened with a unison burst of energy before shimmying along the border between nervous aggression and a certain floppy-limbed swagger. Mr. Rileys The Tar of Gyu upended the notion that electric guitars command only blocklike dynamics  that on-or-off quality of amplification  with crescendos on single chords that puffed up grotesquely before coming to abrupt stops.This plasticity of sound, which, in subtler form, is one of Dithers hallmarks, required an extraordinarily complex amount of footwork on a battery of pedals and switches arranged in front of the musicians chairs. Mr. Lopess evocative Head Down, Eyes Averted became a study in the expressive potential of reverb, with subtle trills and little scratches along the length of the strings flitting in and out of the clouds of dissipating resonance."}
{"text": "When the day finally came, Cesar Vargas cried. His mother cried. His law professors cried.His four-year legal fight to become a lawyer ended on Wednesday in a gilded courtroom in Brooklyn. There, Mr. Vargas, a 32-year-old Mexican immigrant without legal status, was sworn in along with 67 others as the newest members of the New York State Bar.After the ceremony at the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn Heights, Mr. Vargas, held the certificate of admittance he had purchased for $5 as proof, and embraced his mother, Teresa Galindo. She started weeping. So did he.Because, Ms. Galindo, 72, said, the child that I took by the hand crossing the border is now a lawyer.With immigration reform stalled in Congress and the presidents executive action to provide legal protections to some undocumented immigrants currently up for review by the Supreme Court, Mr. Vargass achievement offered hope for immigration activists.I see it as a victory personally for Cesar Vargas, but for immigrants everywhere, particularly for Dreamers, for those whose legal status is not of their own doing and who seek full inclusion in what is only their home, this country, said Michelle J. Anderson, the dean of the City University of New York School of Law, who taught Mr. Vargas and witnessed the ceremony.Ms. Anderson added, choking up, Hes an amazing kid.The second youngest of eight children, Mr. Vargas was 5 when he crossed the border from Tijuana to San Diego.He grew up on Staten Island and graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn. After law school, Mr. Vargas passed the New York State bar exam in 2011 on his first try. He applied for admission to the bar in 2012, but was rebuffed by the bars Committee on Character and Fitness because of his immigration status. His application was then referred to the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.In 2013 he gained temporary protection from deportation as part of President Obamas program for children who came illegally with a parent and became an activist for immigration reform, founding the Dream Action Coalition.In June, an appellate panel of the State Supreme Court voted unanimously to grant his bar application, making Mr. Vargas the first immigrant without legal status to be allowed entry into the bar. But there was a problem: He had been arrested in January 2015 while protesting during a political program in Iowa, interrupting Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.Mr. Vargas was sentenced in June to a year of probation, which was cut to six months in December. His record was expunged, clearing the way for admission to the bar.I must admit, there were moments where I felt defeated; there were moments where I thought I was not going to be a lawyer, Mr. Vargas said at a news conference in the cafeteria of his undergraduate alma mater, St. Francis College.Jose Perez, the deputy general counsel of Latino Justice PRLDEF, a legal advocacy group that represented Mr. Vargas, said Mr. Vargas was already an example. The general counsel of the Utah State Bar called Mr. Perez recently, asking him what to do in similar cases in which students were undocumented.They realize that the Legislature doesnt necessarily need to act, that typically in their state the judiciary determines bar admission and eligibility, Mr. Perez said.On Wednesday, before swearing in the 68 lawyers standing in front of him, Justice Randall T. Eng said that he was brought to the United States from China as an infant, which proved that birthplace was not an obstacle. He then asked how many of the lawyers had been born outside the United States. At least eight people raised their hands.Mr. Vargas was touched by Justice Engs speech. It was like he paraphrased the decision, Mr. Vargas said, referring to the June decision in which the appellate court wrote: Mr. Vargas undocumented immigration status, in and of itself, does not reflect adversely upon his general fitness to practice law. No matter where you are born, you can be a lawyer.Mr. Vargas is now a Latino-outreach strategist for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Vargas will not be practicing law until after the November elections because he is busy on the campaign trail. Yet despite the days celebrations, with tamales his mother made, he said his future wasuncertain.I could still be deported any time, Mr. Vargas said in a quiet moment. If Trump was elected, he could deport me and my family. I am still undocumented."}
{"text": "Fashion is experiencing another designer exodus.On Monday morning, Kerings Italian mens wear brand, Brioni, and its creative director, Brendan Mullane, released a statement saying that they had reached a joint decision not to renew their working collaboration. Hours later, Berluti said that its chief designer, Alessandro Sartori, was leaving the LVMH-owned mens luxury label nine days after presenting his latest fall collection at Paris Fashion Week.Speculation then turned to the rival house Ermenegildo Zegna as Mr. Sartoris new posting after weeks of talk that its designer, Stefano Pilati, would be leaving after three years at the helm. On Tuesday, Zegna declined to comment on the topic.A domino effect has come into play this week, and I feel very confident that at least one will end up moving to the former house of another, said Armando Branchini, the vice chairman of the Italian luxury lobby Fondazione Altagamma, after the news broke.Coming months after the designer shake-up in womens wear at Balenciaga, Dior and Lanvin, the sudden shift in the mens wear market underscores the industrys growing volatility when it comes to creative direction. But unlike the designer-auteur exits that took place in womens wear, where the intensity of the workload was widely cited as a contributing factor, the reasons behind the turmoil this week are less clear. And, according to Mr. Branchini, they are of less concern to the industry.I dont believe that these designer moves will have any impact on the market, he said. One must remember that this is mens wear. The impact of creative directors in this sector is far more limited than in womens wear. If anything, this trend just reinforces that while creative directors are instrumental when first changing a brands culture as part of a revamp, once a vision is established, the long-term development falls to the C.E.O. and executive team.Certainly in the case of Berluti, run by Antoine Arnault since 2011, the departure of Mr. Sartori is not linked to the quality of the companys recent performance.Berluti generated less than 30 million euros ($32.6 million) in revenue in 2011, when Mr. Sartori first joined, and has added more than 100 million ($109 million) to that figure today, having expanded its product offering, bought a custom atelier and increased its global store network to 46 boutiques, including big-ticket flagships on Madison Avenue in New York and Conduit Street in London. Mr. Sartori, with his elegant, finely detailed suits, experimentations with color and introduction of four-figure sneakers, appeared to be trying to court a younger crowd with more youthful styles as the industrys enthusiasm for the growth opportunities in luxury mens wear rose.In five years with Alessandro, we have created a strong brand while respecting the Berluti DNA, Mr. Arnault told The New York Times after news broke that his designer, whom he had hired in 2011 from the since-closed Z Zegna line, was leaving.The house is playing an important role in the mens wear industry, and we will continue in that direction, Mr. Arnault said.A spokesman for Mr Porter, the luxury mens wear e-commerce site and exclusive online dealer of Berluti, confirmed Monday night that the group saw the brand as successful for us. He said the same for Brioni, where Mr. Mullane had also been forging a younger, cooler aesthetic as part of a renaissance at a traditional luxury bastion since his appointment in 2012, the same year the house was acquired by Kering.Brendans passion, vision and charisma always emerged through his work, and we are very grateful for his dedicated commitment to the company, said Gianluca Flore, Brionis chief executive. He added that a new creative director would be appointed in in due time, and that the brands spring 2017 collection in June would be developed by an in-house design team.I wish Brioni the future it deserves among the best luxury brands, said Mr. Mullane, formerly the head mens wear designer at Givenchy.Times have been tougher, at least publicly, at Zegna, which has almost 500 stores worldwide and lower average prices than Brioni and Berluti. Hit by Chinas economic slowdown (the country makes up a third of the brands total sales) and currency fluctuations last year, the group said it would reduce capital spending while introducing new products at both the top and bottom of its target market.The collections of Mr. Pilati, the former designer of Yves Saint Laurent, who joined Zegna in 2012 as head of design, often received critical acclaim. But with suits in the couture collection starting at $5,000, they have also been seen as too expensive for the majority of Zegna customers. Whether he, too, will leave remains to be seen. Many say that he wishes to return to his roots in womens wear.But with the growing number of high fashion houses that are forging ahead without star designers at the helm, questions will arise about the shifting boardroom-design studio dynamic and the longstanding partnership model that has underpinned the luxury business.There have now been numerous instances in this industry where without a lead designer, the shows have gone on regardless, Mr. Branchini said.And from a business perspective, sales and turnover have progressed in spite of a lack of a star name. Increasingly, the role of a single designer once a superbrand is on cruise control is becoming less and less important."}

{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO  Brazils government is considering tightening the guidelines it currently gives doctors, hospitals, and health care providers for when to report infants born with abnormally small heads, a move intended to reduce the number of false alarms that it has received in wake of the Zika epidemic gripping Brazil.In the last few months, the nation has been grappling with a growing surge in medical reports of microcephaly, a rare condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads. According to data released this week by the Ministry of Health, there have been 4,783 reported cases since October last year.Before that, the nation had about 150 annually.But how many of the babies actually have microcephaly  and whether the condition was caused by the Zika virus  is still far from clear.Of the cases examined so far, 404 have been confirmed as having microcephaly.Only 17 of them tested positive for the Zika virus. But the government and many researchers say that number may be largely irrelevant, because their tests would find the presence of the virus in only a tiny percentage of cases.An additional 709 babies have been ruled out as having microcephaly, according to the government, underscoring the risks of false positives making the epidemic appear larger than it actually is.The remaining 1,113 cases are still being investigated.In a recorded message to the nation that was broadcast on Wednesday night, President Dilma Rousseff said each federal public official has to transform into a combatant against the mosquito and its reproduction.As is often the case with global health epidemics, the numbers have caused confusion. Some have wondered if Brazil was overstating the extent of its health crisis.But several independent experts said that many of the false positives were the result of an appropriate amount of caution and care by the Brazilian authorities.The government began requiring local health officials to report suspected cases of microcephaly in October. It did so after doctors in Zika-stricken areas began seeing an alarming increase in babies being born with unusually small heads and the brain damage that often comes with it. Brazilian researchers then linked the condition to the virus, which had only recently made its way to Brazil.The government originally told health professionals to report suspected microcephaly cases when a babys head at birth was 33 centimeters, or 13 inches, or less. At that time, very little was known about the virus and its possible effects on pregnancy, so officials here did what is common in public health surveillance cases: They set broad criteria to make sure they were catching as many cases as possible.But that standard also meant that there were many false positives of babies being reported who were actually healthy, said Claudio Maierovitch, director of the department of surveillance of communicable diseases at Brazils health ministry.The protocol was initiated in October, when we had many doubts about what we were investigating, he said. Several experts agreed with the decision.In the beginning of an epidemic, it is better to have a sensitive parameter and include a lot of false positives, said Dr. Celina Turchi, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist in the state of Pernambuco. Too much sensitivity and too many false positives is the way to go when you dont know whats going on.The government then changed the threshold to 32 centimeters in December, after concluding that there were many babies with small heads but without problems, Dr. Maierovitch noted.But even after introducing the stricter standards, the number of reported microcephaly cases continued to climb rapidly.Now, the nations Ministry of Health is discussing lowering the limit for head circumference for newborns again  to 31.9 centimeters for boys and 31.5 centimeters for girls  after a recommendation by medical groups that the agency met with in Braslia last week.Maria Teresa Vieira Sanseverino, a pediatrician and medical geneticist who attended the meeting, said that, there was consensus among the medical groups that the current criteria is too broad and is drawing too many false positives.One consequence of the new standard could be a significant drop in the number of reported cases.The alarming rise in microcephaly and possible link to the Zika virus reached new importance this week when the World Health Organization declared the situation an international health emergency. It warned that as many as four million people in the Americas could be infected.Dr. Arthur Reingold, the head of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, said that Brazil is taking a perfectly reasonable approach.Dr. Lavinia Schuler Faccini, president of Brazilian Society of Medical Genetics, was among those who pushed to change the head circumference to 32 centimeters in December. She also supports the new criteria being discussed.Still, she does not fault the original protocol, saying that the Ministry did what it should have done in such matters.Otherwise, she said, Wed be wondering, have we lost some children?

{"text": "A New York police officer who sued the city after 12 other officers beat him in his home and detained him in 2010 was awarded over $15 million in damages on Wednesday, his lawyer said.A spokesman for the citys Law Department, Nick Paolucci, said that the verdict was still in process and that a series of post-trial motions and questions could alter the outcome of the case.Larry Jackson, the plaintiff, was off duty in August 2010 when his wife called 911 to report that an armed man had crashed a party at their home in Queens and was engaged in an argument with a group of guests.Mr. Jackson, who is black, defused the situation and got the gunman to leave before the police arrived, but the scene was nevertheless chaotic when they did, according to court documents.A second argument erupted among the partygoers soon after the police arrived, and a melee ensued. A brief video submitted to the court showed tremendous commotion inside the plaintiffs home with people on the floor and the police struggling to both restrain and repel people, according to a March 2014 memorandum prepared by the federal judge, Pamela K. Chen.Mr. Jackson ended up in handcuffs along with three other party guests and was detained at the 113th Precinct station house in Jamaica, Queens, although his detention was not formally processed as an arrest. He received medical care for a broken hand while in police custody, at a Queens hospital.Mr. Jackson filed a lawsuit against the city in June 2011 accusing the officers of an array of violations, including racial discrimination, assault and battery, false arrest and unlawful detention. Lawyers for the city have denied the allegations.They would treat a dog better than they treated Jackson, said Eric Sanders, a lawyer for Mr. Jackson and himself a former police officer. Ive never seen anything like this and Ive been around law enforcement a long time. Its disgraceful what they did.The $15.175 million verdict on Wednesday includes $12.5 million for compensatory damages and $2.6 million for punitive damages. Mr. Jackson remains employed as a city police officer on full duty, Mr. Sanders said."}

The authorities said at the time that she had recorded a confession to the crime on video, but investigators believed she had not acted alone.It is unclear how she knew Mr. Maisonett, who, according to the police, has been arrested multiple times in recent years on charges including burglary, assault and criminal possession of a controlled substance."}
{"text": "In the opening shot of this newly restored 1965 Italian film, the camera moves snakelike across a deserted, litter-strewn beach, finally resting on a beautiful woman, sunbathing and asleep, a droning transistor radio next to her head. This shot is arguably a distillation of the writer-director Antonio Pietrangelis entire picture, but the subsequent 113 minutes are very much worth sticking around for.Starring Stefania Sandrelli, not yet 20 at the time, I Knew Her Well chronicles the life of the would-be starlet Adriana as she sometimes blithely, sometimes sadly negotiates a rise from peasant life to Romes not entirely dolce vita.Mr. Pietrangelis New Wave-inflected, choppily fast-forwarding style depicts Adriana as a kind of unattached Emma Bovary, sometimes clearheaded, sometimes empty-headed. Ms. Sandrelli, in a variety of wigs and costumes, is never less than hypnotically beautiful. Mr. Pietrangelis perspective could be said to split the difference between the analytic detachment of early-60s Antonioni and the political anger of late-60s/early-70s Bertolucci. (Ms. Sandrelli herself achieved worldwide fame in Mr. Bertoluccis The Conformist in 1970.)But I Knew Her Well, never before released in the United States, ultimately speaks in a register of its own, and while its hardly subtle, it is compelling. One of the stronger stories within its story features Ugo Tognazzi as a washed-up on-screen Lothario of an earlier generation, and its a devastating bit. On the other hand, the movies condemnation of image-making and celebrity glamour calls up a faintly amusing contradiction in its casting of a young, gorgeous Franco Nero as a parking garage attendant and mechanic.In any event, this black-and-white films pictorial quality alone justifies the price of admission."}
{"text": "For no particular reason other than the romance of the idea, the writer and Ts deputy editor Hanya Yanagihara traversed the entire islands mostly polite  and at times, dark  waters.IT RAINED ON my first day of swimming across Marthas Vineyard. This wasnt a surprise: It was the end of September, when the weather can shift in an hour from Icelandic to Malibuan, and for days before, my best friend, J., who was accompanying me on my journey, had been emailing me projected forecasts, followed each time by the same hopeful message: Maybe we should cancel?The pond in which I would begin my swim is called Menemsha, and is the second-westernmost body of water along the islands southern shore. J.s family has a house up the hill from it, and it was while I was staying there, six summers before, that I had decided that one day I would reenact a version of John Cheevers short story The Swimmer by swimming across the entire length of the island, a 20-mile-long necklace of skinny fingers of land linking dozens of saltwater lakes and ponds, so many of them that when you look at a map, the coastline resembles something thats been nibbled on by a family of mice.In Cheevers story, Neddy Merrill, a golden man who seemed to have the especial slenderness of youth, decides to swim home from his friends house one midsummer afternoon, working his way through the chlorinated pools of East Coast suburbia, first with permission, and then without  Neddy lives in Bullet Park, Cheevers fictional Westchester town, a rotten utopia  only to discover, alongside the reader, that his life as he envisions it no longer exists. It is a WASPy incarnation of magical realism: a Puritan horror story in which a man comes to realize the unbearably fragile fiction of his own life in the span of a day spent dipping into pools and wandering across his neighbors lawns.In my version, there were no pools, or patronizing neighbors, or tinkling of cocktail stirrers; there was only my stubborn and whimsical desire. As with many romantic and quixotic ideas, there was no point to my trip. And yet ever since I had imagined it, there had been the idea: an island full of lakes, and I would swim across it, because when youre a swimmer and theres water, you get in. There was, I felt, an inevitability to this swim.And so here I was, at the lip of Menemsha, the first of the ponds. From here, I would swim through Stonewall (a tiny thing: a hole dug out of the mud and washed with seawater) and then Tisbury Great Pond, then across the narrow tip of Edgartown Great Pond, and, finally, Katama Bay on the eastern end of the island: about 6.5 miles in total. The trip would demand some trespassing  most of the ponds are encircled, or nearly, by private land  but of a relatively mild degree.The sky was the color of steel. Already the island had a lonely, end-of-the-world feel to it, that almost palpable melancholy that infects East Coast islands every autumn and lingers until the early summer. Two canoes, in weather-faded shades of almost-white and once-aqua, trembled in the wind. The water was blanketed with a yard-deep layer of frilly khaki seaweed so thick that I fancied I could walk across it, and was insultingly, violently cold. I began my swim feeling resentful.But unlike other forms of physical exertion, the comfort of swimming is that it becomes gentler, kinder, as you keep doing it, because it asks only for the simplest of heroics from your body, and with every minute you remain in the water, in movement, you can almost feel your dumb animal self taking over, warming yourself to the waters temperature, allowing you to surrender to its offer of weightlessness.A half an hour later, when Id almost reached the opposite shore, I looked back and saw J. paddling toward me, a speck of green, ready to tug me to shore if I needed help. But by that time I was already where I was meant to be: the point in the swim in which one forgets that ones habitat is actually land.SWIMMING IS the writers sport, because it is the sport most like writing. To swim, as to write, is to choose an intense state of socially acceptable aloneness. You can be a serious runner or bicyclist and still have to occasionally nod at a passerby or negotiate traffic. Swimming, however, precludes interaction with the world. When Anne Sexton won a fellowship from Radcliffe in 1961, she used the money to build herself a pool, which has always seemed to me a sensible artistic decision, if those two adjectives can ever be paired.And yet both activities also cultivate a sort of mental busyness: If, say, yoga encourages the absence of thought, swimming encourages its presence. There is no better place to unkink a complicated piece of invented logic than in the water  there is little else to do, in fact, but confront your problems. If you are an open-water swimmer, the sport also demands a particular kind of mental discipline, one in which you must simultaneously indulge your imagination while also asserting control over it. The fear and exhaustion of swimming in the ocean is not struggling against the currents or tide, but the effort it takes to not notice how dark the water beneath you has become, and then, failing that, to assure yourself that its only the shadow of a cloud scudding above you. Nowhere but in the sea are you so ceaselessly reminded that something you love so much doesnt care about you at all.Swimming in a pond, though, is different: safer, more predictable, less exciting, but also less tiring. Swimming in the ocean is writing a novel; swimming in a pond is writing in a diary. All swimming is performative, in its way, but swimming in a pool is most performative of all. It certainly is in The Swimmer: a performance that Neddy mounts for himself; a performance he mounts for his neighbors. And yet every time a swimmer puts her head under water, there is a moment in which she can believe that the world as it is has disappeared, because in a very real sense, it has: She is in another universe, one where even breath and gravity are different. The hallucinatory quality, the elasticity of time in Cheevers story, always made sense to me because it captures what every swimmer both anticipates and dreads  that someday, you will lift your head from the water, and this time, after all the thousands of times before it, the world that reappears before you will not be the one you left.AFTER MENEMSHA, after Stonewall, there was Tisbury Great Pond. And so early on the second day, we drove to the pond, which abuts a nature reserve.The weather had changed overnight, the sky was merry and bright. We were the only ones in sight. On either side of the dirt path we walked on toward the pond were fields of yarrow, bright as buttercups and, above them, swooping flocks of blackbirds, smudges of ominous black upsetting the blue. Lets pretend were the last people on earth, I told J. Lets pretend were in The Road and were searching for shelter. Lets pretend were in Oryx and Crake and on the run from the pigoons.No, thats O.K., J. said.In order to access the pond, which is mostly surrounded by marshes, we had to walk around it, alongside the sea, and then cut across the dunes. Marthas Vineyards ponds are chimeric; not quite the sea, not quite not the sea. When the day is windy, their surfaces pleat with convincing waves, and when the day is still, they are disconcertingly flat and quiet. They have seaweed, like the ocean, and ducks, like lakes. They are surrounded by real sand, and yet their bottoms are mucky, sucking silt. The sand around Tisbury Great Pond was coarse, like brown sugar, and scattered with freshly dead squid, presumably dropped by birds but not yet eaten and not yet festering, and the water  once I kicked past the skeins of seaweed  was brown and sweet and vaguely vegetal-tasting, like cool barley tea. It was easy water to swim in, placid and yielding and vaguely furry. When you are swimming in chlorine, you can feel the water tracing its presence on your skin, reminding you with each movement that you are disrupting its equilibrium, that you are foreign to it. But this water was polite; it grazed you but then let you move on. It was accommodating in a way that was definitely un-sealike.The ancient people of Hawaii, where I grew up, feared fire, the wrath of the goddess Pele, who expressed her displeasure by sending gallons of lava glugging across the land. But they didnt fear the sea in the same way, perhaps because to live on an isolated island in the Pacific is to never forget ones own insignificance, the utter temporality of life. That is why, to me, swimming will always mean swimming in the Pacific, in water that can only be described in extremes: the bluest, the saltiest, the wildest, the least predictable. There, water is a metaphor for life itself: something that should be approached with confidence, but with the knowledge that, finally, it is unconquerable and uncontrollable.Everyone who grows up in Hawaii knows this, and that knowledge was, I now think, one of the reasons that many of my high school classmates found The Swimmer, and Neddys dislocation within his own life, so perplexing. (There was also the matter of the storys anthropological curiosities: a community in which people always seemed to be drinking, a place dominated by pools, poor simulacra of the ocean. To us, the most upsetting aspect of Neddys life was that he had to live in Westchester at all.)What is this story about? asked our teacher, who had been raised in Providence and who had found himself, all these years later, on an island far from home, teaching teenagers who couldnt imagine that water could be gray or cold.Some guy whos getting old and doesnt know it, said one of my classmates, who surfed every morning and walked to school barefoot. And although I had rolled my eyes at her flippancy then, I have come to realize how right she was: Once you leave the water, you are reminded, as if punched, of the inexorability of your own decline.YOU CAN BE a good swimmer in two ways: You can either be very fast, or you can be very steady. Much the way you can immediately distinguish a ballet dancer (lithe, elegant) from a modern dancer (blocky, powerful), you can also immediately tell whos a speed swimmer and whos a distance swimmer. Speed swimmers look a bit like manta rays translated into bipedal form: long-torsoed, long-armed, short-legged. Distance swimmers are more seal-like: sleek, cobby, meaty. If you were a hungry shark on his daily glide, youd eat the distance swimmer first.I have a theory that many distance swimmers have parents who are scared of the water, who vowed that their children would find water something to luxuriate in, not avoid. My parents, who also grew up in Hawaii, are both frightened of the water. My father never learned to swim, not really; my mother learned to swim when her father rowed her and her three brothers out into the middle of the ocean in a small boat and threw them overboard.Throughout my life, swimming took on different meanings. First, it was something I did because my parents wanted me to: I joined my first team when I was 7, and was on one until I was 17. Then it was something I did because coaches wanted me to: I was broad-shouldered and strong and therefore a reliable butterflier, and swim teams are always in need of butterfliers, which is the most show-offy, the least efficient, of the four strokes. Then it was something I did because it was prescriptive: I had such severe asthma that I began missing months of school, and swimming was thought to strengthen the lungs; I was frequently on oral steroids to help me breathe, too much for a child, and swimming balanced the weight gain and anxiety, the constant hunger and jitteriness. And then, finally, it became something I did because it was pleasurable: because it was the one thing that made me feel physically graceful, because it was a way of both escaping my life and tunneling deeper into it. Now, water is the one place where I feel truly adrift from myself, and yet because there are so few good pools near where I live in New York City, I swim less and less.After Tisbury Great Pond, we drove to Edgartown Great Pond. Edgartown, on the far eastern side of the island, is what we think of when we think of Marthas Vineyard: not the island that was settled by the Wampanoag people a few thousand years ago and is still, in parts, woods and fields, crisscrossed with low, beautiful stone walls, each stone piled atop the last and bound with nothing, but the one of white clapboard houses in small yards planted with lilac and hydrangea bushes and bordered by white wooden fences. There is a primness, a cuteness, to the place, a simple if noxious prettiness. If you live on the western side of the island, as J. does, you rarely come to the eastern side, and as we drove through the end-of-summer traffic, looking for somewhere to eat, it was easy to forget we had just been stepping through dark waters, pointing out dead squid to each other.We ate lunch at an expensive cafe and then continued to Edgartown Great Pond, which is surrounded by depressingly large, unimaginative estates, all of them apparently unoccupied, their windows glinting flatly in the sun, and where I scuttled, in a crouch to avoid detection, through the tall sea grass to slip into the water. I swam to the other shore and then back before walking down the beach to meet J., who drove us to our final body of water, Katama, which is not really a pond at all, but an actual bay, where boats purred by and I could feel, for the first time, the expansiveness, the uncontainable hugeness, of the water I was in, the giddy sensation that if I didnt concentrate  and even if I did  I might lose my way entirely.But I knew I wouldnt. One of the best things about swimming is that you need no companion: The only thing better is knowing you have one anyway. When I was a few hundred yards out, I paused, and turned back toward the shore, where J. had stayed to wait for me. I waved at him, and he waved at me: I see you; do you see me? Later, wed drive back to his house above Menemsha, and hed cook and Id set the table, and then wed spend the night reading, and go to bed early: two middle-aged friends in a Cheever house who didnt have to live a Cheever life. It would be the perfect way to end the swim  in a world that remained as I had left it, with the things and people I love where they should be. Because of all the delights of swimming, the sweetest is the person who welcomes you back to land."}
{"text": "On two magazine covers the singer Zayn Malik has graced in the last few months  for Billboard and LUomo Vogue (as well as the racy video with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid)  he looks every bit the young brooding pop star. The requisite smoldering stare, perfectly manicured stubble and bad boy tattoos are all in tow.And then theres the hair.Mr. Malik, 23, a former member of the musical group One Direction, peers out in both images from beneath a silver mane. This isnt a case of a young man going prematurely gray, but a premeditated decision by the performer, who has a penchant for dyeing his hair and then broadcasting it to his 6.5 million Instagram followers.Gus Kenworthy, the Olympic freestyle skier who came out as gay last year on the cover of ESPN magazine, debuted an ashen dye job in December on his Instagram account, thanking Anderson Cooper, the CNN news anchor, for the inspiration, adding the hashtag #50shadesofgay.Theyre not alone.Gone are the days when guys would actively avoid graying hair. For a new generation of adventurous men, dyeing ones hair gray is gaining traction, appropriating a naturally occurring phenomenon from older men and giving it a millennial twist.Men are embracing color more in a general way, said Amie Rau, a stylist at Matthew Morris Salon in Denver, who dyed Mr. Kenworthys hair. This is an extension of that.Both Mr. Malik and Mr. Kenworthy declined to be interviewed for this article.Ms. Rau said that since their first session, Mr. Kenworthy had brought in an image of a young woman with dyed gray hair as inspiration. He kept asking me, Is it crazy that I want to do this?After the ESPN cover, 24-year-old Mr. Kenworthy went to Ms. Rau to go platinum blond. I said: You know, you just came out to an entire nation. You should do what you want to do, she recalled saying.Gray and silver hair has definitely been trending, said Aura Friedman, a senior hair colorist at Sally Hershberger Salon in New York. The demographic of guys who come to me to go gray are doing it more as a fashion statement, she said, as opposed to a more natural look. Ms. Friedman has dyed the hair of Phillip Picardi, the digital editorial director of Teen Vogue, and Drew Elliott, the chief creative officer for Paper magazine, among others.Interest definitely seems to be up. A representative from Amazon said it had seen a threefold increase in the last year in customers searching for gray hair dye.Its kind of an ironic statement, especially when the wearer is noticeably young and probably years away from natural graying, said Michael Fisher, creative director of men's wear at Fashion Snoops, the trend forecasting agency. Its just another bold way to stand out from the crowd.Tyler Oakley, 26, the social media personality who parlayed his online cachet into the documentary Snervous and book Binge last year, has experimented with his hair color, adopting many shades, from purple to green.Gray is the favorite color Ive ever had, he said. It was unique and fun, but its not eye catching in the way that like lilac or mint was. When I had those colors, I felt like everyone was looking at me. With gray, I felt like I was trying on a new look but it was also relatively natural.Celebrities arent the only ones to take the plunge. Ive always been confident, but now I feel more fun and cooler, Michael Vasquez, a 30-year-old senior business analyst, said of his artificial gunmetal hue, now several months old. I really love it. I feel sexier.Admittedly, part of that is because of the positive response he received from friends and on social media, getting 90 likes on his Instagram account. Of course, my mom doesnt like it, Mr. Vasquez said with a laugh.Achieving the silver fox look is an involved process. In the industry we call it a bleach and tone or a double process, Ms. Friedman said, referring to a two-part procedure in which the hair is first stripped of its natural pigment and then colored, an undertaking that can last eight hours and is often costly.While there is a range in prices depending on hair length and color, Ms. Friedman estimated that going gray would start at $350 at most salons. (She estimated a session for her services would be $600.) And that doesnt take into account upkeep. It does require a lot of maintenance, going back to the salon for touch-ups and conditioning it at home with the right products in between appointments, she said.The continued care also requires commitment, Ms. Rau said. Its like owning a pet, she said.However, because there are so many shades of gray  from those with bluish undertones to more natural variations  the color must be versatile enough to compliment a variety of skin tones.When youve got gray hair, every move you make seems young and spry, Andy Warhol said in his 1975 book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again) to explain his decision to dye his hair gray in his early 20s, a look that became his calling card. Its like youre getting a new talent.While there arent many precedents for young men co-opting the hoary coifs of their elders, trendsetting women like the fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, the pop star Grimes and Tilda Swinton have all embraced a faux gray. It has nothing to do with wanting to look old, said Mr. Fisher of Fashion Snoops. We are in the midst of a time when guys are breaking their own boundaries and really finding new ways to express themselves. Having gray hair plays right into that.Like Warhol, men of the Instagram era know that having a visual signature can be beneficial. It was never like part of some play for my brand, Mr. Oakley said. But as someone in a creative field, I thought, Well, why cant I do this?Thanks to endorsements from style-savvy celebrities and the growing popularity among the fashion cognoscenti, going gray is likely to hit a tipping point. Its crazy how many men have contacted me, Ms. Rau said of the response to Mr. Kenworthys gray unveiling on Instagram.Mr. Fisher, however, isnt so sure of its sustainability as a stylistic movement. Its just a fad, he said. Its just another part of personal expression like bleaching, mermaid hair and even man buns.Mr. Oakley had another reason for thinking the trend might not last: the upkeep. While he has thought about going gray again, nowadays, he said, Im too lazy for all that."}
{"text": "The Milanese mens wear brand Ermenegildo Zegna announced on Wednesday that it was parting ways with Stefano Pilati, the head of design for Ermenegildo Zegna Couture, confirming rumors that had been swirling since Monday and making it the third Italian mens house to lose its designer in a week. The departure was characterized as being by mutual agreement.Still, and perhaps more significantly, Mr. Pilati is the fourth designer in the past year to leave a job after only approximately three years. He follows in the footsteps of the New York designer Alexander Wang who agreed to disagree with Balenciaga last July; Raf Simons, who just said no to Dior in October; and Brendan Mullane, who consciously uncoupled from Brioni this week.You know the fashion rule: One is a fluke, two a coincidence, three a trend. So what does that make four? A new reality? Is a short stint at a big house the new black for a designer?Gildo Zegna, the chief executive of the Zegna Group, said in a statement, referring to Mr. Pilatis departure: We wanted to develop a strong point of view in fashion, and for Zegna to be a show not to missed in Milan. We have reached this objective faster than expected.Mr. Pilati also said that after long discussions with Mr. Zegna, We have reached the conclusion that the mission he entrusted me with has been fulfilled and he was ready to move on to other projects I had put aside in order to achieve our common goals with Zegna Couture.In other words: It was a project, and they finished it. And there is no question that Mr. Pilati, who made his name as creative director at Yves Saint Laurent, transformed Zegna into appointment fashion-week viewing. But it seems to me three years is far too short a time to really reboot a brands image and solidify a new direction in consumers minds and closets, even in the slow-moving, detail-oriented world of mens wear. Three years (effectively six collections) is more like a palate cleanser: a washing out of the old, and readying for the new.It is a truism in fashion that you are only as good as your last collection, which would suggest a new designer could come in and make a statement powerful enough for it to be all that matters (see: Phoebe Philos debut at Cline; Tom Fords at Gucci). But to really add up something, you need a body of last collections. And a three-year stint simply does not allow for that.Last month, The New York Times mens wear critic, Guy Trebay, wrote of what would turn out to be Mr. Pilatis final Zegna collection: Mr. Pilati drew an imaginary line with the collection between his wealthy potential consumer and vulgar Instagram hoi polloi. His clothes conveyed the quiet aura of money, chastely created and largely invisible.Will that be his legacy to the brand? Or will it just be a vague memory, as a new designer comes in to impose his or her vision, leading to a head-scratching moment for consumers to wonder if they are in the same house today as they were yesterday, and where, exactly, their loyalties lie?This is not an idle question for designers, who are fast becoming the fashion equivalent of basketball free agents, or the brands that employ them."}
{"text": "Shall we hate Russians? Or is hatred the lot of the weak? Yuri Biryukov, a Ukrainian activist and blogger, posed these questions on Facebook after recounting his feelings about bumping into ordinary Russians during a recent vacation.I just felt squeamish about seeing them, he wrote in a post that drew thousands of likes from Ukrainians and outraged many Russians. I had the feeling one has when looking at a pest the second before reaching for a shoe ...Yes, this is how popular discourse sounds these days. Even when they arent shooting at each other, Ukrainians and Russians exchange venomous comments on social networks.Meanwhile, despite the bile, the faint promise of a political settlement has reappeared at the turn of the year. Russia seems to be engaging more closely in the cease-fire process. President Vladimir Putin has appointed a new envoy to the contact group on Ukraine and has discussed the crisis with President Obama on the phone; talks behind closed doors were held between Victoria Nuland, a United States assistant secretary of state, and Vladislav Surkov, Mr. Putins aide on Abkhasia and South Ossetia and also, apparently, on Ukraine.Leonid Kuchma, a former president of Ukraine and his countrys envoy to the contact group, said recently that the negotiations needed to continue in the present format. He also suggested that he would welcome China getting involved in the process.Commentators may be debating whether these efforts reflect a new determination to reach a conclusive resolution, but experience suggests that even if Moscow does want a settlement, it only wants an interim one. The Kremlin clearly prefers the conflict to keep simmering because being able to turn the heat on and off (not just in Ukraine but in the Middle East too) is Russias only functioning foreign policy lever. But the price for constantly relying on this crude tool is Russian societys continued disassociation from its neighbors  Ukraine first and foremost.Ukrainian attitudes toward Russia have always encompassed a gamut of emotions, including an underlying resentment about a perceived sense of Russian superiority. In the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russians like me thought that this would fade away, helped by continuing linguistic and cultural links and a general opening up of civil society. We were wrong. Instead, in both societies, tense historical undercurrents have taken over.The attitude started to turn more than 10 years ago, during the elections of 2004 that became the Orange revolution, Mikhail Minakov, a Ukrainian philosopher and political scientist, wrote me in an e-mail. Hatred toward Russia, originally fostered by nationalists, caught on with the rest of Ukrainian society and became, with time, the only legitimate language in addressing Moscow. Russia became a legitimate enemy.A Ukrainian friend warned me before one of my recent trips to Ukraine, There are things you have to be cautious about, adding, try to avoid referring to Russians and Ukrainians as being one nation or one people or anything close.Even those Russians who are not supporters of Mr. Putin often deny their Ukrainian neighbors a separate identity and do not recognize Ukrainian otherness.The one people phrase has long been an irritant for many Ukrainians, in large part because Mr. Putin has used it so often. When Mr. Putin visited Kiev in 2013 to mark the 1,025th anniversary of the conversion to Christianity of the Kievan Rus  the Medieval kingdom that gave birth to both the common culture of Russia and Ukraine  he told the assembled masses: Wherever Ukraine may go, we still meet again sometime and somewhere. Why? Because we are one people.The Russian word he used, narod, was meant in Soviet and in Czarist times to represent the kinship of all the peoples and nationalities that comprised the Soviet Union and Imperial Russia. Today, the very word seems guaranteed to get under almost every patriotic Ukrainians skin.Mr. Putins politics of history may be working well for the Kremlin within Russia, but it puts the country on ground where no one else wants to stand. Many Russians continue to use official language rooted in the Soviet period. It is difficult for them  for us  to talk without stepping into an unfortunate turn of a phrase. We still, for example, refer to World War II as the Great Patriotic War. But for Ukraine it was something else  something to move away from.Russia and Ukraine have diverged in the way the identities of their respective societies work. Russians identify with the state, Ukrainians identify with a civil society. Among Ukrainians today, the best way to escape a totalitarian past is by developing a society that eclipses ethnic or state identities. This is beyond the ken of most Russians, who have trouble comprehending the idea of a society comprised of many competing elements  business, labor unions, independent political parties, courts, professional and civic groups. The Russian body politic equates society with the state. Ukraine, with its growing number of volunteer movements, nongovernment charities and independent political parties, is occupied in framing a new civic identity.Whatever the linguistic ties between Russia and Ukraine, the words we share no longer have the same meaning. The vocabulary of the state is fading. If the two countries are to forge a new understanding, we must negotiate using the language of civility, one that can be spoken in any tongue  be it Russian, Ukrainian, English or German  with far less danger of our words being lost in translation."}

In this tiny New England town, population 729, with its white steepled church and village green, Hunt and Allison Aldrich Smith, Democrats who support Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, live in a knotty pine house they built themselves.Mr. Smith, 71, makes violins in his wood-stove-heated studio here in the southwest corner of New Hampshire, crafting his instruments of spruce and maple just as they have been for centuries. We have very simple needs, said Ms. Smith, 56, a choir director who teaches traditional New England dances and revels in the towns artistic heritage.And yet, although she and her husband are comfortable, many other families were in crisis because they cannot afford to put food on the table, Ms. Smith said. She is also worried about the states heroin epidemic, which is ravaging families and taking hundreds of young lives.She supports Mr. Sanders, she said, because were here to help each other, and I like what he says about a more fair corporate tax structure.That mix of contentment and unease hints at the complex dynamics at play in New Hampshire this election season as the national spotlight swivels from the small, quirky state of Iowa to this even smaller, arguably quirkier state, which votes Tuesday.New Hampshire survived the Great Recession better than many states. Today it ranks at or near the top in several categories that measure a states health, like median household income, level of education and general well-being. Its rates of unemployment, crime and people living below the poverty line are among the lowest.Yet despite their relative prosperity and personal happiness, voters still express anxiety.Were better than average, economically speaking, said Bill Getty, 57, a mental health counselor, after hearing Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican running for president, speak in Exeter at the brick town hall. But not everything is milk and honey.Mr. Getty, too, pointed to the heroin epidemic. The state had an estimated 399 opioid overdose deaths in 2015, a 22 percent increase over the year before. In a survey last fall, 25 percent of voters said the heroin epidemic was the most important issue confronting the state, ahead of the economy. It is so overwhelming, Mr. Getty said. It dominates every conversation.Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire, said that voters mixed feelings reflected in part their generally positive views of their own lives and their more negative views of the country as a whole; 61 percent of New Hampshire voters say the state is headed in the right direction, but only 35 percent say the same about the country.The economy is not what it used to be, said Steve Hoffner, 42, a truck driver in Farmington, a blue-collar town in east-central New Hampshire. He and his wife, Faye, 47, who works in insurance administration, both strongly back Donald J. Trump in Tuesdays Republican primary.We arent angry, Ms. Hoffner said as they waited for Mr. Trump to appear in their high school gymnasium, which was festooned with a banner that read, Make America Great Again! We just dont want a career politician. The biggest concern for me is getting America back to where it was.Voters outlooks on the country are sharply divided along partisan lines. Polls show that 66 percent of New Hampshire Democrats believe the country is on the right track, but only 5 percent of Republicans agree. Much of the Republican dissatisfaction stems from disapproval of President Obama, his overhaul of the health care system and his support for gun control.Were on the edge of the precipice, said Nancy Kindler, 67, of Epping, echoing the words of Mr. Cruz, whom she supports. Her concerns include a fear that the country is becoming more socialistic, freedoms are being eroded and government is imposing too many regulations on people and businesses.Im worried sick for my children and grandchildren, she said.The two parties in New Hampshire also differ on which issues are most important. Since the terrorist attacks last fall in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Republicans have rated national security at the top, with 34 percent citing it as their priority; next are the economy at 26 percent and immigration at 11 percent.Among Democrats, 26 percent rate the economy as the top issue, while 13 percent say national security is.Some of the angst over the economy stems from a recognition that the states boom times are over.Even as major corporations like FedEx, UPS and Pratt & Whitney expand here, job growth over all has slowed and in some regions has yet to return to pre-recession levels. The cost of living can be relatively high, especially in the suburbs near the Massachusetts border. New Hampshires minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour, the lowest in New England; attempts to raise it have gone nowhere.Im more or less an angry voter, said Steve McEntire, 62, of New Durham, whose information technology job was outsourced to China and who now drives a coach bus between New Hampshire and Logan International Airport in Boston. He describes himself as a bus driver with an M.B.A. and supports Mr. Trump, whom he likes for bucking the establishment.I had a good career and saved for retirement, but I would hate to start over now, Mr. McEntire said. Ive got 10 grandchildren, and I can see them being financially strapped.Demographic shifts, meanwhile, are transforming the landscape.For one thing, the state is getting older. Its median age of 41.8 has surpassed Floridas (41.2), making it the third-oldest state by that measure. That has implications for health care costs, the state budget and the work force.At the same time, the state is losing young people. From 2000 to 2010, more than 10 percent of those 20 to 29 years old decamped.Liam Healy, 19, a forklift driver at Exels mammoth warehouse in Bow, is heading in the fall to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he will receive some financial aid. That will be less expensive than attending the University of New Hampshire, which has the highest in-state tuition of any public four-year school in the country, according to the College Board. The states rate of support for higher education is the nations lowest.I have to leave New Hampshire to do what I want to do, said Mr. Healy, who is supporting Mr. Sanders.The in-migration that helped expand the economy and kept New Hampshire growing faster than much of the Northeast has also slowed. The state still has a net gain of people 30 to 49 years old, but it is smaller than before the recession.Over all, the state has more turnover than most. Only 45 percent of New Hampshire residents were born here, compared with 68 percent nationwide who live in the state where they were born.More than 30 percent of those eligible to vote in Tuesdays primaries were either not here in 2008 or were too young to vote, according to a study from the University of New Hampshire. This makes assumptions about the electorate tricky.Its a completely different state than it was in 2008, Mr. Smith, the pollster, said."}
{"text": "We commonly assume that cancer afflicts the aging or aged, but approximately 16 percent of breast cancer deaths involve women under the age of 50.  How can or should an alarming death sentence be confronted in midlife?  The personal challenges posed by incurable disease unfold in an absorbing documentary about movie-making, A Woman Like Me, which opened in New York in October and became available on Netflix this January.The co-directors of A Woman Like Me, Alex Sichel and Elizabeth Giamatti, consider the roles played by temperament, spirituality and art as two vigorous women attempt to reconcile themselves to a terminal prognosis. The film portrays Ms. Sichel confronting metastatic breast cancer by making two movies.The first is a documentary of herself in the hospital with medical personnel and at home with her family.  Ms. Sichel, who received the diagnosis just before her daughter started kindergarten, is shown dealing with her ambivalence about the traditional therapies she undertakes.  Her parents, sisters and husband struggle on camera with their ambivalence about the holistic therapies she also undertakes.Braided with the documentary, the second movie Ms. Sichel makes is fictional: The actress Lili Taylor plays a buoyant alter ego, Anna, who must respond to the same dire diagnosis. The fictional narrative of A Woman Like Me centers on a happier version of Alex Sichel so she can watch someone stepping lightly through her fraught terrain.For example, Anna sits with a friend in a restaurant and interrogates the waitress.  Is there dairy in the vegetarian dish? Are there gluten-free options?  Her friend orders the cavatelli, Anna steamed kale without salt.  After a pause, though, she changes her mind; she will have the cavatelli as well as a glass of Cabernet.  In the near future, she says, she does not want to look back on pointless good behavior.In contrast, Ms. Sichel presents herself in a series of tortured conversations with a variety of advisers as she hurtles between fear and hope on an emotional roller coaster. She visits a meditation center and consults a Buddhist teacher, but equanimity often eludes her.  Intermittently sad and angry, yet terrified of dying angry, she tries to find serene memories, only to recall her sorrow at her grandmothers death, whereas Anna remembers her grandmothers cooking.A Woman Like Me hints that some people may be endowed with a disposition that facilitates their making peace with their imminent demise, although maybe those people exist only in fiction.  Yet both stormy Alex and sunny Anna try to learn how to acknowledge their looming mortality.  In especially poignant scenes, Alex and Anna must come to terms with their grief at losing their young children and also with their childrens future grief at losing them.Anna copes with cancer most dramatically when she rehearses her death with her husband.  Enlisting his help, she promises to refrain from moaning, but wants to know what his final words to her will be.  And then she encourages him to drape a white sheet over her head.  Annas directing the scene with her husband tells us something about Alex Sichels decision to spend the last year of her life co-directing a movie.Like Annas rehearsing, Ms. Sichels movie-making is a testament to creativity and to the multiplicity of the self.  Ms. Sichel refutes what cancer will inevitably make of her by imagining what she makes of it.  In A Woman Like Me, she offers a defense of cancer art as a way of envisioning and practicing mortality.  Throughout the film she espouses the efficacy of Buddhism, but the creator of Anna provides us proof of the value of story-telling.If Alex Sichel could not become a sunnier person, she could envision herself being one. Through this endeavor, she and her co-director, Ms. Giamatti, illuminate what it means to live with incurable cancer not, as Ms. Giamatti put it during a phone conversation, in a Halcion or Hollywood manner, but in all its messy and contradictory intensity.After watching the movie, I was upset at learning that Ms. Sichel died on June 23, 2014, at the age of 50, and then I was surprised at my distress since the end of the film makes it abundantly clear that she was suffering advanced disease.  Yet somehow I could not believe that this engaged and engaging woman was dead. My reaction also testifies to the power of art, for Alex Sichel and her double Anna continue to touch and instruct people like me by showing us characters like ourselves.If we cannot attain complete and lasting tranquility in the face of a death sentence, we can nevertheless conceive of a series of precarious, provisional moments of acceptance.  Story-telling serves not as an escape from the reality of disease but as an assertion of the self against what will eventually happen.Terrible as cancer is, it has prompted people to produce astonishing art. The power of this meta-movie resides not in retrospective platitudes about women with metastatic disease but in its representations of their urgent exertions to imagine the unimaginable.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "When Hannah (Rebecca Hall) is introduced in Tumbledown, roaming her rustic Maine cabin and working at a typewriter next to her two dogs, you half expect the scene to turn into a coffee commercial (maybe right after the canine reaction shot). The dawdling city-country dramedy that follows could have used the caffeine for its slack story of love after grief.The tale, directed by Sean Mewshaw and written by Desi Van Til, pairs an ambivalent Ms. Hall with a diffident Jason Sudeikis. Ms. Halls Hannah is hung up on her dead husband, a revered indie-folk singer named Hunter Miles. Mr. Sudeikis plays Andrew, a pop-culture academic who visits Hannah while researching a biography of Hunter. Andrew is supposed to be one of those real New York types, with a secret decency. Hannah, a native to the area, is willowy, wary and protective of Hunters catalog of echoic ballads (courtesy of Damien Jurado).Were meant to warm to Hannah and Andrew as they wear each other down with good-natured ribbing. But Ms. Hall and Mr. Sudeikis hardly warm up themselves, showing little chemistry and looking unsure how to play the films tone, or the would-be zingers. Their setting is patched together through bits of business with a couple of local townsfolk, and a mini Thanksgiving-homecoming drama when the pair visit Hannahs family.One of the sillier parts of the stale screenplay is Andrews cool music-biz girlfriend (Dianna Agron). She turns up in Maine to remind us that Hannah and Andrew are on the cusp of romance, in the likely event wed missed it. NICOLAS RAPOLDTumbledown is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for a sex scene."}
{"text": "The actor Matt LeBlanc will join the cast of the BBCs car-themed show Top Gear, a popular program known for its on-air antics  as well as its high-profile staffing changes.Top Gear said on Thursday that Mr. LeBlanc, who played Joey on the sitcom Friends and is a self-described car nut, would join the shows host, Chris Evans, a British presenter whose hiring was announced last summer.Matts a lifelong fellow petrolhead, and Im thrilled hes joining Top Gear, Mr. Evans said in a statement. Acting out our craziest car notions on screen is a dream job and I know well both be debating some epic road trip ideas.Mr. LeBlanc, who will be the first American to co-host the program, is no stranger to Top Gear, especially its segment Star in a Reasonably Priced Car. During an appearance, he zipped around a racetrack in a Kia Ceed, earning the segments fastest time for that model (though the actor Rowan Atkinson came close).Just dont use the brake as much, thats all, Mr. LeBlanc said while behind the wheel.Even with Mr. LeBlancs automotive chops, the previous cast could be a tough act to follow. After the BBC restarted Top Gear in 2002, the cars tended to take a back seat to the antics of its three hosts, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, as they traipsed the globe.Controversy occasionally followed: Mr. Clarkson was suspended last March after he attacked a producer after a night of drinking. The contract for Mr. Clarkson, once among the BBCs highest-earning employees, was not renewed. In July, Amazon announced that Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Hammond would join the company to film a new show.The BBC has said that more cast members will join Mr. LeBlanc and Mr. Evans. According to The Guardian, two possibilities are Sabine Schmitz, a German racing driver, and Chris Harris, a British journalist."}
{"text": "DETROIT   With American consumers buying new vehicles in record numbers, General Motors is raking in big profits and promising even better earnings in 2016. G.M., the nations largest automaker, said on Wednesday that it earned a profit of $9.7 billion in 2015 primarily because of its strong performance in its core North American market.The results were bolstered by special items, including changes in valuations for certain assets, which added $1.5 billion to its net income.The valuation adjustments helped G.M. overcome other charges it took last year to settle a Justice Department investigation into defective ignition switches tied to at least 124 deaths and to compensate victims of accidents in the affected vehicles.G.M. said its performance was a company record and represented a marked improvement over its net income of $2.8 billion in 2014.Despite concerns among investors that vehicle sales in the United States may have peaked, G.M. executives expressed confidence that the industry will surpass the 17.5 million cars and trucks sold last year.We believe the fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry, Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday.Ms. Barra said G.M.s strong earnings would help it add models and invest in electric vehicles and other new technology.She emphasized that G.M. was behaving more like a technology company than a traditional automaker by investing in ride-sharing services and autonomous vehicles.Like other major carmakers, G.M. is trying to keep pace with technology companies like Google that are developing driverless cars.We know our industry is being disrupted, Ms. Barra said. And we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and global resources to lead that disruption.Still, investors have not rewarded G.M.s accomplishments with a higher stock price. The companys shares closed Wednesday at $28.92, which is considerably lower than its 52-week high of $38 achieved last spring.Analysts are giving much of the credit for G.M.s performance to the economic conditions supporting the soaring market for new vehicles.G.M.s strong 2015 fourth quarter and full-year performances certainly reflect the current health of the U.S. auto sector that is benefiting from low gas prices, ready availability of credit and a favorable pricing environment, said Bruce Clark, senior vice president of Moodys Investors Service.He said G.M. was doing a good job of controlling costs, managing production in line with retail demand and keeping its new product pipeline fresh.For the year, G.M. reported revenues of $152.4 billion, compared with $155.9 billion in 2014. It said the change was mostly related to the negative impact of currency exchange rates in some markets.The company said results in North America were the driving force behind its record performance.G.M. said it earned a pretax profit of $11 billion in the region in 2015. Under the terms of the contract it signed last year with the United Automobile Workers, the results translate into profit-sharing checks of as much as $11,000 for each of its 49,000 hourly employees.The automaker had varied results in other global regions, reporting pretax losses of about $800 million in Europe and $600 million in South America, and a pretax profit of $1.4 billion in its international division that includes China.For the fourth quarter of last year, G.M. said it earned net income of $6.3 billion, which represented a significant gain over the $1.1 billion it earned in the fourth quarter a year earlier.The company posted revenue of $39.6 billion in the fourth quarter, which was about the same as the previous year."}
{"text": "If you missed Taraji P. Henson on the cover of the February issue of Elle, dont despair. You can sift through the stacks at the nail salon and find her on the cover of Allure, from last July. Or on the August cover of W. Or Glamour (October). Or Essence (November).Ms. Henson, the actress behind the saucy, animal-print-loving, ex-con, mama-bear, hip-hop manager and muse Cookie Lyon on Empire, is not just the breakout star of the hit Fox network soap opera but also the current queen of the fashion magazine.As even casual readers and newsstand passers-by know, certain actresses, for a few months or many, can become fashion-magazine darlings. Over the years, there has been Sarah Jessica Parker, Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, to name a few. (And before actresses took over, models like Cindy Crawford, Niki Taylor and Carol Alt reigned.)Another familiar face in 2015 was Reese Witherspoon, with two covers of Glamour alone. And she is starting 2016 strong, on the February issue of Harpers Bazaar.Ms. Henson and Ms. Witherspoon represent what have become default options for mainstream fashion magazines, whose covers were once opportunities to surprise, as with Diana Vreelands 1959 Bazaar cover showing a collage of gloves or Anna Wintours debut cover for Vogue in 1988, with the belly-baring Israeli model Michaela Bercu.Now, readers can generally rely on seeing one of two possibilities: the new star or the beloved standby. The standby becomes a readers best friend, said Joanna Coles, editor in chief of Cosmopolitan (whose March cover will feature Jessica Alba, seen last fall on the covers of Self and Allure). Editors hope that they will be able to revisit the same celebrities as cover models as they get married, have children, overcome heartbreak or have career breakthroughs like Ms. Witherspoon.Reese is a tremendous example of someone with star power evolving into a producer, Ms. Coles said. Readers are invested in relationships with these women, and we want to see how they grow. (Cosmos best-selling cover of last year was the one with Cameron Diaz, who used to model and has also produced and written a health guide for women, The Body Book.)Magazines also want to claim freshly minted celebrities, Ms. Coles said. Taraji is in an incredibly hot show, and everybody wants a bit of that for their reader, she said.Even as the newsstand sales of magazines continue to diminish as a significant source of revenue, that part of the business matters a lot, said Cyndi Stivers, a veteran magazine editor who now consults for media brands, because newsstand sales are by far more profitable than subscriptions. Its critical to think who is going to give you a bump if you possibly can get one, she said, and once editors hit one that works, they tend to go back to the well as much as possible until its dry.Many editors would love to take a risk on an up-and-comer. But since print magazines sit around for weeks, while the fashion and celebrity websites that are competing with them for views can quickly replace underperforming content, the stakes are high. There is risk aversion, and it is understandable, said Janice Min, the president and chief creative officer of the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, whose flagship publications are reliant on subscriptions and digital consumers. Winning that game still is important, you want to have someone relevant.Ms. Min, who knows the highs and lows of newsstand sales thanks to her former stewardship of Us Weekly, added, one bad sale can have a big impact on your brand. I feel for everyone who has to make these decisions.Fashion magazines are often hampered by editors who are booking celebrities for cover shoots sometimes six months before the magazines are to appear on newsstands. With the long lead time, the gamble the magazines are taking is on those who have clean lives and wont do anything stupid, said Steven Cohn, editor in chief of the Media Industry Newsletter. These are safe and familiar faces.But though arguably less interesting for readers, this imprimatur of popular acceptability remains an important career marker for subjects, Ms. Coles said. They get tired of being in a slide show list of 20 other celebrities who wore a red dress, she said. Its a very special moment for a star, especially a young star. Its something of a crowning."}
{"text": "Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont clashed in heated terms over the meaning of progressivism in America on Wednesday, with her forced to defend positions that he argued are not in line with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.Mr. Sanders criticized Mrs. Clintons credentials as a progressive, claiming that her views on foreign policy, trade, the environment and money in politics separated her from those lawmakers who proudly wear that label.At a town hall forum hosted by CNN less than a week before New Hampshire holds the first primary election of the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Sanders suggested that Mrs. Clintons positions sometimes shifted depending on her venue.You cant say youre a moderate on one day and be a progressive on another day, he said, noting that Mrs. Clinton described herself as a moderate last year. You cant be a moderate and a progressive. Theyre different.Minutes after Mr. Sanders spoke, Mrs. Clinton pushed back at his assertion, saying that by his definition, President Obama or Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would not be considered progressives.I am a progressive who likes to get things done, she said. I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up as the gatekeeper of who gets to be a progressive.Mrs. Clinton went on to say that it was inappropriate for the senator to be defining such labels so rigidly.I know where I stand, I know who stands with me, I know what Ive done, she said.The forum was the first direct encounter between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders since she stopped him in the Iowa caucuses by the narrowest of margins.Though she ultimately prevailed in Iowa, the victory offered little satisfaction. Mr. Sanders raised questions about problems at caucus precincts and some votes that were decided by a coin toss. What was supposed to be a night that propelled Mrs. Clinton to the nomination turned out to be a sigh of relief.With both candidates trying to seize momentum from a nominating contest that proved barely decisive, the stakes in New Hampshire have grown. Mr. Sanders needs a victory in this, his neighboring state; Mrs. Clinton could use an upset or at least a strong showing.The argument that has boiled over ahead of the town hall forum was over which of the two could claim the true mantle of liberal values. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders accused Mrs. Clinton of being a part-time progressive and a patron of Wall Street.I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15 million from Wall Street; thats just not progressive, he said.He added: The key foreign decision of modern American history was the war in Iraq. The progressive community was pretty united in saying, Dont listen to Bush, dont go to war. Secretary Clinton voted to go to war.Earlier in the day, at a town hall meeting in Derry, N.H., Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, hit back at suggestions that she was not a progressive.It was kind of a low blow, Mrs. Clinton said, listing highlights of her rsum that included standing up for gay and womens rights around the world.It was a good day for progressives when I helped get eight million kids health care, she said. I think it was a good day for progressives when I joined with colleagues in the Senate to help stop George W. Bush from privatizing Social Security. I think it was a good day for progressives when I went to Geneva and Beijing to stand up for gay rights and womens rights.Mr. Sanders has been holding double-digit leads in most New Hampshire polls. Mrs. Clinton considered directing her resources to other states, but after the close call in Iowa she decided to take a serious run at New Hampshire in hopes of pulling off another upset in a place where voters helped her disprove polling data and surprise then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008.Under pressure from Mr. Sanders to demonstrate that she is a progressive, she detailed in explicit terms the fights that she has faced with Republicans over the years, painting herself as the candidate most battle-tested to promote Democrats causes.They want to control our country, she said of Republican special interest groups. They want to destroy our balance of power  they want to go after our political system and fill it with people that will do their bidding.As she did in 2008 in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton also opened up in personal terms. This time it was about her religion and the meaning of spirituality in her life.She also shared revealing anecdotes, recounting how as first lady she would sneak out of the White House in disguise and, with the Secret Service, wander around the National Mall and help tourists take photos.Still, as she discussed faith and railed against the influence of money in politics, Mrs. Clinton struggled to justify the money she takes from wealthy donors who finance her campaign or why she thought it was ethical to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars to give speeches to firms like Goldman Sachs before she decided to run for president.Pressed on the matter by Anderson Cooper, the forums moderator, Mrs. Clinton said that had not decided to run for president when she was accepting such large sums of money.Asked if it was appropriate to take $675,000 for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton stepped backward and said: Well, I dont know. Thats what they offered."}
{"text": "Almost everyone with a bank account has encountered this situation: You return home after shopping, or dining out, and discover that your debit card is missing.Frantic phone calls to stores and restaurants ensue, as you mentally retrace your steps to determine where you may have left the little plastic card.More banks are now offering a simple tool to protect bank accounts quickly, while the customer figures out where the card might be and retrieves it  or decides its lost and requests a new one. It is known as a debit card lock, or on/off switch, and it requires just a few taps or swipes on a mobile phone.This week, Bank of America became one of the first big national banks to offer the feature to its debit card customers who use online or mobile banking.Its addressing customers concerns, said Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at the bank. She noted that in contrast to credit cards, debit cards are linked directly to accounts holding customers cash.The lock technology has been available for several years. Malauzai Software, which makes apps for financial institutions, says about half of its 350 community bank and credit union clients offer the feature to their customers. Other card issuers offering versions of the feature include USAA, which has offered it since 2012, and Capital One.Banks are offering the feature not only to give customers peace of mind but also to reduce the cost of issuing new cards, said Al Pascual, director of fraud and security at Javelin Strategy and Research.In 2014, a year when many retail data breaches made consumers nervous about the security of their credit and debit cards, nine out of 10 people affected by a data breach received at least one new card. The cost was tremendous for banks, Mr. Pascual said.Ms. Moore said fewer than 20 percent of Bank of Americas debit card holders call to have a card reissued because it was left behind somewhere. But that is still a large number, she said, because the bank has more than 30 million debit card holders.Here is how Bank of Americas version of the debit card lock works (other banks features are similar): Users log onto their accounts on a phone or other device (the mobile app must already have been downloaded), and select Manage debit card settings under the help menu.An image of the debit card appears, and the user swipes an on/off switch to lock the card. The app asks, Are you sure? and the customer taps a confirmation screen to lock the card.Once the card is locked, it cannot be used to make purchases or withdraw money from automatic teller machines until the user unlocks it. Other types of transactions, like automatic deposits and bill payments, are not affected, Ms. Moore said.Other big banks, like Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo, do not yet offer the debit card lock feature. A Citi spokesman said customers do have the option of locking their debit cards at any time by calling the bank (they can call again to have them unlocked). A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the banks customers could opt to receive text messages when the bank notices suspicious transactions.While the original idea was that consumers would use the debit lock occasionally, in case of a misplaced card, Robb Gaynor, co-founder and chief product officer at Malauzai Software, said many users choose to leave their cards turned off as a default setting and unlock them when they use them.Theyre using it to prevent fraud, he said. They turn it off. Then, when they check out at Piggly Wiggly, they turn it on.Initially, there was some concern that a consumer who turned off a card and forgot to turn it back on might be frustrated. But the card can be turned on quickly via mobile phone, so that has not been a problem, Mr. Gaynor said.Here are some questions and answers about card security features: What if I have a joint account with another family member?The lock is card-specific. If one card is locked, the others linked to the account will still work  unless the user turns those off as well. How long does it take to lock and unlock the card?The feature is intended to work within seconds. In an informal test, a reporter locked a Bank of America debit card using a mobile phone; the card was then rejected by an A.T.M. (The machine spit out the card and displayed a message stating, This card is not valid.) Then, moments later, while at the A.T.M., the user unlocked the card using the mobile phone. The machine immediately accepted the card and dispensed cash. Are lock switches available on credit cards?Some credit cards, including the Discover card and credit cards issued by USAA, offer similar lock features."}
{"text": "Americas biggest pork producer and a major agricultural commodities trader have been among Chinas prized acquisitions in recent years.Now, the state-owned China National Chemical Corporation, known as ChemChina, has clinched a deal to buy Syngenta, a giant in farm chemicals and seeds, for $43 billion, underscoring Chinas desire to secure a sustainable food supply for its population of 1.4 billion people.As in deals for energy and other natural resources, Chinese companies have shown themselves willing to put up increasingly larger sums of money to acquire foreign agricultural counterparts  and expertise.The background here is that China is very sensitive to dependency on foreign food, said Derek M. Scissors, an economic policy fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who studies Chinese overseas investment.Government regulators in China have struggled to control and maintain the nations food supply chain in recent years. Food safety scandals  for example, when dairy producers sold milk formula laced with melamine, putting 300,000 babies in the hospital and killing six  have produced embarrassing headlines for Beijing. At the same time, as the average income of Chinese families has risen, their taste preferences have changed.How to meet this growing demand has been a priority for many in Chinas food production industry.Three years ago, the president of the state-owned foodstuffs conglomerate Cofco Corporation  which bought the agriculture division of the commodities trader Noble Group of Hong Kong  was at a conference in Beijing showing participants two sets of PowerPoint slides.One slide revealed that 30 million Chinese were eating Western-style foods at the time. Another slide estimated that by 2018, 300 million Chinese would be consuming Western foods, according to Alan C. Middleton, an assistant professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto, who attended the conference and recounted a conversation with Yu Shubo, Cofcos president.China produces nearly one-third less wheat, corn or other grains per hectare (2.47 acres) than the United States, according to United Nations data. A smaller portion of its land is arable because of overcrowding, pollution and a harsh environment in the countrys western region.Even within its farmland, China, with its legacy of industrialization, fast growth and lax regulatory enforcement, has struggled: In 2014, the authorities said nearly one-fifth of its arable land was polluted.Those factors have spurred China to rely increasingly on imports, stoking concern among some officials in Beijing about dependence on foreign supplies of food.Still, the timing of the deal was in ChemChinas favor. Six months ago, Syngenta said no to a $47 billion takeover attempt from Monsanto, arguing it was too risky. But things have changed significantly. Commodities prices have slumped, decreasing the chances of a big payday for Syngenta.When ChemChina offered to buy Syngenta  but leave Syngentas Swiss headquarters and management in place  the answer was an enthusiastic yes.Under terms of the deal, ChemChina will pay $465 a share and a special dividend of five Swiss francs, or about $4.90, upon closing. That would be the equivalent of 480 francs a share, representing a 22 percent premium to Syngentas closing price on Tuesday.But the deal is not just about Chinas demand for food security. It is also part of a bigger trend of Chinese companies, often with government encouragement, seeking to take a seat at the table with global corporate chieftains.ChemChina is yet another in a long line of Chinese companies which say: We want to be a global player, said Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, an Asia-focused asset manager in the United States.Syngenta will remain mostly independent and continue to be run by its existing management, according to terms of the deal, which requires at least two-thirds of Syngentas shareholders to agree to sell their stock to ChemChina.The easiest way to say it is that Syngenta will remain Syngenta, Michel Demar, Syngentas chairman, said in a video on the companys website.The deal also comes as Beijing grapples with its long-held resistance to genetically modified crops. China does not generally allow the growth of genetically modified crops for human consumption, though its farmers and processors use them for oils and animal feed. Genetically modified crops face widespread public skepticism in a country where food quality is a constant fear.Chinese leaders have nonetheless taken steps to nurture a homegrown genetically modified crop industry. Two years ago, China also began to make public efforts to ease that skepticism  a function of a time when it may need G.M.O. crops to feed its growing population.The country has also been seeking resources deals, and consistently tops the rankings when it comes to buying companies in commodities and agribusiness.For its part, ChemChina has been active buying up other companies. It has engaged in more than a half-dozen acquisitions of companies in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.It recently took a minority stake in Mercuria, a Swiss energy and commodities company, in a move to diversify its portfolio and expand into the energy sector.Last year, ChemChina bought Pirelli, the Italian tire maker, for 7.1 billion euros, or about $7.7 billion. And just last month it sealed a deal for KraussMaffei, a German manufacturer of plastic- and rubber-processing machinery, for about $1 billion.The discussions between our two companies have been friendly, constructive and cooperative, and we are delighted that this collaboration has led to the agreement announced today, Ren Jianxin, ChemChinas chairman, said of Wednesdays deal. We will continue to work alongside the management and employees of Syngenta to maintain the companys leading competitive edge in the global agricultural technology field.Syngenta, based in Basel, Switzerland, is one of the worlds largest producers of agricultural chemicals, including insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and seeds. The company reported sales of $13.4 billion in 2015 and employs more than 28,000 people in over 90 countries.It was created in November 2000 by the merger of the agribusinesses of Novartis and AstraZeneca.The ChemChina deal is likely to face significant regulatory scrutiny, particularly in Europe and the United States. Some observers expressed skepticism that it would take place at all.Under the plan, four of Syngentas existing directors would be part of its new 10-member board, and ChemChina said it would seek to publicly list a minority stake in Syngenta down the road.The question remains whether regulators will block the deal, particularly in the United States. North America accounted for about 27 percent of Syngentas sales in 2015.Because of Syngentas presence in America, the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, a government panel that reviews takeovers by foreign buyers, will probably take a close look at the transaction.The committee raised unforeseen concerns in October about a similar deal in which Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, would sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED components business to GO Scale Capital, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners.ChemChina and Syngenta are highly complementary businesses with relatively limited overlaps in products, Mr. Ren, the ChemChina chairman, said in a video. We will work closely with all of the regulatory agencies involved, and we are confident that we will receive regulatory approval."}
{"text": "The members of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah have not spent 40 years in the real estate wilderness of New York City.That would have been easy.Instead, it has taken the congregation 43 years to be able to build a synagogue designed for its needs, in a property that it owns. Money has not been the only obstacle. In the 1980s and 1990s, Beit Simchat Torah was struggling for its very existence, as one member after another succumbed to AIDS.Now, construction workers are completing the congregations first permanent home, 130 West 30th Street, in what was once the fur district of Midtown Manhattan.Far from hiding its identity as a synagogue for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Jews, Beit Simchat Torah will greet its new neighbors with a facade almost entirely of glass.The congregation has transformed two storefront spaces in an 18-story, 88-year-old landmark loft building, designed with striking Assyrian motifs by the architect Cass Gilbert, which is now a condominium apartment tower called the Cass Gilbert. The spaces came with enormous plate-glass windows, which Beit Simchat Torah kept as part of the redesign, by Architecture Research Office.We gay Jews, who were rejected by traditional Judaism, open our doors to everyone, said William J. Hibsher, a lawyer who has headed the congregations $23 million capital development project for more than 15 years.The congregation is not unmindful of the security challenge imposed on any Jewish institution these days. But it will have several important things working to its advantage.The windows are embassy grade, said Aari Ludvigsen, the vice president of the congregations board and the project manager for the new synagogue. That means the glass is laminated with a polymer film designed to hold it in place in case of a blast.And the building is next door to the Police Departments Traffic Operations District, a fortresslike former precinct house, meaning that police officers are on the block day and night. In place of bollards, we have police cars, Ms. Ludvigsen said.It is not with a shudder, then, but with a joyful noise  furnished by a klezmer band  that the congregations members plan to walk to their new home on April 3 from the current synagogue, deep within the Westbeth complex at 57 Bethune Street, out of sight from the street. The new synagogue will be dedicated on that day, after the congregations five Torah scrolls arrive and are installed in the ark.The ark is framed by the most unusual architectural feature in the 299-seat sanctuary: a 46-by-17-foot wall, inclined 10 degrees away from the congregation and topped by a skylight, as if a transom had been cracked open.The panels that form the wall were cast in glass-fiber-reinforced concrete with vertical divisions, or mullions, in a seemingly random pattern. The effect is almost like a silvery, frozen version of the waterfalls in the pools of the National September 11 Memorial. It also calls to mind the Civic Center Synagogue in Lower Manhattan and the M.I.T. Chapel in Cambridge, Mass.Though it may not photograph dramatically, the wall has a mystical quality when seen in person. You cant tell whats shadow and whats object, Stephen Cassell, a principal of Architecture Research Office, said. Its irregular pattern is designed to disperse sound through the room. Music is an important part of congregation life, he explained.At the back of the sanctuary will be a memorial wall of floor-to-ceiling gray glass, sandwiching an array of 606 LEDs. Each can be programmed to shine on the anniversary of the death of the person whose name is etched in front of the light. Memorial lights commemorating those who died in the Holocaust and the AIDS epidemic will always shine.Between 95 and 140 members died from AIDS, Ms. Ludvigsen said. The exact number may never be known, because the cause of death was frequently unspoken by survivors, especially during the epidemics early days in the 1980s.We are still seeing new infections, Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum, the senior rabbi of the congregation, said on Tuesday. We lost a very significant cohort of those men who would have been members. I feel their loss every day.Beit Simchat Torah is no different than traditional synagogues in providing classrooms for its members children. But it does differ in having been built with a large, gender-neutral restroom. There are common sinks but seven private toilet stalls, each with a solid wooden door and its own mirror (for those who would rather do their primping out of public view).Constructing a single restroom required a variance from the Buildings Department, which would otherwise have called for the installation of two restrooms; one for women, one for men.In the congregations application, Rabbi Kleinbaum told city officials, This is a deeply Jewish act, to build shalom bayit, a peaceful, safe and inclusive home for all who come through our doors, and reflect the value of btzelem elohim, that we, as Jews of all genders, are made in the image of G-d.The variance was granted."}
{"text": "The Fiction Issue(self-released)Gabriel Kahane poses a timeless rhetorical question in The Fiction Issue, his finely wrought new album: Whats a day without a doughnut? Hes singing in the guise of someone headed out for coffee, bathed in bright morning light. But the darkening shivers of his arrangement for string quartet, played by Brooklyn Rider, set up an emotional pivot: Hes still numb from a wrenching loss, and his daily routine provides only meager distraction.Mr. Kahane is deeply in his element here, sketching vignettes with ruminative grace. He wrote The Fiction Issue, the six-part song cycle at the heart of his album, as a Carnegie Hall commission for voices and strings. Shara Worden (who records as My Brightest Diamond) is the other vocalist, her chamber operatic soprano offset by Mr. Kahanes conversational baritone, singing a series of art songs that can just as readily evoke Robert Schumann as Paul Simon.That sophisticated breadth of style is a trademark for Mr. Kahane. Bradbury, from his 2014 album, The Ambassador (Sony Masterworks), serves as a springboard here for Bradbury Studies, a string interlude featuring a range of new-music techniques. (Brooklyn Rider will revisit the piece when it performs with Mr. Kahane on Sunday at National Sawdust.)The Fiction Issue isnt the only song cycle on the album: Mr. Kahane also includes a three-part invention called Come On All You Ghosts, adapted from Matthew Zapruders 2010 poetry collection. The second movement, Letter to a Lover, progresses in bittersweet drifts, as if each line of verse had dictated its own musical angle of approach.But the albums title suite is the more momentous. Though the lyrics are shrewdly ambiguous, its a post-Sept. 11 piece of art, concerned with the ways a society carries on after collective tragedy. O falling body, Ms. Worden sings at several points; there are stories of recovery, references to the accident, a more concrete image of buildings crashing.Strikingly, Mr. Kahane employs the strings as a partner in his narrative drive, often letting Brooklyn Rider punctuate or answer an emotional theme. It happens for the last time when Ms. Worden speaks for an entire city: Well be fine, she sings, but the melody doesnt resolve."}
{"text": "GENEVA   The United Nations on Wednesday temporarily suspended the fledgling talks aimed at ending the war in Syria and called on the countries fueling the conflict to do more to yield results, as Syrian government forces sharply escalated an offensive on a strategic rebel-held city.I have concluded, frankly, that after the first week of preparatory talks there is more work to be done, not only by us but by the stakeholders, the United Nations mediator, Staffan de Mistura, said after meeting with the opposition delegation on Wednesday evening at a Geneva hotel that serves as its headquarters.Mr. de Mistura took pains to add that the pause did not mean the end or the failure of the talks. In a statement later in the evening, he suggested that the governments failure to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Syria by allowing food and medicine into rebel-held towns had prevented any serious discussions.Im not prepared to have talks for the sake of talks, he said, adding that they would resume no later than Feb. 25.The pause is sure to loom over a donor conference that starts on Thursday in London, where the worlds rich countries are to discuss raising money to feed and house Syrians scattered around the world.Last year, donors gave barely half of what was needed; rations were cut for Syrians living in neighboring Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey; and hundreds of thousands of Syrians fled across the Mediterranean to Europe.In announcing a recess in Geneva, Mr. de Mistura essentially kicked the ball over to the countries that are backing each side on the battlefield. Foreign ministers from the United States and Russia, along with the regional powers that support the government and opposition sides, are to meet again next Thursday in Germany.The recess comes as Russian airstrikes have helped Syrian forces make major advances in the conflict and made them far less likely, diplomats say, to enter into serious negotiations. At the same time, the rebels and their backers in Saudi Arabia and Turkey are hard-pressed to negotiate a political deal, or even a truce, without a guarantee that their chief nemesis, President Bashar al-Assad, will be ousted.In a statement issued Wednesday from London, where he was to attend the donor conference, Secretary of State John Kerry called on the Assad government to cease the bombing of rebel forces. He said it was past time for them to meet existing obligations and restore the international communitys confidence in their intentions of supporting a peaceful resolution.The talks in Geneva had barely begun, with Mr. de Mistura meeting a government delegation last Friday and continuing meetings with the main opposition delegation on Monday and Wednesday. The gulf between the two sides remains so wide that they were never meant to meet face to face.There was discord over who would represent the opposition and what would be discussed, and by the time both parties arrived in Geneva, the goals were ratcheted down. The opposition delegation insisted that no political negotiations could begin until sieges had been lifted on rebel-held towns, airstrikes halted and political prisoners released.Yet the suspension of the talks made it clear that even those modest goals were not to be met anytime soon.The opposition bloc, known as the High Negotiating Committee and backed by Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that it would not return to Geneva until it sees progress on the ground.In a news conference, the committees leader, Riad Hijab, blamed the government for the suspension. The regime is trying to buy time without doing anything, Mr. Hijab said. He stopped short of saying the talks had failed, adding that he hoped the world powers would use the pause to lean on Mr. Assad.Mr. Hijab accused Russia of repeatedly bombing Aleppo, an ancient city on the Turkish border, and accused the Syrian government of using cluster bombs and barrels that explode in midair and hit civilians indiscriminately.In a news conference across town, Bashar al-Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations and the governments chief negotiator, said the talks had not gone further because of preconditions demanded by his rivals.The United Nations has said government sieges are responsible for denying the delivery of food and medicine to 187,000 people, while the rebels are besieging 12,000 in government-held towns. Much of the attention has focused on rebel-held Madaya, where the United Nations has documented starvation deaths.On Wednesday, the militant group Hezbollah, which backs Mr. Assad, announced that government forces had cleared a rebel line that had laid siege for three years to two government-held towns: Zahra and Nubol.A resident of Nubol, who gave his name only as Youssef, said residents were running low on flour and fuel and looking forward to the armys advance on the town. We were living under an unjust siege, he said by telephone."}
{"text": "LONDON  Days after a British public inquiry linked President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to the fatal poisoning of her husband, Marina Litvinenko visited a cherished corner of Highgate Cemetery here.Someone, she said, had placed a bright bouquet of red roses on the grave in which Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer turned whistle-blower and Kremlin critic, has been buried since December 2006, after he was poisoned with the rare, expensive and highly toxic isotope polonium 210.Just before he died of radiation sickness, Ms. Litvinenko said in an interview, her husband asked me to explain to people what happened to him, and she agreed  a promise that took over nine years to fulfill in the face of official British opacity and dogged attempts in Russia to undermine her campaign.In that time, there were hard personal choices and legal tangles with some of the most senior officials in Prime Minister David Camerons government. Members of her husbands family turned against her and denounced him as a traitor and a British spy. She risked going broke, and lawyers fought her case pro bono.Finally, on Jan. 21, Sir Robert Owen, a retired senior judge, delivered a 328-page report, blaming two Russian associates of Mr. Litvinenko for delivering the poison in a teapot, an operation described in the document as probably sanctioned by Mr. Putin.So was that the final word? Or even closure? Ms. Litvinenko thinks not.When she visited the graveside, I said: Sasha, I have done it. But it is not the end.Judge Owens findings have been dismissed, denied and ridiculed by the Kremlin and by the two men accused of administering the toxin, Andrei K. Lugovoi and Dmitri V. Kovtun. Against that backdrop, Ms. Litvinenko has a wish list of follow-ups.First of all, Lugovoi and Kovtun to be sentenced. It would complete the criminal case, she said, although the Kremlin has refused to extradite them.Then, she plans to seek redress at the European Court of Human Rights, and she has called for sanctions against members of the Kremlin elite.But, while the British government has announced that Mr. Lugovois and Mr. Kovtuns assets are to be frozen, its appetite for broader reprisals seems limited.Despite the temporary suspension of Syria peace talks in Geneva, The Economist said, the Foreign Office is cautious about jeopardizing relations with the Kremlin, even though Russia has an entirely different agenda in Syria from that of Britain.Moscow is a key patron of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a weighty factor in the realpolitik that has ensnared the Litvinenko case, particularly since Mr. Cameron came to power in 2010.Western strategies, of course, can be taken in several ways. Mr. Putin is ready to defy international norms not because he is offended by the Wests assertiveness, The Economist said, but because he thinks it weak.There are other sources of potential pressure, given the economic stake of wealthy Russians in Londons real estate and investment markets.Ultimately, one consequence may be a deepening of the already widespread belief that, as Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University, wrote in The Moscow Times, if a Russian dies now, especially if in even faintly unexpected circumstances, everyone sees the Kremlins radioactive fingerprints on it.There is the case, for instance, of Alexander Perepilichny, another Russian whistle-blower who was found dead in Britain in 2012 with traces of a rare toxin in his stomach.In the Litvinenko poisoning, Mr. Galeotti wrote, there was a depressing irony.Moscow probably set out to kill a man and did it but has nothing to show for its ruthless success,  he wrote. And in London, an inquiry set up to find the truth probably found it, but it is hard to know what London can do with that knowledge."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re How to Raise a Creative Child (Sunday Review, Jan. 31):What Adam Grant says about the relationship between freedom and creativity is so true. But now I fear that the tiger moms and dads will decide that they can mass-produce creative children merely by cutting back on rules and letting their children follow their hearts. I would argue that the sources of creativity are deeper than that: Creative children tend to have creative parents who encourage and value creativity in their offspring.And if a child does become creative, what then? Not everyone has the gifts or good fortune to achieve success in a creative field. How many bands actually hit the charts? How many novels become best sellers, or are even published? I have seen creative friends struggle for years to break into a field against astronomical odds; most ended up with day jobs.The truth is, unless hes one of a handful of stars, and often even then, the creative person will be punished for his creativity at every stage of his life. School rewards students for completing simple exercises according to schedule. At work, most of the profit and frequently the credit for art and invention accrue to others. Create something too sophisticated, and it wont be understood. Create something uninspiring, and it will be condemned.Creativity and talent are intrinsically fulfilling, but they are cruel taskmasters: Modern society offers the creative person few opportunities, and fewer rewards.JOSHUA P. HILLNew London, Conn.To the Editor:As the parent of two teenage boys who are passionate about building remote-controlled airplanes and now drones, I agree with some of the observations made in the article. My younger son feels very bored and unmotivated in school. However, he not only stays up till 3 a.m. to finish a drone that flies up to 400 feet and takes aerial shots, but also programs electronic chips, makes and sells online special antennas for remote-controlled planes, and solders like a professional.All of this has been possible because both parents have set him free from any specific rules. While we expect a code of respect for his teachers and elders, we do not emphasize grades in school. Since the boys were young, my husband tinkered and did projects with both of them for fun.NIRUPAMA MALLAVARUPUSummit, N.J.To the Editor:As a former Westinghouse Science Talent Search finalist, I completely disagree with Adam Grant that not winning a Nobel Prize or getting into the National Academy of Sciences implies that you are no longer scientifically creative.I am as passionate about science as I was in high school when I did my Westinghouse project. I currently run a National Institutes of Health-funded research lab working on mechanisms of cancer biology, and I like to think that I still do creative science. Many past Westinghouse finalists are doing similar work.While we might never win a Nobel, we are solving interesting and important scientific problems, and training future generations of scientists. Measuring creativity in science by the ability to accumulate prizes is very shortsighted.SANDY CHANGNew HavenThe writer is a professor at the Yale University School of Medicine."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   About 12.7 million people signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act or had their coverage automatically renewed in the third annual open enrollment season, the Obama administration said Thursday.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the signups exceeded her goals and her expectations. Open enrollment for 2016 is over, and we are happy to report it was a success, she said.Most of the plan selections were for people in the 38 states  more than 9.6 million  who used the federal website, HealthCare.gov. The other 3.1 million people were enrolled in states that run their own marketplaces.Ms. Burwell said she was pleased to see that four million of the people signing up through HealthCare.gov were new to the federal insurance marketplace in 2016. This, she said, shows that marketplace coverage is a product people want and need.The administration predicted in October that 11 million to 14 million people would choose health plans for 2016 by the end of open enrollment. The total reported on Thursday is slightly above the midpoint of that range.Ms. Burwell said that 28 percent of consumers who signed up through HealthCare.gov were in the 18-to-34 age bracket, about the same proportion as last year. Insurers had been hoping to see an increase because those consumers tend to be relatively healthy, so money from their premiums is available to help insurers pay for the care of people who are less healthy.The three-month open enrollment period began Nov. 1 and ended on Sunday. People who selected health plans must pay their share of the first months premium to activate their coverage. Enrollment tends to decline during the year as some people fail to pay premiums, some qualify for Medicaid or employer-sponsored insurance, and some drop their marketplace coverage for other reasons.In March 2015, the Obama administration announced that nearly 11.7 million people had selected health plans or had been automatically re-enrolled through the public marketplaces. In September, the administration said, actual enrollment stood at 9.3 million  about 20 percent lower.Federal officials said there might be a smaller decline this year because the new numbers included some cancellations and were therefore more accurate. Still, officials said, they did not know how many of the people with marketplace coverage this year were previously uninsured.The administration said that more than 17 million uninsured people had gained coverage under the health law because of the new public marketplaces, the expansion of Medicaid and the opportunity for young adults to stay on their parents insurance plans until age 26.Administration officials carefully track the enrollment numbers, which they regard as a yardstick for the success of the Affordable Care Act.It is unclear how the enrollment data might affect election-year politics. Republican presidential candidates want to uproot the health care law. In the latest poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, people reporting unfavorable views of the law outnumbered those with favorable views, 44 percent to 41 percent.In vetoing a bill to repeal major parts of the health law last month, President Obama cited changes that have occurred in the last five years.The nations uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever, and demand for marketplace coverage during December 2015 was at an all-time high, Mr. Obama said. Health care costs are lower than expected when the law was passed, and health care quality is higher, with improvements in patient safety saving an estimated 87,000 lives.About seven in 10 consumers who had 2015 coverage through HealthCare.gov returned to the federal marketplace and actively selected plans for 2016, federal officials said. More than half of them switched plans.Four million people used new search tools on HealthCare.gov to find out if particular doctors or prescription drugs were covered  a sign of the seriousness and time they put into their decisions, Ms. Burwell said.Among states using HealthCare.gov, the federal government reported the largest number of signups in Florida (1.7 million), Texas (1.3 million), North Carolina (613,500) and Georgia (587,850).California, which has its own marketplace, reported signups of nearly 1.6 million, including 425,000 new customers.In the last week of open enrollment, nearly 700,000 people signed up or were automatically re-enrolled in coverage through the federal marketplace.Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal marketplace, said he saw a surge in the final week in Miami, Atlanta and Chicago and in Texas cities including Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Laredo."}
{"text": "Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.TODD: Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.MADDOW: We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.MADDOW: And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions  show us the differences between them. Thats the whole reason that were here tonight.Were not here for talking points. Were to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, lets get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that well be addressing tonight.The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.MADDOW: And with that, thats it. Were going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, were going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And theyre giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. Theyre worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. Thats what American democracy is about.TODD: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, Im happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind. CLINTON: Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But theres also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where peoples wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.Im fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and Im not making promises that I cannot keep.TODD: All right.Lets get started.Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, Its very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So please tell us why you think if hes elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. Ive been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and were now on the path to achieving it. I dont want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress weve made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I dont want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I dont believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trumps kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. Its not just enough about what were against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just dont add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. Thats why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Lets go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. Thats what I intend to do.TODD: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and havent gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president youll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?SANDERS: Well, I havent quite run for president before.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Lets deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes theres a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether its the U.K., whether its France, whether its Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America cant do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government cant stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? Its an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Lets make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me...TODD: Go.SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.TODD: Yes, go ahead.SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while were waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here  I helped write that bill  but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then youre too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the partys standard bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But Ive heard Senator Sanders comments, and its really caused me to wonder whos left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if were going to get into labels, I dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.(APPLAUSE)I dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I dont think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedys immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what weve done and what we will do. Thats why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. Thats what Im offering and thats what I will do as president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?SANDERS: No, not at all. Heres the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American peoples needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution  contributors. SANDERS: Now all of the ideas that Im talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.MADDOW: Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Id like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you cant be both a moderate or a progressive, but you cant be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been  Im paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think Im a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.Thats where this came from. It wasnt me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was theres nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you cant be a moderate, you cant a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The worlds financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. Thats the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.CLINTON: Well, Chuck...TODD: ... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said Im a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesnt change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Childrens Defense Fund.It certainly didnt stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare  I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we werent successful, but we kept fighting and we got the childrens health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... I think its important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, thats what you do in campaigns, but at the same time lets not be  in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where Ive always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I dont know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, thats what we ought to be celebrating. Lets talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: (inaudible) 30 seconds, and then well move.SANDERS: Thats right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, lets talk about...CLINTON: ... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, whos not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?SANDERS: Well, Rachel, actually, that wasnt accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It is true, its not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have  when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which Im very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesnt exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And Im very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think its because theyve worked with me, theyve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And thats exactly what I will do.Well get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, were going to make progress together when Im president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. Shes implying that that says something about the people who know you best.SANDERS: Well, I dont see it quite like that.MADDOW: How do you see it?SANDERS: I am  will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. Thats a fact. I dont deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.MADDOW: Secretary.CLINTON: Well, look, Ive got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And Ive got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my lifes work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I am not going to make promises I cant keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON: A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.Im not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I dont want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, youll have 30 seconds to respond to that.SANDERS: What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout ones life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.CLINTON: Yeah, but I  I think its fair to really ask whats behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. Ive tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to  you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really dont think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If youve got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.SANDERS: What...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and Im very proud of that.SANDERS: ... you know...CLINTON: So I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...SANDERS: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... in recent weeks, and lets talk...(BOOING)... lets talk about about the issues. Lets talk about the issues that divide us.SANDERS: Lets talk about  OK, lets talk...CLINTON: And lets  lets...SANDERS: ... let us talk about issues.CLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS: Lets talk about issues.CLINTON: I  I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS: Lets...CLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS: ... lets  lets  lets talk about issues.CLINTON: And so  lets talk about issues.SANDERS: Lets talk  lets talk about issues, all right? Lets talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided  spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.(LAUGHTER)Lets ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and theres nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Lets talk about climate change.Do you think theres a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not  I like...(APPLAUSE)... there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator, I dont think  I dont...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: ... Secretary, were gonna...CLINTON: ... I dont think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And Im proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance. CLINTON: Today, youve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. Im going to stop this game.But while were talking about votes, youre the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I dont know  Im not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and Im certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What weve got to do as Democrats  what weve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.Thats what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thirty seconds.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans  Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan  about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is  was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.TODD: Thank you both.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously weve touched a nerve. Were going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, welcome back. Lets get right to it.Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is  it is in place to run for president. Why arent you walking the walk on that?Why arent you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?SANDERS: Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states  Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states  it just doesnt work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is  I dont know if the secretary would agree  is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.TODD: Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got  and all this when it is  you know, thats the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing  public financing system...SANDERS: But if the...TODD: ... and being able to set  being able to set an example.SANDERS:  but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So whats the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I dont represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didnt want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think thats pretty good.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...CLINTON: On the issue of Wall Street.MADDOW: ... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said thats what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?CLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did  when I left the secretary of States office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying youre going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that, and I think its important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record? SANDERS: Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And thats why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And its been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.I have great respect for Senator Sanderss commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I dont believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And Ive said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.So lets not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I would say that  that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether its Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were  significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Look we have a law  look, you know, I  I appreciate the senators advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because hes a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me  the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys  is because Ive got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know, we cant just fight the last war. Weve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: ... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.SANDERS: Well, weve had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And heres where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.SANDERS: That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way theyre ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. Thats it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.TODD: Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.Secretary Clinton, its addressed to you, and its about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, Dont you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?But, lets make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?CLINTON: I will look into it. I dont know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and  we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on peoples health. Now, if all were going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, were missing the big oil companies. Were missing other big energy companies. Were missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.TODD: Senator, you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead.SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. Thats a fact.And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. Its fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we dont start breaking them up, were going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...CLINTON: ... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think its a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because theyve beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because Ive been in the arena with them time and time again.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way youve approached them in this campaign?SANDERS: Of course I can work with them, but lets be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much theyre paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what were going to do? Were going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.Were going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, thats what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.And with that, were going to take a break.TODD: Well be right back. And were going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back  welcome back to the Democratic candidates debate. Were going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.And Secretary Clinton, were going to start with you. There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for Americas military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops thats fighting ISIS right now?CLINTON: Well, I think what the president understands, and what hes trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.I agree with the president. Ive said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq  that is off the table.But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but theyre doing the fighting. Were doing the support and enabling.And I also think weve got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep  try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW: To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that youre describing requires considerably more of Americans  an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?CLINTON: No. I mean, of course thats a theoretical question, and we dont know what it would be for, and we dont know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think were making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and thats exactly what the president is doing.MADDOW: Thank you, Madam Secretary.TODD: Go ahead, Senator Sanders  30 seconds, your response.SANDERS: OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website,berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002. And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.TODD: All right. Senator, I want to stay, though...CLINTON: If I could  if I could...TODD: Go ahead. 30 seconds.CLINTON: ... respectfully add  look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...(APPLAUSE)... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.TODD: Let me  let  were gonna  were staying  were staying basically on this topic. Obviously youve been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?SANDERS: Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesnt happen.I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen  and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head. SANDERS: And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers  U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, Look, were taking on those terrible Americans.The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.TODD: Can you address a question on Afghanistan?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think theyre going to be there?SANDERS: Well, you cant simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.Hopefully, and you know, one cant predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.TODD: Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.CLINTON: Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top  his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because its not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So, weve got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.TODD: You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You havent given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesnt sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when youre asked about it, and you say youre going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why?SANDERS: Well, thats not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldnt have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didnt get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanderss views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they cant stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON: So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.TODD: All right, Senator, 30 seconds.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience  hat is not arguable  in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didnt.In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. Thats no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.CLINTON: Well, let me just add that, you know, Ive said this before and Im very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.Because I know from my own experience that youve got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, Ill get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.SANDERS: Well...MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, at the  at the last Democratic debate in Charleston  I want to get specific here  Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that hes standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldnt try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.Im very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. Im prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesnt think we should. I certainly dont think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.SANDERS: Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.And youre right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. Theyre Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please dont suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We dont. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary  and you can correct me if Im wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know  let me correct the record.(CROSSTALK)TODD: 30 seconds, madam secretary.CLINTON: As I  as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And youre right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.SANDERS: OK.CLINTON: Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course youve got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you dont just rush in, open the door, and say, Here I am. Lets talk and make a deal.Thats not the way it works.SANDERS: I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesnt do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...CLINTON: ... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. Thats exactly the right...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... And, thats what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.TODD: Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, youve got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to Americas security right now...SANDERS: ... ISIS...TODD: ... Starting with the biggest threat.SANDERS: ISIS, you forgot one...TODD: ... I didnt say that...SANDERS: ... No, no...TODD: ... No...SANDERS: ... ISIS would be ...TODD: ... We already had that. Im talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.SANDERS: Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.TODD: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions...SANDERS: ... No, I dont. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. Thats what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.TODD: Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Hes basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.CLINTON: I havent talked to Secretary Carter, but heres what I would think hes planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, thats an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and theyre working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russias putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and Im glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. Weve got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so theyre actually contributing more to their own defense.TODD: Thank you both, Rachel?MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Partys nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. Its a newly popular idea in conservative politics.How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? Whats your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?CLINTON: Well, first of all, Im absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix whats wrong with the V.A.There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But youre absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. Theyve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think theres where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, lets fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, youve worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way shes talking about this issue?SANDERS: Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired  I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. Thats what I did.And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldnt get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that Id make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. Weve got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, were going to take another break. Well be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: And we are back. Were gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Mondays Iowa caucuses  narrowest of margins. Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do you  or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?SANDERS: Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but lets not blow this out of proportion. This is not a  this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.I think where we now stand  correct me if Im wrong  you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.(LAUGHTER)You know, so this is not  this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register said  you know, there were coin  I think there were half a dozen coin flips  a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how its recounted, it will break roughly even.And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I dont have to say it, because they voted already.(LAUGHTER)And I love New Hampshire, too, because you havent voted, but...(APPLAUSE)... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.TODD: Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if thats what the party wants to do? You good with that?CLINTON: Whatever they decide to do, thats fine.TODD: Thats fair enough. OK.CLINTON: All right.TODD: Good, we move on. Were happy with that. We have more questions.MADDOW: Senator  Senator Sanders, in 1964...SANDERS: Oh (inaudible).(LAUGHTER)See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?MADDOW: In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was, however, far to the right of most of that party. In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his partys mainstream.Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way youre running right now to try to get the nomination?SANDERS: Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw  there may have been a new one  last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But heres why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?CLINTON: I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.(APPLAUSE)And I say that with great  with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and well work together.But what Im concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. Ive been vetted. Theres hardly anything you dont know about me. And I think its fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think Im the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, its not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And thats what Im prepared to...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: Well stay on this issue. Well stay on this topic.TODD: Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again theyre worried about the emails issue, not because they dont believe your explanation, but because its a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.They see your numbers right now and they think its the email issue as to why youre not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isnt going to blow up your candidacy if youre the nominee?CLINTON: Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didnt get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rices aide theyve been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know its an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open  there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?CLINTON: I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if theres going to be a security review about me, theres going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because weve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.Honest to goodness, this is  this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but weve got to get to the bottom of whats really going on here, and I hope that will happen.TODD: Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didnt give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE)TODD: Youre right. Im trying to  its a  its a family hour still right now. After 11:00, Ill say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well shes getting slapped with the email controversy.Are you  how are you feeling about these darn emails now?SANDERS: I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. Theres a process under way. I will not politicize it.TODD: OK. Senator Sanders, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And by the way  and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesnt know that theres not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public.Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?SANDERS: Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.MADDOW: Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.SANDERS: But that was only for  that was not to be on television. Thats an important point. That was just something  as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue? CLINTON: No.MADDOW: And with that, we will (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates debate.Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. Its a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?CLINTON: Yes, I do. And  you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clintons support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...SANDERS: ... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are  all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. Its hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. Thats number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just dont believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. Theyre never going to get out. But, I just dont want to see government be part of killing. Thats all. (APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that.The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today. If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayors invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a childs life. I know from the work that Ive done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan wont do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?SANDERS: Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.SANDERS: You know, I dont go around asking for governors resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. Thats what were talking about. We dont know, no one knows for sure because they havent done the appropriate studies, but theres no question that kids intellectual development may have been impacted. We dont know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says, youre not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.MADDOW: Senator, thank you.TODD: Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade. In the 90s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then  which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.If elected, should Democrats expect that once youre in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?CLINTON: You know, Chuck, Ive only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the worlds population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. Thats the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So its not just whats in the trade agreement that Im interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.TODD: Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since youve been in Congress.SANDERS: Absolutely right.TODD: But if you do that as president...(APPLAUSE)TODD: If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?SANDERS: Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.I was not only in opposition to NAFTA  and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood  I dont think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didnt believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, its to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I dont want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I dont want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.SANDERS: So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, Hey, you dont want to take a cut in pay? Were going to China.Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Thank you both.Were going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back well squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. Well be right back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes.MADDOW: The home stretch.TODD: The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question. Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. Youre going to have to make choices. And theres a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesnt.TODD: So there are three big lifts that youve talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.CLINTON: Well, I  I dont accept that premise, Chuck. I think that weve got so much business we have to do. Weve talked a lot tonight about what were against  were against income inequality. Were against the abuses of powerful interests. Were against a lot of things.Im for a lot of things. I dont want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if Im so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.(APPLAUSE)I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.(APPLAUSE)Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and were not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces  because thats the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure  we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.TODD: All right, but Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)... youve still got to do something first. As you know, history said  shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.SANDERS: No, let...TODD: Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.SANDERS: ... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that.(APPLAUSE)But you miss  when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is youre not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.(APPLAUSE)So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if Im elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.(APPLAUSE)Second point  second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country  largely African-American and Latino  the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No, you just cant negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.And as president, thats what I will work hard on.(APPLAUSE)TODD: OK. Thank you.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government  which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops  is  is there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create?CLINTON: The answer to both of those is no. Im interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesnt work, and be absolutely clear were getting rid of what doesnt work.I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better  better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what its going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think its not appropriate to say Im going to get rid of this, get rid of that until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think its the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans heres what were trying to get done, heres why I need your help, heres why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isnt something you care about, but Im telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows MADDOW: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON:  it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that youve got people with you every step of the way. Thats what I want to do.MADDOW: Thank you very much. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton, youve made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see CLINTON: I never said that.TODD: But do you see  do you see a vice president?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Look TODD: Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?CLINTON: Well, Im certainly going to unite the party, but Im not  Im not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If Im so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Senator, would you consider the secretary?SANDERS: I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldnt be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope its mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Thats true. Thats true.(CROSSTALK)TODD: Secretary Clinton, closing statements. You are first.CLINTON: Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, Im asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.You know, we didnt get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you weve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I  my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didnt have any money, couldnt speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people, that doesnt guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.Im running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Well, there you have it. I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just dont have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I dont think so.Our debate coverage  (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.MADDOW: We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I cant wait to see how it turns out. Dont screw up.TODD: Well see you in a few minutes. Thank you.MADDOW: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)END"}
{"text": "In this tender, funny, but none too daring film, Adam, a regular guy who works as a mechanic in his little hometown, comes out on his 24th birthday. After a night of serious partying, he shares the news with his three lifelong buddies, who are completely gobsmacked.As an ensemble, Adam (Evan Todd, from Grumpy Cats Worst Christmas Ever and Heathers: The Musical) and his friends, played by Parker Young, Chord Overstreet and Jon Gabrus, work together almost as one being, as many close friends do. It takes some adjustment, and a great deal of hilarity, to restore their communal equilibrium as they cycle through their poker games, their backyard workout sessions and other rituals. They try to be cool but manage to stumble into every potentially offensive assumption and unintended double entendre.When, with their encouragement, Adam tries some dating apps, he finds a parade of ultra-losers. (Rule No. 1: Do not list Scarface as your favorite film.) The most amusing is the creepy Bradstar. Dishonest, slimy and unaware of his own pathologies, he lives an upstairs-downstairs existence and brags about his basement lair, complete with an Xbox 360. He invites Adam to spend Fourth of July in the basement, far from the fireworks, and even promises to sneak down with a portion of his wifes outstanding potato salad.Much of the humor in 4th Man Out comes from the broadly drawn ancillary characters, like Martha, a fanatically churchgoing neighbor whos always at the door, offering up muffins, her niece and, ultimately, pamphlets for a sexual orientation conversion camp that arrive accompanied by an elaborately decorated Virgin Mary sheet cake.But the director, Andrew Nackman, in making a super-mainstream film, leans so far toward the feel-good end of the spectrum that he forgoes the opportunity to make something that is more real, more fraught, more complex, but still entertaining and accessible to the Marthas of this world."}
{"text": "Stocks posted modest gains on Thursday as investors awaited Fridays jobs report, which could offer insight into the state of the United States economy and help determine whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again next month.Many contend the likelihood of another rate increase in March has faded because of recent signs of weakness in the global economy. The dollar has moved lower compared with other currencies, a welcome change for United States exporters whose overseas sales have been hurt by the appreciation of the dollar in the last year and a half.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,416.58. The Standard & Poors 500-stock index rose 2.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,915.45, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,509.56.Stocks oscillated between gains and losses, and got some traction in the last few hours of trading. Industrial and materials companies were among the biggest gainers, helped by a weaker dollar.Investors were getting ready for Fridays payroll numbers. Economists surveyed by FactSet forecast that United States employers created 200,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent.In the last few weeks, investors have scaled back expectations that the Fed would continue raising interest rates because of signs that the global slowdown in growth is beginning to hurt the American economy.On Wednesday, a private survey found that the service sector grew in January at the slowest rate in nearly two years. Fed funds futures, securities that allow investors to bet on which way the Fed will move interest rates, are indicating that the next best chance the Fed will raise rates is not until early 2017.The market is starting to price in a small chance of recession, not some realistic chance, but enough of a chance to give investors pause and reposition, said Khoa Le, a leader of a derivatives trading desk at Credit Suisse.Diminished expectations of an increase in interest rates have continued to weaken the dollar. The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.1203 while the dollar fell 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen to 116.75 yen.Mr. Le said the large move in the dollar in recent days was partly related to a great unwinding of positions by large investors and companies that might hold significant amounts of cash overseas.Many investors were buying into this thesis of a strong dollar, he said. Now that the Fed is less likely to raise rates, we are seeing clients reposition.Government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.85 percent from 1.88 percent.In other company news, the social network LinkedIn said it finished last year with better-than-expected financial results, but it offered a weak forecast for 2016 that sent the companys stock plunging more than 25 percent.Earnings and revenue at LinkedIn beat Wall Streets estimates for the fourth quarter of 2015, but the company still reported a loss of $8.4 million, compared with a $3 million profit a year earlier. And it issued a forecast that was far below what analysts were expecting.The mobile video camera maker GoPro plunged 93 cents, or 9 percent, to $9.78 after the company reported a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. GoPro shares were down 46 percent in 2016.Viacom rose $1.11, or 2 percent, to $48.68 after the company announced that its 92-year-old majority shareholder, Sumner Redstone, was stepping down as executive chairman to be replaced by its chief, Philippe Dauman.It was an usually quiet day for energy commodities, which for several days had wild swings. Benchmark United States crude edged down 56 cents to $31.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract jumped 8 percent on Wednesday in New York.Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil prices, fell 58 cents, to $34.46 a barrel in London.Other energy commodities were mixed. Heating oil rose less than a penny, to $1.081 a gallon; wholesale gasoline rose 1.5 cents, to $1.0284 a gallon; and natural gas fell 6.6 cents, to $1.972 per thousand cubic feet.In metals, gold rose $16.30, to $1,157.60 an ounce; silver rose 11.6 cents, to $14.85 an ounce; and copper rose 3.7 cents, to $2.1315 a pound."}

{"text": "Floaters, those small dots or cobweb-shaped patches that move or float through the field of vision, can be alarming. Though many are harmless, if you develop a new floater, you need to be seen pretty quickly by an eye doctor in order to rule out a retinal tear or detachment, said Dr. Rebecca Taylor, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.Floaters are caused by clumping of the vitreous humor, the gel-like fluid that fills the inside of the eye. Normally, the vitreous gel is anchored to the back of the eye. But as you age, it tends to thin out and may shrink and pull away from the inside surface of the eye, causing clumps or strands of connective tissue to become lodged in the jelly, much as strands of thread fray when a button comes off on your coat, Dr. Taylor said. The strands or clumps cast shadows on the retina, appearing as specks, dots, clouds or spider webs in your field of vision.Such changes may occur at younger ages, too, particularly if you are nearsighted or have had a head injury or eye surgery. There is no treatment for floaters, though they usually fade with time.But its still important to see a doctor if new floaters arise because the detaching vitreous gel can pull on the retina, causing it to tear, which can lead to retinal detachment, a serious condition. The pulling or tugging on the retina may be perceived as lightning-like flashes, like a strobe light off to the side of your vision, Dr. Taylor said.See an eye doctor within 24 to 48 hours if you have a new floater, experience a sudden storm of floaters, see a gray curtain or shadow move across your field of vision, or have a sudden decrease in vision.Do you have a health question?\n\t\t Submit your question to Ask Well.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Bernie Sanders is 74. He grew up playing stickball in the streets of Brooklyn and watching a black-and-white television.Yet this child of the 1940s, who says Franklin D. Roosevelt is his favorite president, has inspired a potent political movement among young people today. College students wear shaggy white Bernie wigs on campus, carry iPhones with his image as their screen saver and flock to his events by the thousands.And armies of young voters are turning what seemed like a long-shot presidential candidacy into a surprisingly competitive campaign.He may seem like some old geezer who doesnt care about stuff, said Caroline Buddin, 24, a sales associate in Charleston, S.C. But if you actually give him the time of day and listen to what he has to say, he has a lot of good ideas.In interviews, young supporters of the Vermont senators presidential bid almost all offer some version of the same response when asked why they like him: He seems sincere.For the generation that researchers say has been the most bombarded with marketing slogans and advertising pitches, Mr. Sanders, a former mayor of Burlington, Vt., has a certain unpolished appeal.The first group of students working to elect Mr. Sanders president sprang up at Middlebury College in Vermont. There are now similar chapters at more than 220 campuses across the country, with the biggest one at the University of California at Berkeley.The movement, at least initially, was not so much the result of an organized effort by the Sanders campaign, but more of a visceral response to the candidate himselfIt seems like he is at the point in his life when he is really saying what he is thinking, said Olivia Sauer, 18, a college freshman who returned to her hometown, Ames, Iowa, to caucus for Mr. Sanders.With Hillary, she said, sometimes you get this feeling that all of her sentences are owned by someone.Young voters support for Mr. Sanders has created a quandary in Hillary Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, where millennial staff members have tried to persuade their peers to back the former secretary of state, using social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram. On Monday in Iowa, Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton among voters ages 17 to 29 by 70 percentage points, greater than the 43-percentage-point margin by which Barack Obama won that age group in Iowa in 2008.That is true among men and women, and even Mrs. Clinton called the gap amazing during an appearance on CNN on Wednesday.The day after Mrs. Clinton, 68, eked out a win over Mr. Sanders in Iowa, her campaign held a conference call with prominent Democratic supporters. Several of the officials, who are delegates to the partys convention, expressed concerns about the campaigns sometimes awkward attempts to reach young voters, including its reliance on baby boomer celebrities who have less resonance with the millennial generation.Im very close to Jamie Lee Curtis and I know she was there, but shes not young anymore, Rosalind Wyman, a prominent Democrat in Los Angeles, said of the 57-year-old actress and spokeswoman for Activia yogurt, who campaigned for Mrs. Clinton in Iowa.On the phone call, Marlon Marshall, the director of state campaigns and political engagement, tried to assure the group that the Clinton operation would be using more youthful surrogates, including Mrs. Clintons 35-year-old daughter, Chelsea, and would continue to talk about issues like college affordability.I do believe a narrative will continue, Mr. Marshall said. The Sanders campaign, he added, will keep drumming that.Mrs. Clintons support among young voters has fallen in the eight years since she last ran for president. In the 2008 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, 60 percent of voters ages 18 to 24 supported Mr. Obama, while those ages 25 to 29 split their support between the two candidates, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.Some 87 percent of likely New Hampshire primary voters ages 18 to 29 said they would vote for Mr. Sanders in the states primary on Tuesday, compared with 13 percent for Mrs. Clinton, according to a UMass-Lowell poll conducted Feb. 1 to 3.Sarah King-Mayes, 18, a freshman at the University of New Hampshire, volunteers three or four times a week for the Sanders campaign. She says she plans to register to vote on Tuesday in New Hampshire, instead of waiting to vote in Massachusetts, where her family lives.She started supporting Mr. Sanders last summer after she took an online quiz, which concluded her views most matched those of the senator, particularly on issues like racial injustice and climate change.I am excited for the political revolution, Ms. King-Mayes said. Because I am excited for an actual democracy to be reinstated where politicians cannot be bought out by whatever company, I guess, wants their votes.Mrs. Clintons campaign says she will win over young voters when they learn more about her proposals to make college affordable and to combat climate change. The difference for young voters and for all voters is the ability to get something done, Robby Mook, her campaign manager said in an interview with MSNBC this week. And what that takes is someone in Washington who can break through the gridlock.That argument won over Iris Brenner, 21, a student at Iowa State University in Ames, who supports Mrs. Clinton. For me, its been, Do I caucus for someone who is a little less exciting but who can get stuff done?Privately, Mrs. Clintons supporters say that while being a youth icon has its advantages, the support of middle-aged and older voters is enough for her to capture the nomination. In the Iowa caucuses, she beat Mr. Sanders by 23 points among voters ages 45 to 64 and by 43 points among voters 65 and older, according to exit polls.They dont have to be for me, Im going to be for them, Mrs. Clinton told CNN on Wednesday when asked about the generation gap.The Sanders campaign said excitement among young people had been organic, although it has clearly worked to improve the candidates appeal on sites like Twitter, Reddit and Snapchat, and in text messages to supporters. Young people are idealistic and they look at this country and say we can be much more, Mr. Sanders told reporters Wednesday.The discomfort, and, in some cases hostility toward Mrs. Clinton among young voters is striking. Some of them, feeling the pinch of economic hardship or the burden of college loans, suggest she is too cozy with big banks and corporate America. But polls also show they do not find her trustworthy.The scene at the party for Mr. Sanders on the night of the Iowa caucuses captured their feelings. As Mrs. Clinton appeared on several large projector screens, telling her supporters she was breathing a sigh of relief to learn of the Iowa results, some young members of the Sanders crowd booed loudly.I am a progressive who gets things done for people, Mrs. Clinton said, setting off more heckling from the Sanders supporters. Shes a liar, the group chanted angrily.Even those showing up to the Clinton campaigns youth-oriented events do not seem to be embracing her candidacy.Last month in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton appeared at a joint rally in Iowa City with the 23-year-old pop star Demi Lovato. Like many college students in the crowd, Nate Weger, 20, said he was supporting Mr. Sanders but was not going to say no to a free Demi Lovato concert.Bernie just seems a lot more honest when he talks, Mr. Weger said. Similar sentiments were voiced at an Iowa event for Mrs. Clinton featuring Lena Dunham, the creator and star of the HBO show Girls.Pete DAlessandro, Mr. Sanderss campaign director in Iowa, said such efforts could be futile. He recalled a story from 1968, during Robert F. Kennedys primary fight against Eugene McCarthy, when the McCarthy campaign held a barbecue that attracted hundreds of voters, leading some to believe he had deep support.But Mr. McCarthy ended up losing the contest badly.They just came for the ribs, Mr. DAlessandro said with a chuckle."}

{"text": "Louis C. K. rolled out his new drama, Horace and Pete, last Saturday with no advance warning, via his website, and it appears he plans to promote the show in the same fashion.On Thursday the comedian sent a message to his email list elaborating on his motivations and plans for the series, which, based on the first episode, is a poignant but acerbic story about an argumentative family who owns a Brooklyn bar. Mr. C. K. writes, directs and stars in the show, which may best be described as a Cheers spec script by Eugene ONeill: a snapshot of a family  and a country  suffering a hangover decades in the making, James Poniewozik wrote in The Times.The cast also includes esteemed actors like Alan Alda, Jessica Lange, Edie Falco and Steve Buscemi.While the premiere episode is priced at $5, the next installment, coming Saturday, will be $2 and future ones will be $3, though Mr. C. K. didnt specify how many episodes there will be in total.Why did Mr. C. K. charge you five dollars for Horace and Pete, where most TV shows you buy online are 3 dollars or less? Well, the dirty unmovable fact is that this show is expensive, he wrote, including an expletive for emphasis.Basically this is a handmade, one guy paid for it version of a thing that is usually made by a giant corporation, he added.The distribution on the comedians site allows episodes to debut publicly very soon after they are shot, Mr. C. K. wrote, even though Horace and Pete is a full on TV production with four broadcast cameras. (The premiere included references to this weeks Iowa caucus.) Im making this show as youre watching it, he wrote.The online release also allows viewers to watch the show without expectations, something Mr. C. K. said was part of the point. As a TV watcher Im always delighted when I can see a thing without knowing anything about it because of the promotion, he wrote. So making this show and just posting it out of the blue gave me the rare opportunity to give you that experience of discovery.Its fun to talk about, he added. But for now I want to shut up and not ruin the experience of you just watching the show."}
{"text": "The Hague  After the death of an artist, you can have a new look, a fresh look, and suddenly you can see things that you didnt see before, Franz Kaiser, the curator of a retrospective of work by the Dutch artist Karel Appel at the Gemeentemuseum here, said as he walked past Appels deceptively childlike early canvases and sculpture.Appel, who died in 2006 at 85, seemed destined to have a respected but not transcendent career. His involvement with CoBrA, a short-lived postwar avant-garde movement in northern Europe, attracted a flurry of attention, and he made a splash in New York in the late 1950s. But later works were received more coolly as tastes shifted away from paint on canvas.Now, thanks largely to the Karel Appel Foundation, established in Amsterdam in 1999 by Appel, Mr. Kaiser and others, Appels art has returned to the public eye and research supported by the foundation has introduced new ways of thinking about the artist. That research informs the Gemeentemuseum retrospective, part of a surprisingly fertile run of Appel exhibitions that started in New York in 2014 with a show at the gallery Blum & Poe.Im tackling two clichs, said Mr. Kaiser, the Gemeentemuseums director of exhibitions. One is that Appel was always identified with CoBrA and the other one is that Karel was just messing around  a reference to the artists own description of his work.Appel has long been associated with childlike imagery  birds or animals and strange hybrid beasts painted in bold forms with vibrant colors  and the playful, anything-goes spirit of the  CoBrA group (active from 1948 to 1951 and named for the cities of its adherents, Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam). But Mr. Kaiser said Appels work was rooted in a more classical artistic tradition.To make that point, the Gemeentemuseum first presents visitors with large-scale nudes that Appel painted over the course his career. The thick brushwork gives them the look of abstract topographical body maps.This is probably the most classical theme you can think of, the thing thats most identified with academicism, Mr. Kaiser said, pointing to paintings made in 1953, 1962, 1990 and 2000. You wouldnt expect Karel Appel to do that, but he did it all the time.Subsequent galleries are devoted to landscapes and portraits. The exhibition includes nearly 70 paintings, many of them surprisingly monumental for an artist associated with smaller canvases, and about 25 drawings, some of them preliminary sketches, which proves that Appel was often far from spontaneous.There is also a surprising range of sculptural works, some reminiscent of Brancusi bronzes and others resembling Mike Kelleys contemporary assemblages.Im a little bit surprised by all this, because for a while nothing happened to Appel, the artists widow, Harriet Appel, said in a telephone interview. I see that many people are getting interested in Appel again, and theres new research about Appel, there are younger artists now looking at Appel, and all these things shed a new light on that oeuvre.The 2014 show at Blum & Poe was followed by a smaller solo exhibition at the Frieze Masters fair in London.  In October, the Pompidou Center in Paris mounted an exhibition of Appels drawings that is now at the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich until April 17. An exhibition of painting and sculpture is planned for this year at the Phillips Collection in Washington, and a retrospective is scheduled at the Muse dArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 2017.Appel is a name thats peripherally known in the U.S. but there havent been any significant exhibitions here in over 20 years, Matt Bangser, a partner at Blum & Poe, said in a telephone interview, adding that he had approached the foundation for work to sell.Our hope was that by doing these kinds of historical projects it would draw attention to the work, either for the first time for some people or introduce the later work to people who already knew the earlier work, he said.After CoBrA disbanded in 1951, Appel worked almost continually until his death, always trying new styles.He had moved to Paris in 1950, where Michel Tapi included him in his manifesto exhibition, Un Art Autre. There, Appel met the New York art dealer Martha Jackson, who took him on in 1954.Appel then moved to New York in 1957. Jackson introduced him to the Abstract Expressionist painters there, including Willem de Kooning, who had an enormous impact on his work, and to jazz musicians like Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Count Basie.A fallow period began at the end of the 1960s, when Appel suffered a series of tragedies. Within a period of two years, Jackson, Appels mother and his second wife, Machteld, all died. At the same time, contemporary artists declared painting a dead art form, and Appel, like many painters of his generation, saw his work go out of fashion.By the mid-1970s, however, when he met Harriet, who became his third and last wife, he was working again. Appel then attracted the attention of the influential New York dealer Annina Nosei, who also represented Jean-Michel Basquiat. He lived in the United States for much of the rest of his life, although his official residence was in Monaco.The reappraisal of Appel is in a sense following two different directions on two different continents. When Blum & Poe was organizing its 2014 retrospective, Mr. Kaiser told Mr. Bangser, You have to discover CoBrA for your clients; I have to get rid of it.The Blum & Poe shows did not sell out, Mr. Bangser said, but a few key works sold for strong prices, including two works from Appels CoBrA period, Square Cat (1951), which sold for  $730,000, and Homme et Femme (1952), which brought about $770,000.Similar prices have been achieved for Appel at auction. In December, Sothebys in Paris sold a 1961 painting for 465,000, about $510,000, more than doubling its presale estimate of 150,000 to 200,000.These exhibitions might consolidate the market rather than give it a big push, said Jetske Homan van der Heide, a specialist on Dutch and Belgian prewar art at Christies in Amsterdam. It convinces people that hes a serious artist, that he has his place in a sort of northern European artistic development. Its the CoBrA work that is still the top of his market.For the exhibition at the Gemeentemuseum, however, the target audience is Dutch art lovers who feel that they already know Appel too well.There are magnificent paintings here, Mr. Kaiser said. He was a great painter, and many people cant see it because of certain preconceptions and expectations they have. I want to change that."}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont plans to travel to New York this weekend to appear on Saturday Night Live, interrupting his campaign in New Hampshire for some national television exposure, according to a senior campaign official.Larry David, who has played the senator several times on the show to wide acclaim, will host  the episode and interview Mr. Sanders. The visit comes as Mr. Sanders is seeking to notch his first victory of the nominating contest in New Hampshire, where he holds a comfortable lead in polls over Hillary Clinton.Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump have already appeared on S.N.L. during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton appeared in October alongside her comedic doppelgnger Kate McKinnon, who played Mrs. Clinton nursing a scalding hot vodka at a dive bar as she overhears people talking about voting for Mr. Trump; the actual Mrs. Clinton was behind the bar, pretending to be a regal bartender and neutral observer in a pressed white dress shirt with the name Val.In November, Mr. Trump played a presidential candidate with two well-coiffed doppelgngers who tried to outboast him. Mr. David also loudly heckled Mr. Trump and called him a racist from off stage.To mark Mr. Sanderss appearance, Saturday Night Live tweeted out  a brief video of Mr. David doing his Sanders imitation.

{"text": "When a blogger uses her multiracial family to make a public point, racist attacks may be inevitable. Is she right to take that risk  and to make that choice for her children?Recently Kristen Howerton, author of the popular parenting blog Rage Against the Minivan, wrote about diversity in her childrens doll collections. Ms. Howerton, who is white and has two biological daughters who are white and two adopted sons who are black, was disturbed by a viral video in which two young white girls were given black dolls, seemingly as a joke, and reacted with dismay. As part of her response, she included a video of her own daughters enthusiastic response to receiving a much-wanted black American Girl doll for Christmas, which she also posted on YouTube.Ms. Howertons post was measured and thoughtful  and not at all unusual for her blog, which frequently explores the topics of race and multiculturalism, as well as subjects like raising children, faith and navigating social media.But what happened next is a reminder of the risks we take when we put our views, along with our photos and our families, online.Ms. Howertons post and video caught the attention of a group in Sweden that describes itself as a myth challenger. Among the myths challenged in the groups recent videos and posts are what really happened at Auschwitz and identical twin studies prove homosexuality is not genetic. The organization used Ms. Howertons video, along with other footage of her speaking and images of her family, in its own commentary, which expressed views that were fundamentally at odds with those Ms. Howerton had expressed. That video unleashed a torrent of unwanted attention from the groups followers, leading to a series of attacks against Ms. Howerton on Twitter and on her own YouTube channel.The tweets are shocking and unprintable, laced with racial epithets and offensive comments. Many suggested that the boys in the family might harm their young sisters. Others used altered photos of Ms. Howertons children or family, placing racist images over the face of her son, and superimposing a racist slogan over a picture of the entire family. Others tweeted vulgarities and accused Ms. Howerton of child abuse. The comments on YouTube were similar.Ms. Howertons initial response was to delete many of the comments under her video, and report the Twitter accounts herself. But eventually she decided to fight back. She not only left the posts for all to see on YouTube, but she retweeted the abuse on Twitter, and asked her virtual community of supporters to report the harassment so that Twitter would suspend the abusive accounts.Her followers rallied, calling on their friends to help and witness the attacks. Soon, the deluge of offensive posts was broken up by words of encouragement.If youd like to see just a small sampling of racism in America, visit @kristenhowertons feed, wrote one supporter.Not everyone agreed with Ms. Howertons decision to face down her attackers, just as not everyone agrees with her decision to make her family public in the first place. Many peoples response has been, you put your kids on the Internet, so  Ms. Howerton said. But although she was aware of the risks, she believes there are limits. Posting something on the Internet isnt giving permission to everyone else to use it. Not that it wont happen. Im not kicking the dust saying, how could a picture I put on the Internet be re-used. But its still my picture and my property.While Ms. Howerton and her supporters report Twitter accounts for abuse, she is also asking YouTube to take down the video commentary that makes use of her video and other family images. She has filed a privacy complaint, which YouTube rejected, and is waiting for it to respond to her new complaint, alleging copyright violation. Neil Richards, a law professor at Washington University and author of Intellectual Privacy: Rethinking Civil Liberties in the Digital Age, said he thinks Ms. Howertons belief that she can regain control of the footage may be overly optimistic.The use of home video and family images for political debate is something that has real consequences, he said. She has made her life choices, her experiences, her children experiences, a matter for public debate. When people do this they do expose themselves to criticism and attacks and some of them are quite unpleasant.Eric Goldman, a professor of law and director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law, agreed that because Ms. Howerton herself used family video as part of a political discussion, she may have little legal recourse  when that video is used as part of a larger video engaged in social commentary on the same topic. In many situations, videos or pictures posted online can become fair game for critics to use in online attacks against the posters position or for other undesirable political or social statements, Mr. Goldman said in an email.I personally think it generally violates our social norms to use someone elses children as tools to advance a social cause or make social commentary, he wrote. However, if the social question is how children react or respond to receiving dolls of other races, perhaps thats unavoidable.Ms. Howerton herself can delete the comments under her own YouTube video. On Twitter, some of the accounts that have attacked Ms. Howerton and her family have been suspended; some have not. Twitter  makes the determination about what constitutes hate or harassment. (A representative of Twitter said that as a matter of policy, it will not comment on individual accounts.)For her part, Ms. Howerton said the experience has not dissuaded her from writing about her life and her family. Ill still be out there, she said. I feel that I have a purpose in my platform and that purpose is talking about race, its talking about vulnerable children, its mobilizing people to be more anti-racist and to consider adopting older foster kids, and Im not going to let something like this deter that.Her reaction encourages Danielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland and the author of Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, who notes that the support of the overall online community is key.  Anyone who makes a living writing and speaking can catch the attention of a hate group anytime, she said, and shouldnt be expected to shoulder the blame for the attacks. There is nothing that constitutes a meaningful provocation for something like this, she said. The more we recognize that, the less destructive these kinds of attacks will be.It isnt just the racist attacks that could silence Ms. Howerton, and deter other parents from writing and sharing their family experiences online. Its the shame and fear that accompanies those attacks  the sense of being judged for putting their childrens images at risk, and the fear that their children will suffer as a result. The racist attacks themselves may be inevitable, but the judgment is not.We need Ms. Howerton, and other parents like her, to be willing to share their different stories, and, yes, the stories of their children. Theres a reason this debate is being waged over videos of children opening dolls at Christmas, Mr. Richards said. As humans we love stories and we love to individualize. Thats how we make sense of the world.With the stories, were talking about people. Without them, its all abstract. To have a real conversation about race, we need some people willing to stand up and take a bigger risk. To support that conversation, the rest of us need to stand with them."}

A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events. Bronx Museum of the Arts: Martin Wong: Human Instamatic (through Feb. 14) Fervor, desire and coded insider-outsider knowledge crackle through this career retrospective of one of our great 20th-century American visionaries. Expanding on an earlier survey at the New Museum, the Bronx exhibition takes the artist from precocious juvenilia to unearthly little pictures done the year before his death from AIDS in 1999. Along with his art we have the traces of his countercultural life as mythologist, homoeroticist, existential tourist and urban resurrectionist. And all revolves around his mystical visions of ghetto New York. Neighborhood buildings are fortresslike, crushing, sinister. Yet miracles abound: Windows glow gold; night skies bloom with stars. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) Brooklyn Historical Society: Personal Correspondence: Photography and Letter Writing in Civil War Brooklyn (through June 19) Symbolically, the Civil War ended when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant in the spring of 1865. For many people who lived through it, though, the war never ended at all, and it lives on in letters sent to and from the battlefield. Thousands of these ended up half-forgotten in attics and bureau drawers; a small stash comes to light in this exhibition that consists of just one little room with a lot in it  including letters, Civil War souvenirs and explanatory texts  with everything as readily accessible as if in a well-packed suitcase. 128 Pierrepont Street, near Clinton Street, Brooklyn Heights, 718-222-4111, brooklynhistory.org. (Cotter)Brooklyn Museum: Agitprop! (through Aug. 7) Most art is political, whether its means to be or not, and politics is what this group exhibition is all about. Photography, prints and performance are favored media because theyre, in different ways, portable, readily legible, easily reproducible and disposable  ready to change as the news changes. The Brooklyn Museum show has change built in. Its been conceived as an exhibition in progress, and at this point, early in its run, it looks like one, only half there and thin. But theres more to come in cumulative stages, with artists chosen by artists already in the show joining on Feb. 17 and again on April 6. Among the later arrivals will be young activist collectives like Occupy Museums and Not an Alternative. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter) Guggenheim Museum: Photo-Poetics: An Anthology (through March 27) Formally complex and expressively reserved, even hermetic, the work by 10 photographers in this stimulating show has roots in Conceptualism and takes language, history and speculative thinking as its raw materials. Photographs are structured with the equivalent of poetrys metrical cadences and internal rhymes, and treated less as generators of translatable ideas than of suggestive metaphors. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter) Jewish Museum: Unorthodox (through March 27) With about 200 putatively unorthodox works crowded into tightly walled-in spaces, this lively show has the feel of an Outsider Art fair  in a good way. The paintings, drawings, collages, assemblages, ceramics, weavings and videos are variously funny, funky, quirky, eccentric, idiosyncratic and visionary. Are they truly unorthodox by the standards of a contemporary art world wherein no one wants to be thought orthodox? No, but thats O.K. Its an entertaining and intermittently exhilarating exhibition nonetheless. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)Metropolitan Museum of Art: Artistic Furniture of the Gilded Age (through May 1) In December, the Met unveiled a beautiful new period room in the American Wing: the Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room, which was created in the early 1880s by the heretofore little-known cabinetmaker and interior decorator George A. Schastey (18391894). A two-part exhibition in neighboring galleries focuses on individual work by Schastey, including an extravagantly ornamented Steinway grand piano. Also featured are sumptuous furnishings and decorative objects made for the palatial William H. Vanderbilt House by Herter Brothers, one of Schasteys chief competitors. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson) Metropolitan Museum of Art: Celebrating the Arts of Japan: The Mary Griggs Burke Collection (continuing) This lavish roll out of 160 objects came to the Met from the Mary and Jackson Burke Foundation last spring. The Burkes loved Japanese art  all of it  and the collection is close to compendious in terms of media, from wood-carved Buddhas to bamboo baskets, with a particular strength in painting, early and late. The quality of the work? Japan thinks highly enough of it to have made the Burke holdings the first Japanese collection from abroad ever to show at Tokyo National Museum. Some pieces on view now will be rotated out and replaced in February, making this an exhibition to visit at least twice. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)Metropolitan Museum of Art: Reconstructions: Recent Photographs and Video from the Met Collection (through March 13) This show is not framed as a showcase of whats new, hot or trending, but rather includes 18 works by 15 artists acquired during the past seven years  work that Met curators think will endure historically. Among those on view are Moyra Daveys photographs of record store patrons and vinyl record bins, printed on fold-up mailers; Lucas Blalocks example of photography in the post-Internet era, which contains perverse digitally tweaked passages; as well as a deceptively simple image by Sarah Charlesworth, a leading member of the Pictures Generation, who died in 2013 but remains influential. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) Metropolitan Museum of Art: Wordplay: Matthias Buchingers Drawings From the Collection of Ricky Jay (through April 11) A draftsman, calligrapher, magician and musician, Matthias Buchinger (16741739) traveled all over Northern Europe to entertain kings and aristocrats as well as hoi polloi with feats of physical dexterity. He was especially noted for elaborate drawings featuring biblical passages written in letters too small to be read by ordinary naked eyes. This he managed despite having been born without hands or legs: His arms ended at the elbows and his lower extremities were truncated at the upper thighs. Sixteen of his amazing works are featured in this exhibition. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson) MoMA PS1: Greater New York (through March 7) With a multigenerational team of organizers, MoMA PS1s every-five-years-roundup of New York art steps away from its founding premise of newness, the idea that it would be an update on the metropolitan market. The 158 artists on the roster range from 20-something to 80-something; a few are deceased. The notion that an emerging artist has to be young is discarded. Older artists newly in the spotlight, or back after a long delay, qualify. And history works in two directions. Art from the 1970s and 80s is presented as prescient of whats being made now, and new art is viewed as putting a trenchant spin on the past. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)Museum of Arts and Design: Wendell Castle Remastered (through Feb. 28) This eminent woodworker became noted in the 1960s for carving chic, curvy furniture out of blocks of laminated wood. In the past four years he has revived that method with the assistance of digital and robotic technologies that enable him to make bigger and more adventurous works. This engaging show focuses on pieces from those two periods. Suspended Disbelief, made this year, has an irregularly oval, glossy black table top extending horizontally and without legs some 10 feet in the air from a trio of tall conical forms resembling the tips of monstrous tendrils. Its spectacular. 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)Museum of Modern Art: Endless House: Intersections of Art and Architecture (through March 6) This scattered but enjoyable exhibition, drawn from the museums art collection as much as its design holdings, focuses on the single-family home as a place of experimentation and regeneration; of conflict as well as dreams. Its highlight is a series of drawings and photographs by Frederick Kiesler, the Austrian-American polymath whose Endless House  never completed  fused fine art, architecture, furniture and lighting design into a bulbous, unstable whole. Several artists here echo Kieslers theme of the house as a reflection of the psychology of its inhabitants. None is more powerful than Rachel Whitereads sober image, made with white correction fluid, of a dwelling in East London: a preparatory drawing for a now lost sculpture crafted by filling the house with liquid concrete. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Jason Farago) Museum of Modern Art: Jackson Pollock: A Collection Survey, 1934-1954 (through May 1) The first exhibition devoted to the Moderns unsurpassed Pollock holding gives a dazzling account of the evolution of his signature poured paintings. Its 58 works on canvas and paper also attest to the Moderns laserlike focus on accounting fully for the achievements of artists it deems great. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith) Museum of Modern Art: Joaqun Torres-Garca: The Arcadian Modern (through Feb. 15) Few artists can claim to have captured a revolution in thinking in a single image, but Joaqun Torres-Garca did. In 1934, Torres-Garcia (1874-1949) took a hard-won knowledge of European modernism from Paris back to his birthplace of Uruguay. He gave the transplanted movement a name  The School of the South  and designed for it a now-famous logo: the silhouette of the South American continent turned upside down and placed above the Tropic of Cancer, where North America was on conventional maps. And he explained the meaning: The South, as a font of creative energy, was the new North, or at least its equal. The image, and the spirit that produced it, can be found in MoMAs career survey, the artists first major United States retrospective in four decades. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)Museum of Modern Art: Ocean of Images: New Photography 2015 (through March 20) To celebrate the 30th anniversary of its longstanding New Photography series, and perhaps to soften the news that the series will now change from annual to biennial, MoMA presents the largest and most cosmopolitan edition yet, with 19 artists and collectives, from 14 countries. The title refers to the infinite image blank called the Internet, and borrowed and manipulated images. So built-in delays in accessibility. Almost wherever you look you need to look twice, and consult a label, to fully understand what youre seeing. The extra effort feels more fruitful in some cases than in others, with work by Yuki Kimura, Basim Magdy, Indre Serpytyte and Lieko Shiga particular worth lingering over. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)Museum of Modern Art: Scenes for a New Heritage: Contemporary Art from the Collection (through April 10) MoMAs latest installation of works from its permanent collection fills the second-floor contemporary galleries with videos, installations, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs produced by more than 30 artists during the past three decades. Its an uneven, haphazard selection, but leaving artistic quality aside, its unusually optimistic-sounding title inadvertently raises a large and intriguing question: At a time when contemporary art seems to be spinning its wheels, what could a new heritage be? 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson) Museum of Modern Art: Soldier, Spectre, Shaman: The Figure and the Second World War (through March 20) MoMA usually stages the years after 1945 as a triumph of American abstraction, but this vital show affirms that the human figure never disappeared from art  especially not in battle-scarred Europe. With the end of the war, and the full revelation of the Holocaust, the human body became a sign of pathos and existential dread, notably in the fraught paintings of Francis Bacon and the spindly sculptures of Alberto Giacometti. The same was true of other European artists who received less American acclaim  such as Jean Fautrier, whose haunted Otages (Hostages) are far better known in his native France. The show is drawn entirely from the museums permanent collection, and its greatest surprise comes from Jan Mller, a German migr in New York, whose ghoulish Faust I (1956) depicts the witches of Goethes epic as starved, traumatized wraiths. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Jason Farago) Museum of Modern Art: Take an Object (through Feb. 28) Installed next to the Moderns Jackson Pollock exhibition, this show of 37 works from 1954 to the 1970s reflects how the finality of the Abstract Expressionists drip paintings deflected many artists from the medium toward found objects and a greater worldliness. Its title is from a famous notebook entry by Jasper Johns. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)Museum of the City of New York: Activist New York (continuing) With a focus on activist tactics from the 17th century to the present, this exhibition  designed by the firm Pentagram  is a room-size onslaught of sensory stimulation, complete with videos, graphics and text. Told through 14 moments in New York activism, it includes a facsimile of the Flushing Remonstrance (1657), a petition for religious tolerance given to Peter Stuyvesant, director-general of the settlement, as well as contemporaneous objects, like a Dutch tobacco box, a Bible and Meet the Activists kiosks adjacent to each display, which identify activist groups working in the present. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Schwendener)Museum of the City of New York: Jacob A. Riis: Revealing New Yorks Other Half (through March 20) The Danish immigrant muckrakers stark photographs, coupled with his documents from the New York Public Library and the Library of Congress, vividly portray the changing face of poverty since Riis exposed the poor to an oblivious public 125 years ago and remind viewers of the lingering challenges. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Sam Roberts)New-York Historical Society: Maest': Gaddis Triptych Reunited (through March 20) This tiny but lovely exhibition focuses on three marvelous Italian Early Renaissance paintings from a collection given to the society by Thomas Jefferson Bryan, one of most discerning American collectors of the 19th century. The main attraction, by Taddeo Gaddi, is a triptych whose central panel depicting Mary enthroned  the Maest  here is temporarily reunited with the folding shutters from which it had been separated long ago. The two other paintings are a poignant Crucifixion by a follower of Duccio di Buoninsegna and a lively, panoramic picture of an Ancient Roman procession by Giovanni di Ser Giovanni Guidi, Masaccios younger brother. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)Studio Museum in Harlem: A Constellation, Black: Color, Material, Concept, Lorraine OGrady: Art Is ' and Marc Andre Robinson: Twice Told (through March 6) A Constellation, includes the work of 26 artists and focuses on themes of abstraction, the figure and the history of the African diaspora. Black: Color, Material, Concept continues the conversation around blackness initiated by Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of the museum, who introduced the term post-black into the cultural conversation almost 15 years ago with the exhibition Freestyle. In the basement, a sculptural installation by Marc Andre Robinson weaves together formalism with black cultural history, while another, Lorraine OGrady: Art Is   offers a fantastic exhibition of photographs documenting Ms. OGradys performance piece during Harlems 1983 African-American Day Parade, in which she skillfully weaves together art, activism and participation. 144 West 125th Street, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener) Whitney Museum of American Art: Collected by Thea Westreich Wagner and Ethan Wagner (through March 6) Two of New Yorks most dedicated explorers of new art set an important example by refusing the auction or private-museum route and giving almost all of their large collection to a museum. Their generous gift both signifies and adds to the Whitneys growing stature, especially going forward, as it is integrated into the museums rich holdings. This first sampling is quite rewarding. 99 Gansevoort Street, at Washington Street, 212-570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)Whitney Museum of American Art: Flatlands (through April 17) This engaging small show presents a dozen pieces by five young (all born since 1980) representational painters who work under the influences of Pop Art and Surrealism. Highlights include Matthew Cerlettys hallucinogenic view into a fish tank; Orion Martins erotic depiction of a knee-high boot; Jamian Juliano-Villanis funny-scary image of an apartment haunted by a black-clad figure with an animal-skull head; Caitlin Keoghs anatomical meditations resembling pages from a morbid coloring book for grown-ups; and Nina Chanel Abneys 18-foot-wide Hothouse, which updates Picassos Les Demoiselles dAvignon. 99 Gansevoort Street, at Washington Street, 212-570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson) Swedish Wooden Toys (through Feb. 28) This presentation of more than 300 playthings from the late 16th to the early 21st centuries will be catnip for anyone into antique toys. The show features diminutive vehicles of all kinds from old-time wagons, trains and fully-rigged sailboats, to futuristic cars and a rocket ship. There are naturalistic and anthropomorphic animals, weapons, puzzles, games, dollhouses and architectural construction kits. While many of these items were produced by big manufacturers like BRIO and Playsam, many others are one-of-a-kind wonders like a miniature baking set from around 1900 that includes rolling pins, spatulas and other implements all lovingly carved from wood and fitting into a tray just eight inches long. Bard Graduate Center Gallery, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, 212-501-3011, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)Sally Michel (through Feb. 13) The wife of the American painter Milton Avery was a painter in her own right, while working full time to support him. This affecting exhibition, primarily of landscapes from the 1950s, shows that she was influenced by his pared-down style, but found her own way with richer colors, rougher textures, smaller size and greater emotional intensity. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, 212-581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith) Concrete Cuba (through Feb. 20) The history of postwar abstraction expands with this riveting exhibition of nearly 40 works. All were made in Cuba during the 1950s by a group called Los Diez Pintores Concretos  the 10 Concrete Painters. Working small, they fruitfully extended the geometric vocabularies of Constructivism, Mondrian and late Kandinsky with local colors and repurposed materials. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 212-517-8677, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)Ann Veronica Janssens (through Feb. 20) This Brussels-based British artist extends yet shows up the tradition of Southern Californias Light and Space movement. Mainly her strict yet playful economy of means avoids the usual fuss  built-out environments, computerized light shows and removal of footwear  that belies the movements less-is-more, dematerialized aesthetic. The results are as beautiful and more thought-provoking. Bortolami Gallery, 520 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 212-727-2050, bortolamigallery.com. (Smith) Jonathan Lasker (through Feb. 13) In the 1980s, Jonathan Lasker minted a type of postmodern Pop abstraction that slyly parodied Modernist formalism. This terrific show finds the painter still relying fruitfully on his signature vocabulary of generic forms: grids, squiggly snarls, patterns of loosely knit lines, absurdly thick lines in primary colors and black areas painted with wide brushes. Mr. Lasker combines these into punchy, cartoonlike compositions in which paint itself seems animated by an exuberant life of its own. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-7727, cheimread.com. (Johnson)Robert Melee: Semi-Quasi-Bower Recreational (through Feb. 13) Robert Melees current show perfectly fits the criterion Susan Sontag once prescribed for camp: as a vision of the world in terms of style resulting in a good taste of bad taste  although this is camp for the Gallery Age of white cube spaces and glittering objects. Photomontages of casinos in Atlantic City have chandeliers jammed laterally into them. The pice de rsistance is Bower Pool (2016), an aboveground pool hung upside down from the ceiling, emitting a cascade of streamers, lights and confetti; its reminiscent of the nooks in nightclubs where acts of debauchery are performed  although none are likely to take place here. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Schwendener) Robert Ryman (through June 18) For nearly 60 years, the Minimalist painter Robert Ryman has had few equals when it comes to doing more with less. White has been his primary, if not quite his only, color, the square his typical format. And yet within these seeming limitations a remarkably fecund and resonant body of work has evolved as demonstrated with unusual clarity (and in natural light) by this small but comprehensive exhibition. Dia: Chelsea, 535 West 22nd Street, 212-989-5566, diaart.org. (Smith) Giorgio Morandi (through June 25) The Italian master of modern still life, and closet abstractionist, is celebrated in a large show devoted foremost to his painting from the 1930s, which are not well known in this country. They reveal a period of struggle during which the artist had settled on what to paint, how to paint was still very much up for grabs. Joel Meyerowitzs large color photographs of Morandis still life objects  which he sometimes altered  are also on view. Reservations are required. Center for Italian Modern Art, 421 Broome Street, near Crosby Street, SoHo, 646-370-3596, italianmodernart.org. (Smith) Cameron Rowland: 91020000 (through March 13) This remarkable show fuses history and aesthetics using carefully selected (and displayed) found objects accompanied by terse, illuminating captions. The subject is slavery as the primary through-line of the American saga, from the Middle Passage beyond the Emancipation Proclamation and into the present in the form of cheap inmate labor in state prisons, where the population is one-third African-American. It is a shameful, heartbreaking story and a continuing plague on the national house. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Smith) Global/Local 19602015: Six Artists from Iran (through April 2) In the early 1960s, the American art patron Abby Weed Grey traveled to Iran, loved the new art she saw there, bought it and gave it to New York University, where she also founded Grey Art Gallery. For its current multigenerational show, the gallery joins two artists from its collection, Parviz Tanavoli and Faramarz Pilaram, with borrowed work by four younger figures. Of particular interest is an installation by Chohreh Feyzdjou (1955-1996) who, late in her career, recycled her only earlier paintings in installations that suggest the contents of pharaonic tombs. She is well matched in the young Tehran Conceptualist Barbad Golshiri, who takes funerary monuments and history as his theme. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Cotter) Glenn Ligon: We Need to Wake Up Cause Thats What Time It Is (through April 17) At some point in the 1982 film Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip, the politically trenchant comedian says that racism makes him so furious he cant speak. Silence is the most immediately arresting feature of Mr. Ligons installation, for which the soundtrack of the film has been eliminated. Whats left is an entirely visual experience, and a radically fragmented one, projected on several screens ranged around the gallery. On one, Mr. Pryor appears, full length, on stage; On the others, hes divided into close-ups: his mouth on one screen, his hands on another; his torso and groin isolated on a third; his shadow, cast by the spotlight on yet another. Luhring Augustine Bushwick, 25 Knickerbocker Avenue, at Ingraham Street, Brooklyn, 718-386-2746, luhringaugustine.com. (Cotter) Painting Tranquility: Masterworks by Vilhelm Hammershoi From SMK  The National Gallery of Denmark (through Feb. 27) One of Denmarks most celebrated artists, Hammershoi (1864-1916) was known as the painter of tranquil rooms. This beautiful show of 24 paintings includes pictures in severely muted colors of women in nearly empty rooms suffused by atmospheres of mystery and loneliness; misty, gray cityscapes, devoid of people, that are like anxiety dreams; and tenderly unflinching portraits of the artists wife, Ida. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)Urban Zellweger: Tables and Landscapes (through Feb. 14) This young Swiss artist paints goofy, enigmatic images with a deft cartoon-Expressionist touch. Four of the shows six paintings represent composite figures with the bodies of quadrupeds awkwardly conjoined to human torsos. In one, a headless person sitting at a table in a depressing, bare room is connected at the neck and shoulder to the headless body of a dog. Its appropriately titled Dog Day. Shoot the Lobster, 138 Eldridge Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, 212-560-0670, shootthelobster.com. (Johnson)Jeppe Hein: Please Touch the Art (through April 17) People with small children likely will enjoy Mr. Heins three-part show. If its a hot day, the kids will rush to be drenched by Appearing Rooms, which has water spouting up unpredictably from a square platform of metal grating. Youngsters as well as grown-ups also may be fascinating by the perceptually confounding Mirror Labyrinth NY, which consists of mirror-surfaced planks of stainless steel in varying heights planted in the grass in a spiral formation. Meanwhile, guardians can rest on one of 16 fanciful, shocking orange park benches while their young charges clamber about on the furnitures surrealistically altered parts. Brooklyn Bridge Park, 334 Furman Street, Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn, publicartfund.org. (Johnson)Dia:Beacon: Robert Irwin: Excursus: Homage to the Square' (through May 2017) A walk-in maze with walls of white scrim lit by color-filtered fluorescent tubes, Mr. Irwins Excursus: Homage to the Square had its debut in 1998 at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea. It was so popular that the curators elected to keep it on view a year longer than its originally planned run. Its reincarnation here is similarly transporting, if not as thoroughly as the original was. But to experience it at Dia:Beacon along Minimalist works by other artists that encourage heightened perceptual attention to the here and now is as spiritually calming as it is historically illuminating. 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, 845-440-0100, diaart.org. (Johnson) Museum of Fine Arts Boston: Made in the Americas: The New World Discovers Asia (through Feb. 15) One of the great gifts that multiculturalist thinking gave us was freedom from the tyranny of purity. Simply put, theres no such thing, at least not in art. Everything is a mix, and this has always been true. Globalism, which we take to be so 21st century, is as old as the hills. In this smallish show those hills encompass the Andes, the Alps, the Appalachians and Mount Fuji between the early 16th to the late 18th century. The main setting includes large swaths of North, Central and South America being colonized by various European powers, all of which had lucrative commercial links to Asia, and they were bringing Asia with them to the New World. The result: some of the most brilliant American art ever. 465 Huntington Avenue, Boston, 617-267-9300, mfa.org. (Cotter) National Gallery of Art: Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World (through March 20) One of the best sculpture surveys youll ever see, this one refutes the view that Hellenistic period was inferior to the idealized renderings of the Classical age. Its 40 outstanding figures and heads trace the introduction of an unprecedented realism visible in a combination of motion, emotion and physical detail that can still astound. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 202-737-4215, nga.gov. (Smith)Dana DeGiulio and Molly Zuckerman-Hartung: Queen (closes on Sunday) Two painters, long based in Chicago, have moved to New York, and their joint exhibition at Lyles & King is a dramatic statement signaling their arrival. Ms. DeGiulios paintings take a simple trope, the floral still life, and remake it into a black-and-white postpunk-type affair. Ms. Zuckerman-Hartungs work is a firestorm of techniques and effects: bleaching, dyeing, staining and sewing linen, silk and humble dropcloths. Throughout the show, the message is clear: Everything matters. Marks matter, titles matter and gestures matter. 106 Forsyth Street, at Broome Street, Lower East Side, 646-484-5478, lylesandking.com. (Schwendener) Coco Fusco (closes on Saturday) This engrossing show is the New York debut of Coco Fuscos 2015 film La Confesin, about the public admission of counterrevolutionary activity made in 1971 in Cuba by the poet Heberto Padilla, after he had spent weeks in prison. His confession provided the pretext for a campaign of widespread literary censorship, documented here in a display of government memos recently found by the historian Lillian Guerra in the archives of the Cuban Ministry of Culture. The show includes seven more of Ms. Fuscos films, including one on the dissident poet Mara Elena Cruz Valera. The longer you spend with Ms. Fuscos work, the deeper it gets. Alexander Gray Associates, 510 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-399-2636, alexandergray.com. (Cotter) Ilse DHollander (closes on Saturday) This generous exhibition introduces the work of a Belgian painter who committed suicide in 1997 at the age of 29. The paintings here, made mostly in 1995 and 96, are small, pale and intelligent. They share some common ground with Belgian painters like Raoul de Keyser and Luc Tuymans, but their softened geometries are more open, accommodating suggestions of landscape, seashore and weather as well as abstraction. Her art, at least, was in a very good place. Sean Kelly Gallery, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-239-1181, skny.com. (Smith) Jewish Museum: The Power of Pictures: Early Soviet Photography, Early Soviet Film (closes on Sunday) Revolutions sell utopias; thats their job. Art, if it behaves itself and sticks to the right script, can be an important part of the promotional package. Thats the basic tale told by this exhibition of photographs and vintage films of the 1920s and 30s, but with a question added: What happens to art when the script is drastically revised? Russia was an experiment in progress in the heady years following the 1917 revolution, and avant-garde art, free-spirited by definition, was officially embraced. When Joseph Stalin came to power art became government-dictated propaganda and its makers, often under threat, towed the line. Remarkably, the show presents a dozen films  some familiar, some not  full-length, on a rotating schedule of four a day, in a small viewing theater built into one of the museums galleries. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)Sarah Meyohas (closes on Saturday) This exhibitions 10 white canvases with black lines scrawled across them are not examples of Minimalist Expressionism. Rather, they represent a 10-day performance by Ms. Meyohas, now completed, in which she traded stocks of 10 different companies on the New York Stock Exchange from her laptop in the gallery and then drew lines on the canvases mimicking the graphed price lines of each trading session. The paintings arent much to look at, but theyre exceptionally interesting to think about. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)The Missing: Rebuilding the Past (closes on Friday) The Anya and Andrew Shiva Gallery at John Jay College of Criminal Justice is always worth keeping an eye on. Its current group show was inspired by the continuing destruction of antiquities in Iraq and Syria by ISIS and was conceived as an alarm, a protest and a symbolic form of restitution. Works by seven artists refer to campaigns of cultural obliteration present and past. A catalog essay by the curators, Erin Thompson and Thalia Vrachopoulos, addresses the positive and negative impact of digital technology on archaeological preservation. 860 11th Avenue, at 59th Street, Clinton, 212-237-1439, shivagallery.org. (Cotter) Museum of Modern Art: Picasso Sculpture (closes on Sunday) Nearly a work of art in its own right, this magnificent show redefines Picassos achievement with the first full view here in 50 years of his astoundingly varied forays into sculpture. His materials, not his female loves, become the muses, and are different each time out. The basic plotline: After introducing sculptural abstraction and space, he spent about 50 years counting the ways that the figure was far from finished. (Open until midnight on Saturday and Sunday.) 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) Hans Schrer: Madonnas and Erotic Watercolors (closes on Sunday) One of Switzerlands most celebrated artists, Hans Schrer (19271997) created paintings that look as if made by a self-taught psychiatric patient. This delightful show presents two bodies of work created between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s. In the main gallery are 41 portraits of the biblical Mary, each called Madonna. On the mezzanine level are 87 watercolors: cartoon images of voluptuous women cheerfully engaging in all kinds of sexual activities often involving runty, priapic male figures and sometimes priests. Swiss Institute Contemporary Art, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, 212-925-2035, swissinstitute.net. (Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: Frank Stella: A Retrospective (closes on Sunday) This grand, high-spirited, slightly overstuffed exhibition pays overdue tribute to a prominent American artist whose 60-year odyssey through and beyond painting began in this city. It further anoints the Whitneys new building: The show could never have been pulled off at its old uptown address. And its ingenious installation  alternately dazzling, oppressive and nuts  resounds with stimulating clashes of color, style and process that bring a new unity to his contentious achievement. 99 Gansevoort Street, at Washington Street, 212-570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) Martin Wong: Voices (closes on Saturday) This excellent exhibition complements the Bronx Museum of Arts current retrospective of Wongs poignant, street-wise Magic Realist paintings and is nearly equal in size and substance. Organized from the artists estate by Anneliis Beadnell and Dino Dincer Sirin, it includes art-school ceramics and early paintings full of promise, dazzling quick sketches, poems written in a spiky calligraphy on hanging scrolls and late paintings that point Magic Realism in a new direction. P.P.O.W., 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-647-1044, ppowgallery.com. (Smith)Ray Yoshida: Mystery and Wit (closes on Saturday) Ray Yoshidas reputation has been somewhat submerged in the waves of attention surrounding other painters known as the Chicago Imagists and the Hairy Who, many of whom were his students in the 1960s and 70s at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. But in this solo show, Mr. Yoshida, who died in 2009, more than holds his own  in paintings and drawings that combine Pop, Expressionism and folk-art styles, with a dollop of abstraction and mastery of an unusual medium, the felt-tipped pen.

{"text": "Bill de Blasio has promised to undo one of historys great blunders.And, by the way, it is not one that the mayor made himself.Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that he planned to build a new streetcar line along the waterfront from Brooklyn to Queens, a stretch of real estate that now commands stupefying prices but offers almost no public transit options. Not everybody rides bicycles, observed Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor.Of course, streetcars would aid and abet the rampage of gentrification.But they would also provide a chance at decent transit for more than 40,000 people who live in New York City housing projects that were built along the waterfront in the 1940s and 50s, when the area was an industrial zone that was about to die. There were many streetcar lines around there that got torn up around the time to be replaced by buses, said Harris Schechtman, who for many years was the general manager of the city bus system.So many trolleys ran through the streets of Brooklyn that the nimble natives who became adept at getting out of their way, the dodgers of Brooklyn, inspired the name of a certain baseball team.Until the late 1940s, trains and trolleys carried 400,000 people a day across the Brooklyn Bridge. Then a master plan was carried out: Tear up the tracks and make more room on the bridge for cars.The 400,000 people in trains and trolleys became 170,000 in cars, according to Sam Schwartz, a transportation planner and the author of Street Smart: The Rise of Cities and the Fall of Cars.That was such a stupid thing to do, Mr. Schwartz said.It was stupid by design, a plank in the 1942 Regional Plan issued by the Regional Plan Association. The streetcar industry was killed off in most cities in the country by the middle of the 20th century, unable to survive a hostile economic climate, including the emergence of suburbs, or a criminal conspiracy by manufacturers of buses, tires and petroleum products to encourage 45 cities in 16 states to remove older street transit systems and replace them with their products.The last streetcar in New York City ran across the Queensboro Bridge on April 7, 1957.Nearly 59 years later, the city and times have changed so drastically that Mr. de Blasio is prepared to build a 16-mile route from Sunset Park in Brooklyn to Astoria in Queens. A feasibility study, which both Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Schechtman worked on, was paid for by real estate interests, including the Durst family, which has property in Astoria, and the Walentas family, which has developments in Brooklyn.How would the line be paid for?It would increase the property values along its route, and the increase in property taxes over time would amount to $4 billion, Mr. Schechtman said. The cost of the line is currently put at $2.5 billion. As an example, Mr. de Blasio points to the extension of the No. 7 line to the Far West Side of Manhattan, where it will serve developments over train yards. Under his predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the cost of extending the train was to be put entirely on the increased property values, but so far, the city has had to kick in $367 million in debt service on the bonds for that project, according to the citys Independent Budget Office.Perhaps the streetcar line would not be in perfect economic equilibrium, but it would make it possible for more people to live along the waterfront. Mass transit works like irrigation for skyscrapers and housing.The new streetcars would each carry 150 to 175 people, Mr. Schwartz said. The articulated buses that now run in parts of the city have room for about 100 passengers. The study had considered using the extended buses in dedicated lanes, known as Bus Rapid Transit, but Mr. Schwartz said those buses required more space, particularly when they turn.Who would build and run a streetcar line? The Schwartz team recommends that a single company design, build and operate the system. With one company in charge, Mr. Schwartz said, theres no value in stalling construction.The city has grown by more than a million people in the last two decades; if is to continue to grow, it needs more housing and more transit. Low-income people who live here now already face commutes of up to an hour.People say, Arent you just serving the upper-middle class of hipsters?  Mr. Schwartz said. It turns out were also serving a huge number of people who live in housing projects."}
{"text": "The firefly is very lonely. The caterpillar is very hungry. The sea horse is very swollen. (He happens to be, if youll pardon the expression, very pregnant.) But the children? Theyre just very happy.All occupy the 47th Street Theater, where The Very Hungry Caterpillar Show, now in previews, opens on Sunday. Many families will recognize its ravenous title character as the invention of Eric Carle, the award-winning author and illustrator.Created by Jonathan Rockefeller, this Australian production, which will mesmerize audience members as young as 2, doesnt so much adapt four of Mr. Carles picture books as animate them. You could swear that the stories creatures, in their authors signature style of hand-painted tissue paper collage, had stretched, stood up, shaken themselves and lumbered, leapt, sailed or flown off the page and onto Raul Abregos deceptively simple, multipaneled set.Designed by Eric Wright and executed by the Puppet Kitchen, these beasts range from glowing fireflies, mounted on rods and held aloft, to a jointed, life-size polka-dot donkey that dances a hoedown with Weston Long, a puppeteer whos a stand-in for Mr. Carle. (Nate Edmondson composed the background music, which ranges from sweetly lyrical to comically percussive.)The books, recited verbatim by cast members (above from left, Ariel Lauryn, Kayla Prestel and Jake Bazel), all deal with journeys, emotional or physical. They start with The Artist Who Painted a Blue Horse (2011), simultaneously a biographical tribute to Franz Marc, a German Expressionist who inspired Mr. Carle, and an autobiographical voyage through his own imagination.Children, however, will experience it just as a straightforward tale of a painter who creates a fantastically colored menagerie  a yellow cow, a pink rabbit, a purple fox  which the show brings to life both two-dimensionally, on easels, and three-dimensionally, as ever more varied surprises. (Keep an eye on those onstage windows.)Then its on to Mister Seahorse (2004), which charmingly pays homage to fathers. The title character, en route to giving birth, passes a host of other committed aquatic dads. From the ocean, the show shifts to the sky, where the hero of The Very Lonely Firefly (1995) seeks fellowship, mistakenly flying to many other forms of illumination before finding its own kind.The show saves The Very Hungry Caterpillar (1969) for last, and its not hard to guess how his adventure ends. Like Mr. Carle, he proves to be a master of artful transformation, beginning with the simple only to arrive at the bedazzling.(Through March 27 at 304 West 47th Street, Manhattan, hungrycaterpillarshow.com, 212-279-4200.

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing Middle Eastern artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (around 1900) where young archaeologists can dress in costume and portray early-20th-century immigrants to Palestine. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.Bird-Watching Central Park Hike (Saturday) When children approach middle-school age, Mom and Dad usually drop to the bottom of the list of socially desirable companions. The company B2 Events NYC tries to counteract that trend with one-time activities that are captivating enough that 8- to 13-year-olds will be willing  even enthusiastic  to do them in parent-child pairs. The latest is this outing in Central Park, rescheduled after being snowed out on Jan. 23.

That would include traders who use lightning-fast computer systems and software to profit from small movements in stock prices.They would be subject to the new rules starting in September.The new measures, part of a broader certification program in Britain, would require firms to assess the fitness of people to serve in those positions; the firms would ultimately be accountable to regulators if they are not.We are determined to embed a culture of personal responsibility within the banking sector, Tracey McDermott, the acting chief executive of the authority, said in a news release.Clear individual accountability should focus minds, drive up standards, and make firms easier to run and to supervise, she added. And if things go wrong, it will allow senior managers to be held to account for misconduct that falls within their area of responsibility.The Financial Conduct Authority said in July that it was considering adding wholesale traders to its certification rules.The certification regime is one of several changes taken by the agency and other regulators here to discourage undue risk-taking and to bring more accountability to the financial industry.The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, a financial regulator within the Bank of England, have put in place a series of measures to make top executives and managers at banks operating in Britain more accountable for financial failings and misconduct that could play a role in precipitating future financial upheavals.That includes new rules that would allow bonuses for senior managers and certain risk-takers at financial companies to be clawed back for up to a decade in the event of misconduct.Regulators have also introduced new rules to establish a basic standard for behavior for workers at regulated firms.Both sets of new measures will go into effect in March."}
{"text": "So, do you remember this? Romney vows to lower unemployment rate to 6 percent by end of first term.Ahem:But everyone makes bad forecasts; Republicans are still going on about the over-optimism of the Romer-Bernstein forecast of early 2009, insisting that it proves that the stimulus was a failure. So is making fun of Mitt Romney anything more than a case of turnabout being fair play?Actually, yes.The big problem with Romer-Bernstein was not that they over-estimated the effectiveness of fiscal policy. In fact, their assumed multiplier of 1.5 still looks very good in the light of subsequent research and events. For example, the euro area carried out a sort of natural experiment from 2009 to 2013, in which some but not all countries were forced into drastic austerity policies. If we plot the change in structural budget surpluses as a share of GDP against GDP growth, we get this:And a regression finds a multiplier of, um, 1.53. Similar numbers come out of a variety of approaches. So the analytics of Romer-Bernstein on policy look quite good; their mistake was to underestimate the damage the financial crisis would do.Republican predictions of Obamadoom, on the other hand, were all about their claims about policy effects: the 2013 tax hike and the coming of Obamacare would be massive job-killers, they insisted again and again. So good employment performance really does count as a major disproof of their worldview.Or to take a cheaper but still fair shot: imagine what they would be saying if Romney actually were president, and we had this jobs record."}

{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Frustrated and flailing as his candidacy threatens to slip away, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is embarking on a scalding effort over the next week to discredit Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the man he blames for undermining his campaign and whose ascendancy he deeply resents.And Mr. Christie has a secret ally: Jeb Bush.Mr. Christie, whose White House hopes hinge on a strong showing in New Hampshire, is unleashing the kind of cutting and personal attacks that brought him renown in New Jersey but that pose a far greater risk in a presidential campaign, where they can harm the assailant as much as the intended target.Over the past 48 hours, Mr. Christie has mocked Mr. Rubio as a cosseted boy in the bubble, derided him as constantly scripted, likened him to the king of England, and, perhaps most creatively, compared his Senate career to that of a helpless fourth grader who is told which chair to sit in at school.On Wednesday, Mr. Christie challenged anyone to show me the significant accomplishment that Senator Rubio has done while hes in the United States Senate.I cant find one, Mr. Christie added.For Mr. Christie, the verbal barrage is a carefully calibrated attempt to damage Mr. Rubios standing in New Hampshire before Tuesdays primary  and to set up a showdown with him in Saturday nights Republican debate, possibly Mr. Christies best chance to impede Mr. Rubios surging candidacy.Mr. Rubios strong third-place performance in Iowa on Monday night, and his steady improvement in the polls days before the voting there, alarmed Mr. Christie and his mainstream Republican rivals, including Mr. Bush, who fear Mr. Rubios emerging as a breakout figure in New Hampshire.The shared concern has even prompted the opening of a back channel: Members of the Bush and Christie campaigns have communicated about their mutual desire to halt Mr. Rubios rise in the polls, according to Republican operatives familiar with the conversations.While emails, texts and phone calls between operatives in rival campaigns are not uncommon in the tight-knit world of political strategists, the contact among senior aides in the two campaigns has drifted toward musings about what can be done to stop or at least slow Mr. Rubio, the operatives said.In a sign of a budding alliance, the aides have, for example, exchanged news articles that raise potential areas of vulnerability for Mr. Rubio. There is no formal coordination, the operatives stressed, but rather a recognition of a shared agenda. We do have similar goals, an adviser to Mr. Christie said.For their part, Mr. Christie and Mr. Bush are praising each other in public and cozying up to each other in private: Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Christie on Monday to wish him good luck in the caucuses. (Mr. Christie was not available, and the call went to voice mail.)During a CNN interview Wednesday, Mr. Bush put their bond on display for all to see. I love Chris Christie, said Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida. He is a  hes a great campaigner, hes a good friend and hes been an effective governor.A division of labor seems to have taken hold. While a well-financed super PAC supporting Mr. Bush assails Mr. Rubio on television and in the mail, Mr. Christie has increased the critiques on the campaign trail.Jeb cant do that sort of stuff, said an adviser to Mr. Christie, referring to the New Jersey governors slashing boy in the bubble attack on Mr. Rubio and his comfort with political street fighting. They dont have the weapon.The alliance makes sense, operatives said. A strong primary night in New Hampshire for Mr. Rubio would allow him to make a compelling case to voters and donors that he is the surest bet for unifying the party against its most divisive presidential contenders, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.And it would make it harder for Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie to justify remaining in the race.As the primary nears, Mr. Christie is expressing disapproval for Mr. Rubio in increasingly elaborate and colorful ways.At Londonderry High School, he found a fourth grader named Matthew in the audience and posed a series of questions about his daily routine.Did he have a set time when he had to be at school? Yes, the boy said.An assigned desk to sit in? The boy nodded.A list of questions to answer each day  and a summer break? Matthew answered affirmatively.Mr. Christie pounced: They do that in the United States Senate, too! The audience roared.The Senate, he said, was a foolhardy place from which to pick a president. What we are all wondering is: How does that train you to be president? Mr. Christie said. Because thats not the way the presidency works, and it is certainly not the way the governorship works.Speaking to reporters in Manchester on Thursday, Mr. Rubio said that the joint attacks from his rivals were silly.Look, when people are having a tough time in a campaign, especially near the end, you see some desperation set in and so theyll start saying things. But Im not too worried about that.Joe Pounder, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, also dismissed the criticism, pointing to a record that he suggested was outside the Republican mainstream.No amount of hot air or made-up facts can distract from Chris Christies liberal record, he said.For Mr. Christie, there is a personal dimension to the onslaught against Mr. Rubio.After Mr. Christie started to gain in the polls in New Hampshire late last year, allies of Mr. Rubio paid for a ferocious series of television advertisements and direct-mail pieces attacking the New Jersey governor for deviations from conservative orthodoxy and over the gridlock-creating lane closures near the George Washington Bridge overseen by his allies. In a final flourish, they showed images of Mr. Christie together with President Obama, evoking a divisive moment after Hurricane Sandy when the governor praised and warmly greeted the president.Beyond that, Mr. Christie evidently feels a sense of betrayal over the inroads that Mr. Rubio has made with major Republican donors, particularly the New York-area financiers whom Mr. Christie spent years courting.So he got a couple of donors, Mr. Christie sniffed, adding, Good for him."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.   David Carney, a veteran Republican strategist here, has received six phone calls at his Hancock, N.H., home from Donald J. Trumps campaign the last few days. But five came after the Trump volunteers were told that the occupants were backing another candidate: Mr. Carneys wife is Carly Fiorinas campaign director in the state.For Mr. Carney, who has often praised Mr. Trumps message, the wayward calls signaled impressive grass-roots enthusiasm. But they were also a telltale sign of strategic rudderlessness.They have a lot of volunteers and theyre proud about that, but volunteers is not a ground game, said Mr. Carney, who was the top strategist for Rick Perrys 2012 presidential race and has been deeply involved in studies of how campaigns use information about voters. Theyre basically just picking up the phone book.Discerning the strength of any candidates ground game can be difficult. Mr. Trump has one key ingredient: an army of volunteers drawn to him by his popularity and his message. But precision counts, as Iowa demonstrated. And what Mr. Trump appears to lack is what could provide that precision: a direct-mail program, a comprehensive targeting effort to identify his supporters and their intensity, and a dedicated pollster to help pinpoint the voters to whom his television ads might appeal.Until this week, Mr. Trumps campaign projected enormous confidence in its get-out-the-vote abilities, predicting it would pull out a victory in Iowa and then blow away the competition in New Hampshire. But his aides shrouded their efforts in mystery, vaguely predicting an impressive result.His not-so-narrow loss to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in Mondays caucuses, however, immediately raised the stakes in New Hampshire and has aimed a spotlight on Mr. Trumps efforts to identify, organize and turn out supporters in the primary on Tuesday. In revealing remarks, Mr. Trump publicly questioned his campaigns efforts in Iowa, where he was out-hustled by the data-driven Cruz campaign. He blamed his team for not spending more money, and even said that he had not known what a ground game was before Iowa.Now, Mr. Trump, who has boasted about spending so little on his campaign, must harness his supporters enthusiasm in New Hampshire, a state where, in such a crowded race against organized opponents, a good field organization might be crucial.The question is how much better the turnout operation will be in New Hampshire. Three people briefed on internal discussions in the campaign said that repeated requests from employees in early nominating states for a greater focus on analyzing data had gone unanswered. And though the campaign started to put together a data operation last fall, it has had no direct mail effort  a fixture of Republican primary campaigns in New Hampshire.Asked about those accounts, Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trumps campaign manager, insisted they were untrue. I know the budget process at the campaign, and I cant think of three people who would have knowledge of the decision rights for this type of transaction, he said in an interview. Trump has never said no to a funding request.Mr. Lewandowski, a longtime New Hampshire resident who oversaw the Iowa turnout operation but has an even firmer grip on it here, said he did not see the caucus defeat as indicative of larger organizational problems.They are two very different states, he said. I think the state of Iowa is a state that was tailor-made for Ted Cruz, and our candidate has been in politics for exactly six months and came away with a second-place victory. And were proud of that.Mr. Lewandowski said that the campaign was using detailed consumer data to build lists of potential New Hampshire supporters, but that the campaign, in something of a departure, was not narrowly focused on the most habitual voters.The people that we traditionally talk to are the ones who have been disenfranchised, or maybe they are the old Reagan Democrats, he said. Were looking at those individuals who may not have been the traditional Republicans.That includes independents, who can vote in either partys primary, as well as registered Republicans who have not voted in the last four elections, he said.If Mr. Trump has an ace in the hole in New Hampshire, it is Mr. Lewandowski, a wiry figure with a buzz-cut, an earpiece and a Secret Service pin. He previously worked for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.The highest-profile race Mr. Lewandowski, a native of nearby Lowell, Mass., has run before was the 2002 re-election campaign of Senator Robert C. Smith, who lost in the Republican primary to Representative John E. Sununu, a favorite of mainstream party leaders. Mr. Lewandowski has been more or less denouncing the states Republican establishment ever since.Mr. Trumps basic message, raising the alarm about national security and immigration, has played quite well in New Hampshire. And with a primary election a relatively simple proposition  the most votes wins  compared with a caucus, Mr. Trump may not need to rely so heavily on organization. The New Hampshire primary tends to be driven more by news media coverage, and Mr. Trumps popularity, coupled with a good performance in the Republican debate on Saturday night, could suffice to spur his voters to the polls.Momentum and buzz can be its own get-out-the-vote program, said Mike Dennehy, who worked on Senator John McCains winning primary campaign in the state in 2000. Mr. Dennehy said he had seen many Trump lawn signs and bumper stickers, although he ranked Mr. Trumps operation behind those of Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Mr. Cruz.The Trump campaign has started emailing supporters nationally asking them to flood New Hampshire as volunteers. An email sent Thursday to his list of Mid-Atlantic supporters offered free lodging and meals in the state as well as potential opportunities to be near Mr. Trump.Though Mr. Trumps aides declined to detail their field operations in New Hampshire, they did say they had more than a dozen paid staff members in three offices in the state. That Mr. Trump has a lot of volunteers was evident on a visit to the office building that serves as his Manchester headquarters.Beneath black-and-white photographs of Mr. Trump, including one with Ronald Reagan, roughly 30 volunteers stared at laptops or spreadsheets and made calls. Fueled on pizza, bottled water and adrenaline, they have put in 12-hour days calling in support of Mr. Trumps effort in the state.Charles Bruckerhoff, 68, a Vietnam veteran who was calling undecided voters, said he had sped up retirement to volunteer.Many people who take the calls think that were a robocall, he said. And well get about a half-sentence into it and theyll say, Are you a real person? And of course we are. We all are."}
{"text": "HONG KONG  China is spending billions of dollars on a major push to make its own microchips, an effort that could bolster its military capabilities as well as its homegrown technology industry.Those ambitions are starting to be noticed in Washington.Worries over Chinas chip ambitions were the main reason that United States officials blocked the proposed purchase for as much as $2.9 billion of a controlling stake in a unit of the Dutch electronics company Philips by Chinese investors, according to one expert and a second person involved with the deal discussions.The rare blockage underscores growing concern in Washington about Chinese efforts to acquire the know-how to make the semiconductors that work as the brains of all kinds of sophisticated electronics, including military applications like missile systems.In the case of the Philips deal, the company said late last month that it would terminate a March 2015 agreement to sell a majority stake in its auto and light-emitting diode components business known as Lumileds to a group that included the Chinese investors GO Scale Capital and GSR Ventures. It cited concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews whether foreign investments in the country present a national security risk.Philips said that despite efforts to alleviate concerns, the committee  known as Cfius  did not approve the transaction.There is a belief in the Cfius community that China has become innately hostile and that these arent just business deals anymore, said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research firm, who speaks to people connected with the committees process.Philips did not respond to requests for comment. GSR Ventures, which sponsors GO Scale Capital, declined to comment.Cfius, an interagency body that includes representatives from the Treasury and Justice Departments, declined to comment and does not make its findings public.Cfius reviews have been a growing problem for outbound Chinese deals. According to the most recent data available, in 2012 and 2013 Chinese investment accounted for more committee reviews than money coming from any other country. A 2008 Chinese effort to invest in the network equipment company 3Com was withdrawn while the committee was reviewing it.Recently, the committee found acceptable a number of major Chinese deals, including a takeover of Smithfield Foods by Shuanghui International and Lenovos takeover of IBMs low-end server unit. In 2012, President Obama ordered a Chinese company to stop building wind farms near an American military installation in Oregon after a negative Cfius review.At the center of the committees concerns on the Philips deal, according to Mr. Lewis, was a little known but increasingly important advanced semiconductor material called gallium nitride. Though not a household name like silicon, gallium nitride, often referred to by its abbreviation GaN, could be used to construct a new generation of powerful and versatile microchips.It has been used for decades in the low-energy light sources known as light-emitting diodes, and it features in technology as mundane as Blu-ray Disc players. But its resistance to heat and radiation give it a number of military and space applications. Gallium nitride chips are being used in radar for antiballistic missiles and in an Air Force radar system, called Space Fence, that is used to track space debris.Gallium nitride makes better-performing semiconductors that were key in upgrading Patriot radar systems, said Mr. Lewis. Its classic dual use, sensitive in that it could be used in other advanced weapons sensors and jamming systems.Advancing its chip industry has been a major political initiative for Beijing. In recent years, analysts said, Chinese corporate espionage and hacking efforts have been aimed at stealing chip technology, while Chinese firms have used government funds to buy foreign companies and technology and attract engineers.Last year, different subsidiaries of the state-controlled Tsinghua Holdings made a number of bids for American companies, including an unsuccessful $23 billion offer for the American memory chip maker Micron Technology and a $3.78 billion bid for a 15 percent stake in the hard-drive maker Western Digital, which was accepted.Last years spree of deal activity, and lack of American regulatory response, spurred a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Mark Newman, to say in a November report that the United States runs the risk of being asleep at the wheel. He cited efforts by South Korea and Taiwan to prevent China from acquiring some technology assets.The Lumileds block is being interpreted by the chip industry as the United States waking up a bit to the threat, Mr. Newman said in an email.Gallium nitride is particularly sensitive. One military industry magazine called the material the biggest thing since silicon, which is now commonly used to make the transistors in microchips. It cited  Raytheons use of the material to make smaller, low-powered radar for American missile systems.Many say its the most important semiconductor material since silicon, said Colin Humphreys, a British physicist at Cambridge University.He said that while it was not clear what the United States government was worried about, research by LED companies into technology linking gallium nitride and silicon could have broader implications for creating advanced microchips that could be used in a wide array of electronics.The would-be investor in Lumileds, GSR Ventures, also holds a stake in Lattice Power, a Chinese company that has been vocal about its efforts to develop technology related to gallium nitride and silicon.In a November 2015 statement about a recent investigation into Chinese industrial espionage, Taiwans Ministry of Justice also expressed worries about China aiming at the material. Calling the mass production of gallium nitride a key development project for China, the ministry said it was concerned about the theft of trade secrets from Taiwanese companies working on the material and Chinese-led recruitment of engineers knowledgeable about it."}
{"text": "For two long evenings and one long day in late January, Kaitlyn Davis sat high in the stands of Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, tucked in with her 8-month-old son, Mackston, his stuffed toy bull and a large Louis Vuitton leather carryall packed with baby supplies. Story of my life, Ms. Davis said, noting the Vuitton bag and the toy bull.Ms. Davis, 20, and her husband, Cooper Davis, 21, had driven all night from Buna, Tex., so that Mr. Davis, a professional bull rider, could compete in the three-day event, his first since winning the Professional Bull Riders world finals  along with its $250,000 purse  last October.Ms. Davis was more anxious than usual about the weekends rides. Her husband had recently sliced three tendons while working on his parents barn when a metal sheet slipped off the roof and sheared his right wrist. His hand surgeon had cleared him for normal activities, Ms. Davis said, but bull riding is not a normal activity.It is not. Bull riders endeavor to spend eight seconds  an eternity, if youre watching or living it  on the back of a one-ton animal whose bucking and spinning creates a hurricane of centrifugal force. Young men like Mr. Davis, 5 feet 9 inches tall and 140 pounds, hang on with a combination of arm strength, balance and steely focus.Its a violent, bloody and, yes, beautiful sport. Concussions, spine trauma and torn shoulders, groins and knees are its most common injuries. Mr. Davis has broken both ankles, a shoulder and his jaw. Not that you can tell by looking at him. Mr. Davis, exceedingly fair and fine-boned, appears unmarked, closer to 17 than 21.Bull riding is archaic, in that the skills on display arent needed much in modern ranch work, and its appeal is nearly mythic, particularly in the Southwestern and Western states, areas deeply imprinted by the pomp and circumstance of both the rodeo arena and the football field. A bull rider is a cowboy, distilled  an ideal of a certain kind of manhood that even today packs a wallop.If rodeo is the last tether to the frontier, as Skip Hollandsworth, a screenwriter and an executive editor of Texas Monthly, put it recently, bull riding connects to something even more primal. For these young men, many of whom are the sons of blue-collar workers, the myth of the cowboy still resonates, he said. They look like James Dean. They speak in laconic drawls. They have their own language: Hes full of try, which is an old frontier phrase. A bull is rank.But bull riding, he went on to say, is different from the gaudiness of rodeo. Its different from the corporate grandiosity of professional football. Theres no other contest between man and beast like this. People say hunting is a confrontation between man and beast. But the hunter has a gun. All the bull rider has is a rope to hang on to.This is why Ms. Davis was sweating out each night, bleary-eyed from the long drive and a tenacious cold. Im worried about his hand, she said. I wish hed waited to ride another week.Mr. Davis was typically sanguine. Its a little sore, he said. Im not thinking about it.Bull riding is a spectacle. Riders are introduced like gladiators, striding through rings of fire and other pyrotechnics, to an ear-pounding soundtrack of classic rock, classic country and pop hits. J. B. Mauney, 29, a champion rider who has won over $6 million in his career, even has his own theme song, George Thorogoods Bad to the Bone. (When this reporter met Mr. Mauney behind the chutes, she asked him, So, are you? Depends on what day it is, he said, grinning, and downed his Monster Energy drink.)The Professional Bull Riders tour was created in 1992 by 20 riders who broke away from the traditional rodeo circuit; it now holds 300 events each year. Attendance has grown from 310,000 in 1995 to 3 million in 2015. Its Built Ford Tough Series, the elite division that Mr. Davis is now competing in, holds 27 events in 20 states each year, starting in January with a three-day event at Madison Square Garden, now a sold-out affair. Television ratings for the Monster Buck-Off, which is broadcast on CBS, are up 28 percent over last year, according to the PBR, as its known. Riders may earn millions, through sponsorships and prize money.Retirement comes at an early age, and very few people walk away from the sport unscathed, as Cody Lambert, one of founders of the PBR, said. At the end, theres not a bunch of jobs just waiting for them, he said. Our dream when we started was to make it where young men could retire from the sport and have something, so they could start their own business or have their own ranch. We had watched a lot of our heroes go through their careers and have nothing at the end, and no job skills either.Stock contracting  breeding and leasing the bulls to events  can be an option. Last April, L. J. Jenkins, 28, broke his neck riding a bull named Strong Heart, ending an 11-year career. This year, he and his wife, Christen Dye, have their own stock company and are leasing bulls to the PBR. In Oklahoma City, four of their animals  Mister Mean, Hurt Me No More, Rooster and Ricky  were competing.A reporter asked Ms. Dye if she was relieved when Mr. Jenkins was forced to retire. Hed never had a really bad accident before, she said, so I never thought he was going to. I never worried.Tandy R. Freeman III, the PBRs medical director, said all bull riders are stoic about their injuries: There is an ethos some call cowboy up. Youre not supposed to complain about things, youre supposed to just do your job.I just sit up here and wait till they call his name, Ms. Davis said, recalling one terrible night last year in Springfield, Mo., when a bull named Wicked stepped on Mr. Davis after his ride. I was holding Mack and screaming my head off.Behind her, four preteen girls in nearly identical uniforms  plaid shirts, bluejeans and neatly brushed curtains of long hair  shouted out the words to Luke Bryans Country Girl (Shake It for Me). Ms. Davis tends to sits apart from the other wives and girlfriends, mostly because last year, the year Mr. Davis went pro, she was at first pregnant with Mack, and then holding Mack the newborn, a consuming situation that precluded bonding with the other women. Also, she said, Cooper and I were both newbies.Ms. Davis was studying marketing and communications at Lamar University in Beaumont, Tex., and working for a home builder when she met Mr. Davis. He courted her with the same single-minded focus he brings to bull riding. When he told her what he did for a living, she laughed. No, whats your real job? she said.Soon after they started dating two years ago, Mr. Davis bought a 5,000-square-foot brick house with white columns and white shutters on 10 acres in Buna, a traffic stop of a town 45 minutes from Beaumont. He begged Ms. Davis to move in with him, and when she hesitated, he moved all her clothes instead.My father said, If you take her, you cant bring her back, Ms. Davis recalled. Ive been there ever since.The house is airy and decorated in cowboy chic: plump, tufted English sofas in cowhide and leather; kitchen chairs with a Southwestern print upholstered by Mr. Davis. He and Ms. Davis are handy and house-proud.They each have a walk-in closet; his is as full as hers. Bull riding is messy, but riders have to be clothes hounds, wearing the logos and apparel of their sponsors, on crisply starched shirts and pressed bluejeans from Ariat, say, one of Mr. Daviss seven sponsors, or Wrangler. According to the PBR, top riders earn $75,000 to $100,000 a year from each of their sponsors. Cowboy fashion is punishing; Mr. Davis wears Band-Aids on his nipples so they dont bleed from the abundance of starch in his shirts.Ms. Davis has started a fashion company, Reign Boutique & Baby, that she promotes on Facebook and Instagram. She models the clothing, and Mr. Davis takes the photos. They are scrupulously polite and strikingly mature, particularly if one is used to the sort of college-aged person who cant seem to make a bed. We partied more before Mack arrived, they assured a reporter.When he proposed, Mr. Davis led Ms. Davis on an elaborate scavenger hunt that ended at the house, where Mr. Davis was standing in a heart-shaped ring of votive candles. On the back door, he had hung a framed chalkboard that read, in part, I dont expect things to be easy, but Ill always be here when theyre tough.Mr. Davis has been riding bulls since he was 13, to the profound dismay of his family. They all hated it, he said. But it was one of those things I wanted to do so bad, and they werent going to tell me no, and once they figured out I was pretty good, they felt better about the choice. Well, not exactly.We thought he would grow out of it, said Kim Davis, his mother. When he broke his shoulder in high school, we thought that would make him not want to ride. We begged him to stop, but there was no stopping him.Senior year, Mr. Davis was competing so often  and winning handily  that he home-schooled himself on the road. Later, he enrolled at a community college and joined its rodeo league, which meant his tuition was paid for, but he left before the semester was up because he realized he would rather go pro while he was young and strong. In October, when Mr. Davis won the World Finals, he paid off the mortgage on the house.His dad and I are still paying on our house, his mother said. I couldnt be prouder of Cooper. Not that it gets any easier watching him compete. As a mother, you never get used to it, ever.On Friday night in Oklahoma, Mr. Davis rode conservatively, and earned a decent score. Bulls and riders both accrue points: bulls for their feistiness, riders for their grace and body control. On Saturday, the chute opened before Mr. Davis was ready, and he didnt last the full eight seconds.Afterward, he didnt contest the outcome and ask for a reride. Mr. Davis is a gracious guy: Friday night after he rode, he signed autographs for a good half-hour, even though his hand was aching. Not all the riders fronted up for this post-event tradition. Sunday was a good day: Mr. Davis scored in the top 10.Late that night, Mr. Davis and Ms. Davis drove the eight hours back to Buna, dropped Mack off with his grandparents, and then immediately drove to Houston to fly to Colorado for two days of skiing before the next event that weekend in Anaheim, Calif. Speaking by phone from Breckenridge, Colo., Mr. Davis was cheerful despite not having slept. Oklahoma helped me get the monkey off my back, he said, meaning his hand. Now, Im back to riding bulls and having fun. Same old, same old."}
{"text": "BERLIN   An Algerian man suspected of training with Islamic State terrorists in Syria and of planning an attack in Germany was taken into custody at a refugee shelter in North Rhine-Westphalia early Thursday as hundreds of police officers carried out raids in three German states, the police said.The police detained the man, 35, who was not identified in keeping with German law, along with an Algerian woman whose arrest had been sought on different charges, the authorities said.The Algerian man entered Germany at the Bavarian border last fall, the news service DPA reported, citing security sources. Germany took in more than one million migrants last year and has been on high alert since the Paris terrorist attacks in November that killed 130 people,A second Algerian man was also detained in the coordinated raids, which began at 6 a.m. in Berlin, Hanover and Attendorn, a town of about 25,000 about an hours drive northeast of Cologne, a Berlin police spokesman, Stefan Redlich, said.The police found two other Algerian men they were seeking  a 31-year-old in Berlin and a 26-year-old in Hanover  but did not take them formally into custody, the authorities said.All four men are suspected of links to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and are believed to have been planning a violent act intended to seriously damage the state, Mr. Redlich said.The raids involved 450 police officers, Mr. Redlich said. In Berlin they were centered on four apartments and two businesses; in Attendorn and Hanover the investigation focused on refugee shelters.The police in North Rhine-Westphalia disclosed last month that a man who had most recently lived at a refugee shelter in the town of Recklinghausen was the lone assailant who was shot and killed in January as he approached a Paris police station on the anniversary of the assault in January 2015 on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo."}
{"text": "Martin Shkrelis grilling by Congress on Thursday proved to be the spectacle that many had long anticipated.Lawmakers excoriated him. He fidgeted, he smirked, he smiled for the cameras. And he refused to answer questions.Mr. Shkreli, the former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who is facing federal securities fraud charges, repeatedly exercised his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, infuriating members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.I dont think Ive ever seen the committee treated with such contempt, Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican, said after Mr. Shkreli was excused and left the hearing. Mr. Mica asked if Mr. Shkreli could be held in contempt of Congress. The committee chairman, Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, said he did not intend to do so.The hearing, about drug prices, focused on the actions of Turing and another company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which acquired the rights to decades-old drugs and increased their prices by huge amounts overnight.Rising drug prices have spurred public outrage, provided grist for the presidential campaign and attracted the attention of various congressional committees.The price increases by Turing and Valeant on obscure drugs account for little in terms of overall drug spending compared with smaller but still substantial increases made by other companies. But these particular increases seem to have spurred outrage even among Republicans, who in general have been less willing than Democrats to criticize the drug industrys pricing practices.Little of substance was discussed on what to do about the increases. Instead, lawmakers from both parties took turns berating Mr. Shkreli, Turing and Valeant with words like scandal, disgusting and disgraceful.Mr. Chaffetz, citing internal Turing documents, pressed Nancy Retzlaff, the companys chief commercial officer, into conceding that Turing had increased salaries of some executives to $600,000 or more and had paid $23,000 to rent a yacht for a party.Mr. Shkreli did answer yes when Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, asked if he had pronounced his name properly.Mr. Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, pounced on that, saying that Mr. Shkreli could indeed answer questions if they were not about the matters for which he was indicted, including whether he had actually purchased the single copy of an album by Wu-Tang Clan. Mr. Gowdy complained that Mr. Shkreli didnt have to be prodded to talk when granting television interviews or tweeting or live-streaming his daily life.Mr. Shkreli replied: I intend to follow the advice of my counsel, not yours. Mr. Shkrelis lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, stood up to intervene but was ordered to sit down and be quiet by Mr. Chaffetz.After being excused and leaving the room, Mr. Shkreli promptly called the lawmakers imbeciles on Twitter.Under Mr. Shkreli, Turing acquired the rights to Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug for a parasitic infection, and raised the price fiftyfold, to $750 a pill.Valeant has increased the price of numerous old drugs, but the House committee focused on two heart drugs, Isuprel and Nitropress. Valeant acquired both a year ago and immediately raised the price of Isuprel by more than 500 percent and of Nitropress by more than 200 percent, provoking protest from the hospitals that buy these drugs.Howard B. Schiller, interim chief executive of Valeant, said the two drugs were bought by hospitals, not individual patients, and that hospitals were reimbursed a set amount for the procedures in which the drugs are used. He said Valeant realized it could raise the prices substantially, cutting into hospital profits but not making the procedures unprofitable for them, and not impeding patient access to the drugs.Mr. Schiller, who is running Valeant while the chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, is on medical leave, told the committee that the company now recognized it had been too aggressive on certain pricing decisions.Where weve made mistakes, were listening and were changing, he said He said the company had decided to freeze prices of most of its drugs, though he would not say how long that would last.Both Mr. Schiller of Valeant and Ms. Retzlaff of Turing said their companies provided financial assistance to patients, in some cases paying virtually all of their co-payments, so that the high prices should not be a barrier to patients obtaining the drugs.Mark Merritt, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy benefit managers, testified that co-payment assistance programs drove up overall medical costs by removing a barrier to the use of more expensive drugs. Patients are spared the out-of-pocket expenses, but insurers are then left to pay the bill for the expensive drugs, eventually leading to increases in premiums, he said.Members of the committee, both Republicans and Democrats, either did not understand the arguments of Turing and Valeant or did not accept them.Representative Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, attacked Valeant for increasing the price to hospitals of its heart drugs. Hospitals are struggling in this country. We have to keep hospitals alive, he said.Valeants shares rose nearly 3 percent Thursday, a sign that investors did not think the hearing did much damage. Turing is privately held.Mr. Chaffetz, the committee chairman, questioned Ms. Retzlaffs assertion that Turing, a one-year-old company, was losing money, saying the company was raking it in hand over fist, and had been planning another price increase for Daraprim.He said the sales of Daraprim were $98 million in 2015. Ms. Retzlaff said that after rebates and discounts, net sales were only $20 million.The most substantial idea discussed to offset such big price increases was to speed up approvals of generic drugs.Isuprel, Nitropress and Daraprim are all so old that they are no longer protected by patents. Before the large price increases, sales of those drugs were probably too small to interest generic manufacturers. But with the greater revenue from higher prices, that could change.However, the Food and Drug Administration has been faced with a huge backlog of applications for approval of generic drugs, giving companies like Valeant and Turing a few years to enjoy high profits before facing competition.Dr. Janet Woodcock, a senior F.D.A. official, told the committee that the agency was making swift progress in whittling down the backlog.Mr. Merritt said in his written testimony that the F.D.A. should consider expedited reviews of generic versions of drugs that have sharply increased in price. The F.D.A., however, typically does not pay attention to drug prices.Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, who had pressed for the hearing to be held, lectured Mr. Shkreli.At one point, after Mr. Shkreli had apparently smirked, Mr. Cummings snapped: Its not funny, Mr. Shkreli. People are dying and they are getting sicker and sicker.He called on Mr. Shkreli to use his newfound fame and knowledge of the drug industry to become an advocate on behalf of patients for lower prices.The way I see it, you can go down in history as the poster boy for greedy drug company executives or you can change the system. Yeah, you, Mr. Cummings said.Mr. Brafman, who became Mr. Shkrelis lawyer only this week, said some of his clients behavior at the hearing was a result of nervous energy. He said it was frustrating that Mr. Shkreli could not counter false statements about Turing because of the pending criminal charges.When all of the facts about Daraprim and Turing are openly disclosed, I think everyone will recognize that Mr. Shkreli is not a villain, hes not a bad boy, Mr. Brafman said after Mr. Shkreli had left the hearing. I think at the end of this story, hes a hero."}
{"text": "The secret buyer for a plaster Picasso bust at the center of a custody battle was named this week in New York federal court documents as Leon D. Black, a billionaire financier and art collector who is co-chairman of the board of the Museum of Modern Art.The 1931 bust of Picassos mistress Marie-Thrse Walter, one of the stars of MoMAs blockbuster show that closes Sunday, is at the center of a tug of war over ownership between the New York dealer Larry Gagosian and an agent for the Qatar royal family. Both groups claim the sculpture was sold to them by the daughter of Picasso and Ms. Walter, Maya Widmaier-Picasso, who is 80.In legal actions in three countries, the Qatari familys representative, Pelham Holdings, contends that it unsuccessfully sought to seize the sculpture in France from her and did not discover its whereabouts until a lawyer spotted it in October in the MoMA show.In their latest court filing Wednesday in a federal court, Pelham said that the Gagosian gallery acquired the sculpture to sell eventually to Mr. Black, whom they have also added as a defendant in their counter lawsuit against Mr. Gagosian. Mr. Gagosian, who says that he did not know about a previous sale to Pelham, bought the sculpture in May for about $106 million and then sold it. The Gagosian gallery has sought to quiet the ownership claims with its own lawsuit filed in New York last month. Earlier, both sides had agreed that the sculpture would remain with the Gagosian Gallery until the legal conflict is resolved."}

{"text": "At first glance, Bernie Sanderss voters in Iowa this week looked a lot like Barack Obamas from 2008. Both were strongest among young, independent-leaning, liberal men.Yet with the actual results of the Democratic caucuses in and counted, it is clear that Mr. Sanderss coalition is very different.Oddly, Hillary Clinton lost in some of the few places where she did well in her bid for the presidential nomination in 2008, while Mr. Sanders lost some of Mr. Obamas strongest areas.He even ran behind Mr. Obama in Iowas liberal college towns, even though Mr. Sanders benefited from a stupendous 84-13 point victory among those aged 17 to 29. (You can take part in the Iowa caucuses if you will be 18 by Election Day.)The surprising geography of the Iowa caucus results shows just how much the fissures in this years race differ from the divides in 2008  with big consequences for the race.The big difference is class and income.In 2008, Mrs. Clinton was pummeled among affluent voters. She lost voters earning more than $100,000 by 41 to 19 percent, according to entrance polls.This time, she won big among voters making more than $100,000 per year, by 55 to 37 percent.Mrs. Clintons strength among affluent voters is partly because of age: Affluent voters tend to be older, and Mrs. Clinton excels among older voters.But thats not the whole explanation: Among voters over age 30, she won those making more than $100,000 by a 31-point margin, more than twice her 14-point lead among those making less.The same story was clear in pre-election polling, both in Iowa and elsewhere.Her strength in affluent suburbs around Des Moines flipped the Des Moines metro area, which went strongly for Mr. Obama in 2008. It probably played a big part in suppressing Mr. Sanderss margins in college towns like Iowa City, where Mr. Sanders might have been expected to run as well as Mr. Obama or even better, given his tremendous strength among young voters.Mr. Sanderss weakness among affluent voters is potentially a bad sign for his chances. In 2008, voters making more than $100,000 a year represented 25 percent of the national electorate but just 19 percent of Iowa caucus-goers, suggesting that the state may be a relatively good one for a candidate, like Mr. Sanders, who does best among less affluent voters. On Super Tuesday, the most liberal states happen to be particularly affluent ones, like Massachusetts, Colorado, Virginia and Minnesota.But there is a bright side for Mr. Sanders: To some extent, he compensated for his losses among affluent voters by doing best among lower-income voters. He won white voters making less than $50,000 by nine points, 53 to 44 percent. Mr. Obama had lost white voters making less than $50,000 per year by two percentage points in 2008. Mr. Sanders was nearly as competitive as Mr. Obama across rural Iowa. He even won along the border with Nebraska  the relatively conservative, western part of the state that was basically the one place Mrs. Clinton won in 2008.Its not hard to imagine why Mr. Sanders might have run better than Mr. Obama among less affluent voters. Mr. Sanders has focused on class issues, unlike Mr. Obama, who focused on many of the priorities of well-educated voters, like climate change and foreign policy. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has adopted a more pragmatic message that may have more appeal to affluent voters than a political revolution.Mr. Sanders might have also benefited from a change in the ideological composition of working-class voters. More conservative working-class whites may have switched over to the G.O.P. over the last few years, or simply found themselves unwilling to turn out this time for Mrs. Clinton, who has run a steadfastly liberal campaign.Theres also the possibility that Mr. Sanders has benefited from being white, but its worth noting that Mr. Obama has consistently shown strength among less-educated white voters in Iowa  in his winning caucus showing in 2008 and both general elections.Whether Mr. Sanderss less affluent coalition is a stronger or weaker base of support among white voters than the one Mr. Obama held is an open question. In Iowa, clearly it was a weaker one  he lost.Ultimately, the South will determine whether strength among less affluent voters helps Mr. Sanders outdo Mr. Obama, who was crushed among less educated and less affluent white voters in the region. Theres clearly a lot of upside for a populist candidate to fare better among less affluent white Southerners, even if it is still unclear whether Mr. Sanders can capitalize on it enough to best Mrs. Clinton."}
{"text": "Is the American worker finally getting a raise?After years of scant real gains despite steadily falling unemployment and healthy hiring, wages picked up significantly last month, a sign the job market could be tightening enough to force companies to pay more to attract and retain employees.The half a percentage point increase in average hourly earnings in January was the brightest spot in a generally positive Labor Department report on Friday, which showed job creation slowing from the white-hot pace of late 2015 even as the unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.The last six months were the best extended period for employee paychecks since the recovery began six-and-a-half years ago.That gain in average hourly earnings is significant, said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. Sustained increases are still needed to make up for years of stagnation, she added, but its a move in the right direction, and thats reassuring.Economists also said that the new figures suggested that the American economy was holding up well despite a slowdown in China, growing risks in emerging markets and turmoil in the stock market.The financial markets are leery, said Michael Hanson, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, but the labor market still looks like its continuing to grow.President Obama, who expressed frustration that he has not received the credit he feels he deserves for the countrys improving economy, said the jobs numbers were further signs of progress.After reaching 10 percent in 2009, the unemployment rate has now fallen to 4.9 percent even as more Americans joined the job market last month, he told reporters at a White House briefing in Washington. Americans are working.Over all, employers added 151,000 jobs last month, a pace that is strong enough to keep soaking up people looking for work if it continues in the months ahead, but a big step down from Decembers revised increase of 262,000.The combination of rising pay with a slower pace of hiring and downward pressure on prices from a stronger dollar complicates the picture for the Federal Reserve as it contemplates its next interest rate increase.Wages have shown month-to-month strength during the recovery, only to lapse back into a funk. But a slight increase in the length of the typical workweek in January also bodes well for future salary increases, as do private reports showing the same pattern.An increase in the minimum wage in more than a dozen states at the beginning of 2016 may also be giving hourly earnings an extra tailwind.A December survey by PwC, the accounting and consulting firm, showed companies budgeting for salary raises of nearly 3 percent in 2016, the biggest annual increase since the recovery began. More than a third of executives said they were worried that labor costs could eat into corporate profit margins, nearly twice the number who cited that fear a year ago.No doubt about it, Im hearing that executives are seeing wage pressures and not just in a few pockets of the country, said Ken Esch, a partner at PwC. Its pretty broad-based.Managers like Dave Rozenboom, president of First Premier Bank in Sioux Falls, S.D., have had to hand out raises for both existing employees and new hires.Starting salaries for workers who handle credit card customer service and collections recently rose to $13 an hour from $11.75, Mr. Rozenboom said. Hospitals and construction firms in Sioux Falls, where the unemployment rate is 2.6 percent, are also hiring.The economy is as strong as it has ever been here, Mr. Rozenboom said Its a very tight labor market, and we continue to hire.Sioux Fallss situation may be unusually robust, but the upward trajectory in employment across the country suggests to some analysts that Main Street business leaders like Mr. Rozenboom know something that the Wall Street pessimists dont.The January employment report provides yet one more piece of evidence that the chance of recession this year is truly remote, said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J. Economic activity should accelerate this year as rising employment, income, home values and confidence drive more spending.Of course, markets are mercurial, foreseeing some recessions that never come to pass, while economists often fail to see that the good times are coming to an end right up until the music stops.There certainly have been reasons for investors to feel edgy lately, including weakness in China, plunging oil prices and disappointing retail sales figures.Those industries closely tied to commodity markets where prices are dropping showed real weakness last month. Stripping out seasonal adjustments, oil and gas drillers laid off more than 2,000 workers in January, wiping out four years of employment gains. The overall mining industry, which includes the oil sector, has shed 146,000 jobs since September 2014.But jobs in manufacturing, in a reversal from its weakness in the second half of 2015, surged last month, rising by 29,000. The strong dollar and weak export markets in Asia and Europe have hurt factory employment, but some experts suggested that the worst might now be over.Its a sign the manufacturing sector may be stabilizing, said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the factory sector in the United States is not nearly the size it once was, it plays an important role in the ups and downs of the business cycle and is a source of better-paying jobs for blue-collar workers who have fared poorly in recent decades.The construction industry, another source of higher-paying working-class jobs, also held up well, adding 18,000 jobs despite the colder weather in the eastern half of the country.The overall figures for job creation, as well as the sector-by-sector data, are likely to be revised in future months as more data comes in. The proportion of Americans who are in the labor force, which has been stuck at lows not seen since the late 1970s, ticked up slightly in January.As has been the case since the current recovery began in mid-2009, the most educated workers are doing the best in todays job market: The unemployment rate for college graduates was unchanged in January at 2.5 percent, while joblessness rose to 7.4 percent for people without a high school diploma.We do think the unemployment rate will continue to drift lower and that will support wage growth, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. We dont think the economy is sliding into a recession."}

{"text": "When used as intended, Tinder, the mobile dating application, can provide many things: actual dating, long-term relationships, casual sex, new friends, mindless entertainment or validation that at least the occasional stranger finds you minimally attractive.Presidential campaigning is typically low on the list of priorities when opening the smartphone app, which allows people to exchange messages after they have mutually agreed to a match, based often on little more than physical appearance.But Robyn Gedrich, 23, of Brick, N.J., had other ideas. Over the past two weeks, she matched with as many men as she could, not bothering to check their profiles before swiping right (an action to signal interest, the digital-era equivalent of knowing eye contact across the room).Her goal was not dating or anything more salacious; she merely wanted men to sign up for mobile updates from Bernie Sanderss presidential campaign.Ms. Gedrich, who works in retail as a sales manager, said in an interview Friday that she would send more than 50 men a day the same text: Do you feel the bern? Please text WORK to 82623 for me. Thanks!Some men flirted in response, others engaged in political discussions, and yet others ignored her.Whether she converted many New Jersey voters to Mr. Sanders, who is vying with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, is unknown. But without the ability to participate in more traditional campaign activities, Ms. Gedrich said, she thought she would use whatever tool was in front of her.Working full time and trying to get back into school, theres not that much time I can volunteer to get out places, she said. I just tried to do what I could with what I had.Ms. Gedrichs campaign experiment was short-lived. Tinder suspended her account Thursday; it did not explain why, but she suspects that some of the men reported her entreaty as spam.We wholeheartedly support people sharing their political views on Tinder, but we dont allow spamming, Rosette Pambakian, a Tinder spokeswoman, said in an email. So feel free to spread the Bern, just dont spam.Indeed, several of the men were not pleased with her approach, Ms. Gedrich said. She presented herself just as many other women on Tinder would: with photos of herself, one in which she was dressed up as a zombie, and a link to her Instagram page.Some of the men, predictably, were crude. Her response? I would correct their grammar, and tell them this is why Bernie Sanders should be president, she said.Tinders ban of Ms. Gedrich was first reported by BuzzFeed.Of course, politics, like religion and money, is not always a welcome topic early in courtships. Jillian Chase, 27, a Tinder user in New York, said the election would occasionally come up with her matches, but only in a lighthearted manner.I generally adhere to the social mores of refraining from in-depth political conversations with relative strangers, she said.Ms. Gedrich said she hoped to get her account back, and then would continue to spread her political message  but with, perhaps, a more tactful approach.I guess I will slow down and say hi first, she said."}
{"text": "Despite allegations that he struck his former girlfriend, the troubled quarterback Johnny Manziel has not been charged with a crime, and two Texas police departments have closed their cases on a possible assault.Manziel, who will almost certainly be released by the Cleveland Browns next month, ending two turbulent seasons with the team, was being investigated for reportedly striking the woman, Colleen Crowley, last weekend. She told the police in Fort Worth that Manziel had struck her several times and that Manziel, the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner, acted as if he were on some kind of drugs, but she maintained he was not intoxicated.A police report released Thursday provided the first details of the altercation between Manziel and Crowley, first at a hotel in Dallas and then as the couple drove back to her Fort Worth apartment. Both police departments investigated the episode but did not charge Manziel.It was determined that no reported criminal offense occurred within Fort Worths jurisdiction, Sgt. Steve Enright said in an email.The Dallas police issued a statement Thursday night saying they had conducted the appropriate investigative follow-up to the report forwarded to us by the Fort Worth Police Department regarding an alleged incident involving Johnny Manziel.The statement added, Investigative efforts to date have not resulted in the filing of a criminal complaint, and the incident is determined to be closed.Manziel is facing possible punishment by the N.F.L., which is investigating the altercation.It is the second time since October that Manziel has been under review by the league for a domestic episode. He was cleared of wrongdoing after the police were called when he and Crowley got into a heated roadside argument in Avon, Ohio.Crowley told the Fort Worth police that Manziel was aggressive toward her after they were out with friends on Friday night. She said that he struck her, including once in the left ear, before they drove back to Fort Worth, and that he was physical with her during the ride.

{"text": "Benjamin T. Jealous, a prominent black leader and former N.A.A.C.P.  president, endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president on Friday and vowed to increase his support among black voters in South Carolina, a crucial primary state, as well as across the country.Mr. Jealous, who led the N.A.A.C.P. from 2008 to 2013, said he gave his endorsement because Mr. Sanders opposes the death penalty, will combat institutional racism and has the best plan for ending mass incarceration and improving community policing.As the race for the Democratic presidential nomination moves beyond Iowa and New Hampshire into more diverse primary states, Mr. Sanders must work hard to compete with Hillary Clinton, who has a big lead on Mr. Sanders among black voters, who have known and supported her and former President Bill Clinton for years.Mr. Jealous said he planned to spread Mr. Sanderss message and believed the race between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton was reaching a real tipping point.Having helped strengthen Obamas efforts in 2008, I know how things can turn very, very quickly, Mr. Jealous said.  As somebody who has organized throughout the entire South, I intend to be very engaged and to help build the campaign in the South and quite frankly help to build it in the cities of the Midwest and throughout the country where you see both large black and brown populations.Mr. Jealous and Mr. Sanders made the announcement during a conference call on Friday after snow in New Hampshire forced the campaign to cancel a news conference in Exeter, N.H.In explaining his plan to help Mr. Sanders, Mr. Jealous also praised his  past work and his policy ideas.Throughout his life he has been a fearless, tireless and trustworthy champion for the right of all our nations children to have full and unfettered access to the American dream, Mr. Jealous said. Bernie Sanders has the courage to confront the institutionalized racism and bias that stains our nation. Bernie Sanders leads with the sort of freedom-minded conviction that strikes fear in the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the worst of Wall Street.Mr. Sanders stressed that his plans to make public colleges tuition free, to raise the minimum wage and to focus on creating jobs would especially help people of color, who face higher rates of incarceration, and black youth, who face higher rates of unemployment. The senator also said, as he has in the past, that if elected he would work on reforming police departments and federally decriminalizing marijuana possession.He added that he knows he is not well known in South Carolina, especially among black people, but expects to make huge progress in the state. He also said that as soon as New Hampshire votes, he would be spending as much time as possible in Nevada and South Carolina, where the nominating contests come later this month.I think, frankly, that we do have the agenda that will make sense to the African-American community both in terms of economics and in terms of criminal justice and other issues, Mr. Sanders said. I think our job is to get that agenda out aggressively, and I think Ben Jealous is going to be an enormous help in enabling us to do this not only in South Carolina but across the country."}
{"text": "Heres how we analyzed the fifth Democratic debate in real time, and our live fact checks._____Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate on Thursday at 9 p.m. Eastern, just days after the two fought to a virtual draw in the Iowa caucuses.It will be the fifth face-off between the two, but their first one-on-one contest, after former Gov. Martin OMalley of Maryland dropped out of the race on Monday.We asked New York Times political reporters what they would be looking for in the last Democratic debate before New Hampshires primary on Tuesday.____After Mrs. Clinton overwhelmingly  even shockingly  lost millennial voters in Iowa by 70 points to Mr. Sanders, Ill be watching to see if she turns the focus from her rsum  a misty past beyond the recall of voters under 30  toward the future, offering an optimistic vision of what she hopes to accomplish. Conversely, because Mr. Sanders lost seniors in Iowa by 43 points, I want to see if he tailors his message to try to bridge some of the gap. Trip Gabriel_____Im curious to see if  and how  Mr. Sanders will seek to explain his plan to raise taxes on all Americans to pay for his Medicare for all health care program, given the hostility toward taxes and tax increases among the many so-called independent voters in New Hampshire, a key demographic for him in the primary. Patrick Healy_____I will be watching to see whether Mrs. Clinton more forcefully reminds voters that Mr. Sanders was not a Democrat until he decided to run for president. Its something she danced around in the last debate, and has allowed surrogates to raise, but hasnt said it directly. It wont necessarily help with all the independents in New Hampshire, but it could be a smart play looking ahead to Nevada, South Carolina and beyond. Amy Chozick_____Given her need for a lift here, Ill be interested to see if Mrs. Clinton makes a play for New Hampshires famously fickle independent voters by directly attacking Mr. Sanders as a pie-in-the-sky idealist who wouldnt be able to get anything done. Jonathan Martin_____Ill be looking for how comfortable Mr. Sanders seems lobbing barbs across the stage now that he knows he came so close to winning Iowa. And Ill be watching for whether Mrs. Clinton appears rattled, as she did the other night in her speech after the Iowa results. Maggie Haberman_____Im looking to see if Mr. Sanders seeks to broaden his appeal to independents by explicitly saying his message resonates with more than just liberals and Democrats. I also am looking for him to criticize Mrs. Clinton for raising money in Philadelphia and New York, and what her response will be. Jason Horowitz_____Mr. Sanders has drawn contrasts with Mrs. Clinton in his advertisements over just one issue: campaign contributions and speaking fees from Wall Street banks. Ill be watching for any more explicit statements or accusations from Mr. Sanders on that theme that may turn into a future digital ad or earn cable news attention. Nick Corasaniti_____I will be watching for Mr. Sanders to talk more about foreign policy issues. He canceled a speech on the topic and had a press conference on foreign trade policies Wednesday, perhaps hoping that focusing on these issues will help voters see him as stronger on international affairs, an area where Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, has had the upper hand.

Ask me anything: foodeditor@nytimes.com.Im a millennial in a New York City apartment with a small kitchen, and my question for you is what cooking essentials does a moderately skilled home cook need? A chefs knife and a paring knife, obviously, but what else do you think is important? A food processor? A pressure cooker?You dont need a pressure cooker. A food processor is nice to have, but you dont need that either. What you need in addition to your knives is a pair of tongs, a wooden cutting board and a good, big, lidded saut pan of the sort you can buy at a kitchen supply shop for around $40. Also, an enameled Dutch oven for stews, soups and roasting chickens (theyre spendy, so keep an eye out for sales, or go to Ikea), as well as a half sheet pan and a bunch of aluminum mixing bowls. Maybe a colander. Aspire to a rice cooker, and buy one when they clip your boss at work and give you her job.You are an inspiration to me for your approach to everyday cooking. However, you do it as part of your job, which makes it inherently manly. I too love to cook every day. My problem comes when I tell friends about my cooking habits. Most of them dont seem to know what to do with me, and usually I get a raised eyebrow and comments along the lines of That must really make your wife happy. It does, but apparently there arent too many men out here making their wives happy in this particular way. How do I enjoy my passion for turning beautiful ingredients into beautiful food and not feel too weird about it?Dude, srsly? You live in some kind of old Alan Alda film that was never released? Kitchens are the new basement workshop for boyfriends and husbands, dads and granddads alike. Theyre filled with tools and projects, the promise of craft that can rise to art, everything a fellow needs to fill the holes in his life created by corporate culture and American ennui. But where our own grandfathers hand-painted model airplanes or rebuilt carburetors pleased only the maker (and me!), a perfectly executed spaghetti alla carbonara or grilled steak or cassoulet brings happiness to all who eat it. Keep cooking. Your friends will follow along soon enough, just you watch.I hate a Valentines Day dinner out. Too impersonal and not romantic enough.

{"text": "DAKAR, Senegal   United Nations peacekeepers in the Central African Republic raped or sexually exploited at least eight women and girls last fall, including a young teenager who said she was released only because she had managed to scream, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Thursday.In a country where armed groups routinely prey on civilians, peacekeepers should be protectors, not predators, said Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.The United Nations mission in the Central African Republic confirmed that it had been informed by Human Rights Watch about the reports findings and said it had taken steps to address them. One of the episodes had been previously reported and was already under investigation, the mission said in a statement.The statement said that the home countries of the accused peacekeepers, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, had been notified and asked to begin investigations. The mission also said it had ordered the repatriation of 120 Republic of Congo soldiers, who were immediately confined to barracks.Allegations of rape by peacekeepers have mounted in the Central African Republic, one of the continents poorest and most unstable countries. A spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called abuses by troops in the nation rampant, noting that about 10 international peacekeeping contingents have now been implicated in cases of sexual abuse.According to the Human Rights Watch report, one of the victims, a 14-year-old girl, said she had been attacked after walking by troops near Bambari Airport in the center of the country.Suddenly, one of them grabbed me by my arms, and the other one ripped off my clothes, the girl told human rights workers, according to the report. They pulled me into the tall grass, and one held my arms while the other one pinned down my legs and raped me.The soldier holding my arms tried to hold my mouth, but I was still able to scream, she said.Each victim said that she believed the suspects were from the Republic of Congo or the Democratic Republic of Congo.Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, the United Nations secretary generals special representative in the Central African Republic, said the new cases raised by Human Rights Watch meant that the mission now has the sad record, among all peacekeeping operations, of dealing with the most cases of sexual misconduct.Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to insist that troops home countries prosecute the crimes and take responsibility for helping survivors. Only one of the eight victims received medical or psychological care, according to the report.Less than two months ago, an independent panel assailed how the United Nations handles cases of abuse committed by peacekeepers and recommended changes to ensure quick accountability and protection of victims. The panel was created by the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, after allegations arose that French peacekeepers deployed in the Central African Republic had sexually abused children as young as 9, luring them with food."}
{"text": "If you were a young iPhone-carrying client of RocketBank, a Russian start-up that offers app-based banking, you would have gotten some mixed messages on Thursday, Jan. 28. At 1:10 p.m., you would have received a letter written in RocketBanks trademark pally style, only worrisome, and accompanied by a shruggie emoji:Hi [clients first name], our longtime partner Commercial Bank Intercommerz is having cash-flow issues. Technically, that doesnt necessarily mean that you would have problems with RocketBank cards serviced by Intercommerz, but times being anxious as they are, we would like to warn you as soon as we can and help you take precautions. The letter went on to instruct clients to withdraw or transfer any funds they had on Intercommerz-serviced RocketBank-issued debit-card accounts.You would have been well-advised to follow the instructions posthaste. Within an hour and a half, Intercommerz stopped servicing RocketBank cards. Money could not be withdrawn or transferred, and no purchases could be made.At 3:50 p.m., RocketBank sent out a second letter to its customers:Hi [clients first name], earlier today we did something hasty, without really checking all the facts, by sending out a letter recommending that clients withdraw funds from RocketBank cards issued by Intercommerz Bank. This was an unjustified action on the part of our marketing department, and we apologize, first of all, to our esteemed partner Intercommerz Bank, as well as to you, our dear clients. We ask you not to give in to panic that could harm the bank.But Intercommerz-issued RocketBank cards did not start working again after this letter.The next day, RocketBank posted a long explanation on its website. It recounted the chronology of the contradictory letters and said that Intercommerz Bank had demanded that RocketBank retract the information in its first letter if it wanted Intercommerz to renew services to its clients. After the retraction  the second letter  went out, Intercommerz upped the price of renewing services, demanding that RocketBank arrange for the retraction to be published in the media. Then, said the RocketBank post, even after RocketBank complied with this condition to the best of its ability, Intercommerz did not unblock its cards.By the time this explanation was published, the Russian Central Bank had appointed a temporary administration at Intercommerz, essentially beginning a bankruptcy process.Banks have been going belly-up in Russia with alarming regularity and, generally speaking, little publicity. The RocketBank incident provides a rare glimpse not only into the routine business of bankruptcy but also into the peculiarity of communication in contemporary Russia. Most of the time, information is perceived and treated solely as an instrument of manipulation. Truth is what the stronger party says it is. Nothing shapes a message better than blackmail.That Russia is a land of lies and propaganda is hardly news, and so the RocketBank incident is telling in another way. The Russian economic crisis, although undeniably severe  the ruble is worth against the U.S. dollar today less than half of what it was worth two years ago  has proceeded in a calm, almost plodding way. Contrary to what some hopeful critics of the Putin regime once predicted, Russians have not taken to the streets in response to plummeting living standards. Never mind protests: There has been nary a bank run.Thats because even panic requires open lines of communication. Free media can help spread panic. But Russian television, which is where the vast majority of people get their information, alternates between uplifting stories about growing domestic production and Russias boundless resources, and fear-mongering reports about United States aggression toward Russia.President Vladimir Putin has on several occasions told the nation that dropping oil prices and economic sanctions have only strengthened the Russian economy. Sure, Russians are watching the exchange rate fall while the prices of goods in grocery stores rise, but they do not see their subjective experience affirmed anywhere outside the narrow confines of their kitchens and social-network groups.When your president, your bank and your boss keep lying to you, claiming that things are just fine even as you witness your real purchasing power evaporate, they may not be able to convince you that everything is fine, but they are able to sow doubt. And by routinely denying your lived experience, they also succeed in demonstrating their power over you, if not over the actual economy.Most important, they effectively prevent the emergence of any social consensus that could, in turn, lead to panic or even protest. So the Russian economy will likely continue its downward slide in eerie silence, leaving every Russian alone with the misery of growing poorer every day."}
{"text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich.   Robin Lopez was less than an hour removed from the Knicks most deflating loss of the season, and he took the long view. The Knicks had toyed with the basketball gods by filling the first half with putrid basketball, and they ultimately got what they deserved when the Detroit Pistons escaped Thursday night with a 111-105 victory.Youre not supposed to win games when you beat yourself like that, Lopez said. All the scrambling, all the rallying in the last two quarters  thats negated. I wouldve loved to have gotten the win. But youre kind of cheating yourself that way, I suppose.It was an intellectual way of analyzing an utterly chaotic  and incomprehensible  48 minutes of basketball at the Palace of Auburn Hills. The Knicks (23-29), who had been so desperate to reassemble their confidence, instead found themselves trailing by 27 points in the second quarter. They could not have played worse.Yet they still had time: to stage something dramatic; to cobble together a series of adequate possessions; to figure out how to actually play defense. The result was that they somehow managed to take a 2-point lead late in the fourth quarter  a lead that lasted all of 27 seconds.Anthony Tolliver and Reggie Jackson put the Pistons (27-24) back on top with consecutive 3-pointers. Jacksons 3 pushed the lead to 4, and the Knicks wheezed down the stretch.We werent ready, said Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 5 points on 2 of 9 shooting. We got kicked in the face in the first half.Lopez propelled the Knicks late surge, finishing with 26 points and 16 rebounds, and Arron Afflalo scored 19 of his 24 points in the second half. But while Carmelo Anthony collected 19 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists, he also shot just 4 of 18 from the field.It was off, Anthony said of his shooting touch. Nothing to say about that. It was off.After an energetic flirtation with .500, the Knicks find themselves in danger of plummeting out of relevance a week ahead of the All-Star break. Despite their near comeback, they lost for the seventh time in eight games.It was a loss they could ill afford against the Pistons, who are also vying for playing contention in the East. Stanley Johnson had 22 points and 9 rebounds for Detroit, and Jackson finished with 21 points. The Pistons won without Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, their starting shooting guard. He strained his groin in Detroits loss Wednesday to the Boston Celtics.For that reason, and others, the game was an opportunity for the Knicks, who were presumably facing a fatigued opponent. The Knicks were also welcoming the return of Jose Calderon to the starting lineup after he had missed the previous four games with a groin injury.Instead, Anthony helped open the festivities with an air ball on the Knicks first possession. Bounce passes skipped past their targets. Jump shots sailed long. Defensive assignments went ignored. The first half was a horror show for the Knicks, who shot 27.9 percent. Brandon Jennings breezed past a series of defenders for a layup, giving the Pistons a 60-36 lead at the half.The Knicks trudged to the locker room as if their sneakers were full of cement.We felt embarrassed, Anthony said.Theres no explanation, Porzingis said.Inexcusable, Lopez said.Coach Derek Fisher delivered a fiery speech at halftime  He got on us, which hes supposed to do, Anthony said  and the Knicks responded by mounting a huge run, spanning the third and fourth quarters. Lance Thomas, who received six stitches to his lower lip, returned to give the team a jolt off the bench. Langston Galloway, who scored 12 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter, tied the game at 95-95 with a 3-pointer, and Lopez added a layup. But just as quickly as the Knicks had the lead, it was gone  gone when Tolliver pulled up from 27 feet, and really gone when Jackson connected on a 3-pointer seconds later.Before the game, Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy refused to buy into the popular narrative  one pushed by Fisher  that the Knicks are an especially young team. I laugh a little bit when I see them referred to as a young, developing team, Van Gundy said. I wasnt aware that Robin Lopez, Carmelo Anthony, Jose Calderon and Arron Afflalo were that young. It was hard not to interpret Van Gundys comments as a repudiation of what Fisher offered up this week in a radio interview, when he described the Knicks as a developing team with a ton of new players. On Thursday, Fisher reiterated that he felt it was too early for his team to focus on the standings.Were an inconsistent team, he said before the game. I think a lot of teams in our league are facing similar circumstances with schedule, injuries, ups and downs.Against the Pistons, all those inconsistencies were again on display. The Knicks continue to dig for solutions."}
{"text": "SYDNEY, Australia  Australian health officials issued a national recall of packaged lettuce and other salad products on Thursday after 28 cases of salmonella poisoning in the state of Victoria.The outbreak, at the height of Australias summer, the salad-eating season, has been traced to more than 20 products of bagged lettuce and other salad leaves produced by Tripod Farmers. They are sold mostly through major supermarket chains  Woolworths, Safeway, Coles and Bi-Lo  in most states and territories.Two people have been admitted to the hospital, and more cases are expected in the coming days, said Dr. Finn Romanes, the senior medical adviser at Victorias department of health. Salmonella usually strikes between six and 72 hours after the bacteria is ingested.This particular strain of salmonella that we have detected, salmonella anatum, usually only occurs in very small numbers in Victoria, Dr. Romanes said at a news conference in Melbourne on Thursday. So far this year, we have been notified of 28 cases.He said the common factor was packaged salad, and some products from the company had tested positive for the strain of salmonella. The cause of the contamination had not been determined, he said.A salmonella infection causes gastroenteritis that can last many days. It is not usually fatal, but the health department has warned that elderly people, young children or those whose immune systems are compromised may be at more serious risk.Frank Ruffo, the managing director at Tripod Farmers, said the company had issued a voluntary recall of some of its products, and was working closely with the authorities. Tripod Farmers employs 400 people, growing lettuce and leafy vegetables, including watercress, sorrel, baby cos lettuce and wild arugula, known in Australia as rocket leaves, in Victoria.Dr. Romanes said the anatum strain of salmonella was uncommon and could be traced back to chickens and eggs, and possibly chicken-based fertilizer. He said processed salad products were usually washed three times before being packaged and distributed to supermarket chains. Tripod Farmers is both a retailer and wholesale supplier.In a separate episode, a cruise ship that docked in Sydney Harbor on Thursday after a 12-day cruise reported 158 passengers and some crew members had been struck down by gastroenteritis. About 4,000 passengers were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise to New Zealand.A spokesman for the New South Wales health department, Professor Mark Ferson, said the outbreak had been contained. Passengers who were sick had been asked to stay in their rooms to limit the spread of the disease."}
{"text": "LONDON   With no end in sight to Syrias five-year-old civil war, rich nations pledged more than $10 billion on Thursday to help the millions of people who have been displaced by the conflict and to prepare for new waves of refugees expected this year.The pledges of aid at a donor conference in London slightly exceeded the meetings goal, avoiding the failure of a similar conference last year, when cutbacks in aid helped spur mass migration of refugees to Europe.Still, it was unclear whether the new aid pledged on Thursday would be sufficient to meet the need, which seems likely to grow substantially as more Syrians flee to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan and as more asylum seekers attempt the perilous trip to Europe with the coming of warmer weather.Just one day before the conference, United Nations-led talks in Geneva aimed at achieving a cease-fire in Syria were abruptly suspended. The conflict has claimed more than 250,000 lives and displaced 11 million Syrians from their homes, including four million who have fled the country.Our message to the people of Syria and the region is clear, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said at the conference. We will stand with you, and we still support you for as long as it takes to secure peace in Syria, to restore stability to the region, and to give Syrian refugees a chance to go back and rebuild their homes and their country.Mr. Cameron was one of the hosts of the conference, along with the leaders of Germany, Kuwait and Norway and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban called the meeting a great success and said, Never has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis.Almost $6 billion of the new pledges was for this year, while $5 billion was committed for 2017 through 2020. The United States, represented at the conference by Secretary of State John Kerry, pledged about $600 million in new aid. In all, the United States has now committed $5.1 billion in aid since 2011, the most of any nation.The suffering of Syrias people should tear at the conscience of all civilized people, and we all have a responsibility to respond to it, Mr. Kerry said.Britain pledged an additional $1.8 billion over the next four years, doubling its contributions so far, while Germany promised $2.6 billion by 2018, including $1.2 billion this year.There was broad agreement at the conference, though, that the only enduring way to address the humanitarian crisis was to end the fighting in Syria between the forces of President Bashar al-Assad and a fragmented array of opposition groups, some of whom are also fighting one another.Last years aid conference aimed for $7 billion but managed to raise only half that amount, prompting United Nations organizations to slash the food rations for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, which took in one million refugees last year, said those cutbacks were a major reason so many desperate Syrians left refugee camps and headed for Europe.The participants at this years conference were determined not to repeat that failure.Last years surge of migrants was a huge, loud, wake-up call for the people in Europe and beyond Europe, said Werner Hoyer, the president of the European Investment Bank and a former deputy foreign minister of Germany. Providing aid now, he said, is much more economic than to wait until everybody has reached Amsterdam or Copenhagen and needs health care and schooling there.The difficulties of finding a long-term solution to the conflict hung over the conference. Mr. Ban endorsed the decision by the United Nations mediator, Staffan de Mistura, to suspend the Geneva talks on Wednesday, only two days after they formally started. We should not have talks only for the sake of talks, Mr. Ban said. The coming days should be used to get back to the table, not to secure more gains on the battlefield.Though Syrian government forces, supported by Russian airstrikes, are conducting a major military offensive, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported on Thursday that aid convoys had managed to reach Moadhamiyeh, one of 18 Syrian towns besieged by the government or by rebel forces. The Red Cross said the convoys delivered enough aid to feed more than 12,000 people for about three weeks.Unconditional aid must be allowed to reach people in all the besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria, Marianne Gasser, the Red Cross chief in Syria, said in a statement.In London, the Red Cross president, Peter Maurer, offered a long list of ways that international law had been broken in Syria. Use of illegal weapons, and the illegal use of weapons, an epidemic of sieges, urban warfare destroying electricity and water infrastructure, deliberate attacks on schools and hospitals have accumulated into full system failure, forcing more than half of the Syrian population from their homes, Mr. Maurer said. Bombing civilians is a standard practice of warfare in Syria today, but that does not make it acceptable.Mr. Ban spoke of the prolonged, horrendous suffering of the Syrians, and said that at least half of the new aid pledged on Thursday would go to immediate, lifesaving activities. Other money, he said, would help enroll children in school, give refugees gainful employment and eventually rebuild devastated infrastructure.Under pressure from the West  and with the promise of financial incentives  the neighboring countries that have shouldered most of the refugee crisis agreed on Thursday to make it easier for displaced Syrians to find temporary jobs. Mr. Ban called the agreement a breakthrough and thanked Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey for choosing solidarity over fear.Those countries have also agreed to expand access to school for 1.7 million Syrian refugee children inside their borders. The United States pledged $325 million in development funding  including $290 million in new money  for school aid and repairs in Jordan and Lebanon."}
{"text": "Whether it is the billionaire Steven A. Cohens family office or a global bank, federal and state regulators are increasingly insisting on a monitor as part of the settlement of legal charges with firms.And now, two former federal prosecutors who trained under Mary Jo White, the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, are setting up their own firm to tap into the growing demand for such supervisors.The women behind the new firm, the Pallas Global Group, know a lot about this growing corner of the regulatory world. Bonnie Jonas was the deputy chief of the criminal division in the Southern District of New York, and Tiffany Moller was the assistant deputy commissioner and chief of compliance and oversight of the New York Police Department.For more than a year, Ms. Moller was charged with overseeing investigations into the use by the New York Police Department of tactics like the chokehold. The maneuver was banned by the department 20 years ago but has resurfaced as an issue once again after the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island. Ms. Moller also oversaw the adoption of new protocols and pilot programs for the department, like the wearing of video cameras by police officers.As a federal prosecutor, Ms. Jonas most recently led the criminal investigations of General Motors and Toyota, which both resulted in settlements with federal authorities. As part of the agreement, G.M. paid $900 million and Toyota $1.2 billion in penalties. Both companies also agreed to be subjected to independent monitoring of their safety practices, which have fallen under Ms. Jonass watch.In bigger, more complicated cases, those cases can only be resolved with an agreement that big companies are going to be reformed, said Richard B. Zabel, former deputy United States attorney in Manhattan who is general counsel at Elliott Management, a hedge fund. Unless you want a government official to sit inside the company, then you need a monitor, he added.Pallas Global will provide independent monitoring for companies across all industries as well as for government units like police departments, a growing area of focus amid a national debate over the use of police force. It will also conduct claims resolutions and provide administration services.The monitoring of Wall Street firms has become a particularly lucrative new area for former prosecutors, some of whom are also finding work in beefed up compliance departments at hedge funds. Mr. Cohen, whose former SAC Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading violations, has sought to fill his new firm, Point72, with former prosecutors and F.B.I. agents. It hired a former federal prosecutor, Vincent Tortorella, and Kevin J. OConnor, a former United States attorney for Connecticut.Ms. Jonas and Ms. Moller first met working under Ms. White, now chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the 1990s, during Ms. Whites tenure as a United States attorney.Before her 18 years of working in government, Ms. Jonas was a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind & Garrison. Ms. Moller was a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell and focused on criminal defense of large financial institutions.Weve been in the trenches, Ms. Moller said, adding that their experience will serve them well in a business that requires both investigative skills and the ability to be neutral.Across the corporate world, monitors are being used with increasing frequency as a means to get companies to reform practices deemed abusive or unfair by regulators.Tougher regulatory scrutiny after the 2008 financial crisis and changes to the law have forced many industries to spend more on compliance. Youre seeing an expansive use of monitors, Ms. Jonas said.Lawrence Byrne, deputy commissioner for legal matters at the New York Police Department, said there was a need for people like Ms. Moller and Ms. Jonas as the demand for monitors continued to grow. Speaking about Ms. Mollers compliance work at the New York Police Department, he said, She was essential in setting it up and creating the protocols and systems.As is often the case in the legal and regulatory world, Mr. Byrne also has direct knowledge of Ms. Jonass prosecutorial skills, having defended Royal Ahold in a case that was brought against its executives by Ms. Jonas and the S.E.C.In the hedge fund and private equity industry, firms have spent millions of dollars on new compliance measures to make sure they are not ensnared in the regulatory net. One of the best known monitors is Bart M. Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, who has served as an independent monitor in several government investigations, and at SAC Capital Advisors.Last month, Mr. Cohen reached a deal with the S.E.C. that will bar him from managing money for outside investors for two years. As part of the deal, Point72 will be subjected to examinations by the S.E.C. and will have to retain an independent monitor to watch its trading activities.It is unclear whether that position  a highly coveted one  is still open."}
{"text": "The top executive of the airline whose jetliner was damaged in an explosion shortly after takeoff from Somalia this week said on Thursday that investigators had found what appeared to be residue from explosives, though he cautioned that the findings were inconclusive. Still, the preliminary discovery lends weight to the possibility that a bomb was to blame for the blast that tore through the Airbus 321 shortly after takeoff from the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Theres a residue, theyre saying, of explosives, said the chief executive officer of Daallo Airlines, Mohammed Ibrahim Yassin, at the carriers corporate office in Dubai. But that cannot really make 100 percent that its a bomb, he added, saying that he expects initial findings to be released in a matter of days. The jet was carrying 74 passengers when the explosion struck. Somalias government confirmed Thursday that a passenger who had been missing since the explosion had died but gave no details. Residents in the town of Balad, about 18 miles north of Mogadishu, found the body of a man who may have been blown from the plane."}
{"text": "My father went with me to the used-car lot on a summer day before my senior year in high school. We paid $1,995, from savings left to me after my mothers death, for a 1994 Nissan Maxima.It was an odd shade of brown, with a thin gold stripe painted along the body, and it had a small exhaust leak, which made the engine loud. Still, it was mine.Almost immediately, the car had issues. The alarm went off whenever you unlocked the drivers door because of an electrical problem that, I was told, would cost almost as much to fix as I had paid for the car.This resulted in two solutions: Either I had to unlock the drivers door and quickly start the engine (to stop the blaring horn and flashing lights), or I would have to unlock the passenger-side door (which did not trigger the alarm) and climb toward the drivers seat.It was a typical high school car. It was imperfect, a bit of a wreck and I loved it.During the school year, Capital University, in Bexley, Ohio, recruited me to play soccer. At 17, with an offer from a college a few miles from my fathers house, I didnt really consider what it would be like to exist as black in a community that had managed to keep itself white.So in the late summer of 2001, before the start of my freshman year in college, I stepped onto the field for a preseason practice session as the first American-born player of color in the soccer programs history.By that time I had learned to deal with the Nissans quirks; I decided whether or not to endure the burst of the cars alarm depending on the area I was in. If I found myself in a place where my existence might raise suspicion, I chose the safer but more difficult route of going in through the passenger door.On a September night, eager to escape a house imprisoned by a thick cloud of body heat and drink, I skipped out of a college party and rushed to my car. I slid the key into the drivers door. But before turning it, I checked the street: the towering and expensive homes, the paved sidewalks, the darkness and silence.I opted for what my father would say was the smarter choice: I went in through the passenger-side door. The engine let out a rumble that cut through the suburban night. As I pulled away from the curb, I saw the flashing lights of a police car.I spend a lot of time trying to pinpoint how fear is learned. Or, rather, how we decide that fear is a necessary animal that grows out of our expectation to survive at all costs, and how I have been afraid and feared at the same time.When I reflect, I think the fact that I had gone 17 years without having developed a direct fear of the police meant that I was lucky.I knew the warnings from my father: Dont go on a run at night, dont reach into your pockets too quickly, be polite in front of them. And I had seen the police make life difficult for other people in my home neighborhood, and yet I never learned to be afraid.Until this early fall night in 2001, with its unseasonable cold, the Midwest wind like daggers.Bexley sits on the east side of Columbus. A small and flourishing mostly white suburb, it is sandwiched by two significantly poorer, mostly black neighborhoods. One of these is where I grew up.When you are asked to step out of a car that you own, your body no longer belongs to you, but instead to the lights drowning it. There are two sides of the night that you can end up on: one where you see the sunrise again and one where you do not. You may not consider this in the moment.That particular night, the police officers  first two, and then three more  were responding to a call of suspicious behavior. I was asked to exit my car before I was asked for ID. When I mentioned that this was my own vehicle, I was silenced and held by two officers while the others huddled around a squad car.When I was finally asked to produce ID, I reached into a pocket, only to remember that it was in the book bag I had left in the trunk. I moved to get it. Thats when I was grabbed and forcefully held down in the grass.People who had been watching out of windows now emerged from their homes. I wondered which one of them had called the police. I thought about my pants, a pair of new Old Navy jeans purchased with money I had gotten as a graduation gift, now stained with grass, and I thought about how much they had cost me.I thought about how much the car had cost me. How much it had cost me to get here, to Bexley, just five miles away from a neighborhood that no one from the nearby homes would venture to. But mostly I thought about how I perhaps owned nothing. Not even my hands, now pressed behind my back.I was eventually pulled up from the grass after what felt like hours, but must have been about five minutes. My car ransacked, my book bags contents scattered across the otherwise empty street.A police officer stared at my face, stared at my ID, and he mumbled: Interesting name. Sorry for the trouble.After the officers were gone, I sat on the curb and watched my hands shake. No one who lived in the nearby homes offered to help or asked if I was O.K.I didnt hate the police that night. Even today, while being critical of the institution of police and systems of policing, I feel no hatred toward the men and women themselves.I have had many interactions with police officers since then, some better, a few just as bad. But I go into each one expecting to fear and to be feared. And when I see the news of another unarmed persons death, I wonder how their stories began.If they began something like mine."}
{"text": "With the ailing 92-year-old Sumner M. Redstone in his final act as a media titan, the two rivals jousting over the future of his $40 billion entertainment empire repeatedly crisscrossed the country in the last several months to visit his mansion in a gated Beverly Hills enclave.Shari Redstone, the ostracized daughter who had been restricted from visiting until mid-October, celebrated the holidays with her father, played games and discussed the media business. Mr. Redstones grandchildren and two small great-grandchildren also visited. When not together, the father and daughter communicated via FaceTime, sometimes several times a day.Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom who formed a close bond with Mr. Redstone decades ago when he was a young corporate lawyer, also frequented the estate. The two discussed business, watched basketball and talked about films Mr. Redstone had recently screened.The backdrop to those visits was an epic fight for money, power and love from Mr. Redstone, the controlling shareholder in Viacom and CBS. It was a story line that some Hollywood executives deemed too implausible for a movie or television series.On Thursday, Mr. Dauman won that initial battle for control when Viacoms board of directors named him executive chairman, succeeding Mr. Redstone. Yet Ms. Redstone has made her wishes clear. She was the sole Viacom director to vote against Mr. Daumans nomination, and is opposed to having Mr. Dauman remain in charge.And so, the real fight has only just begun.Shari is going to continue to advocate for what she believes to be in the best interests of Viacom shareholders, Nancy Sterling, a spokeswoman for Ms. Redstone, said in a statement.Though he is now simply chairman emeritus at Viacom and CBS, where he also ceded his role as executive chairman, Mr. Redstone continues to hold about 80 percent of the voting stock in the two companies through National Amusements, the private theater chain company started by his father. He legendarily survived a fire in a Boston hotel when he was 55 years old, grasping onto a window ledge while sustaining serious burns. In the following decades, he emerged as one of the most tenacious moguls in the entertainment industry. His personal life also made headlines, with two marriages, a string of girlfriends and feuds with both his daughter and his now-estranged son.Upon Mr. Redstones death, his stake in National Amusements is to be held by an irrevocable trust created to benefit his five grandchildren. Voting control of that trust is to be passed on to seven trustees, among whom alliances are now being formed. The trust could support the two succession plans enacted this week by the boards of Viacom and CBS, but it also could act like an activist shareholder, contesting those decisions, installing a new board and leadership team or even making moves to sell the company.Ms. Redstone will have her own constituency on the trust, starting with herself and her adult son Tyler Korff. Leonard L. Lewin, the divorce lawyer for Sharis mother, Mr. Redstones wife of 52 years, is also a trustee. But Mr. Dauman is also a member of the trust, as is George S. Abrams, a Boston lawyer and a longtime Viacom director.The other trustees are David R. Andelman, a CBS director, and Norman I. Jacobs, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Redstone.Ms. Redstone, who controls the remaining 20 percent of National Amusements, has publicly feuded with her father over the years. In 2014, she declined a $1 billion buyout offer from her father for her stake in National Amusements, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. Though the terms of the trust state that she succeed her father as chairman at both CBS and Viacom, she has made clear that she does not intend to do so. But she also does not support Mr. Dauman in the role because of his position on the trust.Ms. Redstone is seeking a leader with an independent voice, she said in a statement on Wednesday.The appointment of Mr. Dauman as Viacoms executive chairman rankled some investors concerned about the companys performance. While both CBS and Viacom face challenges in a changing industry, Viacoms businesses  including the cable networks Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, and the Paramount movie studio  have had the more difficult path over the last year. Total revenue for the company declined 4 percent during the 2015 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. Profit was down about 20 percent during the period, when the company faced weak ratings and ad sales, and a lackluster film slate. Viacoms share price dropped nearly 45 percent during that fiscal year.Phillippe has six to nine months to deliver, and it is very hard to see how he can do that, said Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm Gamco is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS. They need someone with a creative dynamic. You cant have a lawyer who is a deal guy in the digital world.Even as Viacom has floundered, the board has endorsed Mr. Daumans leadership. His total compensation increased 22 percent to $54 million during the 2015 fiscal year, from $44 million the previous year. Excluding stock awards, Mr. Daumans pay decreased about 16 percent to $37 million.Viacom has said that it is turning the corner and has a plan for succeeding in the digital future, a stance the board seemed to affirm on Thursday. In choosing a successor to Sumner, the board considered the need for seasoned leadership in this time of unprecedented change, Philippes business experience and unparalleled knowledge of Viacom, and his long-term vision for the company, said William Schwartz, chairman of the governance and nominating committee of Viacoms board. We believe his becoming executive chairman is in the best interests of the company and all shareholders.Corporate governance at both Viacom and CBS has been the target of scrutiny by investors in recent months, prompted by a lawsuit filed in November by a former companion of Mr. Redstone, which challenged the media moguls mental capacity and depicted him as a living ghost.Manuela Herzer, a onetime romantic partner of Mr. Redstone, claimed that a confession of infidelity by a girlfriend half his age had set Mr. Redstone on a physical and mental downward spiral, unable to follow more than a brief conversation and requiring round-the-clock nursing care. The petition included salacious and embarrassing personal details about his physical condition and his sexual demands.Ms. Herzer said she was concerned about Mr. Redstones health care. His lawyers called the suit meritless and said she was after his money.Separately, a shareholder lawsuit has claimed that board members of Viacom and CBS were conflicted and put the interests of the Redstone family before those of the companies.As questions over corporate governance mounted over the last several weeks, the boards of both CBS and Viacom started setting succession plans into motion.On Tuesday, Mr. Redstone sent a letter to Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, and CBS directors announcing his resignation. The board subsequently met on Wednesday and nominated Mr. Moonves chairman. Ms. Redstone has voiced her support for Mr. Moonves.Viacoms board of directors discussed the chairmans role Thursday morning in a conference call, with Mr. Dauman participating from a long-planned vacation in St. Barts and Mr. Redstone calling from his estate. The board later announced it had consolidated power and control with Mr. Dauman, who has been chief executive of Viacom since September 2006.Pointing to examples of Mr. Redstones specific involvement with the company in the last year is difficult. He does not attend board meetings, but is said to listen over the telephone.Mr. Redstone was once a fixture at the red carpet premieres thrown by Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures, but his attendance fell off sharply about three years ago, and he is mostly sequestered at his mansion tucked between the canyons in the hills next to Bel Air.Nine months ago, a planned birthday party for him on the Paramount lot was canceled, with associates opting instead for a smaller gathering at a jazz club near his home. According to reports in Hollywood trade publications, Mr. Redstone entered and left through a side entrance, which was shielded from photographers with a portable black curtain.Its a little bit sad, said Frank J. Biondi Jr., who was chief executive of Viacom from 1987 to 1996. Everybodys day comes."}
{"text": "A recent post on the Motherlode blog gives parents advice for making their children less covetous and more sensible about money.Before you read the piece, how would you answer our question? How much does being able to buy things matter to you? Do you feel you understand the difference between wants and needs?In Six Steps to Curb Materialism in Your Kids, Ron Lieber writes about a pair of researchers who worked with a group of 71 families in which the children scored high (that is, badly) on a series of materialism tests. They then put some of these children through a series of drills, over several sessions, that included allowance tracking, a focus on giving, and continuing family conversations about the connection between money and values.  He writes: Six steps appear to be essential for any parent who wants to try to replicate the process at home.The first one is foundational: A regular allowance and a place to put it. The amount of the allowance doesnt matter so much, as it will depend on what expenses youre asking a child to pay for. As to where to put it, a few jars are fine, or you can use apps to track it electronically. Whats critical is dividing the money into three categories: spending, saving and giving. This, after all, is how most grownups begin to sort their financial lives, so it makes sense to set kids up this way.Family conversations about money are the next step. If youre tempted to tell children that financial matters are none of their business, please dont. Its not true, as your income and expenses impact them. Plus, talking about how you make these decisions will teach them plenty about tradeoffs. Use discussion cards like the ones Ive written about before if that helps or bring things up casually when you see an opening, but make these talks regular family events.The third step follows directly from the second and its to draw a clear line between wants and needs. Quite often this is a continuum or will depend on the category, as your family may live in a modest home but spend a lot on vacations and other experiences. Explain why. The process is healthy for adults too, particularly couples who bicker about spending and have not stopped to define precisely the things that are most important to them.Step four is keeping score, not just of what your children spend but what drives them to spend, save or give and how they feel about it afterward. Mr. Dungan and Dr. Kasser are both involved with the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, so they come with their own strong feelings about how marketers get inside childrens heads. Dr. Kasser and his sons sometimes watch television commercials just to spontaneously provide their own mocking scripts and commentary in real time.Students: Read the entire article, then tell us  Were you given an allowance growing up? Do your parents talk to you about financial matters, and the decisions they make around them? Have your parents or guardians every laid out the three categories  spending, saving and giving  that these experts recommend, or talked about the relationship between money and values in some other way? Do you tend to spend all your money, or do you save or give some? What do you feel you have learned from your family, your peers and your community about money in general? Do you think you are surrounded by materialism, or do you feel youve had a fairly solid grounding in the difference between wants and needs? How materialistic do you think you are? Has this changed as youve gotten older? Do you agree with the advice in this article? How would you like your parents to address money issues with you? Why?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. All comments are moderated by Learning Network staff members, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public."}
{"text": "When New York City paid $5,000 last year to settle a lawsuit by a man who was shot in the leg by police officers after he had threatened them with a machete, outrage came from all corners: police unions, newspaper editorials and even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who condemned the deal struck by his own Law Department.Our officers did everything right, the mayor said in a television interview last January. They were threatened with violence. How on earth could any lawyer, with a straight face, say we should pay money to the guy who had the machete?The settlement and the ensuing debate helped drive a new aggressive approach by the city in dealing with the roughly 3,000 lawsuits filed annually against the police.In the past year, officials said, the city has moved to improve the quality of the investigations into claims against officers: Police Commissioner William J. Bratton created a new 40-member legal unit that develops evidence that the Law Department can use to defend lawsuits against the police, and the department hired about 30 lawyers to bolster its litigation teams and to try more cases in court.Zachary W. Carter, the citys corporation counsel, said this week that the decision to settle lawsuits alleging police misconduct has always been based on an assessment of the evidentiary merit of each case. But the change that was the most stark, he said, was that in cases utterly lacking merit, we will not throw money at them just to make them go away.That approach, however, was tested by the $5,000 deal in the machete case, which was memorialized by a headline in The New York Post, Ax & You Shall Receive.The case stemmed from a 2010 altercation in Brooklyn, when two officers had responded to a call concerning a man who was carrying a machete. The officers ordered the man, Ruhim Ullah, to drop the weapon, but he ignored their commands and moved toward them in a threatening manner, and one officer shot him in the leg, the police said.Mr. Ullah pleaded guilty to menacing an officer.But his lawsuit, which sought $3 million in compensatory and punitive damages, claimed he had dropped the machete and ran when the officers arrived. The suit accused the police of falsely stating that he had threatened them with the weapon.I understand the other side sees it differently  thats why we have trials, Mr. Ullahs lawyer, Scott G. Cerbin, said. Its a case that got a lot of attention it really didnt warrant.Even before the deal in the machete case, Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Bratton and Mr. Carter were trying to address the high rate of settlements, said Lawrence Byrne, the Police Departments deputy commissioner for legal matters. But he added that the case highlighted for others within the administration that this was a problem that we had to fix.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, had declared that the city would not coddle these ambulance-chasing lawyers anymore. A deputy mayor, Anthony E. Shorris, wrote to presidents of police unions to inform them of the Law Departments new policies to improve the legal defense of officers. To ensure suits were not frivolous, his letter said, city lawyers would review sworn testimony of claimants and interviews of officers, steps that had not always been taken in the past, police officials and union lawyers said.Officers would also be promptly told of cases in which they were involved. No member of the department should ever be surprised to find a suit has been filed or settled against them, Mr. Shorris wrote.The letter also said that when the city found that a lawsuit utterly lacks merit, it would not be settled, even if an economic cost-benefit analysis suggests otherwise.In its first year of operation, Mr. Brattons new legal unit has assisted the Law Department in about 500 lawsuits, identifying and collecting evidence such as surveillance recordings and public information on the Internet, said Elizabeth M. Daitz, a department lawyer who leads the unit under Mr. Byrne.In one suit, for example, a man and a woman claimed false arrest and other civil rights violations stemming from a 2014 encounter at the Nostrand Avenue subway station in Brooklyn.They had been accused of entering without paying, an official said. They claimed in the lawsuit that they had been lawfully using the subway and that an officer had thrown them against a wall, used pepper spray in the mans face and punched the woman in the eye.While the suit was pending, Ms. Daitz said, the new unit, working through the departments transit officers, obtained a Metropolitan Transportation Authority surveillance video that showed the plaintiffs had entered without paying. The plaintiffs ultimately dropped the lawsuit, court records show. Their lawyer declined to comment.The unit has also obtained evidence in about 100 other cases in which no lawsuit has yet been filed, Ms. Daitz said.Reaction from some quarters to the citys approach has been cautiously optimistic.Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmens Benevolent Association, the union that represents more than 20,000 active officers, said that while the jury is still out, efforts by the de Blasio administration and Mr. Byrne were clearly a strong step in the right direction.Some police officials have been unusually candid in their criticism of how Mr. de Blasios predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, handled such cases.Mr. Byrne said in a recent interview that the Law Department was so in need of resources under Mayor Bloomberg that it often offered a settlement without fully investigating a case if a plaintiff accepted a so-called nuisance value deal  an amount the city calculated would cost less than taking the case to trial.Mr. Byrne said such deals were often made without any consultation with the Police Department or the officers being sued.Today, the taunt on the street is, Go ahead and arrest me because Im going to file my lawsuit and the citys going to give me money, Mr. Byrne said.Michael A. Cardozo, the former corporation counsel under Mr. Bloomberg, said Mr. Byrnes assertions were simply not correct. Mr. Cardozo denied that the Law Department during the Bloomberg administration had offered settlements without a satisfactory investigation into the merits of a case, or that there had been any formula by which the city would automatically agree to settle for certain amounts.Mr. Cardozo said settlement decisions were reached only after consultation with the Police Department, and after his lawyers had evaluated cases, including whether the plaintiff might win and what the damages might be.When this approach seemed to be encouraging more lawsuits, he said, his office refused to settle in a larger number of instances  even when the city might have had potential exposure to damages  and insisted on taking more cases to trial, with very positive results.Plaintiffs lawyers have seen the issue differently. Gabriel P. Harvis, a lawyer whose practice focuses on civil rights, said there was almost a moral imperative to look at potential cases and to bring all legally viable claims.Mr. Harvis, who once worked for the Law Department defending such cases, added, I think that the number of lawsuits that you see is much more of a barometer of the degree of police misconduct on the street than it is a measure of plaintiffs lawyers making a case where there isnt one."}
{"text": "Signac: Une vie au fil de leau\nFondation de lHermitage\nThrough May 22The French painter Paul Signac (1863-1935) began his career as a committed Impressionist, but an 1884 meeting with the pointillist painter Georges Seurat encouraged him to develop a more precise, scientific style.

{"text": "BAGHDAD   Night after night, Mohammed al-Jabiry tossed and turned in his bed at a refugee center in Finland, comparing life in Europe with life in Baghdad. After many sleepless nights, he decided to come home.In Iraq, I can find a girl to marry, Mr. Jabiry, 23, reasoned. And my mom is here.There were little things, too, that drove him to return, like the high price of cigarettes and the chillier weather. In Europe, I was isolated, he said. Life in Europe was not what we were expecting.Last year, beckoned by news reports of easy passage to Europe through Turkey, tens of thousands of Iraqis joined Syrians, Africans and Afghans in the great migrant wave to the Continent. Now, thousands of Iraqis are coming home.Many say they arrived in Europe with unrealistic expectations for quick success. Some also say the warm reception they received from Europeans last summer gave way to suspicion after the Paris terrorist attacks carried out by the Islamic State in November.Many Iraqis have stayed in Europe, of course, especially those who were displaced from lands controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. And others are still risking everything to cross the seas to get there. Last week, the bodies of five Iraqis who drowned in the Aegean Sea were returned to Kirkuk in northern Iraq.The returnees largely reflect another segment of migration: those who left Baghdad for economic reasons, or merely out of curiosity after seeing so many reports of migrants arriving joyously on the shores of Europe.When Mr. Jabiry left last summer, he said, I was thinking, I have no job here, and I never finished school. I thought of a better future there  that I would find a better job, that I could continue my studies, earn more money.He added: I was crying the first day I arrived in Finland. Crying of happiness.As the days stretched into months  time he said he mostly spent working out at the gym, or aimlessly hanging out with other Iraqis in the refugee center  he realized it would be a long time before he could get a job or a home of his own.Last summer, Facebook was filled with posts about making the trip. Now, some Iraqis in Europe are turning to social media to warn their countrymen away. One video posted recently shows an Iraqi man complaining of the food in Europe and saying, Im just waiting for my flight to Baghdad, and I will be back soon. I would advise everyone not to take the risk and come to Europe.The International Organization for Migration said it helped almost 3,500 Iraqis return home last year  just a portion of the overall number coming back, as many do so with the assistance of local governments or Iraqi Embassies in European countries.Since early 2016, requests for more assistance are increasing, said Thomas Weiss, the organizations chief of mission in Iraq.The Iraqi government recently sent a delegation to Europe to organize the return of Iraqis, and it may send chartered airplanes to bring them back.There are large numbers of Iraqi migrants who want to return from Europe, said Satar Nawrooz, the spokesman for Iraqs Ministry of Migration and Displacement. Some want to return for personal reasons, others because their applications for residency have been refused or because of the expensive living conditions. We are not able to count them all because a lot return on their own expense and not that of the ministry.Many of those returning to Iraq are also broke, having sold most of their belongings to pay smugglers to get them out of Turkey, on a dangerous sea voyage, to Greece.Our dream was to leave the country, said Haitham Abdulatif, 48, who sold his Mercedes for $8,000 to pay for the trip he took with his 10-year-old daughter. It was the talk everywhere  on TV, on social media.Mr. Abdulatif was an officer in Saddam Husseins army, but after the invasion by the United States in 2003, and the subsequent policy of de-Baathification, he was left without a pension. Then he was caught up in tragedy, like most Iraqis: Three brothers were killed during the sectarian civil war. But he has an aunt and cousin who live in the United States, and their stories motivated him to think of life elsewhere.They would always describe to me how living outside the country was different from living in Iraq, he said. They are comfortable. They are safe. There are job opportunities.He arrived in Belgium with this in mind: I was expecting them to give me a house, a good job, so I could have a better life. This is what I was dreaming about.The reality, he said, was much different. He quickly spent the $8,000 he brought, mostly paying smugglers, and found himself almost broke. He hated the food (milk and toast for breakfast, he said, and cheese sandwiches for lunch). And obtaining residency and finding a decent job would take months, he said. Finally, he went to the authorities and said, I want to go to Iraq.They were surprised, he said. But I told them Id rather die in my country than die outside in a strange country.Many Iraqis, too, did not count on the difficulty of landing in a liberal, European society from a conservative Arab culture.I felt like I couldnt live in an open society, said Aqeed Hassan, 26, who plays the clarinet and, back in Baghdad after going to Finland, is trying to get a job in a military band. My wife has her head covered, and I didnt feel like they liked Arabs.Still, Mr. Jabiry said that at first he was treated warmly, though also as a curiosity.In the early days when we arrived, the people were impressed with us, he said. They were taking pictures of us, inviting us into their homes. They liked our brown skin and our dark hair.After the attacks in Paris, though, many Europeans began to regard the migrants as a security threat.They turned their faces away from us, he said. I felt like the Finnish people really didnt want us anymore.He said he was not pushed to leave by the Finnish authorities, but he did notice signs that went up in the refugee center where he lived saying that Finland would pay for plane tickets to go home.Some Iraqis who returned had fond memories of their brush with European culture, and few regrets for trying a new life.It was very green and clean, Mr. Abdulatif said. It was beautiful. Even the peoples morals  they all respected us. Everyone said bonjour to me every morning.It was 99.9 percent different from Baghdad. People here all talk in a sectarian way: Hes Sunni, hes Shiite, hes Kurdish.He added: I now consider the journey as something that was fun. I dont regret it."}

{"text": "BEIJING  Chinas president, Xi Jinping, has already grasped more power more quickly than his two recent predecessors, and he has shown a taste for audacious decisions and a loathing for dissent. But a new push to praise him as Chinas core leader, a term resonant with the formidable stature once held by Deng Xiaoping, suggests that his steely quest for dominance is not over.As Mr. Xi confronts economic challenges and prepares to pick a fresh cohort of subordinates, he has demanded that Communist Party officials close ranks around him more tightly than ever, and references to Mr. Xi as the core leader have become a daily occurrence in Chinas state-run news media.Such sudden, unabashed references to Xis dominance in the leadership suggest he finally has turned the page on crushing the cabal of senior officials who opposed his ascension and remains a man in a hurry when it comes to fully consolidating his political power, said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.In the stagecraft of Chinese politics, formulaic expressions like core are tokens of power. Officials have suggested that hailing Mr. Xi as a leader of such stature  one in the footsteps of Deng, who ruled China through its transformation after Maos death  carries a warning not to question, let alone challenge, his authority as the government navigates turbulent changes.The world order that were in is undergoing a profound adjustment, and domestically, this is an important period of profound changes, Guo Jinlong, the party chief of Beijing, said at a meeting in mid-January, according to the Beijing Daily newspaper. We need a staunch leadership core more than ever.Mr. Xi, whose formal titles include general secretary of the Communist Party, has signaled his demands for greater loyalty through recent central leadership meetings, with the message filtering downward. Party and government, military, civilian and learning  east, west, south, north and center  the party is leader of all, Mr. Xi said at a meeting last month, according to a widely circulated report by a propaganda team devoted to promoting him.In a burst of statements since that meeting, dozens of provincial-level leaders and other senior cadres have vowed  and demanded from their subordinates  unflinching allegiance to General Secretary Xi Jinping, the core. Each day this week has brought new such declarations of allegiance to Mr. Xi in the state-run news media.Resolutely safeguard the core, General Secretary Xi Jinping, and implement to the letter all the decisions of the center, Xu Shousheng, the party secretary of Hunan Province in southern China, said on Monday, according to the provinces main news website.At least 14 party leaders of provinces, regions and provincial-level cities have used that phrase, or something nearly identical, since mid-January, according to a count from newspaper reports. Resolutely safeguard the absolute authority of the party center under Comrade Xi Jinping as general secretary, Chen Quanguo, the party secretary of Tibet, said on Wednesday. Staunchly safeguard, support and be faithful to General Secretary Xi Jinping, the core.Officials have not publicly explained what prompted the loyalty demands that Mr. Xi has authorized. But he faces a year of potentially contentious issues: subduing economic uncertainties that have eroded investors confidence in his acumen and continuing an anticorruption drive that has sapped officials incomes and morale.Mr. Xi has appeared frustrated by what he saw as foot-dragging and insubordination from local officials, said Mr. Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But he said that no evidence supported speculation that Mr. Xi faced concerted opposition from senior officials.On the contrary, Mr. Xis far-reaching reorganization of the Chinese military in recent months showed that he remained dominant, despite worries over the slowing economy, Mr. Johnson said.Mr. Xi also appears to be laying the groundwork for promoting loyalists, which will culminate in the partys next congress in 2017, said Joseph Fewsmith, a professor at Boston University who specializes in elite Chinese politics. Mr. Xi was installed as top leader at the last congress in 2012 and is likely to remain party leader until 2022.Despite Mr. Xis daunting power, he presides over a political elite that includes many appointees promoted by his predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin. The congress will give Mr. Xi a chance to install his own people, and he wanted to stress the importance he places on submitting to his goals, Professor Fewsmith said.I have always thought the game was about the 19th Party Congress, and I would say that this is the opening shot in the lead-up to that meeting, he said. It seems like a way to announce a campaign for personnel arrangements.Mr. Xi has not publicly said that he should receive the title of core leader, a designation that Deng bestowed on Mr. Jiang in the upheavals of 1989, after Mr. Jiang was abruptly installed as general secretary and struggled to establish his authority. Later, Deng himself and Mao also came to be praised as the core leaders of their generations.The term re-emerged after recent meetings presided over by Mr. Xi.On Jan. 7, the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member inner circle of party power run by Mr. Xi, demanded unwavering loyalty to the central leadership and to him, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency.The key to strengthening party leadership is maintaining the centralized and unified leadership of the party center, said the official summary in the state news media of a meeting in late January of the Politburo, a council of the partys 25 most senior cadres. It urged officials to support a staunch leadership core.Line up with the party center, line up with General Secretary Xi Jinping, multiple official accounts of the leaders demands have said, using a Chinese parade-ground term for troops arrayed in rigid uniformity.By contrast, Mr. Xis immediate predecessor as president and party chief, Mr. Hu, conspicuously never gained the title of core leader in party pronouncements. That was widely seen as reflecting Mr. Hus position as a relatively weak leader, long overshadowed by Mr. Jiang, who governed through consensus that critics said bred deadlock and corruption.Since coming to power in November 2012, Mr. Xi and his allies have implicitly presented their task as cleaning up the mess left by Mr. Hu: corruption, excessive industrial investment, pollution, social rancor and inequality, and incipient opposition to one-party rule.We must as soon as possible establish General Secretary Xi Jinpings core ability to govern this country as a benchmark, a model that leading officials of all ranks in the party can aspire to, said an adulatory party commentary about Mr. Xi that has been widely circulated by the Chinese news media. It made no mention of Deng, Mao or any other predecessors.Jin Zhong, the chief editor of a website in Hong Kong that focuses on Chinese politics, said by telephone that Mr. Xi appeared unchallengeable but remained wary of any potential rivals or cracks in his authority. The core title is a way to advertise his dominance, although it was too early to say whether the term would be included in official documents at the next party congress, Mr. Jin said.Hes been reconfiguring the patterns of Chinese politics to strengthen his position step by step, Mr. Jin said. The anticorruption campaign, taking control of law and order, reforming of the military, all have concentrated power, he said. This core expression is another step."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO   The N.F.L. said it may change its concussion protocol after coaches and officials mishandled St. Louis Rams quarterback Case Keenum, who was not removed from a game despite being disoriented after being knocked to the ground.Late in a game against the Baltimore Ravens in November, Keenum was knocked down, tried to get up, wobbled and fell back down. Dazed, he was helped to his feet by a teammate. The Rams trainer, Reggie Scott, ran onto the field to look atKeenum, who then stayed in the game. Scott was told by an official to leave the field or his team would be charged with a timeout, so he returned to the sideline. Two plays later, Keenum was sacked, and he fumbled.After the game, Keenum was found to have sustained a concussion, and he did not play in the next two games.Jeff Miller, the N.F.L.s senior vice president of health and safety policy, said that Keenum should have been removed from the game to see if he had a concussion.This demonstrated an area where there were definitely not best practices, he said.He added that the teams doctors and the leagues medical personnel would meet at the N.F.L. combine this month to discuss whether to alter the rules governing assessing concussions.Miller also said that the number of documented concussions increased by 31.6 percent, 271 in 2015 compared to 206 in 2014, partly because the number of players who were screened for concussions doubled. He also said that more players are self-reporting concussions.Thats a positive trend in terms of the culture change, he said."}

Trumps first advertisement since the Iowa caucuses lets a diverse group of Voters Speak.Uncharacteristically, Mr. Trump gives nearly half of this 30-second commercial over to the voices of other people. Then again, they are all enthralled by him. I came to hear Donald Trumps business plan for America, a black man says at the opening of the ad. Its really cool to hear him speak the truth, a younger white woman says over electronic dance music. Tells it like it is, says a young blonde.The ad for Mr. Trump, a candidate who has demonized illegal immigration, also makes a point of showing supporters who are not native English speakers. He wants to make America great, and thats what I want, too, says a young woman with a slight accent. As a guy whos an international student, Trump is speaking out the truth, says a young man, as the camera cuts to show him waving a campaign placard and giving a thumbs-up.Only midway through the ad is Mr. Trump heard from, as the soundscape takes on a syncopated, raucous feel: We have a country that were proud of, that we love, and that were not going to lose, he says as a packed, screaming crowd and his lectern, framed by five American flags, are shown from different angles. The roars swell and flags wave as Mr. Trump promises to make America great again.The positive tone is a striking shift for Mr. Trump, whose first ad played on fears of terrorism and illegal immigration, and whose most recent one was a vicious takedown of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Now, Mr. Trump lets his supporters speak for him, in part, and he does what he routinely demands that television reporters do at his rallies: Show the crowds.The ad makes no verifiable claims.New Hampshire broadcast and cable stations.After his second-place finish in Iowa, Mr. Trump in the new ad conveys a sense of broad support and confidence, with minorities featured prominently  a tacit acknowledgment that his Republican rivals have been portraying him as offensive to a variety of demographic groups."}

{"text": "At the National Prayer Breakfast, President Obama told the story of a group of Americans who were captured by the Nazis during World War II. The head of the German prison camp gave an order that the Jewish soldiers step forward. An American master sergeant, Roddie Edmonds, ordered all of his men to step forward. The Nazi held a gun to the sergeants head and said, These cant all be Jewish. The sergeant replied, We are all Jews. Rather than execute all of the men, the Nazi backed down.That kind of moral heroism took place in extraordinary circumstances. But even today there are moral heroes making sacrifices similar, if less celebrated, to the one that those soldiers were ready to make.Larissa MacFarquhars recent book, Strangers Drowning, is about such people. She writes about radical do-gooders. One of her subjects started a leper colony in India. One couple had two biological children and then adopted 20 more kids who needed a home. A women risked rape to serve as a nurse in war-torn Nicaragua. One couple lived on $12,000 a year so they could donate the additional money they earned annually, about $50,000, to charity.These people were often driven by moral rage and a need to be of pure service to the world. They tend to despise comfort and require a life that is difficult, ascetic and self-sacrificial. They yearn for the feeling that they are doing their utmost to relieve suffering. One abandoned a marriage to serve the poor.For these extreme do-gooders, MacFarquhar writes, it is always wartime. There are always sufferers somewhere in the world as urgently in need of rescue as victims of a battle. The do-gooders feel themselves conscripted to duty.Some radical do-gooders are what the philosopher Susan Wolf calls rational saints. It is their duty to reduce the sum total of suffering in the world, and the suffering of people halfway around the world is no different than the suffering of someone next door.Theres a philosophy question: If you were confronted with the choice between rescuing your mother from drowning or two strangers, who should you rescue? With utilitarian logic, the rational saint would rescue the two strangers because saving two lives is better than saving one. Their altruism is impartial, universal and self-denying. The evil in this world is the creation of those who make a distinction between the self and other, one man MacFarquhar writes about says.Others Wolf calls loving saints. They are good with others goodness, suffering in others pain. They are the ones holding the leper, talking to the potential suicide hour upon hour. Their service is radically personal, direct and not always pleasant.This sort of radical selflessness forces us to confront our own lives. Should we all be living lives with as much moral heroism as these people? Given the suffering in the world, are we called to drop everything and give it our all? Did you really need that $4 Frappuccino when that money could have gone to the poor?The argument against this sort of pure moral heroism is that fanaticism in the relief of suffering is still a form of fanaticism. It makes reciprocal relationships difficult, because one is always giving, never receiving. It can lead to a draconian asceticism that almost seems to invite unnecessary suffering.Love, by its nature, should be strongest when it is personal and intimate. To make love universal, to give no priority to the near over the far, is to denude love of its texture and warmth. It is really a way of avoiding love because you make yourself invulnerable.In an essay on Gandhi, George Orwell argued that the essence of being human is in the imperfect flux of life, not in the single-minded purity of sainthood. It is the shared beer, the lazy afternoon, the life of accepted imperfection. Full humanness is in having multiple messy commitments and pleasures, not one monistic duty that eclipses all else.In a 1982 essay called Moral Saints, Wolf argued that the desire to be supremely good can never be just one desire among many; it demotes and subsumes all the other desires. She wrote that a world in which everybody strove to achieve moral sainthood would probably contain less happiness than a world in which people realized a diversity of ideals involving a variety of personal and perfectionist values.As Andrew Kuper of LeapFrog Investments put it, sometimes you can do more good by buying that beautiful piece of furniture, putting somebody in Ghana to work.Yet I dont want to let us off the hook. Theres a continuum of moral radicalism. Most of us are too far on the comfortable end and too far from the altruistic one. It could be that you or I will only really feel fulfilled after a daring and concrete leap in the direction of moral radicalism."}

Parenteaus shootout goal lifted the Maple Leafs to a 3-2 win over the Devils on Thursday night, giving Toronto Coach Mike Babcock a reason to celebrate his 1,000th N.H.L. game.James Reimer stopped the Devils Reid Boucher, Jacob Josefson and Lee Stempniak in the shootout. Peter Holland and Tyler Bozak missed for the Leafs.David Schlemkos disputed third-period goal seemed destined to give the Devils a 2-1 win, but Bozak beat Keith Kinkaid with a snap shot from the slot with 2 minutes 6 seconds remaining to tie the game and set up the shootout. Bozaks 10th goal of the season ended his 15-game scoring drought dating to Dec. 27.The Maple Leafs challenged Schlemkos goal, a shot through traffic from inside the blue line at 6:27. They argued that Reimer had been interfered with as the Devils Jordin Tootoo, tangled up with defenseman Morgan Rielly, cruised past the net. But the goal stood.Babcock, who has collected 546 wins, is the 25th N.H.L. coach to reach the 1,000-game mark.Asked if he had another 1,000 games in him, Babcock, 52, referred to his contract with Toronto.Well, Ive got this year and seven more here, Babcock said. And then Im going to stay for two more because the teams going to be that good.It was a night of milestones for the Leafs. The captain Dion Phaneuf appeared in his 800th game, Joffrey Lupul played in his 700th, and Nazem Kadri was in his 300th. Toronto also commemorated the 40th anniversary of Darryl Sittlers 10-point night against the Boston Bruins.Josefson scored a first-period power-play goal for the Devils, and the rookie forward Joseph Blandisi had a strong game, assisting on Schlemkos goal for his fourth point in five games. The Devils had won five of their last six.I think it was a valuable point to gain tonight, Devils Coach John Hynes said. It was a tough, hard-fought game."}
{"text": "On paper, it sounds juicy: An ambitious lawyer (Josh Duhamel) finds himself caught in a power struggle between a corrupt pharmaceutical executive (Anthony Hopkins) and his firms senior partner (Al Pacino). When the case takes a deadly turn, he must race to uncover the truth before he loses everything.So reads the single-page handout for Misconduct that was distributed to reviewers in lieu of production notes. This clumsy, poorly written action thriller is such a complete catastrophe that you wonder how actors with the stature of Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Pacino were bamboozled into appearing in it. As for Mr. Duhamel, this human vanilla milkshake seems totally lost in a movie that requires him to be more than a generic nice guy with a pretty face.Misconduct is the directorial debut of Shintaro Shimosawa, the producer of The Grudge and The Grudge 2, from a screenplay by Simon Boyes and Adam Mason, a filmmaking team behind low-budget horror movies of which youve probably never heard. It begins as a whistle-blower drama about a young lawyer determined to expose and prosecute the crimes of Mr. Hopkinss evil plutocrat.From there it goes haywire and becomes a laughably inept, crazily edited, incomprehensible, suspense-free thriller, one of whose villains repeatedly runs people down with a motorcycle. Malin Akerman, as the plutocrats scheming girlfriend, wildly overacts the role of a film noir temptress. Alice Eve plays the lawyers depressed wife as a pouting, one-note baby doll.Except for Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Pacino, going through their familiar paces, incompetent is the word.Misconduct is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for  foul language, violence and some nudity.

{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Hillary Clinton appeared frustrated.Dozens of prominent economists and academic experts have endorsed her plans to regulate the financial sector. Her policies would try to prevent the problems of the future, she explained in Thursdays debate, in addition to reining in the excesses of Wall Street.So why do so many voters not believe it?Throughout the debate, Mrs. Clinton found herself cornered by Senator Bernie Sanders and the moderators about her ties to Wall Street, the political contributions that have bolstered her campaign account, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars in paid speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs and other financial firms in the months after she left the State Department.Mrs. Clinton tried again and again to explain that her plans for Wall Street would be tougher and go further than Mr. Sanderss proposals by also regulating the shadow banking industry, the insurance companies and other wrongdoers.I have a broader view, Mrs. Clinton said, contrasting her plan to that of Mr. Sanders, whose anti-Wall Street message has turned him from a long-shot candidate to a serious contender for the Democratic nomination.If all we are going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one street in our economy, were missing the big oil companies, were missing the other big energy companies, Mrs. Clinton said. Were missing the big picture.The response provided a perfect opening for her populist opponent. Madam Secretary, it is not one street, Mr. Sanders said. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.In an election year fueled by the anger over the growing gap between rich and poor, Mrs. Clinton, who is widely viewed as too close to the financial sector, seems an imperfect messenger for change. She has developed sophisticated policy proposals that many economists agree would aggressively regulate the financial sector, but they have collided with the image that Sanders supporters and other political rivals have painted of her: Wall Streets friend and defender.Look at my record, Mrs. Clinton said throughout the night. I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist and I will continue to do that.I went to Wall Street before the crash, she said, recalling the warning she said she delivered to the executives in the room. I was the one saying, Youre going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.Despite her husbands record of deregulation and trade deals, Mrs. Clinton has been ahead of much of the Democratic Party in identifying economic headwinds and proposing restrictions to try to deal with them.In her 2008 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton ran to the left of Barack Obama, angering some of her Wall Street donors with a 2007 speech in which she called for eliminating the so-called carried interest loophole, rolling back the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthy, placing limits on chief executives compensation and imposing tighter regulations on derivatives. Lets finally do something about the growing inequality that is tearing our country apart, Mrs. Clinton said in June 2007 at a Take Back America gathering of liberal groups.Years before Mr. Sanderss message of alleviating economic inequality thrust him onto the national stage, Mrs. Clinton said in the 2007 speech, the top 1 percent of our households held 22 percent of our nations wealth.But that was before the financial crises and the anger that Americans harbor because the players involved were never punished.By the time Mrs. Clinton emerged from the State Department in 2013 and, like many former cabinet officials, cashed in on the paid speaking circuit, something was stirring in the American electorate. A disaffection and disgust had sprung Occupy Wall Street on one side of the political spectrum and the Tea Party on the other. And in the middle of it was Mrs. Clinton delivering upbeat bromides about her time as the nations top diplomat to Goldman Sachs executives for $675,000 for three speeches. You cant win if you dont show up, she said in her standard script for paid speeches. Leadership is a team sport.Asked by CNN on Wednesday night why she accepted such a high fee, Mrs. Clinton seemed unable to fully respond. Thats what they offered, she said uncomfortably.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton expanded on her paid speechmaking, saying she also spoke to other groups, like heart surgeons and camp counselors. But again, she seemed to struggle, this time when pressed by the moderators if she would release the transcripts of all of her paid speeches.I will look into it, she said. I dont know the status, but I will certainly look into it.For Mrs. Clinton, the key question should not be whether she received generous checks from Wall Street, but whether she did their bidding in return. At one point, she challenged her opponent to identify even one example of how her Wall Street contributions or paid speaking fees resulted in a favor from her, calling the implication an artful smear by Mr. Sanders. If youve got something to say, say it directly, but you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received, Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders, eager to avoid suggestions that he is making personal or gendered attacks on Mrs. Clinton, did not bother to directly answer the question. As is his custom, returned to his old refrain: Wall Street is too big, too powerful, and no one in their right mind believes they contribute to politicians out of the goodness of their hearts. That is what power is about, he said.But almost instantaneously, his campaign blasted out a fact check to the news media that included an excerpt from Senator Elizabeth Warrens 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap, in which she accused Mrs. Clinton of shifting her position on bankruptcy legislation when she became a New York senator to appease her Wall Street donors, a charge Mrs. Clinton has denied. She could not afford such a principled position, Ms. Warren wrote. Campaigns cost money and that money wasnt coming from families in financial trouble."}
{"text": "LONDON  Benjamin Millepied, the choreographer and former New York City Ballet dancer who brought an aura of glamour and intense news media visibility to the 335-year-old Paris Opera Ballet as its director of dance, said on Thursday that he was resigning after just over a year in the position.The French-born Mr. Millepied, who achieved fame beyond the ballet world when he met his wife, the actress Natalie Portman, while working on the film Black Swan, said in an interview that he wanted to return to Los Angeles, where the couple lived before moving to Paris in 2014. Mr. Millepied, 38, said that he had decided to focus on his own choreography and on a small contemporary dance ensemble he founded four years ago, but his discontent with aspects of his role in Paris has been well documented over the last few months.The former Paris Opera toile Aurlie Dupont, 43, who retired last year, will become the new director when Mr. Millepied leaves on July 15.In interviews with Le Figaro and in a documentary, Relve, broadcast on the French television channel Canal Plus, he spoke of his dislike for the rigid hierarchical system of grading and promotion at the Opera; his dissatisfaction with the training at the Paris Opera Ballet School, which is the near-exclusive source of dancers for the company; and the need for the company to be more racially diverse.In a statement, Frances culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, who is in Los Angeles promoting the French film industry, thanked Mr. Millepied and said, I would like to applaud his commitment to diversity, which I share.In a sideways blow to the notion, often stated as fact in the French news media, that the Paris Opera Ballet is the best company in the world, Mr. Millepied said in the documentary that he was not yet satisfied with the quality of its dancing in the classics. Im waiting to see real excellence, he said, adding, Its not the best classical troupe, but it might be the best contemporary company in the world.In taking on one of the most storied and tradition-bound troupes in the world, Mr. Millepied shook things up quickly. In an opening coup, he secured a major dance world figure, William Forsythe, as the companys associate choreographer, who has also been involved in a newly conceived Academy, a training program to develop choreographers, musicians, stage directors and singers.In an email, Mr. Forsythe said that his contract was for one year, and that he would leave after Mr. Millepieds departure. Ballet companies change, established institutions tend not to, he wrote.BIn September, Mr. Millepied initiated a digital platform for new work called 3e Scne, or 3rd Stage, which has 22 films on show, and he has been behind an aggressive social media presence for the company. He has also drawn international interest and his fund-raising capacities to the Opera; the Ballets celebrity-filled opening-night gala in September raised more than 1 million euros, or $1.1 million, and he has raised considerably more from corporate and private donors.In his first season, Mr. Millepied commissioned pieces from Mr. Forsythe (who has not created a large-scale ballet for a company other than his own since 1999) and other prominent international choreographers, including Justin Peck, Wayne McGregor and Jrme Bel. He also won plaudits for the improved quality of the companys dancing.The Paris Opera Ballet is under new management: Benjamin Millepied became its artistic director in 2014, and this is the first season in which he has chosen the repertory, Alastair Macaulay, chief dance critic for The New York Times, wrote in December. Its fair to hope hes responsible for these fresh qualities of style.Mr. Millepieds departure will be a blow to the Operas image, and to the much-vaunted new era of collaboration between opera and ballet heralded by Stphane Lissner, the general director of the Opera.Mr. Lissner, who hired Mr. Millepied in January 2013  and who has final authority on decisions about budget, hiring and promotion  said at a news conference at the Palais Garnier on Thursday that he had no regrets about that choice. He leaves too soon, but others leave too late. He added, I think that the two jobs, director of dance and a choreographer who is more and more in demand, not just at the Opera, raised a certain number of questions.In a telephone interview, Mr. Bel, who has a new work opening at the house on Friday, said that he had accepted a commission from Mr. Millepied because he believed in his ideas about reforming the institution. It interests me a great deal to see how the Opera dancers integrate, in body and spirit, ideas that they cant even begin to question. Its a monarchical order, not a democratic system where issues can be raised. Mr. Bel added that a text that he had written for the program, in which he spoke about these issues, was not used. I didnt really mind, but I do think that if one doesnt allow criticism, one doesnt advance.Rumors of Mr. Millepieds departure surfaced on Wednesday in a report in the French newsmagazine Paris Match and rapidly sent shock waves through the French news media.Mr. Millepied, an established choreographer who has created four pieces for the Paris Opera, said in the phone interview that he was leaving to focus on his own work. I want to regain my freedom and I want to create, he said. Ive been honored to be given the opportunity to work at the Opera and with the dancers, but this job, as it exists today, is not something I want.He said that despite rumors that Ms. Portman was unhappy in Paris, the decision to leave was entirely his own. It is not true that Natalie wanted to go, he said. She has been entirely supportive of what I wanted to do.He said that they would return to Los Angeles, where he planned to turn the L.A. Dance Project into a larger company that would include ballet in its repertory.I want to fully build my vision for a dance company of our time, to respond to cultural challenges, building audiences and making dance more popular, he said. Its time to redefine what a dance organization is today.His new ballet, La Nuit sAchve, will have its premiere on Friday at the Palais Garnier on a mixed bill. He has two ballets scheduled for the 2016-17 season, scheduled to be announced on Wednesday."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Heres how we analyzed the fifth Democratic debate, and our live fact checks._____Hillary Clinton has been speaking in public for decades. But in recent days, political observers have called her voice loud, flat, harassing to the ear. They have said she has a decidedly grating pitch and punishing tone and called her shrill.I think a lot of it with Hillary Clinton has to do with style and delivery, oddly enough, said Bob Woodward, the veteran Washington Post editor, on MSNBC on Wednesday. She shouts, he said, adding that there was something unrelaxed about the way she is communicating.Mrs. Clinton, who admits she does not have the natural oratory skills of her husband or President Obama, has been tailoring her voice and tone for years. But only in recent days has her speaking style been thrust back into a heated debate about women, sexism and public speaking.Mrs. Clintons allies berated Mr. Woodward for what they viewed as a gender-based critique of her impassioned tone on the campaign trail, pointing out that the stock in trade of her Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were his rousing remarks delivered in forceful tones.It is 2016 and I cannot believe  cannot believe  we are having this conversation, said Stephanie Schriock, the president of the group Emilys List, which works to elect female candidates, in an interview. If Mrs. Clinton is shouting, what is Bernie Sanders doing? she asked.Even Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor whose 2004 campaign became immortalized by a widely mocked scream, said the criticism of Mrs. Clinton was sexist. If she were a male and she were making these kinds of speeches, would people be criticizing her? Mr. Dean said on Fox News.Mrs. Clinton can be partly credited for igniting the debate.After the first Democratic debate in October, when Mr. Sanders said all the shouting in the world would not fix the countrys problems with gun control, Mrs. Clinton said, sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think its shouting. The campaign later blasted out that line on Facebook and in fund-raising emails to excite female voters.Asked Thursday about Mr. Woodwards comments to MSNBC, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, directed a reporter to the outraged response on social media from many women.In todays America, when a woman is loud its shouting, when a man yells = enthusiasm. Where am I? Sudan? Joyce Karam, the Washington bureau chief at the Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, wrote on Twitter.In general, Mr. Fallon said, that type of criticism gets leveled at women more than it does at men.Privately, even Mrs. Clintons friends and supporters say that lately she does seem to be raising her voice more than usual. The tonal shift came in the waning days of the Iowa caucuses, when Mrs. Clinton displayed a fire-in-the-belly determination on the campaign trail that helped her eke a victory against Mr. Sanders.It is partly a reflection of the changing nature of Mrs. Clintons events. She devoted the early months of her candidacy to speaking to a handful of voters in round-table discussions, and then shifted to larger town-hall-style events where she took questions and nodded intently as voters asked her about issues like Social Security and climate change.As the voting in Iowa neared, Mrs. Clinton held larger rallies, drawing hundreds of supporters who chanted and waved her Fighting for Us campaign signs. And because Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady, believes in the importance of 12-point plans, rather than sweeping campaign promises, she often raises her voice when mentioning arcane policy points, which can seem jarring to people unfamiliar with her delivery.Its called an inversion, but I call it a perversion! is one of Mrs. Clintons favorite lines, referring to the complicated loophole that allows corporations to avoid paying taxes.And Im going to invest in infrastructure! she often says, lifting her vocal reach as she promises to rebuild roads and bridges and construct high-speed railways.She grows forceful when emphasizing that the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory legislation includes a provision to break up the big banks, something Mr. Sanders has called for through reinstating the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. Folks, we already have the authority in Dodd-Frank, Mrs. Clinton says, bringing her voice back down to a near whisper.In settings such as a forum on CNN on Wednesday and in the Democratic debates, Mrs. Clinton seems comfortable, able to string together paragraphs of complex policy talk off the cuff. But that does not always come through when she speaks to large groups, public speaking experts said.Theres a lot of wisdom to the old adage that you almost garner more attention when you whisper, said Terri Sjodin, a public speaking consultant based in Newport Beach, Calif. But theres an adrenaline that gets high when youre in a large venue, an auditorium, and a natural tendency to shout or get louder.In some ways, the debate over Mrs. Clintons speaking style is a reflection of the larger phenomenon of her candidacy  and that she is the first woman to have a serious shot at becoming a major political partys presidential nominee.Some research suggests women can be competent or likable, but not both, said Denise Graveline, a former aide in the Clinton administration and the author of The Eloquent Womans Guide to Moderating Panels. She pointed to the 1984 election, when Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice-presidential candidate, struggled to find the right tenor.Ms. Ferraro lacked the credibility of a male candidate, adopted a stronger, more masculine style that may have suited her less, Ms. Graveline said.The tendency to yell on the campaign stump is not gender specific, but the public is much less accustomed to hearing a womans voice in such settings, said Ruth Sherman, a public speaking coach who advises chief executives and celebrities.Youve got a whole generation of new voters who have never heard her in this way before, Ms. Sherman said of Mrs. Clinton.But, she added, the former secretary of state, like many public figures male and female, could afford to work on her delivery.She tends to substitute volume for expression, Ms. Sherman said."}
{"text": "Lawyers struggle with substance abuse, particularly drinking, and with depression and anxiety more commonly than some other professionals, according to a new study conducted by the American Bar Association together with the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.One in three practicing lawyers are problem drinkers, based on the volume and frequency of alcohol consumed, 28 percent suffer from depression, and 19 percent show symptoms of anxiety, according to the study, which involved 12,825 licensed, employed lawyers in 19 states around the country.The studys conclusions were based on the lawyers anonymous responses to a questionnaire, in which they were asked to characterize their alcohol use and mental health. Problem drinking was defined as hazardous, harmful and potentially alcohol-dependent drinking.The lawyers represented a small sampling of the more than one million lawyers estimated to be practicing in the United States.The study, The Prevalence of Substance Use and Other Mental Health Concerns Among American Attorneys, appears in the February edition of the Journal of Addiction Medicine.Problem drinking by lawyers was notably higher than the 15 percent of surgeons who were categorized as abusing alcohol, as reported in a 2012 study of nearly 7,200 surgeons by the American College of Surgeons.Over all, a study in 2014 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that 6.8 percent of Americans over 18 had alcohol use disorders.Lawyers working in law firms had the highest rates of alcohol abuse, according to the studys findings. Junior associates reported the highest rate of problem drinking. Senior associates and junior partners followed.That might point to the cultural nature of problem drinking, said Patrick R. Krill, a co-author of the study and a lawyer who runs Hazeldens substance-abuse treatment program for lawyers and judges.When youre at a law firm, youre inculcated into that culture, with these coping mechanisms. Problem drinking is normalized within many law firms, he noted. In addition, firm lawyers are encouraged to socialize with clients, which can often involve alcohol, he added.The study is the first wide-ranging look at lawyer substance abuse issues in approximately 25 years. In 1990, researchers interviewed about 1,200 lawyers in Washington State, where they found nearly 18 percent of lawyers were problem drinkers and about the same percentage suffered from depression.Any way you look at it, this data is very alarming, and paints a picture of an unsustainable professional culture thats harming too many people, Mr. Krill said.Among the findings is that lawyers with 10 or fewer years of experience had much higher rates of alcohol abuse than their more senior colleagues. This contrasts with the 1990 studys findings that substance abuse increased with years spent in the profession.According to the latest study, almost 29 percent in their first decade of practice were found to be problem drinkers. In the next decade, between 11 and 20 years, the percentage dropped to 21 percent.For many, frequent drinking began in law school, but a far greater number  44 percent  said problem drinking began during their first 15 years of practice, leading the report to conclude that being in the early stages of ones legal career is strongly correlated with a high risk of developing an alcohol use disorder.The report does not trace the origins of the problem, but young lawyers are under serious stress as they face weighty student debt, often over $100,000, and the difficulty of finding a job in the shrinking entry-level job market.This new research demonstrates how the pressures felt by many lawyers manifest in health risks, said Paulette Brown, the president of the American Bar Association. She said the findings provide an important guide for the associations lawyer assistance programs to help practitioners address the mental health risks.Based on the studys findings, that assistance should come in the first decade of the lawyers career, said Mr. Krill."}
{"text": "Ted Cruz had a teachable moment in Iowa, although he himself will learn nothing from it. A voter told Mr. Cruz the story of his brother-in-law, a barber who had never been able to afford health insurance. He finally got insurance thanks to Obamacare  and discovered that it was too late. He had terminal cancer, and nothing could be done.The voter asked how the candidate would replace the law that might have saved his brother-in-law if it had been in effect earlier. Needless to say, all he got was boilerplate about government regulations and the usual false claims that Obamacare has destroyed millions of jobs and caused premiums to skyrocket.For the record, job growth since the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect has been the best since the 1990s, and health costs have risen much more slowly than before.So Mr. Cruz has a truth problem. But what else can we learn from this encounter? That the Affordable Care Act is already doing enormous good. It came too late to save one mans life, but it will surely save many others. Why, then, do we hear not just conservatives but also many progressives trashing President Obamas biggest policy achievement?Part of the answer is that Bernie Sanders has chosen to make re-litigating reform, and trying for single-payer, a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. So some Sanders supporters have taken to attacking Obamacare as a failed system.We saw something similar back in 2008, when some Obama supporters temporarily became bitter opponents of the individual mandate  the requirement that everyone buy insurance  which Hillary Clinton supported but Mr. Obama opposed. (Once in office, he in effect conceded that she had been right, and included the mandate in his initiative.)But the truth is, Mr. Sanders is just amplifying left-wing critiques of health reform that were already out there. And some of these critiques have merit. Others dont.Lets start with the good critiques, which involve coverage and cost.The number of uninsured Americans has dropped sharply, especially in states that have tried to make the law work. But millions are still uncovered, and in some cases high deductibles make coverage less useful than it should be.This isnt inherent in a non-single-payer system: Other countries with Obamacare-type systems, like the Netherlands and Switzerland, do have near-universal coverage even though they rely on private insurers. But Obamacare as currently constituted doesnt seem likely to get there, perhaps because its somewhat underfunded.Meanwhile, although cost control is looking better than even reform advocates expected, Americas health care remains much more expensive than anyone elses.So yes, there are real issues with Obamacare. The question is how to address those issues in a politically feasible way.But a lot of what I hear from the left is not so much a complaint about how the reform falls short as outrage that private insurers get to play any role. The idea seems to be that any role for the profit motive taints the whole effort.That is, however, a really bad critique. Yes, Obamacare did preserve private insurance  mainly to avoid big, politically risky changes for Americans who already had good insurance, but also to buy support or at least quiescence from the insurance industry. But the fact that some insurers are making money from reform (and their profits are not, by the way, all that large) isnt a reason to oppose that reform. The point is to help the uninsured, not to punish or demonize insurance companies.And speaking of demonization: One unpleasant, ugly side of this debate has been the tendency of some Sanders supporters, and sometimes the campaign itself, to suggest that anyone raising questions about the senators proposals must be a corrupt tool of vested interests.Recently Kenneth Thorpe, a respected health policy expert and a longtime supporter of reform, tried to put numbers on the Sanders plan, and concluded that it would cost substantially more than the campaign says. He may or may not be right, although most of the health wonks I know have reached similar conclusions.But the campaigns policy director immediately attacked Mr. Thorpes integrity: Its coming from a gentleman that worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Its exactly what you would expect somebody who worked for B.C.B.S. to come up with. Oh, boy.And lets be clear: This kind of thing can do real harm. The truth is that whomever the Democrats nominate, the general election is mainly going to be a referendum on whether we preserve the real if incomplete progress weve made on health, financial reform and the environment. The last thing progressives should be doing is trash-talking that progress and impugning the motives of people who are fundamentally on their side."}
{"text": "SATURDAY PUZZLE  Quite a lot of fresh entries today, courtesy of David Steinberg.Im always fascinated by common entries that were popular at another time, but are making their New York Times debut now, like ACID WASH, the popular denim style of the 1970s, which came back in the 90s and which may be making a re-appearance once again. I sense a fashion pattern here. And who would think that the ubiquitous MADE IN CHINA would be appearing here for the first time? MCAFEE has appeared just twice before, but in the 1940s as Mildred MCAFEE, the Director of the Naval WAVES during World War II.But we also have the relatively new SELFIE STICK and ROSE CEREMONY. Other debuts today include LONGING EYES, DRUG WARS, the cheerful HOWS LIFE, SERIES FINALE, GAINS ON and MOON ROOF.Clue of the Day for me was Battery device? for RAM (as in battering RAM).Lets hear from Mr. Steinberg:Short note this time since school is keeping me busy.I constructed this crossword fairly recently (April 2015), so Im pleasantly surprised to see it come out so fast!  My seed entry for the center stack was SELFIE STICK.  At the time I constructed the puzzle, I was almost certain that another Times constructor would beat me to SELFIE STICK, but I somehow ended up being the first to use it.  I find this kind of ironic because I hardly ever take selfiesin fact, my Instagram would probably be completely blank if one of my friends hadnt cajoled me to post some pictures.  I dont personally own a selfie stick, and my roommates broke so quickly that Im not particularly inclined to purchase one.  The struggle of college life is real!Anyway, other entries Im especially proud of in this one are MADE IN CHINA, ROSE CEREMONY (which is especially timely), ACID WASH, MOON ROOF, HOWS LIFE and BRING IT.  I wasnt thrilled with the LE BON/RABIN crossing, but Im hoping that Saturday solvers will know one or the other.I hope you enjoy my puzzle!Thank you, Mr. Steinberg.A decent SERIES FINALE wraps up narratives that were left untold and closes loopholes. But the best of them leave you hanging. This one is the best, as far as Im concerned. Unfortunately, the original scene cant be embedded, but heres the annotated version from Vox:Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "In the constant scorekeeping of where techs power centers are, two trends stand out in Asia: the continued rise of China as a tech titan and the slow decline of Japans once-mighty tech industry.Those currents were evident in two recent developments.On Thursday, Paul Mozur and Jane Perlez reported that American officials had blocked a proposed purchase of a controlling stake in a unit of the Dutch electronics company Philips by Chinese investors because the United States was fearful the deal would be used to further Chinas push into microchips.At the center of the concerns was a material called gallium nitride, which was being used by the Philips unit in light-emitting diodes, but which has applications for military and space and can be helpful in semiconductors. The report illustrated how American officials have come to view Chinas large and growing tech industry with misgivings.At the same time, Jonathan Soble and Paul Mozur reported that Sharp, one of Japans large consumer electronics companies and the biggest LCD producer, was leaning toward a takeover offer from the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn. The news underlined the decline of Japans once-famed consumer electronics companies, which have been undercut in recent years by lower-cost competition from China and South Korea."}
{"text": "LONDON  Royal Dutch Shell became the latest big energy company to file a damage report on the impact of depressed oil prices, saying on Thursday that its adjusted profit fell 56 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a year earlier.But the companys stock rose about 5 percent in Amsterdam trading, as Shell said it would maintain its dividend, paying out at least $1.88 a share for 2016.Promising to continue to pay dividends, which some other big petroleum companies have also pledged to do, is one of the few ways to reward investors during the industrys lean times  although some analysts question how long the payouts can be sustained if oil prices continue to languish.Shell said earnings adjusted for inventory changes were $1.8 billion, down sharply from $4.2 billion in the comparable period of 2014.For all of 2015, its earnings fell 80 percent to $3.84 billion, compared with $19 billion in 2014.On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Ben van Beurden, Shells chief executive, said that the pending acquisition of the British oil and gas producer BG Group, which is expected to be completed in a few weeks, would be an opportunity to further streamline Shells operations as it adapts to the changing energy industry.Mr. van Beurden said that Shell had already cut about 7,500 full-time and contractor positions and that an additional 2,800 jobs would be eliminated from the two companies after the merger. He also promised impactful decisions on matters like capital spending.In an immediate move to preserve capital, Shell said it would postpone two major projects: a liquefied natural gas operation in Canada and a deepwater oil and gas development off Nigeria.We are making substantial changes in the company,  Mr. van Beurden said, as we refocus Shell and respond to lower oil prices.Shells diminished earnings came as ConocoPhillips, the third largest American oil company, announced that it was slashing its dividend by two-thirds, and that it posted a $3.5 billion loss in the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $39 million the year before.ConocoPhillips is the largest American oil company so far to cut its dividend, in another sign of extreme stress, which has already led to scores of bankruptcies of smaller companies.Low prices for oil and natural gas were responsible for a drop in ConocoPhillips revenues of 42 percent to $6.8 billion. The company also wrote down the value of its oil properties and exploration assets by $2.2 billion.Since it spun off its refineries more than three years ago, the company no longer receives any benefits for lower oil and natural gas prices, which make refining more profitable.While we dont know how far commodity prices will fall or the duration of the downturn, said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillipss chief executive in a statement, we believe its prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time.Chevron last week reported its first quarterly loss since 2002. BP on Tuesday reported a $3.3 billion fourth-quarter loss. Exxon Mobil on that same day said that its profit for the quarter had declined 58 percent.For Shell, despite the cushioning effects of its large refining and chemicals business, the falling prices of oil and gas are still doing damage. Each $10 a barrel change in the oil price, the company says, has an impact of about $3.3 billion on annual earnings.Shell had forecast gloomy earnings two weeks ago, before the vote by shareholders on the proposed acquisition of BG. A few days later, investors approved the acquisition.Shell estimated on Thursday that its reserves of oil and gas still in the ground and under the sea floor, fell by 1.4 billion barrels in the past year, to 11.7 billion barrels, as falling prices had prompted the company to remove some of them from its books.To assure future operations, oil companies need to add to their reserves to replace production. That is one reason Shell has been intent on acquiring BG Group, which would add an estimated 3.6 billion barrels of reserves.Shell produced 1.1 billion barrels in 2015.With petroleum prices down about 70 percent over the last 18 months, the oil industry is experiencing its most brutal downturn since the late 1990s. That period, a time of widespread job losses among oil companies, was a time of industry consolidation, as BP acquired Amoco and Exxon merged with Mobil.Back then, Shell stayed on the deal-making sidelines. But during the current downturn, the company has been the only big oil company to make a bold move in buying BG Groupfor cash and shares now worth about $50 billion.That deal proved divisive with investors, some of whom worried about Shell making a large takeover at a time when oil prices were still on the way down.Mr. van Beurden has long tried to persuade investors that the BG acquisition is not an expensive gamble but rather an opportunity to choose the best of both companies and to cut jobs and expenses like exploration. BG will also raise Shells status as Europes largest oil and gas company. But that distinction may be difficult to celebrate at a time of falling fuel prices.Big oil companies have responded to plummeting prices by cutting capital spending and operating expenses. But with prices lower than most forecasts, analysts and rating agencies are beginning to argue that Shell and other companies may need to go much further.On Monday, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Shells long-term credit one notch  to A+ from AA-  and put five other European oil majors, including BP and the French company Total, on watch for similar potential downgrades.In explaining its downgrade of Shell, S.&P. said it expected the company to generate significantly less cash than it planned to pay out in dividends and capital expenditures through 2017. The agency also said that Shell might be further downgraded after the completion of the BG acquisition.We now believe many major oil and gas companies current and prospective core debt coverage metrics are likely to remain below our rating guidelines for two or three years as the industry adjusts to lower prices, S.&P. said in a statement.The pressure on the companies earnings also raises questions about whether they can continue to pay the generous dividends that are now a crucial attraction for investors  particularly if prices remain in the current range of $30 a barrel, or even lower.BP, in announcing its big loss on Tuesday, said it would continue its 10-cents-a-share dividend but planned to review it each quarter. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, wrote that 2016 is likely to be a year of transition for BP with limited ability to cover its dividend unless oil prices rose substantially.So far, most oil company chiefs have stuck by their commitments to continue paying dividends. But the dividends, which cost the companies billions of dollars each year and were set when oil was selling for more than $100 a barrel, could prove hard to sustain."}

The fund, New Riders L.P., shows just how much some investors are willing to give up to gain a piece of the hottest start-up.Investors are effectively handing over their money with their eyes closed. A person briefed on the terms said that institutional investors were getting financial disclosures on revenue and expense metrics and projects, but the offering document for the New Riders fund that The Times reviewed provides no financial details about Uber.The investors do not get direct equity in Uber either, only indirectly through the fund. This means the fund offers few protections for investors.But this has not prevented wealthy investors from committing about $500 million to Ubers latest round, which values the company at $62.5 billion, according to people briefed on the transaction.Morgan Stanley is not the only one offering such funds. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is pitching a similar fund that requires an investment of at least $1 million and a net worth of $100 million, according to people briefed on the terms.It seems that even as valuations decline and the public stock market stumbles, a sense of euphoria still surrounds this particular unicorn, that is, a private company with a valuation of more than $1 billion.MARTIN SHKRELI INVOKES THE FIFTH AMENDMENT  |  Martin Shkrelis grilling by Congress was just the spectacle that many were anticipating.

{"text": "Female genital cutting has always been seen as an ancient ritual practiced in Africa and to a lesser extent in the Middle East, but a new global assessment documents for the first time that it is widespread in one of the most populous countries in Asia: Indonesia, where almost half the women are estimated to have undergone it.There has long been anecdotal evidence of the practice there, but the United Nations Childrens Fund estimated Thursday that 60 million women and girls there have been cut based on national survey data collected by the Indonesian government. The addition of Indonesia is largely responsible for raising the global tally of women and girls who have undergone the practice to 200 million from 130 million, and the number of countries where it is concentrated to 30 from 29.We knew the practice existed but we didnt have a sense of the scope, said Claudia Cappa, a statistics specialist for Unicef, which released the report. She said the new data from Indonesia showed that cutting was not just an African problem.Experts in Indonesia said the practice there had largely involved a less drastic version of cutting, usually a surface scratch or nick, as compared with more severe disfiguring. The Indonesian governments survey asked parents if their young daughters had undergone circumcision. Ms. Cappa said it was possible that there were some more severe cases in Indonesia, but she said the official Indonesian government definition of female circumcision was an act of scratching the skin that covers the front of clitoris without injuring the clitoris.The Indonesian data is part of Unicefs latest global update on female genital cutting, which shows that over all the practice is declining worldwide. For example, the percentage of girls ages 15 to 19 who have been cut has declined from 51 percent in 1985 to 37 percent today in the countries where the practice is concentrated.Some countries have shown rapid and significant declines. In Egypt, where 97 percent of 15- to 19-year-olds were circumcised 30 years ago, the rate is now 70 percent. Burkina Faso has dropped from 89 percent to 58 percent, and Liberia from 72 percent to 31 percent.Still, even as the United Nations advocates an end to cutting  and Unicef surveys report that men, women, boys and girls in many of the countries agree it should be eliminated  the practice persists. The Unicef report says that current progress is insufficient to keep up with increasing population growth and if trends continue the number of girls and women being cut will rise significantly over the next 15 years.The data from Indonesia, the worlds most populous Muslim-majority nation, provides a snapshot of the prevalence of genital cutting in a country where secular and religious attitudes toward the practice are increasingly in conflict. Indonesian authorities tried to ban cutting 10 years ago, but religious authorities who consider it important for girls to undergo the ritual before marriage objected. In response, the government softened its stance, issuing regulations that directed cutting should be done only by medical professionals in a noninvasive way that does not injure girls and women.The Indonesian survey reported that 49 percent of girls age 11 and younger had undergone female circumcision, mostly as infants, and more than half of the procedures were performed by midwives or other health professionals.The practice is regarded as part of our culture, or a confirmation that they will be officially Islamized,  Jurnalis Uddin, the chairman of the Center for Population and Gender Studies at Yarsi University in Jakarta, said in an email, adding that the practice in Indonesia is mostly symbolic (no cutting at all).For Unicef and others who seek to eliminate the practice in all its forms, the fact that medical providers are performing the procedures is unwelcome because it can confer legitimacy on the practice. We are very concerned with medicalization, said Francesca Moneti, a child protection specialist with Unicef. Medical personnel are looked up to and are seen as knowing whats good for your girl.The Indonesian survey, conducted in 2013 as part of large general health questionnaire administered to 300,000 households, was the first time the government collected national data on the practice. Although the data applied only to girls age 11 and younger, Unicef officials extrapolated it to the entire female population given the practices deep roots there, Ms. Cappa said. Because Indonesia has such a large population, Unicef estimated that about 60 million women and girls in Indonesia have been cut. The survey found that the practice was reported in most provinces, but was more prevalent among urban and wealthier families.Views of the practice among Indonesian women vary. Rena Herdiyani, vice chairwoman of Kalyanamitra, an Indonesian nongovernmental organization that lobbies the national government to ban all forms of cutting, wants the government to impose sanctions on people who perform circumcisions.They think its a family or cultural tradition, and an Islamic obligation, yet they cant name any verses in the Quran about female circumcision, she said.But there are strong supporters like Lia Sarifah, 47, whose experience involved more than just a scratch and occurred when she was 7 because her parents wanted her to be old enough to remember it. She recalls shaking with fear as she lay down on a bed at her parents house on the island of Sulawesi, and said a traditional healer pushed up the hem of her new dress, holding a small traditional knife in his gloved hands. A few minutes later he stood up with a small sliver of her clitoris.But Ms. Lia said she recalled that day not with anger or shame, but with pride.Even today, I believe in circumcision and support it, she said, sitting on the floor of her Jakarta salon, where she also makes and sells ceremonial dresses for young girls circumcisions. If we dont, then we cant be whole as women and we cant marry.Conflicting views have influenced public policy toward cutting. In 2006, the Ministry of Health issued a document banning female circumcision by medical professionals. In response, in 2008, Indonesias top Muslim clerical body issued a nonbinding fatwa or edict saying female circumcision should be performed if requested, as long as the method was not physically or psychologically dangerous.In 2010, the Ministry of Health, at the urging of the clerical body, issued a regulation saying female circumcision should be performed only by licensed doctors, midwives or nurses using safety and cleanliness procedures detailed by the ministry. But anti-cutting activists objected to the regulation, and in 2014 it was repealed. Unicef officials assert in their report that the repeal does not go far enough because it does not explicitly prohibit cutting or set penalties for those who perform the procedure.In Jakarta, Fitri Yanti, a pregnant 30-year-old mother of two, said she did not understand what all the fuss was about. She said she was not mutilated during her circumcision, didnt bleed at all and felt nearly no pain during or after the procedure. Mutilation is horrible, but its not true that it happens here in Indonesia, Ms. Fitri said. They cannot stop us. Its our tradition."}
{"text": "Few plays are more exciting in football than the interception return for a touchdown, the pick-six. For one team, 6 points come out of nowhere; for the other, hope turns to despair.And should the Carolina Panthers standout linebacker Luke Kuechly be in the right place at the right time on Sunday, he could do something no one has done: complete a pick-six in every playoff game all the way through the Super Bowl.An all-American and the ninth overall draft pick out of Boston College in 2012, Kuechly is a three-time N.F.L. first team All-Pro and regularly rated as the best linebacker in the game. Pro Football Focus ranked him tied for the best defensive player in the league this season and reported that he missed only six tackles on the year.What more could you ask for than a guy to come in and take the league by storm? Panthers tight end Greg Olsen said. Hes a special player. Hes been as good as there is on the defensive side of the ball since hes come in the league.Evan Mathis, a Denver Broncos guard, said: I think it starts with Kuechly. He is pretty much the quarterback of their defense. He gets them in the right positions.Kuechly tied his career high with four interceptions in the regular season and had his first for a touchdown, off Tony Romo.Then, in the divisional round of the playoffs, with the Panthers leading the Seahawks by 7-0, Russell Wilson came under pressure and tossed it right to Kuechly, who ran it in from 14 yards. In the conference championship the next week, against Arizona, with the score 42-15, and the game won, Kuechly jumped in front of receiver John Brown and ran back a 22-yarder.Kuechlys two playoff pick-sixes put him in elite company; only two players have more. Asante Samuel of the Patriots and the Eagles is the career leader with four, and Willie Brown of the 1970s Raiders had three, including one in Super Bowl XI off Fran Tarkenton for 75 yards. But neither managed a pick-six in every playoff game in a season. (Rod Woodson is the regular-season career leader with 12, but he never had one in the playoffs.)There have been 14 interception returns for touchdowns in the Super Bowl, by a total of 13 players. (Dwight Smith had two in Tampa Bays romp over Oakland in January 2003.) Despite the inherent drama of pick-sixes, many of them were essentially inconsequential to the game result. All but one occurred with the intercepting team in the lead: not too surprising, as trailing teams start to pass more and eventually start taking extreme passing risks. Every team with a Super Bowl pick-six went on to win the game.The only Super Bowl pick-six that gave a team a lead was an early one by Ty Law in 2002 to put the Patriots ahead, 7-3, over the Rams. But the most important was probably by Tracy Porter in February 2010. The Saints were up by 7 with three and a half minutes left, but Peyton Manning had brought the Colts to the New Orleans 31 and was looking to tie the score. Porter got in front of Reggie Wayne and took the interception back 74 yards, sealing the Saints only Super Bowl victory.While the chance of an individual player, even one as good as Kuechly, making a pick-six in a game is quite small, having Manning on the other side of the ball for this Super Bowl might make a difference. Mannings interception rate this year was 5.1 percent, the highest of his career, and comfortably the highest in the league for quarterbacks who started at least half their teams games.Obviously, the season didnt go as well as he wanted it to, but he is Peyton Manning, Kuechly said. Hes still smart and can still make the throws, and it is evident. Ive watched him throw the ball from one hash to the opposite hash on an out route. Ive seen him throw the deep ball, and hes still Peyton Manning in every way that I see it.Kuechly is saying the right things. But if a wayward Manning pass comes his way with the end zone in sight, few would bet against another touchdown."}
{"text": "Can collaboration be seen as a feminist platform? The dance duo robbinschilds  formed in 2003 by Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs  is giving that idea a shot by branching out, choreographically speaking, to include six dancers in the creation of Hex, the pairs latest work. Its a female collective, but is it feminist? In the end, the fight against artistic hierarchy is more noble than effective. Topping the lengthy list of what Hex is missing is a point of view.Conceived and directed by Ms. Robbins and Ms. Childs, Hex, performed at Gibney Dance: Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center, is not about casting a harmful spell, but rather uses the word to hint at the witchy notion of shape-shifting, in which dance movements are transferred from one body to the next. While Vanessa Anspaugh was part of the creative process, she does not appear in the final work, making what might have been a hexagon into more of a pentagon. The dancers in the flesh are Aretha Aoki, Anna Azrieli, Eleanor Smith, Bessie McDonough-Thayer and Mariana Valencia.In preparation, each artist created a short solo, which was then developed by members of the cast before becoming part of the works rambling framework. Still, there is a system at work, which is indicated by six videos projected along the back of the stage featuring the dancers executing movement phrases that repeat and trickle throughout the piece. Ms. Azrieli, cupping her hands behind her head, executes a headstand, with her legs separated in a V. Ms. Smith squats while brushing the backs of her hands on the floor. Ms. Valencia takes methodical steps and claps her hands.Clipped footwork, demi-point turns, lashing arms, chopping feet and random guttural utterances by Ms. Azrieli  and for me, a moan is usually one too many in a dance  build to little in this listless piece. Perhaps there is a curse in Hex, which manages to sap the individuality from five capable and usually evocative dancers; the intermittent buzz of street traffic and the resort-vibe costuming, credited to the designer Rachel Comey, is no help in lifting this work out of its conventional, derivative binding. Theres nothing wrong with a collective voice. The requirement you cant skip out on is imagination."}
{"text": "Two fireballs streaked across the sky in the past week, creating dazzling, ephemeral displays for hundreds of people below. Dashboard cameras, rooftop cameras and even one mounted on a small airplane captured footage of the bright objects in the night skies.The first meteor appeared on Jan. 30, at 6:16 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, and was seen by more than 900 people across Virginia, New York and New Jersey, according to the American Meteor Society.Mike Grossman spotted it from 1,500 feet in the air while piloting his private plane over the Hudson River in New York. He captured video using a camera he had previously mounted to the tail of his aircraft to record that nights scenic flight.Theres no way you could miss it, he said. With your peripheral vision, youre immediately struck by it. He watched as the meteor blazed across the sky for about three seconds, then radioed in to the La Guardia Airport radio tower to report what he saw. Upon reviewing his footage, Mr. Grossman said he was pleasantly surprised that he had captured the fireball but said that the video does not compare with the spectacle he saw from the cockpit.Its totally unexpected, one of those moments when you dont know how to process what youre seeing.Alexander Salvador caught this dashcam video of the same bright white object from Falls Church, Va., while out food shopping for his family.It came out of nowhere, he said. The first thing I said was Ooh a comet! Then it quickly dawned on me that it couldnt have been a comet, it was too close.Mr. Salvador said the sight was unnerving at first, but that he was happy to have caught it with his camera. You cant take credit for anything thats luck. And thats what this was, being at the right place at the right time.A rooftop weather camera on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison captured footage of the second fireball, which flew over Lake Michigan on Feb. 1 at 7:27 p.m. E.S.T. It was also reported by more than a hundred people in Wisconsin and Michigan.Were seeing something thats coming into the atmosphere at very high speed, fast enough that the friction with the Earths atmosphere causes it to begin to vaporize, said Jim Lattis, an astronomer at the university.Hundreds of fireballs streak across Earths atmosphere every day, Dr. Lattis said, but people witness few of them. The majority fly over uninhabited areas, and many also occur during daytime when the suns glare makes them hard to detect.For someone who doesnt spend much time looking at the sky, seeing something like this could be a once in a lifetime experience, he said.In total, the A.M.S. website received more than a thousand reports about the two events. Using that data, the organization can estimate the velocity and trajectory of the fireballs, according to Mike Hankey, the operations manager for the A.M.S.Fireball, he said, is an astronomical term that defines a meteor brighter than the planet Venus. Luminosity is measured on a scale, where Venus has a magnitude of about -3 brightness and the sun measures about -24, he said.A -3 is like Whoa, thats a bright shooting star. You might see it in New York City, he said. A -24 is so bright you might be like Oh my God, the world is ending. It would stop traffic. He said that these two were about a -14, or about the brightness of the full moon.What people saw during these events were either chunks of ice from comets that rain through Earths atmosphere, or rocky pieces of asteroids. Mr. Hankey also said that their website receives more reports in February than any other month, though scientists arent exactly clear why.Its a good month to look at the sky, he said. Your chances of seeing a fireball definitely go up."}

The glass door has an authentic barber-pole swirl.As a woman, I am used to fussy appointments at hair salons, having to decide between a junior or senior stylist. But there are no appointments at Lanas Barber Shop, and when I enter, I sit in a kind of line, a head count of who came first, who will come back later, who is in no rush, so go ahead, its fine.Its my son Im here for, and he pulls out a box of toy trucks from under a chair as if hes been coming forever, knows the whispered history of the place. He sprawls himself out on the floor.There are men waiting, eating muffins from paper bags. Lana moves around a customer in the chair, a circular dance choreographed to the tinkling bell at the door.One man enters and hands Lana a coffee, then leaves without a word. Another enters with school artwork from his son. A gift to hang in the window but reclaimed minutes later when the boy realizes what he has given up.Again, the door swings open. A man and his dog.

{"text": "From Juliet to Alice Kramden, women have communed from their upper-story windows, but few ever reached a wider audience with as mundane a message as Mary Fiumara.In an indelible long-running television commercial first broadcast in 1969, Mrs. Fiumara, playing a devoted, robust and aproned mother, convincingly hollers Anthony! Anthony! from a second-floor tenement window in the Italian North End of Boston to summon home her 12-year-old son from blocks away for a hearty serving of Prince spaghetti.To get there, Anthony, in short pants and sneakers, wends his way through a crowded street market, races up the stairs and arrives out of breath but, like his welcoming mother, smiling.Mrs. Fiumara (pronounced few-MAH-ruh) died on Tuesday. She was 88 and had lived in the North End since she was a teenager. Her death was confirmed by her son, John Fiumara.Her long connection to the neighborhood was a big reason she was cast for the commercial. Its producers had been seeking authenticity, choosing to film in the North End itself and casting local people whom they discovered on location.Mrs. Fiumara was chosen when a casting director saw her peering from a window. (The apartment in the ad was not hers, however.)Her two-word speaking part was the beginning and end of Mrs. Fiumaras acting career. She went back to being a homemaker and remained one.The boy in the commercial, Anthony Martignetti, and his family had moved to the neighborhood from Italy only a few years before he was cast. Shown for 13 years, the commercial transformed him into a local celebrity. He is now 58.If it wasnt for her, the commercial would never exist, Mr. Martignetti, a court officer and the divorced father of a 12-year-old son of his own, said of Mrs. Fiumara in a phone interview on Thursday.She was like my second mother, he said. She was always looking out for me, and anytime I would see her on the streets, she said, How you doing, Anthony, can I buy you an ice cream?  even before the commercial.Mr. Martignetti said he ultimately made about $20,000 from the Prince commercial. He appeared in one other, for a local restaurant. His son auditioned for a remake of the Prince commercial on the companys centennial, but someone else got the part.Prince Spaghetti, now a division of the New World Pasta Company in Harrisburg, Pa., was founded on Prince Street in Boston by three Sicilian immigrants in 1912.In the early 1950s, to broaden its appeal beyond Italian-American consumers (and to entice those who still made their own macaroni), the company proclaimed, Wednesday is Prince spaghetti day.The Jerome OLeary advertising agency in Boston had coined a generic version of the slogan for a macaroni industry association, but when the group rejected it, it was snapped up by Princes chief executive, Joseph Pellegrino, another agency client. Mr. Pellegrino, a former shoeshine boy from Brooklyn, simply added the companys name.Mrs. Fiumara, born Oct. 6, 1927, in Italy, the daughter of Angelo Fronduto and the former Teresa Coppola, is survived by her sons, John and Richard; three grandchildren; and a brother, Pasquale Fronduto."}

{"text": "KENT, Conn.  This town is considering a program that trains teachers to use firearms if a gunman attacks, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has come out forcefully against the idea.Kent selectmen voted 2 to 1 on Wednesday to present information about the Faculty/Administrator Safety Training and Emergency Response program to the Board of Education. The board will decide whether to start the program at the Kent Center School, which houses prekindergarten through eighth grade.The nonprofit program would provide trauma kits and firearms training to school personnel to use in the event of a hostile act or intrusion.In an interview on Thursday with The Associated Press, Mr. Malloy said that he was particularly concerned that the program would also allow anonymous volunteers to carry weapons at school. It offers 26 hours of training over three days in Ohio.If any board of education would approve this, Id be shocked, frightened and disappointed, said Mr. Malloy, a Democrat. It makes no sense. And no school system in the state of Connecticut should be allowed to do this.Selectman Jeffrey Parkin first presented the program to town officials in January.Its being suggested that teachers would be walking around the school visibly packing guns, he told The Danbury News Times. If Kent went into this program, the gun or guns would be concealed. It would be up to the Board of Education how the gun would be kept, possibly in a safe with access for trained staff.Mr. Malloy said that if school districts wanted properly trained security, such as former police officers, it was their decision to make."}

{"text": "On Thursday we challenged Well readers to unravel the case of a 67-year-old healthy retiree who suddenly developed knife-like chest pain and a worsening cough. Maybe this case was too easy because more than a quarter of you figured it out.The correct diagnosis is:Eosinophilic pneumonia, caused by the antibiotic daptomycin (brand name Cubicin)The first reader to make this not-quite-as-tough-as-I-thought diagnosis was Francis Graziano, a second-year medical student at Georgetown University School of Medicine. He had just learned about daptomycin and recalled that there were some pretty dramatic side effects linked to it. And the time course seemed right. So he went to the Wikipedia page on the drug and saw that this type of pneumonia was a known adverse reaction to it. Francis is another two-time winner, having solved another tough case two years ago. Well done, Francis.The DiagnosisDaptomycin is an antibiotic used primarily to treat drug-resistant staph infections. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003.The first report suggesting a link between this antibiotic and pneumonia was made in 2007. An 87-year-old man who, like this patient, was being treated with daptomycin for an infection after knee surgery lost 15 pounds over the course of just a few weeks and became increasingly fatigued. A CT scan of his chest revealed multiple nodules, and when these nodules were biopsied, the patient was found to have a pneumonia.But it was an unusual pneumonia. Instead of finding bacteria or the usual infection-fighting white blood cells in the lungs, the sample showed a handful of eosinophils (or eos), a type of white blood cell that normally fights off parasites (like intestinal worms) but can also be seen in allergic reactions. The doctors suspected that the pneumonia was an allergic reaction to the daptomycin. They stopped the drug, and the pneumonia resolved.As a result of this case report, the F.D.A. put eosinophilic pneumonia on the list of possible adverse reactions. By 2011, 11 cases had been reported, enough to convince the F.D.A. that the link was real.Eosinophilic pneumonia is an unusual disorder and is usually caused by exposure to certain drugs or toxins or radiation therapy. The most common trigger is cigarette smoke, and the illness may occur in those who recently started or restarted smoking. More than 300 different medications have been linked to eosinophilic pneumonia; antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen are most commonly cited.How or why this pneumonia develops is not clear. Men are more likely to be affected than women. In the cases of eosinophilic pneumonia associated with daptomycin, patients were all over age 60.How the Diagnosis Was MadeDr. Robert Centor was the doctor on call when the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient was seen by the resident on his team, who called to tell him about the 67-year-old man with the infected knee and a week-long pneumonia.Dr. Centor was intrigued. Why would a pretty healthy guy on antibiotics for one infection develop a second infection? He was getting his antibiotics through an intravenous catheter than ran from a vein in his arm into his heart. Could some type of skin bug have traveled up the catheter into his heart, and from there into his lungs?He asked the resident to make sure that the patient had a CT scan of his chest to look for tiny pieces of infection, known as septic emboli, which might be clogging up the blood vessels in his lungs. The patient got the  scan, which showed only the fluffy clouds dotted throughout his lungs.The next morning, Dr. Centor went to the radiology suite to review the chest X-ray and CT scan with the radiologist. No septic emboli were present. After confirming what hed already heard the night before, the internist headed up to see the patient with his team.Looking for AnswersAfter talking to the patient and examining him, Dr. Centor was certain of two things. First, that the patient was seriously ill. Second, that he wasnt sure why. It didnt make any sense at all that this youthful 67-year-old retiree should suddenly develop a whopping double pneumonia.Certainly bad things can happen to healthy people, but Dr. Centor liked to understand why. In this case, I was completely befuddled, Dr. Centor told me in his thoughtful Southern twang. We were old friends; he had been a wonderful teacher and mentor to me. But whenever I am befuddled, I just talk to other people, he told me.I know from my own experience that often enough, just posing a case to a colleague as a question can prompt you to see it in a different light and reveal an answer you hadnt considered. And if youre really lucky, the answer comes from asking someone who has previously come across a similar case. So Dr. Centor, who was the dean of his residency program, headed to the cafeteria, where he grabbed a cup of coffee and scanned the room for familiar faces. He settled down at a table full of doctors and residents and quickly outlined the case.The Right Place, the Right TimeMohamed Raja, a resident in his second year of training, listened carefully to the case. It was a matter of being in the right place at the right time, he told me.  Because as soon as Dr. Centor mentioned the name of the antibiotic the patient had been getting, the resident realized with a jolt that he knew the diagnosis.Well, he said to Dr. Centor, he had been reading up on Cubicin just the week before. And there was this rare complication associated with the drug that had caught his attention. It was an allergic reaction that manifests itself as a terrible and painful pneumonia, caused not by an infection but by the patients own white blood cells, the eosinophils.Hearing of this unusual reaction, Dr. Centor quickly pulled out his cellphone and looked up Cubicin and eosinophilic pneumonia. Sure enough, this unusual side effect, first described just a few years earlier, seemed to fit his patient exactly.The only way to know for certain was to get a lung doctor to put a scope into the patients lungs and see if these specialized cells, the eosinophils, were there. They shouldnt be. But first he had to stop the medication.Dr. Centor called the nurses to make certain the patient didnt get his next scheduled dose. Then he went upstairs to tell his team and the patient.Waiting for WatsonIt is the nature of medical knowledge that no one knows everything. We doctors all learn the same basics, and what we add depends on the patients we see and the interests we pursue. One of the key skills all doctors must hone is how to recognize and supplement these almost inevitable gaps.The Internet has made this kind of supplementation much, much easier. For example, when Dr. Centor first told me about this case, he gave me the outline and asked what I thought was going on  a game we often play. I didnt know, but what I call test logic told me that if he was telling me the name of the antibiotic, it had to be part of the answer. So I Googled the terms daptomycin and pneumonia and whammo, I got the answer immediately.Last fall, IBM announced that it is developing a health care business based on its supercomputer, Watson. Using the same data-accumulating skills that allowed Watson to conquer Jeopardy! in 2011, the goal is to master all medical knowledge  new and old  so that we wont have to. But until then, doctors must continue to rely on their own data accumulating skills.Dr. Centor turned first to the traditional method, the who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire option of phoning a friend, before turning to other sources. Will Watson  or any of the other emerging databases  fully replace human recall and thought? They havent so far.How the Patient FaredThe patient had the bronchoscopy the next day. He had eosinophils and no signs of infection. He was started on high-dose steroids to calm the allergic reaction, and the Cubicin was replaced with another antibiotic for the last weeks of treatment.Its been four months since his scary pneumonia episode, and the patient tells me he feels just fine. Hes resigned to the fact that his knee may never be perfect. But breathing? No problem.As for his fishing camp, its closed for the winter. But hell be back as soon as the weather, and his knee, allow."}
{"text": "When the current Robert Frank exhibit at New York University closes next week, its really closing: The images will be handed over to photo students who will, in a private ceremony, draw on them or sculpt them into some creation of their choosing. Then they will destroy them.And Mr. Frank is O.K. with that.The show, Robert Frank: Books and Films, 1947-2016, was produced on rolls of newsprint nailed to the wall and is all about the artistic value of Mr. Franks images, not their worth as physical objects (which can fetch as much as $600,000 each).We dont have to be respectful for the typical form of the photo, said Gerhard Steidl, the publisher who curated the show. We have to be respectful for the art and for the lifetimes work of Robert Frank, but not of the physical form.The closing ritual, which reinforces the importance of the image over the object, will be repeated at the end of more than 50 similar exhibits of Mr. Franks work being held worldwide. In keeping with that spirit, the exhibit catalog, a 64-page broadsheet newspaper, costs only $5. Over two million copies will be printed in English, German and Japanese  so it may take a while before it becomes an expensive collectors item.Mr. Frank and Mr. Steidl, longtime collaborators, wanted to share the work with the largest possible audience, but the cost of insuring and transporting extremely valuable prints, and the difficulty of getting them from collectors and museums, made a regular traveling exhibit impossible.A more democratic experience, without costly museum entry fees and an expensive catalog, was made possible by using rolls of newsprint with a state-of-the-art digital printer at the Steidl publishing house in Germany. The exhibit was then rolled up into two tubes, which Mr. Steidl and his assistant carried with them aboard a Lufthansa flight to New York.The exhibit includes images spanning Mr. Franks career, as well as copies of his books, many printed by Steidl. Visitors can also study enlarged reproductions of Mr. Franks contact sheets. His films  which were screened at the university last weekend  are represented through individual frames.The newspaper-style catalog was conceived by Mr. Steidl, edited by Alex Rhle and designed by Stefan Dimitrov and Christian Tnsmann of the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung.Relying on a broadsheet led to a catalog quite different from the typical photo book. Instead of a simple introduction, critical essay and images, readers experience a wide selection of interviews, documents and stories about Mr. Frank and his work, combined with an elegant display of 242 photos. Perusing the catalog is akin to sitting down to a sumptuous seven-course dinner accompanied by fine wines and at least two desserts.For less than the cost of a fast-food meal.Among the more unexpected inclusions is a police report from Mr. Franks arrest in 1955 in Arkansas for being a suspicious driver with New York license plates. The Swiss-born artist was jailed for speaking with a foreign accent, having a number of cameras and possessing more than one passport in different languages.That experience didnt keep him off the road. An essay by Jack Kerouac recounts a road trip from New York to Florida with Mr. Frank in April 1958.I sit in the car amazed to see the photographic artist prowling like a cat, or an angry bear in the grass and roads, shooting whatever he wants to see, he wrote. How I wished I had a camera of my own, a mad mental camera that could register pictorial shots of the photographic artist himself prowling about.At last weeks opening at N.Y.U.s Tisch School of the Arts, hundreds of people waited hours to get inside the small room where Mr. Steidl and Mr. Frank were having a brief conversation. Those fortunate enough to get in listened intently as Mr. Frank, 91, spoke of his gratitude for coming to America and his appreciation of his publishers devotion.Afterward, one person asked a question that is most asked at such affairs: Did Mr. Frank have any advice for photography students?He did, and it was short and graceful: Keep your eyes open.Robert Frank: Books and Films, 1947-2016 is on view at New York Universitys Tisch School of the Arts until Feb. 11.Follow @JamesEstrin and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

On television, Guy Fieri and his son go on a European vacation, Vice returns to HBO and Animals makes its debut.LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) on Amazon. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are drawn together by loneliness in this moody, funny film from Sofia Coppola. An American actor, Bob, who has sheepishly gone to Tokyo to shill for Suntory whiskey, meets a woman, Charlotte, who has been left alone by her husband, a photographer. At karaoke, she sings the Pretenders Brass in Pocket, and he sings Roxy Musics More Than This. Its a pleasure to watch. A joy of filmmaking pervades the movie, and an instinctive understanding of the medium is evident, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. Sound is used so beautifully it takes your breath away; in a scene where Bob carries the dozing Charlotte to her room, the hotel corridor is gently dusted with aural density; the noise of air-conditioners and fluorescent lights becomes a part of the milieu.

{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea   North Korea likes to call South Korea a land of political filth and its leaders, including President Park Geun-hye, human trash. Now, apparently to highlight its contempt, it has begun sending balloons into the South with an unusual payload, the police here said on Thursday: cigarette butts.North and South Korea have escalated their propaganda war across their heavily armed border since Jan. 6, when the North conducted its fourth nuclear test.The South turned on high-powered loudspeakers to blare pop songs and harsh criticism of the Norths leader, Kim Jong-un, across the border. The North began sending balloons into the South loaded with leaflets.The balloons were timed to detonate their payloads, scattering thousands of messages that, among other things, called Ms. Park a filthy president.Some of the timers failed to function, however, and the airborne cargo crashed onto rooftops and cars in South Korean villages near the border. Inspecting the debris, military and police personnel discovered that the balloons payloads included things they had not seen before.We can confirm that they included cigarette butts, Kim Hak-young, a chief superintendent of the police, said Thursday, though he declined to provide any details.The police and the Defense Ministry until Thursday had refused to confirm a news report earlier in the week that some North Korean balloons were carrying trash, including used toilet paper.The Korea JoongAng Daily newspaper reported on Tuesday that the discovery had alarmed South Korean officials and led to fears that the North might have sent hazardous biochemical agents. But an investigation showed the trash was just trash.Loudspeakers and propaganda balloons were favorite weapons of psychological warfare used by the two Koreas during the Cold War.Both sides decommissioned them after a landmark summit meeting in 2000 at which they agreed to promote reconciliation.But anti-North Korean activists in the South began sending propaganda balloons into the North in recent years as inter-Korean relations soured, especially over the Norths nuclear weapons program. The balloons carried dollar bills, transistor radios, CDs containing Western movies and leaflets that called Mr. Kim a pig.North Korea had repeatedly threatened to retaliate."}
{"text": "On a recent Sunday morning, the actor Eugene Levy crouched next to an industrial fan at a sound stage in Queens. A nearby smoke machine cloaked Mr. Levy and everyone else on the set in a gray haze.How many shots do they need to blow some air up a dress? Mr. Levy asked, peering at the actress standing on a platform above him.The line was among those Mr. Levy was trying out as part of the script, but it was also the question many on the production team were most likely asking themselves, as the director ordered take after take to make sure every detail was just right.Mr. Levy was not on a movie set, however. He was filming a Super Bowl commercial for Snickers.The work being put into the ad  which riffs on the classic scene in The Seven Year Itch when a gust of air from a subway grate blows Marilyn Monroes dress up  underscores the lengths to which brands are now going to make the most of the staggering $5 million it costs to buy 30 seconds of commercial time during the Super Bowl, which will be shown on CBS on Sunday.The average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad has increased roughly 50 percent in the last decade when adjusted for inflation, according to data provided by WPPs Kantar Media. And this year is more expensive than ever, putting blockbuster-level pressure on brands to produce ads that justify the hefty price tag.Advertisers are reticent about how much they spend to produce Super Bowl ads, but an average commercial during the game costs more than $160,000 a second for the commercial time alone. In a loose comparison, Star Wars: The Force Awakens cost roughly $25,000 a second to produce.Its a mind-warping amount of money, said Andrew Florance, the chief executive of the CoStar Group, which owns Apartments.com, another Super Bowl advertiser.Advertisers have sought for years to milk more attention from their Super Bowl spots, releasing online teasers and creating contests on social media, among assorted bells and whistles. But with the media landscape undergoing constant change and becoming ever more varied, there is also an underlying anxiety about how best to reach people.Even as advertising dollars shift online, television commercials  particularly during live events like the Super Bowl that draw huge audiences are still in many ways the surest way to get in front of the most eyeballs at once. The Super Bowl also appeals to advertisers because many viewers are just as eager to watch the commercials as they are to watch the game.The high price and high pressure can be worth it. Lesser-known brands like Avocados From Mexico, a first-time advertiser last year, boast of increased awareness among consumers and significant bumps in sales.But it also comes with a big risk: If the ads flop  or worse, create backlash  they can be an embarrassment and a big waste of money. A commercial for Nationwide insurance during last years Super Bowl that showed a young boy lamenting the things he would never be able to do  Ill never learn to ride a bike. I wont get cooties.  because he had died from a preventable accident was quickly derided for being too morose. The executive who oversaw the spot has since left the company.The high cost of Super Bowl ads also comes at a time when many brands are looking to cut their overall advertising budgets. So the decision to hand over millions of dollars for a single commercial is not one advertisers take lightly.Obviously, everyone takes a look at the cost of the Super Bowl investment, said Matt Montei, senior marketing director for Wrigley confections, which includes Skittles.To justify that spending, many brands are now looking for more ways to hold consumers attention once the commercials go off the air. Nearly every brand has a social media strategy. Google and Facebook both introduced new Super Bowl-related offerings in recent weeks to help advertisers further infiltrate viewers second screens.We have a whole war room set up at the agency, said Dean Evans, the chief marketing officer for Hyundai Motor America, which will run two 30-second spots during the game and two 60-second spots before the game.Some brands have decided that the frenzy is not worth it. GoDaddy, whose provocative ads have run during the Super Bowl since 2005, decided not to make a TV appearance this year. Instead, the company is placing targeted online ads and running a 30-second spot during the live stream of the game on CBSSports.com. It is also advertising on Facebook Sports Stadium, a new offer from the web giant in which users can follow information, comments and posts about events in real time.We dont need to use TV and the Super Bowl to get our name out there, said Phil Bienert, the chief marketing officer of GoDaddy. He said that advertising during the Super Bowl was like playing Powerball because there are so many ads that it is difficult to stand out. Last year, 39 companies, some with multiple brands, ran ads during the Super Bowl.Snickers, however, is willing to play the lottery. At the Queens soundstage, the actor Willem Dafoe  playing the part of a cranky, hungry Marilyn Monroe  wore a white dress and heels, which gave him some difficulty as he stood on the subway grate reading his lines. At one point, he yelled that someone in his line of sight was distracting him, sending the production team scrambling to remove the offender so that shooting, which was scheduled to take all day, could resume.Theres a lot of pressure, said Peter Kain, executive creative director at BBDO New York, the ad agency working with Snickers. They spend so much money on it, and they want their moneys worth."}
{"text": "For his bookshop and website One Grand Books, the editor Aaron Hicklin asked people to name the 10 books theyd take with them if they were marooned on a desert island. The next in the series is the cartoonist Alison Bechdel, winner of the 2014 MacArthur Genius Award and creator of the Bechdel test, which measures gender bias in film. She is also the author of the autobiographical graphic novel Fun Home, which was adapted into the Tony-winning musical of the same name. She shares her list exclusively with T.Mansfield Park, Jane AustenId definitely need some Jane Austen on a desert island, so I choose her most complex book. Lots of people (including Austens mother) find the heroine Fanny insipid, but as a shy person I identify with her and love how she learns to speak up for herself.The Price of Salt, Patricia HighsmithThis has been on my list forever, but its been getting a lot of attention lately because of Todd Hayness excellent movie adaptation, Carol. It was the first novel about lesbians to have a happy ending, but its also a really unnerving and propulsive story, like all of Patricia Highsmiths books. She originally published it under a pseudonym so it didnt wreck her career.The Night Watch, Sarah WatersI love all of Sarah Waterss historical fiction, but this is my favorite novel, set during and after World War II. It starts slow but picks up insane momentum, using reverse narration to follow the characters backward in time to the explosive wartime scenes that shaped them.Martin Bauman: Or, A Sure Thing, David LeavittI love this book almost as much as I hate it. Martin, a thinly disguised version of Leavitt himself, describes the brat pack of young writers he was a part of in the New York literary scene of the mid-1980s. Its sort of like watching a train wreck, fascinating and horrifying at once.Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, Audre LordeI read this in my early 20s when I was voraciously devouring autobiographical books about lesbians and gay men. Lordes examination of her multiple outsiderness  black, female, queer, West Indian, poet  pried my sheltered mind wide open.Amphigorey, Edward GoreyThis is actually 15 of Edward Goreys illustrated masterpieces in one. My favorite is The Unstrung Harp, about a novelist writing his biennial book  the funniest and most accurate description of the creative process Ive ever seen.The Dharma Bums, Jack KerouacThis is a great book about Kerouac and his disguised but easily decrypted Beat pals hiking in the Sierras and discussing Buddhism back in the days when nobody did that.To The Lighthouse, Virginia WoolfI reread this book every once in a while, and every time I do I find it more capacious and startling. Its so revolutionary and so exquisitely wrought that it keeps evolving on its own somehow, as if its alive.Possession, A.S. ByattI am a sucker for campus novels, and this is one of the best, even though it has some pretty scathing things to say about feminist literary criticism.Harriet the Spy, Louise FitzhughI found this really unnerving when I first read it at age 8. Theres a lot of talk lately about kids books for adults. But this is an adult book for kids  a realistic, complex and not-at-all-dumbed-down look at a girl who wants more than anything else to be a writer. When I grew up and learned that Fitzhugh was a lesbian, that explained a bit more about why Harriet resonated so much for me."}
{"text": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia   Syrian government forces supported by heavy Russian airstrikes advanced in the countrys north on Thursday, nearly surrounding rebels in the city of Aleppo and displacing thousands of civilians.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia said it was willing to participate in a ground operation against the jihadists of the Islamic State if the United States and other nations fighting the group agreed to initiate such a campaign.The latest developments in the five-year-old conflict came a day after the United Nations suspended a new round of international peace talks that had made no progress toward ending the war.The Syria conflict has escalated from a civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad and rebels seeking his ouster to an international proxy war.While the United States, Saudi Arabia and other nations support the rebels, Iran has sent military personnel to help the government, and Russia is bombing opposition forces. And all oppose the Islamic State, which has seized territory spanning the Syrian-Iraqi border.If the government were to gain control of Aleppo, Syrias largest commercial center before the war, the loss would represent a major blow for the rebels after being pushed out of other major towns and cities by both the government and the Islamic State. The governments recent advance makes it clear that Russias intervention has not simply stabilized the governments position, but enabled it to advance, diminishing pressure on Mr. Assad to compromise in negotiations.The new government advances between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border were facilitated by heavy Russian and Syrian airstrikes that increased while representatives of the warring parties were in Geneva for peace talks, opposition activists said. Aleppo has been divided between government- and rebel-controlled zones since 2012.While government forces coming from the east and west had yet to meet and successfully block rebel supply lines on Thursday, fighting and airstrikes in the area had cut off the main route used to deliver humanitarian aid, according to Mercy Corps, an aid group.We are cut off from Aleppo city, David Evans, the groups regional program director for the Middle East, said in a statement. It feels like a siege of Aleppo is about to begin.The fighting sent civilians streaming out of the area toward the Turkish border.Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey told an international donors conference in London on Thursday that 10,000 Syrians were waiting on the Syrian side of the Turkish border while 70,000 more were heading that way.Activists inside Syria posted videos of huge crowds of civilians fleeing, many with children and carrying belongings in grain sacks.While Russia has long supported Mr. Assad, it joined the war as a combatant last year, launching airstrikes it said targeted the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, although it mostly bombed opposition forces unconnected to the Islamic State.The air support has blunted rebel offensives and allowed the government to retake some areas.Saudi officials have long been frustrated with the reluctance of the United States to increase its military support for the opposition, a patchwork of armed groups that include extremists linked to Al Qaeda.While the kingdom supports the idea of a political settlement, it says military pressure may be needed to bring it about.We believe that changing the balance of power on the ground is going to open up the way to a political settlement, Adel Al Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, said in an interview on Thursday.Mr. Jubeir did not mention the possibility of ground troops. But in a surprise statement broadcast on the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news network, a spokesman for the Saudi Defense Ministry suggested that the kingdom could send soldiers to fight the Islamic State.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is prepared to participate in any ground operations that the anti-ISIS coalition might agree to carry out in Syria if there is consensus among coalition leaders, the spokesman, Ahmed Asiri, said.It appeared to be the first time Saudi Arabia had publicly suggested such a possibility, and had done so without first discussing the matter with the other nations fighting the Islamic State.Asked about the Saudi comments, John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said he had not seen the Saudi proposal and would not comment on it, Reuters reported.The sending of ground troops to Syria would be a significant escalation in the kingdoms involvement in the war. American officials say the kingdom and other Persian Gulf nations have largely stopped participating in the bombing campaign because of their focus on the war in Yemen."}
{"text": "LONDON  When Noel Santillan typed the word Laugarvegur instead of Laugavegur into his rental cars GPS, the New Jersey resident couldnt have imagined that the extra r would make him something of a celebrity in Iceland.Mr. Santillan, 28, arrived at Keflavik International Airport on Monday morning after a five-hour flight from New York and was eager to get to the Hotel Fron on Laugavegur, a main street in Reykjavik, Icelands capital, local news media reported. But the spelling error got in his way, according to Visir, an Icelandic news website.While driving nearly six hours over icy roads, Mr. Santillan, who works in retail marketing, had an inkling that something might be wrong, local news reports said.His suspicion was confirmed when he arrived in Siglufjordur, a remote fishing village in northern Iceland that is roughly 430 kilometers, or about 270 miles, from the airport and has a road named Laugarvegur.There, a local woman informed him that he was not in Reykjavik, which is about 45 minutes by bus from the airport at which Mr. Santillan arrived.I was very tired after the flight and wanted to get to the hotel as soon as possible, Mr. Santillan was quoted by Visir as saying. Thats why I kept driving. I did enjoy the scenery on the way. Ive never seen anything quite like it. And the horses!Mr. Santillan told the state broadcaster that he saw signs showing Reykjavik was in the other direction, but that he had put his faith in the GPS.Efforts to reach Mr. Santillan were unsuccessful, and his account could not be independently verified.Mr. Santillans unintended journey has captured the imagination of Iceland, and the people of Siglufjordur have embraced the American, who has since visited the local herring museum and tasted a favorite local delicacy, putrefied shark.Sirry Laxdal, a receptionist at the Hotel Siglo in Siglufjordur, said Mr. Santillan was amused by his unexpected fame.He was really surprised when I told him this morning that he was famous in Iceland now, she was quoted by Visir as saying. He thought it was funny.Some Icelandic news outlets have been tracking Mr. Santillans journey with the zeal usually accorded to visiting dignitaries, and he has been interviewed on Icelands public broadcaster.Local news media noted that Laugavegur was misspelled on many travel websites and that some locals also struggled with the name of the popular shopping street. In Mr. Santillans case, the name appears to have been misspelled on the booking confirmation he received.Some Icelanders took to social media to applaud the serendipity of his trip. Love when tourists make the very best out of their wrong trip like Noel Santillan, Rosa Katrin, an Icelandic lawyer, wrote on Twitter."}
{"text": "Public housing agencies are asking for more time and resources to put in effect a proposed federal ban on smoking that would affect nearly one million households nationwide.Officials with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said they had heard from the agencies, public health organizations and residents in more than 1,000 comments received over 60 days on a proposed federal rule to ban smoking inside public housing units. The officials, who announced the proposal in November, are now reviewing those comments before finalizing the rule.The New York City Housing Authority, the largest in the country with 178,000 apartments spread among 328 sites, is asking for three years, rather than the proposed 18 months, to put the ban in place. The first two years would be for an education campaign, with the enactment of the ban to follow in the third year.In her comments, Shola Olatoye, chairwoman of the authority, said that residents had shown support for a ban in surveys but that the prohibition must be phased in gradually and with widespread resident embrace.Other public housing officials said the ban was too tall a task if additional federal funds were not provided to educate residents, offer smoking cessation programs and ensure compliance.The Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, representing administrators from about 1,900 authorities, said absent additional money, voluntary smoke-free policies were a more realistic option.The rule is an unfunded mandate which adds considerable burden, financially and administratively, to programs that have consistently received wholly inadequate funding, wrote Timothy G. Kaiser, the associations executive director.HUD officials said the proposed ban was an effort to protect residents from secondhand smoke, reduce the risk of fire and lower overall maintenance costs. More than 600 public housing agencies, or about 20 percent of 3,200, have banned indoor smoking since 2009 when the federal department began pressing for smoke-free policies.The proposed rule would require housing agencies to ban lit cigarettes, cigars and pipes in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices and all outdoor areas within 25 feet of housing and office buildings. (HUD is seeking feedback on whether to ban electronic cigarettes and water pipes.)Enforcement is a major concern. Federal officials say they want to avoid evictions, but the ban would be included in leases, and smoking violations would be treated like other nuisance violations.The public housing directors association noted that those with mobility problems, such as older adults and people with disabilities and mental illnesses, might end up being the most vulnerable to evictions if they continued smoking at home.In New York, Ms. Olatoye is adamant that enforcement would be handled by staff and not the police, who have a large presence in many housing projects and have had a significant  and sometimes contentious  role in enforcing the housing authoritys rules.In an interview, Ms. Olatoye said she had already had discussions with the citys health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett, to collaborate on educational campaigns that emphasized a healthy living perspective rather than, she said, were going to come after you if we smell smoke.In her own comments to HUD, Dr. Bassett joined numerous health and medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association, in praising the effort to promote smoke-free housing. She said the citys 311 help line received hundreds of calls from New Yorkers every month complaining about smoke drifting from one apartment to another.These complaints are consistent with studies showing elevated levels of cotinine, Dr. Bassett wrote, a biomarker for smoke exposure, in 57 percent of nonsmoking New York City residents, indicating secondhand smoke exposure.She recommended making the rule even tougher and including the smoking of hookahs or water pipes, whose popularity, she said, has increased sharply in recent years, particularly among youth.Health officials said alternatives, such as separating smokers or improving building ventilation, would not eliminate the ills of secondhand smoke, which include higher risk of asthma, heart disease and lung cancer.Still, reaction among residents of public housing has been mixed, and some opponents of the ban take exception to the government telling people what to do in the privacy of their home.This will be another way for the police to harass people living in poverty, one commenter wrote. If you are an adult you should be able to choose whether you want to smoke or not.But another commenter, who identified himself as a resident of the Binghamton Housing Authority, in Broome County, N.Y., wrote, Finally!The entire buildings smell of cigarette smoke, he added. We need clean air."}
{"text": "IN late 1982, I was watching the heavyweight championship fight between Larry Holmes and Randall Cobb, known as Tex, on television. Even though I was a longtime fan of pretty much every sport, I was appalled by the ceaseless violence that the referee permitted to be inflicted on Cobb. As a pathologist who had autopsied hundreds of people, I knew the kind of damage the fight could be causing. I wasnt the only one horrified by the spectacle: Howard Cosell, who was calling the fight, asked, I wonder if that referee understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that hes a part of?I decided to do something. At the time, I was the editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association, and on Jan. 14, 1983, we ran my editorial, Boxing Should Be Banned in Civilized Countries. The column garnered attention from around the world, and over the next few years, organized medicine, including the A.M.A. itself, rallied to the cause of abolishing the sport. Congress held hearings, some state laws were changed, championship fights were shortened, efforts were made to empower ringside doctors to stop fights and pre-fight examinations of boxers became more stringent.But mostly, parents, children and the public were put on notice that boxing was dangerous. The sport gradually lost its exalted status, becoming a marginal activity in this country.On Jan. 9, I had a similar feeling watching the National Football League wild-card game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals. An outrageous helmet-to-helmet hit by the Steeler Ryan Shazier gave Giovani Bernard a concussion, but astonishingly, it didnt result in a penalty  the hit was apparently within the rules. The Bengalss Vontaze Burficts savage shoulder-to-helmet hit on the defenseless wide receiver Antonio Brown caused another concussion (he couldnt play in the next weeks divisional playoff), but at least Burficts recklessness drew a three-game suspension.The negative publicity surrounding the game was more evidence that, despite its colossal cultural and economic success, the N.F.L. is in deep trouble, and cant seem to find a way out. The still accumulating evidence of brain-damaged former players  Ken Stabler, who died in July, is the most recent one to show evidence of brain trauma  is a huge legal liability. The failure of the league to take effective actions to protect the brains of current players puts it into willful-negligence territory. Other than increasing some on-field penalties, the league has done almost nothing to protect players now or in the future. And the sports media are mostly shills paid by the networks to entertain audiences and please the league, with little interest in using their pulpit for the cause of player safety.If the N.F.L. cant effectively deal with the concussion issue, it may follow the same arc as boxing. That would be a shame. I have had a love affair with American football, especially Alabama football, since 1944, the legendary Harry Gilmers first year. The only thing I love more than football is the human brain. Blows to the head damage the brain, period. It need not be a full concussion. We learned from decades of studying boxing that multiple sub-concussive blows result in aggregate widespread tearing of nerve fibers and small blood vessels, and possibly to chronic traumatic encephalopathy.At a bare minimum, the N.F.L. should publicly admit that there is a real problem with the risk of player brain damage (as it has in court documents). It should follow the lead of college football, which now punishes offending players with immediate expulsions from the game. (For pro football players, many of them multimillionaires, fines and suspensions assessed days after the game seem to have little impact.) For years, the league has experimented with ways to make the games faster and more exciting, so it could certainly consider changing rules to make the game safer by, for example, making the field larger or imposing weight restrictions on players.Why dont I call for footballs abolition, as I did with boxing? In part, I admit, because of my own bias toward football, but also because I believe that violence is a byproduct of football  one that can be reduced  not the intended result, as was the case for boxing. But the motivations of reformers like me are irrelevant. Parents are being made aware of the dangers of football and the potential for long-term disability, so they can (or not) give informed consent for their children. If large numbers of young people stop playing the game, as they stopped boxing, the talent pool will begin to dry up and the N.F.L. will have a smaller reservoir of talent and fans to tap.That may seem inconceivable for football now, when more than 100 million Americans will watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, but no more so than it once was for boxing. In 1982, I wrote: Some have argued that boxing has a redeeming social value in that it allows a few disadvantaged or minority individuals an opportunity to rise to spectacular wealth and fame. This does occur, but at what price? The price in this country includes chronic brain damage for them and the thousands of others who do not achieve wealth, fame, or even a decent living from the ring.One could easily make the same observation about football today, at all levels. The future of the sport hinges on whether any serious rule changes can ameliorate the brain damage. Professional boxing in the United States couldnt be rescued. Given the inaction by the owners and commissioner of the N.F.L., I dont know that football can, either."}
{"text": "In his classic tome Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga declared that genuine, pure play is one of the main bases of civilization. If thats true, then the art-making team of Fischli and Weiss  Peter Fischli (born in 1952) and David Weiss (19462012)  have been among the contemporary worlds eminently civilizing influences. Few other artists have been more infectiously playful than this Swiss duo, as visitors to the Guggenheim Museum will be delighted to find in  Peter Fischli David Weiss: How to Work Better.Organized by Nancy Spector, the museums chief curator, and Nat Trotman, its curator of performance and media, in collaboration with Mr. Fischli, the show presents more than 300 sculptures, photographs, slide projections and videos. This marvelously entertaining exhibition demonstrates the power of creative fooling around to invigorate and free hearts and minds.Fischli and Weisss ludic spirit emerged fully formed with their first collaboration, in Zurich in 1979, in a series of photographs of doll-scale tableaus  a car accident, a fashion show, a rug store  made mostly from bologna, knackwurst, salami and other processed meats.At that point Mr. Fischli and Mr. Weiss didnt consider themselves a team. But the refreshing irreverence toward calcified pieties of high art and culture that would drive all their subsequent efforts was succinctly embodied in these sweetly comical and deceptively unassuming pictures.Meeting up again, in Los Angeles in 1980, the artists gave their antiheroic impulses expression in a 45-minute movie starring two anthropomorphic animals, Rat and Bear, played by the artists wearing frowzy, whole-body costumes rented from a Hollywood costume shop. Shot in Super 8, The Least Resistance (198081) is a hoot, a picaresque tale about a couple of lazy, irritable, scheming, self-deluding lowlifes. They drive around through city and countryside, visit an art gallery, walk in nature and lounge around a pool. Along the way, they squabble over minor differences and pontificate philosophically in gravelly German. At one point, Rat experiences vividly colorful psychedelic hallucinations. Later, he writes on a typewriter, Beauty is not always true, and truth is not always beautiful, unfortunately.A second film, The Right Way (1983), came two years later in Switzerland. In this movie, Rat and Bear wander through bucolic landscapes, into the depths of a cavern and over a glacier in the Swiss Alps, arguing and holding forth on high-minded topics.The Fischli and Weiss partnership was furthered solidified when they were invited by a Zurich gallery to fill in for an artist who had dropped out of a scheduled show. Given six weeks to come up with something, the artists embarked on an absurdly ambitious project: to represent in small, clay sculptures all of world knowledge and history as they understood and imagined it. At deadline, they delivered about 180 works in gray, unfired clay, each a small, more-or-less crude rendering of an idea or a historical or imaginary event. Repetition and Difference, presents two lumpy, smiling figures in hats who are similar but not exactly, as one is bigger than the other. Down and Out has Mickey Mouse with a liquor bottle lying drunk on a sidewalk. The First Potatoes Arrive in Europe consists of 10 finely rendered tubers and a bowl.In ensuing years, Fischli and Weiss added to the series, titled Suddenly an Overview, eventually producing about 600 pieces. The show presents over 160. Titles convey the series goofy flavor: Jesus Walks on Water, the Fishes are Amazed; Seven Aliens Marvel and Stonehenge; and Mick Jagger and Brian Jones Going Home Satisfied After Composing I Cant Get No Satisfaction.In 1984, the pair went back to the kitchen, where, as they did with their meat pictures, they gathered knives, forks, spoons, cooking utensils and other implements found in the home and used them to build precariously balanced constructions. Examples in the exhibition play wittily on Cubist sculpture and formalist photography of the early 20th century. These led to Fischli and Weisss masterpiece, their riveting, justly famous 30-minute film The Way Things Go (1987).The movie presents close-up views of an apparently continuous series of chain reactions of a Rube Goldberg-type machine of indeterminate length consisting of countless ordinary objects. At the start, a suspended, revolving stuffed garbage bag nudges a tire, which rolls into an unstable construction of lumber and hardware, causing it to collapse as the tire rolls on into another assemblage that also falls apart, setting off further causes and effects. Fire, explosives, spilling water, flammable liquids, foaming chemicals and deflating balloons combine with gravity to keep the action going. Its enthralling and curiously suspenseful to see what happens from moment to moment. While the film looks as if it was made in one long take, in fact it is the result of artful editing of many different, separately shot parts, and it took two years to produceAround the same time, these artists also began carving and painting realistic sculptures of mundane objects from polyurethane foam. They organized scores of them  including a skull, a small cannon, an oil drum, a life preserver and a pink sow suckling piglets  on a platform of fake wood planks and called it The Raft (1982). Installed in the museums topmost tower gallery, its surrounded by swimming crocodiles, making it a darkly comic allegory of a world on the brink of  or after  apocalypse.The artists cast in black rubber objects like a dogs dish, a leather ottoman, several different cabinets, an enormous tree root and Mens Items (198687), which represents an electric shaver and lotion bottles. Thus, the defamiliarization of the overly familiar.From the 1990s on, following the lead of Jasper Johnss famous trompe loeil painted bronze sculpture Savarin Can With Brushes (1960), Fischli and Weiss concentrated on replicating in painted polyurethane foam all the kinds of objects populating their studio: paint buckets, shopping bags, cassette tapes, bottles of all sorts, electric tools, tables, chairs, pedestals and much more. For gallery exhibitions they installed these in such a way that visitors might think an installation was underway, as I thought when I peeked into a show at Sonnabend Gallery in the early 90s. In the present exhibition, these works are arranged into different installations, some of which consist of hundreds of objects on and under tables and pedestals. Fascinating to peruse in detail, they seem to hover between actual reality and virtual reality.Fischli and Weiss extended their shared preoccupation with modern mundanity into travel photography. While flying around the world, they took thousands of pictures of generically lovely landscapes and, taking a page from Ed Ruschas Thirty-Four Parking Lots in Los Angeles (1967), anonymous scenes in airports. In the Guggenheim exhibition their photographs are presented as mesmerizing slide shows on flat screens.Complementing the travel photography are half-life-size sculptures of airline stewardesses and boxy cars. Rendered in white plaster, they have a chilly, spectral presence, archetypes of modern anonymity. The artists grandest realization of this theme now stands on the plaza in front of the Guggenheim. Called Haus (1987), its a lovingly detailed, one-fifth-scale model of an office building with greenish glass windows, concrete walls and metal framing. Verging on Magrittean Surrealism, its a monument to modern architectural banality.During the last four years of their partnership, Fischli and Weiss took a Minimalist turn, creating extremely simple sculptures in unfired clay and cast black rubber in the forms of tubes, three-sided corners and slabs. Installed in the museums gallery just off the ramp near the ground floor, they are surprisingly elegant, and, considering Mr. Weisss recent death, they cast a touching funereal spell. The mood is enhanced by a wall projection of a cameras view of traveling endlessly through a tubular space  in fact, robotically videotaped views of the Zurich sewer system that the artists acquired from city authorities. Despite its lowly source, the film is hauntingly beautiful, a cosmic journey to the ends of the universe."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  From London to Athens, Europe is questioned. Some people, mainly refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, are dying to get into the European Union. Many British conservatives are fighting to get out of it. Others, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, plot to undermine it. Yet others are bored by it: The 20th century and the strategic imperatives behind NATO and the European Union seem far away to wired millennials.The two most powerful symbols of European integration  the euro that binds 19 European Union states in a common currency and the Schengen accords that allow people to move freely among 22 European Union nations  are in danger of unraveling under the pressure of polarized politics, diverging economic performance and the influx of more than one million desperate migrants and refugees in the past year.There is an identity crisis. Christian Europe, a notion that Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary has turned into a kind of illusory fetish, is in fact much less Christian. Around 6 percent of the European population is Muslim today; by 2030 that figure will be 8 percent.A small minority of those Muslims  told by online jihadist propagandists that there is no gray zone between Islam and the infidel, only the obligation to slaughter the unbeliever  drift off via Turkey to ISIS-held territory in Syria and return to kill  Charlie Hebdo, the Paris kosher supermarket, Paris sports and music halls and restaurants, the Brussels Jewish museum. Division and demagogy spread. Xenophobic rightist parties thrive at the margins from Sweden to Greece.At Cologne and Stockholm stations, in the two countries that have overwhelmingly taken in the most refugees, two rampages  by asylum seekers against women in Germany and by masked nationalist thugs against refugee children in Sweden  illustrate the tensions.Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, recently told my colleague Jim Yardley: This is not Europe. This is a nightmare. That nightmare is one of looming fragmentation, violence and walls for the half-billion people now moving freely between Warsaw and Lisbon.It can be averted. The Europe of today is not the Europe of the 1930s. In Berlin, Angela Merkel stands tall, a European leader of immense stature. Still, the fissuring pressures are intense.Sometimes, as Yeats noted, the falcon cannot hear the falconer. We live in an age of unraveling. The postwar is over. The post-Cold War is over. The United States, under President Obama, has quietly stepped back from Europe. Washington is nowhere to be seen on the refugee crisis, the absent power, much as it was absent from the Minsk process on the Ukraine crisis.The world is most dangerous in a power vacuum. The geopolitical divides across the world are the most marked in at least a generation. This makes every issue more intractable. The United Nations has proved a complete dud on Syria. It took almost five years, 250,000 dead and more than 11 million displaced people for the Security Council to pass a resolution on a road map to peace. That map, for now, is utter fiction. For as many years, Obama did nothing.Now refugees stream from Syria and elsewhere into Europe. If they carry a banner, it should read, Reap what you sow, feckless world. A digital migration of epic proportions is underway. Each refugee has a smartphone and knows his or her desired destination.From this New Europe to New Hampshire, unpredictable forces are at play. Show me a Donald Trump, even a slightly Iowa-humbled one, and Ill see you with a Marine Le Pen.The strange thing is this troubled Europe has rescued the United States. Thats new. Without Merkels courageous decision to take in 1.1 million refugees last year, Europe would have faced catastrophe  and America, even in an election year, could not have ignored violent mayhem among its allies as borders closed and huddled masses yearning to breathe free were cast adrift.Another 65,000 refugees arrived in Germany in January, setting the country on course for 780,000 more this year. Some 200,000 mainly Muslim children are entering German schools. Imagine if America, which has four times the German population, were to register 800,000 mainly Muslim children in schools in a few months. On reflection, dont even try.Nobody knows what Germanys limit is. But there is one. Merkels Christian Democratic Union will turn on her if the numbers keep rising. Other European nations are not going to take significant quotas: Theres scant democratic support for the right and ethical thing to do.So Germany has to cut a deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The deal will probably see Turkey getting piles of cash  and perhaps the visa waiver that Turks desperately want from Germany  in exchange for Turkey strictly curtailing the flow of refugees to an agreed number who would not have to risk their lives in flimsy boats.Turkish politics have become German domestic politics. A troubled Europe, cast loose from America, slouches toward Ankara to be saved."}

A timetable for Stewarts return has not been determined, but the team said he was expected to make a full recovery and race this year.Drivers report to Daytona next week to begin preparations for the season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 21. An interim driver for the No. 14 Chevrolet was not named Thursday.In 2013, Denny Hamlin sustained a compression fracture to his L1 vertebra and missed four races. But even after his return, he struggled with back pain the rest of the season.Stewart will miss what was expected to be his final Daytona 500. He is 0-17 in the prestigious race and spoke last month about how it is one of the few glaring holes on his rsum. Stewart, who turns 45 in May, plans to retire from Nascar competition at the end of this year.Stewart was with Greg Biffle and other Nascar personalities on an A.T.V. outing in the Southern California desert when he crashed. The team said he was awake and alert as he was taken to a hospital, and he was able to move all of his extremities.Stewart flew to North Carolina late Tuesday and remained hospitalized Thursday.This is yet another setback in the final stages of one of the most storied careers in racing. Stewart has slumped since breaking his leg in a 2013 sprint car accident. A year later, he missed three races while in seclusion after his car struck and killed a fellow driver, Kevin Ward Jr., at a dirt track in New York. Stewart was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, but faces a civil suit from Wards family.Stewart has not won a race since 2013, before he broke his leg, and was 28th in the final Sprint Cup standings last year. He had only three top-10 finishes and 24 laps led, both career lows, and readily admitted his confidence was shot.A crew chief change was made for this season  the fourth different team leader Stewart will have since he won the 2011 title  and he hoped a new Nascar rules package would better fit his driving style and make him competitive in this final hurrah.No matter what happened this year, Stewart insisted last month this would be his final Nascar season.If its a terrible year, Im not going to sit there and go, Wow, that defined my career, because the stats will show what we did over 18 years, Stewart said. I think no matter how the season goes, Im going to be able to say I had a successful run in the Sprint Cup Series."}

Claims that the Greek-owned ship was boarded last week by separatists espousing an independent state of Biafra in southeast Nigeria are probably a cover to lend legitimacy to a kidnapping for ransom, said Dirk Steffen, the maritime security director of Denmark-based Risk Intelligence. The hijackers abandoned the ship Sunday and took five hostages with them, he said. A man who identified himself by the nom-de-guerre General Ben  similar to titles used by Niger Delta militants  had threatened to blow up the ship with its crew if the authorities did not release Nnamdi Kanu, the director of the banned Radio Biafra, detained since Oct. 17 and accused of terrorism.

{"text": "The employment report for January, released on Friday, plays into the old joke about economists: Give me a one-handed economist, President Harry Truman once said. All my economists say on the one hand.on the other.On the one hand, job growth slowed in January, to 151,000, compared to over 250,000 in December and in November. On the other hand, average job gains for the past six months and the past 12 months remain over 200,000, indicating steady if unspectacular growth.On the one hand, the official unemployment rate ticked down last month, to 4.9 percent from 5 percent in December. On the other hand, the broader underemployment measure, which includes a larger swath of jobless workers plus part-time workers who need full-time jobs, remained stuck at 9.9 percent, indicating substantial slack in the job market.On the one hand, average hourly wages were up 2.5 percent over the last year, compared to an annual pace of 2 percent previously. On the other hand, the gains are powered in part by more people working at low-wage jobs in retail, restaurants and health care and by raises last month in some states minimum wages, indicating employment without prosperity.It has become customary to scour economic reports for clues as to what the Federal Reserve will do next  continue to raise interest rates, hold them steady or cut them? The only conclusion to be drawn from the January jobs report is that the Fed will have to wait for Februarys report to get a clearer sense of what is going on.In the meantime, incoming data will show how slower global growth and recent market volatility are affecting the United States. It is hard to imagine how the nation could avoid negative knock-on effects. The question is how severe those effects may be.Another question is whether Congress will ever do its duty to aid the economy. A big reason all eyes turn to the Fed for answers and action is that the Republican-led Congress has removed itself from the picture, refusing to provide, or actively blocking, timely and adequate investment that only government can offer in infrastructure, education, the environment, scientific research, social services and many other areas.As a result, the economy is not as strong as it could be, the people not as secure and the future not as bright."}
{"text": "Dog collars, whether circlets made of precious metal or spiked leather straps, can yield insights into socioeconomic history and family tragedies. This year collars with poignant back stories are surfacing at museums and on the market.At a Bonhams sale of canine art and artifacts in New York on Feb. 17, a silver collar made in 1883 for a Scotch collie named Help is estimated to sell for $2,500 to $3,500.Help, a shaggy black dog with imploring eyes and streaks of white across his face and chest, was taken to fund-raisers in Britain and France for charities assisting the children of railway workers who had died on the job. The dog was outfitted with a piggy bank, and a tag on his collar had a London address where donations would be thankfully received & duly acknowledged. Helps image appeared on badges with the slogan Help Our Noble Railway Dog, and proceeds from sales of the badges went to orphanages.He brought in thousands of dollars. Journalists observed that Help somehow knew to focus on begging from people who were elegantly dressed, and that he seemed to smile a little when coins were handed over. After his death in 1891 at the age of 13, a railway magazine ran a eulogy: No dog probably lived a more useful life than did Help. His taxidermied body was displayed at the train station in Brighton, England.Helps owner, John Climpson, eventually bequeathed the silver collar and tag to a friend. The Bonhams lot had long belonged to a California family that acquired it from a London gallery in 1967 for about $85.Bonhams has handled the sales of other collars from celebrated dogs. In 2010, a leather-and-brass collar that Charles Dickens used on a pet (possibly a Newfoundland) sold for $11,590 at a New York auction. In 2012, a brass-and-leather collar from Joe, a sled-pulling husky who died in 1903 during an expedition to Antarctica, brought around $12,000 at Bonhams in London.In recent years, a number of institutions have increased their holdings of dog collars.In Britain, taxidermied dogs from other railroad charity campaigns have gone on view along with vintage collars and piggy banks at the Bluebell Railway Museum at Sheffield Park Station, the Natural History Museum in Tring, the train station in Slough and the National Railway Museum in York. (Dr. Oliver Betts, a research fellow for the National Railway Museum, said the whereabouts of Helps body are unknown; it may have been destroyed in World War II bombings or station modernizations in the 1960s.)Leeds Castle in Maidstone displays about 135 dog collars, some dating to the 1400s and sometimes sprouting iron spikes that protected the wearers necks from predators. The castles curator, Annie Kemkaran-Smith, said that its collection adds an element of pleasant surprise to tours of the medieval estate.The American Kennel Club Museum of the Dog in St. Louis owns two dozen collars; one is believed to have come from a Tibetan mastiff owned by British royals. The National Sporting Library & Museum in Middleburg, Va., has received 187 dog collars from Timothy J. Greenan, a radiologist. He donated, among other artifacts, a silver circlet from Tiffany & Company that adorned the tiny pet of a wealthy 19th-century Manhattan orphan named Laura Pelton, and a black leather collar worn by German shepherds carrying messages for German troops during World War I. The National Sporting Library staff plans to exhibit the collection alongside paintings and sculptures that depict animals wearing similar collars.William Secord, a Manhattan dealer who specializes in paintings of dogs, said that collectors sometimes fill entire walls with canine collars and pay up to tens of thousands of dollars each for examples with elite pedigrees. Its all about the emotional draw, he said.A red leather collar with dangling metal bells, on view at A La Vieille Russie gallery in Manhattan, was worn by a French bulldog named Bobtail. It belonged to Grand Duchess Olga, the youngest sibling of Russias last czar, Nicholas II. Bulldogs were a favorite breed for the Romanovs. Grand Duchess Tatiana, Olgas niece and Nicholass daughter, had her bulldog by her side when she and her family members were executed by the Bolsheviks. The dog was killed, too.A red sandstone eagle, surrounded by carvings of weapons and flags, has been perched on the windswept rim of a masonry fort on Governors Island for 220 years. National Park Service crews are repairing the tableau, parts of which toppled during Hurricane Sandy.The monument was installed around 1796 atop Fort Jays gateway. A wheeled cannon and a shield emblazoned with sun rays are arranged around the eagles talons. Government records show that an artist named Le beau was paid $200 to create the tableau. Nothing is known about the sculptor, whom Judy Jacob, a senior conservator at the National Park Service, called an exquisitely talented carver.She described his work as the first monumental free-standing stone sculpture to have been carved in the United States.No one knows who commissioned the piece, she added, but it must have been someone or some people of means and sway.Few descriptions and images survive from the sculptures early years; the island was a military base, off limits to tourists, historians and artists. Even in the 18th century, no one writes about it, Ms. Jacob said.Stone flags on the sculpture shattered during Hurricane Sandy. Steve Boyle, a mason for the National Park Service, is carving replacements out of sandstone chunks recycled from a dismantled bridge in New Haven.Ms. Jacob has also studied a handful of other 18th-century outdoor monuments that were installed in Manhattan. A gilded lead statue of George III on horseback, at Bowling Green, was pulled down by mobs in 1776. The New-York Historical Society owns a fragment of the horses tail, sculpted with realistic tangled strands."}

{"text": "When scientists first started to figure out how to extract DNA from ancient skeletons, their success was met with astonishment. One minute, scientists were fishing Richard IIIs genes from his royal bones, and the next they were showing off DNA retrieved from 5,00-year-old Incan mummies.The idea that DNA could survive for thousands of years  let alone be reassembled into an entire genome  seemed little short of miraculous.Despite the fields rapid advances in recent years, though, ancient DNA is still hard to find and hard to make sense of. Potential errors lurk around every corner. Even little oversights can cause big headaches.Andrea Manica, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, appreciates this fact all too well. A head-turning study by his team turned out to have a fundamental flaw that erased some of its most provocative conclusions.In October, Dr. Manica and his colleagues reconstructed the first ancient human genome ever found in Africa, retrieved from the skeleton of a man who lived in Ethiopia 4,500 years ago.Ancient DNA experts were delighted, because the genome may provide clues about African history that other kinds of evidence  broken pottery shards, for example, or scraps of ancient manuscripts  cannot.Its an amazing, amazing, unique, special, incredible, first-of-its-kind data set, David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, said in an interview.After Dr. Manica and his colleagues published their results, Dr. Reich and Pontus Skoglund, another geneticist at Harvard, requested the original data. They wanted to use it in their own studies of ancient human populations.Dr. Reich and Dr. Skoglund reanalyzed the findings  but did not reach the same conclusions.In the original study, Dr. Manica and his colleagues sought to understand how the ancient Ethiopian man (dubbed Mota, after the cave where his body was buried) was related to other humans. The researchers found many unique mutations that linked Mota to a group of Ethiopians who live near the cave today, known as the Ari.By contrast, the researchers found that Mota was only distantly related to many people elsewhere in Africa. In fact, the analysis suggested that most living Africans shared some DNA with Europeans and Asians that were missing from Motas genome.To explain these intriguing results, Dr. Manica and his colleagues tested out different historical scenarios. In the best-supported one, a group of people migrated from the Near East back to East Africa  a so-called backflow  about 3,000 years ago. In subsequent generations, their DNA spread across Africa.But some of the implications of this theory were surprising. For one thing, this backflow seemed to have raged like a flood, spreading all the way across the continent in relatively little time.Those provocative implications drew wide attention in the media, including The Times. Unfortunately, Dr. Skoglund and Dr. Reich couldnt find any trace of the migration beyond East Africa.Once Dr. Manica learned of the conundrum, he and his colleagues retraced their steps.They discovered that they had neglected to take one small but essential step in their analysis. It was clear human error, said Dr. Manica in an interview. Its just something that should have been done that didnt get done.The DNA in a bone thousands of years old has broken into little fragments. After scientists retrieve those fragments, they must fit the pieces back together like a jigsaw puzzle.One way to do a jigsaw puzzle is to refer to the picture on the box. Similarly, scientists working with ancient gene fragments refer to a standard reference genome to figure out what goes where. That requires software designed to reassemble DNA fragments in as little time as possible.As it turns out, the data produced by the program used to map Motas DNA came in a format that had to be tweaked before the scientists used a second program to compare it with other genomes. In the Mota study, no one did the tweaking.That little oversight had a big impact. Dr. Manica and his colleagues unknowingly ignored some spots in the genome where Motas DNA was identical to that of Eurasians. As a result, Mota appeared not to be as closely related to Eurasians as he really was.The mistake also created the false impression that many Africans outside of East Africa shared a lot of genes with Eurasians, DNA not found in Motas genome.Dr. Manica and his colleagues last week posted a statement about the error, which was first reported in the journal Nature. They have asked Science, where their study appeared, to publish an erratum, and the journal is considering it.Still, Dr. Reich noted, other parts of the original study, such as the reconstructed sequence of the Mota genome, stood up to scrutiny. The Ari do appear to be close kin to Mota.Whats more, the Eurasian backflow did indeed occur  but only East Africans carry DNA from that event. At least the general story still stands, said Dr. Manica.The Mota genome will remain an important resource for scientists studying human history. Dr. Manica and his colleagues, for example, are using it to study how humans expanded from Africa into Europe and Asia more than 50,000 years ago.Dr. Manica and Dr. Reich agreed that ancient DNA experts needed to be willing to share their analyses to catch such errors in the future.Its so scary to work with this kind of data, said Dr. Reich. Im sure well make a mistake at some point, too."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   President Obamas budget request to Congress will include a new fee on oil companies, requiring them to pay $10 to the federal government for every barrel of oil they produce, the White House said on Thursday.The money, which could bring in up to $32 billion in new federal revenue annually, would be spent on a variety of transportation and infrastructure projects, including bridges and highways, high-speed rail and research on advanced vehicles such as electric and self-driving cars.The proposal to further increase costs for fossil fuel production is part of a broader effort by Mr. Obama to fight climate change. The goal is to make it more expensive to produce and consume energy sources that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases while stoking the market for clean, renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar.About 30 percent of the nations greenhouse gas emissions come from vehicles, and investing in high-speed rail and cleaner vehicles could help lower those emissions.This new approach to investment and funding is one that places a priority on reducing greenhouse gases, while working to develop a more integrated, sophisticated and sustainable transportation sector, the White House said in a statement.The latest climate change moves are aimed particularly at slowing fossil fuel production. Last month, the Interior Department announced plans to halt new leases of coal mines on public lands while it conducts a study that could result in higher fees for companies that extract coal on federal property.Oil prices are at their lowest point in more than a decade, which some policy makers believe provides an opportunity to minimize the impact of such a fee on consumers. But oil companies, whose profits have declined significantly with the price of oil, are likely to fight back hard, as will Republicans in Congress, who have consistently blocked any efforts to raise taxes.The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, attacked the proposal. Once again, the president expects hardworking consumers to pay for his out-of-touch climate agenda, he said in a statement. The good news is this plan is little more than an election-year distraction. As this lame-duck president knows, its dead on arrival in Congress.Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said, Make no mistake, this is an energy consumer tax disguised as an oil company fee.Still, the proposal could have some backers who are concerned about the federal Highway Trust Fund, which pays for construction and maintenance of the nations roads and bridges and has been on the brink of insolvency. The highway fund comes from an 18.4-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, which Congress has not raised since 1993.The fee raises the funding necessary to make these new investments, while also providing for the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund to ensure we maintain the infrastructure we have, the White House statement said.Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of the White Houses National Economic Council, noted that there had been growing bipartisan interest in shoring up the nations crumbling infrastructure.People call for more transportation investment but never talk about how theyll pay for it, he said. We need major new investments and a long-term funding solution."}
{"text": "Mayor Bill de Blasios peculiar and controversial crusade to limit the Manhattan horse-carriage industry abruptly collapsed on Thursday, dealing a blow to his image at the expense of a political pursuit that many of his allies had hoped he would abandon long ago.Despite personal pleas from Mr. de Blasio himself, the New York City Council canceled a vote on his bill to confine the industrys horses to Central Park, a priority of wealthy donors that the mayor kept alive, despite scorn from labor unions, parks advocates, pedicab drivers and other groups.The collapse immediately overshadowed Mr. de Blasios State of the City address, where he had planned to trumpet accomplishments and declare goals for the future. The speech, scheduled for Thursday evening to reach a wider audience, was part of an effort by City Hall to move past the unforced errors that have become an unwelcome hallmark of the mayors tenure.Instead, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, found himself faced with defeat on another quixotic political quest of his own making.The collapse of the legislation came after the Teamsters union pulled its support on Thursday, saying its carriage-driver members believed the future of their industry would be endangered. The bill would have reduced the number of horses in the industry and devoted more than $25 million to renovating a Central Park stable as the animals new home.Mr. de Blasio had lobbied lawmakers on the plan, occasionally in blunt terms, saying the deal was personally important to him, according to several people told of his conversations.It was a significant use of political capital on an issue that was notably distant from Mr. de Blasios core mission of curbing inequality. But the horse carriages were a target of animal-rights activists, who spent about $1 million attacking his chief opponent in the 2013 Democratic primary for mayor, Christine C. Quinn, and who have continued to finance his endeavors.The mayor, who pledged to ban the industry on Day 1 of his administration, said he believed that it was inhumane to make horses traverse Midtown streets. He also made clear that he wanted to show he could stick to his word.But Mr. de Blasio had little support in his cause. Although the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, ultimately supported the compromise, the plan was met with wide skepticism.Parks advocates questioned the use of parkland for a private concern. Pedicab drivers said they would be ruined by a clause in the plan barring them from operating in parts of Central Park. One labor union this week said it would consider a lawsuit to stop it.In the end, Mr. de Blasios isolation on the horse plan was underscored, in ignominious fashion, during an extraordinary scene at City Hall on Thursday morning. The mayor arrived at 11:30 a.m. in his sport-utility vehicle to find a jubilant crowd of horse-carriage drivers, celebrating the death of his plan.For about 15 minutes, Mr. de Blasio huddled inside the car, conferring with aides as reporters and television cameras gathered. When the mayor finally emerged, he pledged, defiantly, to find a way forward.Theres a lot of people who believe that it does not make sense to have horse carriages on the streets of Midtown Manhattan, and that having them in the park was a good idea, the mayor told reporters.The Teamsters, Mr. de Blasio said, didnt keep to their agreement  its as simple as that.The mayors office said that on Thursday morning the legislation had the votes needed to pass. But many council members never quite warmed to the mayors effort, and the backing of the Teamsters was seen as critical to secure support for a bill that would effectively eliminate some unionized jobs.There were many members, including myself, who had always said that the only way I could ever support a compromise was if the Teamsters were a party to and supported the deal, said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Queens Democrat.Once the Teamsters pulled out, Mr. Van Bramer added, they knew they didnt have the votes and they had to pull the bill.Some lawmakers had been prepared to support the compromise simply to move it off their plate, saying Mr. de Blasios plan had become a painful distraction.New York City politics is in danger of becoming just as much as a laughingstock as the presidential race, Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat, said on Thursday.Because the Council rarely votes on measures that are not assured of passage, the bills removal from the calendar for a vote on Friday is tantamount to its defeat.For Mr. de Blasio, the defeat is also a painful reminder of another legislative fiasco: his attempt to limit the expansion of the car-service app Uber. While the Council was deliberating, the mayor flew to Italy for an environmental conference at the Vatican; the bill died while he was returning to New York.This past weekend, Mr. de Blasio spent four days in Iowa, where he knocked on doors as a volunteer for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign. Back home, opposition to the horse plan was growing, as prominent leaders from the Transport Workers Union Local 100 and the Central Labor Council made calls opposing the legislation.Some last-minute sweeteners by the administration, including a promise that the citys tourism arm, NYC & Company, would promote the horse-carriage industry, failed to shore up union support.Its a great day for the horse and carriages, Ian McKeever, a carriage driver and spokesman for the industry, said on Thursday. Im from Dublin, so Im having a pint.Reached on his phone on Thursday, Steven Nislick, the de Blasio donor and animal-rights activist whose group, Nyclass, pushed for a horse-carriage ban, hung up without a word. In a statement released later, he and his Nyclass partner, Wendy Neu, called the collapse of the deal outrageous and wrong.Mr. Van Bramer, who as majority leader in the Council had been crucial to securing support for the deal based on the Teamsters participation, said it was time for the city to move on to other issues.This has gone on for too long, and I would say that there have been several attempts to do this, he said. They have not been successful, and we should move on to more pressing matters and more important issues that the people of the City of New York want us to focus on.For Mr. de Blasio, however, the quest continues.The people of this city know what I believe, the mayor wrote in a statement, and we will work toward a new path on this issue."}
{"text": "One month, four countries, two continents and a ton of shows later, the fall 2016 mens wear season had finally come to a close. But first, a drink.That was the gist at the after-party for the designer Todd Snyder, whose collection closed out New York Fashion Week: Mens on Thursday night, capping four packed days of runway shows, presentations and celebrations.It was a statement, Mr. Snyder said before entering the fray at Gilded Lily on West 15th Street, wearing a leather jacket and glasses and looking like someone who would be cast as a handsome Brooklyn dad in a commercial. We wanted to put a stake in the ground and say, Were here.Mr. Snyder was in good spirits, perhaps as a result of his brand being acquired by American Eagle in November, a move that will help him to focus on expansion, including a forthcoming Manhattan flagship similar to the one he maintains in Tokyo.It was a busy night for revelers, with Interview magazine holding court at Hotel Americano in Chelsea and the modeling agency Soul Artist Management celebrating at No. 8 in the meatpacking district.But downstairs at Gilded Lily, the crowd at Mr. Snyders party mirrored his brands aesthetic: one part woodsy outdoorsman, one part elegant gentleman  now stir. The mens wear shows are more relaxed than the womens (which start next week), and the amiable atmosphere reflected it.Early in the night, women in outfits that could be best described as sexy pirate maneuvered large trays of appetizers like bruschetta through the throngs of people sitting on banquettes and bobbing to the thumping music. And while the open bar was teeming, the watch brand Timex, which Mr. Snyder had teamed up with this season, vied for attention by offering free timepieces to partygoers, causing a bit of bottlenecking at the front of the room.A few blocks away at the celebrity haunt Up & Down, the party didnt start heating up until after midnight, when models were break-dancing to Top 40 hits under the flickering lights of chandeliers.While the party was ostensibly for the upstart brand Rochambeau, which had presented its streetwear-inflected collection earlier in the day, by 1 a.m. the designers had yet to make an appearance. That didnt stop the crowds from feverishly dancing and accumulating outside."}
{"text": "U.S. Soccers decision on Wednesday to sue the union representing the world champion United States womens national team came as a surprise to some of the players, many of whom were gathering in Texas for an Olympic qualifying tournament next week.But the players discovery that U.S. Soccers court filing included detailed personal information about many of them  including the home addresses of more than two dozen players and the personal email accounts of some of the teams most prominent players  brought a different reaction: outrage.Naturally, were upset, midfielder Megan Rapinoe said Thursday. The players are very, very upset. We feel disrespected. We feel that our personal information, our privacy and our safety was handled frivolously and with real negligence. I doubt it was purposeful, but its an egregious error, and one thats unacceptable.Were public figures. There have been issues of privacy and hacking and stalkers  its very unsettling. Were upset. To know that someone could show up at your door? Thats extremely unsettling, and its something that you cant get back.In the lawsuit, U.S. Soccer is arguing that the teams collective bargaining agreement with the federation, which expired at the end of 2012, remains in effect because of a memorandum of understanding that U.S. Soccer signed with the players representatives in March 2013. The unions leadership contends that it does not and that it can repudiate the agreement with 60 days notice.The disagreement reached a crisis point in a meeting between U.S. Soccer and the players union on Tuesday. When the union refused to agree in writing that it would not take any labor actions this year  an important one for the Americans, who are favored to win the gold medal at the Rio Olympics  U.S. Soccer filed the lawsuit in United States District Court in Chicago.Among the documents filed with the suit was a list of 28 national team players and their home addresses. The documents also contained email exchanges that disclosed the personal email addresses of some of the worlds most prominent athletes, including Rapinoe, forwards Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan, midfielder Carli Lloyd and goalkeeper Hope Solo.Ordinarily, that type of information would be redacted, especially in the case of public figures like professional athletes. U.S. Soccer said the disclosure was a clerical mistake.It was unintentional on the part of U.S. Soccers counsel, and a redacted version of the complaint has already been filed, the federation said in a statement. By Thursday afternoon, the redacted version, with the players personal details removed, had replaced the original on the courts website.The disclosure, while upsetting to the players and embarrassing for U.S. Soccer, did not necessarily reveal secrets, however. The same document, the players unions annual financial report for 2014, has been posted on the Department of Labors website for some time, and it was unclear if all of the two-year-old addresses were current.But from the players standpoint, the fact that their addresses were revealed in a court filing sure to attract attention was a bigger issue.I think the players all feel the same  its disrespectful and unacceptable, Rapinoe said. They had every opportunity to redact it. I know U.S. Soccer has outside counsel, but they have to know who the people involved are. They have to.Rich Nichols, the executive director and general counsel of the United States Womens National Soccer Team Players Association, said he had emailed U.S. Soccer on Thursday morning demanding that it address the disclosure of the players personal information.In a text message, Nichols said: This morning in an email from me to their general counsel, on behalf of the players, all of whom are very upset about the public disclosure of their private information, we expressed our deep disappointment and outrage that players personal email addresses and other private information was not redacted. They subsequently responded with an apology and commitment to immediately retract and redact the exhibits to delete players private information.But according to Rapinoe, the damage had been done. And to the players, privacy and safety concerns were not unfounded.In an interview with The Huffington Post during the national teams World Cup victory tour last fall, forward Sydney Leroux described a disturbing incident in which a male fan appeared on the players floor in a hotel.He pretty much got on an elevator with some of the girls and then came out on our floor, and thats not  we dont have anyone else on our floor aside from our team  so they called security and he ended up getting escorted out of the hotel, she said.To Rapinoe, the latest breach was worse.We understand mistakes happen, Rapinoe said, but this is one that cant happen."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Golden 50s cover this city. They glow from the waterfronts Ferry Building, hang from streetlights and cover 20 stories on downtown skyscrapers  all promoting the weeklong party that is the 50th Super Bowl, to be played on Sunday.But these festive trappings cannot mask the tensions that have roiled San Francisco in recent years  tensions that are coming to the surface as football fans flood into town and attend over-the-top pregame events. In a city divided over gentrification, sky-high housing prices and the technology industrys influence on local government, even the nations biggest party has become a battleground.The cost of hosting the Super Bowl  estimated at about $5 million for the city  has unleashed a storm of anger among residents already resentful of the influx of expensive restaurants, high-end stores and rich, young tech workers who have snapped up apartments in historically low-income neighborhoods. To tidy up for the tourists, the citys large homeless population has been swept out of view, which some people here see as evidence that this city, long a seat of leftist activism, has sold itself to corporate interests.I dont think the taxpayers should be used to subsidize a party for one of the wealthiest corporations in the world, said Jane Kim, a San Francisco supervisor. Last week, she introduced legislation to renegotiate the citys agreement to host the National Football League, noting that Santa Clara, the Silicon Valley city 40 miles to the south of here where the game itself will be played, will be largely reimbursed for its costs by the Super Bowl Host Committee.Mayor Edwin M. Lee, however, has said that the Super Bowl will bring a bounty to San Francisco and its businesses.He noted that one million people are expected to visit Super Bowl City, the 10-acre temporary village at the foot of Market Street that shows off the towns best assets: views of the bay, food by top local chefs, and exhibits straight from Silicon Valley featuring virtual reality and drones.The city will pull in far more from hotel and sales taxes than the $5 million it is spending, Mr. Lee said, and profits will fund more services for residents.If were not an economically strong city, were not in a position to help anybody, he said. The last five years, Ive been very proud, have been economically very strong, which makes us very attractive for the Super Bowl and many other events.But securing Super Bowl City, after the terrorist attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino, Calif., has turned out to be a very expensive proposition. The vast police presence at the event, with a command center set up specifically for Super Bowl City, has resulted in huge overtime expenses. Municipal police officers have not been allowed to take time off this week.Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, held a news conference here Wednesday to lay out some of the plans, saying that law enforcement was focused on layered security, seen and unseen.Hostility among rank-and-file San Franciscans, however, is palpable. One Super Bowl statue in Alamo Square, a residential neighborhood, was so relentlessly vandalized that organizers eventually removed it. The statue drew ire because the city had waived the installation fees to place it in a public park, and its defacement drew applause on social media.And National Park Service officials complained that they had spent hours cleaning up hundreds of gallons of debris from a Super Bowl-related fireworks show after it washed up at Aquatic Park, a scenic and historic site on San Francisco Bay that sits right next to Fishermans Wharf.Some residents say city funds would have been better spent on affordable housing or on addressing the homeless encampments that dot the sidewalks. Last year, the mayor kicked up controversy when he said that the homeless would have to leave the streets before the Super Bowl; he has since backed away from those comments. But on Wednesday, advocates for the homeless staged a sizable protest, setting up a tent next to Super Bowl City, only to be surrounded by police officers in riot gear.Jennifer Friedenbach, the executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said that police officers clearing the streets had indeed been telling people to stay away until after the big game  apparently so they will not detract from the festivities, like parties that will draw celebrities like Marshawn Lynch and Jon Bon Jovi.You have a $5 million corporate giveaway to host this party, and thats money that could have been used to house 500 homeless people for a year, Ms. Friedenbach said. It really puts a spotlight on the priorities of this city.To be sure, some locals appreciate the spruce-up. Mary Ann McGregor, 52, who works for the citys retirement plan system, called the recent efforts to clean up the streets a start.I love the attention that this city is getting; I can see the big banner from my window, Ms. McGregor said, referring to one of the many large Super Bowl 50 signs that have become ubiquitous here. The area is being cleaned up. And I love how its bringing in all this money.This conflict between those benefiting from the economic boom here and those who are being priced out is at the center of San Franciscos larger culture war.The so-called Google buses  private commuter buses that whisk tech workers from the city to the corporate campuses to the south  will be used to transport fans to Santa Clara on game day, which tourists may see as a treat. Although this does not seem to have caused an uproar among San Franciscans, it is perhaps symbolically significant, given that the buses have been a lightning rod for anger over the Bay Areas growing wealth disparity.Deanna Leitner, 33, a makeup artist, said the Super Bowl expenditures showed that the city had lost its way. An organizer of the citys annual Gay Pride parade, she said the city would not have waived fees for Pride as it did for the N.F.L.In San Francisco, were supposed to be the bastion of crazy liberals, Ms. Leitner said. Instead of raising wages for teachers so they can afford to live here, why are we spending money on a party for people who work for the N.F.L.?Super Bowl supporters say they are incredulous that anger has extended to this event, which they see as an unadulterated win for the city.San Francisco is a world-class city, said Jim Lazarus, a senior vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, predicting that the city would easily make back the money it put in. But even if it took a loss, he said, there would still be a benefit to hosting big events: This is a worldwide event that will sell San Francisco.Just how much money the Super Bowl will bring is unclear. Sports economists have questioned the benefits, arguing that the tourists who flock to the game often just displace others who would have come instead, especially in a city like San Francisco, where hotels are almost always near capacity. The city lost more than $10 million hosting the Americas Cup yacht race in 2013, a public fiasco still fresh in many minds.Lucy Ho, 45, agreed that residents should receive some benefit from hosting an event like this. But after living here for four decades, she said that life in San Francisco had only improved under Mr. Lee, with improvements to parks, libraries and other services.I get it  rent is so expensive, the buses are eyesores, Ms. Ho said. But the folks who work for the big corporations here, theyre culturally engaged. They pay taxes. And I dont see them going away."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO   In an effort to diversify leadership in the upper ranks of the N.F.L., Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Thursday that the league would now require at least one woman be interviewed for any executive position openings in the league office.The announcement  in front of a group that included his wife, Jane Skinner Goodell; former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; the tennis champion Billie Jean King and others  came at the N.F.L.s first Womens Summit, days before the Super Bowl on Sunday and in the wake of a series of domestic violence cases involving some of its biggest stars that threw the league into crisis last year.Goodells announcement on Thursday is an expansion of the N.F.L.s so-called Rooney Rule, named after the Pittsburgh Steelers chairman, Dan Rooney, which obligates each of its 32 teams to interview at least one minority candidate for any head coach or general manager opening, though this provision covers only openings at the leagues headquarters and jobs on the executive level.The N.F.L. already has several women in key positions, including Dawn Hudson, its chief marketing officer; Cynthia Hogan, a chief lobbyist; Anna Isaacson, its vice president for social responsibility; and Lisa Friel, a former prosecutor who runs investigations into player misconduct.Over all, 30 percent of the 330 employees at league headquarters are women, while 30 out of the 120 executive positions, or 25 percent, are held by women. The league also said it had created a database of potential female candidates to help teams when they look to fill positions.A study last year by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida gave the N.F.L. an A for racial hiring practices but a C-plus for gender hiring practices, which was an improvement from the previous year.The gender grade takes on special significance in this year for the N.F.L. in light of the Ray Rice story, Richard Lapchick, the primary author of the study, said after the report was released.Lapchick said then that there still is a long way to go for the N.F.L. On Thursday, he said he welcomed the leagues announcement. It is a historic day for sport, he said.Hopefully all the teams will adopt this at the team level.The N.F.L. and its teams have been slow to hire women for coaching jobs. Last year, the Arizona Cardinals employed Jen Welter as a linebackers coach for the preseason, and the N.F.L. brought in its first full-time female referee, Sarah Thomas. The Buffalo Bills last month hired Kathryn Smith as a special teams quality control coach.Lapchick said that the N.F.L. is behind the N.B.A., W.N.B.A. and M.L.S. when it comes to hiring women, and is tied with Major League Baseball.In addition to addressing last years domestic violence scandals, the N.F.L. is also aware of the research showing that 40 percent to 45 percent of its fans are women."}
{"text": "We cant undo history, but we can mess with how the Internet sees it. Try Googling The Birth of a Nation, for example. Since its lauded premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last week, this new movie by Nate Parker has burned up the search engines, going head-to-head with that old racist cinematic masterpiece by D. W. Griffith from 1915. Which is exactly the kind of refocusing of historys lens that Mr. Parker intended when he wrote, directed and starred in a slave-rebellion story, snatching the identical title from Griffith.Griffiths epic Birth had instantly anointed him king of the movies, but from its first screenings it also had drawn considerable protest. Days after its premiere in New York over a hundred years ago, The New York Times published a letter to the editor from a New York woman named Annette Wallach Erdmann. It read:The portrayal, unjust as it is to the negro, showing him as a cruel, inhuman, almost demented being, cannot help but create prejudice against a race that has a difficult road to travel at best and needs all possible sympathy and understanding from his white neighbor.Furthermore, she wrote, the film presents a biased point of view that overemphasizes the mistakes of reconstruction days (in regard to carpet-baggers and their influence on negroes, &c.) on the one hand and glorifies the Ku-Klux Klan on the other, (the latter is portrayed as constantly rescuing defenseless maidens from the outrageous hands of the colored man.) Thus it rouses the feelings of resentment and hatred that almost shattered our country a half century ago.The next month, a news item in The Times under the headline Negroes Mob Photo Play gave this account of a protest in Boston:The trouble threatened ever since the photo play The Birth of a Nation began its engagement at the Tremont Theater culminated tonight when 500 negroes, headed by W. Munroe Trotter, who made what was called an insulting address to President Wilson at the White House not long ago, arrived in a body and tried to buy tickets. The management declared that the house was sold out and that the people who were getting tickets at the box office had purchased them in advance. Trotter and his friends, among whom were several white men, assumed such an attitude that Manager Schoeffel called in the police, and a squad of 100, headed by Superintendent Crowley in person, hurried to the theater in automobiles.(Mr. Trotter founded The Boston Guardian, an African-American newspaper, and the White House incident referred to concerned Mr. Trotters protest of President Wilsons segregationist policies.)Despite the dissents, the film was a box-office hit, and the next year The Times reported that Griffith was taking over the Liberty Theater in New York for a year and would there present photoplays of his own making. He was, The Times reported, incomparably the biggest man in the movies; he has seen and utilized far further than any one else the possibilities of the motion picture as a new and distinct artform.It now remains, the article continued, for some one to equal The Birth of a Nation, which, despite its poisonous, stupid and contemptibly malicious race prejudice, was a photoplay of extraordinary power.Griffith himself was the one to equal The Birth of a Nation with his next film, Intolerance, made in 1916 as something of a response to the criticism aimed at Birth, which had greatly irritated him.What Mr. Griffith has attempted to do in his eight or nine reels of film, The Times reported, is to show that intolerance has always been a vice of man.The Times did not employ regular critics to review movies at the time, but it nonetheless weighed in, as it had for Birth:In spite of its utter incoherence, the questionable taste of some of its scenes and the cheap banalities into which it sometimes lapses Intolerance is an interesting and unusual picture. The stupendousness of its panoramas, the grouping and handling of its great masses of players, make it an impressive spectacle.The stupendous panoramas were not quite enough:They are so splendid, The Times said,  that it seems a pity the story was not deleted."}

{"text": "Michigan state officials were aware of an increase in Legionnaires disease cases and a possible tie to Flints troubled water supply at least 10 months before Gov. Rick Snyder informed the public of the situation last month, newly obtained emails show.The emails, obtained through a public records request by Progress Michigan, a liberal advocacy group, indicate that county health officials were concerned last March about a wave of Legionnaires cases, and were at the time raising the possibility of a connection to the citys switch to a new water source, the Flint River.Essentially, the county health officials are putting up the flare and asserting that the uptick in cases is directly attributable to the river as a drinking water source, said an official at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in an email to his state colleagues March 13.Mr. Snyder, a Republican who has faced the harshest criticism of his tenure for his handling of the crisis in Flint, announced Jan. 13 that the state had concerns about whether the water supply might be connected to an increase in cases of the disease, which can be fatal.A spokesman for the governor said Thursday that he had not been briefed by his aides on the issue until January, shortly before he made his public statements on it.He took action promptly and released the information publicly, the spokesman, Dave Murray, said.Concerns about Flints water have largely focused on the presence of lead. Since Flint, a shrinking city of fewer than 100,000, switched its source in April 2014 to save money, the water has had rising, dangerous lead levels as well as unsafe levels of fecal coliform bacteria. After extra chlorine was added to treat that bacteria, levels of a contaminant from extra chlorine also increased.But at the same time, the emails suggest, county health officials were noting another problem: a wave of Legionnaires disease cases.In Genesee County, which includes Flint, state officials say there have been 87 cases of Legionnaires disease since June 2014, and nine associated deaths. But state officials and some experts say they are unsure whether the rise in cases is tied to the citys water. People contract the disease by breathing in mist or vapor that has Legionella bacteria, which is often found in warm water. According to federal estimates, American hospitals treat 8,000 to 18,000 people with the disease each year.We cannot conclude that the increase is related to the water switch in Flint, nor can we rule out a possible association, Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said Thursday. About 35 percent of the people who became sick received City of Flint water in their homes, Ms. Minicuci said, but about 30 percent did not, and had no known exposure to the citys water system in the two weeks before they became ill.Speaking to reporters in Flint on Thursday, Dr. Eden Wells, the chief medical executive for the department, said that the timing of the Legionnaires outbreak correlated fairly well with the timing of Flints water source change.In the emails from early 2015, leaders from the Genesee County Health Department were seeking information  through a formal public records request  from Flint officials about their water given the rise in Legionnaires cases. The increase of the illnesses closely corresponds with the time frame of the switch to Flint River water, Jim Henry, an environmental health supervisor for the Genesee County Health Department, wrote on March 10, calling it a significant and urgent public health issue.Sending that exchange along to other, high-level state officials, Brad Wurfel, who was then the communications director for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, suggested that Mr. Henry was making a leap in his assertion, and described that as beyond irresponsible. He also appeared critical of the county health officials for failing to conduct required work to properly trace a disease to its source. Mr. Wurfel has since resigned.Harvey Hollins, Mr. Snyders director of Urban and Metropolitan Initiatives, was among those who received the email. Mr. Murray, Mr. Snyders spokesman, said that when Mr. Hollins read it in March, he asked the states Department of Environmental Quality to determine whether the concerns were credible, in which case he intended to notify the governor. The issue was not brought to the governors attention until January of this year, Mr. Murray said.Democrats, who have been highly critical of the Snyder administrations handling of the crisis, said the delay in disclosing a possible link to Legionnaires disease was unacceptable.There is a limit to how many times you can play dumb when it comes to events and actions that take place on your watch, said Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party."}
{"text": "Updated, 12:48 p.m. | Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has been talking tough since his rivals for the Republican nomination joined him to campaign in New Hampshire this week, but it does not appear to be helping his poll numbers.In fact, they are sinking.An NBC/WSJ/Marist poll shows Mr. Christies support among likely Republican voters dropped to 4 percent, from 7 percent, in the last week, leaving him in sixth place.Donald J. Trump, who placed second in the Iowa caucuses, remains atop the Republican field at 30 percent, virtually unchanged from a week ago. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has surged to second, his support rising by six percentage points to 17 percent. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the winner in Iowa, received a small bump, rising to 15 percent.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.The figures are especially bad news for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, 10 percent, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, 9 percent, who are banking on strong performances in New Hampshire.Mr. Christie has been dedicating most of his resources to New Hampshire and has been particularly critical of Mr. Rubio in recent days. He has described the Florida senator as the boy in the bubble and mocked him for giving overly rehearsed speeches.Perhaps realizing that Mr. Christies campaign is flailing, Mr. Rubio has offered little response to his attacks.Meanwhile, separate polls released on Friday show Mr. Trumps support holding firm in New Hampshire. A survey from WBUR found that 28 percent of likely Republican voters would back him, with 12 percent supporting Mr. Cruz and 11 percent supporting Mr. Rubio.A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll indicated that Mr. Rubio was gaining momentum after his strong showing in Iowa. That survey still showed Mr. Trump leading at 29 percent, but Mr. Rubio was just 10 points behind him."}
{"text": "OTTAWA  In what appears to be part of its retrenchment from making phones, BlackBerry said on Friday that it has laid off 200 workers at its head office in Ontario and at an office in Florida.John S. Chen, the companys executive chairman and chief executive, is shifting BlackBerry to a company largely based on selling software and services to businesses and governments. He has repeatedly made it clear that the company will continue to produce phones, the product that made BlackBerry a household name, only if that business can at least break even.Most of the layoffs occurred at the companys headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario, and some at an office in Florida. On Thursday, BlackBerry filed a notice with the State of Florida indicating that 75 people at a branch in Sunrise would be let go this month.As BlackBerry continues to execute its turnaround plan, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across our global workforce, the companys statement said. This means finding new ways to enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, while driving toward sustainable profitability across all parts of our business.In a dramatic shift, BlackBerry introduced a phone last year that uses Googles Android operating system rather than its BlackBerry 10 software.Last month, Mr. Chen wrote in a blog post that he is not giving up on BlackBerry 10, which the companys previous management had hoped would restore the brand to its former glory. Were not abandoning the loyal customers who have contributed to our success, Mr. Chen wrote.But his commitment extended only to improvements in the BlackBerry 10 software and left open the future of phones based on that operating system. The only phone plan he revealed was the introduction of a second Android phone. Well share more details about our road map when were ready, Mr. Chen wrote.A gradual shift to Android would eliminate much of BlackBerrys distinctiveness, but it allows the company to overcome the relative shortage of apps made for BlackBerry 10. Also, by shifting the burden of developing the operating system to Google, Mr. Chen will be able to further reduce costs by shedding more employees."}
{"text": "The Green Bay Packers agile, lissome safety, Willie Wood, snatched the wobbly pass thrown by the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, Len Dawson, and zigzagged to the doorstep of the Chiefs end zone, setting up an easy Packers touchdown. Green Bay never looked back in a 25-point rout of Kansas City in the first Super Bowl.Woods interception is one of the most famous plays in Super Bowl history.Fifty football seasons later, Dawson, who played 19 years of pro football, recalls it well.Maybe the No. 1 play I wish I could have back, he said.Wood remembers nothing of the play.He does not even recollect playing in the first Super Bowl, on Jan. 15, 1967, or ever being on an N.F.L. roster.Wood, who spends most of his time in a wheelchair, has been at an assisted living center in his hometown, Washington, for the last nine years, first for physical woes  debilitating neck, hip and knee operations  and later because dementia robbed him of many cognitive functions.Nonetheless, Wood, 79, likes to wear a green Packers cap most days now as he sits in his sunny room listening to jazz and 1950s doo-wop. Wordlessly and impassively, he will point to the logo on the cap as if he knows it has some shadowy meaning in his life. But specifics elude him.When asked about various photographs on the walls next to him  pictures of his wedding or the day in 1989 when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame  Wood stares vacantly.Do you remember going into the Hall of Fame, Willie? Dee Dee Daniels, an assistant living coordinator at the center where Wood lives, asked one morning last month.Wood cast his eyes downward and shook his head side to side: no.You were the best of the best, Daniels said.Wood, who sometimes goes days without speaking, suddenly looked up, his eyes glistening as he raised an eyebrow as if to say, I was?Dawson earned a spot in the Hall of Fame, too, and has spent much of the last five decades as an award-winning national and Kansas City-based television and radio broadcaster. At 80, he is a Midwest sports institution.As fluent as he is, Dawson, who has not seen Wood since 1967, grew quiet when the conversation turned to the troubles of his football peers.Ive got teammates who have some problems like Willie Wood, he said. I think maybe from concussions and things like that. Its, well, its a rough game.He paused.They all have problems, particularly the offensive and defensive linemen, Dawson said. Ive been lucky. The game has been good to me.Linked forever by a celebrated, pivotal play, Dawson and Wood are like parallel stories, a parable for what a half-century of the N.F.L. has wrought, good and bad.On the one hand, the game bestowed on Dawson celebrity and opportunities he fashioned into a prosperous second career. On the other hand, Wood, although he enjoyed a happy postfootball life as a middle-class small-business man, now appears to be permanently paying the consequences of a violent game.That was the steal of the game, Vince Lombardi, the Packers coach, said later of Woods interception against Dawson. Willie Wood at his finest.The Packers were nervous and jumpy to begin the first Super Bowl. That was Lombardis fault  he had made it plain that defeat would be an unfathomable blow to the N.F.L.s pride. The sure-handed Wood exemplified the tension of the first half when he dropped an easy potential interception.Though barely 5 feet 10 inches, William Verneli Wood could easily dunk a basketball, and at a wiry 175 pounds, he excelled in football at Armstrong High, a historic school in northwest Washington whose graduates included Duke Ellington.Raised by a single mother, Wood grew up in a dodgy neighborhood before he left for junior college and then the University of Southern California, where in the mid-1950s he was the first African-American quarterback in the Pacific Coast Conference. He also played safety and was the kicker. Still, when he left U.S.C., Wood went undrafted.Undaunted, he wrote to N.F.L. teams requesting a tryout. Only Lombardi answered, but he shifted Wood to free safety, a position that required the field awareness of a quarterback.There were only a few African-Americans on the Packers, which made assimilating in nearly all-white Green Bay a discomfiting challenge at times.Woods older son, Andre, recalled last week that it was a running joke in the family that whenever he left the house, people in Green Bay would try to guess whose child he must be  since he had to be the offspring of a Packer.Theyd ask: Willie Davis? Willie Wood? Andre said.With an easy smile and a harmonious disposition, Wood was popular with teammates, but he was also known as a fierce, devastating hitter who repeatedly flipped Clevelands powerful, 230-pound Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown with crushing tackles at the knees.Wood never missed a game in 12 Packers seasons, made the Pro Bowl eight times, intercepted 48 passes and inspired his teammates with his tenacity and football acumen.Green Bay guard Jerry Kramer told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2008 that the teams snarling, ferocious middle linebacker Ray Nitschke used to say he was not scared of Lombardi.He said he was scared of Willie, Kramer said. Nitschke said he hated to miss a tackle because Willie would give him this withering look.When Wood retired after the 1971 season as a five-time N.F.L. champion, coaching seemed like a natural next step, and he went to work on the staff of the San Diego Chargers.By 1975, he took a head coaching job with the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League, which was in its second season. He was considered the first African-American head coach in pro footballs modern era, but the W.F.L. folded midway through that season.Wood then ended up with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, first as an assistant and then as the head coach in 1980.The first black coach in the history of the C.F.L., he quickly set about remaking the Argonauts roster, trading for a new quarterback, running back, linemen and defensive backs. But the Argonauts did not jell immediately. When the team was sold in 1981, the new owner looked at Woods 6-20 record and fired him.Wood, who was then in his mid-40s, inquired about N.F.L. jobs as a defensive coordinator. He was told he was too young. For lesser assistant coaching jobs, the message was that he was considered too old.There were not many African-American assistant coaches in the league. It would be another seven years before the Los Angeles Raiders hired Art Shell to integrate the N.F.L. head coach fraternity.Wood told friends he was getting tired of being a football trailblazer. Besides, he had a family to support.In addition to his sons, Wood has a daughter, LaJuane.So Wood instead went to school to study heating, air-conditioning and other construction-related skills. He got his contractors license in Washington and Maryland and opened his own business, Wood Mechanical Systems.The Woods lived in a cheery house on a bluff in northwest Washington, where the only thing missing from the familys homey living room was a bust from the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the mantel. Several of Woods teammates had been enshrined many years earlier.Willie did not talk about it or lobby for it. But his wife, Sheila, did. She had lived in Green Bay in the 1960s, attending all the games, and knew how central her husband was to the teams championships.In 1988, Sheila Wood died unexpectedly of heart failure. The next year, Willie was inducted into the Hall of Fame. The timing was heartbreaking, but at least he felt connected to the game again. He was side-by-side with his contemporaries.The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football, Andre said. He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the N.F.L. coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasnt.There were two busts made of his image in 1989. One is in Canton, Ohio, in the Hall of Fame.The other now rests on a mantel in Willie Woods house, where Willie Jr. and his wife now reside.Chiefs tight end Fred Arbanas was the intended target of the most famous pass in the first Super Bowl. I had beat Willie Wood with an inside head fake, Arbanas said last week. I turned to the outside and knew Lenny would get the ball there. Lenny is the most dependable person in the world.It was nearly a miracle that Arbanas was in the first Super Bowl, or playing football at all.He was left with limited vision in one eye from an attack on a Kansas City street two seasons before, but Dawson helped him retrain his brain to catch passes using his one fully working eye.It started with Lenny throwing passes to me from five feet away, Arbanas said. Day by day, Id keep moving back a little bit. I had to learn certain things, like turning my head sooner to get my good eye facing the pass. But Lenny was there every day. Thats the kind of guy he is.Raised in Alliance, Ohio, about 20 miles from Canton, Dawson was the seventh of 11 children. He was his parents seventh son, and his father was the seventh son of his own parents.Folklore holds that the seventh son of a seventh son will be imbued with special, if undefined, mystical powers. Dawson has never bought it.I think hard work is the only way you get things accomplished, he said.Dawson went to Purdue, where he led the Big Ten Conference in passing for three years. He was also a free safety and kicker. He was a first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers and was later traded to Cleveland, but he started only two games in five seasons. Released in 1962, he signed with the A.F.L.s Dallas Texans and led them to the league championship. The next year, they relocated to Kansas City and became the Chiefs.Known for his accuracy, he led the A.F.L. in completion percentage in three of the next four seasons, with the franchise winning its second league championship in 1966, which earned the Chiefs a berth in the inaugural Super Bowl.Composed under pressure, he picked up his nickname, Lenny the Cool, but it belied a dogged competitiveness.If you miss a block, Chiefs guard Ed Budde said in the mid-1960s, Len will give you a look that has a very clear message. Its a killer look.In the 1966 season, the good-looking, amiable Dawson began an uncommon second job. In what was partly a publicity stunt, he started delivering the sports report on a local network television affiliate. At the end of Chiefs practices, Dawson, in uniform, would interview his teammates on camera.Some people thought it was unusual that I was asking my teammates questions, Dawson said last week. But beforehand I would also give them the answers.He changed in the locker room, dashed to the TV studio for the 6 oclock news and then went home to have dinner with his wife, son and daughter. He headed back to the studio for the 10 oclock sports report. When Kansas City was the upset winner in the fourth Super Bowl and the Chiefs were feted as kings, Dawsons teammates also started getting their own broadcasting gigs  radio shows and TV appearances.Lennys success opened the door for a bunch of guys, Chiefs Coach Hank Stram said.Dawson retired from football in 1975 and stayed on the nightly news, where he was welcomed in homes throughout the handful of Midwestern states where the Chiefs are the home team. People felt he was one of them.Lenny took the TV cameras to high school games and other community gatherings, said Arbanas, who served 42 years as a county legislator and still lives in the area. He wasnt a star sitting in a studio. He lived in a neighborhood with the firemen, police, plumbers and electricians. Thats how he became an institution.Dawson said, I was just having fun.But there were hardship and loss.Dawson had met his wife, Jackie, in high school, and the couple married when Len was at Purdue. In early December 1978, Len found Jackie on the floor of the shower at home. A year earlier, Jackie had had a stroke, but she had been recovering well. She died at 42.In 1977, Dawson received a call from a New York television producer who said HBO was going to start a weekly show with pro football highlights and analysis and wanted Dawson as a co-host.I said to the guy, Whats HBO?  Dawson said.Dawson became a cable TV pioneer, hosting Inside the NFL with the former Miami linebacker Nick Buoniconti for 24 years.Dawson continued as a local sports anchor until 2009. He remains the game-day analyst on the Chiefs radio network.He remarried and has survived prostate cancer and heart bypass surgery.A few years ago, a bridge in the Kansas City area was named after Dawson. At the unveiling ceremony, Dawson had tears in his eyes as he addressed the crowd.I have been called Lenny the Cool, but I am anything but cool today, he said. I come from a small town in Ohio, and I dont even think we have a bridge. If we do, its not named after anyone. I can promise you the first time I drive over this bridge, Im going to bring a photographer to prove to all my friends back home that this really happened.Arbanas turned his head quickly to receive the pass, but it was several feet behind him. The only thing I saw after that was the bottom of Willies cleats running away from me, Arbanas said. Its kind of a recurring nightmare.Willie Wood retired from his contracting job around 2001. There was now a booming memorabilia and card show market to help him supplement his income with his autograph. He also appeared at golf tournaments, which let him pal around with his former teammates, with whom he had stayed in constant contact.But Woods body soon began to break down. There was cervical surgery to reduce inflammation in his neck and spinal cord. In the next two years, his right knee and right hip were replaced. Then there was another operation, to alleviate pressure on lower back nerves.Wood believed the deterioration was most likely related to football. He had played in 176 N.F.L. games and made thousands of tackles since high school. Wood also tended to blame the high-speed collisions he had endured as a kick returner  he returned 209 punts and kickoffs in the N.F.L., and more in college.He started to become too unhealthy to rehab from the surgeries, and as he did recover from one, there would be another one, Willie Wood Jr. said. And he wasnt physically healthy enough to fly anywhere, so there went his appearances.Perhaps more unnerving, there were now bouts of forgetfulness  checks unmailed, appointments missed and conversations forgotten. One day, the Washington police showed up at the familys front door. While driving in the city, Wood had become disoriented.We told no one about that incident; Dad didnt want pity, Willie Jr. said.And he did not want anyone telling him it was all footballs fault.He loved what he did on the football field, Andre said. I never heard him say, I wish I never played. Doctors are unsure if his mental failings are from aging, football or both. Many former players have had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease whose symptoms include dementia and erratic behavior attributed to repeated head blows, but it can be diagnosed only posthumously.In 2007, Wood left his home to enter assisted living. In a newspaper interview shortly after the move, he said the highlight of his day was waking up in the morning. But the worst moment of his day always quickly followed.When I realize Ill be sitting around here the rest of the day, Wood said.My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play, Willie Wood Jr. said.And his response would be, Yes, but I was there. Staff members at Sunrise on Connecticut Avenue, the well-appointed center where Wood now lives, said last month that there were days when he would sing along to the music playing in his room and have lengthy conversations. Many other days, he does not talk at all.For housing expenses, his sons said, he receives about $120,000 annually from the 88 Plan, a fund for former players with dementia or Alzheimers disease. It is jointly run by the N.F.L. and the players union.Its difficult to not be able to talk to him, Willie Wood Jr. said. He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father.Willie Jr. was asked if he had ever considered the divergent paths taken by his father and Len Dawson since they intersected for one famed football moment nearly 50 years ago.Is that a cultural question? Willie Jr. said with a laugh. The white quarterback and the black defensive back?He continued: The folks that knew Dad knew he wasnt going that route, whether culturally it was available to him or not. He wasnt going to be a talking head on TV. Not that theres anything wrong with what Len Dawson did. That just wasnt my dad. He wanted to coach behind the scenes.Dawson, meanwhile, marvels at his postfootball life and almost apologetically wonders how he escaped serious, long-term harm.The fact is that whoever has the ball in football gets hit, and I had the ball on almost every play, he said. I dont know, maybe that seventh son of a seventh son thing is good luck.At Sundays Super Bowl, Dawson, the star of the fourth Super Bowl, will be saluted on the field in a ceremony recognizing all most valuable players of previous Super Bowls.Last month, Willie Wood was asked if he ever watched football on the small television in the corner of his room.Wood stared out the large window over his bed without answering. There was a Packers calendar on the wall just beyond his gaze. From speakers connected to an iPod, a saxophone solo faintly broke the silence.If you had the chance to play football again, would you do it? he was asked.Without waiting even a beat, Wood firmly nodded.You liked it that much?He nodded again.The conversation turned to the coming Super Bowl.Will you watch the Super Bowl on television, Willie?Willie Wood pulled his Packer cap tightly across his brow. He put both hands on the cap, shaping it dutifully.What do you think? he was asked. Its the 50th Super Bowl  will you watch?The man who made the biggest play of the first Super Bowl looked up blankly and shook his head side to side: no."}
{"text": "Credit Suisses turnaround is proving more painful than it could have been.The Swiss banks fourth-quarter results were riddled with the kind of exceptional items and restructuring costs that were par for the course for a European investment bank rethinking its strategy. But even after stripping these out, and ignoring the bits that Credit Suisse is winding down, the bank would have failed to turn a profit.Asia-Pacific was the only one of Credit Suisses newly created divisions that increased its fourth-quarter revenue. Pretax profit would have risen by more than a quarter from last year if adjusted for good-will write-downs. Tidjane Thiam, the banks chief executive, looks on track to hit his target for the segment to deliver 2.1 billion Swiss francs of pretax profit by 2018. But that depends partly on China, and Mr. Thiam is wary over that markets near-term prospects.If thats the good, then double-digit declines in fourth-quarter revenue in private banking in Switzerland and regions other than Asia look downright bad. Net asset declines in these regions will not help Mr. Thiam hit targets that are frankly ambitious.The ugliest aspects of the results concerned Credit Suisses capital position and markets trading performance, however. In trading, fourth-quarter fixed-income revenue fell a staggering 61 percent year-on-year  far worse than for peers.The balance sheet looks parlous, too. Despite a hefty cash call as part of the October strategic overhaul, Credit Suisses common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.4 percent at the end of December was well below the 12 percent-plus average for Europes banks. Listing Credit Suisses Swiss unit is part of the plan, and it will raise capital. But proposing no dividend might have been smart. Thats what Deutsche Bank did.The parallels with Deutsche do not end there. Shares in both Credit Suisse and its rival now trade close to record lows. Mr. Thiam wants to continue cost-cutting and is slashing bonuses, as well as reducing the deferred portion of these to bring down fixed costs. That will help to some extent, and these are early days. But so far, Credit Suisse is not making much out of its overhaul."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked action on a comprehensive energy bill that had drawn broad bipartisan support after lawmakers failed to agree on including a $600 million amendment to address the crisis over lead-tainted water in Flint, Mich.Senators voted twice to end debate on the energy bill, first falling 10 votes short of the 60-vote threshold needed to bring the item to a conclusion, and then falling six votes short. Absent their Flint aid amendment, 38 Democrats, including one of the bills chief authors, Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, voted against moving forward on the first vote, and 39 Democrats voted no on the second vote.Thursdays votes will delay, but not derail, the legislation. Immediately after, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said that its authors would work through the weekend to find a path forward on the energy bill and the Flint aid amendment. Hopefully well be able to salvage this important bipartisan legislation in the next few days, he said.The bill, written by Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, the chairwoman of the Energy Committee, with Ms. Cantwell, the committees ranking Democrat, was the first major energy legislation to come to the Senate floor in nearly a decade. The measure would modernize the nations power grid, expand production of renewable energy, accelerate exports of natural gas and improve the governments response to cybersecurity threats.The senators managed to draft a bill that would substantially reshape energy policy with support from a majority in both parties, and they accomplished this in an election year.But the roiling scandal of lead-tainted water in Flint brought the measure down, at least temporarily.The energy bill reached the Senate floor with bipartisan momentum. But as the crisis in Flint worsened, Democrats saw it as an opportunity to demand federal aid for its victims.I ask my colleagues in the Senate to look very hard at what has happened here and to help us address this issue, said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan. This is a public health emergency on a massive scale. It is unprecedented. I dont know of any other American city where families in the entire city cant drink the water, cant cook with the water, cant bathe with the water.Senate Republicans initially refused to allow a floor vote on the aid package unless it included corresponding spending cuts elsewhere in the  budget to pay for it.Just before Thursdaysvote, Ms. Murkowski asked the Senate for unanimous consent to vote on several amendments related to Flint aid, including Ms. Stabenows amendment, but Ms. Stabenow objected.Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Cantwell and Ms. Stabenow worked for days on compromise language that would satisfy Senate Republican leaders as well as Michiganders, including cutting the amount of aid.Still, Ms. Murkowski expressed hope that a breakthrough could be in sight should the Flint amendment return to the floor in the coming days.We have made headway on federal assistance, headway on programs that could be used, she said."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Help Assads Officers Defect (Op-Ed, Feb. 3): Mohammed Alaa Ghanems assertion that Washington can win leverage in the Geneva peace talks on Syria (now temporarily suspended) is flawed, and his plea that the United States take concrete steps to encourage high-level defections from the regime of Bashar al-Assad is ill conceived.The Syrian president remains keenly aware of the perils of transition from minority rule. He was well tutored by his father, Hafez al-Assad, on the art of self-preservation: Promulgate fear and sectarian conflict among competing tribes.Given the brutality of ever-changing alliances in the region, I do not envision a scenario in which Washington has leverage enough to put pressure on Damascus.Certainly, this plan appears too contrived. Mr. Assad and his regime remain heavily protected. Senior military, intelligence and political positions have been staffed for decades with layers of Alawite patronage (the minority sect that forms the regimes core constituency).Arguably, past defections by Assad officers serve only to concentrate the allegiances of those who remain. Combined with what would be certain brutal retaliation against officers families left behind, I see little chance that offers of asylum and money and legal assistance from the United States would lure senior officers in any number.This is an epic humanitarian tragedy requiring a political solution, not a contrived military one with Washington in the cross hairs.JONATHAN H.

{"text": "In response to a question at Thursday nights debate, Hillary Clinton said she would look into the possibility of releasing transcripts of her paid remarks to banking, corporate and financial services companies like Goldman Sachs.But by Friday morning, it did not appear that much looking was underway.Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clintons pollster, gave little indication at a Wall Street Journal breakfast with reporters that the transcripts would be forthcoming.I dont think voters are interested in the transcripts of her speeches, he said.Whether they are made public is up to the Clinton campaign. Speaking contracts typically give the speaker the right to decide whether any material from a particular speech can be shared beyond the room. Goldman Sachs, for one, declined to make an on-the-record statement.Mrs. Clinton spoke at Goldman events twice: on Oct. 24, 2013, to its hedge fund and private equity clients, and again on Oct 29, at Goldmans tech summit. Both were question-and-answer sessions, according to people who attended, and at the second, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman of Goldman Sachs, was among her questioners. In June of that year she was also paid for an additional event that included Goldman and other groups. She was paid $225,000 for each.Mrs. Clinton mainly offered what one attendee called a tour of the world, covering her observations on China, Iran, Egypt and Russia. This person said Mrs. Clinton also discussed the dysfunction in Washington, how to repair Americas standing in the world after the government shutdown and also talked a bit about the Affordable Care Act, which had had a difficult rollout.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clintons opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, has accused Mrs. Clinton of being in the pocket of Wall Street and big business by noting that she has received major donations from them and was paid more than $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.She has struggled to explain why she took that money, saying at a CNN forum on Wednesday night: Well, I dont know. Thats what they offered.She said she did not regret taking it, though, noting that other former secretaries of states had given paid speeches and adding that no one could influence her politically.A CNN analysis shows that Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, the former president, have earned more than $153 million in speaking fees since 2001, when they left the White House.On Friday, Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clintons press secretary, told MSNBC that if anyone thought they were getting something in return for Mrs. Clintons speaking to their group, theyll probably be asking for their money back when shes president. He added that no one will regulate Wall Street more strictly than her.In a statement later, Mr. Fallon said that Bernie Sanders, like Karl Rove before him, is trying to impugn Hillary Clintons integrity without any basis in fact. He labeled this character assassination by insinuation and said Mr. Sanders should either show his evidence that the money has influenced her or drop the subject.Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}

{"text": "It was disclosed this week that two football greats, quarterbacks Ken Stabler and Earl Morrall, were the latest of dozens of players found to have had a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits.Yet N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, when peppered with questions about player safety on the Friday before Super Bowl 50, gave one of his most earnest endorsements of the safety of the game.Most of his comments echoed previous statements: that the league is changing its rules to reduce risks, has adopted new equipment and technology, and is spending millions of dollars on research.But near the end of a 45-minute question-and-answer session with reporters, Goodell seemed exasperated. When asked whether it was safe for young people to play football, Goodell said that he was glad he was able to play tackle football for nine years before college.If I had a son, Id love to have him play the game of football, Goodell, a father of two daughters, added. Theres risk in life. Theres risk in sitting on the couch.Goodells comments came amid a renewed focus on whether football was too dangerous. By the N.F.L.s own account, the number of diagnosed concussions rose by 31.6 percent this season over last season. Several former players have posthumously been found to have had the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., including Stabler, Morrall and Tyler Sash, a former Giant who died at 27. At least seven high school football players died last year.When asked about these statistics, Goodell often focuses on what the N.F.L. is doing to make the game safer. He bristled at the suggestion that more N.F.L. players were retiring because they were worried that extending their careers could increase their risks of brain damage.I think each individual player makes his own individual decision about how long they play the game, who they play for, under what conditions they play, he said in response to a question about players leaving the game at a young age. These guys love this game, theyre passionate about this game, and if you lose that passion, maybe it is time to move on. That happens in life.He said that the reduction in the number of full-contact practices had not affected the quality of play in games, though the changes were disliked by some players.Players like to play, he said. So limitations on that are not necessarily popular. I get it. But I think the changes that weve made with the players association now five years ago have been very healthy for the game.While Goodell said that player safety was his top priority, he dismissed the possibility of changing the leagues substance abuse policy to allow players to smoke medical marijuana.The league, however, is working with Major League Baseball and antidoping watchdogs to investigate allegations made in an Al Jazeera report that Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning had used human growth hormone.We will work with law enforcement if theyre involved, but we will also continue our own investigations and working proactively with everyone to make sure were taking this seriously, that we find out the conclusions, Goodell said.Goodell suggested that the leagues hard-nosed approach to player discipline led to a 40 percent decline in the number of players arrested in 2015.Goodell said he favored tightening discipline on the field as well. He said he would like to see players ejected from a game if they commit two personal fouls, something akin to soccer, in which players who receive two yellow cards must leave the field.Several of the owners in attendance were circumspect, saying that what constituted a personal foul would have to be clarified.Goodell did clarify one longstanding question: when the N.F.L. would return to Mexico. He said on Friday that the Oakland Raiders and the Houston Texans would play a Monday Night Football game on Nov. 21 in Mexico City, the first game there since 2005.Goodell said he envisioned a fourth game being played in London at some point, up from three per season now. And he said he favored keeping the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers in their home markets."}

{"text": "Schubert already knew he was dying when, during his final three months of life, in 1828, he composed three piano sonatas, the Shepherd on the Rock trio, the String Quintet in C and 14 songs that were later published together under the heading Schwanengesang (Swan Song). Unlike his other song cycles, like Winterreise, there isnt a dramatic or narrative thread to Schwanengesang, though one was provided on Thursday in a thoughtfully conceived program by the baritone Roderick Williams, the pianist Susie Allan and the actress Jenny Agutter.With its dark paneling and imposing portraits of 19th-century gentlemen in military regalia, the Board of Officers room at the Park Avenue Armory was an alluring space to hear these songs of loss and wandering. And given the significance to Schubert of the texts, by Heinrich Heine and Ludwig Rellstab, it seemed natural to intersperse the songs with readings of poetry and prose by 19th- and 20th-century, as well as contemporary, poets.Mr. Williams proved a natural and expressive communicator, conveying the drama and anguish of these miniatures without ever resorting to excessive vocal or theatrical gestures. A handful of balance issues with the pianist were resolved after the first few songs, with Ms. Allans warm touch and elegant playing an ideal foil for Mr. Williamss eloquent delivery. He imbued each song with myriad colorful nuances, his rich, burnished baritone lovely throughout the evening. The contrast when his voice soared on a particular phrase, such as I have lost you in Ihr Bild (Her Portrait), proved particularly compelling when following moments of poignant intimacy.Ms. Agutter read the chosen texts with charismatic flair, seeming an integral part of the proceedings. Frances Cornfords For M. S. Singing Frhlingsglaube in 1945  the opening line of which  reads, Here are the Schubert Lieder. Now begin  was an apt way to start. Evocative writings by the contemporary British poet John Greening were interspersed throughout, including After Stndchen, which followed Schuberts Stndchen; and The World Replies, which followed the turbulent song Der Atlas.Other selections included Lord Byrons For Music, W. H. Audens The Composer and texts by Ivor Gurney, Florence Earle Coates and Goethe. A mention of an Apple store in one poem by Mr. Greening was mildly jarring, but on the whole, songs and readings worked naturally together and with the luxurious surroundings. Emily Dickinsons The Fascinating Chill That Music Leaves was a fitting conclusion."}
{"text": "It has been seven years since he dominated the American political stage, but his approachable Texas drawl remains instantly recognizable. And former President George W. Bushs testimonial for his brother Jebs campaign, in an ad now running in South Carolina, begins with a phrase he made familiar: The first job of the president is to protect America.Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Jeb Bushs campaign, has been deploying well-respected surrogates to make the case for his national-security credentials. First, four military officers praised Mr. Bushs guts. Now, it is the former president, who says Mr. Bushs good heart and strong backbone will unite the country and the world in the fight against terrorism. It is a positive message for the former Florida governor, who has been aggressively attacking his rivals.His famous family is stepping up to aid Mr. Bush, who continues to struggle in the polls: His mother, Barbara, hit the campaign trail this past week in New Hampshire, and the ad featuring the former president drew immediate notice there, though the South Carolina Republican primary is not until Feb. 20.I am my own man, Mr. Bush insisted last year when, trying to play down his lineage, he even left his surname off his logo. Now he is turning to his family for help. And it may be a canny move: Right to Rise says Republicans opinions of George W. Bush remain very positive. And one of Jeb Bushs most memorable debate moments, which was widely shared on social media, came when he defended his older brother, saying he kept America safe. Now, the former president is assuring voters that Mr. Bush would do the same.Changing channels ...Senator Bernie Sanderss campaign apparently did not learn its lesson after he was criticized in Iowa for conveying the impression that The Des Moines Register had endorsed him, when its editorial page had actually come down in favor of Hillary Clinton. In the New Hampshire version of the ad, his campaign seems to suggest that he was endorsed by The Valley News, which has yet to endorse either Democrat.New Day for America, the super PAC supporting Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, found a cheeky way of accusing Mr. Kasichs rivals of mudslinging. In a new ad, actors portraying the likes of Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie, Donald J. Trump, and Senator Marco Rubio are slathered in mud. Mr. Bushs stand-in flings bits of dirt with a conspicuously limp, left-handed wrist snap. Mr. Rubios, however, is not a grown man but a boy, a foot shorter than the other candidates, who frantically sips from a water bottle.The synthesizers and throbbing bass halfway through the most recent Trump campaign commercial might be more at home in an N.F.L. pregame video or a homemade dubstep track. But it gives a unique energy to the ad, in which voters do much of the talking, and sets it apart from Mr. Trumps most recent ad attacking Senator Ted Cruz.$4 MILLION How much Right to Rise has spent on Vane, attacking Mr. Rubio on immigration policy and as a flip-flopper, the most for a negative ad of the cycle so far.$84 MILLION Spent so far by all candidates and super PACs in New Hampshire this cycle."}
{"text": "PHILANTHROPISTS have poured millions of dollars into improving education in the United States  paying for new buildings, buying new computers and even creating new charter schools.Susan Crown, a member of the billionaire Crown family of Chicago, is trying something different. Two years ago, she began working with organizations that seek to foster character traits like grit, empathy and perseverance, which studies show can be determinants of future success.But financing organizations that focus on social and emotional learning programs for disadvantaged children was just part of the effort. Ms. Crown said she also wanted to go deeper into understanding why some organizations succeeded so well.This is my second chapter of foundation life, Ms. Crown said. Its the exact opposite of my first chapter, which was widespread, very regional, not terribly strategic. There were a million moving pieces. This is a very focused, intentional, high-risk program.After examining hundreds of applications, she picked eight organizations to support and study as part of what she called the Susan Crown Exchange.The organizations each received $100,000. In return, she asked them to gather three times over the two-year period of the grant to dissect what they were doing and why it had proved successful. Her goal was to find the secret sauce and reveal it to other organizations trying to do similar work.The organizations selected for the program do not offer typical after-school programs. One brings teenagers together to create, write, produce and act in musicals with themes like sexual abuse, bullying and urban violence. Another teaches inner-city students how to build wooden boats.Yet these programs seemed to be improving the lives of the small number of participants they served. How were they doing it, and could it be replicated?Yamir Jackson-Adens, 18, began going to the Philadelphia Wooden Boat Factory in eighth grade. Living in a poor section in the northeast part of the city, he said he had been bullied in elementary school, and he was still shy. The boat program intrigued him, even though he knew no one who owned a boat.In boat building, you learn stuff, Mr. Jackson-Adens said. Youre free to move. You dont have a whole lot of restrictions. Its more of a trial-and-error kind of thing. You learn from those mistakes. In school, if you fail, youve failed.Brett Hart, executive director of the Philadelphia Wooden Boat Factory, grew up in the same neighborhood and has seen the decline in the education and opportunity there firsthand.We are at the front lines of educational inequity, Mr. Hart said. Our national response has been to double down on items like Common Core. But, he said, skills like the ability to be adaptive, collaborative, resourceful are the tools we need to thrive.He said the funding from the Susan Crown Exchange allowed the organization to bring on a social worker to deepen the work it was doing in helping high school students regulate their emotions and focus on the positive and constructive aspects of their lives. But the meetings with the other organizations and the experts Ms. Crown brought in gave Mr. Hart the perspective to incorporate more academic research into what his organization had been doing intuitively, he said.Similarly, Jennifer Freed, executive director of AHA in Santa Barbara, Calif., was proud of the success the organization had in helping local teenagers, with programs reaching nearly 3,000 people a year. The groups name stands for Attitude, Harmony, Achievement.But the analysis of what AHA was doing helped Ms. Freed envision it as something bigger. The thing I learned the most about is how to track the development of social and emotional skills through a yearlong process, she said. I really learned how to work with other agencies nationwide and imagine AHA as a nationwide program.One criticism of these programs is that they need many well-trained counselors and mentors to work in small groups with students, and that makes them expensive to run and replicate. At AHA, there is a six-to-one student-to-mentor ratio. The Philadelphia Wooden Boat Factory program is limited to 36 students a year.Bringing the ideas behind these programs to more people was one reason Ms. Crown wanted to create what is essentially a how-to guide for other groups.Titled Preparing Youth to Thrive: Promising Practices in Social and Emotional Learning, the guide was produced with the David P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, which has a system to measure the effectiveness of youth programs.We came up with a set of S.E.L. skills that we found could be built up, Ms. Crown said, referring to social and emotional learning.The major skills that needed to be developed, she said, were emotion management, empathy, teamwork, responsibility, initiative and problem solving. If there was one superskill, she said, it was agency, another way of saying drive.For many philanthropists, undertaking an initiative like this, in which success is hard to quantify in the short term and endless amounts of money could be spent over time, could be too daunting. After all, a building is built and computers are bought  or not. (Ms. Crown said she thought the program was costing her about $1 million a year.)Most philanthropy is big idea, but the big idea that no one else is doing is more difficult, said Bill Woodson, head of the North America family office group at Citi Private Bank. Some philanthropists are held back because they may lack the resources. Or it may be a time commitment. Some are just pragmatic, and they want to invest in immediate, tangible results.But, Mr. Woodson added, Id hate philanthropists to be limited in what theyre doing because of measurability requirements.Ms. Crown said assessing success and failure was always on her mind. Success is getting this through a major youth system and to be able to do pre- and post-measurement, she said. Failure would be if this did not resonate. But I dont think thats the case.Yet success can also radiate down to the individual groups. Paul Griffin, founder and president of the Possibility Project, which teaches high school students in New York how to create and perform in a musical based on difficulties in their lives, said he hoped that participating in the Susan Crown Exchange would help other philanthropists see how to support organizations like his.In our field, social and emotional learning has been very vague, he said. As a consequence, of course, for funders and other folks, there wasnt really anything to talk about. People knew S.E.L. was important, but what they didnt know was how do you do it.Ms. Crown said she was pleased with how the first group fared and the field guide turned out but added that the Susan Crown Exchange still had a long way to go: We have the luxury of time to study something and the attitude of a growth mind-set and the capital to actually do something.We knew that were not going to get a perfect calculus equation, she said. There are certain things we can measure and certain things we cant.And this is where these programs can succeed on a smaller scale. Next fall, Mr. Jackson-Adens will be attending Colorado State University to begin studies that he hopes will lead to becoming a veterinarian.Boat got me into thinking outside the box, he said. It helped me adjust to different situations.That is a life skill anyone could use."}

The Standard & Poors 500-stock index lost 35.40 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,880.05, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 146.42 points, or 3.3 percent, to 4,363.14.Stocks were mostly lower throughout day, but losses accelerated near the end of trading. With Fridays losses, the Dow was down 1.6 percent for the week, the S.&P. 500 fell 3.1 percent and Nasdaq lost 5.4 percent.The jobs report showed that employers in the United States added 151,000 jobs last month, a sharp deceleration from recent months.The report included some positive signs. The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent from 5 percent, the lowest level since February 2008. Average wages jumped 2.5 percent over the last year to $25.39 an hour, evidence that the past years of job growth are helping to generate larger pay raises.Were not falling off the cliff, but it clearly shows the U.S. economy is not immune to the global slowdown, said Russ Koesterich, of BlackRock.The jobs report, while less than economists were looking for, still showed that the economy was growing, albeit slowly. It caused the dollar to strengthen against other currencies. The dollar rose to 116.89 yen from 116.71 yen. The euro fell to $1.1164 from $1.1214, inching back from its highest level in more than three months.Prices for United States government bonds were mostly unchanged.

The company issued a forecast for slower growth this year, and shares fell more than 40 percent.Several analysts noted that LinkedIn had a track record of issuing conservative forecasts and later beating them, but this time investors were shaken by the companys financial guidance. The stock closed Friday at $108.38 after its worst slide since LinkedIn went public in 2011.The companys forecast implies the once fast-growing business expects sales to increase in the low 20 percent range this year, falling into the teens in 2017, according to a report by analyst Neil Doshi of Mizuho Securities. He had been expecting 30 percent sales growth for 2016, and mid-20 percent growth for 2017.Clearly, we were wrong, Mr. Doshi said.In the energy markets, United States crude fell 83 cents to $30.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

{"text": "On Jan. 15, 1967, Martin Haupt went to work and tape-recorded Super Bowl I  a decision that he, alone, in the United States might have made.It was a decision that continues to resonate because CBS and NBC did not preserve copies of the game, leaving Haupts as the only known recording of the historic broadcast.But why and where Haupt recorded the game remained a mystery even after an article in The New York Times on Tuesday revealed his role in the taping and his sons dispute with the N.F.L. over the potential sale of the tapes. In the article, Haupts son, Troy, and ex-wife, Beth, said they did not know what he did for a living at the time of the first Super Bowl.One clue  that he made the recording on a commercial, two-inch Quadruplex tape recorder  suggested that he worked at a TV station or production house. Neither was the truth.But the circumstances remain very clear to Violet Haupt, who married Haupt three years after he and Beth divorced.Haupt and Violet met in the 1960s at Forgflo, a company in Sunbury, Pa., that rebuilt commercial tape recorders for RCA. He was an electronics technician, and she worked on the assembly line. We met as friends and co-workers, Violet Haupt said. He became my best buddy after my son was killed and I got divorced. And as time moved on, that friendship turned into soul mates.She said that taping the Super Bowl would have been a routine part of Martin Haupts job. He needed tapes to test whether the refurbished taping machines were working properly.He worked out in what we called the studio, and he taped many things, Violet Haupt said. A lot of Soupy Sales. And a lot of sports, Id imagine. He taped everything possible, good, bad, dirty and in between.She added: Marty was a brain. Very electronically inclined. Very methodical and thorough.For unexplained reasons, Haupt did not record halftime and the third quarter of Super Bowl I, and he stopped the machine numerous times to eliminate most of the commercial breaks.Violet Haupt was unaware which football team her future husband rooted for at the time of Super Bowl I, which the Green Bay Packers won, 35-10, over the Kansas City Chiefs.But after they moved to Chicago, she said, he became a devoted Bears fan.Haupt, who was 26 at the time of Super Bowl I, graduated in 1958 from Shamokin Area High School, about 16 miles east of Sunbury. A description next to his yearbook photograph says, Marty, known to his friends for his happy-go-lucky personality and humorous personality, plans a Navy career. His nickname, at the time, was Bud.Didnt he look like a dork? Violet Haupt said with a laugh, recalling the yearbook picture. She said that his appearance had changed for the better when he grew a Van Dyke beard.But after her husband sustained crushed vertebrae in an accident in the Navy, she said, the couple moved back to Pennsylvania. Martin Haupt died in 1977. His ex-wife, Beth, and his son said he had died of lung cancer, and shortly before his death, he gave Beth the tapes of Super Bowl I, which she kept in the attic of her house in Shamokin for many years.Violet Haupt said she remains faithful to his memory and the joy of their brief marriage.He gave me more  not financial  than my first husband of 20 years, and I miss him today, she said Thursday, 39 years to the day of his death. Id do anything to have him back.Through his lawyer, Troy Haupt declined to comment.And, as of Friday, the lawyer, Steve Harwood, said he had not heard from the N.F.L. to discuss a purchase of the tapes of Super Bowl I."}
{"text": "The Las Vegas Review-Journal said on Friday that it had appointed a new editor, several weeks after the newspaper was bought by the billionaire casino magnate and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson under controversial circumstances.J. Keith Moyer, who has been an editor at The Fresno Bee and The Arkansas Gazette and has been on the journalism faculty of the University of Minnesota, will become both editor in chief and senior vice president for content, the newspaper said.I look forward to working with the talented Review-Journal news staff during a transformational time as we take our well-regarded news organization to higher levels of public service, news delivery and overall journalistic excellence, Mr. Moyer said in a statement.The appointment was the latest change since Mr. Adelson bought the paper, and associated assets, for $140 million in December. The purchase was made through a recently incorporated Delaware company; only the name of an associate was listed on the documents. The Review-Journals reporters later discovered that Mr. Adelson, one of the wealthiest men in America, was behind the purchase.The Review-Journals publisher was also recently replaced.On Friday the newspapers editorial board, now overseen by Mr. Adelson and his family, endorsed Marco Rubio for the coming Nevada Republican caucus.Mr. Adelson is a much-courted Republican kingmaker, but the paper said its editorial board had met with Mr. Rubio two months before Mr. Adelsons purchase was announced.The Adelsons have detached themselves from our endorsement process, the editorial said, and our endorsement of Sen. Rubio does not represent the support of the family."}
{"text": "CAIRO   The furor surrounding the death of an Italian student whose body was discovered Wednesday on an Egyptian roadside grew Friday as Italian investigators flew to Cairo to help find his killers, and it emerged that the young man had secretly written from Egypt for a left-wing Italian newspaper.The newspaper, Il Manifesto, published an article on Friday that the Italian student, Giulio Regeni, 28, had written under a pseudonym weeks before he was found dead that was sharply critical of the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while describing faltering attempts by Egyptian unions to organize.There was no indication that Mr. Regenis writing led to his death, but the article contributed to the broader Italian outrage over Mr. Regenis injuries as news outlets pointed an accusatory finger at the Egyptian security forces. Egyptian officials said on Thursday that Mr. Regeni had been tortured extensively and probably died from a brain hemorrhage.Giulio, Egyptian police under accusation, read the headline of La Stampa, a Turin-based daily newspaper.Hoping to defuse a potentially damaging crisis with a relatively close European ally, Egyptian officials promised cooperation and vowed to find Mr. Regenis killers. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, spoke with Mr. Sisi by telephone and both agreed to cooperate to unravel the mystery, Mr. Sisis office said in a statement.Italian officials had strenuously urged Egypt to allow a joint investigation into the killing, and on Friday evening, a team of Italian and Interpol investigators was scheduled to land in Cairo, officials from both countries said.That was proof, said Egypts ambassador to Rome, Amr Helmy, of the two countries mutual desire to identify the culprits who committed this criminal, shameful act.But before the Italians had landed, Egyptian investigators claimed to have made a breakthrough that, to critics, raised the specter of a cover-up. Having determined that Mr. Regenis killing was a criminal and not a terrorist act, an interior ministry official said, the authorities had arrested and were investigating two suspects in Giza.Mr. Regeni, a doctoral candidate at Cambridge University, arrived in Egypt in September to conduct field research into Egypts labor movement, particularly among street vendors. That is a sensitive subject in a country where disgruntled workers helped oust President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Mr. Regenis academic supervisors said he took care not to get into trouble with his research, although he wrote on the side for Il Manifesto. He used a pseudonym because he worried about the general atmosphere of repression since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, said Giuseppe Acconcia, a journalist at the paper, in an email.Mr. Acconcia said that in recent weeks Mr. Regeni had expressed concern about the harsh government-led crackdown before the anniversary on Jan. 25 of the uprising that ultimately ousted Mr. Mubarak, but did not report specific threats to himself.It turned out that Jan. 25 was the day Mr. Regeni disappeared, shortly after he left his apartment to meet a fellow Italian near Tahrir Square in Cairo. Who took him, and why, are the central questions facing investigators.In recent years, Islamist militants have been responsible for the deaths of many foreigners in Egypt, most recently in the suspected bomb attack that downed a Russian jetliner in October.But in Mr. Regenis case, the strongest suspicions have focused on the security forces because the circumstances of his disappearance match those of many Egyptians who have vanished into secretive detention facilities, run by the security forces, where torture is common. Most appear in court or jail, but some have been found dead.Mr. Regenis body was discovered hours after Mr. Sisi met with an Italian trade delegation in Cairo Wednesday. In the meeting, Italian officials expressed concern for Mr. Regeni, who was then still missing. That evening, the Italian ambassador to Cairo cut short a diplomatic reception when he learned that Mr. Regenis body had been found.The furor over Mr. Regeni received limited coverage on Egypts pro-government television channels, although some lashed out at foreign criticism, which was painted as part of an Islamist plot to destroy Egypts relations with Italy. Others exonerated the police. If they kidnapped him, they would never let him go, said Khairy Ramadan, a leading television host. They would never throw him out like this. This is criminal work.On social media, other Egyptians say the case is a suggestion that even foreigners  who are regularly painted as spies by the news media, but rarely subjected to violence by the security forces  are not immune from the harsh treatment many Egyptians have endured for decades.In a widely circulated Facebook post, activist Mona Seif  whose brother, Alaa Abd El Fattah, is one of the countrys best-known political prisoners  advised foreigners to stay away until security improves.Not while the media is constantly charging people and pushing them to doubt any foreigner in the street as a potential spy seeking to destroy their country, she wrote. Not while this state of fear and doubt is pushing everyone to take matters into his/her own hands."}
{"text": "Ted Cruz kept his hopes alive with a come-from-behind victory in the Iowa caucuses this week. But the way he won raises serious questions about his chances later on.He won Iowa for one reason: He excelled among people who described themselves as very conservative. They voted for him by a big margin; he won 44 percent of them to Donald Trumps 21 percent, according to exit polls. He lost every other ideological category, and often by a lot.The national Republican primary electorate is far more moderate than Iowas, so Mr. Cruz will need to attract a far broader coalition. The history of recent conservative Iowa winners  like Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee  offers plenty of reasons to wonder whether he can count on doing so.In entrance and exit polls from 2008 and 2012, there was no primary state where the G.O.P. electorate was as conservative as it was in Iowa. Only Nevada had a similar ideological composition.It is not a coincidence that Iowa and Nevada stand alone with so many very conservative voters and so few moderates. Theyre both low-turnout caucuses, which tend to attract the most committed Republican and conservative activists. The Iowa electorate might look a lot more like the one in neighboring Wisconsin if it adopted a primary system.As it is, very conservative voters outnumbered the combined total of self-described moderate and liberal voters by a 32-point margin in Iowa in 2012  but by no more than 15 points in any primary state (Louisiana). Even in primary states with well-justified conservative reputations, like Texas or Alabama, very conservative voters outnumbered the total of self-described moderates and liberals only by a four-point margin. In the north, moderate and liberal usually outnumber very conservative voters, and often by a wide margin.Thats why Mr. Cruz has so little traction in New Hampshire. He would be expected to win only about 15 to 17 percent of the vote given the ideological composition of the New Hampshire electorate, supposing he fared about as well among each demographic group as in Iowa. Current polls show Mr. Cruz earning nearly this exact amount.The Cruz campaign, of course, knows it has to broaden his appeal, and it has tried to add evangelical voters to his base of conservatives.At first glance, the Iowa results seem to suggest Mr. Cruz could count on support from evangelicals the rest of the way. He won 33 percent of them, according to the exit polls, which could position him to fare well in the South, where evangelicals represent an even larger share of the primary electorate than they do in Iowa.But Mr. Cruz mainly did well among evangelicals because theyre generally more conservative than nonevangelicals, not because he held an especially strong appeal among them. Thats very different from a candidate like Mr. Huckabee in 2008, who did well among evangelicals regardless of their political ideology.Mr. Cruz lost the somewhat conservative evangelical vote to Marco Rubio, and fared poorly among moderate evangelicals  even if he did fare better than he did among nonevangelicals.Mr. Cruz could get away with this in Iowa, where 49 percent of evangelical voters were very conservative and just 8 percent were moderate, according to exit polls. But it doesnt work as well in the primary states, where evangelical voters are far more likely to identify as moderate, according to past exit polls.Take Alabama, where 80 percent of G.O.P. primary voters were evangelical, according to the exit polls. Even so, very conservative voters represented just 36 percent of the electorate while moderate voters were 33 percent. It is mathematically impossible for the evangelical vote in Alabama to be as conservative, at least in terms of self-identification, as it was in Iowa.Similarly, about 28 percent of Republican-leaning evangelicals are moderate or liberal, according to a large Pew study of political polarization in 2014.Self-identified ideology might be a little misleading. One could imagine, for instance, that evangelicals in Alabama who consider themselves moderate may be more receptive to Mr. Cruz than the evangelical Iowans who call themselves the same thing. Recent elections give cause to doubt that, though: Mitt Romney, for instance, did not fare much worse among evangelicals in the South than in the North. But its certainly a possibility.South Carolina will be a crucial test for Mr. Cruz. As with Alabama, the exit polls suggest that the state is far more moderate than Iowa, despite an even larger number of evangelical voters. If he is going to compete nationally with a coalition of evangelicals and very conservative voters, it will involve a win in South Carolina.So far, it doesnt seem as if Mr. Cruz is breaking through. The most recent NBC/WSJ/Marist poll of South Carolina showed him with just 11 percent of the moderate vote. That could change, but until it does, its hard to take his chances much more seriously than those of Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Santorum, who carried Iowa with demographically narrow coalitions that fell short elsewhere.Compared with those candidates, Mr. Cruz has two big advantages: vastly superior fund-raising and a strong campaign operation. Whether thats enough to broaden his coalition will probably decide his finish in the race."}

PBS NewsHour tries to explain the mathematical formula used to select presidential nominees, and the Republican candidates debate in New Hampshire. And theres always Cops.HOOP DREAMS on Hulu. Writing in The New York Times, Caryn James called this 1994 movie a brilliantly revealing documentary. It follows two Chicago basketball players who aspire to play in the N.B.A. from high school through their first year in college. The filmmakers, Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert, spent four and a half years with the boys and their families, acquiring 250 hours of film, Ms. James wrote. Their fascinating, suspenseful film turns the endless revision of the American dream into high drama. Hoop Dreams is the profound social tale of these two emblematic boys, who are sucked into a system ready to toss them aside, disillusioned and uneducated, the minute they stumble on the basketball court.

When one passes out drunk in his car and is hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning, his friends think he attempted suicide. They take him to a ski resort, where they spill an energy drink on the control panel of a hot tub, and are transported back to 1986. They are torn between reveling in their reclaimed prime and ensuring that nothing significant is altered in the future. Steve Pink, the director, and a trio of dementedly scholarly screenwriters (Josh Heald, Sean Anders and John Morris) load up every scene with more jokes than necessary  visual allusions, verbal flourishes and plain old fall-on-your-face slapstick  but their excess proves to be a canny strategy, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times in 2010. The picture moves so quickly and crazily, swerving and skidding and doubling back for seconds, that minor lapses in wit are immediately overtaken by major (and therefore hilarious) lapses in taste.

{"text": "HAVERHILL, N.H.   In a kitchen where tin pails and rustic kitchen tools hung from the ceiling beams, Glen Putnam pointed to the old box television atop a refrigerator that throughout his life has brought him the latest about Bernie Sanders.I knew about him before from news and stuff like that, the 6 oclock and the 11 oclock news, said Mr. Putnam, 31, the owner of Winsome Farm Organics, a dairy and meat farm that looks out onto the icy Connecticut River and neighboring Vermont. He was the mayor when I was a kid.Mr. Sanders was mayor of Burlington, 75 miles away in another state. But when he began his presidential campaign, he needed no introduction in the idyllic towns just across the New Hampshire border. For decades, a shared media market has brought Mr. Sanderss Democratic socialism, semi-combed hair and Brooklyn accent into towns like Haverhill, Orford and Piermont, where people have had opinions about him for years.I like Bernies character, said Mr. Putnam, who, despite leaning Republican in most things, said his family would probably vote for Mr. Sanders. This is where hes from.Mr. Sanders is leading \nHillary Clinton in New Hampshire polls, often by a large margin. The Clinton campaign has tried to use his neighbor status to diminish the impact of his potential victory here, pointing out that New Hampshire often rewards New Englanders, including when Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator, beat Bill Clinton here in 1992. Mr. Sanders has tried to argue the opposite, that New Hampshire will be a tough fight, but at times seems to be of two states of mind on the issue.Vermont is a sister state to New Hampshire, and many people here in New Hampshire, at least along the border, know my record and I believe they are supporting me because they know me, Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday in Concord, N.H., after driving across the border from his home in Burlington.Perhaps understanding that answer played directly into the Clinton critique, he immediately added that New Hampshire voters still knew Mrs. Clinton better than him.Bottom line is her husband ran for president here twice, she ran and won here in 2008, he said. So you know I think that argument, that the only reason we are doing hopefully well here in New Hampshire is because we are from a neighboring state, is not totally true.A drive along the border does suggest that it is at least a little bit true. Along the mostly frozen Oliverian Brook, Bernie signs hang by bridges and boarding schools and piles of logs. Down Route 10, a gently winding country road that flooded quickly on Wednesday in a hard driving rain, there also were deep pockets of support for Mr. Sanders.At the Corner Scoop, a clapboard grocery store in Piermont, Ginger Rayner, 47, paused from making bulkie sandwiches (a New Hampshire colloquialism for roll) and said she admired Mr. Sanderss genuine sense of connection to people here. He understands people up here, she said.Farther down Route 10, Bernie lawn signs stuck in the snow became dense, especially as the barns gave way to houses in more liberal and wealthy Lyme.David Allen, who lives in Lyme, was proud of the Bernie sign outside his house. He said that Mr. Sanders was a known quantity even to those who disagreed with him. When he was younger and more conservative, he said, the local New Hampshire publications he read would discuss Mr. Sanders and his ideas as more of a scary thing.That sentiment still lingers along the border, and signs for Donald J. Trump are not unusual to see outside red barns. In Orford, Jeff Rose, 53, a Republican and the owner of the Meandering Moose, a graphics business, said, We really are dont tread on me and live free or die up here.Leah Mutz, who lives in Vermont and is the partner of Mr. Allens son, said that a man pulled her aside when he saw her Vermont plates at an Orford gas station to tell her Mr. Sanderss socialism was not welcomed on this side of the border.But in and around Hanover, where Dartmouth College students jogged along the river, Bernie signs frequently adorned mailboxes.Though Mr. Sanders is the favorite to win the states primary, past results suggest he could do especially well in the counties closest to Burlington, which in 2012 went for President Obama by a larger margin than did the rest of the state.Sharon Nordgren, a state representative from Hanover supporting Mrs. Clinton, said the candidate had the support of the political establishment in New Hampshire, where she had been campaigning since last spring. That said, she allowed that there would probably be some extra enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders because he is a neighbor.The enthusiasm at Dartmouth during a recent speech by Mr. Sanders was palpable. Young students cheered every promise the senator made and snapped in approval when he concluded the rally.Afterward, Randy Leavitt, 59, of South Royalton, Vt., who attended the rally in a padded Superman suit holding a sign that said Bernie Is My Superhero, explained that, despite his mission to spread the word about Mr. Sanders, his work in New Hampshire had already been done.The Valley News is the local paper on both sides of the river, he said. As a result, people in this part of New Hampshire were familiar with not only Mr. Sanderss name, but also the policies and politics for which he stood.Its not like, Oh, hes that old guy we all know from Vermont."}
{"text": "Get used to jobs numbers like those newly reported for the United States Friday morning  if were lucky.Its not that the new data blew the lid off expectations or pointed to some radical acceleration in job growth in the opening weeks of 2016. Quite the contrary. The nation added 151,000 jobs in January, which was below analysts expectations and well below the revised 262,000 jobs added in December. That looks an awful lot like reversion to the mean, and it wouldnt be surprising if final revisions show a slower pace of job growth across the two months.But while economists and financial markets have traditionally placed the greatest weight on that payroll number as the key indicator of whether economic growth is speeding up or slowing down, were entering a phase where some other components of the jobs report are more important.Think of it this way: Millions of people lost their jobs during the 2008-2009 recession, and during the last seven years the biggest question has been how quickly they got back to work. But now that job is largely accomplished, and the United States has 4.9 million more jobs than it did at the onset of the recession in December 2007.Mathematically, the rate of job growth will have to slow as we get closer to full employment, simply because the number of people available to be hired can over the long term only grow in line with population growth, which would be something below 100,000 jobs a month.The questions now are more subtle. Here are the questions  and the answers offered by the January data.How close are we to full employment?The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent in January, the first sub-5 percent reading since February 2008. Thats good news, particularly because the details of the survey from which the unemployment rate is derived show that the rate fell for good reasons (more people working) instead of bad ones (people dropping out of the labor force).What exactly constitutes full employment is open for debate, but its important to note that we are now within sight of a jobless rate that matches the low point of the 2002-2007 expansion (4.4 percent, achieved in several months in 2006 and 2007).Are more people joining (or rejoining) the labor force?During the crisis, millions of Americans dropped out of the labor force, and a key question for understanding the United States economic potential is how many can be coaxed back in as the job market improves.The January numbers report good news on that front. After adjusting for the updates to the Labor Departments population estimates, the size of the labor force rose by 284,000 in January, and the ratio of the population that is employed ticked up by a tenth of a percent, as did the labor force participation rate.Its hardly enough to solve the problem of Americas missing work force, but for one month at least the numbers were pointing in the right direction.Are wages finally rising?With full employment within sight, the big question is less how many jobs are being added and more about how much workers are being paid. Here too there was good news in January, with an 0.5 percent rise in average hourly earnings and a small increase in the length of the average workweek.That still leaves wage growth over the last year at 2.5 percent, below its pre-recession levels. The silver lining is that inflation has been so low over the last year, thanks in large part to a drop in energy prices, that the 2.5 percent increase in an average workers pay translates into a meaningful gain in buying power.As we get closer to full employment, it is inevitable that job creation will slow. But so long as these other indicators in these monthly reports keep showing improvement in 2016, it will be a good year for American workers anyway."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  To hear his rivals tell it, Senator Marco Rubio is a robotic candidate, soullessly spitting out canned lines on the stump  constantly scripted and controlled, in the words of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has derided him as the boy in the bubble.But as the presidential campaign enters its most intense phase yet, Mr. Rubios cautious style has quietly but unmistakably evolved, shedding its impersonal rime and offering intimate  and increasingly improvised  glimpses into his childhood, his family and even his finances.When a retired voter here despaired over the sinking value of his home, Mr. Rubio surprised the audience by recalling, in painful detail, his own real estate travails, right down to the cost of having a next-door neighbors home slip into foreclosure. They sold it for $300,000  half what I paid for my house, Mr. Rubio explained. So that reset everyones value for years.When a mother described the toll of raising an autistic child, Mr. Rubio spoke for seven emotional minutes about watching the 2-year-old daughter of a family friend wrestle with the disorder. And when a libertarian asked him about the excesses of the criminal justice system, Mr. Rubio told the story of his own run-in with the police when he was 18.As he reconstructed a loud night of beer drinking in a Miami park, Mr. Rubio stopped himself and smiled. Please dont tell my kids, he asked his audience playfully.From the start, Mr. Rubio, 44, has operated under the assumption that his relative youth and lack of executive experience required him to display the firmest possible command of facts and figures, of ideology and geopolitics.But the newly personal and unguarded approach to campaigning is a recognition that the assets he has worked hardest to develop  mastery of foreign policy, and a bruising critique of the Obama era  are not enough by themselves to capture the hearts of voters. And that the ones he was born with  a compelling family history and an innate charm  will only grow more important as he appeals to broader sections of the electorate.It is also a reminder that Mr. Rubio, for all his dexterity as a public speaker, did not start campaigning for president full time until December. He required time, advisers said, to become comfortable with the daily rhythms of interacting with and fielding questions from hundreds of voters from morning until night.As voting neared in the Iowa caucuses last week, Mr. Rubios speeches about America at the brink and the perfidy of President Obama suddenly contained a disarming detail about his father: Mario Rubio was a Cuban native, and his English was so poor when he arrived in the United States, his son recalled, that he needed a cousin to write down a phonetic message for him to recite to potential employers: I am looking for work.In New Hampshire a few days ago, Mr. Rubio described his older brothers agonizing experience with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Ive seen this firsthand, he said. To this day, he said, his brother is battling the agency to pay for dental problems that began during his service as a Green Beret.How do we really know it happened in the Army? Mr. Rubio said, mimicking government bureaucrats quizzing his brother. He says, Well, its the only time when I ever jumped out of a plane. The crowd erupted into knowing laughter.Mr. Rubio can still slip into seemingly automated trances on the campaign trail. During a visit not long ago to a college campus in Henniker, N.H., he vowed to tailor his remarks to the young people in the audience and began with a promising snippet of biography. I am an adjunct professor on leave, he told the students. But he then proceeded to deliver his standard stump speech almost word for word, taking the students on a tour of global dictators (There is a lunatic in North Korea with a hydrogen bomb, potentially) and cataloging the misdeeds of the Obama era (We betray our allies like Israel).And even some of the anecdotes and one-liners that he seems to share spontaneously are not quite so. Some of his material  like asking, When was the last time that you read about a boatload of American refugees arriving some other place? as a testament to American exceptionalism  dates to 2008 or even earlier.But at his rallies and town hall forums across Iowa and now New Hampshire, he keeps finding ways to open up, with personal vignettes and spontaneous humor.Voters have learned that Mr. Rubios parents drove him, as a child growing up in Las Vegas, through the citys upscale neighborhoods to show him the infinite possibilities of American capitalism  and to gawk at the gaudy home of Liberace. (He had a nice house, Mr. Rubio said.)They know now that one of Mr. Rubios sons lost a 7-year-old friend in a senseless shooting (by a 19-year-old punk thug). And they discovered that Mr. Rubio loves the new Geico commercial featuring a spy whose mother pesters him about squirrels in the backyard as he fights off violent gunmen (I have to get those people on my campaign, he said).In interviews after events here, voters described Mr. Rubios biography as his chief appeal, drawing them in despite lingering questions about his rsum. Carol-Ann Fitzgerald, 58, who describes herself as more Democratic than Republican, said she teared up on Thursday afternoon when Mr. Rubio recalled his fathers trouble finding work when he immigrated from Cuba. It was, she said, the story of her own father, a French-speaking immigrant from Canada.Thats what hit home for me, Mrs. Fitzgerald said.So it was, too, for Tom and Wynne DeMille, who listened to Mr. Rubio in Manchester. Its who all of us are  children of immigrants, she said. Its inspiring, her husband said.He is a good storyteller, Mr. DeMille added. And people love stories.In a campaign whose humor quotient has sometimes rivaled or exceeded its policy rigor, Mr. Rubio has even managed to distinguish himself lately as a nimble comic.While campaigning in Salem, N.H., Mr. Rubio admitted that his four children, who have been growing up in sunny Florida, desperately wanted it to snow on Friday despite the inconvenience it posed to the states full-time residents. (And snow it did.) He pinned blame for the precipitation on his Democratic rivals.Thats not my fault. Thats Hillary Clinton, he cracked to laughs from the crowd. Or maybe it was Bernie. It was one of them.A member of the audience yelled out an alternative explanation.It was Trump!Mr. Rubio smiled and gamely coined a new meteorological slogan for his opponent. Ill make America snow again, he yelled back. Right?"}
{"text": "The City Council voted on Friday to give its members a raise of nearly a third over their current base salaries, the first pay bump for elected officials in New York City since 2006, while enacting a series of reforms  some of which would apply only to future city lawmakers.Each measure  including bills to ban most forms of outside income, require online financial disclosures and end paid allowances for committee work  passed by wide margins. The closest vote came on the bill to raise the Council salary to $148,500 from a base of $112,500, which passed 40 to 7.Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat who is the Council speaker, said that the reforms would increase transparency and fairness and that the limits on outside income  which came in exchange for the Councils awarding itself $10,185 over the recommendation of a city commission on pay increases  are groundbreaking.Councilman Ben Kallos, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored two of the reform bills, said the Council was voting on proposed legislation that had been long sought after. Government watchdog groups agreed, even if some objected to the speed of the vote  two days after their first and only public hearing  and the lack of public input before the laws took final shape.Few of the council members chose to explain their votes on the package of bills related to pay raises and reforms. None struck dissonant notes, as were heard at the Wednesday hearing, complaining that their pay was not going up enough. Many instead used their allotted time on Friday to explain why they were voting for a particular street or public place to be renamed in their districts.Councilman Paul Vallone of Queens did explain his vote against the salary increase. Mr. Vallone, a lawyer and a Democrat, is one of four council members who earn a significant amount of money from outside income. In recent days, he had sought to rally support for a last-minute amendment that would cap, rather than ban, outside income like his, which comes from his legal practice, but chose not to introduce it.Councilman Alan Maisel of Brooklyn said he voted no because he believed the Council should have accepted the recommendation of the Quadrennial Advisory Commission, a panel appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, which last year recommended a salary increase to $138,315. (The vote on Friday also increased the pay for borough presidents, district attorneys, the public advocate and the mayor, who said he would forgo his bump  to $258,750 from $225,000  this term.)But Mr. Maisel, who is a Democrat, said he would still take his salary increase, which is retroactive to Jan. 1. None of those voting against the raise, including all three Republican members of the 51-member chamber, suggested they would not take the extra money. Most left without taking questions.The session was interrupted at one point by the silent protest of nine staff members from the offices of Councilwomen Inez D. Barron of Brooklyn and Rosie Mendez of Manhattan. They stood with matching white shirts with black type reading Raises 4 All. (Staff pay is set by each council member, not by city law.)Among the reforms most championed was the removal of the allowances, known as lulus, that nearly all council members receive for leading committees. While the pay raises are contingent on current members giving up their lulus, the legislation does not take away the power of the Council to issue new allowances, which would require a change to the City Charter, officials said.The speakers office said that despite retaining the power to grant new lulus, none would be awarded."}
{"text": "VATICAN CITY   Pope Francis will travel to Cuba on Feb. 12 for a historic meeting with the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, the first meeting between a pope and the Russian patriarch, the Vatican announced on Friday.For Francis, the meeting is the result of delicate and sustained diplomacy, some of which began decades ago under Pope John Paul II, and it is another milestone in his efforts to reconcile the Roman Catholic Church with Eastern Orthodox churches. The Western and Eastern branches of Christianity split nearly 1,000 years ago.The breakthrough also highlights Franciss ties to Cuba, as President Ral Castro was involved in organizing the meeting, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said at a news conference.The encounter has been under preparation for a long time  it wasnt improvised, Father Lombardi said.He said discussions had been underway for at least two years, and the fact that both leaders planned to be in Latin America created the possibility of a neutral place for a meeting.Francis was already planning to travel to Mexico next Friday for a six-day visit. Now, his plane will stop at Jos Mart International Airport in Havana, where the pope and Patriarch Kirill I, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, are expected to hold a private, two-hour meeting.The two men will then release a joint declaration before Francis continues to Mexico City. Patriarch Kirill was already scheduled to be in Cuba for an official visit.The pace of reconciliation between Russia, the largest country in the world, and the Vatican, the smallest, has been swift. The two agreed to establish formal diplomatic relations only at the end of 2009, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met Francis in June 2015, in what was seen as a break of Russias isolation from the West over the Ukraine crisis..Since the beginning of his papacy in 2013, Francis has worked to reconcile divisions in Christianity that trace to the Great Schism of 1054, which formally divided the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches. Francis already has ties to other Orthodox leaders, especially with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, considered the spiritual leader of the worlds Orthodox Christians.But the Russian Orthodox Church has long resisted overtures from the Vatican. John Paul II tried but failed to arrange a meeting with its leaders, and his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, also did not meet the patriarch.Much of the friction seems to have been the product of a territorial dispute, as Russian Orthodox leaders have accused the Roman Catholic Church of proselytizing in Russia and Ukraine, effectively encroaching on Orthodox turf. Even in announcing the meeting, the Russian Patriarchate said in a statement on its website that differences over church policy in Ukraine remained a bleeding wound.A separate statement, issued jointly by the Moscow Patriarchate and the Holy See, expressed delight over the meeting, calling it an important stage in relations between the two churches. Both parties hoped the event would be seen as a sign of hope for all people, the statement said.The Russian church also cited in its statement the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and Africa as an incentive to try to heal past divisions.It is necessary to put aside internal disagreements and unite efforts for saving Christianity in the regions where it is subjected to the most severe persecution, the statement read.Alberto Melloni, a Vatican historian, also noted that the Cuba meeting has meaningful geopolitical implications, because it comes at a time when the United States and Europe diplomats are working to isolate Russia.The Russian church is closely aligned with the Russian government, Mr. Melloni said, and the meeting with the pope would have required permission from Mr. Putin. Signing off on the meeting allows the Russian president to show the different avenues he can use to avoid isolation, Mr. Melloni said.For Putin, it is a good result, he said. It is very geopolitical.Francis is proving to be an ambitious, diplomatic actor on the world stage. He helped broker the reconciliation between the United States and Cuba, and won the regard of Mr. Castro, the Cuban president. Mr. Castro, in turn, helped arrange plans for the meeting next week.Francis is also moving aggressively to complete another long-held Vatican goal  the restoration of diplomatic ties with China. Francis has spoken of his desire to become the first pope to visit mainland China.This week, Francis used an interview with Asia Times, an English-language online publication in Hong Kong, to convey his greetings for the Lunar New Year and to offer reassurances that a rising China should not be regarded as a threat.For me, China has always been a reference point of greatness, Francis said in the interview. A great country. But more than a country, a great culture, with an inexhaustible wisdom."}

For the second time, a Notre Dame student has won my annual win-a-trip contest, in which I take a student with me on a reporting trip to the developing world. The winner this year is Cassidy McDonald, a junior from Madison, Wis., who is majoring in marketing and minoring in journalism. She has worked for CBS News and Wisconsin State Journal, where one of her leads sparked a subreddit page: I love you, Cassidy McDonald. And that lede? Here goes: Wisconsin cheesemakers found their whey Friday at the American Cheese Society Competition in Providence, Rhode Island, where they did better than gouda they did grate.Okay, Ill try to steer her away from puns on our trip  which I think may be to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, perhaps with East Timor thrown in. I spent quite a bit of time in 1997 to 1998 in Indonesia, during the riots and the overthrow of the government, but Ive barely been back since. Last year I also did a U.S. swing with the winner, Austin Meyer, visiting inner-city areas of Baltimore, and maybe well do that again this year.In 2014, I also chose a Notre Dame student, Nicole Sganga, who traveled with me to the Rohingya areas of Myanmar.This year, we had hundreds of excellent applicants, and special thanks to the Center for Global Development in Washington for helping screen the finalists and pick Cassidy. The first runner-up, in case Cassidy cant make it, is Sethly Davis, a beautiful writer at Johns Hopkins with a strong interest in health issues. Other finalists are Adora Svitak of University of California at Berkeley and also Gulnaz Khan of the Newhouse School at Syracuse University.Its painful to have to say no to some many extraordinary and talented young people. I do encourage you, if you have the chance, to try to take advantage of any opportunities you may have to travel  through your school, or work, or whatever. Maybe its Peace Corps, or perhaps its jumping on a plane and paying for a stay somewhere by teaching English on the side. Or there are volunteer opportunities at Idealist.org and Omprakash.org. In short, if you dont win my trip, try to win your own!"}
{"text": "If you are still on the fence in the Democratic primary, or still persuadable, you should know that Vox interviewed a number of political scientists about the electability of Bernie Sanders, and got responses ranging from warnings about a steep uphill climb to predictions of a McGovern-Nixon style blowout defeat. And all of them dismiss current polls as meaningless.You are, of course, free to disagree. But you need to carefully explain why you disagree  what evidence do you have suggesting that these scholars conclusions, which are based on history and data, not just gut feelings, are wrong?And there are two really unacceptable answers that Im sure will pop up again and again in comments. One is to dismiss all such analyses as the product of corruption  theyre all bought and paid for by Wall Street, or looking for a job in a Clinton administration. No, they arent. The other is to say that youre willing to take the chance, because Clinton would be just as bad as a Republican. Thats what Naderites said about Al Gore; howd that work out?I have some views of my own, of course, but Im not a political scientist, man  I just read political scientists and take their work very seriously. What I do bring to this kind of discussion, I hope, is an awareness of two kinds of sin that can corrupt political discussion.The obvious sin involves actually selling ones views. And that does happen, of course.But what happens even more, in my experience, is an intellectual sin whose effects can be just as bad: self-indulgence. By this I mean believing things, and advocating for policies, because you like the story rather than because you have any good evidence that its true. Ive spent a lot of time over the years going after this sort of thing on the right, where things like the claim that Barney Frank somehow caused the financial crisis so often prevail in the teeth of overwhelming evidence. But it can happen on the left, too  which is why, for example, Im still very cautious about claims that inequality is bad for growth.On electability, by all means consider the evidence and reach your own conclusions. But do consider the evidence  dont decide what you want to believe and then make up justifications. The stakes are too high for that, and history will not forgive you."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Eddie DeBartolo Jr. is nervous. So nervous that he often cant sleep past 2:45 a.m. His mind is racing as he wonders how this Super Bowl weekend will turn out.He is not thinking about the game. No, DeBartolo, known to fans around here as Eddie D, the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, is worried about something bigger than that: the Pro Football Hall of Fame vote, which takes place on Saturday.Eddie D is one of the candidates who could enter the Hall this year. Three times before, the voters have passed on him. Now, so many years after he built one of the N.F.L.s greatest dynasties, will they finally let him in?DeBartolo, 69, wants it so much that it makes him ache. On a recent teleconference, he said, The people that are in the Hall of Fame, those men are immortals. He is actively trying to minimize his expectations.Thats it, Im cooked, its over, he told Carmen Policy, the former 49ers president and chief executive, who remains close to DeBartolo. I just know Im not getting in. This is it for me. Im done.Policy told me Thursday that he and DeBartolo had been talking a lot about DeBartolos Hall chances. DeBartolo is, after all, the only owner who presided over a team that won five Super Bowls. Without Eddie, those five Super Bowl wins wouldnt have happened, Policy said. Hes the one that held the team together. Hes the one who created that culture of winning and the culture of treating players like family. The team really responded to him.DeBartolo ensured that his teams always traveled in style and in comfort, on large, wide-body planes, and each player had his own hotel room, when that mentality of luxury hadnt yet set in leaguewide. He instituted a minority coaches fellowship program, back when that sort of thing did not exist. He acknowledged the players effort by handing out towels at the locker room door.Players dont trust people in suits and can smell a phony in seconds, but they accepted Eddie right away because they knew he was genuine, Policy said.But Policy and his old friend both know that DeBartolos football rsum is not what has kept him out for all these years. The wee problem with DeBartolos candidacy is that, well, he is a felon.Dont be so fast to judge him, at least according to the low bar that football sometimes sets for behavior. DeBartolo didnt physically harm anyone, or gamble on his teams games. He was indicted for failing to report an extortion attempt by the former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards. In trying to secure a riverboat gambling license, DeBartolo had agreed to pay Edwards $400,000, in crisp $100 bills. In Louisiana, some might say that was business as usual back then.DeBartolo avoided prison, but he was fined $1 million and suspended for a year by the N.F.L. That was the beginning of the end for Eddie D. He never did return to his beloved 49ers; to conclude a bitter intrafamily legal battle, he handed the franchise to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and took over the real estate part of the familys business. These days, DeBartolos nephew Jed York runs the team.On Thursday, York posted a photo on Twitter of DeBartolo standing in front of the 49ers five Lombardi Trophies. Great picture, he wrote. Would go well with a Gold Jacket.Some Hall of Fame voters might not support DeBartolos candidacy because of his criminal record. But according to the selection rules, they are not supposed to consider anything but a candidates contributions to the game. Nothing off the field can come into play. So, considering Lawrence Taylor made it to the Hall of Fame even though he had been suspended for drug use, there is no reason DeBartolo should not be in, too.This isnt baseball, which self-importantly considers its Hall of Fame sacred and its members nothing short of noble. That sport goes out of its way to ensure that the people entering it arent dopers like Barry Bonds or gamblers like Pete Rose (though it is happy to include accused racists and noted cheapskates).But remember, DeBartolos sport is football, which already has a dark shadow over it. And Im not just talking about footballs concussion problem or its problem with domestic violence. Im also talking about the fact that the game was founded by gamblers and high rollers, and has been  and continues to be  overseen by owners with connections with gambling. It has a past that is not so noble.Tim Mara, the bookie who founded the Giants, and Art Rooney, who founded the Pittsburgh Steelers, were proud gamblers. Charles Bidwell, whose family now owns the Arizona Cardinals, was a gambler and a racetrack owner.These days, the New England Patriots owner, Robert K. Kraft, and the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, have invested in companies that run Internet fantasy football games, businesses that several states now deem illegal gambling. Does that mean voters will have to think extra hard when deciding if Kraft and Jones should be in the Hall of Fame one day? Maybe. Will they? Probably not.That is why its past time for DeBartolo to slip on one of the Hall of Fames gold jackets, especially now that there is an entirely separate category for contributors to the game. The good news is that his chances are good; the vote on Saturday will be held in the region that he put on the Super Bowl map, and he is the sole contributor candidate this year.He was an important figure who really revolutionized what a franchise could mean in terms of connectivity to a city and a place and made it more relevant on a national scale, said Robert A. Boland, a sports law expert who teaches a professional sports franchises class at Ohio University. He did all the things that made the franchise the paradigm of what a good franchise should be. I think the N.F.L. would have been far richer if he were allowed to remain in the game.Policy, of course, is pushing for DeBartolo to be elected. He deserves it, he said.Many former 49ers also are pushing for their old friend. Joe Montana. Ronnie Lott. Jerry Rice. They want DeBartolo in the Hall alongside them.Its time, Rice said.Hes right."}
{"text": "A hungry sea lion pup wandered off the beach and into a fancy seaside San Diego restaurant Thursday morning, took one of the best seats in the house and peered out the window at the waves as if preparing to order a big plate of sardines.Alas, it was too early to be served. The restaurant, the Marine Room, does not open for dinner until 5:30 p.m.  unless it is offering one of its special high-tide breakfasts.Bernard Guillas, the executive chef at the restaurant, posted photos of the pup, curled up or looking out the window, on his Facebook page Thursday. We found this little guy in The Marine Room restaurant this morning, he wrote. He was a little bit early for his high tide breakfast reservation.The pup was eventually rescued and taken to San Diegos SeaWorld. But it was the latest reported sighting of a stranded sea lion in California, where the mammals are increasingly being found on land in places they were never meant to be, partly because of changing weather conditions driving them ashore.A sea lion wandered into La Jollas Cave Store, a souvenir shop, last month. An employee said she lured it outside with salmon.It was very, very gentle, Jim Allen, the store owner, told a local TV station.Experts are seeing a higher number of reports of stranded sea lions, particularly in San Diego through Santa Barbara Counties, according to data published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Many of the stranded mammals have been emaciated pups.In the first five months of 2015, there were 3,340 young sea lions found stranded, compared with 862 in the same period in 2014 and 1,262 in 2013, the agency said.El Nio, the weather condition that causes temperatures in the Pacific Ocean to become unusually warm, is believed to be a reason behind the increased strandings because of its impact on the food supply web, according to the oceanic group. It can also generate algal blooms and infectious disease outbreaks.The Marine Room, a high-end restaurant belonging to the La Jolla Beach & Tennis Club in the wealthy San Diego enclave of La Jolla, has for 75 years offered diners a view of crashing waves from its dining room built straight into the ocean.About 8 a.m. Thursday, Leslie Tovar, a manager for the Shores Restaurant, another of the clubs restaurants, was on the grounds when she got a call from a custodian at the Marine who was vacuuming up the floor and happened to come across a baby sea lion that matched the interior very well.He said there was a sea lion in the dining room, Ms. Tovar said in a telephone interview Friday. Booth 65. Which happens to be one of the best seats in the house, on the waterfront next to the window.Ms. Tovar went to the room and saw the pup napping. It was not clear how it got into the dining room, leaving the china and cutlery undisrupted in table settings, and nestled into the booth. But the staff suspects it went through a back door that the cleaner had propped open to take in equipment at 6 a.m.Ms. Tovar called SeaWorld, which sent a team with a net and roused it from sleep. The team identified it as female, about 8 months old and weighing about 20 pounds  about half the weight it should be at that age.It was also a little bit shocking to see how small the pup was, said Jody Westberg, one of SeaWorlds animal coordinators, who went to the rescue.A micro-pup. Very small in body length, and very malnourished.On Friday morning, the pup was getting rehydration fluids in a critical care unit in guarded condition. She was spending days at a pool with other pups, and the plan was to get her back to the water, Ms. Westberg said.Thursday night, after the pup left the Marine Room, dinner went on as usual in the restaurant after a thorough cleaning, Mr. Guillas, the chef, said in a telephone interview.At one point, he said, the sea lion pup looked out the window toward the ocean, as if to say, Can I go back now?"}
{"text": "SYDNEY, Australia  Julie Bishop, Australias foreign minister, has sought legal advice on the implications of a United Nations decision on Friday that the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, an Australian, has been unlawfully held by Sweden and Britain for more than five years.Ms. Bishop met with Mr. Assanges lawyers in London on Thursday, before the report was made public. I have now read the report and I am seeking legal advice on its implications for Mr. Assange, as an Australian citizen, she said in a brief statement issued from London. Ms. Bishop said Australia had offered Mr. Assange consular assistance, should he need it.Mr. Assange, 44, sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced an allegation of rape. He believes that if he travels to Sweden he could be extradited to the United States to face charges and possibly a lengthy jail term for publishing thousands of classified government cables that embarrassed both the Australian and the United States governments.Many of those cables came from Chelsea Manning, a United States Army soldier formerly known as Bradley Manning who in 2013 was sentenced to 35 years in prison for passing classified military documents to WikiLeaks.On Thursday, Mr. Assange said via a video link that he had been held in the United Kingdom without charge for five and a half years. He described the United Nations working groups decision as a vindication.This is a serious finding, he said. There is no ability to appeal the decision of the United Nations. The lawfulness of my detention, or otherwise, is now a matter of settled law.The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention criticized a lack of diligence in the Swedish prosecutors office and concluded Mr. Assanges detention should be bought to an end.Mr. Assange said in the video link that he understood what he called a domestic political imperative of both governments to look like they had made the correct decision around his detention, but went on to say that it had been unlawful. He described the United Nations ruling as a significant victory, and said that during confinement he had missed his family.I have had great difficulty seeing my family and seeing my children.Ms. Bishop was in London to address a conference of government officials about aid to Syria. She said Australia would provide an extra $17.6 million for Syria and Iraq to help those affected by continuing violence there."}
{"text": "Creatures resembling dragons dwell deep within the caves of Slovenia. And now with the help of biologists, a new brood is set to hatch at an unusual aquarium, accessible by underground train.This crystal clear egg is one of three recently laid by an olm, a cave amphibian whose long sinuous body, stubby legs and frilly gills led people in the 15th century to believe it was the offspring of dragons.Though it does not breathe fire, the olm has several attributes fitting a creature of mythology. It can live as long as a hundred years and survive without food for 10. It is blind, but hunts using its incredible sense of hearing and smell, and it can detect electric and magnetic fields.Female olms only reproduce once every six years and it takes them until the age of 15 to become sexually mature. The aquarium, located at a tourist site known as Postojna Cave, last expected baby olms in 2013. But none of those eggs hatched and several were eaten by other olms in the tank, explained Sao Weldt, a biologist who works there.It is rare and it is exciting, Mr. Weldt said of this opportunity for a do-over. I was jumping when I saw the first one and the second one. Its something you dont want to miss when working as a biologist in a cave.Mr. Weldt said that this time the cave staff has taken new measures to ensure that this batch of eggs has a better chance of developing. They have emptied the tank of all other creatures but the mother olm and her eggs. The mother is about a week into a 20-day period where she will lay as many as 30 to 60 eggs. Several weeks later, they are expected to hatch.Its the most iconic creature in the cave, said Mr. Weldt. We are hoping that in a couple of months we can state that we have baby dragons."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Warren Moon sits there in the hotel lobby with his black beret and black shirt, recounting, at my request, tales of his days as one of the great and dominant quarterbacks of his time.In his Hall of Fame career, he set so many records, piled up so many yards, that his place in the history of this game is assured. And yet there is that gap, like a rib ripped from his handsome frame.After Moon left college in 1978, a Rose Bowl champion and Pacific-8 player of the year, he headed not to stardom in the N.F.L. but to Edmonton, on the cold western prairies of Canada. His northern-lights exile would stretch six years.Why?He is black. And he wanted to play quarterback. And for most great black athletes in the 1970s and 80s, that was an N.F.L. impossibility.Reading defenses, understanding schemes, being the face of a franchise: There were just a lot of people in pro football who didnt think we could do that, Moon says.Moon is a personable man who punctuates such thoughts with a soft chuckle, where I, a white guy, might be more inclined to curse. The racial strictures and mysteries of the N.F.L. were confounding and long-lasting, and not just reserved for the quarterback position. The center on offense, the middle linebacker on defense: These, too, were largely apartheid positions into the 1980s. Moon leans forward and puts his index fingers to his temples.These were the thinking positions, he says, and offers that chuckle again. We were good for the athletic, reaction positions: run, jump, block.Cam Newton, that marvelously shrewd and gifted Carolina Panthers quarterback, will take snaps Sunday in the Super Bowl, the fourth in a row to feature at least one African-American quarterback, and so we might desire to process tales like Moons as ancient history, an archaeological dig. Except that this dishonorable period stretches into very living memory.Football has done an immaculate job in surpassing baseball as the pastime, cutting across all demographics, noted Charles K. Ross, a history professor at the University of Mississippi and the author of Outside the Lines: African-Americans and the Integration of the National Football League. Business was enmeshed in it: Who was going to be the face of your franchise and your product? A white man.Football was not ready to move into the 21st century.Pro footballs Jim Crow-like era was striking for the depth and persistence of its resistance to change. By the 1970s, pro basketball had great black point guards: Lenny Wilkens, Walt Frazier, Nate Archibald. Baseball had dominant black pitchers like Bob Gibson, Vida Blue and Ferguson Jenkins.Not football, not at its marquee position.I choose to think its more people being captive to stereotype than racism, Moon says.Moon grew up in Los Angeles, a top athlete in a city of great athletes. His father, a laborer, died when Moon was 7, so he worked from an early age. He had time for a single sport: He chose football. He could throw a ball 80 yards and put it on the numbers. He could run a bit, throw a lot. He studied the game, this offense and that one. And at every pass, coaches tried to get him to play a different position  running back, wide receiver.When I was coming out of high school, I was all-city and all-state, and they wanted me to switch to receiver, he says. (His friend James Lofton also was a talented all-city quarterback in Los Angeles. At Stanford University, coaches switched him to wide receiver, and he went on to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.)Moon refused and went to junior college instead, where he dominated. He became an entrepreneur of his own career. He read Jackie Robinsons biography, worked in the film library and sneaked out films, shipping montages to major colleges. The University of Washington came calling. The offense there was unimaginative, but no matter.After his senior season, 1977, Moon led his team to a Rose Bowl victory, throwing a 28-yard touchdown strike and running for two more scores.He was ready for the N.F.L. It was not ready for him. A scout told him to consider trying receiver. He didnt have the speed for that.I refused; I will go to Siberia to play quarterback, but I will not switch positions, he says.The best quarterback in one of the best conferences in college football did not get invited to the N.F.L.s draft combine. He signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League.Nobody had given me a private workout, Moon says. I was bitter. My own country did not want me, but another country did.He dominated Canadian football, helping the Eskimos win five consecutive Grey Cups, and became the first professional quarterback to pass for 5,000 yards in a season by reaching exactly that mark in 1982. (He passed for 5,648 yards the next year.)Moon finally slipped south of the border in 1984 and became the well-paid quarterback of the Houston Oilers. To join a Southern, struggling team at that time  the Oilers went 3-13 in his first year  was not ideal. The fans grew so abusive that Moons young son would appear in tears at his locker after games.By 1987, the Oilers were 9-6 and embarking on the path of regular playoff contention. But even as the teams fortune turned around, Moons path was not easy.There was a game that year, I was playing really well, and these were the positive comments Id get: Warren, man, you were chucking that ball like you chuck a watermelon, he says.I didnt know whether to thank the guy or turn around and punch him.He offers that chuckle again.I inquire about the unseen toll. Moon smiles softly. Hes a television broadcaster, a wealthy man, a monument to hard work. Over so many years, the mask does not fall away quickly.I never wanted anyone to think this stuff bothered me, he says. Everyone in the freaking place is booing you, and you got 10 guys in the huddle who are watching your eyes to see if its bothering you. So you do your best De Niro, even if inside its killing you.I internalized a lot of stuff I had to deal with in therapy later in my career.Even today, change is slow coming. Perhaps all those years of discouraging blacks from playing quarterback has taken a toll. Just six of 32 teams regularly started an African-American quarterback this season.The game is nearly 70 percent black, but African-Americans remain strikingly underrepresented in the coaching ranks.After he finished playing, Moon and other former black quarterbacks formed a Generals Club, to counsel and offer an ear to young black quarterbacks. When he retired, even with those missing Canadian years, he ranked in the top five in passing yards and touchdowns. He played in nine Pro Bowls. But he speaks of his regret that he did not revel in the fun of it more.I felt like I was going out there half the time representing my race as opposed to representing my team and teammates, Moon says. I wonder how much better I might have been if Id had more fun.Cam Newton heard me say that. He said that wasnt going to happen to him.Moon smiles, gets up to shake my hand and says, That makes me happy."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Phillip Yin, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Washington State, has an M.B.A. from Georgetown, a long list of policy ideas and a catchy campaign slogan (Yin It to Win It). But it is four letters on Mr. Yins rsum that have people talking.Mr. Yin, 41, was until last year a news anchor for CCTV America, an affiliate of the Chinese state television broadcaster CCTV. Two weeks into his campaign, some online commenters have suggested that he is a mouthpiece for the Chinese government, while the news media in mainland China has cheered him on.Mr. Yin, the son of immigrants from Hong Kong, said he saw his experience at CCTV America, where he was an anchor based in Washington, D.C., as a strength that would allow him to build ties with leaders in Chinese business and government.You want somebody whos going to understand which buttons to push, Mr. Yin said in a telephone interview on Friday.In online forums and interviews, some commentators have raised questions about Mr. Yins ties to the network. Mr. Yin, a former journalist for Bloomberg and CNBC, helped CCTV expand its global reach in 2012 by joining CCTV America, an English-language channel based in Washington that began broadcasting in 2012.On Twitter, Bill Bishop, a media entrepreneur and prominent American commentator on China, recently wrote, Wonder how Washington voters feel about an ex employee of Chinas ministry of propaganda.In response, Mr. Yin tweeted, Im proud to have shared the importance of free speech with journalists I worked with.CCTV has come under criticism recently for having broadcast a string of confessions by foreigners accused of violating Chinese law. Rights campaigners and scholars in the West have dismissed the broadcasts as part of a propaganda campaign aimed at silencing dissent.On Friday, Mr. Yin, who left CCTV America in December, distanced himself from the videos, saying, Youd have to be a fool to not be a little concerned. Still, he emphasized that he did not know all the facts, and he was reluctant to criticize the crackdown on civil society under President Xi Jinping.Mr. Yin said he had not experienced censorship at CCTV America, though he said that he sometimes had to make compromises, like when the network delayed its coverage of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong in 2014 by a few hours.Mr. Yins campaign has received little coverage in the United States, aside from a front-page article in The Yakima Herald-Republic, a newspaper in Washington State. But state news media in China have faithfully documented his candidacy.Many online commenters here have been supportive.Hope he will actively speak on behalf of ethnic Chinese! one user wrote on Weibo, a Twitter-like service.Its in the interest of tens of millions of Chinese, another wrote."}
{"text": "LONDON  In a sign of severe distress in global steel making, ArcelorMittal said on Friday that it lost nearly $8 billion last year, and that it planned to seek $3 billion in new capital from shareholders to shore up its finances.Shares of the company, the worlds biggest steel maker, fell more than 5 percent on Friday in Amsterdam. The company is among the many big producers of commodities that has been hit by lower demand from the slowing global economy. But ArcelorMittal is taking pains to lay blame on China.ArcelorMittal said its loss  including a $6.7 billion retreat in the fourth quarter last year  was mainly down to falling steel prices that were depressed by a surge of Chinese exports, and to write-offs in the companys large mining business. In the fourth quarter of 2014, ArcelorMittal lost $955 million.Chinas economic slowdown is upsetting the calculus of just about all commodity producers, including steel makers, but with a twist.Rather than importing steel, China has ramped up its own capacity, which now accounts for about half of all global production of raw steel. With the Chinese economy slowing and domestic producers reluctant to cut production, the remedy so far has been to unleash exports that undercut rivals around the world.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Lakshmi N. Mittal, the companys chairman and chief executive, called the results rather sobering and disappointing.In an indication of continuing difficult conditions, Mr. Mittal also forecast that his companys earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a widely cited financial metric, would be in excess of $4.5 billion in 2016, compared with $5.2 billion in 2015.With a steady decline in the companys share price lately, ArcelorMittals stock market value is now about 6.3 billion, or $6.8 billion  less than one-quarter of the nearly 27 billion that Mittal Steel agreed to pay for Arcelor after a bruising takeover battle in 2006.During a call with reporters on Friday, Aditya Mittal, the companys chief financial officer, said that the Chinese makers had been exporting at aggressive levels in 2015; this has caused prices to drop in all of our key markets.Prices of one important type of steel exported by the Chinese, hot-rolled coil, which is used in automobiles and other manufacturing, fell by about 40 percent in 2015.Aditya Mittal, who is Lakshmi Mittals son, said the industry was pursuing trade actions against Chinese exports in both the United States and in Europe, although he said that Europe was less effective in protecting its producers from dumping.Clearly the trade defense instruments that have been developed in the U.S. are better, he said, They insure a fairer, level playing field.In addition, Aditya Mittal painted a picture of relatively weak demand for steel this year, with only the market in the United States showing growth. He said that growth in European demand would be weaker this year than last, and that Brazil, a major market for ArcelorMittal, and China would continue to show declines. He added, however, that there were still pockets of strength for the companys products, including in the automobile industry.The combination of reduced prices and a weakening world economy played havoc with ArcelorMittals annual and quarterly results on Friday. The company said it lost $7.9 billion in 2015, compared with a $1.1 billion loss in 2014. Revenue fell about 20 percent last year to about $64 billion.ArcelorMittal, which is based in Luxembourg, has a global reach, but that did not help much toward the end of last year. The company said it had suffered fourth-quarter operating losses in its steel-making units in each of its major markets, including Europe, North America and Brazil.The company is also being hurt by previous investments it has made in mining. Those ventures are turning sour because of declining prices for iron ore and coal, both tied to falling demand in China. ArcelorMittals mining unit reported a $3.5 billion operating loss for 2015, compared with a $565 million profit a year earlier. The company also wrote off $3.4 billion on mines, primarily in Liberia and the United States, as lower prices resulted in a revision of its commercial forecasts.Aditya Mittal did predict that late 2015 would prove to have been the most difficult period for the industry in terms of the pressure from Chinese exports, noting that steel prices in China had risen recently.He added, however, that ArcelorMittal thought it prudent to raise new capital to offset debt.The company will seek to raise the capital with a rights issue to shareholders. The Mittal family, the largest shareholders, will contribute $1.1 billion; Aditya Mittal said that the familys participation showed its confidence in ArcelorMittals prospects. The company says it has underwriting commitments from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Crdit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.ArcelorMittal also said it would sell its 35 percent stake in Gestamp Automocin, a Spanish maker of car components, for 875 million euros, or about $975 million.The sale and the rights issue were expected to reduce ArcelorMittals debt to less than $12 billion.ArcelorMittal published its earnings a week ahead of schedule to coincide with the announcement of the plan to raise additional capital."}
{"text": "Last week, we published a comprehensive list of the people, places and inanimate objects that Donald Trump has insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy for president.Mr. Trumps range of targets is wide. He has used Twitter to mock 17 current or former presidential candidates; nearly 100 other people; more than 20 media organizations, including The New York Times; several sovereign nations; and a potpourri of things that include a  Neil Young song, a lectern in the Oval Office and a book about the 1896 presidential election, which was terrible (and boring).Despite a 15-hour silence on Twitter after his second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump has lobbed an impressive number of new insults. Weve updated our catalog and expect to do so each week.Our wall of the insulted now includes Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a conservative Republican. Mr. Sasse drew Mr. Trumps attention after delivering a 19-tweet critique of Mr. Trump, questioning his positions on gun rights, health care policy and his sexual affairs. Mr. Trump fired back with a torrent of insults toward Mr. Sasse, wondering, How the hell did he ever get elected? and remarking that the senator looks more like a gym rat than a Senator. Welcome, Senator Sasse!Mr. Trump also slighted voters themselves, a first for him by our count. After failing to win Iowa, Mr. Trump complained: I dont believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign. (He is almost certainly not self-funding his campaign.)Readers may ask  is it fair to call this kvetch an insult? Its certainly open to interpretation. After a lengthy internal debate, our Trump-tweet council determined that it was fair game. From Mr. Trumps perspective, the voters did not give him the credit he felt he deserved; by implication, voters are clueless or self-absorbed. As such, we entered a 1 in the is_insult Google spreadsheet cell and moved on.Still, not every close call ends with a determination that an insult occurred. After coming in second behind Ted Cruz in Iowa, Mr. Trump posted a series of complaints that some direct mail from the Cruz campaign was fraudulent, calling the mail a misdemeanor at minimum. Again  a difficult decision. Its clear Mr. Trump is insulting Mr. Cruz on some level, but, as written, the tweet is difficult to unpack. We determined this statement not to be an insult.But Mr. Cruz was certainly Mr. Trumps largest target. About a third of this weeks insults were directed at Mr. Cruz or his campaign. Mr. Trump asserted that Mr. Cruz was a liar, dishonest, that he illegally stole Iowa, that he could not even get an easy senator like Ben Sasse (see above) to endorse him; that he gave a rambling, overly flamboyant victory speech in Iowa and, of course, that his campaign issued fraudulent mail (which, as explained, was not determined to be an insult). Going into next weeks New Hampshire primary, we expect Mr. Cruz to continue to be a common subject in Mr. Trumps Twitter timeline. (Mr. Cruz has responded to this criticism, saying, We need a commander in chief, not a twitterer in chief.)A grab bag of insults to round out the week: Bernie Sanders (so easy to beat); the mainstream media (unfair, a common charge); Cheri Jacobus, a Republican consultant (a real dummy); and five in a row about Bob Vander Plaats, the president and chief executive of the Family Leader and an influential leader of Iowas Christian right, who endorsed Ted Cruz.See you next Friday."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, N.H.  Hillary Clinton knows exactly what she needs to do to pull off a surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, her advisers say. But it is not clear she has enough time  or enough voters open to hearing her message  to make it happen.With four days to go until the primary, Clinton advisers, guided by a mix of public and private polling in New Hampshire, think that she is running roughly 15 percentage points behind Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Many of these advisers think that the best outcome, realistically, would be holding Mr. Sanders to a single-digit win, which they could then try to attribute to his being from a neighboring state. Of course, that advantage has historically benefited Massachusetts candidates, not Vermonters. But a neighbor is a neighbor, her advisers plan to argue.Still, Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, having pulled off her upset win in New Hampshire in 2008 and his comeback for a second-place finish in 1992, feel in their bones that anything is possible for the Clintons in this state so long as they work hard enough. Here are the six key factors that, in the Clintons view, will determine whether she will win here.Democratic women provided the margin of victory for Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 primary here, and many of those voters made up their minds in the final week of campaigning. Some women said they were influenced by widely broadcast video of Mrs. Clinton choking up on the eve of the primary; others said they were put off by what they saw as Barack Obamas churlishness in describing Mrs. Clinton as likable enough during their New Hampshire debate.But recent surveys show Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders splitting the female vote  a worrisome sign for her if she hopes to counter Mr. Sanderss strong support among young people and independent voters. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton made an unabashed appeal to women at a rally here with four female United States senators, Gov. Maggie Hassan, and Lilly Ledbetter, a leading advocate for equal pay. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan drew huge applause when she applied a slogan of Mr. Sanderss to Mrs. Clinton. When folks talk about a revolution, the revolution is electing the first woman president of the United States, she said. Thats the revolution.If Mrs. Clinton can win a majority of New Hampshire Democratic voters, history indicates she will win no matter how popular Mr. Sanders is with independents. No presidential candidate has ever won the primary without a plurality of his or her own partys voters.With that goal in mind, Mrs. Clinton used the word Democrat seven times during Thursdays debate and repeatedly aligned herself with President Obama and his policies. She was trying to put Bernie on an island, said Dante J. Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, of Mrs. Clintons attempts to portray him as a holier-than-thou progressive who would be unable to work with members of the Democratic Party.But polls this week were mixed about which candidate led with Democrats: They were tied in a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll, while Mr. Sanders had an edge in a WBUR/MassINC poll.To attract more of these voters, Mrs. Clinton has been championing policies like employee profit-sharing and a college aid plan that would allow students to avoid debt. At a campaign rally here on Friday, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York asserted that Mrs. Clinton empathizes with the real struggles of every family in this community, and Governor Hassan repeatedly invoked Mrs. Clintons support for working families.The polls suggest that Mr. Sanders has the edge with likely Democratic primary voters who graduated from college or earn higher incomes. But Clinton advisers believe that her policies  especially on paid family leave, equal pay, and student debt  will appeal to more voters than Mr. Sanderss plans, as long as her campaign has time to present them. Weve got to focus on middle-income, middle-aged, working parents, from about 35 and up, said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clintons chief strategist, at a breakfast here on Friday.Mrs. Clinton won Hillsborough and Rockingham counties in 2008 with about 42 percent of the vote. The counties are on the border with Massachusetts and tend to favor candidates from that state; some political experts think that any hometown advantage for Mr. Sanders is likely to surface in the western and northern counties that share newspaper and television markets with Vermont. According to one recent poll, Mrs. Clinton is running roughly even with Mr. Sanders in Rockingham County, which includes Portsmouth and Exeter, but trailing him in Hillsborough County, which encompasses the vote-rich cities of Nashua and Manchester.Clinton advisers think that Mrs. Clinton has found her political groove by denouncing injustices like shooting massacres across the nation and the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich. She is visiting Flint on Sunday in a campaign trip that is likely to receive heavy media coverage back in New Hampshire. Her passion for the less fortunate is appealing to some in her New Hampshire target audiences, particularly women and parents, according to interviews. And her advisers say she will not be thrown off message by issues that are not her main concern, such as whether she will release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks, corporations and nonprofit groups. I dont think voters are interested in the transcripts of her speeches  theyre interested in, will she take on the powerful forces of Wall Street? Mr. Benenson said.In the final days before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, Mr. Clinton made a strong comeback in the polls after weeks of reports about his extramarital behavior and his Vietnam War draft record. Some advisers believe that if Mr. Clinton had had a few more days, he might have won the primary, instead of finishing eight points behind former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts. In 2008, Mr. Obama had a double-digit lead in New Hampshire after his win in the Iowa caucuses; five days later, Mrs. Clinton came back and beat Mr. Obama here by almost three points. Like her husbands former aides, some advisers to Mrs. Clinton believe that if she had more time to make her case in New Hampshire, the better her odds of closing strong and perhaps winning would be.William Shaheen, a longtime New Hampshire friend and supporter of the Clintons, said no one on the Clinton team was leaving or giving up the state to Mr. Sanders. But is it winnable for her? It could be, he said, but its a long, long shot. We know what we need to do, though."}

{"text": "Carmelo Anthony was hunched over on the end of the Knicks bench wearing a gray jacket and dark tie as he watched the tense final moments against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.Arron Afflalo had hit a 3-pointer with 37.6 seconds left to cut the Knicks deficit to 2, and Anthony rose to his feet when the Knicks forced a Memphis miss and swept to the other end as the clock ticked down.The Knicks elected not to use their final timeout, and Afflalo spun into space and found himself a good look at the basket from midrange with 8.9 seconds left that would have tied the score.But the ball rattled out, and the Knicks tumbled to their eighth loss in nine games, 91-85.The Knicks plucky display without Anthony was encouraging. But the close finish also masked the fecklessness of the offense in his absence. The Knicks shot 37.5 percent from the field. They were led by the veteran point guard Jose Calderon, who uncharacteristically loaded the stat sheet with 18 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists.Without Melo, everyone had to be more aggressive, Calderon said.The sight of Anthony in street clothes was concerning for the Knicks. It was the third time in seven games that he sat out because of soreness in his left knee, the same one that required surgery last year. The Knicks will play next on Sunday afternoon against the Denver Nuggets, and Anthonys condition will be re-evaluated then.Right now, hes just day to day, Coach Derek Fisher said. If it needs to change, well make the change.Anthony, 31, remains the Knicks best player, averaging 21.1 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. The team has struggled whenever he has sat out, losing seven straight games that he has missed.Fisher said Anthony had undergone a magnetic resonance imaging test that showed no structural damage inside the knee.Its just inflammation, Fisher said.Anthony also missed two games last month with a sprained right ankle, and Fisher noted that Anthony had carried a big load since making his return.Fisher said he noticed Anthony was below his optimal physical condition on Thursday night, when he shot 4 for 18 in the Knicks loss to Detroit. Anthony has shot 31.8 percent in the four games he played after sitting out two consecutive contests.The Knicks have two more games before the All-Star break. Anthony was voted into the Eastern Conference lineup for the game on Feb. 14 in Toronto, and Fisher did not speculate on whether Anthony might miss it.Thats not for me or us to juggle if he physically shouldnt play; thats a decision he should make, Fisher said when asked whether the Knicks would try to manage his condition with the All-Star Game in mind. If hes able to play in the games with us, if we feel like its not endangering him long term, thats the decision that includes and involves us. We wont necessarily be able to keep him from playing if he wants to play.It might have felt a bit familiar to anyone who followed the Knicks last season. For weeks, Anthony was in and out of the lineup with an injury that the Knicks also described simply as soreness.Anthony underwent surgery  which the team said included left knee patella tendon debridement and repair  immediately after the All-Star Game. He was subjected to questions then about why he did not have the procedure earlier.The Knicks have maintained that the current soreness has been unrelated to the operation.Lance Thomas also missed the game on Friday after a concussion was diagnosed in the morning. The soonest Thomas can return to play, based on the leagues concussion protocols, will be Tuesday night against the Washington Wizards.The first boos were audible 90 seconds into the game, as the Knicks fell to a 7-0 deficit. The Grizzlies scored 10 before the Knicks notched their first basket.Kristaps Porzingis might have been expected to shoulder the offensive load without Anthony, but he did not get going until the fourth quarter. He finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds and 6 blocks.Maybe at the end, you need a guy like Melo; you give him the ball and he will score, Porzingis said. Maybe thats what were missing.Jeff Green led the Grizzlies with 16 points.Less than a minute into the fourth quarter, Mario Chalmers was ejected from the game for elbowing Sasha Vujacic in the face after the two became entangled on the court. Vujacic appeared to hook Chalmerss arm and say something to him on the floor, but Chalmerss reaction brought his night to an early end.Memphis nevertheless pulled out the victory, extending the Knicks recent malaise.Several minutes after the game ended, Afflalo sat at his locker in full uniform staring into space, icing his knees.I thought it was in, Afflalo said, but it is unfortunate that we were in that situation and had to rely on that shot."}
{"text": "COLMA, Calif.  While the Super Bowl will be played at Levis Stadium, and thousands of news media members who descended on the Bay Area this week were based at the Moscone Center, Levi Strauss lay inside a marble crypt in one of this tiny towns 17 cemeteries, and George Moscone lay under the grass in another.In a broad valley devoted largely to the dead, the history museum in Colma  nicknamed the City of Souls  sells T-shirts that read, Its Great to Be Alive in Colma!It is a town of 1,600 living residents and about 1.5 million dead ones  many of whom, like the 49ers, uprooted and left San Francisco for greener pastures to the south.The road to Sundays Super Bowl stretches about 50 miles, from San Francisco, the epicenter of festivities this week, to Santa Clara, site of the actual game. The corridor, mostly along Highway 101, is a time capsule of the Bay Areas history and its quirks  and a modern-day testament to its traffic problems.It includes San Francisco International Airport and the Googleplex, Googles headquarters in Mountain View. It includes the Cow Palace and Stanford University. And it includes the Hewlett-Packard Garage in Palo Alto and the Burlingame Museum of PEZ Memorabilia.But nowhere along the way may be quirkier, or filled with more history, than Colma, a quiet town of roughly two square miles covered mostly in graves. More necropolis than metropolis, the towns worst traffic jams are caused by funeral processions; Colma residents receive warnings, by automated phone blast, whenever a big procession is expected, whether for San Francisco firefighters or an area Hells Angel.Colma exists mostly because the deceased, like so many present-day workers in San Francisco, could no longer afford to live in the city.San Francisco banned burials in the city in 1900 because the cemeteries were out of room, considered a health hazard and  more than anything  sat on prime real estate. In 1912, San Francisco announced that it would do more than ban burials. It would kick out the dead.In the end, more than 150,000 bodies were moved from San Francisco to Colma, where farmland was turned to graveyards, the fertile soil now mostly covered in green, carpetlike grass. The number of people who die in San Francisco and spend eternity in Colma grows every day.All the cemeteries you go through here, theyre a history of San Francisco and of California, said Richard Rochetta, a Colma Historical Society board member whose father emigrated from Italy and spent 30 years as a caretaker at Olivet Memorial Park.In Colma, there are governors, mayors and senators. There are tycoons, archbishops and Civil War generals. There are architects, activists and artists. There are men once known as the Rice King, the Cattle King, the Fish King, the Beef King and the Potato King. There are Alcatraz inmates, city socialites and Phineas Gage, who was cutting a railroad bed in 1848 and somehow survived when explosive powder detonated and a 43-inch tamping iron was sent through his cheek, brain and skull before landing dozens of feet away. (His body is in Colma; his head and tamping iron are at Harvard Medical School.)Levi Strauss is at Home of Peace, next to Hills of Eternity, where Wyatt Earp can be found. Joe DiMaggio is at Holy Cross, where his dark marble headstone this week propped up a couple of bats and two baseballs left there by fans.A few feet behind DiMaggio is a crypt for Michael Henry de Young, founder of The San Francisco Chronicle, whose family name adorns the citys major art museum.Near the entrance to Holy Cross is a slate-black rectangular stone for Edmund G. Brown, the former California governor and father of the current one. Near the back is a small pink stone nestled in the grass for Moscone (We love you Dad), the San Francisco mayor assassinated along with the gay-rights activist Harvey Milk in 1978.Next door, at Cypress Lawn, is a Greek-inspired marble tomb surrounded by 16 Ionic columns. It has no name on it but houses William Randolph Hearst, his parents (who built it) and other family members.Not far away, past the angel of grief embracing the grave for Jennie Roosevelt Pool (a cousin of Theodore Roosevelt), is the baseball player and manager Lefty ODoul. His marker lists his batting average and says, He was here at a good time and had a good time while he was here.Steve Silver, creator of the long-running San Francisco musical revue Beach Blanket Babylon  the media center at the Moscone Center has a large display of it this week  lies nearby.History, though, rests largely with thousands of the earliest San Francisco residents, buried in unmarked graves. When San Francisco flourished following the arrival of the 49ers (the gold-seekers of the 1800s, not the football team), the city had four major cemeteries near what is now the University of San Francisco.Those four cemeteries  Calvary, Laurel Hill, Masonic and Odd Fellows  were a mess by the late 1800s, untended and scavenged. They were also full, and the city was still growing. The land was too valuable for the dead.(There are two cemeteries remaining in San Francisco: the Golden Gate National Cemetery for veterans at the Presidio and a small one at Mission Dolores.)The cemeteries had all fallen into disrepair, essentially because they relied on new plots to make money for their upkeep, said Maureen OConnor, president of the Colma Historical Association.San Francisco cemeteries bought land south of the city and established new ones. From about 1920 to 1941, the big four cemeteries moved roughly 150,000 bodies. Graves and markers of the deceased whose families paid to have them moved (generally $10) were replanted 15 miles south, sometimes after a solemn procession.But most of the dead were dug up, moved and reburied in mass graves. Many grave markers, with etched names and dates, never left San Francisco. They were used to build drain gutters at Buena Vista Park and to bolster the breakwater near St. Francis Yacht Club. Some are occasionally spotted at low tide in the sand along Ocean Beach.A monument at Holy Cross in Colma today reads: Interred here are the remains of 39,307 Catholics moved from Mt. Calvary Cemetery in 1940 and 1941 by order of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Rest in Gods Loving Care.A similar mass grave marked by an obelisk at Cypress Lawn, with the remains of an estimated 35,000 former San Franciscans, is said to include the headless body of Gage; Senator David Broderick, killed in an 1859 duel with Chief Justice David S. Terry of the California Supreme Court; and Andrew Smith Hallidie, considered the inventor of the San Francisco cable-car system.By 1924, Colma was incorporated (first as Lawndale, reverting to Colma in 1941), and it has never had more living residents than dead ones.Always a place friendly to florists and monument makers, and a bar called Molloys that dates to 1883, Colma began attracting car dealerships and strip malls on its western edge, near Interstate 280, in the 1970s. The train line that once carried dead bodies to Colma is now the BART line that carries living residents to neighboring cities on the Peninsula.Supported by a commercial sales tax (but not from the cemeteries, which are nonprofit), Colma is a neat and tidy town, with three small neighborhoods and 17 sprawling, manicured cemeteries, including one for pets. Residents know that it is the dead that set Colma apart from its suburban neighbors.We are the city of souls, but we are really protecting the cemeteries, said Helen Fisicaro, Colmas vice mayor. There is an emotional attachment to them.There are no famous football players known to be interred in Colma. But there is Burl Toler, the N.F.L.s first black on-field official, who worked Super Bowl XIV. And despite famous residents such as Strauss and Moscone, Colma really has little to do with Sundays Super Bowl.But it is on the road to it, for those able to pass through without stopping forever."}
{"text": "BEDFORD, N.H.  The man who stood at Jeb Bushs rally here Saturday morning had not a question but a comment.A metaphor, really.About a boxing match.That took place more than three decades ago.The voter, no fan of Donald J. Trump, said that with yet another Republican debate looming Saturday night, he couldnt help but think of the famous boxing match in 1980 in which Mike Weaver  faced off against John Tate for the W.B.A. heavyweight championship.Mr. Tate had dominated the first ten rounds, leaving Mr. Weaver battered, bruised and against the ropes. But then, in the 15th round, Mr. Weaver reared back, dropping his opponent to the mat out with a single left hook  a knockout blow for the win.Youre Mike Weaver, the man told Mr. Bush, imploring him: Throw that punch tonight."}
{"text": "EDINBURGH  The most intriguing rookie in the Six Nations rugby tournament is also its oldest: Frances new coach, Guy Novs. He takes charge of his first international match Saturday, the day after he turns 62, when France entertains Italy in the opening round.Novs brings unmatched credentials from club rugby  four European and 10 national championships with Stade Toulousain  but he faces an immense challenge.My aim is that we should again become one of the great nations of rugby, he said at the tournaments media launch in London late last month. That status was until recently taken for granted, but Novss inheritance from his predecessor, Philippe Saint-Andr, includes four consecutive lower-half finishes in Six Nations  Frances worst run since the 1920s  and a 62-13 ejection by New Zealand in the World Cup last autumn.His club record makes his appointment, to many, long overdue. Yet it seemed it might never happen after he was overlooked for the post in 2007, then turned it down in 2011, saying it would be too difficult to leave Toulouse.France does these things differently. The announcement of Novss appointment before the World Cup sent Saint-Andr into the tournament a lame duck, but any other major rugby country would likely have fired him long before. Once France has made its choice, it usually sticks to it through the four-year World Cup cycle.So Novs can think ahead. He has named four players without international experience to play against Italy, including the Clermont lock Paul Jedresiak, who will be 23 years old on match day. Also playing will be the winger Virimi Vakatawa, who has Fijian origins and was plucked from Frances rugby sevens squad. There are three more newcomers on the bench.Whatever the job, there is always a first day, some point when you have to start, Novs said when announcing the lineup Thursday. This is the start of something new. I dont want to wait three years to make experiments.The rookies will be given time. I want to play the same players, and as few as possible over the next four years, he said. We must understand if they are not at their best at the beginning. Young players need to gain experience.With the Australian Eddie Jones taking over England, the Frenchman Jacques Brunel continuing with Italy and with New Zealanders in charge of the three Celtic nations, Novs is the only man coaching his own country.It doesnt matter where the coach comes from, so long as he is good at his job, Novs said. Rugby is now both European and global.He will, though, be expected to restore a French rugby idiom that has lost much of its once-unpredictable brilliance without any gain in efficiency. While he has cast doubt on the idea of a traditional style, he has called for a rugby of movement and cited as examples the Argentine team, whose World Cup performances had a fluidity that recalled the best French teams.He will have the good will of the French nation and of some of his Six Nations counterparts. He is universally respected, said Joe Schmidt, the coach of the reigning champion, Ireland. He will bring a voice of calm and of reason.Other French coaches may be another matter. Bernard Laporte, one of Novss predecessors, this past week recalled him as singularly unhelpful to the national cause when in charge of Toulouse. And there was a marked lack of eye contact when Novs and Brunel crossed paths at the tournament launch.Novs faces the challenges of age and of adjusting to the distinctive routines of international rugby. As he has said: A club is every day, from morning to night. This is very different to the rhythm of the club.Young players like the inside center Jonathan Danty, who admitted to feeling intimidated before meeting Novs, may not get enough time with him to appreciate the qualities that inspired his players at Toulouse.He can read men like a book. Nobody can match his ability to read character and find the best of it, the former Toulouse and France captain Fabien Pelous has said. I spent more than 10 years at Toulouse, and every time I thought I knew what he was going to say, he surprised me.Veterans can triumph in international rugby. Graham Henry was 65 when he coached New Zealand to the 2011 World Cup. A better precedent may be found in another sport and in Spain, the country from which Novss grandfather escaped as a civil war refugee in the 1930s.In 2004, Spains soccer authorities turned to 65-year-old Luis Aragons, a veteran with no international experience. At Euro 2008, he ended decades of Spanish underachievement and laid the foundation for greater triumphs that followed.Novss previous record is much stronger than Aragonss, while France has five years rather than five decades of underachievement to turn around. Few veterans ever looked a sounder bet."}
{"text": "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal, T. S. Eliot said, meaning that the best poets seek to improve on lasting ideas. It would seem that the Democratic presidential primarys mature poet is Hillary Clinton, who has been adopting the progressive words, and style, of her rival Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senators longstanding call for revolution against a system rigged against the poor and middle class resonates with young Democrats who jam convention halls to hear his booming, Brooklyn-accented voice. Some Democrats say its great that Mr. Sanders is nudging Mrs. Clinton to the left. Others say shes merely parroting the races true progressive.In April, leading Mr. Sanders by more than 50 points nationally, Mrs. Clinton traversed Iowa in her Scooby bus, speaking to handfuls of people at highly orchestrated round tables, favoring everybody-wins subjects like help for small business. In July, she opened up on Republicans, without mentioning her Democratic opponents. In September, Mrs. Clinton told a gathering in Ohio that she was kind of moderate and center. A month later, after poll numbers showed that Mr. Sanders was gaining on her in Iowa, she drew criticism for newly portraying herself as a progressive.Now locked in a tighter race, Mrs. Clinton is holding big rallies too, and she increasingly channels the Bern. As both Democratic candidates made closing arguments at rallies in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, before the caucuses, it was remarkable how Mrs. Clintons talking points, style, even hand gestures resembled Mr. Sanderss. In a fiery speech in a high school gym, she used clipped-cadence flourishes like, Heres what I want ya to know, guys, to raise topics her rival holds dear: income inequality, poverty, the Koch brothers, taxing millionaires. Were going where the money is, the money is where the wealthy are, were gonna change the tax code and make them pay for all of the benefits theyve got here in America! she shouted.This is the sincerest form of flattery. Heres what Mr. Sanders said when he was inaugurated as the mayor of Burlington, Vt., 35 years ago: In America today, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the millions of families in the middle are gradually sliding out of the middle class and into poverty. Hes been saying that ever since. Trying to beat Bernie Sanders at his own game carries risks for Mrs. Clinton. Democrats frequently fault her on trustworthiness, accusing her of changing her positions to suit the political moment.Responding to Mr. Sanderss call for a $15 per hour minimum wage, Mrs. Clinton, who favors raising the federal minimum to $12, now says she supports state and local efforts for higher minimums. Her call for a fair share surcharge on people making more than $5 million a year is a response to Mr. Sanderss signature call for the rich to take on a greater role in caring for the poor. Both candidates now take their audiences on a Caribbean tour of overseas tax havens and pledge to close tax loopholes for wealthy individuals and corporations, a longtime stance of Mr. Sanderss.Mr. Sanders now promises to increase government funding to Planned Parenthood, an organization Mrs. Clinton has championed for years. He also puts equal pay for women front and center in his speeches, another issue Mrs. Clinton, endorsed by many womens groups, has owned in the past.Mrs. Clintons Sanders impression is least convincing when she rails against big finance. She has a legitimate plan to rein in what she calls the shadow banking economy  hedge funds, big insurers and the like. But her Bernie-esque tough talk seems less convincing when she continues to court Wall Street contributions.At a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday night, and in Thursday nights debate, the two candidates bickered over who is a progressive. At the town hall, Mrs. Clinton said she found it amusing how Senator Sanders has set himself up as the gatekeeper of who gets to be a progressive. But Mr. Sanders said, I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15 million from Wall Street.The merging of the philosophies pursued by these two very different politicians is a fascinating twist in the race. After an entire political career as a voice in the wilderness, Mr. Sanderss lifelong message is resonating. The challenge for Mrs. Clinton is to listen and adapt to what these voters are demanding, not just to imitate what Mr. Sanders says."}
{"text": "NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar  The democracy movement of the Nobel Peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is negotiating with Myanmars military over the composition of the next government, including a possible deal that would allow her to be president, two senior members of her party said on Friday.The officials said the party had offered senior government posts to the military as part of a deal in which the military would allow Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to be president.The precise details of the negotiations remain murky, and the party members spoke on the condition of anonymity because, in the words of one, now is a very sensitive time.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis party, the National League for Democracy, won the election in November by a landslide, ending five decades of military rule here. But the countrys Constitution, which was written by the military, bars her from the presidency because her two children have foreign citizenship, as did her husband, who died in 1999.The Constitution can only be amended with the consent of the military.Relations between Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner, and the military are seen as crucial to the success of her government. In addition to the lock on the Constitution, the military retains control of a quarter of the seats in Parliament and several key ministries.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has long desired the presidency and has campaigned to amend the Constitution to allow it.During the election campaign she said she planned to have her party elect a proxy who would answer to her, putting her above the president.But now members of her party say they are hopeful that she can assume the post herself.The party has a solid majority in the new Parliament, which convened for the first time this week. The negotiations have been largely held in the shadows of the weeks parliamentary session.The negotiations have been through brokers, said U Zaw Htay, a member of the governments transition team who served as a director in the office of departing President Thein Sein.Among those believed to be brokering the negotiations is Thura Shwe Mann, the former speaker of the lower house of Parliament who, despite having been a top official in the repressive dictatorship, has since become an ally of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis.One senior member of the National League for Democracy said the party was considering offering the post of chief minister, the top regional executive job, in three important places: the city of Yangon, Rakhine State and Shan State. Yangon is the countrys commercial capital, while Rakhine and Shan are restive states in which the military has a large presence.Members of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis party have been outwardly optimistic that she will be able to become president.U Tin Oo, a former general and co-founder of the National League for Democracy, said this week that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi would definitely become president.But the military-run Myawaddy newspaper ran a commentary on Monday, the day that the new Parliament opened, saying that amending the Constitution would be against the national interest."}
{"text": "A high-voiced heartthrob and songwriter leads his band to Top 10 albums and arenas, goes solo and headlines his own stadium shows. Then he rejoins his former bandmates for a final set of performances together. Its the story of Michael Jackson and the Jacksons. Its also the story of Romeo Santos and Aventura, a band formed in the Bronx in the 1990s that brought bachata, music from the Dominican Republic, to listeners worldwide.The group disbanded amicably in 2011; Mr. Santos regrouped Aventura during one of his consecutive sold-out concerts at Yankee Stadium in 2014. Romeo Santos and Henry Santos, Aventuras singers, are cousins; Lenny Santos and Max Santos, the guitarist and bassist, are brothers but not related to the singers. Instead of touring worldwide, Aventura is playing 20 farewell shows this month at the 3,300-seat United Palace Theater in Washington Heights, the Dominican-American neighborhood that was an early Aventura stronghold. The run started on Thursday night and continues through Feb. 29.Aventuras music drew on a longtime tradition. Bachata is a rural Dominican style centered on staccato guitar syncopations and tales of woe. Using boy-band charm as well as crossover touches in the music, Aventura and Mr. Santos, on his solo albums in 2012 and 2014, became the best-selling acts in 21st-century Latin pop.Aventura didnt change bachata beyond recognition, but it added considerable New York City outreach. Its arrangements punched up the bass  sometimes with funky thumb-popping  and gave Romeo Santos space to use the vocal quavers and turns of current R&B.Now and then, and in a segment of Thursdays concert, Aventura switched from the lilt of bachata to keyboard-centered pop-R&B ballads; it also dipped into Puerto Rican reggaetn and the speedy merengue that dominated Dominican music in the 1990s. Its an American band, rooted in immigrant music yet approachable from many directions. When Romeo Santos bantered with the United Palace audience, he switched frequently between English and Spanish.Playing the farewell shows in a theater  not an arena or stadium  honors the intimacy of Aventuras music, with Romeo Santoss sweetly imploring voice at its center. The concerts flashiest moments had Lenny and Max Santos stepping forward, notching up the volume and speeding up just a bit, revealing the intricacy of their parts. Yet for all its popularity, Aventura never takes on arena bombast; its bachata keeps a gentle touch.In many Aventura songs  including its career-making 2002 hit and concert finale, Obsesin  the singer is a man in love with a woman he doesnt have. Hes lost her; she cant stay with him; shes attached to someone else; shes marrying someone else. And in his suavely tender falsetto, Romeo Santos tells her how desirable she is, how jealous he is and how he cant live without her.On Thursday night, very few songs glanced at tough circumstances beyond romance  No Lo Perdona Dios, a post-abortion recrimination, and Amor de Madre, about a single mothers sacrifices for her criminal son  but love songs filled nearly the entire concert.Despite the humble importuning of his lyrics, Romeo Santos was all smiling confidence and easy flirtation, rolling his hips to waves of squeals; Henry Santos, who took over for brief stretches during Romeos wardrobe changes, was just as suave. Joining them, from start to finish, were the high voices of the women in the audience who knew every word and savored every endearment.Romeo Santos mischievously polled the audience. Where are the men tonight? he asked in Spanish, and got a brief group shout in return. Where are the women tonight? he continued, and got a sustained scream that was twice as loud. They always gonna win, he counseled. Dont go against them. Join them."}
{"text": "A police hunt for a Missouri couple wanted for a series of abductions and robberies across the South ended early Friday on the Florida Panhandle in a barrage of gunfire that left one of the suspects dead.Law officials had tracked Blake Fitzgerald and Brittany Harper, both 30, in the Pensacola area for several tense hours after an armed robbery there late Thursday. The couple managed to elude capture in a stolen vehicle, then on foot, and finally in another stolen vehicle.The two were cornered overnight Friday in Milton, outside Pensacola. In an armed standoff, Mr. Fitzgerald was killed, Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia County said. Ms. Harper was wounded and taken to a hospital to treat injuries to her leg and ankle.Like most shooting incidents, what was a matter of seconds seemed like a matter of minutes, Sheriff Morgan said during a news conference on Friday. It occurred very, very quickly.Sheriff Morgan praised what he characterized as a sprawling effort by law enforcement officials to catch the suspects of a crime spree that has dominated local news reports for days.Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper, both from Joplin, Mo., are suspected in a series of crimes that began Sunday in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where, the authorities said, they kidnapped a hotel clerk and drove off with him in his car.The clerk, Kyle Dease, told local reporters that the couple said they were trying to get to Panama City, Fla., where they planned to marry and start a new life.He goes, Hey, I hate to do this but, I need you to give me all your money and I need you to give me your car keys, Mr. Dease said in an interview with the television station WBRC-TV.What followed was a spree of abductions, home invasions and robberies across Alabama, Georgia and Florida, officials said. In each case, the victims were released unharmed, but the police warned that Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper were armed and could lash out if they felt threatened. The United States Marshals Service offered $10,000 for their capture.At about 8 p.m. Thursday, the Florida authorities got a report of an armed robbery at a Famous Footwear store in Pensacola by two people whose descriptions matched that of Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper.Witnesses also gave a description of their vehicle, which was discovered hours later abandoned in a driveway about five miles from the store. At about 12:30 a.m. officials received word that the fugitives had entered a home, held its residents hostage and then fled in their red truck.Shortly after, law enforcement caught up with the truck and cornered the suspects on a narrow residential road in Milton, just east of Pensacola.Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper refused to surrender, Sheriff Morgan said, leading to an armed standoff that lasted about 15 minutes. The couple then left the vehicle and tried to enter an occupied home, Sheriff Morgan said. Escambia County officers opened fire around 1 a.m.The authorities declined to say whether Mr. Fitzgerald or Ms. Harper engaged the officers with a weapon. During the news conference on Friday, asked to confirm reports that Mr. Fitzgerald had used Ms. Harper as a shield, Sheriff Morgan paused for a moment, then said: Yes. Yes.Carlen Baird-Baptista, a bail bondsman in Joplin, Mo., who had Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper as clients, said the two often ran into trouble with the law and struggled with methamphetamine addiction. She said Mr. Fitzgerald had three children, including a newborn.He was a father and a son with a horrible addiction, she said on Friday.Sasha Odell, a Facebook friend of Ms. Harpers, reached out to her on the social network overnight Friday, making a plea to return to Missouri that came too late.Brittany, this is so not worth it, Ms. Odell wrote, adding, Everyone is worried sick about you. We miss you. We are heartbroken and scared for you. We still and always will love you. We just want you to be safe. Please. The whole family is worried. Please. Just PLEASE. Come home. Turn yourself in. We all love you.Ms. Harper faces charges of home invasion robbery, false imprisonment and grand theft auto, said State Attorney William Eddins."}
{"text": "Attorney General Kathleen Kanes law license will remain suspended after the State Supreme Court on Friday denied her request to have it reinstated while she fights criminal charges of leaking grand jury material and lying about it. The court said she did not seek the recusal of Justice Michael Eakin early enough and therefore waived her ability to object on that basis to the courts unanimous decision to suspend her license in September. The courts action could pave the way to an unprecedented vote in the Senate on whether to remove her from office. A spokesman said that Ms. Kane, a first-term Democrat, was disappointed but not surprised. A Senate committee voted along party lines last month to hold a floor vote on removing her if the court denied her request. All four Republicans were in favor and all three Democrats voted no. Ms. Kane had argued that Justice Eakin should not have participated in the vote because of his involvement in a salacious email scandal. She has released hundreds of emails, including some that Justice Eakin, a Republican, sent and received through a private email account. He has been suspended awaiting trial before an ethics court."}
{"text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defended a recommendation that sexually active women refrain from drinking alcohol if they are not using birth control after it spurred a strong backlash, with many women saying they considered the suggestion insulting, severe and impractical.Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the C.D.C., said in an interview Friday, We werent as clear as we had hoped to be.The C.D.C. report released on Tuesday focused on the possibility that children may develop fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, estimating that 3.3 million women between the ages of 15 and 44 who drink alcohol while not using birth control risked exposing their infants to the disorders.The report suggested that women who intend to get pregnant or could get pregnant should not drink alcohol, as about half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned and most women do not know they are pregnant until four to six weeks into the pregnancy.But the idea that fertile women who are not using contraception should indefinitely not drink alcohol was not well received by many women. Dr. Schuchat, however, said the C.D.C.s intention was to explain the risk of drinking before a woman knows she is pregnant and to show that the harmful effects of alcohol on a developing baby were completely preventable  not to prescribe a lifestyle or suggest women plan their entire lives around a hypothetical baby.Were really all about empowering women to make good choices and to give them the best information we can so they can decide what they want to do themselves, Dr. Schuchat said. Alcohol in that period can be particularly risky, so we wanted to make sure people are aware of that. What they do with that information is, of course, up to them.Much of the response to the recommendation, however, was negative. Jezebel, a website devoted to womens issues, called it an unrealistic warning. The Washington Post said it was incredibly condescending. And Slate called it swath-yourself-in-bubble-wrap thinking.Its underlying message was unmistakable: Women should consider themselves first a vessel for human life and make decisions about their health and behavior based on that possibility, Rebecca Ruiz wrote at Mashable.Some organizations, however, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, applauded the recommendation.Drinking during pregnancy has long been linked to the disorders, which can stunt childrens growth and cause lifelong disabilities. In October, a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics said that no amount of alcohol should be considered safe to drink during any trimester of pregnancy.The C.D.C. report said that, although 90 percent of women stop drinking alcohol once they know they are pregnant, three in four women who intend to get pregnant do not stop drinking when they stop using birth control. That would suggest people think less about the effects of alcohol in the early parts of the first trimester  when they may be unaware of the pregnancy  a time during which developing children are already at risk, according to the C.D.C.I absolutely respect women, and want them to be empowered to make the choices that are important to them, Dr. Schuchat said. Some of the coverage that portrayed the C.D.C. as only thinking about women as incubating babies was a big misunderstanding of our attitude."}
{"text": "BEIJING   After North Koreas leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered his army to build a world-class ski resort, the imported equipment for it was soon at hand, including snowmobiles, snowblowers and even a mile-long cable car system manufactured by a leading Austrian company.By almost any estimate, the sale of such items appears to violate the intent of United Nations sanctions meant to punish the North for its nuclear weapons program  specifically, sanctions targeting luxury goods, intended to cover products like Champagne and caviar, yachts and expensive cars.But China, whose companies were involved in providing the equipment for the Masikryong ski resort, which opened in 2013, told a United Nations panel that those sanctions did not apply because skiing is a normal activity in North Korea, a country where most of the population is impoverished and food shortages are common.Skiing is a popular sport for people, and ski equipment or relevant services are not included in the list of prohibited luxury goods, the Chinese said, according to last years annual report from the United Nations panel, which monitors sanctions violations.Weeks after North Korea detonated its fourth nuclear bomb, and days after it said it would soon launch another long-range rocket, the United States and China are still at loggerheads over how  or whether  to deepen sanctions against the isolated nation. And as the example of the skiing equipment shows, even the sanctions currently in place often prove toothless.The United Nations sanctions, imposed in 2006 and tightened since then, still allow China to trade with North Korea in vital sectors like oil, banking and shipping  but billions of dollars worth of luxury items also manage to slip through.While luxury goods may seem a relatively minor issue, experts on North Korea say they help to ensure the loyalty of the tiny elite around Mr. Kim, helping to keep his government intact.Tensions between Washington and Beijing over who is to blame for North Koreas growing nuclear arsenal burst into the open again this week, after the North said Tuesday that it would launch a satellite into orbit this month. The United States and its allies believe the true purpose of such launches is to eventually develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can deliver a nuclear warhead.Daniel Russel, the United States assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said such a launch would be an unmistakable slap in the face to those who argue that you just need to show patience and dialogue with the North Koreans but not sanctions, a clear reference to China.In response, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, suggested Wednesday that it was the United States that had lost the most from the North Korean announcement. As for whose face the D.P.R.K. slapped, the country itself knows well, Mr. Lu said, using the initials for North Koreas formal name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.But on Friday, President Obama spoke by telephone with President Xi Jinping about the planned missile test, and in a summary of the call, the White House said that both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.They agreed that a test would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, and that a strong and united international response to North Koreas provocations was important.The Norths announcement was an embarrassing setback for China, coming just hours after one of its senior diplomats, Wu Dawei, had arrived in Pyongyang. Both China and the United States had known, based on satellite imagery, that the North was planning another launch, and one of Mr. Wus main goals for the trip had been to persuade the North Koreans not to proceed, diplomats said. The dates the North gave for the launch suggested it was likely to occur as China celebrates its weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, starting Sunday.On his return to Beijing on Thursday, Mr. Wu conceded that China had little leverage over its recalcitrant ally. I said everything that must be said. I did what must be done, he told reporters. But what the outcome will be, I dont know yet.Mr. Wu had an unpleasant task, said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international studies at Renmin University. That the North Koreans carry on regardless and announce their launch plans makes it more embarrassing for China, which has been arguing against more crippling sanctions and urging countries to solve the problem peacefully, he said.The Chinese hope to prevent tougher sanctions for fear that the North will become a hostile neighbor, a policy that diplomats said appears to have been shaped by President Xi Jinping last summer. In talks last week with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Secretary of State John Kerry made little headway in persuading China to toughen sanctions against North Korea, and he warned that the United States would most likely move ahead on its own.Tougher sanctions legislation is moving through Congress that, among other things, would target Chinese banks that do business with North Korea. The administration has been reluctant to call for such sanctions, known as secondary sanctions, and it is not clear what the White House would do about the legislation, American experts said.The luxury goods sanctions are one area where there is plenty of room to close loopholes exploited by Chinese middlemen and traders, to whom the government turns a blind eye, experts on North Korea say.Chinese customs data showed that North Korea imported $2.09 billion in luxury goods between 2012 and 2014, according to recent congressional testimony by Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Among the items that have slipped through the sanctions are Mercedes-Benz S-Class cars, photographs of which appeared in last years United Nations report. An unidentified American company armored the cars, the report said. It also said that a luxury yacht worth as much as $6 million, made by a British company, Princess Yachts International, made it into North Korea and has been used by Mr. Kim.In 2014, China exported $37 million worth of computers; $30 million of tobacco; $24 million of cars; and $9 million of air-conditioning equipment to the North, according to trade statistics from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. In all these categories, China was the top exporter, the United Nations said.The cable cars for the Masikryong ski resort, which are at least 30 years old and out of fashion on European ski slopes, were made by Doppelmayr, an Austrian company, and used for years in Ischgl, a skiing town in Austria. After the resort decided to install new cable cars, the old ones were sold to an Austrian secondhand dealer, Pro-Alpin, according to Ekkehard Assmann, head of marketing at Doppelmayr. Pro-Alpin, in turn, sold the cable cars to an unidentified Chinese company, according to Pro-Alpins website. The Chinese company then arranged for the equipment to be shipped to North Korea.The luxury goods sanctions have a glaring loophole: Each country is permitted to define what it considers luxury goods. The United States has published a detailed list, down to such items as vanity cases, binoculars and television sets larger than 29 inches. The European Union says articles and equipment for skiing, golf, diving and water sports are luxury goods and bans them from export to North Korea.But China has failed to publish such a list and has not honored those of other countries, the documents of the United Nations panel show. Because it has never defined luxury goods, China can argue that cable cars for Mr. Kims prestige resort were permissible, even justifying them as equipment for the masses."}
{"text": "A high-ranking Michigan regulator was fired Friday for her role in the drinking water crisis in Flint, broadening the fallout from a situation that has endangered the health of children, prompted criminal investigations and become an issue in the presidential campaign.Liane Shekter Smith, who led the Michigan Department of Environmental Qualitys Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit, was fired after a disciplinary conference. Her firing followed the resignations in December of the departments director, Dan Wyant, and chief spokesman, Brad Wurfel, both of whom were criticized for failing to recognize the scope of Flints water problems and for belittling those who attempted to raise alarms. A fourth employee, who worked under Ms. Shekter Smith, has been suspended.Putting the well-being of Michiganders first needs to be the top priority for all state employees, Gov. Rick Snyder said in a statement about the firing. Anything less than that is unacceptable. The D.E.Q. is working to change this culture and ensure mistakes that endanger our residents dont occur again.Though a number of government agencies have been faulted for their response in Flint, the Environmental Quality Department has been held up by critics as particularly egregious. That agency failed to require corrosion controls mandated under federal law when Flint changed its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. The lack of anti-corrosion chemicals caused pipes to disintegrate and leach lead into the water. Lead, which is especially harmful to children, is toxic and can have irreversible health effects. After initially dismissing outsiders who warned of the lead risk, Environmental Quality officials admitted in October that they had erred in not requiring corrosion controls.In recent weeks, Michigans attorney general, the F.B.I. and other federal agencies have announced investigations. Mr. Snyder, who has apologized to Flint residents, has been under fire. Hillary Clinton has announced plans to visit Flint on Sunday, and she and Bernie Sanders will hold a debate there next month.On Friday, Mr. Sanders, responding to the release of emails that showed state and local officials had also delayed warning residents about an outbreak of Legionnaires disease that they suspected could be related to the water supply, again called for the resignation of Mr. Snyder, a Republican.A Republican-led Congressional committee has also targeted the United States Environmental Protection Agency for scrutiny. At a hearing on Wednesday, committee members pressed the agency for an explanation of why top officials waited months to publicize their own scientists concerns about lead in Flint. Susan Hedman, a presidential appointee who oversaw the E.P.A. regional office in charge of Michigan, announced her resignation last month."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Where We See Tangled Trees, He Sees Social Networks (The Saturday Profile, Jan. 30): Peter Wohlleben, a German forest ranger, is right. Trees are social beings and nurturers. I know because one nurtured me.The coconut palm in our front yard was my best childhood friend. Every day I would sit against its bark and talk about everything while massaging its trunk. When ripe coconuts would drop, I savored the sweet milk, shielded from the broiling sun by glorious green fronds.In 1971 there was an outbreak of lethal yellowing in Miami, a disease that primarily affected coconut palms, killing thousands of them. We lived in a Miami suburb.When its fronds turned yellow, the third stage of the disease, inevitably followed by death, I was devastated. One afternoon, I wrapped my legs and arms around its trunk and loudly begged for it not to die, openly spilling tears on its bark, not caring that people outside or in passing cars witnessed such naked desperation.All the coconut palms in our neighborhood died, except mine. It survived, watching over me for years afterward.MICHAEL ROYCEForest Hills, Queens"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   In a corridor just a few feet from the floor of the United States Senate hangs a 19th-century oil painting of Henry Clay, the dexterous and venerated Kentucky lawmaker. He is portrayed with his hands folded and his lips pursed with slight impatience, as if, like his greatest admirer, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, he longs to escape formality and get back to the business of legislating.The portrait, purchased by the United States government in 1881 for $4,000 along with nearby paintings depicting Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun, is among scores of oil portraits that decorate the United States Capitol.Today, were Mr. Clay to be memorialized in the traditional fashion  the trio of images would have cost $99,104.67 in todays dollars  someone would have to shake a tin cup at donors. Or maybe start a super PAC.Taxpayer-funded oil paintings of members of Congress  as well as of the president, the vice president and cabinet members  have been officially banned, thanks to an amendment to the latest federal budget conceived by Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who was offended by the practice.The savings to taxpayers are negligible by federal standards. The cost of the portraits, according to a report prepared by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, averages roughly $25,000 apiece. Eliminating the funding, the report said, saves the government less than $500,000 annually. Context alert: The Pentagons new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter costs $98 million   without the engine. Thats about 3,920 portraits.But in a trillion-dollar federal budget, in which it is increasingly hard to make a significant dent in spending short of cutting entire programs, agencies or war efforts, lawmakers love to find small symbolic savings, especially those that take a whack at the perks of the powerful.Families struggle to pay their mortgage and feed their families, Mr. Cassidy said, while the federal government spends money on paintings of government officials that are often placed in the back of a government bureaucracy, never to be seen by the public.Mr. Cassidy tucked the ban into a 2014 spending bill, and it was recently renewed in the budget for another two years. He tried to make the ban  the Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act, or Ego Act  permanent, but Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, personally objected to the measure on the Senate floor, leaving some Republicans to snicker that he just wanted his painting paid for when he retires next year.Portraits of former House speakers and Senate leaders are among those historically paid for by taxpayers. (Mr. Reids office would not comment.)Mr. Cassidy and other sponsors of the measure, like Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, were particularly irked by a $22,500 portrait of John Bryson, who served as secretary of the Department of Commerce for a mere eight months, and the $38,350 spent by the Environmental Protection Agency for a portrait of the onetime administrator Lisa Jackson.They and others believe that officials should either pay for their portraits themselves  as many already do  or better yet, take a selfie.The expensive antiquated notion that all of these officials should get portraits is nonsense, said Steve Ellis, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense. A simple photograph would do. This is more about stroking egos than preserving history.Oil portraiture has served a role in documenting American history from the time of the colonies. Art in Congress was acquired over time as the Capitol was constructed. Patriotic and commemorative art was sought, with the intent of committing the people and events of a new nation to posterity. The collection represents American history in many ways, said Melinda K. Smith, the Senate curator. They are not just portraits. There is a story behind each one of them.For instance, another painting of Mr. Clay  he served as a senator, secretary of state and House speaker, in addition to running for president several times  depicts him in the Old Senate Chamber, of which there are no known photographs, memorializing the final months of his life and the first session of the 32nd Congress. Consider, too, the portrait of Mike Mansfield, the Senate majority leader, in an unusually casual full-length pose. He was essentially tricked into standing for it, as he often claimed that he would rather not be remembered.The Senate collection largely comprises 19th-century art and classic formal portraiture, while the House has traditional and more contemporary portraits.In one House hallway hangs a striking portrait of the first black female elected to Congress, Shirley Chisholm of New York, seemingly towering over the Capitol, a finger upheld in defiance. One can also view the likeness of Tom Lantos of California, onetime chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, depicted with his poodle, and Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the former head of the Armed Services Committee, rumpled, a tad frenzied and hanging out with his dog, Junket.Many portraits hang in the public and restricted areas of the Capitol, in committee hearing rooms and out of visitors sight, such as the leadership offices, where heads of state are greeted.Art in the Capitol follows American portraiture history. Oil portraits were an important method of chronicling the 18th- and 19th-century lives of the powerful and well-to-do, said Brandon Brame Fortune, the chief curator at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. (Martha Washington commissioned portraits of herself and George.)Later in the 19th century, some of the government offices began to pay for portraits, she said, through both public and private funds. Portraits today use the same techniques, the same materials. They really havent changed, she said. Oil painting is very much alive and well.Portraits have come under attack as frivolous before. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter derided them as a luxury, yet the practice continued. Taxpayer, private and other fund-raising has been employed, and some portraits are gifts.A portrait of former Representative Edith Nourse Rogers, Republican of Massachusetts, the longest-serving female member of the House and a staunch advocate of veterans, was paid for by funds collected by veterans who donated the works to the House.There was talk last summer of removing statues and portraits of Confederate leaders from the Capitol after the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina State House.But many objected, including Mr. McConnell, who noted that the portraits of Mr. Webster of Massachusetts, Mr. Clay of Kentucky and Mr. Calhoun of South Carolina were chosen by a five-member panel headed by a certain senator of the day: John F. Kennedy. The Capitol is a working history museum, he said."}
{"text": "DURHAM, N.C.   Duke is trying to get back to being Duke again.For the Blue Devils, the first step is getting their Hall of Fame coach, Mike Krzyzewski, back on the bench after he missed a game because of illness.He was scheduled to make his return Saturday when North Carolina State visits, and Duke was hoping that a confidence-boosting win at Georgia Tech in Krzyzewskis absence will be followed by more wins and, eventually, a return to the Top 25.You never want anything bad to happen, but in a way, were always looking for an opportunity in anything negative that happens, guard Grayson Allen said Friday. And for us, weve been able to grow and get tougher as a team, and its something our team has needed.He added, Weve become a tougher team, become more together.For much of January, Duke (16-6, 5-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) did not resemble the program that produced five national championships in 24 years, the most recent having come nine months earlier. These Blue Devils spent seven weeks in the Top 10.With a short bench made even shorter when forward Amile Jefferson broke his foot, Duke lost four of five and dropped out of the national rankings for the first time since 2007.While Jefferson has been sidelined, it has been an up-and-down run for the Blue Devils. They looked like championship contenders in rallying to beat North Carolina State by 10 points on Jan. 23; two nights later, they were dominated in a loss at Miami that knocked them out of the Top 25.It looked as if the nadir might come during a trip to Georgia Tech, as the team traveled to Atlanta without Krzyzewski, who remained in Durham after becoming ill following the team meal. Doctors at the universitys hospital advised Krzyzewski, 68, to stay behind.The freshman Luke Kennard said not having Krzyzewski along had made him a little nervous.Not that we didnt think we were going to win or anything, Kennard added. When Coach is there, he makes you feel comfortable.Kennard concluded, We knew we had to give him a win.From the outside, that did not appear likely.But spurred on by seven 3-pointers from Allen and an improved second-half defense, Duke rallied for an 80-71 victory.The guys that we have in this locker room respond well to adversity, and we are led by people who can coach us through adversity, Allen said, referring not only to Krzyzewski but to the associate head coach, Jeff Capel, who was in charge against Georgia Tech.And that always helps, because adversity gives you a tremendous opportunity to grow and get better, Allen said. You dont always want to learn the hard way, but sometimes that can be good for you.In a video posted to the teams website, Krzyzewski said that the team had responded beautifully, but that he had expected it. He also praised Capel for doing things his own way.That included a late switch out of a zone defense to man-to-man  Thats like the Duke defense, Kennard said  and playing the 7-foot freshman Antonio Vrankovic for the first time since Dec. 28.Krzyzewski said: In Jeffs case, it wasnt just following a game plan. He followed his own instincts, and thats what you want. You dont want somebody to try to be somebody else. You want them to be themselves, and thats what I want in our program  to be themselves and have ownership, and they can react in the best possible way, and they were able to do that."}
{"text": "TEHRAN   Only weeks into what was widely anticipated to be a helter-skelter, post-sanctions rush of Western money and expertise into Iran, limits to the countrys opening are beginning to emerge as the conservative leadership seeks to limit the reach of Western influences.Behind the headlines announcing big business contracts with European companies it is becoming increasingly clear that, so far, the only deals being struck have been with the state-backed conglomerates. These are the groups that dominate major industrial and commercial sectors of the Iranian economy and are tightly controlled by pension funds and investment companies linked to state organizations, like the Revolutionary Guards.As a result, little or nothing is trickling down to the lower levels of Irans beleaguered but still enormous private sector. We have a conflict of interest with the government, said Bahman Esghi, the secretary general of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. Because they have outgrown all their competitors.All the major international deals signed in recent weeks have involved state or semistate-backed industries. The national carrier, Iran Air, signed a deal to buy more than 100 planes from Airbus. The Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization, one of the largest state entities, started a $2 billion joint venture with an Italian steel producer, Danieli. PSA Peugeot Citron of France will invest $439 million in carmaker Iran Khodro.But when smaller private businesses reach out to their foreign counterparts the response they get is still: how will you pay? Nuclear sanctions might be lifted but almost all international banks continue to shy away from the Iranian market because of unilateral American regulations that label Iran as a state sponsor of terror.We are not getting any credit, inside or outside of the country, we cant make transfers and the government has other priorities, Mr. Esghi said. Next week Mr. Esghi, the public face of the largest private business ownership organization in the country, will be shutting down his own business, a bus factory, and sending his remaining 14 employees home. The reason, he said, is that there is no work and no prospect of any, even after the lifting of sanctions.Ill be the unemployed secretary general of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, he said. Ironic, isnt it?The lifting of the sanctions, Mr. Esghi said, will have some positive effects for those in the private sector who manage to get their hands on some of the money coming in. But mainly, it seems, the government is getting fatter and fatter, he said.President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday repeated the governments aim of achieving 8 percent growth this year, not an unreasonable goal given the influx of frozen assets and the enormous investment needed for Iran to modernize facilities grown decrepit after years of sanctions. But to achieve such growth levels, experts here say, particularly in an era of low oil prices, would require an easing of financial strictures that Irans conservative leaders show no signs of tolerating.Some analysts say the state-backed conglomerates are the only entities able to handle the $50 billion or so in annual investment that the country needs.Our bigger companies are our top priority, said Amin Amanzadeh, a financial reporter for several Iranian newspapers. They are the only ones who can handle foreign investment. Also, if they improve the whole economy will.But critics of the quasi-socialist conglomerate system dismiss such claims, saying it is notoriously corrupt and inefficient. More likely, they say, the conservative leaderships overriding aim is to keep Western influence in the economy and society to a minimum.Irans hard-line factions do not dispute the point. Investments through our big enterprises can be controlled, said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst who is close to Irans leaders. Really opening up the country, in the way some emerging-market countries have, is out of the question, he said.That would provide leverage to Western governments and investors, leverage they would use to influence our politics, culture and society.Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been emphasizing that point ever since the nuclear deal was signed in July. Most analysts say it will be a long time, if ever, before Iran relaxes controls even to the level of China when it began reforms in the 1970s.Already the influx of foreigners that comes with the foreign investments just agreed to will be an issue for the hard-liners who say they protect Irans ideology, Mr. Esghi said. There are currently fewer than 1,000 Westerners living in Tehran, a city of 12 million. Imagine a hundred thousand living here, he added. They dont have the stomach for that.For President Hassan Rouhani, who ran on the promise of lifting sanctions and ending Irans isolation, the continuing restrictions could pose political problems. Although sanctions were lifted only two weeks ago, Iranians are already complaining about the glacial pace of change.Sure there is money coming in, said Reza Alaverdi, a porter at Tehrans grand bazaar as he was pushing a cart laden with locally produced shirts through the narrow alleyways. Its just not coming to me.One of the few indicators of change visible to all, Irans national currency, the rial, has not moved since the lifting of the sanctions. The government wants to keep the price of the dollar high, now that they have access to dollars, said one money changer who refused to give his name.The housing market has stalled, as have land prices, a reflection some say of the crash in the oil market. As long as oil prices are low not much will change, said Ismael Tabrizi, a watch seller.Those in the private sector have few hopes of fast improvement, said one entrepreneur, frustrated that international partners are not providing credit and banks refuse to make transfers.The problem he says, is that while the state-backed conglomerates cinch deals with the help of special guarantees, the government is doing nothing to help smaller businesses and entrepreneurs secure credit.I just went to a conference in Dubai, said Kaveh Sheikholeslami, an importer of neurosurgery equipment. All the Western manufacturers wanted to sit down with him, he said. But he could not close any deals.I wanted to buy a $30,000 product, but they asked me, Can you transfer to our bank account? I had to say no, finished my coffee and moved on."}
{"text": "Updated, Feb. 8, 10:00 p.m. |  Given Floridas special vulnerability to rising seas and other consequences of human-driven global warming (which I first wrote about in 1988), its not surprising that one of the first efforts to break the partisan impasse in the House around this issue has come from two lawmakers from the south end of that state  Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo and Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat.PhotoRepresentative Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, has teamed up with Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican,to create a bi-partisan caucus on climate change.Credit Ted Deutch/ FacebookTheyve created a Climate Solutions Caucus in the House to explore policy options that address the impacts, causes, and challenges of our changing climate, according to House filings quoted last week byCitizens Climate Lobby.Heres the mission:The Caucus will serve as an organization to educate members on economically-viable options to reduce climate risk and protect our nations economy, security, infrastructure, agriculture, water supply and public safety.This is a promising baby step toward sanity in a body that has been so utterly paralyzed on this issue for far too long.It builds on other signs that common ground can be found on boosting community resilience to coastal and climatic hazards and even on renewable energy, as was illustrated in passage of a big spending bill in December extending tax credits for solar and wind energy (even as it ended the 40-year-old ban on oil exports, a move with minor environmental consequences, as Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations explained).The Citizens Climate Lobby post on the bipartisan climate caucus included this constructive statement from Curbelo:I am proud to serve as a Co-Chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, the first bipartisan caucus to address climate change in the U.S. House of Representatives. By exploring policy options that address the impacts of a changing climate we can effectively mitigate the inevitable effects it will have on our environment, as well as our economy.On Feb. 5, Samantha Page playfully kicked off her Climate Progress post on the development this way:A bipartisan caucus in the U.S House of Representatives  on climate change?Yes, this is really happening.Theres quite a contrast between Curbelos position and the shape-shifting views of presidential hopeful Senator Marco Rubio, who in 2014 said, I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it, and continues, at best, to offer oblique, meaningless replies when the issue comes up.This excerpt from a Daily Kos piece nicely summarizes a lot of what I found sifting his statements:Rubio has flip-flopped dramatically on climate change over the years. In 2008, he supported the creation of rules that would restrict carbon emissionsi.e., cap and trade. By last April he was questioning the basic science of climate change itself, offering this mealy-mouthed attempt to placate the anti-science rightwing without going whole hog into the denial camp: Humans are not responsible for climate change in the way some of these people out there are trying to make us believe. Last January Rubio (and Cruz) voted No on a Senate amendment that acknowledged the significant effect human activity has had on climate change.In a recent Newsweek feature, Nina Burleigh nicely captured the disconnect between local Republican officials dealing on the ground with rising-sea realities and Rubio, who is clearly beholden to deeply partisan messages, at least until the primary season ends.Heres the local scene:South Florida business leaders and even many local Republican politicians are no longer in climate change denial. Now, deep in the fine print of resolutions and memoranda being passed around among the various task forces in the area, one sees the mantra Elevate. Isolate. Relocate.Read this point from Curbelo, gently dinging Rubio:Like Rubio, Curbelo is a young, second-generation Cuban-American. He says theres a middle way between alarm and ignoring the problem. Presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, who are very familiar with these challenges, should, on the national stage, be sincere with the American publicin this case, Republican primary votersand tell them that we are already seeing major challenges and threats to our ability to live in South Florida.Much of what she reports, and Curbelos position reflects, builds on what Yales Dan Kahan, who studies the human tendency to practice cultural cognition, found in 2014 in the Sunshine State: What SE Florida can teach us about the *political* science of climate change.Hopefully, as Rubio tries to find the center in later primaries after months of courting his partys edge, hell listen to folks like Curbelo and pay attention to findings like those I wrote on last year in this post: No Red and Blue Divide When it Comes to Renewable Energy Innovation and CO2 Rules.For more, click back to As Presidential Debaters Dodge Climate, 10 House Republicans Resolve to Pursue Environmental Stewardship, a post last fall on a resolution on environmental stewardship introducedby Representative Chris Gibson, a moderate Republican from my neck of the woods, the Hudson Valley.Heres my tweet on the Florida news (follow me @revkin):!

{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Pentagon on Friday released 198 photographs from detainee abuse investigations in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The pictures, taken more than a decade ago during the Bush administration, consist largely of close-up views of scrapes and bruises on detainees bodies.However, the military is continuing to block the disclosure of about 1,800 other photos from the same criminal investigations, saying that their release would endanger American service members serving abroad.The photographs are a focus of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in 2004 by the American Civil Liberties Union in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal. That case has resulted in the release of many documents and memos about abusive interrogation practices, but it ran into turbulence in 2009 over the photos.After making public Bush-era memos about torture in response to the same lawsuit, the Obama administration was initially going to comply with an order to release the first group of pictures from the detainee abuse investigations as well.But a political backlash over the wave of disclosures was growing, with some former Bush administration officials, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, denouncing the release of the memos as endangering the country.Against that backdrop, Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, appealed to President Obama to reconsider the release of the photographs, warning that it could provoke attacks against American troops.Mr. Obama changed his mind and obtained legislation from Congress permitting the defense secretary to exempt the photos from disclosure under the information act. The reversal was an early milestone on secrecy policy for an administration that had promised to be the most transparent in history.Under the statute, the exemption expires after three years. Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Gatess successor as defense secretary, extended it in 2012, and the current Pentagon chief, Ashton B. Carter, extended it again in November, but decided that the 198 photos could be made public.Jameel Jaffer, an A.C.L.U. lawyer, said the selective disclosure of the presumably more innocuous photographs should not be a distraction from what was still being concealed.It forces you to ask what might be in the other photos that are still being withheld, he said. These ones show individuals with injuries of various severity. Whats in the 1,800 photographs the government still hasnt released?Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the criminal investigations into allegations of detainee abuse by American military personnel had substantiated about 14 cases and cleared 42 others. Of the substantiated cases, 65 service members received disciplinary action ranging from letters of reprimand to life imprisonment  including 26 who were convicted at courts-martial, he said.The president has made very clear, he said, that the United States will ensure the safe, lawful and humane treatment of individuals in U.S. custody in the context of armed conflicts, consistent with the treaty obligations of the United States, including the Geneva Conventions."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister of Ukraine who now leads a minority party in Parliament, said on Friday that she and her allies would staunchly oppose constitutional changes that the United States and European powers view as crucial to carrying out a peace agreement with Russia.Her remarks underscored the enormous obstacles still facing the nearly year-old peace accord, known as Minsk II. A shaky cease-fire has sharply reduced the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels launched a separatist insurgency in 2014, but the accord has never been enacted, largely because of acute disagreements over how voting in the region would be organized.Ms. Tymoshenkos comments, though not new, were particularly notable given that she made them in Washington. The United States has been one of the new Ukrainian governments strongest allies and one of its main supporters in securing help to prevent an economic collapse, including billions in credit from the International Monetary Fund.Wrapping up a weeklong visit in which she met with top administration officials and members of Congress, Ms. Tymoshenko, 55, also said that she would push for early parliamentary elections  the sooner, the better  which are opposed by the United States because the parties of President Petro O. Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk are virtually certain to lose seats.The two men are considered allies of the West. But both have been dogged by criticism that they have failed to sufficiently root out endemic corruption. This week, Ukraines economy minister, Aivaras Abromavicius, abruptly quit his post, saying, It has become clear that any kind of systemic reform is decisively blocked.The continuing corruption and the failure to carry out the Minsk accord have prompted some frustration among American and European officials. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with Mr. Poroshenko for four hours on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month and was said to have pressed the Ukrainian leader on both fronts.In an interview in her hotel suite at the Willard InterContinental, near the White House, Ms. Tymoshenko said that the Minsk agreement was flawed because it combined political and military issues, and that Ukraine could not move forward with regional elections until it had greater assurances regarding its security, including control of the border with Russia.She said that early parliamentary elections were needed to build public legitimacy and to reboot the government before the constitutional changes  which would grant greater autonomy to the disputed eastern regions  could win approval. But only Mr. Poroshenko can call early elections, and both he and Ukraines Western allies oppose the idea.In a bid to push the peace deal forward, Victoria J. Nuland, an assistant secretary of state, met last month with Vladislav Surkov, a senior adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin, in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The accord will also be a main topic of discussion next week at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Mr. Poroshenko is expected to come under heavy pressure from American and European officials to move ahead with the constitutional changes, as a precursor to elections in eastern Ukraine.But Ms. Tymoshenko said that Ukraines Western allies appeared to be putting their own political interests first.Both the European Union and the United States are facing their own complicated political concerns, she said, noting the United States presidential election and refugee crisis in Europe. The United States and the European Union want to end the Ukrainian problem at any cost, as fast as possible, she said.Ms. Tymoshenko spent 28 months in prison as the nemesis of former President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in the Maidan revolution two years ago. She was released in February 2014, a day after Mr. Yanukovych fled Kiev, the capital.She is hardly uncontroversial. Although her jailing was viewed as political, voters were clearly wary of her after she emerged from prison, and she and her party have struggled because of their association with past Ukrainian administrations notorious for entrenched corruption and pervasive mismanagement.Ms. Tymoshenko is widely known to harbor continuing national political ambitions. Her opposition to the constitutional changes and her push for early elections undoubtedly reflect a move to capitalize on the falling popularity and perceived political weakness of Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Yatsenyuk.The minority faction that her party, Fatherland, controls in Parliament does not by itself have enough votes to block the constitutional changes. But the changes, which can be approved only by a supermajority of 300 out of 450 votes, are also opposed by another influential minority party, Self-Reliance, and by numerous other lawmakers.Ms. Tymoshenko said that pushing too quickly to carry out the accord could allow Russia to retain the ability to destabilize Ukraine politically at Mr. Putins whim.It seems to me a fundamental mistake to try to end the Ukrainian conflict at any price, she said."}
{"text": "A judge cleared the way Friday for a former Salvadoran colonel to face charges in Spain that he helped plan the 1989 slayings of six Jesuit priests during El Salvadors civil war. The approval of extradition for the former colonel, Inocente Orlando Montano Morales, is a significant step in efforts to prosecute Salvadoran military officials on charges of murdering the priests, most of whom were natives of Spain. Mr. Montano has been the only one within reach of the Spanish authorities because of legal issues in El Salvador, where most of them still live. A federal magistrate judge, Kimberly Swank, ordered that federal marshals take custody of Mr. Montano, 73, so he can be turned over to Spain, pending final approval by State Department. The step is seen as a formality because lawyers already reviewed the case before turning it over to federal prosecutors. Mr. Montano served as the countrys vice minister of public security and was part of an inner circle of powerful military officers. The extradition fight began in 2011."}
{"text": "Instead of beheading Ashraf Fayadh, a poet convicted of apostasy, a court in Saudi Arabia has reduced his sentence to eight years in prison, 800 lashes and a public declaration of repentance.So is this enough to absolve Saudi Arabia of comparisons with the lslamic State, which is known for its extreme religious ideology and cruel summary judgments? No. Mr. Fayadhs crime, in essence, was committing poetry and art.The new sentence, made public on Tuesday, reversed the one handed down in November when Mr. Fayadh was convicted of blasphemy and illicit relationships with women. The charges were based on photographs and a book of his poetry that was published abroad years before.Mr. Fayadh, 35, was born in Saudi Arabia to a stateless family of Palestinian origin and was not known as a dissident, according to Ben Hubbard of The Times. He was active in Saudi Arabias small art scene, curating shows at home and abroad.In 2013, he was arrested after an argument in a cafe. Although Mr. Fayadh was released without charge, he was arrested again later and hit with the blasphemy charges. He was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison and 800 lashes. He appealed and, after a retrial, got the death penalty.This weeks sentence modification was the result of another appeal. It followed widespread condemnation by artists and human rights groups around the world. Who knows what would have happened if they hadnt spoken out.Saudi Arabia has come under a lot of fire lately and for good reason. The country follows an extremist version of Islam called Wahhabism that has inspired the Islamic State and other jihadis, and the judiciary is controlled by conservative clerics who are allowed a wide berth to apply Shariah law.Last year, the Saudi government carried out its highest number of executions in two decades. The Saudis bloody record has brought unfavorable comparisons to the Islamic State.It is time for Saudi authorities to end their unjust campaign to punish the poet for what PEN America, a press freedom advocacy group, describes as the simple human act of artistic expression."}
{"text": "President Obama hosted President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia in the White House this week to celebrate the imminent signing of a peace agreement that could end one of the longest-running conflicts in history.Having spent $10 billion over the past 15 years training and supporting Colombias security forces, Washington officials are understandably feeling proud of Americas contribution to the countrys turnaround. After nearly three and a half years of peace talks, the government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a Marxist-inspired insurgency, expect to sign an armistice in March.We all know that its easier to start wars than to end them, Mr. Obama said at an East Room ceremony. But after half a century of wrenching conflict, the time has come for peace.As Mr. Obamas phrasing suggests, the administration knows that even a formal peace accord cannot by itself heal the wounds of a long and painful conflict. The next phase will require a well-managed transitional justice process, a concerted effort to address the countrys entrenched inequality and new approach to counternarcotics. Mr. Obama hopes to contribute $450 million to the peace effort to build up legal institutions, improve education and promote economic growth.One of the early challenges of the post-truce era will be the establishment of special tribunals. The Colombian government and the FARC reached a deliberately vague agreement on transitional justice last year, which has raised valid concerns that serious war criminals could go largely unpunished.It is unrealistic to expect that every war crime committed during the five-decade war will be punished. However, the most serious crimes committed by FARC commanders and Colombian military personnel should lead to meaningful sanctions. If the tribunals are perceived as incompetent or too lenient, the prospect of a lasting peace will be in jeopardy.One of the main goals of Washingtons long effort to stabilize Colombia was to cut cocaine production in half. Yet the drug trade is still booming, kept afloat in large part by strong demand in the United States. There is no easy fix to this problem, but the time has clearly come for a new approach."}
{"text": "FRANKFURT  Volkswagen said on Friday that it would delay reporting its annual earnings and move back the date of its annual shareholders meeting because of uncertainty about the cost of its diesel emissions scandal.The delays reflect the companys problems from the fallout of its admission in September that it had equipped 11 million diesel vehicles with software that could enable them to cheat on emissions tests.The postponements announced on Friday also highlighted how difficult it was for Volkswagen to calculate the cost of the scandal and prepare credible financial statements. The company, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, faces official investigations in the United States and other countries and lawsuits by thousands of aggrieved car owners.A news conference to present the annual earnings report had been scheduled for March 10, and the annual meeting for April 21. The decision to delay the meeting will also put off a reckoning with fund managers and shareholders, who might have been expected to use the forum to criticize top Volkswagen managers like Hans Dieter Ptsch, the chairman of the supervisory board, and Matthias Mller, the chief executive.It shows that VW is very uncertain where to go from here, said Ferdinand Dudenhffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen. They dont know what to say to their shareholders.Eric Felber, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the decision to postpone the report and the annual meeting did not reflect any new information. The company simply decided it needed more time to reach conclusions about the costs it faces, he said.Volkswagen might be finding it difficult to arrive at figures that would be approved by outside auditors. The accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers already expressed reservations in its review of Volkswagens report on third-quarter earnings in October. The firm said that, because investigations of the scandal were not completed, it had not been able to determine whether the amount of money that Volkswagen had set aside was appropriate.The company has set aside 6.7 billion euros, or about $7.27 billion, to cover the cost of making the faulty diesel engines compliant with air quality regulations. In addition, Volkswagen will probably be required to pay billions of dollars, if not tens of billions, in fines and legal settlements. Analysts say the exact cost is impossible to predict.Despite the unexpected delay in financial reporting, Volkswagen shares rose 3 percent in late afternoon trading in Frankfurt after the company said that operating profit in 2015 would be about the same as in 2014, in line with earlier forecasts.It is not unusual for companies to delay earnings. But it is often a harbinger of bad news, according to a 2014 study by Eric So, an associate professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.Volkswagen acknowledged in September that it had installed so-called defeat devices in cars with diesel engines, including about 600,000 in the United States, to get around limits on nitrogen oxide pollutants linked to lung ailments.Volkswagens attempts to put the scandal behind it have been bumpy. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board have rejected the companys proposals to fix Volkswagen brand diesels, as well as some diesel vehicles produced by its other brands, Audi and Porsche, so they no longer exceed limits on tailpipe emissions.Mr. Mller caused a furor in the United States last month when he said during an interview with the radio broadcaster NPR that, We didnt lie. He later apologized and said, We fully accept the violation.Volkswagen sales have also suffered. In January, the company said sales of Volkswagen brand cars in the United States fell 15 percent compared with a year earlier, to about 20,000 vehicles. Sales of the Passat, a sedan made in Chattanooga, Tenn., that was supposed to lead a Volkswagen resurgence in the United States, fell 43 percent in January to about 3,600 vehicles.Perhaps more alarming for Volkswagen, sales have also been falling in Europe, where the company is by far the largest carmaker. Even in Germany, where Volkswagen is one of the largest employers, sales of VW brand cars fell 9 percent in January.In the European Union as a whole, the Volkswagen brands market share slipped to 11.5 percent in December from 12.6 percent in December 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which has not yet published figures for January. Rivals like Peugeot, Renault and Ford of Europe gained share.Volkswagen said on Friday that it would stick with plans to present an internal report in late April on who was responsible for the deception.The company said it would announce new dates for the report and for the meeting soon."}
{"text": "Louisville is voluntarily withholding its mens basketball team from this seasons Atlantic Coast Conference and N.C.A.A. tournaments, as the N.C.A.A. investigates a scandal in which a former basketball employee is accused of having purchased strippers and prostitutes for some recruits and their fathers from 2010 to 2014.James R. Ramsey, the university president, announced the decision, which he said he made in consultation with Athletic Director Tom Jurich, at a news conference Friday afternoon as Coach Rick Pitino, a two-time national championship winner, looked on.After hearing from N.C.A.A. staff, Ramsey said, he determined it was reasonable to conclude that violations had occurred in the mens basketball program in the past.Pitino reiterated previous statements that he had been unaware of the alleged violations. The accusations were first made in a book published late last year by a woman who said that Andre McGee, Louisvilles former director of basketball operations, hired her to provide strippers and prostitutes at 22 parties at the universitys residential hall for basketball players.Colleges frequently self-impose postseason bans if it becomes clear the N.C.A.A. is likely to do so in the future. Last year, Syracuse announced that it would withhold its mens basketball team from the postseason about a month before the N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions found violations related to players academics.Critics say that such bans deal the harshest punishment to current players  many of whom might not have borne responsibility for the alleged violations or even been on the team when they are said to have happened  and not to administrators and coaches.Louisville, ranked 19th, was coming off an upset victory over No. 2 North Carolina when the announcement was made.

Ms. Berman announced his hiring in a statement on Friday, calling Mr. Earley an exceptional leader with a sharp eye for terrific content.Ever since Mr. Earley left Fox, becoming one of the rare executives to leave a top television job without being promoted or pushed, Hollywood has been eager to know where he would land. My job had become increasingly operational, and I wanted to be closer to the creative side of the business again, Mr. Earley said by phone. As fate would have it, the opportunity to work with Gail again was the perfect fit.It will be a reunion for the two executives. For a number of years in the early 2000s, Ms. Berman ran the Fox broadcast network and Mr. Earley served as her head of communications and de facto chief of staff. By successfully introducing shows like American Idol and House, the two helped Fox become the top-rated network for the first time in its history.Ms. Berman left in 2005 to become president of Paramount Pictures. Mr. Earley continued to rise at Fox, ultimately becoming chief operating officer of the Fox Television Group, overseeing television marketing, research, talent relations and scheduling, among other duties, across multiple divisions.The Jackal Group, founded a year and a half ago after Ms. Bermans departure from BermanBraun, a company known for websites like Wonderwall and Purple Clover, already has shows on the air, including the comedy Cooper Barretts Guide to Surviving Life.

{"text": "JERUSALEM  Senator Bernie Sanders volunteered on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s, but he has always been vague about the specific location. Now, the mystery about the Democratic presidential candidates past appears to have been solved, in the archives of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Yossi Melman, a longtime Haaretz writer, remembers an interview he did with Mr. Sanders in 1990, the year he was elected to represent Vermont in the House. Haaretz dug up that clip, in which Mr. Sanders said he had spent several months in 1963 working on Kibbutz Shaar Haamakim, near Haifa in northern Israel, as a guest of the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.The movement, whose Hebrew name translates to The Young Guard, was a socialist, Zionist secular Jewish youth group founded in 1913 in Galicia, Austria-Hungary, and shared the name of a workers party in pre-1948 Palestine. The original 1990 article was titled The First Socialist and said that after spending time on the kibbutz with his wife at that time, Mr. Sanders seems to have lost his connection to Israel, Zionism and Judaism, Haaretz reported this week. Mr. Sanders has long described himself as a democratic socialist.Kibbutz members interviewed this week by Israeli and American Jewish news organizations said they did not remember Mr. Sanders specifically.The only thing I remember is that we had around 100 volunteers here, and some of them were French and some were American, Albert Ely, who is 79 and once managed the orchard, told The Forward, a New York-based Jewish newspaper. And someone named Bernard was an American. Usually Bernard is a French name.Israels Kibbutz Movement  the umbrella organization for the 250 communal settlements  had begun a Facebook campaign to find out where Mr. Sanders stayed. Mr. Sanders brother, Larry, who recently failed in his bid for the British Parliament, also spent time on two communal farms, in Kibbutz Matzuva (in western Galilee) and Kibbutz Yotvata (in the southern Negev), Haaretz reported.Mr. Ely said that on Shaar Haamakim, you care about your brother or your neighbor or whoever it is. The kibbutz was founded in Romania in 1929 and established in pre-state Israel in 1935. It saw the Soviet Union as a model, and often flew the red flag at outdoor events. Volunteers like Mr. Sanders would have internalized a political imperative to improve the lot of other, Mr. Ely said.I know that we left an imprint on those people, Mr. Ely said. The imprint was believe in people, and be responsible for them. Not only for yourself.Today, the kibbutz gets most of its income from a factory that makes solar water heaters, but the members still farm and tend cows.Dudu Haver, 83, the former kibbutz volunteer coordinator, told The Forward that volunteers would work for six hours in the morning, usually in agriculture, and then partake in cultural events in the afternoon.Well be glad to host Bernie Sanders here again on the kibbutz, he said."}
{"text": "Asked what Bernie Sanders was like as a kid brother, his brother, Larry, recalled on CNN last month that he was a very good athlete. Responding to a question by Chris Cuomo about this comment in last months CNNs Democratic Town Forum, Senator Sanders said that his elementary school in Brooklyn won the borough championship, and that he was a very good long-distance runner and captain of my cross-country team.If these remarks made Mr. Sanders more voter-friendly, they fell into a historical tradition by which the sports lives of presidents and presidential aspirants have served to enhance their political images.We all know how Theodore Roosevelt happily allowed his boxing, horseback riding, tennis and hiking to exemplify his activist, almost hyper approach to presidential power and to life. For those more conversant with the details of his upbringing, the sense that T.R. was almost always in motion showed the determination and other qualities of character that had enabled him to triumph over youthful physical frailty. This inspired people. For instance, a first-grade classmate of mine in Illinois, while showing me his T.R. bust, told me that he hoped to emulate the great man by surmounting his asthma to become an athlete.Politicians also use their preferences in sport to make themselves seem more accessible. While trying to court working-class Democrats who were turning more conservative, including what he called the hardhats, President Nixon had himself photographed while bowling on the underground White House lane. (Unfortunately for him, at least one of the pictures showed him stepping over the line, which may have ominously telegraphed that Nixon did not strictly abide by rules.)Nixon also went to great lengths to let Americans know what a football and baseball fan he was. During the election year of 1972, he publicly released a personal list of best baseball players he had watched play, including Ted Williams, Sandy Koufax, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson and Maury Wills. George H.W. Bush had a horseshoe pit  built behind the White House, which demonstrated that he was more Texas than Yale.Presidential hopefuls also enlist their sports lives to shore up possible weaknesses in their political personas. Franklin Roosevelt, while seeking the office for the first time in 1932, demonstrated his triumph over polio by swimming for the cameras.President Trumans public fast-walking and calisthenics (aboard ship, he once coached staff members and crewmen in a T-shirt that said Truman Athletic Club) showed off his stamina and excellent physical condition, which was important because when he left the presidency at age 68, he was one of the oldest to ever hold the office.John Kennedy suffered from an injured back and myriad other physical problems. His brother Robert later recalled that Jack spent more than half his life suffering intense physical pain. But what voters thought they saw was a president of vigor  swimming, sailing, golfing and playing touch football (although for J.F.K., this was mainly a vestige of earlier days).In August 1962, when he waded out of the surf before cameras in Santa Monica, Calif., he did not look like someone who had to give physical infirmity the slightest thought. Kennedy established his commitment to the nations fitness even before he was inaugurated, then expanded the presidents council on physical fitness to all age groups, and in 1963, started a campaign for Americans to go on 50-mile hikes.During Ronald Reagans campaign in 1980 and afterward, his image-makers, seeking to dispel concerns about his age, had him photographed on horseback and using a chain saw on his California ranch. And after he was shot in 1981, his aides promoted his robust physical recovery by letting it be known that he was pumping iron in the new upstairs White House gym.But while sports lives may enhance a leaders appeal, they can also take away. Although Gerald Ford was one of the best athletes to be president (he was a star football player for the University of Michigan and received offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers), he became better known for beaning spectators on golf courses and for slipping and falling down while walking on airplane stairs, which led to numerous lampoons by Chevy Chase on NBCs Saturday Night Live.Like Bill Clinton later on, Jimmy Carter became an avid runner, but while participating in a road race in Maryland during his tough political autumn of 1979, he nearly collapsed from heat exhaustion. Fairly or not, the image of the president gasping, with his knees buckling, seemed to capture Carters frustrations over gasoline lines, inflation and an impending primary challenge by Ted Kennedy. A George W. Bush commercial of 2004 sought to turn the windsurfing hobby of his opponent, John Kerry, into a metaphor for political overflexibility (Whichever way the wind blows).Dwight Eisenhower loved golf to such an extreme that when rain kept him indoors during his first spring in office, he said he felt so sorry for myself I could cry. But political foes tried to turn Ikes avid golfing life into a symbol of failure to concentrate on his job.Fans of his 1956 Democratic opponent, Adlai Stevenson, held up signs demanding a working President. In 1960, after the crash of an American U-2 spy plane on Soviet territory soured American relations with Moscow, the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, complained that the problem was that Eisenhower spent more time playing golf than being president.By his last year in the presidency, Ike was still wildly popular among Americans. But the suspicion that he spent too much time on the golf course was sufficiently widespread that some politicians sought to obscure the depth of their own passion for golf.In the spring of 1960, for instance, when the presidential aspirant John Kennedy teed off on a par-three hole with an old friend, Paul Fay, in Pebble Beach, Calif., he watched, aghast, as his ball dropped onto the green and rolled toward the cup. Most aficionados of the sport would be exhilarated to achieve a hole in one, but not Kennedy, who watched with relief as his ball stopped short. If that ball had gone into that hole, he said to Fay, in less than an hour, the word would be out to the nation that another golfer was trying to get into the White House."}
{"text": "As Sundays Super Bowl approached, Cam Newton defended the antics of the Carolina Panthers by pointing out that an N.F.L. play usually lasts for only four to six seconds and saying that anyone looking to judge him or his team should focus on what they do during that time, rather than being distracted by the irrelevant things that happen between plays.One of the finalists for the 2016 class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, who failed to gain election on his first time on the ballot, very likely knows what Newton is trying to say more than anyone else. Terrell Owens, a dominant wide receiver with a strong work ethic and a track record of consistency, still finds himself written off by many as a distraction, a head case or a prima donna  sometimes all three.A recounting of Owenss antics through the years certainly turns up a number of questionable and off-putting decisions, but while Brett Favre and Ken Stabler, who were both elected as part of the class of 2016, are celebrated for their colorful personalities and occasional mistakes, Owens has been criticized by many people for his. It is likely that Owenss personality played a role when the gathered voters chose to elect Favre, Stabler, Marvin Harrison, Kevin Greene, Orlando Pace, Tony Dungy, Dick Stanfel and Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. rather than Owens, a wide receiver whose statistical rsum can be topped only by those of Jerry Rice and perhaps Randy Moss.When he was told of the news on Saturday night, Owens took the high road on Twitter, saying: Unfortunately I did not make it. CONGRATS to the 2016 HOF CLASS. Thanks to ALL MY FANS for ur unwavering love & support. #ONLYGODCANJUDGEMEWhile many would place the blame squarely on Owenss broad shoulders if his personality has gotten in the way of his accomplishments, a look at him as a player rather than as a person, which is the mandate given to the voters, reveals a wide receiver with few peers. When his name comes up, though, it is still often met with a great deal of vitriol. One significant detractor is Mike Martz, who coached the St. Louis Rams during Owenss prime with the 49ers and believes that it is a travesty that Owens was even a finalist, saying that two of his receivers, Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce, should have been on the ballot instead.Surprised isnt the word, Martz told reporters. You cant print how I felt when T. O. leapfrogged those two. Thats just plain, out-and-out ridiculous.Martzs dislike for Owens allowed him to ignore the numbers. Martz claimed that Owens was getting extra credit for being colorful and that his players would be revealed to be superior if you focused on yards per catch or consistent production. In truth, Owens shines regardless of what wide receivers he is compared to. On the list of career records, he is sixth in receptions, second in receiving yards and third in receiving touchdowns, with Rice being the only player who is ahead of him in all three categories. He even had his share of playoff success, with a last-second winning touchdown reception against Favres Packers in 1999 and a tremendous effort in Super Bowl XXXIX, in which he had nine receptions for 122 yards despite playing with a still-healing broken leg.His totals stand out even more when you consider that Harrison, who was elected in his third time as a finalist, put up lesser numbers despite catching passes from Peyton Manning for almost his entire career. While Owens played with Steve Young in his first few seasons, and later spent some highly productive seasons with Donovan McNabb and Tony Romo, he also found similar success with lesser quarterbacks like Jeff Garcia, Tim Rattay and Ryan Fitzpatrick. It seemed that no matter the team, scheme or defense, Owens was very likely going to get the ball into the end zone.That Owens failed to gain election on his first try should not be all that surprising since, beyond the personality issue, the bar for election at his position is high. In recent years, a number of high-profile stars have been asked to wait a considerable amount of time before their elections. Andre Reed, who played in four Super Bowls for Buffalo, was a finalist eight times, and Tim Brown, the versatile Oakland star, and Cris Carter, the Minnesota Vikings touchdown savant, were six-time finalists. Michael Irvin, who trailed the others in terms of career statistics but was an important member of three Super Bowl-winning teams in Dallas, managed to overcome his own off-field issues to be elected in his third year on the ballot.While Owens will have to wait at least one more season, he will likely hope that the voters of the future can heed the advice of Newton to focus on the four to six seconds when the game is being played and ignore the rest. Because if this is about football, there is no question that Owens was one of the best to play the game."}

{"text": "To the Editor:Steven Rattners reminder that the disruptions to workers affected by free trade agreements create moral obligations for the country is spot on (Jobless in the Lions Den, Op-Ed, Jan. 26). The benefits of freer trade are significant for the country as a whole and especially for the corporate sector; so free trade is good. But the adverse effects of free trade are concentrated among displaced workers and small businesses.In approving more liberal trade policies, it is important that the country provide greater assistance to those adversely affected even if that means taxing or otherwise imposing costs on the primary direct beneficiaries of those trade policies.And even if we have the courage to act wisely on new trade proposals, we also need to acknowledge the obligations we have to people affected by liberalizations already in place.If we had a functioning government, perhaps some of this could be wrapped into major corporate tax reform.PAUL ZOSCHKEMinneapolis"}

{"text": "ROUND LAKE, N.Y.  Theres no question that Death Wish Coffee, a pirate-flag-adorned brand from upstate New York, is strong, like really strong, like linebacker-strong, like Super Bowl-hype strong, but is it the strongest coffee in the world?Yes? No? Yes? No? Yes? No? Dunno. (Note: The author of this article was highly caffeinated.)What is certain, however, is that Death Wish Coffee, like a halfback in an open field, is enjoying a remarkably lucky run since first hitting the market some three and a half years ago, with a warning label proclaiming it the Worlds Strongest Coffee.And while such a determination is probably better left to experts, Death Wish Coffees rabid fan base, including heavy-metal rockers and freezing-cold truckers, recently helped to land the company a prized advertisement spot during the Super Bowl broadcast on Sunday as part of a contest by Intuit, whose products help people balance their books and prepare their taxes (just like coffee).The contest invited businesses with fewer than 50 employees to enter to win the 30-second ad, winnowing thousands of contestants down to a final three (including another New York company, Vidlers, a five-and-dime near Buffalo). Death Wish was chosen by a public vote, presumably fueled by, you know, Death Wish.The ad, developed and produced by RPA, whose Super Bowl clients also include Honda, features a group of waterlogged Vikings jonesing for a cup of joe. The commercial, which will appear during the third quarter, has some of the skeleton staff at the Death Wish offices working 70-hour weeks in preparation for an onslaught of fatigued football and caffeine lovers looking to lift the Monday morning fog.Its almost like fans are more excited than we are, said Kane Grogan, the companys customer service manager. Were in the middle of it, so were more worried than anything.Fretting about filling huge orders, of course, is the kind of concern most small businesses would happily have, something acknowledged by the companys owner, Michael Brown, a former accountant who once worried about falling asleep at his desk at the State comptrollers office.Mr. Brown, 35, created the Death Wish brew in the basement of Saratoga Coffee Traders, a cafe he owned in nearby Saratoga Springs, after a group of apparently somnolent Saratogians decided they wanted a little more jolt in their java.Customers would come in asking for the strongest cup of coffee, Mr. Brown said in a phone interview from San Francisco, host to many of the Super Bowl festivities this year. And I wanted to mess with them a little bit.So it was that Mr. Brown decided to search out an especially strong mix of robusta and Arabica beans online and try it on customers, who he initially anticipated would be truck drivers, night-shift workers, doctors.To his surprise, however, the online buyers  it remains primarily an Internet brand, and not a cheap one  were more diverse. My moms friends from high school, like 75-, 80-year-olds, call me up saying this is my favorite coffee, Mr. Brown said.Mr. Browns big win, however, appears to have unleashed a regional rivalry with another, more established company  Deans Beans, in Orange, Mass.  which claims the idea, and some of the early beans, for Death Wish came from its signature brew, called Ahabs Revenge. Deans Beans strikes a similarly ominous tone in its marketing (Beware: contains the highest caffeine content of any organic coffee!).Dean Cycon, the founder of Deans Beans, said in an email that Death Wish had recreated our formula.Was anything they did illegal? Nope, he said. Was it unethical and deceptive? In my mind, yes.Mr. Brown said he had heard Mr. Cycons complaints, but had only compliments for Deans Beans. He has a great business model, Mr. Brown said, though he also noted that when my customers came in looking for a stronger cup of coffee, Deans Beans was already among the shops offerings.Regardless of such coffee clashes, Death Wish seems to have found its own niche, according to Mr. Grogan, who says it is popular with coders, gamers and other loners, as well as the occasional journalist.Like many who work at Death Wishs offices  housed in a bland warehouse off a country road  Mr. Grogan has several elaborate tattoos and a fondness for music. (I have four drummers on my staff, Mr. Brown said.) Theres a punching bag in the corner, and paintings sent in by fans, many of whom apparently cannot sleep.Indeed, even brewed at moderate strength, the coffees color falls somewhere between that of a dilated pupil and the far side of the moon. On a recent morning, a few sips brought an undeniable buzz to this reporters head, as well as what might be described as a kind of a pleasant arrhythmia. A single cup provided about 45 minutes of jittery high energy, followed by a sharp drop in enthusiasm for life and a sudden desire for another cup.Such ups and downs, of course, are the perils of working at Death Wish, Mr. Grogan said. It used to be kind of an all-day thing, he said, of his own intake. But it kind of wears off if you drink it too much."}
{"text": "Now that Mayor Bill de Blasio has unveiled a proposal to build a streetcar line along the East River in Brooklyn and Queens, the Trolley Man of Brooklyn would like to offer his services.The Trolley Man  otherwise known as Bob Diamond, an engineer and rail buff from Flatbush, Brooklyn  has spent decades trying to revive trolleys in his borough, and even began construction of a line before he was forced to abandon the project in 2003.Mr. Diamond, 56, said he was delighted to hear about the 16-mile line that Mr. de Blasio proposed. He wanted the mayor to know that he was available to help and could provide access to volumes of studies and plans related to rail construction that he said could save the city time.We even still have a rail car sitting on the tracks behind Fairway in Red Hook, Mr. Diamond said on Thursday, mentioning one of the Brooklyn neighborhoods that the proposed streetcar line would traverse. If the mayor want to use it, hes more than welcome. It has a beautiful paint job.The mayors $2.5 billion plan envisions a line that would wind through bustling and developing neighborhoods such as Astoria and Long Island City in Queens, and Greenpoint and Dumbo in Brooklyn, as well as Red Hook, where Mr. Diamonds group, the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association, had begun building a trolley line more than 20 years ago.Mr. Diamond is enamored of Brooklyns history with trolleys, which stretches back to horsecars in the early 1800s and cable cars in the middle part of that century. Electric trolleys became so plentiful that Brooklyns baseball team was named the Trolley Dodgers in the 1890s, before the name was shortened to the Dodgers.Mr. Diamonds trolley project began in the 1980s when he decided he wanted to build the first trolley line to run in Brooklyn since 1956, one that would link Red Hook to Downtown Brooklyn.Relying on public and private donors, Mr. Diamond built tracks on donated private property along the Red Hook shoreline. He restored old trolley cars and erected electric poles.Mr. Diamond got approvals and financing, bought 15 vintage street cars and installed 1,500 feet of track in Red Hook. But it all fell apart in 2003 when the city, he said, lost interest in his project, scrapped the plan and ripped up the tracks.His fleet of trolleys included one car from Norway, three Pullman cars from Boston that he bought for $9 total, a locomotive purchased from a New Jersey soybean farmer and a dozen cars from Ohio.My advice to the mayor is to create a structure that would survive his tenure in office, Mr. Diamond said. The problem with these projects is that eventually they hit an elected official who says, I wont get the credit, so why should I do it?Mr. Diamond also pointed out that in the early 20th century streetcars ran over all four bridges that cross the East River, a fact that made him consider the possibility of bringing streetcars back to Manhattan.On the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge, he said, there is an abandoned underground trolley terminal at Essex Street, and on the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge there is an old depot.Its funny, the thing hasnt even been built yet, and Im already thinking about expanding it, said Mr. Diamond, who became known for discovering a forgotten railroad tunnel, built before the Civil War beneath Atlantic Avenue, in 1979, when he was 19. He helped restore the tunnel and led tours for years before the city shut the tunnel in 2010, citing safety concerns.Maybe theres way I could fit into this, and be an adviser to the mayor, Mr. Diamond said of the new proposal.He said he could even draw a small salary.Give me a try for a couple weeks and see if I work, he said he would tell the mayors team. Then I can get my teeth fixed."}

{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Roughly 87 percent are white. About 58 percent are male. As many as two-thirds are at least 60 years old.As the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences scrambles to address an outcry over a lack of diversity among its membership, a close look of its largest group, the actors branch, shows that ending the imbalance within its ranks might be more difficult than, say, predicting the annual Oscar winners.The academy is typically reluctant to disclose the identities of its members and does not regularly provide demographic information about them. There is no set standard for membership and no consistency when it comes to how many people from the film industry are invited to join each year.But an examination by The New York Times of the actors branch  whose more than 1,100 members control acting nominations for the Academy Awards  revealed the basic racial outlines of the group. Using public and private databases, The Times compiled data on nearly 1,100 acting branch members. Along with the white members, about 6 percent are black, under 4 percent are Hispanic and less than 2 percent are Asian. Women make up about 42 percent of the branch. A spokeswoman for the academy confirmed all of those percentages.The academy has stated that its aim is to double the number of minorities in its overall membership by 2020. Yet, as it tries to remake itself by recruiting younger and more diverse members and jettisoning those no longer active in the business, it is confronting new challenges. There are protests that it is being unfair to older actors, worries that it could simply be creating different diversity issues in the future and criticism from those within its ranks who do not want to use categories like race, age or gender as any kind of organizing principle.Over the next five years, the academy would have to annually add about 14 black actors and at least nine actors who were either Asian or Hispanic to double the number of acting branch members in those ethnic groups. That would account for almost all of the slots if it invited 25 actors, which is how many were offered membership last year.To attain gender parity among actors in five years, the academy could more than triple the number of annual admissions, to 80, while adding three women for every man. Assuming a typical annual attrition rate of about 26 people (largely because of death), the branch membership would be about 51 percent women by 2020, but women would then far outnumber men among the younger members.There were 6,261 academy members throughout its various branches according to an annual tabulation it released on Dec. 14. Its official actors count  1,138 voters, plus 126 academy retirees, who do not vote  may have been trimmed by recent deaths like that of Abe Vigoda.Speaking by telephone this week, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academys president, said the more granular decisions about carrying out new diversity goals can be made only as various internal committees meet after the Feb. 28 Oscar ceremony.There will be a much more actionable process this year, Ms. Isaacs said of an annual self-assessment that in recent years has increasingly focused on broadening the membership.The academy is trimming its rolls, largely to limit voting rights to those who are active in the business. Last month, the academy said it would begin a year-round membership recruiting effort aimed at diversity, while also culling members who have not worked on a film for 10 years and have not been active during three separate decades since joining the academy. Anyone who has won or been nominated for an Oscar is excluded from those requirements.The overall goal, said Ms. Isaacs, is not to change voting patterns  those, she said, remain personal. Rather, it is to represent more of the working community, and also to become closer to the audience in general.Already, however, there has been negative reaction.This is not the way to go about things, Angie Dickinson, an actress who may be losing her vote under the new rules, said in an email. Ms. Dickinson, 84, whose career includes movies like the original Oceans 11 in 1960, added that she had sent an angry missive to the academy.My message to the academy was just this: I, Angie, voter, wrote them: I VOTE FOR PERFORMANCE . . . . NOT RACE.Academy members have long prided themselves on a membership process and voting choices based on excellence, a point that Ms. Isaacs stressed in her interview. Also, the groups acting branch, whatever its ethnic makeup, is highly varied, including Oscar winners as famous as Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks; actors like Richard Roundtree, perhaps best known for his role as the titular character in 1971s Shaft; and the comedian Russell Brand, who has appeared in movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall.While the percentage of black actors among last years invitees  three were invited, or roughly 12 percent  approached their share of the United States population, the percentage of women invited was much lower. Seven were invited, or 28 percent of the total, while women make up 51 percent of the population. The year before, six women were among the 20 actors invited, or 30 percent of the total. In some recent years, none of the invitees were Asian or Hispanic.Constant efforts have been and will continue to be made to seek out all qualified candidates, the academy spokeswoman said when asked about the number of actresses invited to join.It also appears that a reduction in the current voting members could result in more women losing their voting privileges than men, at least in the actors branch.Based on credits on the IMDbpro.com database, which tracks both previous work and films in process  but is not fully complete or without error  more women, about 150, than men, about 135, on the academy membership list examined by The Times appeared to be in a position where their active status might be examined by the academy. The spokeswoman for the academy disputed those numbers, saying they were substantially higher than the groups own preliminary assessment of members in jeopardy of losing their privileges. But even if the same number of men lost their active status as women, the female membership would be more affected because they already represent a smaller percentage of the academy.There has also been public support for the academys stated changes. I believe these new membership guidelines are taking us in the right direction, Margaret Avery, a black academy member and an Oscar nominee for her role in The Color Purple, wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.However, the academys new diversity program has been criticized for unfairly penalizing veteran actors. More than 65 percent of the acting members appear to have been born in 1955 or earlier, meaning they are at least 60 years old. Almost all of those who could potentially lose their voting status because of inactivity are in that group.I know they will affect my voting status, said Robert Hooks, 78, who is black and has acted in films like Passenger 57 and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, though he is now effectively retired from acting. You spend a life looking to work, then you get older, and its not there.Older actresses have long had a difficult time finding meaningful roles in the youth-focused entertainment industry. The number of studio releases has also dropped by about a third since 2006, further limiting opportunities. Whats important is to find more employment, Ms. Dickinson wrote. If Mr. Spielberg should call, Im ready to roll.Some older members have suggested that the academy give credit for service, including judging academy contests and sitting on academy panels. But the official guidelines disclosed by the academy last month made no mention of anything similar to that.Ms. Isaacs declined to discuss the status of any individual member.In the meantime, actors like Mr. Hooks are hoping further action will protect their academy status.Ive been a voter, Mr. Hooks said, and I dont plan to be anything but."}

{"text": "If some Americans had not registered just how brutal the Islamic State was before August 2014, the groups videotaped beheading of James Foley that month certainly drove the point home. Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance American journalist, became a symbol of sorts, evidence that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was an unscrupulous enemy that could not be ignored.Jim: The James Foley Story, a documentary airing Saturday night on HBO, seeks to reclaim the person at the center of this awful story, with friends, family members and fellow journalists speaking admiringly of Mr. Foley and leaving even those who never knew him with a sense of loss. The film is by Brian Oakes, a longtime friend of Mr. Foleys, so theres never much doubt about its intent, and it certainly paints Mr. Foley as a likable, intrepid fellow. But the film isnt interested in going much further, into lingering questions about the United States governments handling of hostage situations or the wisdom of the type of journalism Mr. Foley practiced.Mr. Foley was unusual in that he was taken prisoner once before, in Libya in 2011, and after his release soon went back into harms way. He was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 and ended up being held with a number of other prisoners, some of whom are interviewed in this film. Their descriptions of how they helped one another endure the long months of imprisonment  a game they made up, conversations they had  are the films most compelling moments.We invented a life during these months in captivity, says Nicolas Hnin, a French journalist who was held for 10 months. And when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family.The film, though, doesnt poke too deeply into why these former hostages are alive to tell the tale and Mr. Foley isnt. (There are many factors, including things like policies on paying ransom.) It also skirts the difficult subject of whether his efforts were worth the cost or are the best way, in the age of citizen journalism and cellphone cameras, to learn what is going on in lawless parts of the world.We see only brief glimpses of Mr. Foleys actual reports and are given no sense of whether, in the grand scheme of things, they were indispensable. Mr. Foley (in film clips) and colleagues he traveled with speak about the addictive adrenaline rush of going into danger zones and about how the people they reported on affected them personally. Yet there is no exploration of whether the old model of the fearless journalist chasing the story at any cost needs to be re-examined when groups like ISIS use captives as pawns.So expect to shed a tear for Mr. Foley and his family by the time this film is over. But also expect a lot of questions raised by his story to remain."}
{"text": "The extra life was a fixture of early video games, a reward for skilled players that was imbued with the language of reincarnation. Players would not say they earned additional time to play, or a bonus turn, upon reaching a certain score. They were bestowed an extra life, a new chance at existence.Death is not so frivolous in That Dragon, Cancer, a video game about Joel Green, a terminally ill 5-year-old, and his parents, Ryan and Amy. It is a game about a single life  one that ends and then is gone forever.The Greens, who live in Colorado, spent the past three years making the game with a small team of artists and designers. Ryan Green, who is a programmer, quit his job to work on the project. It is based on their own lives and that of Joel, who died while the game was in development.That Dragon, Cancer is not the first memoir to arrive in the form of a video game, but it is probably the most ambitious.I feel like That Dragon, Cancer is one of those breakthrough moments, said John Sharp, a professor of games at the New School and the author of Works of Game, a book about the intersection of games and art. I think we may look back at this game and see this as a touch point, a moment of rethinking what people can do with interactivity.That Dragon, Cancer mixes animation and magical realism to convey the Greens emotional state during Joels illness. There is one dragon, but much of the game consists of re-enactments of mundanities like phone messages and hospital visits. Water fills a room as a doctor says there are no more treatments for Joels cancer.The game also uses documentary audio  taken from home movies as well as from Thank You for Playing, a film about the Greens that had its premiere last year at the Tribeca Film Festival. Players hear Joels laughter, and they listen to the prayers that his parents, who are Christians, shouted on the last night of Joels life.The interactions offered to the players of That Dragon, Cancer are relatively limited. Players mostly click to decide which part of a vignette  feeding ducks at a pond or escorting Joel through a playground  will unfold, and when to move on to the next part of the Greens story.The restricted controls are intentional. A go-kart race through a hospital frustrated some critics, Mr. Green said, because the unwavering speed of the go-kart is dictated by the game. Thats the point, he said. All you can do is steer, hopefully.Withholding some control from the player was an attempt to convey feelings of helplessness and despair. One of the great strengths of video games is that automatically a player goes into a game expecting to have some agency, Mrs. Green said. And it felt like the perfect way to talk about cancer, because all a parent wants is to have some agency.Mr. Sharp, the New School professor, pointed to The Marriage, a 2006 game by Rod Humble, as a forerunner of the video game memoir. Yet The Marriage is an abstract, minimalist experience in which the ebb and flow of geometric shapes stand in for Mr. Humbles relationship with his wife.A closer antecedent may be Jason Rohrers Gravitation, released in 2008. The pixel art in Gravitation is playfully retro, but the representation is real. The player controls an avatar meant to resemble Mr. Rohrer, who can play catch with his son or  during bouts of creative mania  abandon him.Instead of just showing a character grappling with a difficult situation and seeing the choices a character makes, you can give the player a difficult situation and let them grapple with it themselves, Mr. Rohrer said of his game, which takes eight minutes to complete. It will be included in an exhibition of Mr. Rohrers work that opens this month at the Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.Mr. Rohrer and Mr. Sharp each mentioned dys4ia, a 2012 web browser game, as a landmark among video game memoirs. It is by Anna Anthropy and is about her decision to begin taking estrogen for hormone replacement therapy.Like That Dragon, Cancer  and unlike The Marriage and Gravitation  dys4ia feels like an interactive diary by its designer rather than a gamelike metaphor. It uses familiar tropes from video games, like shooting targets, negotiating mazes and moving blocks, to express Ms. Anthropys state of mind.More video game memoirs have come since, including Nina Freemans Freshman Year, about sexual harassment at a college bar, and a flood of interactive fiction written using the software Twine.Other games may allude to, or allegorize, the designers life story. The Legend of Zelda, the 1986 Nintendo game, is said to have been inspired by Shigeru Miyamotos youthful exploration of a cave northwest of Kyoto, Japan. Adr1ft, which will be released next month for the Oculus Rift, Facebooks virtual-reality headset, is an outer-space adventure inspired by its designers public shaming on Twitter. Unlike these games, a true video game memoir presents itself as nonfiction, even when it departs from the literal.Four years after the release of dys4ia, Ms. Anthropy said she feels that it has been interpreted simplistically as an empathy game that can give players the momentary sensation of what its like to be a transgender woman.Im wary of positioning these games as educational tools, instead of just as games that are working within this form to communicate something, she said. This idea that they have a purpose, they have a message and theres a takeaway, some neat little idea that you can walk away with, seems reductionist.Mr. Sharp of the New School compared the cultural status of games in the early 21st century to that of painting during the Italian Renaissance, when it began to shift from being a functional tool to a purely aesthetic form.It took hundreds of years to make this transition for painting, he said. So, looking at it through my art-historian goggles, its not really a surprise that there are folks who are outside the epicenter of the games community who make the assumption that if games arent escapist, they must be educational or therapeutic.Outsiders are not the only skeptics. Many of the most devoted video game players have resisted the expansion of the medium into new forms like memoir, said Vander Caballero, the designer of Papo & Yo, a 2012 PlayStation game about his relationship with his alcoholic father.In Papo & Yo, Mr. Caballeros father is represented as a monster who becomes violent when he eats frogs. Rather than defeating or curing the monster, players learn to live without him.We have proved that we can tell these stories through game design, Mr. Caballero said. But we havent proved that you can be profitable.Despite all the attention paid to That Dragon, Cancer  podcasts, magazine articles, a documentary film, millions of YouTube views of people playing it  the games sales in its first month have been modest, the Greens said.About 10,000 people have bought it, according to the website SteamSpy. Thats a nice number for a work of creative nonfiction that arrives inside a dust jacket, but not for a three-year software project with eight people working on it.Gravitation, which is free, has been downloaded nearly 80,000 times since 2008, Mr. Rohrer said. The page that hosted Ms. Anthropys dys4ia when it was free has been viewed more than 600,000 times. Since she started asking $5 for it a little more than a year ago, more than 500 people have bought it.By comparison, almost four million people own Grand Theft Auto V on Steam, the primary digital storefront for PC games, according to SteamSpy.I always tell people, You know those indie, artsy films that Ryan likes and no one else likes? Mrs. Green said. There are video games like that."}
{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  After Malaysias attorney general cleared Prime Minister Najib Razak of corruption charges involving hundreds of millions of dollars that ended up in his bank accounts, Mr. Najib issued a statement of his own.The matter has been comprehensively put to rest, he said last week. It is time for us to unite and move on.That has not happened.Instead of answering the questions about the money and its possible links to a heavily indebted Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, the attorney generals announcement has only sharpened them.Its not logical at all, said Azral Shah, 28, a computer network analyst taking a cigarette break outside a Kuala Lumpur high-rise this week. Im not sure what is the true story, but most of the nation doesnt think that what they are telling us is true.The attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, said the largest sum in question, $681 million, was a personal donation from the Saudi royal family, most of which  $620 million  was later returned because it was not used.But his statement has been overshadowed by fresh doubts, from Malaysia to Saudi Arabia.There is no clear explanation as to how this huge sum of money was moved into Najibs accounts, the banks used by these Arabs, the sources of the fund, the business of the donor, Mahathir Mohamad, a former Malaysian prime minister who has become one of Mr. Najibs harshest critics, wrote on his blog.In Saudi Arabia, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that he accepted the attorney generals opinion that there had been no wrongdoing, but he also said that he did not think that the money had come from the Saudi government or that it was a political donation.It is a private Saudi citizen, I believe, and the funds went to an investment in Malaysia, he said in an interview on Thursday.One member of the royal family and one associate of the family, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the money had come from a Saudi prince and confirmed that it was not a donation. The associate questioned the reported sum but said the funds were part of a business deal.The attorney generals decision shut down an investigation by Malaysias anticorruption commission, leading the panel to seek a review of the ruling, and the countrys former law minister filed suit to reverse it.The decision has not stopped international inquiries. Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States are investigating transactions involving the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Mr. Najib set up the fund and is the chairman of its advisory board.The Swiss attorney generals office said on Friday that its investigation had found serious evidence that suggested that $4 billion had been misappropriated from Malaysian state-owned companies. Some of that money was transferred into bank accounts of former Malaysian officials and former and current officials from the United Arab Emirates, the Swiss authorities say.The announcement said the Swiss were looking into several business deals between United Arab Emirates state-owned companies and 1MDB, as well as allegations involving a small oil company called PetroSaudi that carried out a joint venture with 1MDB.On Monday, Singapore said it had seized a large number of bank accounts in connection with the investigations.Opposition politicians in Malaysia have demanded that Mr. Apandi, the attorney general, prove that 1MDB was not used as Mr. Najibs political slush fund.The question for Mr. Apandi was how did he satisfy himself that, even if the funds deposited into the prime ministers personal bank accounts came from the mysterious Arab donor, the money did not originate from 1MDB? said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament from the Democratic Action Party.Mr. Apandi, appointed by Mr. Najib in the summer, has declined to answer questions or release details of his investigation. I stand by my decision, he said by text message. No further comment.Nor has Mr. Najib publicly explained the money, though he has said that he had done nothing wrong and took no money for personal gain. The Swiss attorney generals office said he was not one of the officials identified in their investigation.Mr. Apandi has said that his office will cooperate with the Swiss inquiry, though some Malaysian officials complained that the Swiss announcement could strain bilateral ties and create bias in the news media. 1MDB says that it has not been contacted by foreign legal authorities, but it would cooperate with any investigation.But if Mr. Apandis version of events is true, that raises other troubling questions.A political donation of $681 million, equal to about 2.6 billion Malaysian ringgit, would be an exorbitant sum in Malaysian politics. An American presidential campaign costs about $1 billion. Malaysia has less than a tenth the population of the United States.Such a large donation would not necessarily be illegal. Malaysian law restricts candidates for Parliament to about $50,000 a campaign, but there are no limits on spending by political parties or curbs on overseas funding.If the donation was aboveboard, it may have taken a circuitous route. Malaysian investigators said the $681 million was transferred to Mr. Najibs accounts in two deposits from a British Virgin Islands-registered company through a Swiss bank owned by an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, according to published reports.The funds arrived in 2013, when Mr. Najibs party, which has led Malaysia since its independence from Britain in 1957, faced a powerful election challenge. What some analysts have described as an orgy of campaign spending helped the party win a tight race.Members of Mr. Najibs cabinet have previously described the funds as political donations, and at least one prominent party member has acknowledged receiving funds from Mr. Najib.By the very fact that his party members have admitted they got a lot of money from the prime minister to run their campaigns, its an admission that they are privy to sources of funding, which they have not disclosed, said Terence Gomez, a professor at the University of Malaya who researches money in the nations politics. Now its been exposed, and we find out that a foreign country is supporting the prime minister and the party.At the same time, the attorney general suggested that Mr. Najib did not need $681 million for the election since he returned most of it. Mr. Apandi did not say how, when or to whom the money was returned, nor what Mr. Najib did with the remaining $61 million.In his news conference, the attorney general also addressed another deposit in Mr. Najibs account, about $13 million that was transferred from SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB now owned by the Finance Ministry, which Mr. Najib controls. Mr. Apandi said that there was no evidence Mr. Najib had any knowledge of the deposit.Mr. Najib has not commented on the transaction.Mr. Apandi raised more questions after he briefly waved a copy of his investigative report before reporters. Cameras flashed, photographs were scrutinized, and it appeared that an additional $8 million from SRC flowed into one of Mr. Najibs accounts in 2014.Neither the attorney general nor Mr. Najib have explained that transaction.Theyve stopped caring about whether the story makes any sense, said Ambiga Sreenevasan, a lawyer and former president of the Malaysian Bar Council. They just want the image of closure.Despite public concerns, Mr. Najib seems to have consolidated his position, last year dismissing a deputy prime minister who raised questions about the 1MDB scandal. Likewise, Mukhriz Mahathir, the son of Mr. Mahathir and a leading critic of Mr. Najib, was ousted on Wednesday as the top official of a federal state, in what he called retribution for publicly criticizing Mr. Najib.But the slowing economy, the low price of oil and a recently introduced tax on goods and services as well as the continuing 1MDB scandal have dampened broader public support, said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency in Malaysia. Mr. Najib is likely to face a tough challenge to retain his position in elections expected in 2018."}
{"text": "Before the jury entered a courtroom in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Friday, prosecutors and defense lawyers at the trial of Peter Liang, a police officer whose gunshot killed an unarmed man in the stairwell of a housing project, approached the judge.At issue were events that had taken place in another part of New York City: The night before, two officers, Diara E. Cruz and Patrick Espeut, were shot in a housing project in the Bronx. They were performing the same type of stairwell patrol Officer Liang was conducting in Brooklyn on Nov. 20, 2014, when he fired his gun and a bullet bounced off a wall and killed Akai Gurley, 28, who was walking down the stairs with his girlfriend. Like Officer Liang and his partner, Shaun Landau, the officers shot on Thursday were still relatively new to the job.We had one primary concern: Its that the defense not be allowed to refer to last nights shooting in any way in any question during the trial, Joe Alexis, an assistant Brooklyn district attorney, told Justice Danny K. Chun.Officer Liang, charged with manslaughter and other offenses, entered the stairwell of the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York with his 9-millimeter Glock pistol drawn. Prosecutors have spent much of the two-week trial arguing that unholstering his weapon was unwarranted and reckless in a place filled with residents going about their lives.The events of Thursday night, in which the officers were shot by a man they encountered during what is known as a vertical patrol in the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx, seem to underscore the Police Departments view that housing project stairwells can be perilous places to patrol.Officer Liangs defense has insisted on the danger of such spaces throughout the trial.But, Mr. Alexis told the judge, That tragic shooting is much different than what happened here.Robert E. Brown, a lawyer for Officer Liang, who had worked on the police force for only about 18 months at the time of the shooting, disagreed.Looking at the screen of his cellphone, Mr. Brown read remarks made by Mayor Bill de Blasio after the Bronx shooting. Its another example of what our officers confront every single day, Mr. Brown said, quoting the mayor, keeping us safe not only in the streets of New York City, but in the stairwells and the hallways of our public housing developments.Mr. Brown finished quoting the mayor, put the phone down and continued: What happened last night in the Bronx is remarkably similar to the setup to this case: Two rookie police officers, theyre doing a vertical patrol, theyre ambushed.He asked Justice Chun to sequester the jury for the duration of the trial, preventing them from reading, watching or discussing any news. The judge declined. Instead, he said he would caution the jury not to read any news coverage about Officer Liangs case.I think we have a smart jury, the judge said.As the trial finished for the day, Justice Chun sternly warned jurors to avoid reading not only coverage of Officer Liangs trial, but also any articles that might even mention the case.On Friday, the defense produced its last witnesses before Officer Liang takes the stand, which he is scheduled to do on Monday. They included a weapons expert, a former police lieutenant and a private investigator, Daniel Reefer, whom the defense had hired to stake out the stairwell where Mr. Gurley was killed.Mr. Reefer said he visited twice last month, spending an hour each time. He positioned himself on the eight-floor landing and videotaped foot traffic. There were zero pedestrians going up or down the stairs on either visit, he said.When it was time for Marc Fliedner, an assistant district attorney, to question Mr. Reefer, he asked if perhaps no one took the stairs because of what had happened there to Mr. Gurley.Before Mr. Reefer could respond, the defense objected, and the judge sustained it."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The contrast between the improving health of the labor market and the weakness of other economic indicators poses a challenging quandary for the Federal Reserve.Janet L. Yellen, the Feds chairwoman, and other officials have said the Fed must raise its benchmark interest rate as job growth continues to prevent higher inflation down the road. The strength of the January jobs report  including faster wage growth  suggests the Feds policy-making committee still could raise rates as soon at its next meeting in March.But the Fed would be betting on a theory. Inflation remains low, growth has slowed and the impact of global economic problems and financial market volatility is unclear. If the Fed presses ahead, it could undermine the economy just as things are getting good for the vast majority of Americans.My message to the Fed regarding this recent, long-awaited acceleration in wages is Love it and leave it alone, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who previously served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. If we want working people to benefit from the expansion, the last thing youd want to do is tap the brakes  especially given the absence of inflationary pressures.The Fed raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis. It had held rates near zero for seven years to encourage borrowing and risk-taking. Ms. Yellen, speaking after the announcement, said the Fed planned to raise rates gradually, reducing those incentives because the economy no longer needed quite as much help.She will speak publicly for the first time since then on Wednesday when she testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. In the intervening two months, the economic outlook has deteriorated. Financial conditions have tightened and the dollar has gained strength, weighing on American exporters and delaying any rebound in inflation.The January jobs report, however, reflects considerable strength in other parts of the economy. Stronger wage growth is particularly likely to grab the Feds attention, suggesting that employers are finally being forced to compete for workers by raising pay. In a high-profile example, Walmart, the nations largest private employer, has said that it plans to increase hourly pay rates for most of its employees later this month.The Fed is less likely to worry about the slower pace of job creation in January, as officials have predicted that slower population growth would weigh on job creation. In keeping with those expectations, the unemployment rate still fell to 4.9 percent.One reason the Fed is focused on job growth is that it may be a more accurate reflection of the strength of the underlying economy. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for example, the government estimated the economy added 279,000 jobs a month, but that output increased at a rate of just 0.7 percent.Jason Furman, chairman of the presidents Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in an analysis on Friday that the output figures probably reflected some measurement error. This illustrates the importance of focusing on a wide range of indicators  especially labor market data, which tend to be less noisy  in assessing the health of the economy, he said.One wing of the Fed sees an undiminished case for raising rates.Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and one of the 10 Fed officials voting on the direction of policy this year, said this week that the Fed should continue the gradual adjustment of moving rates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation.She also played down concerns about the economic impact of recent market volatility. While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted, she said, monetary policy cannot respond to every blip in financial markets.Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and another voter, said on Thursday in New York that it was premature to change her economic outlook.At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy growth in real disposable income, suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound, Ms. Mester said. Until we see further evidence to the contrary, my expectation is that the U.S. economy will work through the latest episode of market turbulence and soft patch to regain its footing for moderate growth.Other Fed officials, however, say the volatility has given them pause.William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a close adviser to Ms. Yellen, said in an interview with Market News International this week that he was worried about the economic impact of jittery markets.If those financial conditions were to remain in place by the time we get to the March meeting, we would have to take that into consideration in terms of that monetary policy decision, Mr. Dudley said.And Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been particularly outspoken in warning that global pressures will weigh on domestic growth, told The Wall Street Journal this week that recent developments reinforce the case for watchful waiting.Investors, oddly, have walked away from this debate feeling confident that the Fed will not raise rates in March. Indeed, asset prices tied to expectations about the future level of short-term interest imply only about a 50 percent chance of any rate increase this year.That contrasts sharply with the Feds own prediction in December that it planned to raise rates by about one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four discrete steps.Many analysts have taken a more measured position, predicting that the Fed is less likely to move in March, but that it will still raise rates two or three times this year.Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said on Friday he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, instead of three times, and to start in June, instead of March.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the continuation of low inflation probably meant Fed policy makers would hesitate at their next session.Were the meeting held tomorrow, we still think the Fed would stay on hold  primarily because of concerns about inflation and inflation expectations, he said. But it would be an uncomfortable hold."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Everybodys a Critic (news analysis, Sunday Review, Jan. 31):Our new work puts to the test A. O. Scotts contention that everyone is a critic. When we embarked on our research project, we had the same gut feeling as Mr. Scott, who laments that the inflated, always suspect authority of ink-stained wretches like me has been leveled by digital anarchy.There are also studies (by other scholars) that highlight the importance of user reviews, and show that consumers and experts use different criteria in forming their opinions. But we were surprised to find that the rumors of critics demise were greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain.Our earlier work, published in The Journal of Marketing using data from the 1990s, shows that the opinion of professional critics was an important determinant of the financial success of films. In our new work, we compare the influence of user reviews to the effect of professional critics on box office revenues.We are using the latest statistical methodologies, and exploring 21st-century data.But critics still win, hands down. It seems that moviegoers place much more weight on the views of Mr. Scott and his colleagues when deciding which movie to see than on the opinions of super audience reviewers of various varieties that are available on websites. To use Mr. Scotts analogy, his group of soldiers in the culture wars (critics) seems to be winning the battle, at least for the time being.S.

{"text": "When Tyronn Lue took over as the coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers last month, he raised eyebrows by questioning the conditioning of his players and openly wondering if they could keep up with his vision for the team.We just havent been accustomed to playing that way, Lue told reporters of the faster pace he tried to coax out of the Cavaliers in his first game, which the team lost to the Chicago Bulls. So something new. I have to do a better job to get us in better shape.LeBron James, while disputing reports that he helped push the previous coach, David Blatt, out the door, was either involved in Lues decision to change the teams style or was trying to support him because he did not challenge the assertion that the team was out of shape.James recently told reporters: We need to start doing stuff on off days, doing stuff at practice, during shootarounds, getting up and down the floor, getting our heart rate going, because he wants to play faster.While the nine games the Cavaliers have played under Lue are a relatively small sample, the team has increased its scoring. But a closer look at the numbers reveals that the transition from Blatt to Lue has not exactly been a paradigm shift in style for the slow-footed franchise.Under Lue, the Cavaliers had averaged 94.6 possessions per 48 minutes heading into the weekend, a mark below the 95.1 they averaged under Blatt and a pace slower than all but two teams in the N.B.A. this season. While pace is partly dictated by the style of a teams opponent, the notion that the Cavaliers could immediately develop into a ball-movement team proved false. They have shot slightly better, but otherwise, little has changed.In Wednesdays loss to the Charlotte Hornets, the ball-movement offense that Lue wants was nowhere to be found as Kyrie Irving and James seemed more interested in trying to dig the Cavaliers out of a hole using isolation plays. The disjointed style was not helped by a third quarter in which the team shot 7 of 23. Perhaps more important, Cleveland was badly dominated on the boards during the game, to the tune of a 49-28 rebounding disadvantage, despite having three rotation regulars who are strong rebounders in Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love and James.It has not all been bad. Consecutive losses to Charlotte and Boston came on the heels of a five-game winning streak that included a 14-point victory over the San Antonio Spurs, who have the second-best record in the league, behind the Golden State Warriors.The biggest change has seemed to come in the play of the 6-foot-10 Love, who struggled to find his place under Blatt. Love has increased his scoring and reduced his turnovers playing for Lue, looking more engaged than he had since the trade that sent him to Cleveland from the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2014. He left Fridays loss with a bruised thigh and sat out Saturday nights 99-84 win over the New Orleans Pelicans but hoped to return soon.In truth, given the type of change Lue is trying to put into effect, the team will probably be tinkering until the start of the postseason. And despite the turmoil of the coaching change and a shift in approach, the Cavaliers have a two-game lead over the Toronto Raptors for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, giving them plenty of time to sort things out.Still, if they want to do more than just talk about running, Lue will need to persuade Irving and James to play his way even when the team is behind. That may be a hard sell."}
{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon   Syrian government and allied forces pressed their most significant advance in months on Friday, sending insurgents scrambling and tens of thousands of civilians fleeing toward the border with Turkey.The advance has accelerated in recent days, with new momentum from heavy Russian airstrikes in the northern province of Aleppo, according to Syrian state news media, residents and antigovernment activists. The governments gains have given a morale boost to loyalists and prompted opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, to calculate their next moves.The governments gains in Aleppo Province, building on earlier ones in Daraa in the south and Latakia in the north, also scuttled United Nations-mediated peace talks this week in Geneva. Neither side saw much to discuss there: The government believed it was achieving its goals on the battlefield, while the opposition accused the Assad administration and Russia of using negotiations as a cover for indiscriminate attacks.Russias four months of escalating military intervention have strengthened the government, allowing Mr. Assads forces to go on the offensive in several provinces at once for the first time in years. It remains to be seen whether the most recent advances will hold. But they have dealt major blows to the armed opposition and made crucial military gains around the divided city of Aleppo, the provincial capital that was once Syrias largest city and industrial hub.Government forces and pro-government militias, including the Lebanese group Hezbollah, have cut the main supply route for weapons and humanitarian aid north of the city. If the government and its allies advance farther south, they could surround rebels in Aleppo and employ the type of starve or surrender siege the government has used elsewhere.Mr. Assads forces also broke the insurgents siege of two towns near Aleppo, Nubol and Zahra, which had survived on government airdrops of food. People there were celebrating on Friday and thanking the troops in videos posted on social media.The government gains have increased the sense of alarm among antigovernment insurgents and their civilian supporters, sending thousands of people, including women and children with whatever they can carry, fleeing through orchards.In one video posted on social media, a woman can be heard calling out: Russia is bombing us, Iran is bombing us, Daesh  another name for the Islamic State  is bombing us. Where should we go?A man who said he was from Homs Province, several hundred miles to the south, said he had fled to one town after another in Aleppo Province, always chased by bombardments and shelling. They killed my mother. They killed my father. They killed my brother, he said. Where are the Arabs? Where is Islam?The United Nations said 20,000 people were stuck at the border fence between Syria and Turkey, and aid groups said as many as 50,000 were expected. Turkish officials have said they will allow refugees to cross, but it was not clear when they would open the crossing or how many would be allowed through. A few people requiring urgent medical care are being taken to Turkish hospitals.The United Nations director of humanitarian operations, John Ging, told the Security Council on Friday that the situation around Aleppo, and the closing of an important border crossing with Turkey, could prevent food and medicine from reaching 325,000 people caught in the fighting, according to two diplomats who attended the closed meeting.Opponents of Mr. Assad from the area under attack expressed anguish that the government advances had continued while talks were set to take place in Geneva. Yaser al-Hajj, an activist who has often helped foreign journalists in Aleppo, left the talks before they were halted when he heard of the intensifying attacks not far from his hometown, Marea.I cannot stay here, he said at the airport in Geneva before he left. Why is the United States letting this happen? They are letting Russia do whatever it wants. This will help the terrorists.Mr. Hajj was referring to fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which he said would benefit from the losses suffered by rival insurgents. Russia has said it sees no distinction between the Islamic State and other insurgent groups.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the Obama administration was deeply concerned about the worsening humanitarian crisis in Aleppo.Theres the possibility that government forces backed by the Russians would encircle that city and essentially lay siege to that city, and that would obviously exacerbate a terrible humanitarian situation there, Mr. Earnest said.He also said Russias intensifying military campaign to support the Syrian government was delaying a political resolution to the war because it gives the Assad regime less of an incentive to come to the negotiating table and act constructively in conversations there.After the Security Council meeting, the French ambassador, Franois Delattre, criticized Russia for its bombardments and said the Syrian opposition could not be expected to negotiate with a gun to their head. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, responded that a broader cease-fire would be required. We cannot stop this unilaterally, he said.The new advances are squeezing rebel groups north of Aleppo that have been holding off Islamic State militants, who want to expand into a coveted section of rebel-held territory near the Turkish border. Long controlled by United States-backed insurgents and hard-line Islamists, that strip of land is wanted by nearly every party to the conflict.Kurdish militias want the area to connect two enclaves they control near the border to the east and west. That is where the United States and Turkey sought last year to create a safe zone for refugees, free of Islamic State fighters. That plan broke down when the two countries, NATO allies, disagreed on the details.Turkey would be particularly troubled if the Kurds, whom it considers its main enemy in the area, further encroached on the border area.It would be unusual, though, for Turkey to send in troops without consulting with the United States, even though their relationship has been strained by Turkeys frustration that the United States is more focused on battling the Islamic State than Mr. Assad.A Saudi official said on Wednesday that the kingdom would consider sending troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State, but it appeared he had spoken without consulting with regional allies, and it was not clear what kind of deployment he meant or where it would be.In neighboring Idlib Province, west of Aleppo, insurgents were on alert for shortages and price increases because of the cut in the Aleppo supply road, according to an antigovernment activist in the area.Today, I wanted to buy salt, said the activist, Mohammad Moataz. The guy told me: Starting the middle of this month, no more salt. No cars are coming from Aleppo. The bakers couldnt find salt for their bakeries.The blockade on the road will most likely force cargo to be rerouted through Idlib Province, where the territory around the border crossing with Turkey is controlled by the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. That will probably give the jihadists greater leverage over other rebel groups, wrote Columb Strack, a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk.Airstrikes and bombardments in the area may indicate that government forces plan on pressing south to cut the Idlib road as well and surround Aleppo.This would provide the government with substantial leverage to eventually negotiate over the future of the city from a position of strength, Mr. Strack wrote, adding that residents of Aleppo would probably face a humanitarian crisis, as already seen in other besieged towns such as Madaya, but on a much larger scale."}
{"text": "On the day before my mother died, she gave my father a list of demands.  He wrote them on the back of an envelope and showed them to me as he left the intensive care unit.  There, in his clear block handwriting, it read:CREAMWHISKEYHEROINMy mother was not herself.  And yet, she was completely herself. When Moms liver stopped working, her brain, which we had always considered loopy, grew addled.  But she was still funny.  She hallucinated monkeys on unicycles circling her bed.  She learned that Michael Jackson had died, probably from all that plastic surgery, she said. She remembered Sarah Palin, and thought she was a twit.Mom died, at 67, in 2009, but lately Ive been reflecting on her last days. Im applying to medical school, and her story keeps coming up in my essays and interviews. Her death spurred me to apply, partly because it gave me courage  nothing in med school could be worse than watching the way my mother died.  Her death was so grisly that I vowed to help change the way people die in America.Mom had a chronic liver condition, an autoimmune disease that had been under control for years but suddenly worsened.  After her liver failed, her kidneys followed, then her lungs.  After four months in the I.C.U. she was on 24-hour dialysis, with a breathing tube down her throat and a feeding tube up her nose.  She hated all the tubes; her hands were tied to the bed so she couldnt pull them out.She needed a liver transplant, but was too sick to survive one. Then a fungal infection invaded her lungs, dodged the antibiotics and spread through her body.  On a Friday afternoon in August, our family met with the doctors. If we left Mom on life support, the fungus would eat her alive, putrefying her innards, turning her fingers black.  It would be a cruel death, they said.Its already been a cruel death, I thought.We decided to let Mom go.And so there we were, standing at the edge of my mothers life. After the nurse removed the tubes and machines, we gathered around the hospital bed.  The doctors didnt know how long she could live without life support  somewhere between 15 minutes and a week.  We didnt tell her she was dying, but she understood.  A nurse for 28 years, she knew the game was up.  But she was happy, thrilled to be off the ventilator.  She talked, made jokes, greedily sucked on mouth swabs soaked in ginger ale.  The television played soft piano music and looped pictures of sunsets and mountains, birds and flowers.  The C.A.R.E. channel, it was called  continuous ambient relaxation environment.  That was good for some laughs.  Maybe this wont be so bad, I thought.It got dark.  Most of the family went out for a break, leaving my brother, uncle and me with Mom. Moments later, her face crumpled into despair.  As we held her hands, she sobbed silently, turning her head from side to side.  She didnt speak.  She just wept.She wept for fear of death, for the betrayal of her body, for the hopelessness of it all.  She wept for the places she would never visit, the retirement she never had.  She wept for her only grandchild  my son  who would not remember her, for the second grandchild in my pregnant belly whom she would never meet.I have never seen such anguish.  I have never felt so helpless.  My stomach churned in panic. I had no experience with death, or consoling the dying.  The only person I knew how to comfort was my 18-month-old son.Do you want to hear a song?  I asked.\nMy mother, crying silently, nodded yes.\nHeres one that Finny likes.I took a breath and blurted it out:Three little speckled frogs\nSitting on a speckled log\nEating the most delicious bugs \nYum! Yum!\nOne jumped into the pool,\nWhere it was nice and cool,\nNow there are two speckled frogs!I danced around the darkened hospital room. Blub blub!  Mom rolled her eyes.By the next evening Mom was on a steady morphine drip, drifting in and out of consciousness.   She slept fitfully, her hands fluttering toward her face, touching her forehead, then resting on her chest.  Occasionally she opened her eyes and stared at her hands uncomprehendingly.  They were knobbed with arthritis, yellowed with jaundice; already the hands of a corpse.When she woke up, my sister and I went to the bed.  Hi Mom, I said.  Are you in pain?She squinted at me, then rolled her eyes.  Why are you still here? she asked.  Youre crazy!   Watch out, I warned, or Ill sing the frog song again.  She smiled and fell asleep.My mothers room, on a top floor of a major university teaching hospital near Boston, had a large picture window.  Through it, I could see the roof of the building next door, and beyond that the lake where my sister and I had learned to sail.  On the rooftop an orange windsock swelled in the breeze.  It was illuminated somehow, and strangely beautiful. I sat next to the window, dozing.I dreamed about Ted Kennedy.  He had died a few days earlier, and his memorial services had blanketed the Boston news. I was jealous of Kennedy.  He spent his last days at home, smelling the salt of the ocean.  He ate bowls of butter crunch ice cream, watched James Bond movies and shared dinner with friends.Im sure Kennedys death had its share of horror, but that didnt curb my envy. Teddy got ice cream; my mom got a sterile sponge soaked in warm ginger ale.  Ted got the ocean; Mom got a gritty rooftop with a windsock.  Ted got his own bed and movies; Mom got the blinking lights of the I.C.U. and the stupid C.A.R.E. channel.  Her TV didnt even have good reception.She did not regain consciousness, and died the next morning. I made peace with her death, but not with her dying. She had four months in the I.C.U., endless and pointless and painful procedures, and final days full of fear and despair.  Why is this medicines default death for so many people?Now, seven years later, as I apply for medical school, the question comes up again and again.  I suppose I should have devised some pat answers by now, prepared my bullet points. But I havent.My mothers brutal death exposes so many flaws in American medicine: our lack of palliative care, our unwillingness to face end-of-life decisions, our inability to stop the procedures and just let go.  Her death was a system failure, and as a doctor I dont know how I alone can fix the system.  I know only that I will try.Barbara Moran is a science writer in Brookline, Mass.

The United States supports these efforts.

{"text": "Here are five notable quotes from Mayor Bill de Blasios State of the City address on Thursday, with explanations of their significance.Today we take the next great step in connecting New Yorkers to the heart of our new economy for New York.The speech was filled with proposals large and small, with little in common other than that the city could undertake them largely on its own, without input or assistance from Albany.The city, for example, would pay the $2.5 billion cost of a proposed streetcar system that would join Brooklyn and Queens along the East River waterfront. The city, rather than the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is state-run, would also operate the line. Likewise, a proposed development that would make Governors Island a year-round hub for attracting new businesses would focus on the 150 acres that are under city control.Different as our lives are, we are bound together by an invisible thread. We are united by the profound and powerful fact that we are all New Yorkers.If there was a dominant theme, it was that the city draws its strength from its polyglot nature, the diversity of its enclaves and neighborhoods.It was not the sort of overarching message that supports a single policy proposal, but rather a thread the mayor wove through a litany of initiatives, from doing more to clean up graffiti to making rooftop repairs in public housing complexes to using countdown clocks to track the progress of buses through the streets.For the first time, as a city, we are fighting to shatter that stigma and deal with the public health crisis of mental health.The mayor mentioned mental health or mental illness roughly a dozen times. The issue is expected to be a major priority for him this year, and his wife, Chirlane McCray, will continue to be a driving force in the related initiatives.Mr. de Blasio said the program his wife is to lead would include establishing a hotline for people in crisis, and offering mental health first-aid training for New Yorkers so they are able to identify and respond to signs of mental illness and substance abuse. The mayor blew a kiss to Ms. McCray when he introduced her.Everything were doing to make this a fairer city, a city of opportunity, rests on the work we do to keep people safe.The address included several minutes of praise for the work of uniformed members of the citys police, fire and correction departments, on and off the job. Members of the audience rose in applause as the mayor introduced Police Officer Kenneth Healey, who survived being struck in the head by a hatchet-wielding attacker in 2014.The praise seemed meant to underscore how far Mr. de Blasio has gone to try to repair his relations with the Police Department, which became badly strained after two officers were shot and killed in the line of duty in December 2014.Even as the mayor spoke, two officers were shot in the South Bronx; both were expected to survive. After the speech was over, Mr. de Blasio was told of the shooting, left the stage and went immediately to the hospital where they had been taken. Once there, he addressed reporters while standing alongside Patrick J. Lynch, the Patrolmens Benevolent Association president who had been a vocal antagonist of the mayors last year.We call these speeches the State of the City. To me, that really means the State of Our People. Because its the 8.5 million of us, living in neighborhoods across the five boroughs, that make this the greatest city in the world.Throughout the speech, the mayor played municipal booster. Two times he called New York the greatest city in the world; he did not use the phrase at all in his two previous State of the City addresses.The sentiment appeared to be in keeping with the absence of sweeping new initiatives and highlighted a message  one that is likely to be repeated frequently in the second half of Mr. de Blasios term as the 2017 election approaches  that life in New York has improved on his watch."}
{"text": "Spotlight, considered an Oscar front-runner, follows The Boston Globe expos of the Roman Catholic Churchs cover-up of sexual abuse by priests. And on Thursday the film was finally shown to figures at the heart of the story: it was privately screened for a Vatican commission entrusted with investigating that abuse.The screening, described in The Los Angeles Times as extraordinary, preceded a three-day meeting of the commission. That panel was created by Pope Francis, but he was reportedly not at the showing.Last year, after the film played at the Venice Film Festival, Deadline.com quoted Mark Ruffalo, who plays one of the Boston Globe journalists, as saying that he and the rest of the Spotlight team were hoping that the pope and the Vatican use this very, very sober and judicious story to begin to heal the wounds that the church also received.Vatican Radio commented on the film at the time, calling it honest and compelling, and praising the director, Tom McCarthy, for avoiding scandal-mongering. The outlet also noted that the church had nothing to fear from the film.The development might nudge Spotlight ahead in this years tight Oscar race. It certainly underscores the films heft beyond a mere awards race, and naming it best picture might make the beleaguered Academy look good. The only thing that could trump this turn would be Wall Street indictments prompted by The Big Short, and we all know how likely that is."}
{"text": "Political pundits and Republican leaders like to say that nobody could have foreseen the extraordinary rise of Donald J. Trumps presidential candidacy.But there were early signs that the electorate was ready for an insurgency like the one Mr. Trump has inspired this election. And some of the most powerful of those indicators came from New Hampshire.In 2014, Scott Brown, a Republican and former Massachusetts senator who was running for a Senate seat in New Hampshire, aired an ad that seemed a curious fit for the state: As ominous music played in the background, and scenes of southern border crossings flashed on the screen, Mr. Brown described an immigration crisis sweeping the country.Americans go through security before they get on a plane, enter a government building or attend a ballgame, Mr. Brown said. But folks who come here illegally? They just walk across the border. Thats wrong.The advertising message from Mr. Brown seemed surprising for several reasons. It collided with national Republican leaders moves to temper the partys views on immigration after the 2012 election. And it was aired in nearly all-white New Hampshire, some 2,000 miles from Mexico.Even so, it had a powerful impact, helping Mr. Brown survive a crowded primary and make the race with the incumbent senator, Jeanne Shaheen, competitive. It also prodded Ms. Shaheen to distance herself from President Obamas planned executive orders on immigration.Scott did something that the national party was actually arguing against, said Eric Fehrnstrom, a consultant for Mr. Brown in that race. It worked for him.Mr. Brown narrowly lost that contest, 51 percent to 49, but his campaign recognized something that the national party seemed for months to miss: The partys base was deeply angry, and white working-class voters, like those in New Hampshire, felt neglected by and alienated from the political system.That message was ripe for Mr. Trump to come in and run with it, said David N. Bossie, the president of the conservative group Citizens United. And, with Mr. Trumps combination of celebrity and command of a media microphone, Mr. Bossie said, he is the perfect person to capitalize on it.Mr. Trump has emerged as the champion of those voters who feel neglected, in large part by viscerally amplifying Mr. Browns message that the borders are not secure, America is not safe from terrorism, the economy is lagging and immigrants are poised to do harm to the United States. Mr. Brown, as it happens, endorsed Mr. Trump this week.These themes, which have helped propel Mr. Trumps ascension in the polls, might also help him regain his trajectory after a loss in Iowa. Immigration is one of the few issues where Mr. Trump is to the right of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and one where he can puncture Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as too moderate.Mr. Trumps first wave of ads framed illegal immigration as a national security concern in stark terms, and he has used this argument to shape the Republican debate for months.Now, theyre all trying to be tougher than me  nobody can be tougher than me, Mr. Trump said Tuesday night at the rally in New Hampshire where Mr. Brown endorsed him.The Brown campaign was not alone in deploying a focus on national security and immigration in the midterm races two years ago.Other Republicans sensed the growing anxieties of voters: Representative David Brat of Virginia beat Eric Cantor, the incumbent congressman and a member of the Republican leadership, in their 2014 primary race by combining worries about immigration and terrorism. And Senator Thom Tillis used a similar message in North Carolina.Soon after Mr. Brats victory, attempts at a comprehensive immigration overhaul crumbled in Congress, and Mr. Obama announced plans for executive actions to halt some deportations. National Republicans became less fearful of their candidates talking about illegal immigration at that point, and it was a topic in several races.Still, after the 2014 midterms in November, Republicans and business leaders believed they had found a way to placate voters fears and contain the insurgencies, a conclusion that turned out to be far from correct.Trump is hitting a message that has been building in the country for some time, said Greg Mueller, a Republican strategist who advised the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan when he challenged President George Bush in the Republican primary in New Hampshire in 1992. Candidates positioning themselves otherwise in the primary, such as by supporting immigration reform, he added, may as well be committing political suicide.In New Hampshire, concerns about immigration have long been a potent weapon. Mr. Buchanan talked in 1992 about building the Buchanan fence along the southern tier of the country.Must we absorb all the people of the world into our society, and submerge our historic character as a predominantly Caucasian Western society? said Mr. Buchanan to the columnist George Will at the time.More recently, Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who is challenging Senator Kelly Ayotte for her seat, was among the first Democratic governors to call for a halt to Syrian refugees coming into the country after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.Im surprised nobody picked up on it prior to him, Michael Dunbar, a local conservative activist, said of Mr. Trump. Mr. Dunbar led the Draft Trump movement in 1987, when the real estate developer was promoting his book The Art of the Deal.The border has been an issue for a decade, Mr. Dunbar said, comparing concerns about illegal border crossings to worries about a terrorist threat.I live in a small town in Hampton, New Hampshire. I dont worry a whole lot about terrorists. But if I got to a city, Ive got to be aware here. I shouldnt have to do that in my country.Mr. Brown was among the first to use the immigration issue in ads in Senate contests in the 2014 midterm races. He ultimately aired three spots, all of them insinuating a threat in more muted tones than Mr. Trump has used.Scott was careful to stress the need for compassion when addressing the immigration crisis and avoided using caustic immigration rhetoric so that he didnt alienate independent voters who can tip the balance of New Hampshire elections, said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked on the Brown campaign.But by the end of the race, Mr. Brown said he was voicing rational fears of voters, and yoked immigration concerns to the Ebola outbreak in the fall of 2014.For voters concerned about illegal immigration, the issue cuts against a rigid view in New Hampshire that laws are meant to be enforced.In interviews, some of Mr. Trumps ardent supporters have frequently mentioned immigration as a reason for supporting him, even echoing those ads from Mr. Brown.Im a Polish immigrant; my parents came over from Poland in the 1930s, and my grandparents, said Carol Le Lacheur, the former daughter-in-law of a local official in Lowell, Mass., just over the border from New Hampshire, who attended a rally of 7,500 people for Mr. Trump.They taught us to work hard, to be loyal to this country.Her family, she said, came to the country legally.Mr. Fehrnstrom, Mr. Browns former consultant, called the Republican Party leaders redirection on immigration after the 2012 election a huge miscalculation.They told their candidates to support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants as a way to increase outreach to Hispanics, said Mr. Fehrnstrom, who also advised Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race.And candidates who followed that advice are struggling. Donald Trump went in the opposite direction and he has total command of the 2016 field."}
{"text": "Argentina has offered to pay $6.5 billion to a group of hedge funds holding bonds it defaulted on 14 years ago in a historic effort by the nation to put a bitter legal battle behind it.Montreux Partners and Dart Management, two of the hedge funds, have accepted the proposal, which would pay three-quarters of a $9 billion claim on defaulted bonds, according to emailed statements from Daniel A. Pollack, a court-appointed arbiter, and Argentinas finance ministry.The news comes after a week of high-profile talks between senior Argentine government officials and principals at a group of holdout hedge funds, so named for their refusal to partake in Argentinas debt restructurings after its 2001 default and who have sought billions in bond repayments, according to a statement from Mr. Pollack.Noticeably absent from the deal on Friday was NML Capital, a hedge fund owned by the billionaire Paul E. Singer, which has led the holdouts in years of litigation. Without the agreement of all six hedge funds, Argentina will continue to be locked out of international markets and foreign investment.The negotiations were intense, but civil, and I am pleased to report that enormous progress has been made, Mr. Pollack said.The legal fight has pitted a larger group of hedge funds against Argentina, a nation of about 43 million people. They have sought Argentinas assets around the world, at one point seizing a navy ship in Ghana as collateral. At a low point of the standoff, neither side would talk to the other.Earlier this week, Argentina struck a deal to pay $1.35 billion to another group of holdouts  Italian investors who had held onto defaulted bonds, paving the way for an agreement with some of the hedge funds. The fact that Argentina has been able to settle with some of the holdout hedge funds could apply pressure on the remaining hedge funds to resolve the dispute.The legal battle harks back to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on billions of dollars in debt. Bondholders were given two chances to exchange the defaulted bonds for new, cheaper ones over the years, but some rejected the restructurings.This litigation has gone on for nearly 15 years, since the original Argentine default of 2001, and the proposal by Argentina is a historic breakthrough, which, if the conditions mentioned above are met, will allow Argentina to return to the global financial markets to raise much needed capital, Mr. Pollack said. He added that he hoped the other hedge funds and Argentina would be able to resolve their differences and also reach an agreement.Mauricio Macri, Argentinas newly elected president, has pledged to resolve the dispute with the hedge funds as part of a broader plan to reform his nations economy.It is unclear how soon Argentina would complete the offer, which requires congressional approval. Argentinas Congress does not reconvene from a summer recess until March 1, although Mr. Macri has called special sessions in the Senate for Feb. 11 to expedite his appointment of Supreme Court judges and other officials.If there is significant progress between the government and creditors over the proposal in the coming days, there is a chance the offer may also be debated during these special sessions, said Juan Cruz Daz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm in Buenos Aires.Mr. Macri does not have a majority in either the Senate or the lower house, but he was bolstered this week when a group of lawmakers once loyal to former President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, a political opponent of Mr. Macri, defected from her bloc in the lower house. They have promised to be collaborative, making Mr. Macris negotiations to pass pivotal legislation an easier task. Mr. Macri has also been maneuvering to gather cross-party support in the Senate.Dart Management could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Elliott Management, which owns NML Capital, declined to comment. Michael Straus, a principal of Montreux Partners, said he had nothing to add to the publicly issued statements of the special master and the government of Argentina.Senators respond largely to the interests of state governors. Across the political spectrum, these governors are keen to increase funding by issuing their own debt in international markets, Mr. Daz said. I believe Macri is very close to securing congressional support for the offer, he added.Twelve years ago, NML Capital sued Argentina seeking full repayment  principal and interest. In 2011, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that whenever Argentina paid one group of bondholders, it would also have to pay the holdouts.The deal with New York creditors hit rock bottom under Ms. Kirchner, after the country defaulted on its debt again in 2014, after it failed to make a $539 million interest payment on newer discounted bonds.Default is not a mere technical condition, but rather a real and painful event that will hurt real people, Mr. Pollack said at the time, after failed attempts to get NML Capital and the administration of Ms. Kirchner to sit down together.The move left Argentina largely cut off from the international markets. Mr. Macris pledge helped usher in new talks and raised hopes for an agreement.In addition to senior government officials, Luis Caputo, Argentinas finance secretary, traveled to Manhattan this week for the talks. It was not always apparent that a deal would emerge. To start, Mr. Macri promised to publicly announce a proposal for the hedge funds this week. But those holdouts had requested that Argentina sign a nondisclosure agreement to not to reveal the details of the negotiations publicly.Another sticking point for both sides has been just how much interest Argentina would be willing to pay to the hedge funds.Earlier this year, Argentinas economic minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, foreshadowed potential friction between the two parties. Speaking at a news conference with reporters in Buenos Aires, he estimated that the debt owed to holdout bondholders  including NML Capital and the Italian bondholders  totaled $20 billion, adding that 60 percent of that amount fell under New York jurisdiction.For holdout creditors who want Argentina to pay significantly more in interest than on the original amount of the debt owed, Mr. Prat-Gay said, Youd perhaps have to go before Christ to get a such a big return."}
{"text": "Tens of thousands of civilians have fled the city of Aleppo and its environs in recent days as the Syrian military, backed by the punishing air power of Russian jets, made an aggressive push into a region of the country that long ago fell from government control.Many of the fleeing civilians had remained in their homes for years despite the war raging all around them. Their flight alarmed aid groups and scuttled peace talks held in Geneva, and it filled social media with homemade video and personal accounts of their harried trek.Many of the videos posted online in recent days showed the devastation in and around Aleppo that drove so many people to leave. Each clip provides a glimpse into life in wartime, but because of the nature of social media posts in conflict zones, there are things about them that sometimes cannot be determined, including the identities of individuals who made videos and whether or not they are still alive.One video posted to YouTube by members of Al Buraq Media Institution, an activist media group, showed what it said were the first moments after a Russian airstrike in the Aleppo neighborhood of Mashhad. The scene is chaotic: Emergency sirens wail, the street is strewn with chunks of rubble, a thick cloud of dust hangs in the air and high-pitched voices can be heard shrieking. It is not clear how many people were killed or injured in the strike.Another antigovernment media group, the Shahba Press Agency, shared several videos from the battered towns north of the city on social media.In one video, two unidentified men in Marea, a town 15 miles north of Aleppo, are shown standing amid the ruins of a building, where twisted metal rods sprout like weeds from shattered blocks of pale concrete.This is what the Russian jets have wrought, and the jets of the regime, one of the men said. The ruined buildings had once housed civilians, he said, but the government beats us as if we are all terrorists here, as if we are all ISIS.A second video the group shared shows a sobbing child, covered in dust, being rescued from the rubble of a recently bombed building. The blast dropped a piece of concrete larger than the boys body on his head, pinning him to the ground. It is not clear if he survived.Those clips set the stage for another video posted online by the Shahba Press Agency that showed thousands of people waiting at a closed Turkish border crossing. A child, who did not provide his name, explained why they fled.Because of the strikes of Russia and Iran and Bashar, the boy said, in reference to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.He also said the refugees were fleeing the Party of Dogs and the Party of Satan, in reference to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose name in Arabic means Party of God.The boy said that coalition of forces attacked our homes and, in reference to the government forces, that the Shiite army had advanced on their towns.Similar scenes appeared again and again in social media videos posted from the Turkish border region in recent days.A man who identified himself on YouTube and Facebook as Mohammad Nour Mhiemaed posted two videos that showed large numbers of people traveling toward Turkey.The first video, posted on Thursday, shows a line of honking cars clogging a road that Mr. Mhiemaed described as leading toward the Turkish border crossing at Bab al-Salameh.A second video showed a steady stream of refugees, including a large number of women and children, inside what the cameraman described as the Syrian side of the crossing. He said the border had not been opened and he blamed the United States, a rumor whose popularity cannot be determined from the clip.Mr. Mhiemaed then made a claim that felt more like a statement of fact: All these refugees are going to need the Turks."}

{"text": "Over dinner one night in Harlem, the Rev. Nicholas Richards delivered the news to his father. The younger Mr. Richards was the assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist, one of the most storied African-American churches in the country. In his early 30s, he was a princeling awaiting the call to his own pulpit.But that evening last summer, Mr. Richards looked at his father and told him that he was leaving his prestigious position to found an online start-up. His father, Bernard Richards, could only ask: How are you going to make money on this? How are you going to take care of yourself?For all its financial uncertainty, though, the start-up promised to deepen Mr. Richardss religious life. He was leaving Abyssinian to create a website called Roho  the Swahili word for spirit  that would both archive and disseminate videos of the sermons of black ministers. The site would also, in this era of analytics, compile data on how, when and why users viewed the sermons.Now, a year later, Roho has 15,000 hours of sermons from several hundred ministers and draws 50,000 visitors a month. And, going to Bernard Richardss fatherly worries, his son has raised $500,000 in venture capital from a cadre of African-American investors.Its the whole idea of Spotify meets the word of God, said the Rev. Dr. Charley Hames Jr., the senior pastor of Beebe Memorial Cathedral in Oakland, Calif., and one of the ministers featured on Roho.Its a continuation, said Dr. Lawrence Mamiya, an author of the authoritative history The Black Church in the African-American Experience. Black churches got into radio technology quite early, in the 20s, and when television came in, they got into that. The pastors who have become savvy with technology have tried to use it, putting information and sermons online. And collecting data from sermons is a real advance.Indeed, such technological disruption runs headlong into one of the proudest traditions of the black church  the aural and visual spectacle of what is called the preaching moment. The Sunday morning sermon in a black church typically runs 45 minutes or more, nearly the length of an entire service in a Roman Catholic or mainline Protestant church.Many of todays great black ministers come from elite divinity schools and can inflect their homilies with biblical historicity, Greek and Hebrew etymology, and the modern theology of Tillich and Niebuhr. But the classic sermon still consists of the old-fashioned three points and a whoop. (A whoop, for the uninitiated, is the preachers climactic moment of sung-spoken improvisation under the influence of the Holy Spirit.) And the relevant metrics are how many amens the congregation offers and how many sinners answer the call to the altar.At the same time, as Dr. Mamiya noted, black churches have seized on the efficacies of the digital revolution. Churches use websites for everything from receiving tithes to teaching discipleship classes. Major congregations live-stream their services and upload their pastors sermons onto YouTube. And there are a handful of donation-supported websites that collate examples of black preaching, though often only as text from a geographical area.Such was the church world as Mr. Richards experienced it during his graduate studies at Emory University in Atlanta and at Union Theological Seminary in New York, and in nearly a decade as an intern and then a staff member at Abyssinian. He had taught himself a bit of computer coding along the way, but never considered himself particularly tech-inclined.Inspiration first flickered several years ago, when he delivered a sermon as the guest preacher for an out-of-town church. A congregant asked Mr. Richards if he could share a copy of the oration. And Mr. Richards came to realize that what the listener probably wanted was not just one sermon but access to many.There was, to Mr. Richardss knowledge, no single online repository for outstanding black sermons. So he spent a weekend in early 2014 building a rudimentary website with audio files of sermons. He then conscripted about a dozen of his college friends from Morehouse and Spelman to serve as a focus group to provide feedback. More formal test groups were assembled later.Their recurrent response  we do not just want to hear a sermon, we want to be able to discuss it as an online community  encouraged Mr. Richards to start building that function, though it has not yet gone live. He has already taken his friends advice about making biblical passages and inspirational writings available on the site.Mr. Richardss beta testers also awakened him to the way a site like Roho could not only put out content but also collect data  about what kind of sermons people sought, about the demographics of users, about how long a viewer or listener would actually stick with a given sermon.I found this  la carte version of people experiencing their faith, Mr. Richards recalled. People want to choose. I want a sermon about marriage, about 10 minutes long, and I want it at 2 in the morning on a Wednesday. In early 2015, Mr. Richards put together a business plan. It included numbers about the money black Christians gave to their churches  one estimate sets it at $420 billion since 1980  and included a way to generate revenue. Essentially, ministers would trade use of their sermons for access to Rohos user metrics. Both individual and institutional users would pay for premium use of the site. And, on the assumption Roho attracted sufficient eyeballs, advertisers would sponsor content. (The site has been free to all users thus far in order to build traffic, but is expected to convert to a pay model next month.)One of the first prospective investors to receive the pitch was David J. Grain. A native of Brooklyn who grew up in the church, Mr. Grain had gone onto to start a private equity firm focused on media and communications. Now in Sarasota, Fla., he said he missed regular access to high-quality preaching. He became Rohos lead investor.Im someone who likes to get his pray on, Mr. Grain said. So, most importantly, Roho was something I was looking for. You dont write a check like mine otherwise.But I also try to Moneyball anything I do, he continued, referring to a book and movie about a data-driven, analytical approach to assembling a competitive baseball team. I try to grind lots of data. So someone like Nicholas, who started with data, showed an unusual and refreshing level of commitment.With $500,000 in seed money in hand  the goal is to raise at least $5 million  Mr. Richards still faced the problem of persuading black ministers, particularly those of the boomer generation or older, to willingly part with sermons, their most cherished intellectual property.They dont understand it, he said of cyberspace. They come from an environment where the sermon is a dialogue rather than a monologue. And they worry that if they use technology, people wont go to church. Itll cost them members. Itll bring down the giving.To try to assuage such concerns, Mr. Richards brought on as a consultant Martha Simmons, the publisher of a widely read magazine about African-American ministry. With her, Mr. Richards landed several prominent ministers, including the Rev. Dr. Cynthia L. Hale, the pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, Ga., and the Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III, pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.Even some of those who were initially cautious, such as the Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist, agreed to give Roho a try.Our calling, at least as I see it, is spreading the word of God, he said. And any way you can, you should avail yourself of it. This is a new tool. I wonder how people felt about Gutenberg when he came up with the press."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Some of the nations intelligence agencies raised alarms last spring as the State Department began releasing emails from Hillary Clintons private server, saying that a number of the messages contained information that should be classified top secret.The diplomats saw things differently and pushed back at the spies.In the months since, a battle has played out between the State Department and the intelligence agencies  as well as Congress  over what information on Mrs. Clintons private server was classified and what was the routine business of American diplomacy, according to government officials and letters obtained by The New York Times.At the center of that argument, the officials said, is a top secret program of the Central Intelligence Agency that is anything but secret. It is the agencys long effort to track and kill suspected terrorists overseas with armed drones, which has been the subject of international debates, numerous newspaper articles, television programs and entire books.The Obama administrations decision to keep most internal discussions about that program  including all information about C.I.A. drone strikes in Pakistan  classified at the top secret level has now become a political liability for Mrs. Clintons presidential campaign.Some of the skirmishes over Mrs. Clintons emails reflect the disagreements in a post-9/11 era over what should be a government secret and what should not. Nonetheless, 22 emails on Mrs. Clintons server were held back from a tranche made public last week. Those 22 emails were deemed so highly secret that State Department officials in this case agreed with the intelligence agencies not to release them even in redacted form.The emails are included in seven distinct chains that comprise forwarded messages and replies, and in most cases involved discussions of the C.I.A. drone program, government officials said.At a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire on Thursday night, Mrs. Clinton dismissed the issue, as she has in the past. She said the government was overzealously classifying information after the fact, citing as evidence the State Departments finding that two emails sent to Colin L. Powells private email account and 10 others sent to the personal accounts of aides to Condoleezza Rice when each served as secretary of state should now be classified years after the fact. It is against the law to have classified information outside a secure government account.This just beggars the imagination, Mrs. Clinton said, going on to argue that the issue was merely an extension of Republican criticism over the attack against the American mission and C.I.A. annex in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.It remains unknown what exactly the 22 emails contain, given their classification as top secret, but the officials described them generally, on the condition of anonymity. The officials included people familiar with or involved in the handling of the emails in government agencies and in Congress.Spokesmen and women for the State Department, the C.I.A. and the intelligence agencies inspector general declined to comment on the content of the emails.Some of the emails include material classified at the highest levels, known as Top Secret/S.A.P., according to a letter sent to the Senate on Jan. 14 by the inspector general of the nations intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III. That designation refers to special access programs, which are among the governments most closely guarded secrets.Several officials said that at least one of the emails contained oblique references to C.I.A. operatives. One of the messages has been given a designation of HCS-O  indicating that the information was derived from human intelligence sources  a detail that was first reported by Fox News. The officials said that none of the emails mention specific names of C.I.A. officers or the spy agencys sources.The government officials said that discussions in an email thread about a New York Times article  the officials did not say which article  contained sensitive information about the intelligence surrounding the C.I.A.s drone activities, particularly in Pakistan.The officials said that at least one of the 22 emails came from Richard C. Holbrooke, who as the administrations special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan would have been intimately involved in dealing with the ramifications of drone strikes. Mr. Holbrooke died in December 2010.Mrs. Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state was first disclosed in March, and since then the State Department has slowly released 33,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton and her aides determined were work-related. None of the emails sent through Mrs. Clintons server were marked as classified, the officials said, and most were written by her aides and forwarded to her. That is also true of the emails forwarded to Mr. Powell and Ms. Rice, which until now have been in the departments unclassified archives.The handling of classified information on Mrs. Clintons server is now the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the State Departments security and intelligence bureaus. According to the law and security procedures Mrs. Clinton agreed to follow when she became secretary, such material should not even have been sent over the State Departments official but unclassified state.gov server.At the same time, the officials said, some of the classifications being sought for the emails fall into a gray area between public knowledge and secrecy. In such instances, the original source of the information  and thus the level of its classification  can be disputed, and has been, vigorously at times, they said. Other emails have been the subject of rigorous debate over what constitutes a secret and what the nations diplomats can say about intelligence matters as they grapple with international crises.While the secretary of state has a duty to protect classified information, as all of us do in a position of trust, here she did not have the benefit of six-plus months of interagency classification reviews, said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. The same information said by people in two different positions may receive two opposite classification determinations. Though the State Department accepted the C.I.A.s classification of the 22 emails, it has also sought to challenge accusations that it was negligent in handling secrets.During the review, the State Department has rebutted claims by at least one intelligence agency that information in some of the emails ought to remain classified.Some of those include the emails that led Mr. McCulloughs office to refer the matter to the Justice Department last summer, prompting the F.B.I.s investigation. Mr. McCullough made the referral based on an assessment that four of 40 emails that it sampled early on in the process contained top secret information.Now, after months of review, only one of those four turned out to be classified at that level. (The State Department counts that email among the 22 of last week.) A second of the four emails has been downgraded to confidential, the lowest level of classification. The third was released last fall.The fourth involved an email sent by Kurt M. Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, shortly after a North Korean ballistic missile test in July 2009. The email has not yet been made public, even in redacted form, but the State Department has challenged an assertion from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which gathers data through satellite images, that the email included information that came from a highly classified program.In a letter this past Dec. 15 to Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a State Department official said that the information could not have been based on N.G.A.s intelligence because Mr. Campbell did not receive any classified intelligence briefings for what was a new job for him until a few days after the North Korean test.More broadly, the memo stated, diplomats working at the State Department or in embassies around the world constantly receive and pass on information from unclassified sources  so-called parallel reporting  that can involve highly classified matters. That can make it difficult to determine with confidence whether information in any single email came from a classified source.When policy officials obtain information from open sources, think tanks, experts, foreign government officials, or others, the fact that some of the information may also have been available through intelligence channels does not mean that the information is necessarily classified, the departments assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Julia Frifield, wrote in the December letter to Mr. Corker.Another email whose classification has been disputed was dated April 20, 2011, and was among those that prompted members of Congress and Mr. McCulloughs office to begin a review of the State Departments release of the emails by court order under the Freedom of Information Act.It was from Timmy T. Davis, an officer in the State Departments Operations Center, and it conveyed to Mrs. Clintons senior staff security concerns in Libya during the war against the countrys leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.At the time, J. Christopher Stevens, the future ambassador to the country, was secretly traveling there as an envoy to the opposition leadership and had telephoned the Ops Center, as it is known, to advise it about his situation on the ground.Mr. Davis sent his message, marked S.B.U., or sensitive but unclassified to two of Mrs. Clintons closest aides, Huma Abedin and Jacob J. Sullivan, as well as to Alice G. Wells, an executive assistant to Mrs. Clinton who is now the ambassador to Jordan.At issue were two sentences in the email referring to reports by Africom, the American military command for Africa, describing the movement of Colonel Qaddafis forces near the city of Ajdabiya. In a letter on Nov. 24 last year, Ms. Frifield detailed how the information in the email differed significantly from the suspected intelligence source and could well have been based on public briefings given the day before by NATOs military about the course of the war.The conclusion that the information in the email was drawn from that intelligence product is unsubstantiated and on its face wrong, given the differences between the information in the email and the information in the product, Ms. Frifield wrote.Even in the case of the drone program, so much information about the strikes has filtered into public view that the C.I.A. did not object to every allusion to it, allowing at least vague references in the emails that the State Department has released so far.In late October 2009, as she prepared for a trip to Pakistan, Mrs. Clinton asked her aides for good answers to questions she might expect while in the country about Blackwater, the private security company that Pakistanis had long suspected was secretly operating inside the country.Ms. Abedin responded by email that the aides were working on an answer sheet for the tough questions she might get on the thorniest issues about American-Pakistani relations  including Blackwater, the security of Pakistans nuclear arsenal, and drones.You will have tonite or tomorrow am, Ms. Abedin wrote."}
{"text": "KANAB, Utah   The mourners and sympathizers came from across the West on Friday, in pickups flying American flags, to attend the funeral here of LaVoy Finicum, the one member of a band of armed protesters in Princeton, Ore., who was killed last week after a car chase with the authorities.Other members of the group, who had taken over a federal wildlife sanctuary in a quest to claim government land, were arrested in the episode, while four protesters remain holed up in Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  under indictment and sporadically negotiating with the F.B.I.Mr. Finicum, who was 54 and lived just southwest of here in Cane Beds, Ariz., was a rancher and father of 11. To his detractors, he was a doctrinaire leader of an illegal protest that is deeply opposed by many who live near the refuge. To his admirers  many of whom traveled great distances to attend his daylong funeral  he was a martyr to an antigovernment cause.We just felt compelled to be here, to honor a true patriot, said Jeff Esposito, 60, who had driven more than five hours from Kingman, Ariz., to mourn a man he had never met. And after this we are going to carry his mission forward: to push back against the government.In this small city of red rocks and sagebrush, about a thousand people packed a low-slung Mormon church for the funeral. Not a seat remained open; some people gathered in overflow rooms. Boys in jeans and crisp white shirts stood silently along the walls, camel-colored cowboy hats in hand, as the Finicum children sang hymns and sobbed their way through speeches.In the back, a Nevada woman, Diana Clark, 36, said Mr. Finicum and other occupiers had awoken a giant.All of us ranchers feel like were backed into a corner, she said. And its hard to get anyone to acknowledge our needs, and so they gave us a platform.Among the visitors was Cliven Bundy  whose sons Ammon and Ryan led the takeover at Malheur  and several people who had participated in the occupation, including Nickolai Thornton, 39.He was a father figure, no doubt about it, said Mr. Thornton, of Montana, who added that he was in a car just behind Mr. Finicum on the day the rancher died, and that he narrowly missed being apprehended by the authorities. He was a true cowboy.After the service, the Finicum family exited the church and two of Mr. Finicums daughters spoke to an audience that included cowboys on horseback and members of so-called patriot groups wearing camouflage and carrying small weapons.The women vowed to continue their fathers fight against the federal government.Yesterdays extremists typically become tomorrows heroes, Tierra Belle Collier said. Do we believe that two hands up in surrender justifies the use of deadly force? she continued, calling for a second investigation into her fathers death.Behind her sat the elder Mr. Bundy, who became a rallying figure for some in the rural West after federal authorities tried to confiscate cattle he had been grazing illegally. He watched the scene on horseback. Im here to honor a great man, he said after the speeches. He was basically crucified.Mr. Finicum had been among the first armed activists to take over the Malheur refuge, 30 miles south of Burns, Ore., on Jan. 2 to protest federal ownership of Western lands and demand that the lands be turned over to local ownership. What followed was a standoff against law enforcement, led by Ammon and Ryan Bundy and comprising primarily people from outside Oregon. The protesters set up camp in the federal property, ripped down a fence and commandeered vehicles belonging to the federal Fish and Wildlife Service. Mr. Finicum led a videotaped tour of the Burns Paiute Indian artifacts that were stored at the facility, angering the tribe.After weeks in which the authorities did not confront the protesters  though the townspeople and even the governor of Oregon demanded that they leave  a convoy of the protest leaders left the Malheur compound on Jan. 26 for the town of John Day, north of Burns, where they planned to hold a community meeting to muster support.Instead, the two cars of protesters were apprehended by the police. While some were taken into custody, Mr. Finicum was fatally shot after he sped away from law enforcement officers and drove his pickup into a snowdrift as he tried to breach a police barrier. He got out of the car, and after it looked to the officers like he was reaching in his jacket for a gun, he was shot, the authorities have said.Disputes continue over the circumstances of Mr. Finicums death and over how he should be remembered. He himself had said that he considered death preferable to prison.In a video released by the authorities, Mr. Finicum can be seen climbing from the vehicle and flailing his arms after it ended up in a ditch near the roadblock. He appears to reach for something as he is shot by the police. The Deschutes County Sheriffs Office is leading an investigation into his death, which will take at least a month.In recent days, antigovernment groups around the country have called his death unjustified, holding demonstrations and sometimes invoking the language of the Black Lives Matter movement. Hands up, dont shoot, protesters yelled at one event in Oregon.Others called Mr. Finicums death tragic but warned that making him a martyr could inspire future antigovernment action. Hes no folk hero, said Mark Pitcavage, who studies extremism for the Anti-Defamation League and recently wrote about Mr. Finicums death. Hes no hero at all. Hes just a guy who got caught up in an extreme cause. And ended up dying because of that."}
{"text": "NEW HAVEN   The mood inside the John J. Lee Amphitheater on Friday evening felt mostly like impatience. Fans filled rickety wooden bleachers that have ached for success. Basketball dominance in the Ivy League has been cyclical for the past 40 years or so. The cycles always seemed to miss Columbia and Yale.The sight of both teams sharing firm command of the Ivy League this season seemed cause for celebration, even in early February. Without a postseason tournament, there was also a sense that the game between them could provide the slim buffer needed for either one to earn what has eluded them for decades: an automatic N.C.A.A. tournament bid.In front of a robust crowd, Yale looked shaky at the start. But the Bulldogs calmed their nerves and settled into their typical, pounding formula, shooting 61.5 percent from the field while wearing down Columbia, 86-72.Turning the ball over 17 times and still getting a win, Coach James Jones said, it shows you how good you can be.The win inched the Bulldogs (14-5, 5-0) closer to their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 1962. Columbia (15-7, 4-1) has not earned a bid since 1968. Since then, the league has been so heavily dominated by four teams  Harvard, Cornell, Penn and Princeton  that only once has another program sneaked to an outright title (Brown in 1986). But this season, the league appears bound for a shake-up.Yale and Harvard finished as co-champions last season, but Harvard won the one-game playoff for the automatic bid to the tournament. Although the Bulldogs graduated four players, one key contributor came back: Justin Sears, the reigning Ivy League player of the year, who scored a game-high 27 points.But Yale also regained one of last seasons noncontributors. Forward Brandon Sherrod had sat out last season to travel the globe as a tenor in Yales distinguished all-male a cappella group, the Whiffenpoofs. He came back better than ever. His 25 points, a career high, and 8 rebounds bolstered the Bulldogs.I dont know where wed be without him, Jones said.When Brandon and Justin are playing at that level, its very difficult to lose a game, he added. They just dominate inside by the basket.Sherrod had gone 15 for 15 from the field for 38 points in two games last weekend. Entering Friday, he had not missed a shot since Jan. 16  a string of 25 consecutive made field goals, one shy of the N.C.A.A. record. It did not take him long to break it. With a layup six minutes in, Sherrod claimed the record with his 27th in a row.He started 5 for 5, bringing his total to 30, before finally missing a short contested shot with 4 minutes 45 seconds left in the half.I was kind of bummed I missed it, Sherrod said, smiling. But it had to come to an end eventually.Columbias 4-0 start in league play was a first for the program since 1994. Led by three seniors  Maodo Lo, Alex Rosenberg and Grant Mullins  the Lions were picked just behind Yale in the preseason projections. After the Lions lost five of their first nine games, there was concern that the team was not performing as it should. But Columbia rallied to win 12 of its next 13.Weve been defending, Columbia Coach Kyle Smith said. I still feel great about our defensive effort.Indeed, Columbia swiped at dribbles and knifed into passing lanes. The team gathered 11 steals, seven by Lo alone, tying a Columbia record.In fact, Yale turned the ball over four times in its first five possessions, allowing Columbia to quickly jump ahead, 10-5. But the Bulldogs regrouped to shoot 71.4 percent in the first half, including 7 of 10 from 3-point range, and led by 9 with just over two minutes remaining.There were certain possessions where I felt like we played good defense, Lo said. They just hit tough shots.A fall-away 3-pointer by Blake Reynolds with 2.8 seconds in the half gave the Bulldogs a 41-33 lead. The Lions crawled back to trail by 3, after Lo banked a 3-pointer off the glass with just over eight minutes remaining, make it 60-57. The score was 64-58 when Sears stepped out to drill a 3-pointer with 5:47 left, prompting a timeout from Smith.The Bulldogs looked mature in the final minutes, preventing the Lions from sneaking back in. They put Columbia in the bonus and bled the game out from the free-throw line. The Lions, averaging 76.5 points entering the game, were held to 44.1 percent shooting and just 9 of 31 from 3-point range.Threes were the separation, Smith said. We didnt make ours, and they hit theirs."}
{"text": "BERLIN   An Algerian couple, suspected of planning a terrorist attack in Berlin and arrested on suspicion of belonging to the Islamic State, entered Germany late last year and applied for asylum as Syrian refugees  part of a pattern of terrorism suspects entering Europe under the guise of fleeing war, the German authorities said Friday.The police in Berlin published a photo they said was of the husband, showing a bearded man with his face blacked out, pointing a pistol at the camera, with two Kalashnikov rifles propped up beside him on a sofa strewn with other weapons. The photo was believed to have been taken in Syria, where German media reports said the man had received terrorist training with the Islamic State.The man, not named by the police but identified by the media as Farid A., 34, and his wife, 27, had been sought on an international warrant initiated by the Algerian authorities. They were under surveillance at their refugee shelter in the town of Attendorn, about an hours drive northeast of Cologne, and were arrested in coordinated raids in three states on Thursday. They were suspected of plotting an attack in Berlin, the police said Friday in a statement.As many as one million asylum seekers entered Germany last year. An initial warm welcome, particularly for Syrians, soured after the terrorist attacks in and around Paris in November, which killed 130 people, and the police found documents suggesting that some assailants had entered Europe posing as refugees.Hundreds of assaults and robberies during New Years Eve celebrations in Cologne, attributed to young men of Arab or North African backgrounds, further heightened fears over the consequences of the migrant influx.On Friday, the head of Germanys domestic intelligence agency, Hans-Georg Maassen, said the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was using the wave of newcomers to infiltrate Europe.The authorities in Europe have seen repeatedly that terrorists are being smuggled in, camouflaged as refugees, Mr. Maassen said on ZDF public television. That is a fact that security authorities must always seek to recognize and identify.The Berlin police said on Friday that they had first received a tip in December from Mr. Maassens agency, the Office for Protection of the Constitution, that a terrorist plot might be brewing. On Jan. 10, the agency gave an unspecified tip that involved suspected supporters of ISIS possibly involved in planning an attack in Berlin, a police statement said.The tip was taken very seriously and intensive surveillance began, the police said. That procedure established that the affected persons were behaving very noticeably and in a conspirative way.Considering the danger of a possible attack, the police weighed the chances that the suspects would detect the surveillance against the prospect of obtaining more information and decided to go into the open, the statement said. About 300 of the 450 police officers involved in Thursdays raids were deployed in Berlin, where four homes and two businesses were searched. The other raids were in Attendorn and in Hanover.In Berlin, the police arrested an Algerian, 49, who they said had lived in the German capital since 2000 under various identities. He left in 2013 and returned a year later with fake French identity papers, the statement said. He had been sought on charges of falsifying documents, and remained in custody on Friday, as did the Algerian couple.The police said they had so far not found any evidence of a concrete target in Berlin for a terrorist attack. No arms or explosives were found in Thursdays raids, but the police said they had seized a large number of computers, documents and cellphones.Another 30-year-old man was investigated in Berlin and a 25-year-old man at a refugee shelter in Hanover, the police said, but they were not detained. Both were also Algerian citizens.The 30-year-old came to Germany in 2004 and currently had a valid residence permit, the police statement said. It said without further detail that the 25-year-old had had proven contact with Belgium, where several of the Paris terrorist assailants also had ties. German media, citing unidentified security sources, said the younger man had recently visited Molenbeek, the suburb of Brussels where several Paris assailants lived or visited.The police statement said that all five people connected with Thursdays raids had been offered to be formally questioned, and this offer was partly accepted, suggesting that one or more of those held might give more information about the alleged plan for an attack.Asked how much Germany should fear a terrorist attack, Mr. Maassen suggested that was the wrong question.The expression fear is the wrong one here, he said. We are in a situation which is serious, and we have a high risk that there can be a terrorist attack.But, he added, security services and the police are on high alert. Our goal is to minimize the risk, he said."}
{"text": "A 20-year-old sexual-assault accusation against Peyton Manning was reportedly cited by six women in a lawsuit against the University of Tennessee.The Tennessean of Nashville said the accusation was among those outlined in the suit, filed last week, which charges that the university violated Title IX, the federal law requiring equal support for mens and womens athletic programs.The women, former Tennessee students, allege that the universitys athletics department has condoned a hostile sexual environment since the mid-1990s, citing nearly a dozen instances in which former student-athletes were accused of sexual assault.One of those, the newspaper said, involved Manning and a female trainer, an event that came to light publicly in 2003. In 1996, when Manning was a star quarterback at Tennessee, he was accused of placing his exposed genitals on the trainers face while she was examining him. Manning has denied the allegations and said he was mooning a fellow athlete, Malcolm Saxon."}
{"text": "ECATEPEC, Mexico   Pope Francis stepped into the heartland of Mexican inequality on Sunday, presiding over an enormous outdoor Mass in the impoverished outskirts of the capital and urging the joyous crowd not to fall prey to the wealth, vanity and pride that can create a society of the few, and for the few.By coming to Ecatepec, one of the countrys largest, poorest and most violent cities, the Latin American pope placed himself at the center of Mexicos identity crisis. Nagging economic disparity has left nearly half of the country living in poverty while a mere sliver of society controls the rest  even as drug traffickers terrorize large parts of the nation.Standing on a gigantic stage before several hundred thousand people, Francis told his listeners that the Lenten season, which began last week, is one of conversion, and that Mexico needed conversion. He asked Mexicans to turn their nation into a land of opportunities, where there will be no need to emigrate in order to dream, no need to be exploited in order to work, no need to make the despair and poverty of many the opportunism of a few, a land that will not have to mourn men and women, young people and children who are destroyed at the hands of the dealers of death.Francis arrived in Mexico on Friday night, and on Saturday met President Enrique Pea Nieto at the National Palace in Mexico City before addressing Mexicos bishops. His trip to Ecatepec was barely 20 miles away, yet it delivered Francis to a different world, one emblematic of what he often calls the peripheries, the neglected places at the edges of wealth or political power.They take advantage of us with lies, while they sell the country bit by bit, said Valdomero Guzmn Peros, 60, a resident of Ecatepec who rode his bicycle to the Mass, describing the government. We are all hoping that the pope will bring a message to the powerful of our country that they must work for both the rich and the poor.The Mass marked the beginning of Franciss tour of the Mexican peripheries, touching down in locales his predecessors largely skipped before his planned departure on Wednesday evening. Among other places, he will go to the southern border to meet with Mexicos indigenous people, and to the north to address immigration.In Ecatepec, violence by organized crime is on the rise even as chunks of the city are being transformed into luxurious shopping centers well out of reach of its residents. During his years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis dedicated much time to working in slums that had many of the same problems.While not the poorest of the cities and towns surrounding the capital, Ecatepec, population 1.7 million, is home to the largest number of people without access to health care and social services in the State of Mexico.Ecatepec gathers victims at the economic and urban level, said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst in Mexico, a place that symbolizes the devastation of the quality of life of most of its population. It is also a symptom of the way in which organized crime is slowly penetrating Mexicos biggest cities and how this has resulted in a spike of murder rates, kidnapping and extortions.The crowds pulsed with energy early Sunday, walking miles down closed highways from across the region to attend. For the Mass, officials designated a giant open field, which had been covered in gravel and outfitted with more than 30 giant television screens and towering speakers to pump out the pontiffs message. Families gathered in the heat, using blankets strung up on the fencing for shade.In his homily, Francis warned against the three temptations of wealth, vanity and pride, and, in what could be interpreted as an oblique swipe at the Mexican elite, warned against societies in which the few enrich themselves and take the bread on the toil of others.This is the bread that a corrupt family or society gives its own children, Francis said.Upon his arrival, Francis traveled through a new development of tidy condominiums, as well as a megamall with stores like Starbucks, Sears and Burger King less than a mile from one of the countrys worst slums. Many Mexican commentators said the picture of prosperity that the government hoped would be validated by Franciss presence was false.Later in the day, Francis was again swept into the economic divide while visiting a hospital for children in Mexico City. There, he was joined by the first lady of Mexico and, according to the event itinerary, the son of the richest man in Mexico, Carlos Slim.Along the route in Ecatepec, industrious street vendors created a bustling papal market, where hundreds of entrepreneurs spent the morning hawking plates, T-shirts and key chains bearing Francis image.And yet even that commerce, to some degree, reflected Mexicos split reality. More than 60 percent of Mexicos economy remains informal, and workers say the burden of taxes and bureaucracy prevents them from joining the formal sector.I know these people are coming to ask for help, but who is there to help them? asked Claudia Rodriguez Ayala, 46, a vendor selling sandwiches, water and cigarettes along the papal route. Most feel if they come, they can get some manner of help through faith.As throngs of people marched past, she smiled and fished out a bottle of water from her cooler.Or at least lower taxes ordered by the president, she said."}
{"text": "SILAO, Mexico   Sheathed in colorful woolen ponchos and wearing crisp white hats, the cowboys rode their horses through green fields and blond meadows, holding banners of Christ the King and the Virgin of Guadalupe.The cowboys were in the midst of a three-day pilgrimage last month through the central highlands of Guanajuato, an 84-mile trip to the mountaintop statue of Christ the King, among the tallest and most sacred in Mexico.The first pilgrimage began more than 60 years ago, when an ailing cowboy set out to seek salvation at the feet of the statue. Though the region has transformed since then, with family farming giving way to manufacturing, this tradition has grown, attracting thousands of devotees every January. This year, the pilgrimage drew more than 3,000 people, most of them men.Times have changed and we dont harvest as much, said Juan Isidro, a farmer from a nearby ranch who has attended the pilgrimage for eight years. Those traditions are being lost.Amid a modernizing Mexico, rural communities have watched such traditions vanish. Family farms have shuttered. Handicrafts have been consigned to curio tables. Construction has blighted the open countryside. For the pilgrims, most of whom tend cattle and grow crops on the farms of Guanajuato, the journey is not merely an expression of faith. It anchors them to the past.No matter where you live or work, your roots never change, said Juan Manuel Vzquez, a former cowboy who now works as an electrician in the tourist town of San Miguel de Allende, a drive of an hour and half away. He closed his business for the occasion. That is why we all keep coming here, he said.As with any pilgrimage, the journey meant many things to many people, from the spiritual to the practical. Some sought the comfort of religious purpose, while others were drawn to the adventure of sleeping under the stars. A few, hoping their sins would be washed away, sacrificed comfort for redemption. Others simply wanted to pray for rain after months of drought.A few suggested that the desire to take arduous trips in the name of religion was steeped in the nations indigenous cultures, which value personal sacrifice and spiritual purity.We use our faith to survive, to overcome the bitterness of life, said Jos Reyes, who helps oversee the annual journey, which he has made for 40 straight years. He was dressed in bluejeans and cowboy boots covered in a film of dust from the ride; his sunburned cheeks were glowing. This journey makes me feel alive.The trip was a somber affair, the silence broken intermittently by the neighing of horses and the rare bit of conversation. Along the route, the riders passed a General Motors factory, a hulking structure of steel dropped in the middle of a field.At night, they gathered around bonfires to weather the cold, sharing stories of past trips when horses died and pilgrims could not go on. Some used their saddlebags as pillows, stretching out by their horses. By dawn, they were off again.Enforcing the sober atmosphere was Mr. Reyes, the trips official disciplinarian. On top of his light brown horse, he barked orders at the pilgrims, especially the young ones he suspected of goofing off.This isnt a picnic, he yelled, inspecting the line of riders. Dont even think about drinking. We are doing this for Christ, not for fun.The pilgrimage dates to 1954, when a young cowboy named Nicols Garca set off to visit the statue. Suffering from nervous breakdowns, anxiety and hair loss, Mr. Garca was told by doctors that his condition was terminal, his son said.Seeking help from above, Mr. Garca climbed the 8,900-foot hill known as Cubilete to pray before Christ the King.During the journey, he came up with the idea of a yearly pilgrimage for the cowboys of the region, said his son Miguel Angel Garca, who is now in charge of the event. As it happened, Mr. Garca recovered from his afflictions after the trip. Convinced that the pilgrimage had miraculously cured him, he became even more committed to making it a tradition, his son said.The next year, a handful of friends and relatives from his small town near San Miguel de Allende joined. By the following year, there were 80 people.On his deathbed, he asked me not to let that tradition die, said Mr. Garca, who lost his father three years ago.The 75-foot statue of Christ with open arms replaced a smaller version that was destroyed in 1928 during the Cristeros War, which was incited by the antichurch policies of President Plutarco Elas Calles.During the war, priests and Catholic parishioners alike were slaughtered, while anticlerical laws were enacted. During a thaw in the relations between church and state in the 1940s, the statue was reconstructed.The statues rich history has reinforced a deep religiosity among the locals.This is a land of martyrs, explained Juan Francisco Rosas, a student at a local seminary who attended the final Mass of the pilgrimage.The Mass was celebrated beneath the statue, the cowboys attending on horseback, hats in hand. The priest told them that the pilgrimage was a sign of how much they needed God to withstand the pressures of modern life: crushing debt, illness, the violence of drug cartels and unemployment.Even for those who no longer lived in Mexico, who had gone to the United States in search of a better life, the message resonated. Joaqun Villafranco, who left more than 40 years ago to settle in Austin, Tex., has never failed to return for the pilgrimage.Coming back every year, he said, is a way to show gratitude for the opportunities he has found in America.Just before the Mass, Mr. Garca positioned himself near the front, amid the chaos of jostling horses. The days of grueling travel were over. No more sleeping outside. No more long rides.He sighed.This is it, he said, clutching the reins of his horse. The moment where all that cold, heat, hunger and fatigue are worthwhile.The moment you feel Christ close to your heart."}
{"text": "Human Rights Watch released a report Sunday providing new indications that Saudi Arabia has fired American-made cluster munitions, banned by international treaty, in civilian areas of Yemen, and said their use may also violate United States law.The report included photographs from Yemen purporting to show unexploded but potentially lethal remnants of American cluster weapons, suggesting that they had failed legally required reliability standards.If confirmed, the report could put new pressure on the United States over support for its ally Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict. The Americans have sold arms and furnished training and expertise to a Saudi-led coalition that has faced widespread criticism for what rights groups call an indiscriminate bombing campaign against Yemens Houthi rebels in nearly a year of fighting.Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners, as well as their U.S. supplier, are blatantly disregarding the global standard that says cluster munitions should never be used under any circumstances, Steve Goose, the arms director at Human Rights Watch, said in the report.Human Rights Watch and other groups have previously accused Saudi Arabia of using cluster munitions in Yemen, including in a Jan. 6 strike in Sana, the capital, and have criticized the United States as an accomplice.In a Jan. 12 letter to President Obama, Megan Burke, the director of the Cluster Munition Coalition, a disarmament group, urged him to demand that Saudi-led coalition members stop using cluster munitions, and said the United States should investigate its own role in the recent strikes.John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said in a statement Sunday night: We have seen the Human Rights Watch report, and are reviewing it. Obviously we remain deeply concerned by reports of harm to civilians and have encouraged the Saudi-led coalition to investigate reports of civilian harm. Saudi officials did not comment, but have denied ordering the use of cluster munitions in Yemen.Cluster munitions contain submunitions, or bomblets, that disperse widely and kill indiscriminately. Many bomblets can fail to explode, posing a threat to civilians. A 2008 treaty bans the weapons, but major arms suppliers, including the United States and Russia, have not signed it.Sensitive to the criticism, the United States has severely restricted exports of cluster munitions and has sought to improve technology to minimize collateral damage. Under a 2009 law, only cluster munitions with a failure rate of 1 percent or less can be exported, and they can be used only against clearly defined military targets, not where civilians are known to be present.The latest Human Rights Watch report dwelled on what it described as potential violations of that law, based partly on evidence that one type of American cluster bomb sold to the Saudis, the CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon, had been used in at least two attacks and had a failure rate exceeding 1 percent. The evidence raises serious questions about compliance with U.S. cluster munition policy and export rules, Mr. Goose said."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Justice Antonin Scalia Is Dead at 79 (front page, Feb. 14):While I did not agree with almost all of Justice Antonin Scalias positions, I pray for his family. His death throws the Republicans into a conundrum. If they do not act on an Obama nominee, they face public scorn and the possibility of a Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders presidency in which one of those candidates might nominate a real liberal.Justice Scalias passing also makes the presidential race the most important in my lifetime. The next president will shape the Supreme Court for a generation or more, and the freedoms of all Americans hang in the balance.HENRY A. LOWENSTEINNew YorkTo the Editor:It feels unseemly to dive so soon into the political ramifications of Justice Antonin Scalias unexpected passing, and though it may evince a bygone decorum, I am dismayed by those on both sides of the aisle who have done so.I, for one, celebrate the life and success of any fellow citizen who reaches the pinnacle of his profession by dint of intellect, humor and force of personality. My fond hope is that our national ideological gulf has not obscured our ability to celebrate a quintessentially American story, especially when that story belongs to a man whose ideas challenged us to our core.DAVID D. TURNERCanadensis, Pa.To the Editor:Republicans who vow to block President Obamas nominee to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, no matter whom the president names, are taking a high-stakes risk. They are betting the house that the next president will be a conservative Republican, which is by no means a certainty.President Obamas nomination of Justice Scalias successor would perforce give great weight to Republican views of the candidate. Should a Democrat win the White House, however, and the party picks up Senate seats, which is not entirely unlikely, those Republican views would carry far less weight. Is the G.O.P. really ready to roll the dice?MARTIN TOLCHINWashingtonThe writer, a former Washington reporter for The New York Times, is a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.To the Editor:The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, says. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.What disrespect for the American majority that elected Barack Obama to be our president. Twice.ELLEN STEINBAUMBostonTo the Editor:President Obamas nomination of a Supreme Court justice will end his term on a negative note by increasing rancor and division. But he could end his term on a positive note by leaving Justice Antonin Scalias seat unfilled, thus raising the stakes of this presidential election. That would likely increase voter turnout, making for greater participation in our democracy.GABRIEL JIMCanton, Mich.To the Editor:Justice Antonin Scalia placed adherence to constitutional principles ahead of any political agenda.

{"text": "Season 2 of Better Call Saul begins where Season 1 did: in purgatory, which happens to be a Cinnabon in Omaha. Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), once Walter Whites skeevy lawyer, relocated there to save his skin after the bloody denouement of Breaking Bad. Like last years opening sequence, its a lovely, mournful short film, scored this time to the country standard Funny How Time Slips Away.The song is a curious choice, because Better Call Saul does anything but let time slip away. It grabs on to it, jumping backward to 2002, when Saul was Jimmy McGill, a small-time con artist trying to go straight as an attorney in Albuquerque. It slows time down, stretches out key moments like taffy, as if Saul, in his sugar-glazed prison, were holding his past up to the light, trying to find the exact spot where everything went wrong.Entering its second season Monday on AMC, Better Call Saul is not the best drama on TV. But its one of the most unusual and daring. Its show runners, Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, used the capital and patience the prequel had in the bank, as a series with a built-in audience, to tell a quirkily absorbing story of a little guys doomed struggle to break good.Season 1 made Jimmy into both a sleazebag and a hero, trying to parlay the flimflam skills he picked up as a onetime street hustler (they called him Slippin Jimmy, for a fake-accident scam he favored) into a straight career in the courtroom. Despite resistance  not least from his judgmental older brother, Chuck (Michael McKean), an accomplished lawyer turned shut-in  he managed to do his weasel work for good, blowing open a case of fraud at a senior citizens home.Is Jimmy a good guy overcoming bad tendencies, or a bad guy whos fooling himself? The opening of Season 2 slyly raises that introspective theme, as the protagonists face is reflected in a mirror on a Cinnabon employee-motivation sign. It asks, Would you want this person to serve you?Even in triumph, he cant shake the feeling that he will always be Slippin Jimmy.Now, hes weighing a job offer from the head of a top Santa Fe law firm (Ed Begley Jr.) against the feeling that going back to the hustlers life would be easier, more comfortable and more true to himself. As he says to his colleague and sometime sex buddy Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn): People tell me how they see me. And its not as a lawyer.The line implicates the audience, too: We half want Jimmys better self to win out, half want to be entertained by his palaver-spewing Saul side. Better Call Saul is a more fun, picaresque show than Breaking Bad, but its every bit as moral, a travelogue of the smooth-paved desert road to perdition.The show has a con mans view of human nature: People are easy marks, because theyre greedy and willing to take shortcuts. Its full of crooks next door, including a headset-wearing, stock-trading jackass whom Jimmy swindles and a pharmaceutical employee selling meds on the black market.The most powerful story of everyday moral failing in Season 1 came in the episode Five-O, focused on Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a laconic piece of gristle who will later become Saul Goodmans hired gun. (Jimmy meets him as a cranky parking lot attendant who moonlights as freelance muscle.) The episode flashed back to Mikes days as a Philadelphia policeman, when he persuaded his son, also a cop, to take a bribe rather than blow the whistle on corrupt officers. The dirty cops killed Mikes son anyway, and Mike realized, wrenchingly, that his advice cost his childs life and soul: I broke my boy.The experience changed Mike, who is oddly the series moral center: He does his job, however dirty, but he doesnt steal or double dip. His rigidity is as much a survival mechanism as Jimmys bubble-gum pliability. Better Call Saul makes the most of Mr. Bankss rough dignity, just as it brings out the pathos that underlay Mr. Odenkirks verbal tap-dancing in Breaking Bad. (Ms. Seehorn also has a big role in the new season, as the no-nonsense foil who prods Jimmy to be better than he thinks he is.)Though Saul is a cable series, its pacing is reminiscent of a Netflix show, parceling out plot slowly. But it feels confident rather than meandering, full rather than dull. When it lets scenes play out at length, it allows space to show how a con is played or a lie falls apart. Of all the assets it shares with Breaking Bad  the visual playfulness, the A-bomb-bright New Mexico exteriors  the greatest is its ability to suspend time.Better Call Saul could have simply cashed in quick, giving a curtain call to the glib fan favorite Saul from Breaking Bad. Instead, it took the risk of taking Jimmy McGill seriously. Like Jimmy, Mr. Gilligan and Mr. Gould know an opportunity when theyre handed one. Unlike him, they dont seem inclined to screw it up."}
{"text": "BERLIN  A former German chancellor, Gerhard Schrder, recently called Angela Merkels decision to open the door to an unlimited number of refugees a mistake and offered this verdict: Merkel had a heart, but no plan.This view of the German leader, who is beloved but now begrudged, is gaining ground as refugees from a ravaged Syria and elsewhere pour in. Local authorities are strained to the limit. Billions of euros have been spent with no end in sight. Many people came in whose identities are unknown; they have to register if they want handouts, but some have not and there are security concerns. Cologne has become a byword for concern over how a large influx of Muslim men will affect the place and security of women in German society.Three important state elections loom next month. It seems inevitable the far-right Alternative for Germany Party will surge. Merkel will be blamed. Her support has already tumbled. One poll this month showed 46 percent of Germans support her, compared with 75 percent in April last year  and thats with a strong economy. She could be vulnerable if her Christian Democratic Party turns on her. Europe without Merkel will sink.So why did this customarily prudent chancellor do it? Because she is a German, and to be German is to carry a special responsibility for those terrorized in their homeland and forced into flight. Because she once lived in a country, East Germany, that shot people who tried to cross its border. Because a united Europe ushered Germany from its darkest hour to prosperity, and she is not about to let the European Union pitch into mayhem on her watch  as it would with more than a million ragged refugees adrift. And, yes, because she has a heart.Merkel did the right thing. The question now is how she handles the consequences. Management involves setting limits. After taking in more than one million refugees last year, Germany cannot take in that number again in 2016. As Germanys president, Joachim Gauck, said recently: A limitation strategy may even be both morally and politically necessary in order to preserve the states ability to function. He added, If democrats refuse to talk about limits, they leave the field open to populists and xenophobes.But setting limits is not a just a German issue. Its a Syrian issue. Its a Turkish issue. Its a Russian issue. Its an American issue. Its a European issue. Merkel needs Europe to have a functioning external border if it is to remain borderless within the 20-plus-nation Schengen zone. Otherwise national borders will go up. The European Union will unmake itself. No European border, no Schengen! Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, Gaucks chief adviser, told me.Merkels domestic dilemma demands international answers.She needs the Syrian war, the main source of the refugee outflow, to end, but the latest American-Russian plan for a cessation of hostilities almost looks more likely to unravel in the weeks ahead than hold. She needs Turkey, in exchange for billions of euros, to tighten its borders and stop the refugee exodus. But Turkey is playing an extortion game, and is not above a little schadenfreude at seeing the Europe that rejected it fray.In Russia, she needs President Vladimir Putins cooperation, but his strategy is the undermining of a united Europe; a weaponized refugee flow achieves just that. Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, declared in Munich this weekend that, We are rapidly rolling into a period of a new cold war. He asked: Is this 2016 or 1962? Around Aleppo, a world war in miniature unfolds.Merkel needs the United States to exercise its power in a way President Obama has refused to do through the inexorable spread of the Syrian crisis. Unless the United States is prepared to establish a safe area in northern Syria and put pressure on Turkey to turn a chaotic refugee flow into an orderly process, the current untenable situation will persist. If America is unprepared to reverse Russian-Iranian gains in Syria, it must at least show commitment to managing the consequences. She needs European countries like Poland and Hungary  recipients of huge injections of cash from the European Union  to snap out of their ungrateful moods of nationalist xenophobia, but thats not going to happen soon.The European idea has not been this weak since the march to unity began in the 1950s. Germany is awash in so-called Putinversteher  broadly Putin sympathizers like Schrder  who admire him for his strong assertion of Russian national interests. Michael Naumann, a former minister of culture, told me: The United States has left us, we are the orphaned kids in the playground, and theres one tough guy, Putin. Its really that simple.Germany is Europes core, its dominant power. If Merkels refugee gambit implodes, the reverberations will be felt everywhere. The country feels restive, placid on the surface, tense beneath. A woman told me of how a 15-year-old Syrian refugee was admitted to her daughters class. The girls cellphone rang, the ring tone was a muezzins call to prayer, and the teacher burst out: So next youll have a suicide belt! There was embarrassment all around, apologies and parental letters. The situations out of control, the woman said.At the Berlin state office for health and social affairs, a sprawling maze of buildings, white tents have gone up. Long lines of refugees make their way through the various bureaucratic hurdles to identity cards. They huddle in the rain, their sneakers muddy, their jackets too flimsy for the cold.Mustafa Dilaneh left Latakia, Syrias main port, in August, and paid $6,000 for his passage to Germany. He has been granted German residency until Feb. 22; he hopes for a passport after that. He is learning German. He wants to return home, but first, he says, President Bashar al-Assad must go or die. Failing that, he has a dream of America. I love New York so much, he told me. The city no sleep.A Facebook friend taught Dilaneh that phrase. This is the worlds first massive smartphone coordinated migration. Syrians dont see the West as alien; they know it through countless images, brands and tunes. But for some Germans, these Middle Eastern refugees are an alien threat.I went out to Nauen, a small dismal town near Berlin where unemployment is high. Signs brandished at rightist demonstrations last year said, Nauen will stay white. In August, a gymnasium that was to have housed refugees was burned down in an unsolved act of arson. The charred skeleton of the building with its blackened pillars and piles of rubble still stands. It cost about four million euros to build and will need at least that amount to replace.A new emergency center for several hundred refugees is planned nearby, with a view of this stark symbol of hatred. To say Nauen is combustible would be an understatement. There will more protests, Volker Mller, who works to promote intercultural understanding, told me. In some ways this feels like a bigger problem than German reunification.The scale of Germanys challenge is evident at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, built to last by the Nazis, and used in 1948 and 1949 for the Berlin Airlift that, at its height, saw American C-47s landing every 90 seconds to bring the supplies essential for the preservation of freedom in part of the divided German capital. Now the vast 52-foot high hangars are being converted into shelters for thousands of refugees who sleep, 12 to each screened white rectangular bedroom unit, where aircraft were once housed. Already there are 2,600 or so refugees; there may eventually be 7,000. Its our duty to find a place for them, Sascha Langenbach, a spokesman on Berlin social issues, told me. He predicted another 60,000 may come to the capital this year.I spoke to a couple of young refugees from Aleppo, Mahmoud Sultan and Mulham (he preferred not to give his family name out of concern for his familys safety). They complained about the food, about the noise, about the difficulty of studying German, about how weeks stretched into months at this emergency center.They had not wanted to leave Aleppo. But, as Mulham put it: You have this hope the war will end. For one year, two years, three years, you keep this hope. You think, I owe my country something and I will stay. Until in the fifth year you realize there are five wars! The rebels against Assad, ISIS against the Free Syrian Army, the Saudis against Iran, the Kurds against ISIS, and Russia against America! And you lose hope.The refugees did not leave because they had a choice. They left because they concluded they had none. Merkel, given her personal history and her nations, had little choice but to take them in.Now she needs those five wars to abate, and Western allies to come together with something of the resolve that Tempelhof symbolizes, if she is to calm a strained Germany, hold Europe together, and survive. That will require leadership and determination of a kind she demonstrated but that is in short supply in the social-media echo chamber of our times.This column has been updated to reflect news developments."}
{"text": "MUNICH  The failure of world powers to quell the five-year conflict in Syria, the Russian military intervention there and the spread of Islamic terrorism overshadowed an annual security conference here, which came as Europe falters ahead of a new effort to cope with its refugee crisis.The somber tone of the meeting was reflected in comments Sunday by a senior German official close to Chancellor Angela Merkel who said that Russia was unlikely to respect a new accord on ceasing hostilities in Syria given the aggressive hand it has played there and the advantage it has gained by using armed force.Adding to the gloom, France indicated during the meeting it would not join a German plan to redistribute more refugees in Europe. Days before a new European summit meeting, the rebuff highlighted Europes failure to unite around a response to more than one million migrants, even as Russian actions and speech unsettles Europe, particularly Germany.In addition to a drumbeat from Russian news media that Europes way of life is threatened because of the migrants, Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev on Saturday warned the conference about a looming slide into a new Cold War.A blunt assessment of Russias intentions from Norbert Rttgen, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the German Parliament, followed biting criticism from Senator John McCain over the American-Russian accord, announced Friday in Munich, to get aid into some Syrian regions and put into effect a truce plan for the devastated country.The criticism from Mr. Rttgen and Mr. McCain came against the backdrop of news from Syria that no aid trucks had yet moved toward needy regions there, and illustrated how thoroughly the Middle East chaos had dominated the conference, which usually focuses on the trans-Atlantic alliance.However, the United Nations mediator for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said on Sunday that United Nations aid convoys were planned for Tuesday or Wednesday. They will represent an initial test of the Munich commitments, Mr. de Mistura said in an email exchange.As for a pause in fighting, he said he expected it to apply to all areas of Syria except for areas controlled by ISIS and Al Nusra, referring to the Islamic State militant group and the Nusra Front, which the United States and Russia regard as terrorist groups.That provision would allow Russian and Syrian forces to continue airstrikes over parts of Aleppo, where Nusra fighters are thought to be present. A State Department official said last week that different rebel groups are intermingled on the battlefield.President Obama spoke by phone with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday to discuss the agreement made Friday and to stress the importance of rapidly implementing humanitarian access to besieged areas of Syria and initiating a nationwide cessation of hostilities, a statement from the White House said Sunday.President Obama emphasized the importance now of Russia playing a constructive role by ceasing its air campaign against moderate opposition forces in Syria, the statement said.Highlighting the complexity of the situation in Syria, Turkey over the weekend shelled positions held by a Kurdish militia that is backed by the United States in northern Syria. Turkeys state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish artillery units fired at Kurdish fighters in the Syrian town of Azaz in Aleppo Province, saying it was in response to incoming Kurdish fire, The Associated Press reported.On Saturday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France rejected a German proposal for a quota system for distributing refugees in Europe.Discussion at the conference on Sunday focused on the plan to cease hostilities in Syria within a week and recriminations about the failure of the Obama administration, and others, to have intervened more forcefully or to have anticipated the spreading turmoil.Mr. McCain, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, said on Sunday he wished he could regard the truce plan as a breakthrough. More likely, he said, it was a move that permits the assault on Aleppo to continue for another week, thus locking in Russian military superiority and allowing the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to take back more territory from rebels.Mr. McCain, who traditionally heads the congressional delegation to Munich each year, suggested that Mr. Putin was relying on ever more powerful shows of force to reassert his countrys role as a dominant global power. His appetite is growing with the eating, Mr. McCain said, adding, We have seen this movie before in Ukraine.Mr. Rttgen was also strongly critical of Russia. He urged Western powers to learn from events in Syria, particularly in regard to Europes security. He said that more needed to be spent on defense and that Europe, while still needing the United States, should not rely on America for its safety.Russia has gained the upper hand in the region, and this is, by historical measure, a novelty, Mr. Rttgen said. They have done so by the use of armed force.Other speakers at the conference singled out the Obama administration for failing to act in 2013 after Mr. Obama said the use of chemical weapons by Mr. Assad would cross a red line that demanded American action.Back then, Russia again intervened, using its influence to get Mr. Assad to agree to put all chemical weapons under United Nations supervision for removal and destruction. Mr. McCain said that that move had destroyed Washingtons credibility, particularly with Saudi Arabia, who he claimed had planes ready to fly air raids on Syria when Mr. Obama accepted the Russian-backed plan on chemical weapons."}
{"text": "Vincent Perriard  has been chief executive of the Swiss watch brand HYT (Hydro Mechanical Horologists) since it was founded in 2012.Q. What is your family background?A. I was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, into a very traditional family. My mother was a homemaker and raised three boys. My father was a surgeon.Q. Did you have an entrepreneurial streak as a child?A. Not at all. As a teenager, music was very important to me. My first real job  one with a paycheck  was at a Swiss radio station. I worked as a DJ from age 12 to 23. In fact, with a couple of friends, we founded two small radio stations at the time. By age 21, I realized I would never be able to make a serious living and support a family as a DJ. But I had no clear idea what to do.Q. Was education important in your career?A. To be honest, I was always a bad student. My goal from the outset was to work and get hands-on experience. I did not attend a formal university after high school. Instead, I signed up for a training program at a Swiss business school. Not a prestigious program, more of a practical degree for those looking, for instance, for a basic job in banking.After completing that program, I took a job at Trimedia, an advertising company. I was intrigued by the advertising world and decided to try that path. They offered me a poorly paid internship in New York for a year. I sold my car and everything else I owned in Switzerland and accepted the internship. It was a great experience.I never thought that education would bring much to me. Not having impressive diplomas has never been a problem. Of course, a good rsum is important, but my personal strength has always been in the face-to-face interview. That is where you can project your passion and energy.Q. At 46, you are a young chief executive, but this is your fourth time around in that role.A. I actually feel quite old. The first time I was C.E.O. was at Brand DNA, a company I founded in 2000 with two partners. I was 31 then, and managing 15 people.Later, in the watch industry, I held different positions, and became C.E.O. of the Concord brand at age 37. That brand had completely faded out and I took it over with a team of six and rebuilt it from scratch. After that, I became C.E.O. of TechnoMarine, another watch brand, in 2009. In 2012, I took my current job at HYT. I manage 44 employees in Switzerland and Singapore.Q. How did you land your current position?A. In 2010, the three founding investors of HYT were looking for a C.E.O. They were from different backgrounds, medical, automobile and finance, and none of them was familiar with the watch industry. Their idea was to create a watch brand whose concept was to integrate liquids into mechanical watches.It sounds like a completely paradoxical notion but, as it turned out, while at Concord I had experimented with the crazy idea of liquids and mechanics in a watch. The C1 Gravity Tourbillon was a model in which we had encapsulated a liquid to display the power reserve. That model had won the top design prize at the Grand Prix dHorlogerie de Genve in 2008. The HYT investors noticed my profile. Suddenly, I was sexy to their eyes.Q. It sounds like you have taken paths that have opened up for you rather than traced them deliberately yourself.A. That is absolutely the case. Instinct has guided me, mostly. I never had a specific career target. But I have also never shied away from risk. My motto has been, if you think it is the right idea, go for it. That has always worked for me.Q. With HYT, have you stepped into unknown territory?A. It is unknown territory for our team every day. That can be very exhausting. There are days when I think I would prefer to manage a conventional watch brand that makes purely mechanical movements. I would know what to expect. But when innovation is the DNA of your brand, you have a different responsibility, and that is to come up with new ideas constantly. The biggest thing that motivates me is making the competition irrelevant. I love that we strive to be different in concept, design and marketing.Q. Does that explain why the word most often associated with you is disruptive?A. Disruptive is a word I love. I actually associate it with that extraordinary advertising man, Jean-Marie Dru, who came up with the concept in advertising and branding. Disruption is about doing something completely unexpected. Drus book on the subject has had a great influence on my vision in the business world.I try to be the same way in life. In fact, I am launching a new radio station this year with a group of friends. It is purely passion-driven. Some may even say it is completely disruptive.Q. How do you reconcile being C.E.O. of a young company and the father of five boys?A. This may sound old fashioned, but it is all about teamwork. Family is my first priority. My youngest, a set of twins, are only three years old. During the week, I typically work 14- to 15-hour days. When I get home, I spend a little time with my family and usually work late into the night. But I dont work on weekends. That is sacred family time, unless I am traveling.Managing work and family is a question of organization for my wife and me. Family is like a team, everyone must be happy for it to work.Q. Whats the best advice you have ever received?A. Nicolas Hayek, the chairman of the Swatch Group, told me something about 25 years ago that I did not quite comprehend then. He said there are three important things when managing a brand: the product, the product and the product. A marketing strategy or advertising campaign can only create a context, but what is crucial is for the product to be outstanding. Only now do I understand what he meant.Q. What is the difference between a good leader and a great leader?A. A great leader stands out because of natural charisma. There are many good leaders with great rsums and sharp minds, but to be a great leader, you need charisma and superior emotional intelligence.Q. What advice would you give a young person?A. Younger people are too concerned with getting the right first job and building a rsum. When you are young, you must travel the world, discover different cultures, try new things and make mistakes. Life passes quickly; it is best to make your mistakes early on. My advice would be not to linger in the same job for very long. Do not see your rsum as the end-all and be-all of your career. Go, change, move!"}

(Anybody down here? one asks. Nobody but the F.B.I.s most unwanted, Scully says, mimicking what Mulder said to her in the series pilot.) Agent Einstein (I claim a distant relation) is a redhead, a doctor and a natural skeptic; her partner, Agent Miller, is a chiseled believer in otherworldly methods. I feel like weve seen these two before.Unfortunately, Agent Einstein (Lauren Ambrose of Six Feet Under) is rude, impatient, disrespectful, and not worthy of a younger Scully. As Agent Miller, Robbie Amell (cousin of Stephen, who plays Arrow on the CW show) just didnt read as old enough to be playing in the big leagues. The two dont inspire much confidence in the government, but then again, thats not the point of The X-Files.But Scully sees something in Miller and travels to Texas to help him communicate with his comatose suspect. Her motivation is personal, informed by her mothers recent death. Scully seems to appreciate Millers empathy for the young bomber. Shes as patient with him as she is with Mulder, and other than being obviously reminiscent of her partner, he also reminds her of the son she misses.Honky Tonk BadonkadonkI knew Mulders subconscious was a scary place, but man, it was more frightening than I could ever have imagined.Its not filled with extraterrestrials, though. Its filled with extra neon. The saucy dream sequence that Mulder has in Texas when he thinks hes on magic mushrooms moves from the groovy line-dancing of Billy Ray Cyruss Achy Breaky Heart to a re-enactment of Trace Adkinss video for Honky Tonk Badonkadonk. Mulders crew is less redneck and more geek squad, with Skinner in a cowboy hat and a bolo tie and the Lone Gunmen in their finest Western attire. As the music fades, we find Mulder on a boat, crossing the River Styx and being whipped by the Smoking Man.There was much speculation as to how the Gunmen, Langly, Frohike and Byers,  would make an appearance since they sacrificed themselves in Jump the Shark in Season 9 of the show. Still, the entire spectacle was so outrageous that I couldnt look away and, in fact, watched it over and over. Pride prevents me from thinking this was just because David Duchovny is a decent dancer and had his shirt off.But this fantasy was more than just a peek into Mulders mind and his apparent love of country music. It gave Mulder the key to unlock the mystery behind a terrorist cell. Once again, his empathy shined through and led him to the answers everyone was seeking.Something that I have come to like about these episodes is how loose Mulder (and by extension, Duchovny) is. One of the great things about growing older is that you can become absolutely comfortable in your skin. I am reminded of the Eminem/Rihanna song The Monster  Im friends with the monster thats under my bed/Get along with the voices inside of my head. Mulder has gotten there, maybe because Mr. Duchovny has gotten there, too.What the P.D.A.?Mulder has heard the herald of the end times and so have we. Its been a very quick five weeks, and Mulder and Scully have done a lot together, but they havent had a chance to be just lovebirds.As this episode comes to a close, we find them walking hand in hand and looking lovingly into each others eyes, talking about the things youd imagine them talking about, suicide bombers, mother love. There was no kiss, but my heart was going pitter-pat regardless. Its a small happy ending, a rare thing for the show.And how are you doing as we come to the last episode in this mini-series? Are you ready for a final finale? Or do you want more? Tell us in the comments below."}
{"text": "In the hours after she learned about the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday, Hillary Clinton intended to confine her response to a 79-word statement extending thoughts and prayers to his family and praising his energy and passion on the bench.Then a declaration by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, that the vacancy should not be filled until after President Obama leaves office gained publicity. Mr. Obama vowed to nominate a successor anyway. And in the Republican presidential debate Saturday night, Donald J. Trump  echoed by Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  urged Mr. McConnell on, saying, Delay, delay, delay.Mrs. Clinton, appalled by the Republican response and about to speak at a Democratic dinner in Denver, quickly consulted with aides accompanying her and others back in Brooklyn. In the space of three rushed minutes, she reworked her remarks to call Mr. McConnells gambit totally out of step with our history and our constitutional principle.An already unpredictable election pitting grass-roots activists on the left and right, unenthusiastic or flabbergasted by their presidential choices, against party leaders is suddenly erupting into a rare battle royal for control of every branch of government: the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court. Mr. McConnells threat to block a confirmation could complicate the re-election chances of Republican senators in swing states.For months, Mrs. Clinton had warned that the stakes were high in this election because of the Supreme Court seats the next president would most likely have to fill. But Justice Scalias death at a West Texas ranch on Saturday, and the instant fight over whether Mr. Obama should name his successor, turned an abstract stump-speech line into an urgent and overriding argument, as candidates in both parties hurried to respond to the seismic shift the vacancy created.Officials said they hoped the vacancy would prompt a sobering moment, causing voters to reconsider their romances with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mr. Trump. For Democrats, it will drive home how instrumental the court has been on health care, same-sex marriage, gun control, voting rights and abortion. For Republicans, who fills the vacancy will determine whether Mr. Obamas legacy can be rolled back or is cemented.What is beyond doubt is that the battle will push the parties farther apart, ensuring that an already rancorous election year becomes even more contentious as Republicans and Democrats alike try to rally their voters by portraying the oppositions approach to the nomination as illegitimate.The future of the court dominated the presidential contest on Sunday, with notable differences among the Republicans in how they sought to exploit the vacancy, as each candidate sought to gain the most benefit heading into Saturdays primary in heavily conservative South Carolina.Jeb Bushs campaign said the vacancy underscored his contention that he is the only candidate prepared for the serious issues the next president will face, and questioned whether Mr. Trump could be relied on to appoint a conservative jurist. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, portraying himself as a voice of reason who could bridge the partisan divide, said he hoped Mr. Obama would refrain from nominating someone but stopped short of urging the Senate to refuse to consider an Obama nominee. And Mr. Rubio, vying for conservative support in South Carolina, said Mr. Obama could nominate whoever he wants but added: Were not moving forward on it. Period.None, however, sought to elevate the importance of Justice Scalias replacement more than Mr. Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas who has portrayed himself as a defender of the Constitution.We ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court, Mr. Cruz, whose campaign planned to weave the issue into advertising, said on NBCs Meet the Press.Mr. Cruz sought to use the vacancy as a political weapon, linking Mr. Trump, his most formidable Republican rival in South Carolina, to Mrs. Clinton. We are one justice away from the Second Amendment being written out of the Constitution altogether, he said. He added that if Mr. Trump were the Republican nominee or Mrs. Clinton were elected president, there would be unlimited abortion on demand.Mr. Trump said he would nominate justices in the mode of Justice Scalia and pointed to two federal appeals court judges, Diane S. Sykes of Wisconsin and William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama.He said he did not intend to focus on the vacancy in his speeches, but he did seize the opportunity to question Mr. Cruzs judgment. Mr. Cruz, he noted, backed the appointments of David H. Souter, the retired justice who was chosen by the first President George Bush and usually sided with the courts liberals, and of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whom President George W. Bush nominated and whose vote upheld the Affordable Care Act.Jeb Bush, on CNN, washed his hands of his fathers choice of Justice Souter, saying it turned out to be an unfortunate pick.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said Republicans calling for delay were flouting what they professed to revere. The Republicans are going to look very, very stupid before the American people when they disrespect the Constitution, Mr. Sanders said in an interview Sunday. These are the people who claim they love the Constitution of the United States.For Mrs. Clinton and her allies, the promise of a battle over Mr. Obamas nominee may reinforce a central argument of her candidacy: that she is the Democrat most capable of winning in November and best suited to work with a Republican-led Congress.If Senate Republicans abdicate their responsibility to confirm a nominee before November, it makes the issue of electability much more important for Democrats, said Representative Steve Israel of New York, a Clinton supporter. It elevates the importance of nominating a Democrat who has the strongest record on issues that matter to general election voters, like gun safety, womens rights and civil rights.But Mr. Sanders said the idea that voters would see Mrs. Clinton as better suited to win in November and do battle with a petulant Republican Congress was quite a stretch, adding, There are people supporting Secretary Clinton who will spin anything for any reason.His advisers used the vacancy to highlight Mr. Sanderss promise to overhaul the campaign finance system. Both he and Mrs. Clinton have vowed to appoint only justices who would overturn the 2010 Citizens United ruling, which allowed for unlimited political contributions. But Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, pointed to Mrs. Clintons support from a super PAC and her acceptance of donations from Wall Street executives.She cannot be trusted to appoint someone to the Supreme Court who will take the issue of campaign finance seriously, he said.But Mr. McConnells vow not to confirm a new justice until a new president is in office  seconded by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee  provided Mrs. Clinton with another opportunity to embrace Mr. Obama, who remains widely popular among Democratic voters, particularly in South Carolina, which holds its Democratic primary on Feb. 27.Barack Obama is the president of the United States until Jan. 20, 2017, Mrs. Clinton said in Denver late Saturday. That is a fact, my friends, whether Republicans like it or not."}
{"text": "HONG KONG  The author of a landmark book documenting the millions of deaths from Chinas Great Famine said on Tuesday that his former employer, the official Xinhua News Agency, had forbidden him from traveling to Harvard University next month to receive an award honoring his courage and integrity.In his 2008 book, Tombstone, the writer, Yang Jisheng, showed how the deaths of 36 million people during the 1958-62 famine, one of the worst man-made disasters in history, were a result of disastrous government policies under Mao. The book, published after Mr. Yang left Xinhua in 2001, is banned in China. He said by telephone from Beijing on Tuesday that officials from the agency had met with him, telling him he was forbidden to travel to Harvard.In December, Mr. Yang, 75, was awarded the Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism by the Nieman Fellows at Harvard, a group of professional journalists spending an academic year at the universitys campus in Cambridge, Mass. The fellows said Mr. Yang was a role model to all who seek to document the dark and difficult struggles of humankind. He had been scheduled to receive the award in person in early March.In China under President Xi Jinping, journalists who stray from the Communist Partys official line are increasingly being muzzled as part of a widespread crackdown on civil society that has led to human rights lawyers and feminists being imprisoned, influential bloggers having their social media accounts deleted and professors being told to limit the use of foreign textbooks.In Mr. Yangs case, he may have fallen victim to new rules on what retired Communist Party cadres can say, and specifying that their public opinions must have a high level of consistency with the Party Central under comrade General Secretary Xi Jinping. As a senior reporter for Chinas government-owned official news service for many decades, Mr. Yang was a longtime party member. But he has also been highly critical of the government, dealing a devastating blow to the official account of the famine and Maos legacy in his book, and speaking out in public forums around the world.Until now, he was allowed to travel internationally to receive accolades for his work. Last year, Mr. Yang went to Sweden to receive the Stieg Larsson prize, an award established in memory of the crime writer and journalist, who died in 2004, and given to people working in his spirit. In 2013, he traveled to the United States to receive the Manhattan Institutes Hayek Prize, named after the economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. There, he delivered a scathing indictment of modern China under the Communists, who he said had created a society in which only the already powerful can acquire wealth.Chinas path to harmony and stability is to reject this system and instead to heed Hayeks call to avoid government coercion, respect individual freedom and allow further economic and political liberalization, Mr. Yang said.Although Mr. Yang said on Tuesday that he had his passport, leaving the country against the wishes of Xinhua, a powerful arm of the government and Communist Party, might jeopardize any plans he might have to publish future works. Calls during working hours to Xinhuas main office in Beijing went unanswered.In a statement Tuesday night, the Nieman Fellows said they still intended to honor Mr. Yang in March. If circumstances change and he is able to visit the Nieman Foundation, we will be honored to welcome him to campus, Hamish Macdonald, who helps to oversee the Lyons Award, wrote in the emailed statement."}
{"text": "Republican senators who are thought most susceptible to a political backlash for blocking any new Supreme Court nominee appear to be shaking off concern and joining the call to wait for the next president to fill the vacancy caused by Antonin Scalias death. And that is just fine with some Democrats.While it might make it harder for Senate Democrats and the White House to force consideration of the eventual nominee, the decision by the vulnerable Republicans sets up the clear contrast that Democrats want in the handful of key races likely to decide Senate control in November.Senator Rob Portman of Ohio joined Republican Senate colleagues Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire in coming out for the delay on Monday. Republicans say they do not believe that getting behind the call to put off the confirmation will be that damaging and that Republican voters will reward them for doing so.Democrats see it very differently. One of their main concerns for months has been how to reproduce the surge of enthusiasm among young and minority voters who helped elect President Obama twice. They view the Republican refusal to consider a nominee with almost a year left in Mr. Obamas tenure as a potent weapon to generate excitement.One top Democratic strategist said the courts threat to climate change proposals would have particular resonance with young voters who can be difficult to spur to the polls.Democrats say an added benefit is that united Republican opposition could reinstate the partys reputation for obstruction after Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, had recorded some success in getting the Senate back to work and passing bipartisan legislation. But those bills pale next to a stalled Supreme Court nominee."}
{"text": "Many of our primate ancestors probably ended up in the bellies of big cats. How else to explain bite marks on the bones of ancient hominins, the apparent gnawing of leopards or other African felines?Big cats still pose a threat to primates. In one study of chimpanzees in Ivory Coast, for example, scientists estimated that each chimp ran a 30 percent risk of being attacked by a leopard every year.A new study suggests that the big cats may be getting some tiny help on the hunt. A parasite infecting the brains of some primates, including perhaps our forebears, may make them less wary.What does the parasite get out of it? A ride into its feline host.The parasite is Toxoplasma gondii, a remarkably successful single-celled organism. An estimated 11 percent of Americans have dormant Toxoplasma cysts in their brains; in some countries, the rate  is as high as 90 percent. Infection with the parasite poses a serious threat to fetuses and to people with compromised immune systems. But the vast majority of those infected appear to show no serious symptoms. Their healthy immune systems keep the parasite in check.Mammals and birds can also be infected. But cats in particular play a crucial part in the life cycle of the parasite: When a cat eats an infected animal, Toxoplasma gondii ends up in its gut. It reproduces there, generating offspring called oocysts that are shed in the cats feces. The oocysts can last for months in the environment, where they can be taken up by new hosts.In the 1990s, scientists discovered that mice and rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii lose their natural fear of cat odors  and in some cases even appear to become attracted to them. It was possible, researchers speculated, that the parasite had evolved an ability to influence the behavior of its rodent hosts, to raise the chances they might be eaten by cats.Subsequent studies have shown that the parasite can change the wiring of fear-related regions of the rat brain. Robert M. Sapolsky, a biologist at Stanford University, said that these findings led many researchers to see Toxoplasma gondii as a parasite exquisitely adapted to rodents. According to this view, he said, Toxo being able to infect a zillion nonrodent species is just some sort of irrelevant evolutionary dead end.Even so, Toxoplasma gondii can cause intriguing changes in our brains as well. In a 2015 study, for example, researchers found that women infected with the parasite are more aggressive than those without it; infected men behave more impulsively than parasite-free men.Clmence Poirotte, an evolutionary biologist at the Center for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology in Montpellier, France, wondered if our understanding of Toxoplasma might be limited by the paltry number of species in which its manipulations had been studied. She and her colleagues decided to focus on chimpanzees, running an experiment on 33 apes at a primate research center in Gabon, nine of which had Toxoplasma infections.Instead of testing the reactions of chimpanzees to the odor of house cats, Ms. Poirotte and her colleagues turned to leopards, their natural predators. A veterinarian at a Gabon zoo supplied them with leopard urine, and they poured drops of it on the fence enclosing the space in which the chimpanzees lived.Stepping back from the fence, the scientists observed the apes to see how they responded. They also ran the same experiment with urine from three species that are not chimpanzees natural predators: humans, lions and tigers.Sometimes, the chimpanzees would approach the fence and investigate the smell; other times, they would ignore it. Ms. Poirotte and her colleagues found that chimpanzees not infected with Toxoplasma investigated the smell of leopard urine less than the smell of humans.Thats the sort of behavior you would expect if the smell of leopard urine alarmed the chimpanzees  a healthy instinct that could keep them out of leopard territory and reduce their chances of getting killed.The Toxoplasma-infected chimpanzees, on the other hand, checked out the leopard urine more often than that of humans, not less. They appeared to have developed the same recklessness observed in Toxoplasma-infected rodents.Its so interesting to see that Toxo seems to have evolved the same manipulation ability in an ape with respect to its natural feline predator, said Dr. Sapolsky, who was not involved in the new study.Other experts were also intrigued by the report. But Michael B. Eisen, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he didnt think it was powerful enough to rule out other explanations for how the chimpanzees behaved.There might be innate differences in how the chimpanzees respond to odors, for example, that have nothing to do with being infected with Toxoplasma. Id have to file this, at best, in the interesting but nowhere near convincing file, Dr. Eisen said.Ms. Poirotte acknowledged that it might be possible to tease apart these different possibilities by testing the chimpanzees before and after being infected with Toxoplasma. That would be a very challenging experiment to set up, however.But the current study provided another piece of evidence that the parasite really was manipulating the chimpanzees. It works only with leopard urine, and not with other felines which arent their natural predator, Ms. Poirotte said.Thats the kind of precision youd expect from a parasite that has evolved a strategy for getting into one particular animal. Its so specific that it suggests its Toxoplasma causing the behavior modification, Ms. Poirotte said.She added that it would be useful now to study Toxoplasmas effects on other primate species. It may even turn out that our primate ancestors were once the primary targets of the parasite.When domesticated cats emerged several thousand years ago, the parasite might have expanded into a new host population that favored rodents rather than primates.It certainly suggests that Toxos behavioral effects in humans may be less of an irrelevant dead end than was always assumed, Dr. Sapolsky said."}

{"text": "I want to protect these men from themselves.Thats how State Representative Mary Lou Marzian of Kentucky explains her decision to introduce House Bill 396, which would require men to get authorization from their spouses  in the form of a signed and dated letter  before getting a prescription for erectile-dysfunction drugs. The bill would also require that any man seeking such drugs swear on a Bible that he would only use them to have sex with his spouse.Of course, Ms. Marzian, a Democrat, knows the bill is unlikely to pass. According to the Courier-Journal, she introduced it in response to recent anti-abortion legislation in Kentucky, including a recently passed bill requiring women to get counseling 24 hours before an abortion. Another bill now before the state Senate would require women seeking abortion to get an ultrasound first, though there is no medical rationale for this requirement.Her bill, Ms. Marzian told WDRB, would let government insert itself into the personal, private decisions of men  since we have already inserted itinto our personal, private decisions of women.Ms. Marzian also plans to introduce a bill requiring prospective gun buyers to talk to victims of gun violence 24 hours before purchasing a firearm. Im just making sure the government is taking care of your safety, she explained.Shes not the first state legislator to make such a move. In December, State Representative Stacey Newman of Missouri, a Democrat, pre-filed a bill for the 2016 legislative session that would require would-be gun buyers to watch a 30-minute video on gun deaths, talk to a doctor about gun risks and meet with two families who have suffered gun violence, among other requirements.Since Missouri holds the rank as one of the strictest abortion regulation states in the country, she said, it is logical we borrow similar restrictions to lower our horrific gun violence rates.Arguments like these have their problems. They risk sending the message that getting an abortion is equivalent to buying a gun. Its possible to imagine a conservative legislator responding with a bill requiring background checks for all women seeking abortions.Still, Ms. Marzian and Ms. Newman have drawn attention to the fact that their colleagues are imposing abortion restrictions on women that are intrusive and unnecessary. Perhaps, Ms. Marzian said, her bill will wake some people up in this state to say, Hey, wait a minute, where are they going with seven abortion bills?"}
{"text": "HOBOKEN, N.J.  With Mayor Bill de Blasio proposing a streetcar line from Brooklyn to Queens, city planners do not have to search far for an example of a similar system to help guide them.Just across the Hudson River, traveling from Bayonne through Jersey City and Hoboken to Weehawken, the thriving Hudson-Bergen Light Rail first opened more than a decade ago and now carries about 46,800 passengers each weekday. With views of the Manhattan skyline and sleek cars that glide over 18 miles, it has become increasingly popular and has spurred development in once-blighted areas of the New Jersey waterfront.On a recent morning, Derrick Ladson, a 32-year-old dance teacher, took the line through Hoboken, looking out the window as snow fell outside.Its so convenient; I love it, Mr. Ladson said. You get a nice view as youre riding into work.After opening an initial seven-mile section in 2000, New Jersey Transit gradually extended the line, completing the most recent station, in Bayonne, in 2011. Despite its name, the system never reached Bergen County. Efforts to extend it farther north have stalled over a lack of funding.The system offers a look at the benefits, and challenges, of creating a modern transit system that blends into the urban streetscape. On Tuesday morning, Mr. de Blasio plans to provide more details about his plans for the streetcar at a news conference in Red Hook, Brooklyn, one of the waterfront neighborhoods through which the route would travel.New York Citys proposal, which is being called the Brooklyn Queens Connector, is part of a wave of attention-grabbing streetcar and light-rail projects across the country that seek to capitalize on both urban revitalization and nostalgia for trolleys. But several projects have faced major delays and cost overruns  most notably, a still-unopened streetcar system in Washington  and other plans have been scrapped.The Brooklyn-to-Queens streetcar, which is expected to cost about $2.5 billion, and the Hudson-Bergen line address the same transit reality: Not everyone needs to travel to Manhattan.The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail shows how a system like this can pay off, said Harris Schechtman, the national transit director for Sam Schwartz Engineering, who worked on a feasibility study for the citys streetcar system.Those who have any questions need to look across the river, Mr. Schechtman said, citing the lines popularity.The New Jersey system cost about $2.2 billion and encountered plenty of obstacles along the way, stirring up opposition from some residents who worried it would harm their neighborhoods appeal and produce unwanted noise.The Brooklyn Queens Connector is likely to face similar resistance over the route and lost parking, said Mayor Steven M. Fulop of Jersey City.There was tremendous pushback from the community, Mr. Fulop said of early hostility to the light rails route along Essex Street in Jersey City. Today, I think the residents there would tell you it was a huge success.So far, criticism of Mr. de Blasios streetcar plan has focused on whether the idea was prompted by developers, not public demand, and whether it is the best use of time and money among the regions many transit needs.In New Jersey, Mr. Fulop and other leaders have called for the light rail to expand north, but officials have not been able to secure federal and state funding, he said. While it was originally supposed to run to Ridgefield, in Bergen County, it currently ends at Tonnelle Avenue in Hudson County.The feasibility study for the Brooklyn-Queens streetcar route, which was paid for by a group that includes real estate interests, recommended what amounted to a hybrid streetcar and light-rail system.Light rail generally has clear separation from streets and longer distances between stops, while streetcars fit in more seamlessly with city traffic. The plan under consideration calls for a streetcar with light-rail features, including more space between stations and a dedicated lane when possible. But the streetcar would move at slower speeds than light rail, at an average of 11.3 miles per hour, according to the mayors office.Hudson-Bergen Light Rail trains can travel at 25 m.p.h. in sections where it merges with traffic and up to 60 m.p.h. in areas where it has an exclusive right of way. In an example of problems that can arise when trains and cars mix, a car backed out of a parking space in Jersey City last week and hit a light-rail vehicle, causing delays along the line. Collisions between trains and cars have raised concerns in other cities, like Houston and Salt Lake City.In Hoboken on a recent evening, Vasko Prasko, 36, said that he had been using the light rail for a decade, as he waited for a train at the Ninth Street station. The cars were nearly empty at first, but now they are packed, said Mr. Prasko, who works as a systems analyst in Jersey City.Its hard to find a seat anymore, its that popular, he said.Casey Glidden, 26, who lives in Jersey City and works in Manhattan, uses the light rail as part of her commute to work and on the weekends to visit friends.Ms. Glidden, standing on a crowded car, said it was easier to take this than to try to figure out a bus schedule or drive.Still, some riders had a few complaints.Tracy Crinion, 44, a marketing consultant who lives in Hoboken, likes taking the light rail to her job in Weehawken, but bemoaned the less reliable service on the weekends. Some friends who live near the route also complain about the trains sounds, Ms. Crinion said.They say no matter how good your windows are, you can hear that bell, she said."}
{"text": "Eugene ONeill had some difficulty settling on a form and a style for the trilogy of plays that would constitute Mourning Becomes Electra, his 1931 adaptation of Aeschylus The Oresteia. He tried verse, he tried masks; he tried abandoning the play entirely and writing a life of Aeschylus instead. The script ultimately blended Greek tragedy with Yankee mythos, Freudian theory with melodrama. Hailed as a masterpiece in its day, it is a lot less popular now.In Drunken With What, Target Margin Theaters somewhat esoteric tribute to the trilogy at Abrons Arts Center, you can see how these inspirations compete and occasionally coalesce. (The title borrows from a Baudelaire quotation that ONeill used in Long Days Journey Into Night.) The companys artistic director, David Herskovits, has shrunk the six-hour playing time to about 100 minutes, mostly by deleting scenes and whittling away at the cast of characters. (Think of this as the opposite of a directors cut.) Four actors  Satya Bhabha, Mary Neufeld, Stephanie Weeks and Eunice Wong, all Target Margin regulars  enact the terrible fate of the Mannon clan.The broad outlines of the plot should rattle the memory of all those who have sat through a college freshman literature survey. Theres also a detailed program synopsis, which many in a matinee audience were reading aloud to one another before the show began. (She kills herself? a woman asked her companion. Ugh!)The Civil War general Ezra Mannon (the Agamemnon stand-in) is killed by his wife, Christine, and her lover, the sea captain Adam Brant, Ezras cousin. When Ezras son, Orin, returns from the war, he and his sister, Lavinia, kill Brant and drive their mother to suicide. Then Orin, tormented by incestuous desire for his sister, kills himself, while the haunted Lavinia, possessed by hate and death, retreats to the shadowed family manse. (The Aeschylus original actually has a much happier ending.)Target Margin uses the deconstructionist tool kit to dismantle the play, with mixed results. The stage is mostly bare, though columns and porticoes occasionally descend from the ceiling. The costumes are a jumble of period and modern; props are few. The acting is occasionally naturalistic, but more often stylized and gestural. Fences relegate the audience to the last three rows of the Abrons orchestra, far from the action. A bank of speakers ensure that the actors dont have to shout, but some exchanges are unamplified and so are barely heard.This approach highlights the variability within the play itself and sometimes speaks to its internal tensions  between the public and the private, hate and love, fate and freedom. But the intellectual playfulness pretty well negates the sense of drama, much less tragedy. The play only makes sense  if it makes sense at all  if inexorable passions, conscious and unconscious, drive these characters. Target Margins cooler method renders much of the action merely silly, a risk even in straightforward productions.Drunken With What wont be Target Margins last swig of ONeill. The company will keep working on Mourning Becomes Electra for at least another year, incorporating skipped scenes and arriving at a full production. Will it be a tragedy? A comedy? A homage? An abstraction? If its anything like the ONeill original, all that and more."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Last spring and summer, huge protests set off by corruption scandals engulfed two Central American nations. In Guatemala, an investigation led by a United Nations-sponsored International Commission Against Impunity exposed a far-reaching customs corruption ring and uncovered evidence that its leader was none other than the countrys president, Otto Prez Molina. Protests in Guatemala City grew, and in September, Mr. Prez Molina resigned and was sent to jail to await trial.In Honduras, protests erupted when a local journalist revealed that millions of dollars of public funds from the countrys health care system had been funneled to the ruling National Party and the election campaign of President Juan Orlando Hernndez. A handful of administrators and business executives have been indicted for other corruption in the health system, but no charges have been brought against Mr. Hernndez or other top party officials over the diversion of funds to the party. Thousands of torch-bearing protesters demanded Mr. Hernndezs resignation and a United Nations-backed commission like Guatemalas.In response, Mr. Hernndez convened a tightly controlled national dialogue, in which many opposition leaders refused to participate, and then proposed a government-sponsored investigative body with no autonomy. When this failed to placate protesters, the Organization of American States stepped in to help design an alternative plan. The result was the Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras.The mission was inaugurated at the O.A.S. headquarters in Washington last month amid much fanfare and a ringing endorsement from the State Department. A department spokesman, John Kirby, said the mission responds to the legitimate demands of the Honduran people for vigorous and meaningful action against corruption.Opponents in Honduras, however, have denounced the plan as toothless and are insisting on an independent, United Nations-backed body  and 54 members of Congress have urged Secretary of State John Kerry to support their demand. A coalition of almost all the countrys human rights groups declared that the new mission was limited in its ability to attack corruption and impunity in the country.Unlike the Guatemalan commission, which has a strong record of fighting organized crime and high-level corruption, the Honduran one wont directly participate in investigations and prosecutions. Instead, its international team of judges and lawyers will merely provide technical support to local investigators and prosecutors who are part of the judiciary and susceptible to political pressure. The mission can make recommendations for reforming the broken justice system, but the government is free to ignore them.Honduras needs help. Its extreme levels of violence, among the highest in the world, go hand in hand with an appalling rate of criminal impunity. The countrys security forces are heavily infiltrated by organized crime  rotten to the core, a former police official told The Miami Herald. Two weeks later, the official was shot dead. Scores of journalists, lawyers, land rights activists, gay rights advocates and opposition figures have been assassinated, without consequence for their killers.Whether the mission can achieve anything will depend on whether there is sufficient political will. There is little cause for optimism: Mr. Hernndez and the National Party have a record of running roughshod over the rule of law.In 2012, as president of Congress, Mr. Hernndez ousted several Supreme Court justices and illegally stacked the bench with his allies. In 2014, his party dissolved a widely respected independent police reform commission without enacting its recommendations. And the Honduran attorney general, Oscar Chinchilla, has so far failed to investigate or prosecute National Party leaders in the diversion of health care funds to party accounts.Sadly, the American government is ill positioned to offer help. In 2009, the State Department under Secretary Hillary Clinton helped a military coup in Honduras succeed by blocking efforts to restore the left-leaning president, Manuel Zelaya, to power. Since then, Washingtons diplomatic efforts have focused on shoring up a series of corrupt post-coup governments. More than 100 members of Congress have called on the Obama administration to condemn human rights violations by security forces, and have questioned Americas security assistance to Honduras.Yet Washington continues to back Mr. Hernndez. At the height of last years protests, the American ambassador to Honduras proclaimed that relations between the United States and Honduras are perhaps the best in history. This year, the United States government has again increased military and police support to Central America, with Honduras receiving a significant percentage of those funds, much of it through the opaque Central America Regional Security Initiative.Given the limits of the anti-corruption missions mandate and the allegations against senior officials involved in carrying out its recommendations, it seems unlikely that this body will overcome the crisis in Honduras. Instead, it seems intended to give a veneer of respectability to Washingtons continued support for the Hernndez regime.Still, the appropriations legislation in Congress for 2016 does provide tools to pressure the Honduran government. It makes half of the assistance to Honduras  amounting to tens of millions of dollars  conditional on State Department certification that the authorities are taking effective steps to combat corruption, cooperate with commissions against impunity, and investigate and prosecute members of military and police forces who are credibly alleged to have violated human rights.But is the State Department willing to take the certification process seriously? This is something many members of Congress have had serious questions about in recent years. Congressional oversight may be the only guarantee that due diligence is done.Protesters will doubtless continue to march through the streets of Tegucigalpa  as they did last month  calling for a more effective United Nations-backed anti-corruption body. If the O.A.S.-sponsored mission fails to deliver results, Mr. Hernndez could get another dose of people power like the one that brought down Guatemalas president."}

Study participants were asked to find red and green objects on a computer screen filled with different colored objects. They received small rewards for finding the objects: $1.50 for the red ones and 25 cents for the green ones.The next day, while brain scans were conducted, participants were asked to find certain shapes on the screen. There was no reward, and color was irrelevant. Still, when a red object appeared, participants focused on it, and scans showed dopamine was released in their brains.They are not getting a reward for that, yet part of the brain is saying, Oh, theres a reward  pay attention to it, said Susan M.

In 2008, 60 Minutes bootstrapped a standard profile tied to a new book into an surprisingly rich video profile. No one is likely to come away from this segment with a different opinion of Scalia, but many viewers might have a better sense of the man Ruth Bader Ginsburg called so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes outrageous  and who called himself something of a shin-kicker.  John SchwartzIn May 1997, Jonathan Levin, a Bronx high school English teacher and the son of then Time Warner chief, Gerald Levin, was brutally murdered in his Manhattan apartment. A year later, his former student, Corey Arthur, was convicted of the murder. At the time, some commentators lamented that the idealistic Mr. Levin had perhaps gotten too close to his students and paid the price. Now nearly 20 years later, the journalist Alexander Nazaryan gets to know Mr. Arthur in prison and questions both the certainty of his conviction and the established narrative of Mr. Levins life and death. Mr. Nazaryan, himself a former English teacher, makes comparisons to Greek tragedy, and in this case, the analogy is truly apt.

{"text": "Dear Hillary, Jeb, Marco and John,You all find yourselves running against a whirlwind. Hillary, for you the whirlwind is Bernie Sanders. For the rest of you its Donald Trump.Either way, youre running against a candidate who generates passionate intensity. At some level those candidates followers must know that theres something wildly impractical about the candidacy they are fervently supporting. Trump has no actual policies and Sanders has little chance of getting his passed.And yet the supporters dont care. Sanders and Trump make them feel known. Finally, somebody is saying what they feel. Finally, somebody is outraged by the things that outrage them. Theres a deep passion embedded in the Trump and Sanders phenomena, arousing energy, magical thinking and some suspension of disbelief.And the rest of you are basically asking voters to snap out of it. All of you, but especially you, Hillary, are asking voters to calm down and be pragmatic: Consider electability! Vote for the one who can get laws passed!And its not working. In debates Sanders is uninhibited by the constraints of reality, so his answers are always bolder. Trump speaks from the id, not from any policy paper, so his answers are always more vivid.The brute fact is you cant beat passion with pragmatism. The human heart is not built that way. You cant beat angry passion with bloodless calculation. If youre going to have any chance against these hotheads, you have to set a rival and stronger emotional tone. Id ask you to think of the ancient ideal of comradeship.Many Americans feel like they are the victims of a slow-moving natural disaster. Sanders and Trump try to put the blame for this disaster on discrete groups of people  Wall Street or immigrants. But in reality its a natural disaster caused by structural forces  globalization, technological change, the dissolution of the family, racism.A great nation doesnt divide in times of natural disaster. It doesnt choose leaders who angrily tear it apart. Instead, it chooses leaders like Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, leaders who radiate sunny confidence, joy and neighborliness.You may think of neighborliness as a sentimental, soft virtue. And I suppose in times of peace, prosperity and ease it is a sweet and tender thing.But look at what happens to neighbors when one friend is threatened or when times are hard. Then neighborliness takes on a different hue. Friends become comrades in arms.That is what F.D.R. and Ike were able to do with their leadership styles. With fireside chats and golf jokes, they were neighborly even in times of great difficulty and stress. But they were also able to set an emotional tone that brought people together and changed the nature of Americans relationships with one another.During their presidencies, the bonds of solidarity grew stronger and the country more formidable. They were able to cultivate a deep sense of unity, responsibility and sacrifice. They didnt call for sacrifice as something painful, but as what one did for ones friends.Id love to see one of you counter the Trump and Sanders emotional tones with a bold shift in psychology. This would be a shift toward the cheerful resolve of an F.D.R. or an Eisenhower.Let Trump and Sanders shout, harangue and lecture. You respond to difficulty with warmth, confidence and optimism.Let them deliver long, repetitive and uninterrupted lectures. You converse, interact, chat and listen.Let them stand angry and solitary. You run as part of a team, a band of brothers, with diverse advisers and buddies joining you onstage at event after event.Let them assert that all our problems can be solved if other people sacrifice  the immigrants or the top 1 percent. You call for shared sacrifice. The rich can give more in taxes, but the rich, the middle class and the poor can all give more in civic engagement.Let them emphasize the cold relations of business (Trump) or of the state (Sanders). You emphasize the warm bonds of neighbor helping neighbor. While they dwell in the land of impersonal bureaucracies, you point out that the primary task before us to repair the social fabric  the basic respect diverse Americans have for one another.Let them preach pessimism. You emphasize a warm nationalism  a basic confidence that America is not going down in decline, that it is still the nation best positioned to dominate the 21st century, that confidence is a better guide than anger or fear.Sanders and Trump have adopted emotional tones that are going to offend and exhaust people over time. Watching the G.O.P. South Carolina debate I got the impression that Trumps exhaustion moment is at hand.The candidate who has the audacity to change the emotional tone of this whole election will win the White House and have a shot at rebinding the civic fabric of this nation."}
{"text": "Leave it to Lionel Messi to turn a straightforward penalty kick into a breathtaking moment.With Barcelona up, 3-1, on Celta Vigo on Sunday night, Messi stepped up to take a penalty. But instead of blasting the ball to the net, he tapped it softly to the right. With the goalkeeper flummoxed, an onrushing Luis Surez punched it in.Needless to say, Twitter users were excited. Most of the reaction was of the did-you-see-that variety, but some felt Messi was being disrespectful to the beaten Celta side.Coach Luis Enrique defended the goal to reporters: There will be those who like it and those who dont, he said. As well as winning titles, here we try to entertain people and win in a spectacular and sporting manner.Though the plan seemed to go like clockwork, Neymar claimed afterward that he was the player who was supposed to score the goal, not Surez.It was for me; we had practiced it in training, he said, according to The Independent. Leo and myself had practiced, but Luis was closer and he scored it.While the play was amazing, the great Johan Cruyff actually went one better in 1982 for Ajax. Like Messi, he sidefooted the penalty to a teammate, Jesper Olsen. The keeper committed to stopping Olsen, who then returned it to Cruyff, who tapped it into the empty net.A somewhat more common penalty trick is the Panenka, developed in the 1970s by the player it is named for, the Czech player Antonn Panenka. Taking advantage of the goalies tendency to lunge aggressively to the left or right, the shooter makes a soft kick with a slight loft and puts the ball in the center of the net.Heres Messi  who else?  executing it to perfection last spring.Before you try a Panenka of your own in a pickup game, be aware that when one goes wrong, it goes badly, badly wrong:Messi may be the worlds greatest player, but not every penalty trick he tries goes right. Here, he illegally stutter-steps before the kick, drawing a yellow card.Theyab Awana of the U.A.E., who died in a car accident at 21, once converted an audacious penalty that makes Messis trickery seem staid. In an international game against Lebanon in 2011, he turned around and kicked the ball like a mule. It went directly in as the keeper watched in wonder.There have been numerous great penalty saves over the years, but you may not have seen this one. Jol Mall of Aarau in the Swiss League pulls off a stunning double save in 2014, and still needs a superhuman effort from defender Igor NGanga to keep the ball out of the net.The most memorable penalties are often the bad misses. Here is one from 2012 that Jonathan Soriano of Red Bull Salzburg would rather forget. Yikes."}

{"text": "She heard the screams in Polish coming from somewhere nearby  Fire! Fire!  and immediately thought of the two young women living next door, asleep on a frigid Sunday night.The woman, Ewa Leoczak, a Polish home health aide who had been living on the second floor of her Greenpoint, Brooklyn, walk-up for a year, opened the door to her hallway and found it choked with smoke. Wading through the blackness, she pounded on the door of her neighbors, who were also Polish.I scream, because they were sleeping, Go away! Ms. Leoczak, 50, said. She waited long enough to hear their footsteps coming down the hall, and then plunged into the smoke clogging the steep staircase. The light went out; we couldnt see each other, Ms. Leoczak said. She remembered the layout well enough to feel her way down. She added, I was with angel probably.Ms. Leoczak recalled those moments of blindness and the frantic escape on Monday afternoon, standing beside the two women outside the charred remains of their apartments at 49 Diamond Street. Her hands were blistered and blackened and her voice was a raspy from shouting and breathing smoke. She was still in the gray sweatpants she wore when she fled.The fire broke out around 10:20 p.m. on Sunday, the Fire Department said, turning a quiet block of rowhouses into a corridor of blaring sirens and bright orange tongues of fire lapping from the roof and windows of 49 Diamond and spreading to the two adjacent buildings. By the time the fire was under control, at 1:28 a.m. on Monday, with temperatures hovering in the low teens, 168 firefighters had been called to the scene and the street was frozen over from the spray of their hoses.Two firefighters sustained minor injuries and were treated at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center. Two civilians, including Ms. Leoczak, also had minor injuries and were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center.The blaze started in Ms. Leoczaks three-story building but quickly spread to 47 and 51 Diamond Street, fire officials said. Fire marshals were still investigating the cause on Monday.The American Red Cross said it had registered 14 residents displaced by the fire, offering them emergency housing, food, blankets and medical aid. They were among 120 people the charity said it had given emergency assistance since Friday morning in a string of 42 home fires in the New York area, an unusually high number.Another home fire earlier on Sunday in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, killed a 30-year-old woman, Shanika Robinson, the police said.In Greenpoint, Jessica Panek heard a blast on Diamond Street, one block behind her home on Newell Street, just as the fire erupted.It sounded like a bomb, Ms. Panek, 21, said. My mom said, Were under attack!Nearby, Christine Counihan, 68, heard a similar sound, but by the time she looked outside to check, everywhere was smoke.A neighbors photos showed a fire engine arriving at 10:25 p.m., as black smoke billowed from the top of the building. A frame at 10:36 p.m. showed a ribbon of fire streaming from a top-floor window. A photo at 10:41 p.m. showed firefighters on a ladder, aiming hoses at tall flames that had blasted through the roof of the building.Tomasz Pustelny, 26, a construction worker, was visiting his girlfriend at 45 Diamond Street, two doors down from where the fire started, when he heard the shouts. They grabbed her familys laptops, worried about losing all their photos and documents, and ran outside to a parked car, where he, his girlfriend and his girlfriends mother stayed through the night. They watched firefighters climb to their roof and spray water on the collapsing, burning structures next door.Firemen were going inside the middle building looking for people, Mr. Pustelny said.Firefighters let him and his girlfriends family back into their home in the early morning  it was not damaged  but he said he had continued to hear their footsteps on the roof.Ms. Leoczak and her two neighbors, though, had not been so lucky. Their building was gutted and the vinyl siding was peeling away. Surveying their losses on Monday, Ms. Leoczak put her arms around the two young women, who declined to give their names, and said only that the experience had been terrifying.After they had fled the fire, she and the two women were taken into the home of another neighbor, Greg Colic, 43, and given warm clothes by his mother.You dont think about it  you just do it, Mr. Colic said. All they had were the clothes on their backs, mainly PJs.Ms. Leoczaks voice had sounded so awful that Mr. Colic tracked down a police officer, who asked an emergency medical worker to take her to the hospital. She was told she had smoke inhalation. Hours later, she still struggled to talk through the pain in her throat.We lost everything, Ms. Leoczak said. I am still in shock."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  A judge in California on Tuesday ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the assault in San Bernardino that killed 14 people in December.The ruling handed the F.B.I. a potentially important victory in its long-running battle with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies over the governments ability to get access to encrypted data in investigations. Apple has maintained that requiring it to provide the keys to its technology would compromise the security of the information of hundreds of millions of users.The F.B.I. says that its experts have been unable to get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed by the police along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, after they attacked Mr. Farooks co-workers at a holiday gathering.Prosecutors said in a court filing that Apple had the exclusive means to bypass the security features on the phone, but that the company had declined to provide that assistance voluntarily. F.B.I. experts say that because of the phones security features, they risk losing the data permanently after 10 failed attempts to enter the password.The Justice Department had secured a search warrant for the phone, which is owned by Mr. Farooks former employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. But prosecutors said they saw little choice but to seek the additional order compelling Apples assistance.In an unusually detailed directive, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the District of Central California ordered Apple to provide reasonable technical assistance to the F.B.I. in unlocking the phone. That assistance should allow investigators to bypass or erase the auto-erase function on the phone, among other steps, she wrote.In a statement, Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, said the company would oppose the order and resist efforts to provide a back door to the iPhone, and he called the implications of the governments demands chilling.For many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers personal data because we believe its the only way to keep their information safe, the company said in the statement. We have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.Prosecutors said the contents of the phone could provide crucial evidence about the attackers communications and contacts before the shooting.The husband and wife appear to have been motivated by a devotion to violent jihad, but the authorities have not connected them publicly to any extremists overseas. Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor, has been charged with providing them with the assault weapons used in the attack and conspiring with Mr. Farook in an earlier plot that was not carried out.Eileen M. Decker, the United States attorney in Los Angeles, where the investigation is being handled, said the effort to compel Apples technical cooperation marked another step  a potentially important step  in the process of learning everything we possibly can about the attack in San Bernardino.Prosecutors have made a solemn commitment to the victims and their families that we will leave no stone unturned as we gather as much information and evidence as possible, Ms. Decker said.James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, has been at odds with Apple and other technology companies for months over whether they should provide de-encryption technology for their products. Without it, he has argued, the bureau is at risk of going dark in its investigations. The Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and most of the Republican hopefuls support Mr. Comeys stance.Apple and other technology companies say that creating an opening in their products for government investigators would also create a vulnerability that Chinese, Iranian, Russian or North Korean hackers could exploit.Apple, arguing in December against a British proposal that could force it to provide the government with a way into iPhone communications, said the dispute should not be seen as an all-or-nothing proposition for law enforcement.Nothing could be further from the truth, Apple argued. Law enforcement today has access to more data  data which they can use to prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes and help bring perpetrators to justice  than ever before in the history of our world.Apple said that we believe it would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat."}
{"text": "TUNUYN, Argentina  The view from Bodega Catena Zapatas Adrianna Vineyard, almost 5,000 feet high in the Uco Valley south of Mendoza, is nothing short of magnificent.The snow-frosted Andes command the western sky, looming above the vineyard like a prone Gulliver clad in white before a valley of Lilliputians. A current of wind flows ceaselessly off the mountains, rustling the leaves of the grapevines like a gurgling river.With difficulty, I turned my gaze down into a calicata, a test pit dug into the earth between rows of chardonnay vines. It revealed layers of pale beige limestone soil interspersed with large, smooth white rocks. Nearby was another pit, but the soil in it was completely different: chalky limestone infused with nothing larger than pebbles. Across the row was yet another pit, with no limestone, just loamy loess.Wines produced from each of these soils are just as different. Catenas 2012 White Bones chardonnay, from the chalky soil, is dry and citrusy, with aromas and flavors of minerals and herbs. A 2012 White Stones chardonnay, from the rockier soil, is higher toned and more herbal, with tangy, succulent flavors and more intense minerality. And the grapes from the loamier soils go into Catena Alta chardonnay, which has fine acidity but is fruitier and less mineral.Among wine drinkers, Argentina is known above all for malbec. This friendly red, most often in a rich style dominated by flavors of jammy fruit and oak, has become almost a generic brand, the red wine equivalent of pinot grigio. In bars and restaurants all over the United States, consumers seeking an anonymous red wine ask for a glass of malbec.But a significant segment of the wine-drinking population has no use for malbec and, by extension, for Argentina.These are consumers on the leading edge, who have prompted new interest in wines of finesse and harmony. They have spearheaded re-examinations of grapes once considered too obscure and regions that had been roundly dismissed. They prize wines that express terroir. For them, Argentine malbec may just as well be Australian shiraz.Yet just as Australia has been stereotyped, perhaps unfairly, as a source of only heavy, fruity wines, so has Argentina been typed by the popular style of malbec. Though most of the wine from the Mendoza region, the center of Argentine malbec production, continues to be made in this fruity style, a growing number of producers are trying to move beyond the jam to make wines that explore the nuances of Mendoza terroir.Some are looking to make better, finer malbec. Others are looking to different grapes like chenin blanc, cabernet franc, pinot noir and chardonnay. Some producers, like Catena Zapata, are doing both.And so all over Mendoza, as I discovered on a trip here in December, vineyards are dotted with these calicatas, soil pits dug partly to educate visitors, perhaps, but also to educate the winemakers themselves, who for so long cared more about ease of farming and quantity of production than the quality of the wines or the particularity of terroirs. Its easy to imagine Cistercian monks doing something similar as they cataloged the terroirs of Burgundy 500 years ago.The process has been a challenge because the soils of Mendoza are incredibly complicated. In the Adrianna Vineyard, and in many other places, the soils change radically from one row of vines to the next, sometimes over a matter of meters.The geology of Mendoza was shaped eons ago, when an ancient ocean covered the territory from Patagonia to Peru, leaving behind rich deposits of limestone. Over countless millenniums, rivers from the Andes deposited rocks and silt, leaving deep clay soils, stones and gravel in many varying combinations.You still have pure limestone in the Andes, and slender veins extend into Mendoza, said Pedro Parra, a geologist from Chile who specializes in terroir and is a partner in Altos Las Hormigas, a Mendoza producer intent on making terroir-expressive wines. You can have pure limestone in one spot, but a few meters to the left, none.For Mr. Parra and his colleagues, limestone is the holy grail, the fount from which the prize quality of minerality flows. He has relentlessly sought it out in Mendoza, digging pits, analyzing soil samples, correlating his discoveries with what he tastes in the wines.The differences can be astonishing. Pulenta Estate, an excellent producer in Lujn de Cuyo, the region just outside the city of Mendoza where a good many wineries are, has a vineyard primarily of sand, gravel and clay. It also has a vineyard in the Uco Valley to the south with rocky limestone deposits.The malbec from the vineyard in Lujn de Cuyo is pleasantly fruity and velvety soft. The malbec from the Uco Valley is structured and tannic, with fruit threaded through with aromas and flavors of graphite. Pulenta blends the two to make its estate malbec, but I prefer the Uco Valley solo.Indeed, the malbecs I tasted from Mendoza from clay soils, especially if the clay was highly irrigated and fertilized, were dark, sweet, fruity and high in alcohol. They were sadly familiar. Those from rockier soils, often with some limestone, tended to be more structured, precise and nuanced.Mr. Parra takes a Manichaean view of terroir.Its a fight between rocks and clay, he said, standing in a soil pit in an Uco Valley vineyard between the towns of La Consulta and Eugenio Bustos. Clay equals monster wines. Rocks equal vertical, structured wines. You either like clay-style wines or limestone-style wines.For Catena Zapata, its never been that simple. Nicols Catena, who took over the family winery in the 1960s, pioneered the movement toward higher-altitude vineyards in the 1980s and 1990s after he became convinced that his wines could achieve grace and finesse only if made in cooler climates than the familys warmer lower-elevation vineyards nearer to the city of Mendoza. Only after planting the Adrianna Vineyard, the highest of Catena Zapatas vineyards in the Uco Valley, did the winery begin to analyze the complexity of its soils.In 1995, Mr. Catenas daughter Laura Catena created the Catena Institute, a research and development arm, which pays special attention to Adrianna. Ms. Catena, who is now the general director of Catena Zapata, believes that the soils are only part of the formula for making graceful, nuanced wine, along with the cool, dry, fresh climate at high altitude and the quality of the light.We need both elements to make wines such as those from Adrianna: cool climate and special soils, she said.As crucial as terroir may be, the best producers are taking steps to make sure it shines through. Many Mendoza producers still rely far too much on new oak barrels to impart flavor and structure to their wines, but producers like Catena Zapata, Altos Las Hormigas, Pulenta and Mendel have made a conscious effort to rein in the use of oak.Catena Zapatas two high-end Adrianna Vineyard chardonnays are excellent examples: pristine, nuanced wines. The winery also makes a fresh, floral, beautifully balanced Adrianna malbec with the curious name Mundus Bacillus Terrae, after a type of mold found only in certain parts of the vineyard.Pulenta Estate, whose winemaker, Javier Lo Forte, said he was aiming to make wines of complexity, finesse and drinkability, makes a terrific, spicy, peppery cabernet franc that fulfills each goal. Pulenta also makes a fresh, tart sauvignon blanc, a savory chardonnay and a deep, structured Gran Malbec.The malbecs of Altos Las Hormigas, from a range of different vineyards, have become progressively less oaky, more refined and mineral-flavored since 2011.Mendel, in Lujn de Cuyo alongside an 80-year-old malbec and cabernet vineyard, additionally farms an old vineyard in the Uco Valley, Finca Remota, from which it makes a deep, textured, mineral smillon. It also produces a fine, balanced malbec; a structured, mineral cabernet sauvignon; and Unus, a blend of cabernet, malbec and petit verdot that is formidably concentrated and tannic. None of the wines are oaky.In restaurants in Mendoza and Buenos Aires, I found other producers aiming for more balanced wines, producers whom I will keep an eye out for in New York. Among the wines were a crisp, inviting chenin blanc from Gen del Alma, a light yet nuanced Eggo cabernet franc from Zorzal and another deliciously drinkable cabernet franc from Micheliniwine.Perhaps not coincidentally, each of these wines was from the Michelinis, three brothers who in various combinations are making wines that would be embraced in the hippest natural wine bars of New York.The Micheliniwine cabernet franc comes from the Tupungato Winelands, an unusual project in the Uco Valley that combines high-end residences in a country-club atmosphere with golf, polo (an Argentine obsession) and private vineyards.Driving through the vineyard area, Mr. Parra, the geologist, pointed out that the flat areas in the wine lands, mostly clay and alluvial soils, were well planted with vines, but that the steep slopes, made up of rocky, sandy limestone, were bare.The tradition is planting on the flats, but the grand cru is on these gorgeous slopes, which are completely unplanted, he lamented. Maybe that will be the future, Argentina 2020."}
{"text": "Nat Wolff arrives at Joe Allen, the Midtown restaurant thats served as a hangout for off-duty actors for over 50 years, with a gash on his finger. The 21-year-old is currently starring in a revival of Sam Shepards 1978 Pulitzer Prize-winning play Buried Child at the Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theatre, and at the previous nights performance  during a scene in which his character, Vince, violently hurls glass bottles against a wall  he looked down to find a pool of blood at his feet. To many, Wolff is best known for his roles as a teenager blinded by cancer in The Fault in Our Stars and as the lead opposite Cara Delevingne in last summers Paper Towns, both adaptations of John Green novels. By contrast, Shepards drama, about three generations of a Midwestern family coming to grips with an economic depression and personal tragedy, marks a step up in intensity. I insisted when we started that we use real glass in the play, Wolff says, examining his hand. But now Im not so sure.Wolff grew up near Washington Square Park in Manhattan, a stones throw from NYU and the legendary Cherry Lane Theatre. His father, a jazz pianist, was for a time the bandleader for The Arsenio Hall Show, and his mother, the actress Polly Draper of Thirtysomething fame, starred in a production of Buried Child at Yale Repertory Theatre when she was her sons age. (Wolff says he can remember stories his mother used to tell about doing the play with her friend and co-star, Tony Shalhoub.) I was kind of under the illusion that everyone was some kind of artist, Wolff says of his Greenwich Village upbringing, which often involved outings to see his parents perform. When he was eight, Wolff caught the acting bug and appeared in his first play at the tiny Flea Theater in Tribeca  a formative experience that sealed his love for the trade. I got to see a completely naked 25-year-old girl walk past me to go on to the stage, and I just thought, This is it.The young actor experienced his first real taste of success just a year later, when he and his brother, Alex  three years his junior  starred in the musical-comedy film, The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie, written and directed by Draper. Inspired by a real band that Wolff formed when he was just in preschool (he started writing songs at age five), the film was soon turned into a series for Nickelodeon. The brothers became preteen sensations, charting a single on the Billboard 200 and playing gigs at the Manhattan concert venues Irving Plaza (then the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza) and the Nuyorican Poets Caf. Wed finish a set and there would be poets with clown makeup coming on right after us, Wolff says of the decidedly older crowd that visited the East Village space.As the brothers own audience grew, even the most routine of events, like attending a school basketball game, could devolve into a mob scene. In the end, it took a universal teenage experience to bring the elder Wolff back down to earth: puberty. When I turned 13, I grew six inches and my face changed drastically, he says. I had a real awkward two or three years when people stopped recognizing me. He credits his parents, who experienced their own ups and downs with fame, with preparing him for the potential fallout. For Alex and I, the real joy comes from the doing of the thing, and thats because of our parents saying thats how its going to be, or its not going to be at all, Wolff says. As for his postpubescent disappearance: It was good for me to figure out on my own that that stuff is completely transient.These days, being recognized is less of a problem. Wolff grew a beard for his role in Buried Child  a nice, patchy, dorky thing  and despite the increased attention he got for Paper Towns, he says that people in New York mostly leave him alone. Except for his parents, of course: I think theyd like to come see the show as much as possible, but theres also only so many times you can sit through a play that upsetting. That goes double for his fans, who  despite turning out in larger numbers for The Fault in Our Stars than, say, his turn as a deeply troubled stoner in Gia Coppolas 2014 drama, Palo Alto  are learning to grow with him. I saw a 13-year-old girl at the show the other day and asked her how she liked it, he says, laughing. And she just said, That was pretty crazy."}
{"text": "In a country where 40 million people owe upward of $1.2 trillion on their student loans, its not hard to imagine why a tale about armed federal agents showing up at the door of a Texas man to arrest him over unpaid student loans set the Internet abuzz.But as is the case with many stories that are shared widely online, the truth is a bit more complicated: Mainly, the authorities said the Houston resident, Paul Aker, was arrested after he disregarded years of orders to appear in court and address the repayment of a student loan from almost three decades ago.When United States Marshals finally made contact with him last Thursday, officials said he threatened two deputies.So for the millions of Americans who may worry that the authorities will show up with handcuffs to collect old student debt, Mr. Akers arrest is hardly typical  as long as you respond to the governments requests to pay up.Mr. Aker appeared on  a Houston-area Fox affiliate on Monday to tell how seven deputy marshals visited his home with guns.Mr. Aker said he initially had no idea why the marshals were at his door. He said he had heard nothing about the loan for almost 30 years.Im home, he said in the interview. I havent done anything, and why are the marshals knocking on my door? Its amazing.Sitting alongside Representative Gene Green, a Democrat in the 29th District, Mr. Aker recounted how he was taken to a federal court, where he was made to wait in a cell for a hearing. He then had to sign a payment agreement for the 29-year-old loan. The amount: $1,500.I just couldnt believe that I was standing before the court with no rights read to me, he said.Mr. Aker is a project manager at a company called Phantom Power Productions, according to his LinkedIn profile. Calls to his employer went unanswered Tuesday.The United States Marshals Service said in a statement that agents had been trying to collect on Mr. Akers debt since 2012 when they finally tracked him down to his Houston residence.The statement said the situation escalated when he threatened two deputies, saying he had a gun.After Aker made the statement that he was armed, the statement read, in order to protect everyone involved, the deputies requested additional law enforcement assistance.The story that caught fire online cited an unnamed source with the United States Marshals Service in Houston who said plans were afoot to arrest between 1,200 and 1,500 more people who had failed to repay federal student loans. According to the marshals, about 1,500 people in Houston have missed court appearances to address their outstanding federal student loans, and those absences have resulted in arrest warrants.Mr. Green, the congressman, called the arrest an egregious example of private companies contracting with the government to help arrest and prosecute debtors.Our federal resources, our U.S. marshals and the federal court system are being used, I think, by the private sector, Mr. Green said in the Fox interview.To some extent, he is correct: After the Education Department exhausts attempts to contact a debtor and seize the debt with tactics that can include garnishing wages, the department turns over the delinquent accounts to the Department of Justice, and a lawsuit is filed. That is often when private lawyers get involved.M. H. Cersonsky, a lawyer with the Houston-based law firm Cersonsky, Rosen and Garcia, has contracted with the government to take student borrowers to court on behalf of the government and the Education Department. Documents show that Mr. Cersonskys name appears in Mr. Akers case  and it has been attached to roughly 7,000 student debt dockets in the United States District Courts Southern District of Texas since 2002.Mr. Cersonsky, who is known as Butch, said in a phone interview on Tuesday that arrests are at the end of the process of attempts to collect the debts, but he would not comment on this case or say how often arrests occur.In 2012, Mr. Cersonsky was quoted as saying that the firm helped return as much as $1 million to the government in one year alone, Bloomberg reported.Some advocates say the tactics used are becoming increasingly aggressive.The director of the National Consumer Law Centers Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project, Persis Yu, said in an interview that arrests were an extreme version of what she described as the draconian consequences of the governments attempts to contact student borrowers.I dont know the circumstances of this guys loans or his legal troubles, Ms. Yu said. But its certainly heartbreaking to see somebody be arrested for a debt. Weve outlawed debtors prisons in this country and for good reason.After his arrest, court documents reveal, Mr. Aker, whose name was given as Winford P. Aker, not only had to sign the repayment plan for his student loan; he was also ordered to pay the marshals $1,258.60 as reimbursement for his arrest.Now, with interest, court fees and a reimbursement order, Mr. Aker owes about $3,800, more than twice the amount of the loans original principal."}

Now a large new study has found that they are associated with an increased risk for dementia as well.Proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s, are widely available both by prescription and over the counter under various brand names, including Prevacid, Prilosec and Nexium.German researchers, using a database of drug prescriptions, studied P.P.I. use in 73,679 men and women older than 75 who were free of dementia at the start of the study. Over an average follow-up period of more than five years, about 29,000 developed Alzheimers disease or other dementias. The study is in JAMA Neurology.After controlling for age, sex, depression, diabetes, stroke, heart disease and the use of other medicines, they found that regular use of P.P.I.s increased the risk for dementia in men by 52 percent and in women by 42 percent, compared with nonusers.Our study does not prove that P.P.I.s cause dementia, said the senior author, Britta Haenisch of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases. It can only provide a statistical association. This is just a small part of the puzzle.Clinicians, pharmacists and patients have to weigh the benefits against the potential side effects, she continued, and future studies will help to better inform these decisions."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Kudos to Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon for re-sounding the alarm on nuclear winter (Lets End the Peril of Nuclear Winter, Op-Ed, Feb. 11).Addressing the unique danger posed by nuclear weapons should be an urgent political and social issue, yet nukes seem somehow to have transformed from a monstrous threat to just part of the furniture in the room decades after the end of the Cold War.The writers seem to lack the courage of their conviction, however. They call for President Obama  who, despite having espoused global nuclear disarmament, has proposed a 30-year, $1 trillion program to modernize all facets of the United States nuclear arsenal  to reduce our nuclear weapons to 1,000. Yet Mr. Robock and Mr. Toon state that the explosion of only 100 nuclear weapons could produce climate change unseen in recorded human history.The correct number of nuclear weapons we need to reduce to is not 1,000 but zero. President Obama could, and should, initiate international negotiations on a treaty to abolish nuclear weapons, as the United States and other original nuclear powers are required to do by the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Banning nukes forever is the only way to protect the planet from nuclear winter.KEVIN MARTINExecutive DirectorPeace ActionSilver Spring, Md."}

{"text": "It would be an understatement to say that James Truman has given some thought to how his new restaurant, Nix, will look.Mr. Truman, 57, who once oversaw magazines like Vogue, Glamour and GQ as the powerful editorial director of Cond Nast, is a believer in the cumulative effect of the most minuscule details. He has spent months with the chef John Fraser, the architect Elizabeth Roberts and the rest of the team behind Nix ruminating on everything from the presence of decorative juniper roots to the fit of the servers aprons to the way in which the establishments name will radiate from a sign.The blessing of the name is that its all straight lines, he said the other day inside 72 University Place in Greenwich Village, a narrow space where Nix is scheduled to open on Feb. 29. Im fond of the N, the I and the X, because theyre all strong letters. They are very strong letters which we then want to make soft.To achieve this, Mr. Truman is going with a sign that uses amber and red neon (neon, said Mr. Truman, a British native, represents the American vernacular). But his design team is placing the neon behind a translucent Plexiglas scrim so it will have a much more mysterious presence from the sidewalk, he said.While its probably facile to note that Mr. Truman seems to be orchestrating the entrance to Nix the way an editor would map out the cover of a magazine, the comparison is difficult to resist. Magazines and restaurants tend to succeed when they convey simultaneous signals of accessible warmth and exclusive cool, and Mr. Truman has fashioned a peripatetic career out of mastering the balance between those two temperatures.Although its not widely publicized, Mr. Truman has been a restaurateur for a while now, having joined with the hotelier Andr Balazs to fine-tune the mission, hire chefs and map out the menus at Narcissa, in the East Village, and at the celebrity-clotted Chiltern Firehouse in London. He has also run the farm that shares land with Locusts-on-Hudson, an upstate estate owned by Mr. Balazs.Nix, whose primary investor is Steve Ells, the founder of Chipotle Mexican Grill, presents Mr. Truman with a gamble: Hes trying his hand at hospitality without one of Mr. Balazss properties as an anchor.He has this way of seeing what people want before they want it, said Mr. Fraser, who is also the head chef at Narcissa and both proprietor and chef at Dovetail. When Mr. Fraser presented him with the concept for Nix  a vegetarian restaurant with a strong emphasis on the primordial pleasures of fire, as delivered by both a wok station and a tandoor in the kitchen  Mr. Trumans response was: Yes, thats exactly what the next move is.Other New York restaurants, like Dirt Candy and Avant Garden, have been uprooting stubborn preconceptions about vegetarian cuisine, but Mr. Truman, drawing on his publishing experience, views the crowded field as a boon. Its always better to be in a genre where youre not the only magazine, he said. Because it validates the idea.Mr. Fraser, 40, who grew up in California and is known as a pioneer of vegetable-fixated cooking, gets visibly amped up when he talks about the Nix menu, with its shiitake cacio e pepe, and its carrots seared in the wok in the style of Chinese cashew chicken.He will not use meat or fish, nor any stocks or fats derived from them. But he will cook with cheese and butter. Theres a moment of sin, even though its quite virtuous, Mr. Fraser said.Its hard to imagine Mr. Truman, whose hair retains the tousled, finger-combed quality of his wonder-boy years, swooning over a sinless restaurant. In casual conversation, he gives the impression of having lived a very full life; his musings are peppered with references to practicing Zen on a California mountaintop with Leonard Cohen and drinking wine in Northern California with Francis Ford Coppola, for whose company he was a board member.Mr. Truman traces his interest in the cultural significance of food back to Oundle, a boarding school in England where, as a student, he wrote a newspaper column about the delights of hot-plate gastronomy. The food in the refectory there was always disgusting, so I cooked my own food, Mr. Truman said. I remember a cheese and tomato crepe.His palate expanded as his parents tugged him around Europe on vacations. There were the featherweight cheese puffs known as gougres at a Michelin-starred restaurant on the French Riviera; there was pizza in Italy. The first pizza I had was on the waterfront in Positano, he said. That was astonishing. I dont think Id ever tasted anything so good in my life.At Cond Nast, when he ascended in 1994 from editor in chief of Details magazine to editorial director of the company, Mr. Truman stage-managed countless aspects of the Frank Gehry-designed cafeteria. I came to enjoy that at least as much as I enjoyed working on the magazines, he said.Asked about Mr. Trumans expanding foray into hospitality, Ravi DeRossi, who also ambled into the restaurant business after pursuing a different professional path (as an abstract painter), said he did not believe in an exact science to opening a restaurant in New York City.Honestly, I think theres a lot of dumb luck involved, said Mr. DeRossi, who owns and runs 15 bars and restaurants, including Avant Garden. At least thats what I owe to my success to  that and approaching each new venture as a piece of art rather than a business.Mr. Truman has strong ideas about the visual side of Nix. It began with knowing what we didnt want, he said, by which he meant one of the Brooklyn-style restaurants full of reclaimed lumber, and servers who look like agrarians from the 19th century. (On the monotonously facial-haired species of the hipster: I wonder how their wives and girlfriends recognize them and dont wind up going home with someone else by mistake.)In his mind, Brooklyn and bearded are out; Californian and hippie-willowy are in. I felt this should have a feminine energy, he said. The current style of restaurants feels incredibly dated to me.Diners at Nix will encounter a distinct intention, he hopes, in even the smallest of gestures. On each table will be paper flowers from John Derian in the East Village. Sparkling and still water will simply arrive, in tandem and sans interrogation.We hate that first question, Do you want tap, still or sparkling? he said. Lets move on to the stuff we care about.Mr. Truman takes a keen interest in whats expressed between the lines and kept in the background, which makes him wary in a world of celebrity chefs.My opinion, he said, is that chefs replaced magazine editors as the most culturally overrated people in the world."}

{"text": "The criminal case arising from the collapse of the once-prominent law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf has been cut in half, with Manhattan prosecutors agreeing to a deferred prosecution agreement with another of the four original defendants.Prosecutors announced the agreement with Zachary Warren, a 31-year-old lawyer, during a court hearing on Tuesday afternoon that came just weeks before he was to go on trial in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.Mr. Warren will be required to perform 350 hours of community service as part of the one-year agreement.Last month, prosecutors working for Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, reached a similar deal with Steven H. Davis, the former chairman of Dewey. Mr. Vances prosecutors agreed to the deferred agreement with Mr. Davis after a jury deadlocked on dozens of charges against him and two other former executives at the law firm, Stephen DiCarmine and Joel Sanders.The hung jury in their trial was a blow to Mr. Vance and his prosecutorial team, which had said the three men were the architects of a huge accounting fraud that enabled Dewey to defraud its lenders and creditors during much of the financial crisis.Mr. Warren, who was a low-level employee at Dewey and not yet a lawyer at the time the firm collapsed in spring 2012, early on had his trial separated from that of the three former executives. His scheduled trial in March was seen as another test of the strength of the prosecutions case in the planned retrial of Mr. DiCarmine, 59, and Mr. Sanders, 57, in September.The state judge overseeing the Dewey criminal proceedings, Justice Robert M. Stolz, has indicated he may rule next week on motions by lawyers for Mr. DiCarmine, the firms former executive director, and Mr. Sanders, its former chief financial officer, to dismiss some of the grand larceny charges still pending against them.A deferred prosecution agreement typically calls for the charges against someone to be dismissed after a period of time if that person does not violate the deal or commit other crimes.The deal with Mr. Davis was much tougher. That agreement runs for five years and Mr. Davis is not permitted to practice law in New York during that time.The agreement with Mr. Warren, who is currently working for a small law firm in Pittsburgh, does not come as a complete surprise after the hung jury and the deferred prosecution given to Mr. Davis. The decision by prosecutors to indict Mr. Warren, who was a client relations manager at the 1,300-lawyer firm, was criticized by some in the New York legal community as a heavy-handed move by Mr. Vances office.After leaving Dewey, Mr. Warren went on to graduate from the law school of Georgetown University and clerk for a federal judge. He is to begin working as a lawyer with Williams & Connolly, a large Washington-based law firm, in the fall.We are deeply pleased that the district attorneys office has decided to dismiss the charges, said Paul Shechtman and William Murphy, the lawyers representing Mr. Warren, in a statement.Prosecutors have said that Mr. Warren played a pivotal role in the Dewey accounting scandal because he attended a steak dinner at Del Friscos in Midtown Manhattan in December 2008, when Mr. Sanders and Frank Canellas, the firms former finance director, discussed ways to overcome a shortfall of more than $50 million in the firms net income.Mr. Vances prosecutorial team has said that at that dinner, a multiyear scheme began to make Dewey look more profitable than it was to bank lenders and insurance companies that invested in debt offerings by the law firm.Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, said in a statement, The deferred prosecution agreement is unrelated to the strength of the case. She added that prosecutors are confident that, had this case proceeded to trial, we would have met our burden of proof.Neither Mr. Davis nor Mr. Warren is expected to testify at the coming trial of Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders.Both Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders rejected plea deals that would have required them to plead guilty to at least one felony charge.

Trumps popularity continues to rise nationally, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll that shows him with more than double the support of his closest Republican contender.The poll found that 39 percent of Republicans across the country support Mr. Trump, while 19 percent back Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and 18 percent back Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson sit in the mid-single digits and make up the bottom tier of the Republican field.The poll showed Mr. Trump with his highest level of national support to date among Republicans. Although Mr. Trump is viewed as being the most electable and the best leader in the field, Mr. Rubio beats him when it comes to empathy, honesty and shared values.Things are tighter for the Democrats, where Hillary Clinton leads Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by 44 percent to 42 percent. As with the Republicans, Mrs. Clinton wins on electability and leadership, but Mr. Sanders is seen as more truthful and better at relating to the needs of voters.The Quinnipiac survey had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points."}
{"text": "They come from different tribes. She, in her fur-trimmed hood, could be a Native American of the far north, though her pointe shoes are puzzling. He, with his chest bare above what looks like a grass skirt, might be Polynesian, though the skirt is made of silvery tinsel and his crown suggests ice. She wields a small electric fan; he, a flashlight. But this woman and man join together in a traditional ballet pas de deux.Such is the perplexing start of Kathryn Posins highly peculiar Climate Control, which had its premiere at the 92nd Street Y as part of the opening program of this years Harkness Dance Festival. Ms. Posin provides an epigraph from Robert Frosts poem about the world ending in fire or ice, but her polarities are as jumbled (intentionally, it appears) as the props (by Todd Strong) and costumes (by A. Christina Giannini). Inuit with surfboards, Samoans with skis: In this piece, the climate is out of control.This is a potentially chilling subject, yet the work, as seen on Friday, treats its theme with wan whimsy. Ms. Posins choreography  largely conventional ballet, adeptly arranged and accessorized with Arctic hula  settles for incongruity. Cold and hot collide, and the tribes eventually merge for a big finale but without generating any storms of imagination or gusts of humor. The pressure remains low.What makes this especially disappointing is the contrast with the music: sections of Meredith Monks Facing North, vocalized on Friday by none other than Theo Bleckman and Ms. Monk herself. Summoning winds with their mouths, they conjured open spaces with open chords and the energy of keeping warm through a swapping of notes, suggesting an entire mental atmosphere that Ms. Posins dance didnt approach.In the case of Ms. Posins Century Rolls, the guest star was more beneficial. Amar Ramasar, moonlighting from New York City Ballet, gave this 2014 ensemble work a push every time he entered. Dancing on a larger scale than the rest of the capable cast, he raised the excitement level of a ballet that isnt so exciting, despite its competent matching of both the bustle and the Satie-like delicacy in its John Adams score.Ms. Posins 1975 Waves isnt ballet. Probably her most famous work (the Alvin Ailey company used to perform it), it is modern in a mid-20th-century sense, weighted and earnest in its barefoot style and solid construction but softened by flower power. Intricately mimicking the action of waves and the behavior of sea life, the ensemble swells and crests, provoking more admiration than delight. The aesthetic climate has changed."}
{"text": "ZURICH  The suspended FIFA president Sepp Blatter was back at FIFA headquarters for what could be the final time on Tuesday, challenging his eight-year ban for approving a $2 million payment to his former adviser Michel Platini in 2011.Blatter arrived 90 minutes early for the scheduled morning start of his hearing before the FIFA appeals committee. He was barred from the building last October while he was under investigation.Blatter avoided television cameras at the main gate when he left through a rear entrance after a hearing that lasted seven hours.Platinis session with the four-man appeals panel had lasted an hour longer on Monday, when he fought his own eight-year ban that was imposed by the FIFA ethics committee in December.Blatter and Platini were suspended for offering or accepting gifts, for conflicts of interest, and for disloyalty to FIFA.Both men denied any wrongdoing, claiming they had an understanding that Platini would receive additional salary to work as Blatters adviser from 1999 to 2002.FIFA would not comment on when appeal verdicts were expected. FIFA will hold an election on Feb. 26 in which member federations are scheduled to choose the next president in a five-man contest.The case threatened to end the careers of Blatter and Platini, Blatters one-time protg.Their falls capped a year of turmoil for FIFA, which was rocked by American and Swiss federal investigations of corruption in global soccer that pressured Blatter to announce his resignation plans last June.Platini appeared to have strong support for his presidential bid by September, when the Swiss police arrived at FIFA headquarters to question both men. FIFA ethics judges suspended them days later, pending a full investigation."}
{"text": "Stocks climbed on Wednesday as investors clung to hope for an international deal to stem a global glut in crude oil by cutting production. The price of oil rose sharply, as did the stocks of major energy companies like Chevron.Tech stocks also rose, led by Microsoft and Facebook.The gains capped a three-day rally, the longest in 2016, and wiped out about half of the markets losses this year. The Standard & Poors 500-stock index hit its lowest point of the year last Thursday, and has risen about 5 percent since.Priceline, Fossil and Garmin rose after reporting robust earnings.The S.&P. 500 rose 31.24 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 1,926.82.The Nasdaq composite index jumped 98.10 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,534.06. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 257.42 points, or 1.6 percent, to 16,453.83.The price of oil recovered as investors again hoped for an international deal that will cap or cut production. Several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are in talks about freezing production at January levels, but that deal requires the agreement of all members, and Iran said on Wednesday that it would not stop increasing exports.Still, investors appeared to be encouraged that the oil-producing countries were talking.The price of American crude jumped $1.62, or 5.6 percent, to $30.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose $2.32, or 7.2 percent, to $34.50 a barrel in London.American crude soared on Friday in anticipation of a deal on production levels, but even with the recent gains, it is down 17 percent this year.Energy stocks climbed with the price of oil. Chevron rose $3.50, or 4.1 percent, to $88.31; Hess picked up $2.63, or 6.4 percent, to $43.47. Tech stocks made big gains, led by Microsoft, which added $1.33, or 2.6 percent, to close at $52.42, and Facebook, which rose $3.59, or 3.5 percent, to $105.20.Devon Energy, an oil and natural gas company, missed those gains after saying it would eliminate 20 percent of its staff in the first quarter and slash spending and its quarterly dividend in response to the diminished price of oil. Its stock lost 93 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $20.33. It is down 69 percent over the last year.While corporate earnings have been shaky over all, companies that surpassed analysts expectations were rewarded on Wednesday. Priceline, an the online travel company, climbed after its profit and revenue beat estimates. The stock gained $124.88, or 11.2 percent, to $1,235.56. Expedia rose 5 percent and TripAdvisor added 3 percent; they each posted strong results last week.Garmin, which makes personal navigation devices, rose $5.83, or 16.5 percent, to $41.06 after its fourth-quarter profit topped Wall Street estimates.Fossil, a watch and accessories maker, posted strong results, and its annual profit guidance pleased investors. The stock added $9.84, or 28.6 percent, to $44.30. Fossil was one of the worst-performing stocks in the S.&P. 500 last year. It lost almost two-thirds of its value as fitness trackers became more popular and after the release of Apple Watch.Kinder Morgan, a pipeline company, jumped 10 percent on the increase in oil prices and from the news that Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway has taken a 1.2 percent stake in the company. The stock advanced $1.56 and closed at $17.18.United States factories cranked out more cars, furniture and food in January. The Federal Reserve said factory output rose 0.5 percent, the biggest increase since July. Output had fallen in four of the previous five months, and the data suggests domestic manufacturing may be recovering after struggling last year.In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3.3 cents, to $1 a gallon. Heating oil rose 6.1 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $1.088 a gallon. Natural gas added 3.9 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.942 per 1,000 cubic feet.The price of gold rose $3.20, to $1,211.40 an ounce and silver inched up 4.3 cents, to $15.377 an ounce. Copper added 2.5 cents, to $2.076 a pound.European stocks also rallied. The German Dax gained 3 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 picked up 2.9 percent.Asian stocks slumped. The Nikkei 225 in Japan fell 1.4 percent as investors shrugged off data showing strong machinery orders in January. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1 percent; the Shanghai composite rose 1.1 percent.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 1.82 percent from 1.78 percent. The dollar slipped to 113.77 yen from 113.88 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1139 from $1.1144."}

{"text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.   A few days after the Mets clinched the National League East in September and General Manager Sandy Alderson was doused with champagne, looking happier than he had in years, he was told he had cancer. He dealt with the news quietly as he fine-tuned his roster and had two more champagne baths in the Mets run to the World Series.It was a little surreal, you know? he said Wednesday. Having not been to the World Series in 25 years. Having never been diagnosed with cancer.He chuckled and added: It was a little bit odd. But the great thing about the postseason was, it was a distraction at that time. Distractions are always nice.Now another distraction  spring training, to be followed by another season  has arrived. Alderson met with the news media for about 20 minutes Wednesday, cracking jokes as usual and discussing the state of the teams pitching, David Wrights back and his own health.Until recently, Alderson had not divulged much about himself, and he has still not said what type of cancer he has. The Mets waited until the first week of December to announce his condition and the eight to 12 weeks of chemotherapy he would undergo. Alderson missed the winter meetings because of those treatments and has taken time off for the additional treatments he receives every couple of weeks, but he has been working full time.I feel great, Alderson said, beaming. Im ready to go.Some of his enthusiasm could have come from the confidence of his players. Matt Harvey and Jacob deGrom indicated recently that getting back to the World Series, and winning it, was the Mets goal this season  and it seemed reasonable.If the Mets are contenders, it will probably be because of their pitching, and Alderson vowed to take care of his young starters, even if Harvey (a year removed from Tommy John surgery), deGrom and Noah Syndergaard will not have innings limits.To give his young starters time to rest, after they pitched through October, Alderson plans to have them sit out the first four or five spring training games and then start building their stamina and pitch counts.Were going to be mindful of their health, Alderson said, not necessarily looking at innings limits but at the same time making sure they are as strong and as healthy and as capable as possible throughout the season. We may do some things this year that we did last year to ensure that.I think with any pitching, whether a pitcher has had Tommy John or not, in this day and age, as hard as many guys throw and as hard as our guys throw, youve got to be very careful about it.Judging by his tone, Alderson seemed more concerned about the health of Wright, who is entering his first full season since being told he has spinal stenosis. Alderson said that he had not yet outlined a plan with Wright but that he expected Wright to play 130 games or so. That suggests the Mets will use spring training to try rotating other players at third base, including, perhaps, Neil Walker, Asdrubal Cabrera and Wilmer Flores.Were going to have to be mindful of his physical situation and anticipate rather than react to that condition, Alderson said of Wright. Its hard to say right now, but certainly were going to go beyond just monitoring his health. Were going to have to be proactive.In a change from years past, the Mets do not have position battles to sort out. Their to-do list seems far less dire: figuring out the outfield rotation, finding another position for catchers Travis dArnaud and Kevin Plawecki to play at times, filling out the bullpen and nurturing Zack Wheeler and Josh Edgin as they return from Tommy John surgery.The culture around the organization has changed dramatically, too. As Alderson was packing his belongings for spring training, he brought with him a news report with a headline that referred to his statement two years ago calling for the Mets to shoot for 90 wins. At the time of that remark, given the state of the team, some analysts mocked Alderson. Then, in 2015, the Mets won 90 games.A reporter asked Alderson if that meant the Mets were aiming higher now.Well, look, he said, we want to win enough games to win the division. Is that 90? Is it 92? Is it 94? I dont know what the number is. I was with a team that won a division with 82. We certainly have higher expectations than that. But we have to go realize them.So, the reporter joked, is the number 95, then?Smiling, and on cue, Alderson quipped, Thats a freeway.INSIDE PITCHJeurys Familia, the Mets closer, said he had not spoken to his good friend Jenrry Mejia since Major League Baseball gave Mejia a lifetime suspension last week for failing his third drug test. Familia said that he was trying to give Mejia space but that its tough for me because hes my friend.I dont know what he thinks, Familia continued. But everybody knows, when you do something wrong, youve got to pay for it. Thats all."}
{"text": "Where do techies look for inspiration to help invent new immersive worlds?In the nascent industry of virtual reality, the answer is science fiction.So found Nick Wingfield, when he recently explored the intersection between virtual-reality gadget makers like Oculus and science fiction novels and movies.The ties run deep: Oculus, owned by Facebook, actually hands out a copy of Ready Player One, a sci-fi novel, to new recruits. Magic Leap, an augmented reality start-up, has hired three sci-fi and fantasy writers, including novelist Neal Stephenson, who wrote Snow Crash. And references to Star Trek and other sci-fi stalwarts abound at many virtual-reality start-ups.Why the strong connection between the two sides? Palmer Luckey, a co-founder of Oculus, put it best. Like many other people working in the tech space, Im not a creative person, he said. Sci-fi writers and creators, he added, are really creative people figuring out what the ultimate use of any technology might be."}
{"text": "THE BACKLASH OVER CHINESE TAKEOVERS  |  Wariness over Chinese acquisitions of American tech companies has grown enough to thwart an attempted takeover of Fairchild Semiconductor International,\nKeith Bradsher and Paul Mozur report in DealBook.Fairchild decided to remain in the hands of a United States company by favoring a smaller bid from ON Semiconductor over a $2.5 billion deal led by Chinese state-backed buyers.And it is not just tech purchases  moves into areas like heavy equipment, aerospace and financial services are drawing attention from both ends of the American political spectrum.Members of Congress wrote to the Treasury Department, demanding an investigation of a bid by a Chongqing-based company to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has also attracted attention  it can recommend against foreign deals made for American companies or companies connected to the United States for security reasons.Many in the semiconductor industry are watching to see whether Cfius will investigate a bid by the Chinese chip maker Tsinghua Holdings for a stake in Western Digital. Chinese interest in the semiconductor industry has attracted the most attention in Washington because chips are the cores of a number of military systems.Chinese bids seem likely to increase as the  economy in China slows and companies based there move money out of the country before the renminbi can weaken any further.Ingram Micro, a company based in California that distributes technology, agreed to be bought by Tianjin Tianhai, a Chinese shipping company, and merged into HNA, the shipping and logistics conglomerate, Amie Tsang reports in DealBook. The $6 billion deal was agreed upon even in the face of increasing concern from Washington.Even if these deals are completed, the companies will still be haunted by past failures, Quentin Webb writes in Breakingviews.Most of Chinas big overseas takeovers to date have fared poorly  large oil, mining and finance deals have been the victims of terrible timing.Oil prices have more than halved since those deals were struck and this was compounded by operational headaches such as a civil war in Yemen and a struggle to extract in crude oil from Canadas oil sands.The record is not much better in commodities.The list of value-destroying deals being racked up is worrying given the rush for outbound deals. Chinese buyers may have learned some lessons, but they can struggle to run new overseas outposts effectively and piles of debt raise the stakes even further.EX-DEUTSCHE BANK ANALYST TO PAY $100,000 OVER RATINGS  |  The Securities and Exchange Commission settled with a former stock analyst over accusations that he had failed to tell investors what he really believed about the company whose shares he was promoting, \nLiz Moyer reports in DealBook.\nThe former analyst, Charles P.

{"text": "LONDON   Old-fashioned, upper class and with a habit of spouting Latin quotations, the British lawmaker and European Union critic Jacob Rees-Mogg is affectionately known in Parliament as the honorable member for the early 20th century.But with a referendum looming on Britains place in the union, Mr. Rees-Mogg and other Tory euroskeptics think that they are on the right side of history in pressing Britons to quit.The British people feel closer to the Americans than they do to the French, said Mr. Rees-Mogg, 46, sitting in an ornate tearoom in Parliament, overlooking the Thames River.Yet, the euroskeptics are plagued by internal disputes, underscored by the presence of the Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, in Brussels this week trying to complete a deal on restrictions on welfare payments to migrants from other European Union nations and other sovereignty issues. Mr. Cameron hopes an agreement will enable him to campaign for his country to remain in the bloc.With the referendum likely to be held in June, the euroskeptics inability to coalesce around a single, clear message or leader is complicating their cause, even as their long-sought goal of ending Britains membership in the European Union is within reach.The internal spats extend beyond the Conservative Party to competing private groups representing rival ideological camps  free-market conservatives, like Mr. Rees-Mogg, and a more populist, anti-immigrant component embodied most visibly by Nigel Farage, leader of the nativist U.K. Independence Party.Because cabinet ministers who oppose Mr. Cameron on the issue are not yet free to argue to leave the union (they will be once the renegotiation is complete), so far the less senior euroskeptic lawmakers have been making the case.Advocates of a British withdrawal from the union constitute a lively and outspoken  if ill-disciplined  force. Naturally, they are not impressed with Mr. Camerons renegotiation: Liam Fox, a former defense secretary, has accused him of handing out the political begging bowl. Philip Davies, another Conservative lawmaker who favors leaving the bloc, calls the effort an absolute shambles.Mr. Farages U.K. Independence Party has come to prominence in the last decade, successfully capitalizing on concerns over immigration in European elections but not in those for the British Parliament.But the Conservatives have been split on Europe since before 1990 when Margaret Thatcher was pushed out as prime minister. She supported membership of the European Economic Community, as it then was, in Britains previous referendum in 1975, but became steadily more hostile to European integration.Her ouster in a 1990 putsch was partly caused by European policy, and her successor, John Major, was tormented by her supporters.Even now, several years after her death, there is debate about how Mrs. Thatcher would have voted on exiting the bloc, a spectacularly silly discussion, according to Mr. Rees-Mogg, who ridiculed it by suggesting a quick sance.Knock once for yes, knock twice for no, he said, before rapping twice on the table and announcing, with a grin, that Mrs. Thatcher had spoken from beyond the grave. Its no! Mr. Rees-Mogg makes an economic case for Britain to go it alone, saying that Europe is narrowing Britains trading focus, when we need to broaden it. But he also highlights historical factors that, he says, set Britain apart, including that its also a long time since we have, off our own bat, wanted to fight anyone in Europe.As for his personal style Mr. Rees-Mogg, who does not own a pair of jeans, believes that arguments, not personal quirks will decide the referendum. Anyway, he says, I cant suddenly pretend to be Mr. Trendy.Not all euroskeptics are as entertaining as Mr. Rees-Mogg, perhaps because some have spent decades studying the subclauses of European Union treaties, regulations and other, mind-numbing texts. The best known and most knowledgeable of these is Bill Cash, a veteran lawmaker once derided by Mr. Major as obsessive, driven and, on Europe, frankly a bore.Mr. Cash has long worried about the erosion of national sovereignty. Younger euroskeptics also contend that European institutions lack democratic legitimacy, and that Britains history and common law legal system sets it apart.We have different histories, said Mr. Davies, the Conservative lawmaker. The motivation for the European Union was, in a sense, to stop France and Germany from going to war with each other.He added: If France and Germany want to do that, good luck to them. But that wasnt our history.While Mr. Rees-Mogg, was educated at Eton College and Oxford University and is the son of the onetime editor of The London Times, William Rees-Mogg, Mr. Davies grew up in Doncaster, northern England, and was a supermarket manager before being elected to Parliament.Mr. Daviess main argument reflects a switch of emphasis made by euroskeptics in the last decade, when they began to argue that membership in the bloc was shackling Britain to an economic corpse.Europe is an economic disaster zone, and unless we can start looking outwards, we are going to get nowhere, Mr. Davies said. That argument has resonance because it relates to the central reason that Britain joined the bloc in the first place.Back then Britains economy was stagnant and arguably needed the impetus of membership in a club that had helped France and Germany to thrive.Now the roles are reversed, with Britains economy outperforming most of the Continent.Euroskeptics are trying to reverse the common assumption that an exit is a leap into the unknown. Mr. Davies says the bloc is fated ultimately to fall apart, and Mr. Rees-Mogg suggests that it would be safer to stay governed by our own democratic forms, rather than to be in a country called Europe, governed by a bureaucracy in Brussels.Meanwhile, Mr. Farage and others have campaigned against immigration into Britain from Eastern Europe, which surged after the expansion of the European Union.That happened after Britain decided to open its labor market immediately to new European Union citizens in 2004, unlike countries such as Germany and France, which exercised a right to delay their employment rights.While Britain is outside the unions passport-free travel zone, known as Schengen, euroskeptics argue that since Europeans have a right to live and work in one anothers countries, only by quitting the bloc can Britain control its borders.Indeed, the big dilemma for those who want to quit the union is how hard to push this argument. The two main groups campaigning for a no vote are rivals: Vote Leave, supported by most Conservatives, which emphasizes economic and sovereignty issues; and Leave.eu, which has the support of Mr. Farage and focuses on immigration and identity.Other politicians know that while Mr. Farage might galvanize some voters, he is a divisive figure. That has led to feuding over which organization should be the approved no campaign.Whether these divisions matter to voters is unclear, and having several different messages might actually help the departure movement by allowing its campaign to reach different groups.One seasoned European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity following protocol, believes that in the end the divisions in the exit camp may not matter. Those who want Britain to remain in the bloc have a big battle on their hands, he said, because euroskeptics have tapped into a rich vein of British life.Its not just that Britons see themselves as different from the Continent, he said. Its more that they really want to be."}

{"text": "Beginning with the Tea Party wave and continuing through the not-Romney musical chairs of the 2012 Republican primary and the battles over debt limits and fiscal cliffs, most coverage of the Republican Partys internal divisions during the Obama era fell into an easy groove: There was the establishment, and there was the base.The establishment aspired to be mainstream and reasonable; the base took pride in being populist and angry. The establishment read The Wall Street Journal; the base loved talk radio and Glenn Beck. The establishment was merely conservative; the base was as far right as you could get.But as fiercely as their battles raged, the argument between the base and the establishment was very often about tactics more than ideology. There were exceptions, notably immigration reform, where there was a real policy dispute, and there were times when the base seemed to be groping its way toward a more substantive sort of populism. But mostly the partys divisions were about how to oppose President Obama, what kind of procedural moves to use against him, which theories to entertain about his motivations and when  if ever  to accept that a policy defeat really was defeat.Which means that for all the talk about Republican civil war throughout Obamas presidency, the ideological stakes were often relatively low. No matter which faction was in control, the G.O.P. was officially united against Obamas programs, and every other argument could wait.But in the 2016 primary, the wait is over, and we can see the deeper divisions within the party.These divisions are not new ones. As far back as 2005, when George W. Bush was still the president and not yet the last hope of his brothers struggling campaign, the Pew Research Center put together a political typology that identified three major right-of-center voting blocs. The first, which Pew called Enterprisers, were highly patriotic and strongly pro-business, hawkish and opposed to social welfare programs. Their political views basically tracked with the partys official commitments, and certainly tracked with the views of its leadership and donor class.But Enterprisers were only about a third of the Republican coalition. Another third were Social Conservatives  more religious than the Enterprisers, more anxious about mass immigration and more skeptical of business, and more supportive of an active government. The final third was what Pew called Pro-Government Conservatives  more financially stressed than the other groups, and even more likely than the Social Conservatives to be supportive of government regulations and a stronger safety net.Like any classification scheme, this one had its limits, and Pew has updated it repeatedly with different breakdowns in the decade since. But the 2005 edition captured a crucial point thats been brought home by Donald Trumps success in 2016: The Republican coalition, its authors wrote, now includes more lower-income voters than it once did, and many of these voters favor an activist government to help working class people.The 2005 Pew typology also suggested a useful way of looking at that coalition as a whole  not as a simple establishment-plus-base pyramid, but as a complicated partnership among business-friendly conservatives, social conservatives and a more inchoate populist cohort, for whom liberalism seems like an enemy but big government is not necessarily a dirty word.In this alliance, most observers of the Republican Party would agree, the business-friendly conservatives (Pews Enterprisers) are clearly the senior partners, religious conservatives are the junior partners and the pro-government populists get deficit-funded spending in boom times and table scraps when things get tight.But the Enterprisers hold on policy making is vulnerable, should religious conservatives and populists both rise against them  which is what many primary-season insurgencies have tried to do. From Pat Buchanan in 1992 and 1996 to Mike Huckabee in 2008 to Rick Santorum four years ago, various would-be outsiders have effectively sought to rally a united front of religious conservatives and populists, in hopes of renegotiating the terms of the coalitions partnership.They all failed. In 2016, though, something new is happening. A united front isnt being forged; instead, we have both a religious conservative and a populist insurgency, the former led by Ted Cruz and the latter by that most unlikely populist, Mr. Trump.In theory this should keep the coalitions weaker partners divided. But Trump is such a phenomenon that hes winning enough Enterprisers and enough evangelicals to break out of the Buchananite box, while Cruz has a level of funding and organization that no religious conservative candidate has enjoyed before.Their joint strength has left less than half of the vote available to the candidates running Republican campaigns  and since there are still three of those candidates, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and John Kasich, we have a strange logjam in which no candidate favored by the partys normal senior partners can seem to claim more than 20 percent of the vote.That dynamic may come to an end this weekend in South Carolina; the Enterprisers, donors and party leadership may finally find their candidate.Whether they do or not, they will still face a sustained two-front rebellion against Republican politics as we have known it since the 1980s. If theyre wise, that rebellions strength will inspire concessions and changes, a renegotiation of the conservative coalitions basic terms.If theyre not  well, now that we see the real fault lines clearly, its also clear how the whole thing could be shattered."}
{"text": "PHILADELPHIA   Before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit began the important business on Wednesday of deciding whether New Jersey could offer legal wagering on sports, Judge Thomas L. Ambro offered a tribute to Justice Antonin Scalia, listing his many contributions to the law.In my view, he was the most influential jurist of our generation, Judge Ambro said of Justice Scalia, who died last week.He concluded that Justice Scalia was a transformational figure. The soliloquy set an interesting tone for a rare en banc hearing in the ceremonial courtroom here, where 12 judges heard arguments on whether New Jerseys plan to operate sports books in its casinos and racetracks was legal under federal law. Their decision has the potential to transform the gambling landscape.Hanging in the balance is money  lots of it. Nevada, where sports betting is legal, took in $4.2 billion in wagers last year. That haul is dwarfed, however, by the more than $400 billion bet annually with bookies, often controlled by organized crime, or with offshore betting operations, according to law enforcement estimates.Not surprisingly, many states like New Jersey would like the opportunity to generate revenue from the millions of residents who bet on the Giants or the Devils, the Philadelphia Eagles or the Yankees.So far, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, known as Paspa, which prohibits states from authorizing, sponsoring, operating or licensing sports betting, has stood in their way. Last week, however, Pennsylvania passed a resolution asking Congress to repeal Paspa, and sports betting bills in other states are primed to allow sports betting if the federal statute is repealed.New Jersey has led the revolt. In January 2012, Gov. Chris Christie signed a sports betting bill into law, and New Jersey has since been in a battle against national sports organizations that opposed him.On Wednesday, the case pitted two legal heavyweights  both former United States solicitors general  against each other. Theodore B. Olson argued New Jerseys side, and Paul Clement represented the N.C.A.A., the N.F.L and other sports leagues, which contend that Paspa prohibits states from authorizing, sponsoring, operating or licensing sports betting.You dont bring in the big guns unless you think the stakes are very high, said Matthew Stiegler, an appellate lawyer and the author of ThirdCircuitBlog.com. It is like Clayton Kershaw versus Mike Trout.The panel of judges offered some All-Star appeal as well. It included Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, the sister of the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, and Judge Marjorie O. Rendell, the ex-wife of former Gov. Edward G.Rendell of Pennsylvania. The packed courtroom featured politicians and representatives from the sports leagues.While a pitcher-batter duel between Mr. Kershaw and Mr. Trout is compelling, perhaps the better analogy for New Jerseys fight to legalized sports betting is a prizefight. Christie I and Christie II have become the titular shorthand used by lawyers and the news media to refer to two previous appellate decisions. Both went against New Jersey but were based on contradictory interpretations that prompted a third clash.For Christie III, Mr. Olson and New Jersey entered the hearing with a punchers chance backed by some Moneyball-style analytics. En banc hearings, which include all 12 judges rather than a small panel, are not common in the Third Circuit, and the previous instances showed that the circuits judges were not afraid of reversing earlier decisions.It has granted requests for en banc rehearing in about one out of every thousand cases, Mr. Stiegler said. And six of the eight en banc cases under its current chief judge, Theodore McKee, have reversed the prior panel.Mr. Olson and New Jersey needed to convince seven of the 12 judges that the state was within its legal rights to take wagers at casinos in Atlantic City and at racetracks like Monmouth Park on the Jersey Shore. A 6-6 tie would mean that the N.C.A.A. and the pro leagues would prevail.It was definitely a hot bench, in courtroom parlance, meaning the judges were engaged and firing probing questions.Mr. Olson argued that Paspa prohibited New Jersey only from authorizing sports betting while the law that Christie signed in 2014 took the state out of the regulation business. In reply, Judge Kent Jordan asked whether this was just a bait-and-switch tactic since casinos and tracks were already under heavy state regulation.Its really just another way of authorizing, Judge Jordan said.Judge Julio Fuentes also mused that the sports books could be an honest operation without state oversight.Concepts like constitutionality and the 10th Amendment commandeering question were batted back and forth in dizzying fashion.Sometimes, Mr. Olson and Mr. Clement looked as if they were effortlessly bashing back squash balls; other times, they were lunging away from dodge balls.Within six months, the judges will hand down a decision.So, what are the odds?Look for either an 8-4 or 7-5 victory in favor of the leagues, said Daniel Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer at Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. I dont expect New Jersey to raise the white flag if it loses. The state is nothing if not persistent.Mr. Stiegler, too, believed New Jersey needed a clearer victory.I didnt see seven votes for New Jerseys side today, he said.State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak of Union, N.J., a Democrat and the sponsor of the sports betting bill, still thought the state had a shot.I think its going to be a squeaker, he said.If only New Jersey residents could bet on it."}

{"text": "If you were asked to assess African-American voting power, you might think about the long history of disenfranchisement that still lingers today, in troubles in Ferguson, Mo.; in efforts to roll back the Voting Rights Act; or in recent moves to limit voting access around the country.So it can be easy to miss something right in front of our faces: Were living in an era when blacks have essentially played kingmaker in the most important elections in the nation (thus also the world). And its happening again, as Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton battle to win the South Carolina primary on Feb. 27.Mr. Sanderss first move after his resounding victory in New Hampshire last week was to travel to meet Al Sharpton at Sylvias Restaurant in Harlem the next morning. Hes under no illusion: If he can make inroads with black voters and other nonwhite voters in the remaining primaries, hell have a chance against Mrs. Clinton. If he cant make those gains, he wont, as my colleague Nate Cohn has calculated. Recent history makes it clear: In the 2008 Democratic primaries, Mr. Obama could not have won without unified black support. Mrs. Clinton was the clear favorite. In late 2007, a Pew poll showed her ahead of Mr. Obama by 14 points in South Carolina.But after Mr. Obama won Iowa, black voters swung behind him, and he defeated her in South Carolina by 29 points. According to exit polls, blacks made up 55 percent of the South Carolina Democratic primary electorate, and Mr. Obama won 78 percent of that vote to Mrs. Clintons 19 percent. He went on to roll in states with large black populations, and he needed every bit of that help, barely holding off Mrs. Clinton for the nomination. In the 2012 presidential election, President Obama outdid Mitt Romney by 3.9 percentage points. There is not just one reason that Mr. Obama won. According to exit polls, he drew the support of 73 percent of Asian-Americans and 71 percent of Hispanics. But the black voting bloc was even more one-sided, at 93 percent. And black turnout far surpassed that of Asian-Americans and Hispanics. According to Amy Walter and David Wasserman at the Cook Political Report, the percentage of blacks who voted (66.2) also bested the percentage of whites (64.1)  for the first time.David Frum of The Atlantic noted that Obamas support dropped by 3.6 million votes between his election and his re-election, and absenteeism was most marked among younger voters and Latinos, but the participation of African-Americans actually increased between 2008 and 2012.Being part of a monolithic voting bloc has downsides. If votes from African-Americans are not up for grabs, the Democratic Party can more easily ignore their concerns. If they were free agents, they would be in a better bargaining position. Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post once wrote: In politics, as in business, competition is good. Monopolies inevitably take their customers for granted.African-Americans, so heavily invested in Democrats, have also more deeply felt the partys losses in state and local elections during a recent run of Republican dominance.But in close races at the presidential level, leveraging almost the entire weight of a motivated voting bloc  blacks are expected to make up around 20 percent of the Democratic 2016 primary electorate  can be very powerful.It would be easy to say that the only reason for that leverage and motivation is African-American support for an African-American candidate who became president. But the fierce bidding war for black voters in this years Democratic primaries, without a black candidate, suggests staying power.To remain as power brokers, converting a nomination victory into a place in the White House is obviously a crucial step, but the partys diverse coalition keeps growing and offering promise of future presidential victories. Its very early, but PredictWise gives a generic Democratic nomination winner a 61-39 edge over a Republican winner in November.For followers of political history, its a rich twist that the Southern strategy, which helped Republicans hold the White House for 20 out of 24 years starting in 1968, has given way to such influence by African-Americans. It all starts in South Carolina this cycle, with two especially important subsets of the black vote there. Blacks have a significantly higher rate of church attendance than whites. So while some black intellectuals like Ta-Nehisi Coates, Michelle Alexander and Cornel West have backed Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton is counting more on the black church.An Upshot reader, Ed of Old Field, N.Y., wrote: As white evangelicals are for Republicans, black evangelicals are an important constituency for Democrats, and Sanders in South Carolina will have as much of an uphill climb against their skepticism of him personally as Trump, for different reasons, had in Iowa. Not at all insurmountable, but a high hurdle. In the last South Carolina Democratic primary, black women made up 61 percent of the black vote. In the 2012 presidential election, black women voted at the highest rate of any group across race, gender and ethnicity, and 96 percent of them voted for President Obama, according to exit polls. It is not an exaggeration to say that black women, in formation and flexing their political power, could have the final say over whether Mrs. Clinton becomes the first female presidential nominee of either party."}

She will take over the role of Anna Leonowens the night that Daniel Dae Kim makes his Broadway debut as the King of Siam.Ms. OHara, who won a Tony last spring for The King and I, will play her final performance April 17. Her standby, Analisa Leaming, will play the role until Ms. Mazzie arrives.Ms. Mazzie, who said she went to the gym when she felt able to even during chemotherapy, is now back to working out full-time. With her stamina much increased even since New Years Eve, when she performed her solo show at Feinsteins/54 Below, she said she was feeling very strong.Earlier this month she did a four-city mini-concert tour to the Czech Republic with her husband, the actor Jason Danieley. One night, with some others, they decided to climb the many steps to Prague Castle.I went with my husband and two other men, Ms. Mazzie said. And I beat them all."}

{"text": "SOFIA  Only two days after the signature of the Bulgarian-Turkish declaration of non-aggression a heated controversy has arisen over its interpretation, involving not only the two countries directly concerned but also other Balkan nations and other powers with interests in the Balkans.This morning two of the leading Sofia newspapers headlined stories which expressed the view that Turkey was no longer obliged to assist Greece in the event Greece was attacked by German forces using Bulgarian bases. The publication of these despatches in prominent places on the front pages of the two newspapers evoked a strong negative reaction in both Turkish and British diplomatic circles.The Turks, particularly, felt that the articles were not in harmony with the spirit of the recent declaration and that they should not have been allowed to appear in the press, which is government controlled.

{"text": "MINNEAPOLIS   Saturday is Senior Day for the University of Minnesota womens hockey team, so earlier this week, Amanda Kessel joined the other four members of her graduating class for an on-ice photo at Ridder Arena, their home rink. Kessel smiled, though the whole thing felt a bit weird. Kessel arrived with the class of 2014, not 2016. This became her class by happenstance.They were freshmen when I was a junior here, Kessel said. I got a new class. But its a good class.Kessel, 24, is just finishing her eligibility after missing one season for the 2014 Olympics and then the next year and a half recovering from postconcussion symptoms. The 2013 Patty Kazmaier Award winner as Division Is best female hockey player, Kessel, a right wing, rejoined the third-ranked Golden Gophers this month. She has one goal and three assists in four games.Only recently has Kessel, a former N.C.A.A. scoring champion and the younger sister of Pittsburgh Penguins right wing Phil Kessel, spoken in detail about her concussion and lengthy recovery.It started with a freak accident in a United States national team scrimmage several months before the Sochi Olympics.Somebody tripped, took out my legs and I went headfirst into the boards, said Kessel, who could not recall exactly where or when it took place.Kessel, who sustained one concussion in high school, said she did not play for a month and a half. She sat out the Bring on the World Tour before the Olympics with what the team called a lower-body injury.In Sochi, Kessel scored three goals and tied for the team lead with six points, as the United States won the silver medal. But after the Games, she said, things unraveled.Going into Sochi, I felt well, she said. Then a week and even months after, I noticed these weird things that I thought were normal, but they werent  sensitivity to light, headaches, fogginess, and I was nauseous all the time. I couldnt figure out why, because I wasnt hit again or anything.Josephine Pucci, an American teammate of Kessels, and Haley Irwin of Canada also missed significant periods with concussion-related problems before and after playing in the gold medal game in Sochi.Instead of returning to the Gophers in September 2014 as planned, Kessel spent the next few months being treated at the Carrick Brain Center in Marietta, Ga. Dr. Ted Carrick, a chiropractic neurologist, helped Pucci and the former American Olympian Caitlin Cahow return to play, so Kessel was hopeful. But she still struggled.It took some of my symptoms away, but not what I would have liked, she said. I got my eyes back on track. They did everything they could to try and help me, and theyve had a lot of successes with a bunch of my teammates. I think over all, it wasnt the treatment that was going to push me where I needed to be.A physical therapist Kessel knew in her hometown, Madison, Wis., recommended she see Dr. Michael Collins, the highly regarded director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centers sports medicine concussion program. Collins has treated hundreds of amateur and professional athletes, among them the Nascar driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Chicago Cubs catcher David Ross. Kessel said she started seeing Collins in June.Collins declined to discuss Kessels treatment, but at a concussion conference at the medical center in October, Collins was among about three dozen clinicians and researchers who recommended physical activity for concussion rehabilitation. Kessel had stopped working out when her symptoms took hold, and she said Collins urged her to resume.That was really the main piece that started turning things around, Kessel said. Being a highly active athlete, and then doing nothing for a year and a half, that wasnt helping my symptoms. I started working out, started doing things, and my symptoms continued to do better. Thirty minutes of cardio a day is pretty much what I was doing for a while.At first it was tough, because I couldnt understand why you were doing more when you dont feel well. Then I really started to understand more and more what I was doing. A month into treatment, I re-enrolled in school.In September, Kessel took her first twirls around the ice since Sochi, alone.It was nice being back out there, she said. But right away, I missed the competitiveness of actually playing. It wasnt so bad going out there the first four, five times by myself. But then I was ready to get in there and play with others.In July, Gophers Coach Brad Frost announced that Kessel would not play this season. That changed in January when she began practicing with her teammates. The university medical staff cleared her for games in early February.Back two or three years ago, Im not sure she thought she would be playing hockey again, Frost said. Now over the last six months, to get back to where she is, 100 percent healthy, is just tremendous.Kessel led Minnesota to N.C.A.A. championships in 2012 and 13, the second of those coming in a 41-0-0 season, the first undefeated campaign in Division I womens hockey. She returned too late this season to help the Gophers (27-3-1), the defending N.C.A.A. champions, overtake their rival Wisconsin (30-1-1) for the Western Collegiate Hockey Association regular-season title.The second-ranked Badgers swept Minnesota in a two-game series in early December in Madison, ending an 18-game winless streak against the Gophers. The teams meet again here Friday and Saturday in the final series of the regular season. Minnesota is 12-0-1 since losing to the Badgers and 3-0-1 with Kessel.She was gone for three years, and you wouldnt know it the way she plays, said the senior center Hannah Brandt, Kessels linemate then and now. Its awesome having her back. I obviously enjoy playing with her. Its been a lot of fun so far.Now Kessel is thinking about another N.C.A.A. title bid, and perhaps the 2018 Olympics. She expects to graduate in August with a sports management degree  a little late, but healthy at last.It has definitely been a whirlwind, she said."}

{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.)Good evening. Heres the latest.1. The Republican candidates zipped around South Carolina, where the race has narrowed heading into Saturdays primary. Donald J. Trumps expected victory could damage the states image of embracing diversity and, more broadly, undercut the partys attempt to appeal to nonwhite voters across the South. But a new poll shows him down to just a five-point lead on Ted Cruz, followed by a rising Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Mr. Bush campaigned with his mother, Barbara, while Mr. Cruz got support from a star of Duck Dynasty._____2. The Democratic candidates focused on Saturdays caucuses in Nevada, where Bernie Sanders now represents a real threat to Hillary Clintons once-formidable advantage. She has more to lose from a loss, and he has more to gain from a win. Should they tie, party officials offered a solution fitting for a state with billions of dollars in annual gaming revenue. The campaigns each draw once from a deck of cards. High card wins._____3. Readers and movie lovers paused to mourn the loss of Harper Lee. The author of the beloved novel To Kill a Mockingbird and its recently published, controversial sequel, Go Set a Watchman, she also helped Truman Capote with his true-crime novel In Cold Blood. All I want to be, she once told an interviewer, is the Jane Austen of South Alabama._____4. And thousands of people, including President Obama, paid respects to Justice Antonin Scalia during a daylong visitation at the Supreme Court. Republicans closed ranks against any Obama nominee. In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Senators Mitch McConnell and Charles Grassley argued that the opening of a seat in an election year afforded citizens a rare chance to decide who they trust to both lead the country and nominate the next Supreme Court justice. How often does someone from Ashland, Ky., or Zearing, Iowa, get to have such impact?_____5. The fight over a San Bernardino terrorists iPhone also intensified. The Justice Department asked the courts to compel Apple to unlock the cellphone, saying the companys resistance appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy. Apples chief executive, Tim Cook, above center, has called the demand to hack the phone a chilling attack on privacy and Internet security._____6. The U.S. said its airstrike on an Islamic State camp along Libyas Mediterranean coast probably killed a militant who drew recruits into Libya and organized two major attacks on Western tourists in nearby Tunisia over the last year._____7. A plea deal freed this 69-year-old man, who was in solitary confinement longer than any other prisoner in the country, and possibly in American history. Albert Woodfox, one of the so-called Angola 3, denied killing a 23-year-old prison guard in 1972. Asked if he would have done anything differently on the day of the murder, he said: Theres forces beyond your control. Theres not a lot you can do._____8. Miamis police union lashed out at Beyonc, calling for law enforcement organizations to boycott her April 27 concert in the city because she used this years Super Bowl halftime show to divide Americans by promoting the Black Panthers. The superstar and her dancers wore costumes that referred to the Panthers, drew attention to the fatal shooting of a black man by police officers in San Francisco and raised their fists in a black power salute._____9. Britains grocery giant, Tesco, announced that  and this is not a joke  it would no longer make curved croissants, only straight ones, because they were easier to spread with butter or jam. The curved shape is more fiddly, an official said, and most people can take up to three attempts to achieve perfect coverage, which increases the potential for accidents involving sticky fingers and tables.

{"text": "Donald Trump built his campaign on the promise to build a wall along the Mexican border. The idea is attention-grabbing (and unworkable). But the striking thing is that its not too far away from the current Republican orthodoxy.Not long ago you could be a movement conservative and be for reasonably open immigration policies. Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, Steve Forbes and George W. Bush all took open positions on immigration.But times have changed. Now you prove your conservative credentials by saying you want to deport undocumented aliens. Now you prove it by opposing higher immigration flows. Now Donald Trump brings Republican crowds to their feet by bashing the supposed criminal hordes sneaking up from Mexico.The problem with this new orthodoxy is that it is completely obsolete. Its based on a view of immigration that may have reflected 1980s realities, but that has little to do with reality today.The number of illegal immigrants flowing into this country is dropping, not rising. The flow of total immigrants peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since. The share of immigrants coming from Latin America is falling sharply. Since 2008, more immigrants have come from Asia than Latin America, and the disparity is growing.There are more Mexicans leaving the United States than coming in. According to the Pew Research Center, there was a net outflow of 140,000 from 2009 to 2014. If Trump builds his wall, hell lock more Mexican immigrants in than hell keep out.Trump plays up the alleged threat of crime committed by immigrants. But the overall evidence is clear. Immigrants make American streets safer. Roughly 1.6 percent of immigrant males between ages 18 and 39 wind up incarcerated, compared with 3.3 percent of native-born American men of the same age. Among native-born men without a high school diploma, about 11 percent are incarcerated. Among similarly educated Mexican, Guatemalan and Salvadoran men here, only 2 or 3 percent get incarcerated.One study of 103 cities between 1994 and 2004 found that violent crime rates decreased as the concentration of immigrants increased. Numerous studies have shown that a big share of the drop in crime rates in the 1990s is a result of the surge in immigration.Trump plays up the threat of terrorism. But the real threat is that our border agencies spend so much time tracking down people who want to be gardeners that they dont have the resources to track down the people who want to be suicide bombers. Fighting terrorism by going after the whole swath of immigration policy is like fighting germs with a sledgehammer.Theres a reason Republicans from Reagan to Bush supported reasonably open immigration policies. They are and have always been good for America.A new summary of the research from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that immigrants are integrating into society as well as ever. The bulk of the evidence shows that immigrants have a hugely positive effect on total American G.D.P. while having little effect on overall wages. The surge in Asian immigration will bring a gigantic number of highly skilled people, who end up with higher education levels than the American average, higher productivity levels and higher incomes.So why is the Trump message selling? Well, economic growth has been slow and wages have been stagnant (mostly because technology is displacing workers). Government is dysfunctional and the immigration issue has become a symbol for how elites are out of touch with the mainstream.But mostly its the clash of two trends: the graying of the G.O.P. and the browning of America. The Republican primary base is more and more made up of older people, who have significantly more negative views about immigration. Second, by 2044, America will be a majority-minority country. This is a very different America than the one people who grew up in the 1960s were used to. Its a historical transformation that is bound to raise very legitimate concerns.The way for Republicans to address these concerns, though, is not to build a wall and treat immigrants as suspicious alien invaders. Its to work on our legal immigration system  make the system ample and streamlined enough so that most people come here in the right way, in a way they can be vetted.Admit more skilled immigrants and fewer unskilled ones. This would be a giant boon to the economy over all. It would make our immigration policies less geared to serving the elites  giving them ample supplies of nannies and nail polishers. Reducing the supply of unskilled immigrants may do something to raise the wages of unskilled natives and ease their legitimate concerns.Donald Trumps G.O.P. is a rear-window party pining for a white America that is never coming back. Ronald Reagans G.O.P., and maybe some future G.O.P., will fix the immigration system and attract the people who will make the country innovative, dynamic and interesting for decades to come."}
{"text": "Diamond Tongues, an alternately sweet and slashing microbudget comedy from Canada, makes a great vehicle for Leah Goldstein, a musician and performance artist appearing in her first movie. As Edith, an aspiring actress who seems blind to her deficits and personal flaws, Ms. Goldstein gives a performance that requires her to swing between disarming and loathsome. She demonstrates impressive skill in slowly peeling away her characters charm.Edith scrounges for casting calls in Toronto, auditioning for such misbegotten projects as Blood Sausage, about a serial killer who turns his victims into encased meat. She seethes at friends whose successes only marginally exceed her own  giving a poor online rating to a film in which an acquaintance appears and barely concealing her jealousy of a roommate (Leah Wildman) who is preparing for a play. And although still recuperating from a breakup that she initiated, Edith is also horrified to discover her ex-boyfriend is pursuing acting ambitions of his own.Diamond Tongues vacillates between light, faintly romantic humor  her pal Nick (Nick Flanagan) is one of the many people who try to manage her expectations for stardom  and darker territory, as when Edith is taken in by an acting teacher.The prickly tone is a difficult balancing act, and Diamond Tongues may settle for being a softer-hearted film than its most cynical scenes portend. But it has a palpable affection for Torontos cultural scene and for Ms. Goldstein, who would most likely have no trouble standing out at an audition in real life."}
{"text": "Citigroup said on Thursday that it had granted its chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, a 27 percent pay raise, as the big bank crossed several hurdles on its way toward becoming a more profitable and stable company.Mr. Corbat was awarded total compensation of $16.5 million for last year, up from $13 million in 2014.In addition to his $1.5 million salary, Mr. Corbat was awarded $9 million in stock and about $6 million in a cash award.In announcing his compensation in a securities filing on Thursday, the bank said: Citi has continued to become a simpler, smaller, safer and stronger bank under Mr. Corbats leadership.For the bank, 2015 was certainly better than the previous year, when it failed the Federal Reserves annual stress test, agreed to multibillion-dollar mortgage settlements and became embroiled in a series of scandals related to its Mexican operations.Last year, Citigroup earned $17.2 billion, its highest profit since 2006. The bank continued to whittle down its bad bank, known as Citi Holdings, which holds many of Citigroups unwanted assets.As part of that paring down, Citigroup completed the sale of a subprime lending unit, called OneMain, and sold off other consumer units around the globe.Citigroup also passed its 2015 stress test, which was considered a litmus test for Mr. Corbats leadership.This year so far has been a bit rocky for Citigroup as well as for other banks. Shares of Citigroup are down nearly 24 percent since the start of the year, as investors fret about the banks exposure to the slowdown in emerging market economies and the collapse in oil prices.Mr. Corbats $16.5 million in compensation was slightly higher than the $16 million pay package that Bank of Americas chief executive and chairman, Brian T. Moynihan, received. Mr. Moynihans pay package last year was 23 percent greater than his 2014 compensation.JPMorgan Chase increased the pay package of its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, 35 percent, to $27 million last year.The pay package of Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief of Goldman Sachs, was cut for the first time since 2011. Last year, his pay was $23 million, $1 million less than he made in 2014. The compensation of Morgan Stanleys chief executive, James P. Gorman, decreased to $21 million, from $22.5 million."}
{"text": "A plant known as hairy panic has left parts of a small town in southeastern Australia overwhelmed with tumbleweeds, and global news media attention, with residents and journalists recording bizarre scenes of dry, yellow grass piling up around cars and doorways.The windblown grass has become a major nuisance in Wangaratta, in Victoria State, where some people have had to dig their way in and out of their homes, according to Australian news reports. In some cases, they removed the tumbleweeds with leaf blowers.It makes it difficult to get the car out in the morning  if you can find it, one Wangaratta resident, Jason Perna, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Images of hairy panic blanketing parts of Wangaratta were picked up by international news outlets, including the BBC and CNN, bringing an unusual amount of attention to the town with a population of 17,000.Hairy panic, formally known as Panicum effusum, is a widespread native grass in Australia that thrives in warm, dry conditions. The name Panicum does not refer to fear or anxiety, but rather to a Latin name for millet.The grass is more of an annoyance than a threat, with a chief risk to sheep and pigs, which can develop photosensitivity from overeating it (a condition known as yellow big head).Residents told the local news media that the source was most likely an untended field. They said they were trying to contact the farmer to have it mowed.Its a first-world problem, Mr. Perna told the ABC. We dont put it on the scale of any of the famine or poverty going on in the world."}
{"text": "CHARLESTON, S.C.   It is not yet clear which Republican presidential candidate will emerge from Saturdays South Carolina primary with the biggest boost. But it is becoming increasingly apparent which two would suffer most from a disappointing performance.South Carolina will render a brutal and perhaps final verdict on Jeb Bushs campaign if he does not at least finish close to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has made an all-out push here, campaigning aggressively for 10 days and bringing in his brother, former President George W. Bush, for his first public campaign speech in nearly a decade.Failing to break through, after all that, would raise fundamental questions about Mr. Bushs ability to consolidate support from mainstream Republican voters.Late Thursday, he acknowledged a mounting sense of gloom.I hope that you believe that its possible for us to do this, Mr. Bush told voters in Rock Hill as he wrapped up a town hall-style forum. I hope you dont think the end is near.Among the hard-line conservatives in the race, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will face new questions about the potential of his campaign if he is unable to broaden his appeal and continues to allow Donald J. Trump, the heavy favorite here, to cut into his support from evangelical Christians.Mr. Bush and Mr. Cruz are not seen as competing directly with each other, and their support comes from starkly different pools of voters. But for both men, the gravest danger this weekend is that they end up being overshadowed in a lasting way by their most immediate competitors, just as the primary campaign begins to spread across a wider map of states in March.Anybody who finishes below third will raise serious questions about how they go forward, former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi said when asked what was at stake for Mr. Bush. And that message will be most pronounced by those candidates donors.Mr. Bush and Mr. Cruz are plainly aware of the pressure on their candidacies here, and they are hurrying to make their cases to voters  while also showing signs of frustration.Mr. Bush has alternated between expressions of exasperation  We dont have to go vote, I guess. Its all finished. I should just stop campaigning, maybe, huh? he said Wednesday  and demonstrative pleas for support.Im going to get on my hands and knees and ask for your vote after I answer this, he told an undecided woman in Columbia on Thursday when she asked him about education policy.Mr. Cruzs performance has been just as dizzying: a spaghetti-at-the-wall medley of attacks, self-defense and spectacle. After he absorbed blows on the issue of defense, where Mr. Rubio in particular has branded him as dovish, Mr. Cruzs team hastily convened a gathering on Tuesday aboard an aircraft carrier near here, where he unveiled a set of national security proposals.On Wednesday, he mused to the news media for 40 minutes about how much he looked forward to deposing Mr. Trump, should the litigious New Yorker sue him. And on Thursday, Mr. Cruz suggested that his Texas roots left him well-positioned to understand South Carolinians.Im told people in South Carolina kind of like their guns, he said at a Republican womens club event in Greenville. I have to say, as a Texan, I understand. Remember the Alamo.For Mr. Rubio, too, much is at stake: He is seen as the candidate who has gained the most ground over the last week and is campaigning with South Carolinas popular governor, Nikki R. Haley, at his side. Polls show that Mr. Rubio remains broadly appealing to a cross-section of Republican primary voters, in South Carolina and nationally, with many voters describing him as their second choice.The same is not true for Mr. Bush, whose appeal seems confined to moderates, or for Mr. Cruz, whose popularity among strongly ideological activists has not translated into a wider national following.The race in South Carolina has illustrated Mr. Cruzs basic predicament: He has been pinched between Mr. Trumps anti-establishment legions and Mr. Rubios looser coalition of mainstream Republicans and evangelical voters.If Mr. Cruz cannot win votes outside of the hard right here, he will most likely struggle to win larger states against Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio, even in the conservative Deep South.Cruzs only path in a three-way race is to get it to a two-way, said Carl Forti, a Republican strategist.Absent strong showings Saturday, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cruz could face the embarrassing prospect of losing their home states. Mr. Bush, who has little cash left, would have a hard time even lasting until Floridas March 15 primary.Mr. Cruz would still be formidable when Texas and a host of other states vote on March 1, but an overwhelming win here by Mr. Trump would force him to spend time and money in Texas rather than strictly playing offense in conservative states like Georgia and Tennessee.William J. Miller, an influential Texas lobbyist who has not endorsed a presidential candidate, said the race in Texas could become a blowout for Mr. Trump if no one slows him in South Carolina or Nevada, which votes on Tuesday.Its his game right now, Mr. Miller said of Mr. Trump. If he sweeps it, these other candidates will get swept out, and hell come into Texas with the wind at his back.In that event, Mr. Miller said, the hard-line Mr. Cruz would find himself scrambling to get support from people who are not necessarily friends of his.Mr. Cruzs advisers argue that they have the potential to build support among several groups, most notably libertarians still casting about for a candidate since Senator Rand Paul of Kentuckys departure from the race. An ad released on Thursday, titled Nevada Land, seemed directly aimed at libertarians; it attacked Mr. Trump for refusing to say he would return federal land to Nevadas residents.For Mr. Bush, the situation is far more dire. After finishing narrowly ahead of Mr. Rubio in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush has been upstaged by him here.Mr. Bush began the week with a forceful debate performance and an energetic campaign swing with his brother, but by Wednesday, the center of attention had shifted to Mr. Rubio and his endorsement from Ms. Haley, who is appearing in a new ad for Mr. Rubio and campaigning alongside him.Mr. Bushs campaign has worked to demonstrate that he is in the race for the long haul and capable of a strong finish here. A set of talking points emailed to his supporters on Thursday, and provided to a New York Times reporter by a recipient, highlighted Mr. Bushs endorsements from South Carolinians, including Senator Lindsey Graham, and noted that Ms. Haleys endorsement of Mitt Romney in 2012 had not stopped Newt Gingrich from defeating Mr. Romney in the primary here.But Mr. Bushs problems in South Carolina go beyond Mr. Rubio. He also appears to be losing votes to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who is wooing the sort of moderates who might otherwise be in Mr. Bushs camp.Every vote he gets comes from us, Mr. Graham said of Mr. Kasich. Hes done more damage to us than Haley has helped Rubio."}

{"text": "A finely calibrated shiver of a movie, The Witch opens on a scene of religious wrath. On a New England plantation, around 1630, a true believer, William (Ralph Ineson), and his family are facing a grim assemblage. The setting is a kind of meeting house crowded with men, women and children, a congregation whose silence and unsmiling faces imply disapproval or perhaps fear. Whether theyre standing in judgment doesnt matter to William, whose arrogant faith in his own notion of Christianity is as deep and darkly unsettling as his sepulchral voice. Its the sort of soul-and-earth-quaking voice you can imagine one of the biblical patriarchs having, the kind that Abraham used on God and Isaac alike.Written and directed by Robert Eggers, The Witch  takes place in an America that in its extremes feels more familiar than its period drag might suggest. Its set a decade after the Mayflower landed in Plymouth and tracks Williams family as it leaves the plantation to settle down alone at the edge of a forest. There, the family members build a farm, grow corn and commit themselves to God, a contract tested by a series of calamities that turn this story of belief into a freak-out of doubt. As the wind stirs the trees and the children taunt one another with talk of witches, you may remember that the movies subtitle is A New-England Folktale. Something wicked this way comes?Mr. Eggers knows how to dress a room beautifully and establish a mood quickly. He has a background working on sets and costumes across the arts (his credits include Sesame Street and the theater group La MaMa), and the world he and his team conjure in The Witch is meticulous and immersive. From the start, with antiqued detail, naturalistic lighting and tightly packed bodies, he signals the claustrophobia of the plantation, where religious fanaticism meets groupthink. Within minutes Williams family is on its lonely road, an exodus that  underlined by the image of the colony gates closing  instills a tremor of anxiety. With a gentle rap-rapping, Mr. Eggers intensifies the shivers with art-film moves, genre shocks and an excellent cast that includes a progressively rowdy menagerie.At first, these creatures skitter around the edge of the story, their baaing and barking creating a homey cacophony with the giddy squeals of the familys children. From afar the farm looks as pretty as a needlepoint sampler, with its belching chimney, stacks of corn and quaintly dressed figures. Closer up, though, the scene appears harder, tougher, and so do William and his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), a pair of Grant Wood prototypes. Their pinched and planed faces make a graphic contrast with that of their eldest daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), whose peaches-and-cream complexion looks too insinuatingly succulent for a world of such punitive austerity. Even when their corn blackens  William and Katherine prove to be terrible farmers  Thomasin remains in bloom.The story of the New England Puritans is itself a folk tale thats been told, retold and fought over through generations of Thanksgiving school pageants, endless productions of The Crucible and historical revisionism. Mr. Eggers has looked elsewhere for inspiration, including period accounts like those of Cotton Mather, the Boston minister who influenced the lethal 1692 Salem Witch Trials that Arthur Miller turned into McCarthy-era theater. It wouldnt be surprising if Mr. Eggers was also familiar with The White Ribbon, Michael Hanekes 2009 film about God and patriarchy, authority and domination in Germany before World War I. There are gods and fathers in The Witch as well, even if this movie finally settles into a specifically American story about a catastrophe of faith.Good horror movies make fright palpable, which Mr. Eggers does with dependably spooky stuff like abrupt edits that fall as heavily as Williams ax and shifts in sound levels that fill silences with a choral caterwauling. But Mr. Eggerss sharpest decision, what makes you and the movie jump, is that he stays inside the characters worlds and heads, all disastrously close quarters. These are people who fervently believe both in the Devil and in God, and for whom witches are as real as trees; its no wonder that their inability to tame the New World blurs with their fears. The finale is a trip, but Mr. Eggers suggests that when crops and sanity each fail it misses the point to ask if the Devil exists. Of course he does  just read Cotton Mather or talk to the scene-stealing goat called Black Phillip.The Witch is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for toil and trouble. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes."}
{"text": "ABOARD THE PAPAL AIRLINER  Inserting himself into the Republican presidential race, Pope Francis on Wednesday suggested that Donald J. Trump is not Christian because of the harshness of his campaign promises to deport more immigrants and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border.A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian, Francis said when a reporter asked him about Mr. Trump on the papal airliner as he returned to Rome after his six-day visit to Mexico.The popes remarks came during a wide-ranging, midair news conference in which he also waded into the question of whether the Roman Catholic Church should grant an exception to its prohibitions on abortion and birth control in regions where the Zika virus is causing a public health emergency, including in much of Catholic-dominated Latin America.Researchers say pregnant women are especially at risk, noting that the virus may be responsible for a spike in cases of microcephaly, a condition in which newborns have unusually small heads and brains.In answering the question, Francis made a distinction between abortion and birth control. He flatly ruled out condoning abortion, which he described as a crime, an absolute evil. But he seemed more open to making an exception for contraception, citing Pope Paul VIs decision in the 1960s to make an emergency exception and permit nuns in the Belgian Congo to use contraceptives because they were in danger of rape.Avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil, Francis said. In certain cases, as in this one, as in that one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear. I would also urge doctors to do their utmost to find vaccines against these mosquitoes that carry this disease.Francis comments on Mr. Trump and the possibility of using contraceptives to prevent the spread of the Zika virus are certain to garner strong reactions. On Thursday, the World Health Organization advised the sexual partners of pregnant women to use condoms or abstain from sex if they live in Zika-affected areas or are returning from them.The church has long opposed the use of artificial contraceptives, a ban reaffirmed by Paul VI in his 1968 papal encyclical, Humanae Vitae. Many Catholics across Latin America and elsewhere ignore the edict, however.Francis made his remarks about Mr. Trump barely three hours after he had concluded his Mexico trip by presiding over a huge Mass in the border city of Ciudad Jurez. He first walked to the edge of the Rio Grande  as American security officers watched from the other side  to lay flowers at a new memorial commemorating those who have died trying to cross the border.Francis then celebrated Mass, as a crowd of more than 200,000 people stood barely a stones throw from the border and listened to the pope call for compassion for immigrants fleeing chaos, poverty and war.Mr. Trump has staked out controversial positions on immigration, vowing to force Mexico to build a wall and also increase deportations. He has also made inflammatory comments accusing Mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals.Asked whether he would try to influence Catholics in how they vote in the presidential election, Francis said he was not going to get involved in that but then repeated his criticism of Mr. Trump, with a caveat.I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that, Francis said. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.Mr. Trump responded immediately at a campaign rally in Kiawah Island, S.C. Discussing the Islamic State, their primary goal is to get to the Vatican.If and when the Vatican is attacked, he said, the pope would only wish and have prayed that Donald Trump would have been elected president.Earlier in his remarks, he said, I like the pope.In the days before Francis arrived at the border, Mr. Trump criticized the visit, calling the pope a political person and accusing him of acting at the behest of the Mexican government. I think that the pope is a very political person, he said.Mr. Trump, in an interview with Fox Business Network, said: I dont think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico. I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. Theyre making a fortune, and were losing.Mr. Trump is a Presbyterian and has been trying to make inroads among evangelical voters as he seeks to win the coming set of Southern primaries.Asked about the comments, Francis laughed. Thank God he said I was a politician because Aristotle defined the human person as animal politicus,  he said.So at least I am a human person, the pope said. As to whether I am a pawn, well, maybe, I dont know. Ill leave that up to your judgment and that of the people.Francis also took questions on a handful of other issues.Throughout his appearances, he spoke repeatedly about the human costs of Mexicos drug violence, yet he never met with the families of the 43 students who disappeared in Guerrero State, a case that has caused deep embarrassment for the government. Francis said that he had wanted to meet the families in Jurez, but that practicality and dissension among the families prevented a meeting from happening. Mexicos drug violence, he said, is a great pain that Im taking with me, because this country doesnt deserve this drama.Asked about the continuing problem of clerical sexual abuse, Francis defended his record despite criticism that he is not sufficiently focused on the issue. He listed the things he has done to speed up prosecution of cases in the Vaticans judicial system, but agreed that we need to work faster, because were behind with the cases.The pope made no mention of the recent controversy that erupted after an outspoken member was suspended from his duties on the special commission Francis appointed for the protection of minors. But he described clerical sex abuse as a monstrosity and said bishops who transferred abusive priests to protect them should resign.Francis noted that as soon as next month he is expected to release his much-awaited document on the theme of family, in which one topic on the table is whether divorced and civilly remarried Catholics should be allowed to receive communion. It is an acutely delicate subject within the church, and the pope ducked a direct answer. When pressed, he said that all doors are open but that the church could not simply say from here on, they can have communion.Finally, Francis was asked about recent reports about newly disclosed letters revealing the closeness of the relationship between Pope John Paul II and Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, a philosopher and author who collaborated with John Paul. Francis argued that a close friendship between a man and woman is not a sin, its a friendship. A romantic relationship with a woman who is not your wife  that is a sin. Understand?He said that popes were men but that they needed advice and friendship from women. Such relationships need not stir suspicions, he said. The pope, too, has a heart that can have a healthy, holy friendship with a woman, he said."}
{"text": "This is not Lear, said the distinguished actress and dancer Valda Setterfield. She wasnt kidding. Although those are the lines written for the title character of King Lear, the Lear that had its United States premiere at New York Live Arts on Wednesday, a collaboration between Ms. Setterfield and the Irish choreographer-director John Scott, was a reduction of Shakespeares play in many senses, only one of which could be considered positive: The show lasts not much more than an hour.Besides Ms. Setterfield, the cast numbers just three: the three men who play Lears daughters. Lear doesnt make much of this cross-gender casting, but then it doesnt make much of anything as it witlessly deploys one hackneyed Brechtian or postmodern device after another: a bit of text here, a bit of movement there. In the middle of snippets of Shakespeare, the performers address one another by their real-life names. They refer to other productions of King Lear. They manipulate pieces of paper, a kind of word cloud of the play that serves as nearly the only prop.In an attempt to give the production more contemporary relevance, Mr. Scott and Ms. Setterfield also include telephone conversations between present-day parents and children, talk of elderly parents medications and frailty, of nursing homes and busy adult children promising to visit more often. Yet the potential poignancy of this flipping of filial relationships, and its relation to Shakespeares themes, is entirely undercut by the theatrical shenanigans. The three men dont speak their lines; they screech them. The choreography  a mess of spins, posturing and angry hopping  makes the three sisters into the same brat, and when the three men play the Fool, its worse: Theyre like the Three Stooges trying to do cabaret.Amid all this, the British-born Ms. Setterfield is a balm. More regal than ever at 81, she can speak Shakespearean verse with mellifluous intelligence; a former Merce Cunningham dancer, she can invest simple pantomime with gravitas. The production doesnt take advantage of her ironic wit  as did, say, David Gordons Dancing Henry Five, a 2004 production that artfully and meaningfully used all the postmodern devices present in Lear  but she maintains her dignity. The strongest pathos that this Lear provokes is the feeling that she deserves better."}
{"text": "He has broken with many Republicans on taxing the rich, threatening trade wars and keeping Planned Parenthood alive. On Friday, Donald J. Trump faced criticism for an even bolder act of conservative heresy: embracing the core tenet of the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Trump has to date offered only bits and pieces of his health agenda, generally presenting a vow to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something great.In a town-hall meeting hosted by CNN on Thursday night, he shared some more expansive views on the subject, and unlike most Republicans he did not call for removing the individual mandate that requires Americans to have health insurance.Asked how people with pre-existing medical conditions would purchase insurance if the health law and the mandate were eliminated, Mr. Trump said, I like the mandate.So heres where Im a little bit different, he continued. I dont want people dying on the streets.Less than 24 hours later, Mr. Trump backed away from his remarks, proclaiming himself to be the fiercest opponent of the health law. It was the latest example of a candidate who has been impervious to inconsistencies again emerging unscathed from a misstep that would probably be damaging to anyone else.The Affordable Care Act has sometimes put Republicans in an awkward position on the campaign trail. While the popularity of the law remains mixed nationally, many Americans have benefited from the aspects of the legislation that would be lost if it is repealed.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas faced an uncomfortable silence in Iowa last month when a supporter of Hillary Clinton explained to him how a relative who was riddled with tumors had not had insurance before the law. While Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, like his Republican opponents, wants to repeal the law, he has also been criticized by conservatives for using it to expand Medicaid in his state.For years, President Obamas health care overhaul, and the individual mandate specifically, have been anathema to Republicans who cite it as a vivid example of government overreach.Without providing many details, Mr. Trump said this week that he would promote health savings accounts and spur interstate competition among insurance companies to reduce prices. As for patients who could still not afford insurance, Mr. Trump said, Were going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare, suggesting an expansion of that government program.Conservatives were taken aback. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who opposes Mr. Trump, said in a series of posts on Twitter that the billionaire businessman appeared to embrace most of the health law and wondered what kind of Supreme Court justices he would appoint if elected. The legality of the mandate, and the governments power to impose fines on people who ignore it, was central to the Supreme Court decision that upheld the law in 2012.Many Republicans have called Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a George W. Bush appointee, a turncoat for having written that decision. Mr. Trump has been one of the loudest.Would you nominate a Supreme Court justice who agrees with you that federal government can mandate purchasing specific products? Mr. Sasse asked Mr. Trump on Twitter.Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who has been a defender of Mr. Trump in many instances, was also incensed. And he took issue with Mr. Trumps suggestion that other Republicans are not disturbed by the idea of people dying in the street.You cant talk about repealing Obamacare and like the mandate, Mr. Limbaugh said during his show on Friday.In the face of that backlash, Mr. Trump fired back on Twitter that he had been misunderstood. He said he only liked the provision in the law that requires insurers to provide coverage for people who are already ill. He then promised that he intended to repeal the entire piece of legislation, including the mandate.The mandate underpins the law by spreading insurers risk between the young and healthy and the older part of the population that needs costlier medical care. Without that requirement, insurers have said, the market could collapse.Mr. Trumps expression of support for the mandate was not the first time that he has struck a left-leaning tone on health care. In an interview with CBS last year he said, Everybodys got to be covered and said he would cut deals with hospitals to care for people who could not afford treatment. Asked how it would be paid for, Mr. Trump responded, The governments going to pay for it.He also recently began talking about allowing the government to negotiate with drug companies to cut prices.If we negotiated the price of drugs, he said in a town hall-style debate on MSNBC this week, wed save $300 billion a year.Both Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders have called for allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of medicines with drug companies. President Obama has also sought the authority to negotiate prices for some expensive drugs through the Medicare Part D program. But he has faced fierce opposition from Republicans in Congress and pharmaceutical lobbying groups.Health care analysts have said that allowing the government to have more influence in the market this way could have unintended consequences, like suppressing drug company revenues so much that they would cut back on research. In any event, hearing the idea come from a Republican raised eyebrows.Its a proposal thats normally associated with Democrats, so for a Republican, in fact the leading Republican candidate, to say that was a surprise, said John Rother, executive director of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, an advocacy group working to cut drug prices.On Friday, Mr. Trump said that his independence on the issue was more evidence that he was not beholden to special interests and lobbyists."}

{"text": "HILLSBORO, Ohio   Senator Rob Portman, a mild-mannered Republican seeking re-election in the era of Donald J. Trump, has long pitched himself as a voice of reason in Washington. He points to his ability to work with Democrats, and even crossed party lines in voting to confirm Loretta E. Lynch as President Obamas attorney general.Now the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has him in a bind. Like other endangered Republicans in swing states  including Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Patrick J. Toomey in Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin  Mr. Portman, who is from Ohio, has vowed to block Senate consideration of any nominee to fill Justice Scalias seat.It is a stance that has put Mr. Portman, 60, whose earnest demeanor sometimes earns him plaudits even from Democrats here, in the kind of ideological showdown he usually tries to avoid. Many Democrats, Ohio newspaper editorialists and independents are outraged. But his conservative Republican base is pressing him to stand firm.Please, have a backbone like steel, Helen Hiestand, 72, who years ago worked for Mr. Portman, urged the other night, as he greeted fellow Republicans in a church gymnasium here. The senator, with characteristic understatement, replied: Im getting guff.In lining up behind the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who insists that the next president should pick Justice Scalias successor, Mr. Portman says voters deserve a chance to weigh in. He says it is common practice for the Senate not to consider lifetime appointments in the last year of a presidents term; Democrats disagree.Were in the last eight and a half months before a major election, Mr. Portman said Wednesday in an interview. We have candidates out there on both sides making their case for the direction of the country, and this seat is a critical seat.Justice Scalias death leaves the court evenly divided; his replacement could shape its decisions for a generation or more. But while Republicans have effectively told Mr. Obama not to bother sending the Senate a nominee, in interviews, many Ohio voters seemed to disagree.And Democrats are pouncing.I think Senator Portman will pay a heavy price for his irresponsible behavior, the senators likely Democratic opponent, Ted Strickland, a former Ohio governor, said in an interview. I think its a violation of his constitutional duty.Some wonder why the independent-minded Mr. Portman was so quick to fall in line behind the Republican leader. I dont know why he just didnt shut up, said Jerry Austin, a Democratic strategist here.Around the country, other first-term Republicans are also feeling the heat. In New Hampshire and Wisconsin, newspaper editorial boards had harsh words for Ms. Ayotte and Mr. Johnson; in Pennsylvania, a news article in Mr. Toomeys home paper suggested he was misstating the facts around past nominations in election years.In Ohio, Mr. Portman is clearly weighing a complex calculation. He is a former House member who served as trade representative and budget director under President George W. Bush, and his efforts at bipartisanship help him at home. But he is seeking a second term amid a raucous Republican presidential primary campaign; a nominee like Mr. Trump, or Senator Ted Cruz, the conservative Texan, could hurt him badly in Ohio, whose voters twice backed Mr. Obama. He must court independents, yet still satisfy his conservative base.This is a hard one, and Portmans not the only one with a problem, said Jennifer E. Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Hes keeping his base intact, but it could create a larger problem for him in the general election by alienating some moderates and independents.Here in Hillsboro, a city of about 6,600 people surrounded by snow-blanketed farmland east of Cincinnati, his mandate from the base seems clear. Nearly 200 enthusiastic conservatives, many wearing red, white and blue, turned out for Mr. Portman at the Highland County Republican Partys Lincoln Day dinner.The presidential campaign was on everyones mind; attendees voted in a straw poll by dropping corn kernels in Mason jars with photos of the candidates. (Senator Marco Rubio of Florida won, with 44 kernels, followed by Mr. Trump and John R. Kasich, the Ohio governor, who tied with 36 each.) But the court was on everyones mind, too.The Constitution says he should, and he should, said Kay Ayres, 78, a retired cattle farmer and the county partys executive chairwoman, when asked if Mr. Obama would be right to nominate someone. The Constitution doesnt say that the Senate has to hurry on and get it done.But two hours away in the small Ohio city of Delaware, sentiments were more muddled. Delaware, birthplace of the nations 19th president, Rutherford B. Hayes, is heavily Republican though not Portman territory; many voters said they had not heard of the senator. As for the court, some saw no reason to delay. And some were just disgusted with Washington.Its not like this is Obamas last day; this is just political, said Genti Koci, an Albanian-American, who admired Justice Scalia and likes Mr. Kasich for president, but voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. I dont see any good reason to wait another year, when were not even sure whos going to win.Nationally, polls show that the country is evenly divided, with Democrats supporting confirmation this year, and Republicans preferring to wait. Republican and Democratic strategists say it is too soon to tell whether the fight over Justice Scalias replacement will change the outcome of Senate races, but it will certainly energize each partys base.For Mr. Portman, a Supreme Court hearing could be particularly problematic. He was among a handful of Senate Republicans  including Ms. Ayotte and Mr. Johnson  who voted to confirm Attorney General Lynch, who is said to be on Mr. Obamas short list for the Supreme Court. She would make history as the first black female nominee, and it could be deeply uncomfortable for swing-state Republicans to vote against her.So while Mr. Strickland, the former governor, faces a primary challenge, he is hammering away at Mr. Portmans stance on replacing Justice Scalia. Youd better believe Im talking about this, he said .Mr. Portman is trying not to take the bait. In Hillsboro, he emphasized other issues, among them jobs, the threat from the Islamic State and Ohios heroin epidemic, never once mentioning the justices death.Reminded that Democrats say he is playing politics with the court, Mr. Portman bristled, insisting no one knows how the presidential election will turn out.I think its best for the country, he said. Let the politics fall where they might."}
{"text": "Last year, I wrote several columns about Donald J. Trumps record as a businessman. Far from mastering The Art of the Deal  the title of his 1987 best seller  Trump made real estate blunders that turned billions in potential profits into mere millions. His foray into Atlantic City brought him perilously close to personal bankruptcy. As for all his claims about owning a sprawling business empire, what he actually runs these days is a licensing company that slaps the Trump name on everything from buildings to steaks to an education company that was sued by New York State in 2013 for persistent fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct. My conclusion  and I say this as a grizzled veteran of business journalism  was that Trumps business acumen (not to mention his net worth) was wildly overstated, not least by Trump himself. His core business skill is self-promotion.It occurred to me, though, that there was one episode of his business life I had overlooked. In 1984 and 1985, Trump owned the New Jersey Generals, who competed in the short-lived United States Football League. It is worth recalling for what it can tell us about the way Trump makes decisions, hires key people, works (or doesnt work) for the greater good and so on. Not to blow the punch line, but it is not much of an exaggeration to say that once Trump got his hands around this promising idea, he basically strangled it.The key concept behind the U.S.F.L. was that it would play football in the spring. Football fans, the leagues creators believed, wanted to watch their sport year-round, but, alas, they could not: The N.F.L. season ended with the Super Bowl and did not restart until preseason games in August. In the spring, we had football all to ourselves, recalled Tad Taube, an owner of the Oakland Invaders.Although the owners lost money  as you would expect in a new business venture  the league had a surprisingly successful first season. It landed television contracts with ABC and a fledgling sports network called ESPN. Its ratings were decent. Its 12 teams averaged over 25,000 people per game. For a four-and-a-half-month-old baby, the U.S.F.L. has done quite well, Jim Spence, a senior vice president at ABC Sports, told The New York Times in July 1983. The network, he added, was satisfied with the ratings.U.S.F.L. fans saw the league as an exciting alternative to the button-down N.F.L. It was the fun league, said the sportscaster Charley Steiner, who called the New Jersey Generals games. It was a league that allowed players to celebrate touchdowns to their hearts content; a league where run-and-gun offenses were the norm; a league that included such innovations as the 2-point conversion and the penalty challenge.Although the owners had agreed to an informal salary cap, when Herschel Walker, the Heisman Trophy winner, decided to go pro after his junior year at Georgia (an unheard-of move at the time), the Generals signed him to a big contract: $5 million for three years. With transplanted N.F.L. players sprinkled throughout the league, as well as stars signed out of college  Reggie White, Jim Kelly, Steve Young and many others  the quality of play was surprisingly high.But the owners made two early mistakes. Eager to recoup some of their losses, they decided to expand to 18 teams for their second season, allowing them to pocket franchise fees of $4 million per team from the six new owners. It was too much too soon; from that point on, franchises folded, merged, moved  it bordered on chaos. And second, they let the Generals owner, an Oklahoma oilman named J. Walter Duncan, sell the team to Trump. The price was reported to be $9 million. (Trump later claimed it was only $5 million.)Though he had bought into a spring football league, Trump made it plain from the get-go that he thought spring football was for losers. If God had wanted football in the spring, he wouldnt have created baseball, he said.Despite having the leagues best running back in Walker, the Generals had a poor first season, going 6-12. Trump set about changing that in a manner reminiscent of another famous New York sports owner, George Steinbrenner. He signed quarterback Brian Sipe from the Cleveland Browns, as well as other veteran N.F.L. players. His spending spree blew the doors off any hope of salary restraint, forcing other U.S.F.L. teams  and the N.F.L., too  to spend millions to keep up with him.For Trump, it worked out splendidly: The team was 14-4 in its second season, but lost in the first round of the playoffs. The Generals gave Trump something else: newspaper headlines. He was not yet a household name, though he was clearly on his way. Owning the Generals turbocharged his rise to fame. His views, his deals, his postgame comments  they dominated the news medias coverage of the U.S.F.L.At first, many of the owners were glad to have him play this role because it put a spotlight on the new league. But many U.S.F.L. observers soon came to believe that he did not necessarily have the best interests of the league at heart. He was a dynamic figure, but he was dynamic on behalf of the Donald Trump interests, not the whole league, said Keith Jackson, who broadcast U.S.F.L. games for ABC.It was all self-aggrandizement, said Mike Tollin, who, as the head of a firm that served as the in-house production company for the league, spent a great deal of time in Trumps company  but who was also close to owners who soured on Trump.All through that second season, Trump continued to publicly push his fellow owners to move the U.S.F.L. to the fall and go toe-to-toe with the mighty N.F.L. It made no sense. Until the U.S.F.L. achieved parity on the field  and that was a long way off  it had no hope of attracting large numbers of fans and robust TV ratings in the fall. The networks airing its games expected it to play a spring schedule. Its network contracts called for the U.S.F.L. to keep a certain number of teams in major media markets. But how realistic was it to expect the Chicago Blitz to compete financially with the Chicago Bears? To go head-to-head with them was insane, the actor (and Tampa Bay Bandits partner) Burt Reynolds told Tollin, who made an ESPN documentary about the U.S.F.L. in 2009.Years later, when Tollin interviewed Trump for the film, Trump described the league as small potatoes. (That line became the title of the documentary.) As he has all his life, Trump yearned to be in the big arena, and in sports, there was nothing bigger than the N.F.L. Rather than seeing the genuine possibility of building a stand-alone league by steering clear of the N.F.L.  and hitching its wagon to ESPN, which itself was not ready for the N.F.L.  his model was the A.F.L., which had ultimately forced a merger with the older league.Would a merger mean that the more fragile U.S.F.L. franchises would be tossed aside? Sure. But that wouldnt happen to the Generals! In the middle of Trumps lobbying effort, Trumps main opponent among the owners, the Tampa Bay Bandits John Bassett, found out that he had brain cancer. With the respected Bassett suddenly sidelined, Trump persuaded a majority of the owners to throw in their lot with him.He manipulated them, Chuck Pitcock, a former Bandits guard, told Tollin. There were four or five of the owners that were broke, and they figured if they rode with Donald, they might end up with something. Before the 1985 season began, the league announced that it would move to the fall in 1986.I felt it was the wrong decision, Taube told me, and he wasnt the only one. The declaration to move to the fall, said Young, who was quarterback of the Los Angeles Express, I think everyone sensed that that was not going to go well.The third season was a debacle. Despite having a very good quarterback in Sipe, Trump could not resist signing Boston Colleges Doug Flutie, for $8.2 million over six years. Flutie was erratic, and though Walker rushed for almost 2,500 yards, the team wound up 11-7. A furious ABC withheld much of its rights fees, while ESPN demanded that its contract be negotiated. The league violated its TV agreements by allowing franchises to move to smaller media markets without N.F.L. teams  which they did to make themselves more attractive in the event of a merger. Attendance dropped, as did TV ratings. The losses mounted.How was Trump planning to dig the U.S.F.L. out of a hole he had largely created? Litigation, of course! The U.S.F.L. would sue the N.F.L. for being an illegal monopolist. Among other things, the lawsuit charged that the N.F.L., by having TV contracts with the three major networks (this was pre-Fox), was preventing the U.S.F.L. from signing a television deal for a fall season. It asked for $1.32 billion in damages, which in an antitrust case are trebled if the plaintiffs win. That would be more than enough not only to sustain the league, but also to enrich its beleaguered owners.Trump then made his next mistake, bringing on a flamboyant lawyer named Harvey D. Myerson  Heavy Hitter Harvey, the news media called him, a blustery, cigar-smoking, fancy-footwork kind of lawyer, as Taube put it to me. Trump hired Myerson with great fanfare, saying hes aggressive, hes tough-skinned and he knows how to win.(Myerson, who died in February, spent time in federal prison for overbilling clients, after his firm, Myerson and Kuhn, imploded spectacularly in 1989. The Kuhn in the firms name, by the way, was Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner, who fled to Florida to evade $3 million that creditors said he personally owed. But I digress.)Alas, Heavy Hitter Harvey knew next to nothing about antitrust, which requires deep, specialized knowledge. His damages theory was, in Taubes words, pie in the sky. And the N.F.L.s lawyers found plenty of proof that the U.S.F.L.s problems were largely of its own making. According to a memoir written by Robert B. Fiske Jr., who was the lead lawyer for the N.F.L., the evidence included a memo Taube had written to his fellow owners, quoting Pogos famous line, We have met the enemy, and he is us.If you are a sports fan of a certain age, you surely remember how that trial ended. The jury found that the N.F.L.s monopolistic practices had indeed injured the U.S.F.L. Then came the coup de grce: It awarded damages of one dollar. Trebled, that came to $3. With interest, it was $3.76.The U.S.F.L. appealed, claiming that the trial judge should have excluded some of the most damning evidence against it. The appeals court rejected that argument, writing, Courts do not exclude evidence of a victims suicide in a murder trial. Needless to say, the U.S.F.L. never played another down.When Tollin interviewed Trump for his documentary, he laid out the criticism he had heard from the many people he had spoken to. Trump, of course, was having none of it. He denigrated his critics, by name, and accepted zero responsibility for the leagues demise.I got this league to go as far as it could go, Trump said. Without me, this league would have folded a lot sooner.Some things never change."}
{"text": "The last time I heard the Budapest Festival Orchestra play in New York, its longtime conductor and music director, Ivan Fischer, had prepared a little joke: In the middle of one of Dvoraks Slavonic Dances, a percussionist walked past his colleagues to the front of the stage, settled down on a soloists bench set up there and reached into his jacket for a mallet and a tiny brass bell. Then he joined in the music, adding little pealing accents that suddenly seemed like the works main feature.Ive long admired Mr. Fischer for the creativity, humor and whimsy he brings to performances. But on Thursday night, when the Budapest players presented music by Weber, Liszt and Prokofiev at Carnegie Hall, the genie seemed to have escaped the bottle.Here, too, a percussion player took a front-row seat. But in Liszts Piano Concerto No. 1, which the pianist Marc-Andr Hamelin performed with somewhat disconcerting, bipolar power, the prominent triangle part is already so extensive that the 19th-century critic Eduard Hanslick mockingly called the work a triangle concerto. The percussionist Laszlo Herboly played it with an aggressive gusto that seemed intent on proving Hanslick right.Mr. Hamelin, meanwhile, emphasized the works extremes, with a hard-edged, almost brutal sound in the works martial moments, and world-weary delicacy in the lyrical ones. The only way I could reconcile them into an integrated interpretation was as an indictment of Liszts caddish flirtation with military metaphors.Perhaps that was the evenings hidden agenda. The concert opened with Webers overture to Der Freischtz and ended with Prokofievs Symphony No. 5. A written note emphasized that these works had in common an immediate popularity, a faint excuse for a program if ever there was one. But they are also war horses in a more basic sense of the word: All three play with military symbols. With jingoistic populism rife on both sides of the Atlantic these days, Mr. Fischer may have sought to make a statement.Unfortunately, the orchestras playing only muddled the message. Yes, the strings still have a warm, generous sound, and the wind section is stocked with highly gifted players. But coordination was off in many instances; tutti outbursts were loud and metallic. In the symphonys luscious Adagio, the first violins played the melody with sugared intensity, but the little trembling arpeggios that accompany them failed to speak.The most successful moment was the second movement, in which Mr. Fischer found the perfect balance between forward thrust and a relaxed, gleeful playfulness."}
{"text": "NEWARK   The Islanders best goaltender for the past two weeks  if not the past two months  pulled on a blue baseball cap and plopped on a stool near a corner of the bench. Thomas Greiss had earned the night off. Jaroslav Halak would have to bail out the Islanders.Only 10 months ago, Halak was the goaltender largely responsible for helping the Islanders make the playoffs, but he had been slumping lately. On Friday, in a tight, grinding game that felt like the postseason, Halak reverted to form, lifting the Islanders to a 1-0 victory over the Devils at Prudential Center.I dont think he was lacking confidence, Islanders Coach Jack Capuano said, but he was just so frustrated with himself.Halak stopped 27 shots for his third shutout of the season and the 39th of his career and, more important to the Islanders, ended a skid in which he won only one of five starts. Before a 3-2 overtime loss Thursday to Washington, Greiss had won his previous three starts.After giving up six goals on 28 shots in only two periods in a 6-3 loss at Carolina on Feb. 13, Halak was replaced by Greiss, who started the last two games, beating the Detroit Red Wings on Monday and then taking the N.H.L.-leading Capitals into overtime.You just have to forget about it, Halak said. Nothing you can do about the past. Its how you react the next game.Halak made his best save with 17 minutes 40 seconds left in regulation, when he stopped a point-blank shot by forward Lee Stempniak with his right pad. Stempniak had received a touch pass from center Adam Henrique and faced a half-open net.Halak also acknowledged he had gotten lucky. Nine minutes into the game, Devils forward Reid Boucher swerved into the Islanders zone and took a shot that Halak said had bounced off a goal post, though Halak was credited with a save.Tonight, we didnt get what we deserved, Devils Coach John Hynes said.After missing the Islanders first four games with an injury, Halak played in 20 of the next 31 games, with Greiss, making $1 million this year compared with Halaks $4.75 million, as the backup. But Halak was reinjured, and Greiss outplayed him when he came back.While Halak won three of 10 games, Greiss won seven of 10. When the Islanders tangled Thursday in Brooklyn with the Capitals, Greiss was in goal.On Friday, the Islanders (31-19-7) pitched in defensively, amassing enough firepower to test the Devils and goaltender Cory Schneider, who made 23 saves. The Devils (29-23-7), who play at Washington on Saturday, lost their second straight game after winning three in a row.Youre not going to win many games not scoring a goal, Hynes said.The Islanders pugnacious fourth line helped out Halak by shoving the puck away from him immediately after the opening face-off, firing three shots at Schneider by the time 14 seconds had elapsed. The Islanders, who have won five of their last seven games, then took a 1-0 lead at 1:59.Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy powered past defenseman David Schlemko and tested Schneider with a heavy shot that Schneider kicked aside. But Casey Cizikas beat defenseman John Moore to the rebound.The puck popped off Cizikass left leg and sailed past a startled Schneider. A review determined that Cizikas had not used a distinct kicking motion to score, so he was awarded his sixth goal of the season. The Islanders have won 21 of 28 games when scoring first.We werent trying anything pretty, Cizikas said. We just went hard out there.With five minutes left in the second period, they got another big chance when Devils forward Jordin Tootoo clobbered Islanders defenseman Johnny Boychuk into the boards, earning a game misconduct.The Islanders play their next six games on the road. They appear to have two good goalies again, though Halak said he had lots of help.It seemed like we didnt give them anything, Halak said."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Trump Fires Back at Sharp Rebuke by Pope Francis (front page, Feb. 19):It is surprising how quickly the words of John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic president, have been forgotten, by Pope Francis no less.At the height of the 1960 campaign, Kennedys religion and the influence the Vatican might have on the conduct of his presidency if he was elected became a real issue in the campaign.The future president said, I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote.This is exactly what Pope Francis did when, as you report, he suggested that Donald Trump is not Christian in proposing deportations and a wall to ward off migrants from Mexico.It was improper for the pope to insert himself in the American electoral process, to the detriment of any particular candidate, in this case Mr. Trump, regardless of the popes humanitarian concern for the plight of the illegal immigrant.MICHAEL B.

{"text": "CHINO HILLS, Calif.  The best high school boys basketball team in the country scores at a video-game clip of 99.6 points per outing, and it does not wait around to see if opponents can keep up. During a holiday tournament in December, it beat an opponent from Milwaukee by scoring 125 points. The next night, it poured in 124 against a challenger from metro Atlanta.But numbers are only part of the remarkable story of this seasons Chino Hills Huskies.Three of the teams starters are brothers, with a surname that could not be more apt  Ball  and matching commitments to play in college at U.C.L.A. The oldest, Lonzo, ranks among the countrys top high school talents, and the youngest, the 14-year-old freshman LaMelo, would be an eighth grader had he not started school a year early to fulfill his fathers dream of seeing his three sons overlapping for a high school season.Still, it is how the Huskies (28-0) are winning  by deploying as few as six players who defy the concept of fatigue with a full-time, full-court press  that may be the most impressive part of their season. That and those numbers.There was the 89-point win on opening night, the 74-point triumph two months later, and the time the Huskies scored 85 points in a 16-minute half. With possessions that start and end in the blink of an eye, thanks to the Balls seemingly telepathic connection, Chino Hills Coach Steve Baik concedes that his task has never been easier. Resisting the core instincts of any coach, he has let the reins on the Huskies go slack on offense and essentially green lights his players to shoot at will.I dont have to micromanage, he said.The result is quite a spectacle. In that holiday tournament in Palm Springs, Calif., the mere presence of Chino Hills created such a buzz that as many as 500 spectators were turned away at the door. The tardy arrivals missed the Huskies scoring no fewer than 96 points in their four games over five days.I cant think of any other team that is remotely in the same category, said Jason Hickman, national basketball editor at the high school sports website MaxPreps, which sponsored the tournament. Its really an unbelievable story.Most scouting services regard Lonzo Ball, a lanky 6-foot-6 guard, as one of the best seniors in the country. He will be the first Ball to enroll at U.C.L.A., but he may not stay long enough to be reunited there with LiAngelo, a 6-5 junior, and the 5-10 LaMelo. (A fourth Ball, the brothers cousin Andre, is a backup on the roster.)At a casual practice in the Huskies 1,300-seat gym before their postseason opener on Friday, which they later won, the Balls particular personalities were on full display. Lonzo, nursing an injured finger, exuded a seniors maturity, his motion economized in a low-key scrimmage. The burly LiAngelo, practicing with the intensity of the football player that he once was, jumped up from an interview as the scrimmage wound down and insisted that it continue with him. The wispy LaMelo, a design cut into his two-tone hair, acted every bit the youngster that he is, sprawling in exaggeration as if hurt and pouting when urged to get up.Before the season, Baik was conflicted on whether to dictate the offense as coaches do or cede considerable control to the Balls. One of his assistants, acquainted with the boys since their childhood, persuasively made the case for allowing them to approximate the unrestrained style of play associated with Amateur Athletic Union teams. They were effective on that level when playing alongside other Huskies, and the approach transferred seamlessly to Baiks team.It was something ingrained in them since when they were young, Baik said. Theyre just so good at doing it, weve just embraced it.Court-length passes are welcomed. Long-distance field-goal attempts are not so much tolerated as encouraged. LaMelo claims he has missed from 30 feet only to hear an unexpected command from the bench: Keep shooting.These guys are so fearless, Baik said, they dont think a 40-footer is a bad shot.Still, Baik imposes himself intermittently. There have been difficult discussions with the Balls, he said, when milking the clock to protect a lead was the wiser tactic. In the 1-point win that saw Chino Hills unseat the previous No. 1-ranked team, Floridas Montverde Academy, in December, impatience caused the Huskies to nearly fritter away a lead of 14 points.Still, Baik said he is at ease with rolling the ball out and attaching only a few strings to it.Its a simple system, he said. Its a matter of committing to it.But it is not for everyone. Baik said that he fields inquiries from other coaches about how to implement the pedal-to-the-metal format, but he tells most of the callers, You cant emulate what we do because you dont have the personnel.Meaning, they do not have three fitness fanatics driven by a personal trainer, a 6-foot-6 former football standout, LaVar Ball, who doubles as their father. (The Balls 6-foot-tall mother, Tina, is a former college basketball player.)Near the Balls residence is an incline that they call The Hill. The standard workout for the brothers consists of a mile jog on flat ground, followed by six timed sprints up the slope. A typical week contains three days of running and two more lifting weights in the family garage. Some sessions are required even after a strenuous practice under Baik.The brothers maintain that they do not plead for relief at home.Running is good for you, LiAngelo said.That endurance enables Baik to get by with a short bench. The Balls commonly play start to finish in contested games, even if that means Baik is subjected to complaints about running up scores.Equally impressive is their instinctive communication on the court. Lonzo has fetched rebounds and, with his back to the Huskies basket, blindly flung over-the-head passes downcourt, knowing LiAngelo or LaMelo would be there to receive them.Directing it all has been Baik, 37, a Pasadena, Calif., native whose rise has been as uncommon as that of Chino Hills High, a 15-year-old public school riding high in a sports realm long dominated by private schools. Baik rarely sees fellow Asian-Americans at coaching clinics, conventions or on opposing benches. As a youngster, he said, he often was told you are not supposed to be playing basketball simply because of his ethnicity.Entering his teens, Baik elected to focus on tennis. But one day, he finished off a forehand and dropped his racket after being struck by the realization that his love for the sport was lacking. He headed directly to a basketball court, and now said he relishes dispensing advice to younger Asian-Americans entering the profession.Its definitely surreal, he said of the season.In the team huddle before his team faced Montverde this season, Baik surprised himself by becoming teary-eyed.What am I doing here? he thought. A little-known school from Chino Hills?Then he told the Huskies that they belonged. Two hours later, they had earned the No. 1 ranking. Two months later, everyone knows who they are."}
{"text": "When Donald Trump is in the news, its often because of something he has said about someone else, but on Thursday it was the other way around.When the news broke that Pope Francis had suggested that Mr. Trump was not Christian, those of us who, for better or worse, have decided to get into the business of cataloging all Mr. Trumps insults did what we normally do  we went to his Twitter page and refreshed it frequently.Mr. Trump did hit back at His Holiness, calling Francis criticisms disgraceful and unbelievable, in what the The New York Timess Patrick Healy described as his most audacious attack yet on a revered public figure. Mr. Trump also described Francis as a pawn of the Mexican government.But he did not do these things on Twitter. Facebook got the honor. And, as real as an insult may be, rules are rules: If it doesnt happen on Twitter, it doesnt go on our big board. (Readers from Brussels, which Mr. Trump described as a hellhole, may sympathize.)Among insults that count, it was still a busy week for Mr. Trump.This weeks tally: three presidential candidates (two current, one former), two political organizations, two Fox News employees, one newspaper, one poll, one media organization, one television personality and one sitting president.Few things compare with the newsworthiness of insulting the pope, but there were still some highlights. Three new victims made the list this week, bringing our count to 199.First, Mr. Trump found fault with the Republican National Committee. They did a terrible job of ticket distribution for the Republican debate in South Carolina, he said.Mr. Trump also called Brit Hume, a political analyst for Fox News, a know nothing, and described a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll as phony and a joke! (Polls are a common subject for Mr. Trumps tweets, but usually they showcase his large leads.)Otherwise, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz took up most of Mr. Trumps energy this week, with about half of his insults directed at one of the two presidential candidates."}
{"text": "The unlicensed teenage driver who was fleeing the police when he ran down a 4-year-old girl, Ariel Russo, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan was sentenced on Friday to at least three years in prison for involuntary manslaughter.The driver, Franklin Reyes Jr., 19, hung his head and closed his eyes tightly when the girls mother, Sofia Russo, told the court that Ariels death in June 2013 had devastated her family, robbing them of a smart, joyous child who loved wearing skirts, making doll clothes from old socks and going to ballet classes.Why is it you get to be here, living, breathing, part of the world, when Ariel is not? Ms. Russo asked, her voice quivering in the hushed courtroom. She said she hoped Mr. Reyes would contemplate his act in prison and speak out against reckless driving after he had finished his sentence.I believe that if you are still here, then you owe it to Ariel, who lost her precious life because of your choices, to make a difference and use this tragedy to save lives, she said.Mr. Reyes read a short apology, saying he would carry the pain of what he had done for the rest of his life. I never wanted to hurt anybody, he said. I am extremely sorry.In March 2015, Mr. Reyes pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter and other charges in return for a promised sentence of three to nine years. The plea ended a protracted prosecution that was interrupted by new charges that, while out on bail, Mr. Reyes had again driven a car and fled from the police, injuring an officer.Justice Gregory Carro of State Supreme Court in Manhattan stuck to the promised sentence on Friday, over the objections of a prosecutor, David Nasar, who had urged the court to give Mr. Reyes the maximum of five to 15 years on the manslaughter charge.Ariel was killed when Mr. Reyes, who was 17 and driving with only a learners permit, raced away from officers who had pulled him over in his family car for making an illegal turn. He jumped a curb at 97th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, barreling into Ariel and her grandmother, Katia Gutierrez.The crash was one of several pedestrian fatalities in Manhattan that led to increasing calls from traffic safety advocates for tougher enforcement of vehicle laws and punishment for offenders. From the start of his administration, Mayor Bill de Blasio has made reducing such deaths a major goal, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has taken a hard line, seeking manslaughter convictions in several similar cases.While out on bail, Mr. Reyes was arrested again last June on charges that he and his father had looted a Manhattan apartment.Two months later, the police said, he was again found driving without a license. As a police officer reached through the window to try to turn off the car, prosecutors said, Mr. Reyes hit the gas and dragged the officer 100 feet down the street. In early September, having been put in jail, he tried to escape from officers when they took him to a hospital after he complained about having chest pains.Justice Carro said Mr. Reyes provided a stark example of what can occur when a civilian doesnt submit to law enforcement authorities. The judge said he was still stunned that Mr. Reyes, facing manslaughter charges, had gotten behind the wheel a second time and had again fled the police and injured someone. That is kind of a window into his soul, as to how he feels, he said.The judge said Mr. Reyess flouting of the law was the reason he had not let him be treated as a youthful offender, which would have reduced his sentence and expunged his record.Then Justice Carro spoke to Ms. Russo from the bench, saying there was little he could do to ease the familys pain. Mom, he said, that bright spark you spoke of about still shines from above.Ariels grandmother, Katia Gutierrez, also spoke at the sentencing, walking with a cane from her seat to address the court. She said that Ariel had loved to be read to at bedtime and that she had been the dancer of the house. Ms. Gutierrez said that each day she wished it had been her who had died instead of her granddaughter.This was no accident, she said to Mr. Reyes. For me there is no time that you can ever serve that will make up for the immense damage you have caused.Standing on the courthouse steps, Ariels parents, Sofia and Alan Russo, said they would fight to make sure the parole board did not let Mr. Reyes out of prison until he had served nine years. They said they had also formed a group, Families for Safe Streets, to lobby for stricter traffic safety laws.Do I think nine years is enough? Ms. Russo said. No. Do I think his apology was sincere? It was, honestly, too little, too late."}
{"text": "Theres a growing risk that credit woes will incite banklike runs on bond mutual funds.Thats the message from the latest in a series of studies from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on how market liquidity has changed since the crisis. In two investigations, New York Fed researchers lay out a situation that shows how fire sales caused by problems at some funds could lead to losses that are broader than a decade ago.Some will blame new regulations that have curtailed the ability of investment banks to act as middlemen. Its a weak argument, though, and one that the New York Fed tackled in a separate study last October.Instead, according to the authors of the new studies, on of which is titled Are asset managers vulnerable to a fire sale? the problem has three causes. First, funds are larger. Second, they hold a bigger concentration of illiquid assets. Third, investors are acting in a more skittish manner, selling earlier and in greater amounts than in the past.That all makes sense, but it also misses a broader point. Mutual funds and their managers have not evolved with the times. The more assets they hold  especially in a low-rate environment where they snap up riskier, harder-to-sell securities in a hunt for returns  the more important it is to ensure that they have ample liquidity to cope with a problem.The first line of defense is cash. Most tend to hold up to 7 percent of assets, more than enough to cover the 5 percent redemptions over three months in the 1994 market rout. In 2008, however, some funds lost up to 20 percent. And jumpy bondholders are likely to run through the rainy-day stash pretty quickly.Another option is to prevent investors from taking money out at will. That practice compounds the problem, especially with the less liquid holdings  like real estate  in a fund. Money managers could even start hawking products that remove investor-driven runs, like closed-end funds.Such measures would neither eliminate all risk nor prevent all losses. It would, however, reduce the pain for the funds and financial system alike."}

Major indexes ended their best week of the year.The Nasdaq rose about 0.4 percent, helped by a 7 percent jump in the chip equipment provider Applied Materials after the company gave a strong profit and revenue forecast for the current quarter.Buoyed by big gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, the major indexes posted their best weekly performances this year, with the Nasdaq recording its strongest week since July.The S.&P. 500 lost 0.05 points, ending roughly flat, at 1,917.78. The Nasdaq composite added 16.89 points, or 0.38 percent, to 4,504.43. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.44 points, or 0.13 percent, to 16,391.99.The S.&P. 500 gained 2.8 percent for the week, its best weekly performance since November; but it remains down 6.2 percent for the year.Advances in oil and equity prices this week were sparked by moves by oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, to cap output, but a record buildup in U.S. crude oil stockpiles kindled worries over persisting global oversupply.The commoditys price fell 4 percent on Friday as record high U.S. crude stockpiles heightened supply concerns, and the S.&P. energy sector ended down 0.4 percent.We have seen oil come back off and that has put some pressure on the market, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. Some of these earnings that we have gotten out of the past couple of days from retailers have not exactly been confidence inspiring.Brent crude oil futures slumped 3.7 percent to settle at $33.01 a barrel. U.S. crude settled down 3.7 percent at $29.64, but was up 1.1 percent for the week.U.S. underlying inflation in January rose by the most in nearly four and a half years, according to Labor Department data on Friday, suggesting the Federal Reserve could gradually raise interest rates this year as forecast in December.We have had a lot of very concerning economic data in the first six weeks of the year, and I think over the last few weeks we have seen a significant improvement in that data, said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware.However, after similar comments from other Fed officials in the past week, the president of the Cleveland Fed, Loretta Mester, said on Friday that interest rates would probably need to remain accommodative for some time, while other officials maintain that weak inflation and global turbulence are enough reasons to pause on further hikes.While the data have been a mixed bag, fears of a recession have been overblown, said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares lost 0.7 percent, weighed by weakness in oil, bank and auto shares, but was still up nearly 4 percent for the week. MSCIs index of world shares was 0.25 percent lower, but was up 3.7 percent for the week, its best since October.The Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar to $112.68 and the euro rose against the greenback also, trading up 0.2 percent at $1.1018. The U.S. dollar dipped against an index of major currencies.Other corporate earnings reports dragged on stocks. Nordstrom shares dropped 6.7 percent after the department store operators quarterly profit missed expectations.

{"text": "Successful sellers on eBay know certain things matter: item description, appealing photos, strong seller ratings and, of course, price.Now, a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances suggested another factor might make a subtle difference: whether the seller is a man or woman. Using data supplied by the company, researchers analyzed some 630,000 auction transactions on eBay in the United States and reported that, on average, when men and women with equal selling reputations sold the same products, women received lower prices than men.The difference was far less pronounced for used items: Women sellers received about 97 cents for every dollar men received. But with new items, where the authors say direct comparison is easier, women received about 80 cents on average for every dollar men sellers received.The basic point  that people have different expectations of women versus men and so we treat them very differently in the world  its fascinating and depressing, said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study.On eBay, wow, she added, noting eBays fame as a forum where anyone can sell anything. It also does not require that sellers identify their gender. This would be kind of the best example where you would think that discrimination would be at its smallest. So we can interpret these data as a lower bound of what we can expect in other environments.The study did not paint a universally negative picture for women. For some items, like toys and pet products, women received somewhat higher prices than men. And women tended to have better reputations as sellers, although they tended to have less selling experience.Nor did the study, which controlled for seller reputation, experience, number of photos, use of bold lettering and other elements, indicate that buyers were actively or even consciously discriminating. Male and female buyers appeared to treat women sellers the same, the authors said.We actually think that most of it is unconscious, said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a professor of law and sociology at Tel Aviv University, who conducted the study with Tali Regev, an economist at IDC Herzliya. The fact is that most of us have biases. We hold them unconsciously, and it makes it difficult to change.Besides analyzing actual eBay transactions, the researchers conducted an experiment to see if people could tell the gender of sellers from user profiles. People guessed correctly in 1,127 of 2,000 cases, wrong in 170 and did not know the rest.In another experiment, the researchers asked people to place value on a $100 Amazon gift card sold by someone named either Alison or Brad. On average, Alisons gift card was valued at $83.34, while Brads was valued at $87.42.Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and expert on gender wage gaps, said the study was intriguing but needed more analysis. Just perceiving that somebodys a woman, what exactly does it mean? she asked. Its got to mean something about the quality of the good or service or something thats not captured in the data that they have.Without that additional information, Dr. Goldin said her hunch is that the majority of people would be bidding less if they thought that, This really isnt a 1948 Rolex or This really isnt Jackie Robinsons signature. The researchers said eBay allowed them access to data on transactions, sellers and buyers, including gender. They evaluated transactions from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the 420 most popular items in eBays broader categories, and on auctions because no negotiation is involved. Sellers considered to be stores were excluded.EBay did not provide financing for the study, but set conditions, according to the authors and to editors at Science Advances. The researchers contract allowed eBay to approve any study before publication, mostly for potential disclosure of proprietary data and trade secrets; the authors said eBay ended up approving the study without asking us to drop any of our results.EBay declined to discuss the specifics of the study with a reporter. In a statement, the company did not challenge the results. This study, which was based on data from more than four years ago, was not conducted or commissioned by eBay, the statement said, adding, We are passionate about harnessing our platform to empower millions of people by leveling the playing field for them. We do not reveal the gender of our sellers, although they can choose to do that themselves.Because the study computed averages, the experience of individual sellers might not match the trend, experts said. Indeed, when The New York Times, in reporting about the study, asked on Facebook if women eBay sellers felt that gender helped or hurt their sales, many people who posted responses said they felt gender was a nonissue on eBay.Price, shipping, description  thats what eBay buyers worry about, wrote Susan Butler Carpenter, a former banker who is now a stay-at-home mother in Pennsylvania and an eBay seller for 16 years. Anyone who says their gender as a woman has hurt or helped their sales is full of it. Why look for an issue where there is none?A few female sellers said they believed some buyers reacted differently because they were women.Melanie Fodera, 21, a senior at Albion College in Michigan and a seller for about seven years, said when selling a Detroit Lions jersey for $100 or best offer, she was offered $50.I countered $75, and their message to me was, You dont know what this is worth because youre a girl,  said Ms. Fodera, who usually sells womens clothes and has an eBay page decorated with roses.Another Facebook commenter, Justina Gilliam, posted: It all depends on what Im selling, really. I dont sell often, but Ive gotten men who think they can take advantage when I list sports tickets/memorabilia and women who get upset if I cant answer intricate details about a Lladr that was given to me but Im getting rid of because I dont care for it.In the 631,516 auctions the authors analyzed, women were about 23 percent of sellers. They received, on average, 0.88 fewer bids for the same items, the authors said. New items, where researchers found the largest gender gap, accounted for 78,350 sales. The biggest advantage for male sellers occurred in categories like new video games (the gap was especially huge for Nintendo Wii).The authors analyzed the text sellers used, finding that women used slightly more positive language, saying works great more often than never used, for example, Dr. Regev said. But wording differences did not account for the price gap.Cecilia Ridgeway, a gender issues expert at Stanford, said when reading the study, I did not think, Oh, eBay needs to fix this. I dont think this is a key thing weve got to do for gender equality.Still, she said she viewed the study as an indicator of the importance of gender as a way of making sense of any human being. That doesnt mean people endorse these beliefs; they just know them."}

(Sunday Review, Feb. 14):Isabel Wilkerson writes that what befell Emmett Till and Tamir Rice reflects how racial interactions have mutated over time, from the overt hatreds now shunned by most Americans to the unspoken, unconscious biases that are no less lethal and may be harder to fight. Indeed.Why is our society defensive to the point of denying that racism is still a problem? What will it take for everyone in denial to stop, pause, lose the fear and question the reactions and responses that keep us from seeing the reality?Why is the resistance so great, the hatred so strong or the cover-up and denial so powerful that blind spots are not challenged?These inquiries are the responsibility of every American to address. We need the courage to look deep, ask the questions and go beyond the tendency to explain it away.I have worked with many people who truly want to create change and are willing to have meaningful communication, even when it is uncomfortable. And if we dont want to understand or think that we already do, we have to be willing to ask ourselves, Why? How can we individually address racism or any ism that stops or slows down true equality?ROSALIE CHAMBERLAINDenverThe writer, a consultant in diversity and inclusion, is the author of the forthcoming book, Conscious Leadership in the Workplace: A Guidebook to Making a Difference One Person at a Time."}
{"text": "CHARLESTON, S.C.  TED CRUZ described Marco Rubio last week as Donald Trump with a smile, saying that both are quick to call their critics liars, though Rubio does it amiably.Cruz is right about Rubios affect, wrong about which candidate it distinguishes him from. He and Rubio are the pair twinned in so many respects beyond the curve of their lips.That makes these two United States senators  both in their first terms, both Cuban-American, both lawyers, just five months apart in age  a uniquely fascinating study in how much the style of a persons politics drives perceptions of who he is and in how thoroughly optics eclipse substance.Rubio, 44, is routinely branded mainstream and occasionally labeled moderate. Theres a belief among Republican leaders, along with evidence in polls, that he has an appeal to less conservative voters that Cruz doesnt.But thats not a function of his record or his positions on a range of issues. Like Cruz, who is 45, he found early favor with the Tea Party, which helped propel him to Washington. Like Cruz, he staunchly opposes new gun safety measures, abortion rights and Obamacare.Like Cruz, he has called for sweeping tax cuts, the abolition of the federal Department of Education, the relaxing of environmental regulations and unwavering friendship with Israel. Like Cruz, he has cast Antonin Scalia not just as a distinguished jurist but as a black-robed deity.And on the campaign trail here in South Carolina over the days leading up to its primary, he echoed Cruz in his repeated invocations of God. Rubio rolled holier and holier, competing fiercely for the votes of evangelical Christians, an important share of the Republican electorate in this state and throughout the South.He emphasized his objection to the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He worked religion into his remarks constantly  and creatively. At a town hall in Greenville that was televised by CNN, he told Anderson Cooper that his many blessings included a godly and wonderful wife.But that same event was an even better example of how Rubio and Cruz diverge  and why two conservative politicians who are conjoined ideologically so often come across like distant cousins.They took the stage one right after the other, Rubio followed by Cruz, and it was night and day. Or, rather, day and night. With a sunny voice, Rubio presented himself as an instrument of hope. With a gloomy one, Cruz played the vessel of dread. Rubios smiles were frequent and expansive. Cruzs were rarer and clenched.The two of them emerged more clearly than ever as the Kennedy and Nixon of the Republican race, one counting on charisma, the other on voters fears that all that stands between them and ruin is a warrior whose stridency proves his mettle.Rubio, granted, had more immediate cause for mirth: Hed just won the formal backing of Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina. But the way he discussed that perfectly illustrated his campaigns timbre and emotional underpinnings.Cooper asked him whether he himself had ever felt the sting of racism, and his answer was about how good America can be, not how bad.He encouraged Cooper and the audience to look at how far weve come as a country since the 1960s and mentioned not just Haley but also Tim Scott, one of South Carolinas two United States senators, who is black.I got the endorsement of a governor of Indian descent, who endorsed a presidential candidate of Cuban descent and tomorrow will be campaigning alongside an African-American Republican senator, Rubio said. All three are doing that here in South Carolina.On the subject of tensions between police officers and African-Americans, he began with a tribute to the integrity of most men and women in blue. But he pivoted quickly to the observation that black men are singled out for suspicion, and said that whether Americans accept that or not, If a significant percentage of the American family believes that they are being treated differently than everyone else, we have a problem.Im going to be a president for all Americans, because an American president has to love the American people, even those that dont love you back, he said.SUCH moments were missing from Cruzs performance. They usually are. And it showed in the audiences response. When Rubio joked about his fondness for electronic dance music, he got laughs. When Cruz broke into silly song to demonstrate how he serenades his wife on the phone, there was squirm-inducing silence.A typical Cruz campaign event is likely to include talk of the abyss on which America teeters and what a terrifying juncture this is.I wake up scared every day, Cruz said at a rally in Charleston early Friday afternoon.David Limbaugh, Rushs brother, walked onstage to stand beside him and proclaim: Were on the brink of collapse. We have maybe one last chance to save America.Phil Robertson, the prodigally bearded Duck Dynasty commander, appeared, too. Guns and Bibles and the one who wrote it brought us here! he thundered. The audience roared, especially when it was suggested that Robertson might make a great vice president for Cruz.Cruzs methods can be ruthless, as Ben Carson learned in Iowa and as Rubio was reminded in South Carolina, where the Cruz campaign promoted images of Rubio not just shaking hands with Obama but merging with him, their two faces becoming one.Nasty guy, Trump said of Cruz during the most recent Republican debate. Even he gets some things right.Although Cruz leans harder than Rubio does on the memory of Ronald Reagan, its Rubio who has learned from Reagan  and from George W. Bush  that conservatism is best sold with uplift, at least usually.But these are unusual times  hotter, harsher. While Trump promises to make America great again, he dwells on what chumps we are now. Hes not trafficking in inspiration. Hes validating a sense of victimization.If Cruz fails to expand his support beyond the most severe Republicans  a necessity if he wants the nomination  it will be a matter of how he frames his quest: us the righteous versus them the wicked.If Rubio has better luck, it wont reflect a platform significantly to the left of Cruzs. It will be about an emphasis on joviality over jeremiads.The two are similar enough beneath the surface that which of them fares better over the coming weeks will tell us volumes about what flavor of leader many Americans crave now.A cheerleader? Thats Rubio. A scold? Cue Cruz. And if its him, it means that pessimism really has trumped optimism, and weve turned a dark corner."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   Should an autopsy have been performed on the body of Justice Antonin Scalia?When a Texas justice of the peace certified that the 79-year-old Supreme Court justice had died from natural causes, questions immediately erupted. No autopsy had been performed, and the certification had been made without even an examination of the body. The unexpected death of a divisive public figure during an acerbic presidential campaign set off conspiracy theories and demands from political commentators that a pathologist perform an autopsy before Justice Scalias burial on Saturday to prove no foul play was involved.Texas officials said they had obeyed the wishes of the Scalia family in not authorizing an autopsy after the justice was found Feb. 13 in his bed at a West Texas ranch, cold, pulseless, his hands almost folded on top of the sheets as if he were taking a nap. His doctor said he had chronic cardiovascular disease, and witnesses described a scene typical for death from heart disease.An estimated 326,000 people of all ages experience cardiac arrest out of a hospital in the United States each year, and 90 percent of them die, according to the American Heart Association.In many cases, autopsies are not performed on their bodies, because of family wishes, religious objections and other factors, including the expense of the procedure (often not covered by insurance) or the lack of available forensic pathologists to perform them. But some people argue that in the case of a prominent government official, the public has a right to know.Three forensic pathologists interviewed separately were divided in their opinions about the handling of the death of Justice Scalia. Two  Dr. Michael M. Baden, a former chief medical examiner in New York City, and Dr. Vincent J. M. Di Maio, a former chief medical examiner in San Antonio  said officials had done what is usual for many individuals who die if their doctors have attested they had potentially fatal ailments.What you have is an elderly man found dead in bed, and if he was not on the Supreme Court everyone would say, O.K., and nothing more would happen, Dr. Di Maio said. It is only who he was that makes it a big deal. You can make an argument that they should have done an autopsy, but the only reason you would do it is he is a Supreme Court judge.If you are over 60 and are found dead in bed, most medical examiners offices dont do an autopsy unless there is some obvious trauma, Dr. Di Maio said.A third, Dr. George D. Lundberg, a former editor of the American Medical Association publication JAMA, said the handling was almost unbelievable. An autopsy should be mandatory when a politically prominent person dies unexpectedly, and especially if unobserved, said Dr. Lundberg, who now works for CollabRx, a Rennova Health company.In most unexplained deaths, if a personal physician attests that the deceased had an ailment that can be lethal, a justice of the peace or medical examiner usually will release the body without sending it to a medical examiner, unless officials suspect foul play or an accident. But if a police officer or funeral director sees a bullet or knife wound or sign of injury, they will call it to the medical examiners attention, which happens, but rarely, Dr. Baden said.A family in the United States has an absolute right not to have an autopsy under these circumstances unless there is enough suspicious reason for a medical examiner to intervene, but that did not happen in the jurisdiction where Justice Scalia died, said Dr. Baden, who is also a former chief forensic pathologist for the New York State Police and now has a private forensic pathology practice.More than 90 percent of deaths in the United States are from natural causes and do not become medical examiner cases, Dr. Baden said.Most sudden deaths result from a fatal heart rhythm that develops in ventricles (the hearts lower chambers) damaged by atherosclerosis. In recent years, doctors have become increasingly convinced that many sudden deaths are not so sudden but come after warning signs or symptoms that may be overlooked in the days just before death.Justice Scalia, a tennis player, went to his doctor on the Wednesday and Thursday before his death for a shoulder injury, according to The Associated Press. Pain in a shoulder can be heart-related. The A.P. reported that Justice Scalia had an M.R.I. of his shoulder and was told that the problem was from rotator cuff damage. Because Justice Scalia was too weak to endure surgery, his doctor advised rehabilitation.A relatively small number of autopsies are performed in Texas because of a lack of forensic pathologists. We do not have enough to do the cases we should do, Dr. Di Maio said, explaining that about 500 forensic pathologists are practicing in the United States and that an estimated 1,500 are needed in the country. He said that in areas where there were no medical examiners, particularly in rural areas, certifying a death was a secondary job for a justice of the peace.Without an autopsy, there is no way to know the specific cause of Justice Scalias death. Among the possibilities are a heart attack and a stroke or pulmonary embolus. Justice Scalia recently returned from travel to Asia. One problem that sometimes occurs after long airplane flights is pulmonary embolus, a formation of a blood clot in a leg from which a piece breaks off and travels in the blood to the lungs to cause sudden death.In the absence of a full autopsy, Dr. Baden said, officials could obtain critical information even from an embalmed body by inserting a needle into the heart or a tube into the bladder to perform toxicology tests on blood and urine for evidence of toxins. Sophisticated testing could distinguish drugs and chemicals from those in embalming fluid. It is not known if officials performed such tests in Justice Scalias case.Although Justice Scalias body could have appeared relaxed and asleep without showing any external signs if he had been poisoned, a natural cause is the most plausible explanation for his death, Dr. Baden said.Officials in Washington have said little about the circumstances of Justice Scalias death. To tamp down rumors and speculation, officials at the United States Marshals Service on Friday provided the first timeline of their role in Texas. Federal marshals provide protection for justices on some of their out-of-town trips, but Justice Scalia declined it for the Texas hunting resort. Wade Drew, a spokesman for the Marshals Service, said a deputy marshal from western Texas arrived at the ranch about 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 13, after the body had been found. At least three Marshals Service employees guarded the body as it was taken to a funeral home in Texas and then returned to Washington.Our folks never indicated that anything seemed amiss or unusual, but that wasnt our role, he said. We werent there to make any determination like that, so Im not going to be drawn into that."}
{"text": "Kat Danhoff is a reporter from Chicago. The fact that she is also Native American is, as she might say, irrelevant; although she does not deny it, neither does she profess it. The effect is that she passes as someone who is not Indian. As her childhood friend Becky puts it, You went off the reservation, thats for sure.In other words, Kat is a fugitive. She also happens to be in pursuit of a fugitive, Jackie Saltino, a mobster who might have stolen $450,000 from an Indian casino. He might also be passing himself off as John Salteau, a Native American storyteller who entertains children and their parents at a library in northern Michigan, particularly with tales of the trickster Nanabozho. On seeing him for the first time, Kat thinks: He could be an Indian. He could be an Italian, or a Jew, or an Arab, or an Armenian, for all she knew. ... His true identity may have been the storys hook, but it wasnt the point. The point, she reminded herself, was the money, the theft, the crime.That is also the point of Christopher Sorrentinos elegantly constructed new novel, The Fugitives, his fourth work of fiction. On the surface, its a contained blend of literary fiction and crime thriller about Kat Danhoff, John Salteau/Saltino and another runaway or fugitive, Alexander Mulligan III, otherwise known as Sandy. He is a refugee from the literary high life of New York City, a famous white male author  theres no other way to put it  who has come to northern Michigan to hide from his past and write a novel. How well can we know someone? he thinks, the classic question of the unreliable narrator. Each of my books considered questions of identity  its formation, its instability, its highly contingent state. Likewise, The Fugitives is deeply concerned with the identities of its three major characters, each of whom hides a secret. Kats background is revealed early, but the secrets of the other two will not come out until the satisfying, bloody end.And blood is important, considering this novels interest in racial identity, particularly that of Native Americans and arguably that of the white male novelist. The first words of the novel, from Salteau, are: This is long ago in the history of Anishinabek, the name we call ourselves. You all are familiar with Ojibway, or Chippewa. But like the private name one is called within his family, Anishinabek is the name we use among ourselves. Salteaus voice, which positions his audience as non-Native American, is both elevated and undermined by Sandy, who comes to hear him for inspiration. For Sandy, writing a clear, simple description is often a tortured process whose labor is hidden from the reader. He assumes that when Salteau makes storytelling look easy, it really is easy, the stories pouring forth from a tap drawing from deep in the lizard brain. Funny, because Sandys brain is also somewhat reptilian. Sandy certainly thinks highly of himself, even as he confesses to leaving his wife and children behind after a disastrous love affair that made headline news. He also talks a lot  imagine the voice of a novelist-narrator in a Philip Roth book, minus much of the charm  but his authority is undercut by Kat. On first encountering him, she thinks he might be retarded if not for his awesomely weird monologue. He may believe himself to be a slick New York writer, but to her, he looks like a big dumb yokel.Sandys whiteness, maleness and heterosexuality are grist for the novel. He reminds the reader, and perhaps himself, of these elements of his character by his generous use of common obscenities when it comes to women. These words are the basis of his first monologue, which melts into a disquisition on the part of his lovers body that calls up the voodoo drumming of desire. Something is seriously wrong with this guy (and not necessarily his sex drive, since Kat has a fairly strong libido herself), but what it is he will not admit to himself. He disguises the black hole in his memory with humorous insights about the writers dilemma. In his case, he is hounded by an agent, an editor and a patron all eager for him to deliver the novel for which he has already been paid a substantial advance. The writer, as both Sandy and Sorrentino show, cannot escape from capitalism and its corporations, which have taken over New York publishing and saturated hearts and minds. I wasnt suffering from writers block, Sandy confesses to himself. I was suffering from oversatiety and the eagerness to experience emptiness again, so that I could refill it.That description of desire could equally apply to the gamblers at the nearby Indian casino from which Saltino might have stolen. The casino was just another of the hustles that Indian culture had been reduced to, Kat thinks. Blankets, pots, storytelling, casino gambling. It amused her that it was the last that struck so many people as being particularly profane  possibly because the real profanity is not commercialized gambling, but that Indians have been forced to turn to it as a result of suffering conquest and dispossession. The novel does not mention that uncomfortable history. Does it need to? This is Michigan, home of Hemingway, whose name and fiction are referenced by Sandy, one white guy to another. Perhaps its no coincidence that Beckys description of the casinos corruption includes the clich that what is visible is only the tip of the iceberg. Hemingways famous writing advice was to show only the tip of the iceberg. Genocide is a hell of an iceberg.If non-Indians have a hard time remembering that the mass murder of Native peoples made the American dream possible, then you can see why Kat has come to believe that a politics of identity was a trap and that what matters is the money, the theft, the crime. But what exactly is the crime in question, and how will it be revealed? Narrative inevitably plays a role, as you might expect when the fugitives of Sorrentinos title include a reporter, a novelist and an oral storyteller. The trickster god Nanabozho, meanwhile, offers a possible clue to the nature of the crime. In Salteaus telling, Nanabozho gives you what you ask for, which is the last thing you need. For Sandy, at least, that bad gift might be capitalism. He has been lathered with money and fame for his novels, which is enough to reveal all the potential for vulgarity he possesses.Sorrentino  whose second novel, Trance, was a National Book Award finalist in 2005  raises all of this in a novel deliberately crafted to look smaller than it is. Given that big novels often seem to warrant attention just for their size, it is its own kind of daring for an author to aim for the understated, the concise and the perfectly joined. Like one of Nanabozhos simple, spare tales, Sorrentinos novel might be a little deceptive because it disguises its complexity. Those tricked by Nanabozho or Sorrentino are guilty of not listening closely enough. The trickster is a cunning storyteller, as is Sorrentino. Not that hes just some smart guy who writes excellent sentences. He also delivers what any reader of a thriller would expect. Rest assured that by the end of the book guns are drawn, shots are fired and we finally hear the voice of the dead."}
{"text": "There was reason to suspect, when Billions was announced, that Showtime was offering a prestige series about Wall Street, featuring two highly respected actors, Paul Giamatti and Damian Lewis, and a co-creator credit for a New York Times editor.But thats been a false assumption from the start: Back when the show premiered six weeks ago, I compared it to this years Best Picture nominees and found it had more in common with The Revenant than The Big Short. This is not a serious polemic about the exploitation of our financial system  those abuses are merely a means to an end. This is a show about masculine savagery, and Wall Street just happens to be the arena for it. It seems blithely unconcerned about being respected or winning awards, and the gravitas of Mr. Giamatti and Mr. Lewis are deployed like blunt instruments, the rhetorical equivalent of cave men beating each other with clubs.As Billions heads into the back half of its 12-episode first season, its helpful to remind ourselves of the shows true identity and embrace the lusty, high-toned delirium that revs its dramatic engine. How else to process The Deal, the shows craziest episode to date? Though the opening scene of the series micturated on the idea of Billions as a stuffy prestige drama, it may be topped by the utter absurdity of Bobby and Wendy disrobing for a meeting in an underground spa pool. (Its been a weird couple of days indeed!) Just the mere existence of this place raises questions: Where it is? Who built it? Who has access to it? How is it maintained? But those questions are as pointless as asking for the blueprints of Dr. Evils secret lair. If youre the type of guy who can cut a $1.9 billion check as if settling the cable bill, then the construction of an exclusive basement spa suddenly seems plausible.The substance of their meeting is important. After nabbing Dollar Bill Stearn for insider trading, Chuck and the United States Attorneys office are eager to deepen their case against Bobby and Axe Capital. At the same time, Bobby has prepared his office for trench warfare, likening Stearns arrest to Pearl Harbor and promising his troops that the company will emerge from the coming war like the United States after World War II  more powerful than ever. Those who try to bring our house down will see their own houses fall, he blusters within earshot of Wendy, who happens to be a resident of both houses and would rather not be left standing in the rubble. Privately, Bobby worries about the legitimate threat to his business and reputation, and Wendy makes certain that her husband knows the potential consequences of pushing the case too hard. Its in the interests of both men to settle and claim victory in the compromise. Its just not in their nature.Which brings us back to the pool. Bobby and Wendy could have that conversation somewhere else  in their private offices, in a suite at Barclays, over body sushi  but then Billions wouldnt be Billions. Wendy knows why Chuck and Bobby are locking horns: theyre alpha dogs who sniffed each other and didnt like the smell. But thats not the full extent of it. This is all a pitched battle over possession of Wendy herself, whos committed to a marriage with one man and a business partnership with the other, but struggles to keep these two intimacies apart. When shes sitting naked next to Bobby in the pool, her expression says it all: Sigh. Men.Its worth noting that the last three episodes of Billions were directed by James Foley (Short Squeeze and tonights hour) and Neil LaBute (who handled last weeks The Good Life). As filmmakers, Mr. Foley and Mr. LaBute were responsible for two of the liveliest portraits of white-collar aggression, Glengarry Glen Ross and In the Company of Men. They have been cherry-picked to manage the tone of Billions, which seeks to replicate the Darwinian viciousness at the core of those films. There are aspects of Glengarry Glen Ross and In the Company of Men that are painfully true to life  the humbling business of dead-end cold calls or the grind of setting up shop in some Midwestern corporate outpost  but the stakes are abnormally elevated and the language unusually robust.The Deal expresses the primal nature of men as strongly as any episode since the pilot, but Billions is about the folly of men, too, and it takes the presence of women like Wendy and Lara Axelrod to expose it. Both women counsel their husbands on the wisdom of coming to terms, lest both houses fall needlessly. But when Bobby and Chuck finally come to the table, ready to make a deal, the alpha dogs within start sniffing and barking again. Bobby wants Chuck to know that a record $1.9 billion fine doesnt really hurt  not a shark bite or a bee-sting or even a horsefly, but more like a red ant that stings for a minute but doesnt ruin the picnic. Then Chuck wants Bobby to know that he intends to strip him of a family office and institute a lifetime ban. Deal over. Gloves off. Needless destruction to come.Bulls and Bears: The immolation of the deal, combined with Chucks bogus recusal from the case, stands to deepen the Whats in it for her? factor of Wendys marriage. Theres been a cycle all season of Chuck acting impulsively and insensitively in pursuing Bobby and having to walk back hurtful statements to Wendy about her boss. Youre beautiful and youre talented and Im sure youll land on your feet is a callous thing to say to anyone poised to lose a job, let alone a spouse. The perverse depths of their bond remains a tantalizing mystery. Speaking of perverse bonds, behold Dollar Bill Stearn, whose loyalty to Bobby rises to the level of a capitalist jihadis. Confident that he can coerce Stearn with the scandalous revelation that Stearn has a second family in New Jersey, Chuck instead finds that Stearn has casually unlocked his smartphone and has sent an email that will destroy his own marriage and family. Kates flirtation with Bryan is mostly put on hold for another week, but she does slip him a line in Japanese: You put a tickle in my belly. Its the only Japanese phrase she knows, but it detonates properly. For the sake of drama, Billions overestimates the extent to which everyday New Yorkers pay attention to hedge-funders. Stearns perp walk probably wouldnt be a cable news scoop, nor could an excitable young man expect a selfie with Bobby to get him mad followers on Instagram. Then again, this clash of the titans requires a public stage, so a little suspension of disbelief is reasonable."}
{"text": "One of the biggest stories of the N.B.A.s trade deadline was the decision by the Toronto Raptors to stand pat. The Raptors, who will visit the Knicks on Monday, have the second-best record in the Eastern Conference and are widely seen as the team best suited to challenge the Cleveland Cavaliers for conference superiority. Although Toronto was the subject of many rumors, it made no transactions.When pressed about his decision, Masai Ujiri, the teams general manager, suggested that the choice had been made for him.Were a good team in the East, and we want to keep plugging along and figure out the playoffs, Ujiri told reporters. If you want to make that big jump, it means that youre going to have to give up something  and one, there was no deal that really came to us in that category, and secondly, it would be tough to mortgage our future.Torontos immediate goal has to be avoiding a repeat of last seasons embarrassing collapse. After a 37-15 start, the Raptors went 12-18 after the All-Star break and backed into the playoffs. They then became the first No. 4 seed to be swept in the first round of the N.B.A. postseason since the league expanded the opening round to a best-of-seven format in 2003.After that devastating elimination at the hands of the Washington Wizards, Ujiri set about fixing a team that scored well but could not play defense and did not seem to have a team-first mentality.This season, the Raptors (35-18) may be positioned for a better stretch run because of a few moves by Ujiri and an unexpected reimagining of the teams best player, point guard Kyle Lowry.After Ujiri allowed Greivis Vasquez and Lou Williams to leave as free agents, he gave four-year deals to DeMarre Carroll, a veteran forward from the Atlanta Hawks known for smart play on both ends of the court, and Cory Joseph, a point guard steeped in the system of the San Antonio Spurs. In a move that received less notice, Ujiri brought in Bismack Biyombo, a young center who has flourished as the defensive part of a rotation with Jonas Valanciunas.Although Carroll has missed a number of games because of injury, the message seemed to have been sent that the teams direction had to change, and the biggest convert, surprisingly, has been Lowry, Torontos lone All-Star last season.Lowry was the subject of fierce criticism after last seasons collapse, having gone from averaging 18.6 points a game before the All-Star break to 15.1 points after the break. He averaged 12.3 points in the playoffs  a figure inflated by a 21-point performance in a blowout loss in Game 4 against the Wizards. In Games 1 through 3, he averaged just 9.3 points and shot 23.8 percent from the field. He was also overwhelmed on the defensive end by Washingtons backcourt.Lowry, 29, responded to the failure by remaking himself physically. After showing up to training camp in terrific shape, he has averaged a career-high 21.1 points and has played stellar defense, earning a second consecutive All-Star selection.Lowrys progress and the rosters overhaul have led to significant results on the defensive end. Torontos efficiency is not necessarily apparent at first glance, thanks to the slow pace the team prefers. But entering the weekend the Raptors had allowed 104.2 points per 100 possessions, which ranks 10th in the N.B.A., a season after allowing 107.7, which was 25th. With that improvement and an offense that has continued to play well, the Raptors are one of six teams ranked in the top 10 in the N.B.A. in efficiency on offense and defense.Still, the Raptors are not yet ready to declare themselves a true contender.I think this time around we havent let our success, winning games, any of that, get to our heads, DeMar DeRozan, the other half of the teams All-Star backcourt, told reporters when asked how the team could avoid another collapse. We still feel like we have a long way to go; this time around, it feels like we havent done anything.As the team enters the part of the season where it fell apart last season, it is hard to say if Ujiris moves will ward off a similar fate. But with Lowry and DeRozan having perhaps the best seasons of their careers, and their supporting cast appearing to have bought into a team-first approach, the Raptors may prove to be Clevelands biggest challenger.And while Toronto did not make a move at the deadline, that might be because Ujiri made the right moves during the off-season instead."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump won the South Carolina Republican primary with a strong showing among his core supporters  men, moderate conservatives, those without college degrees and older voters.He also won the votes of white evangelicals, a group that made up roughly 70 percent of Republican voters in the state and that has been the backbone of Senator Ted Cruzs support, by eight percentage points.Hillary Clinton patched together a winning coalition in the Nevada caucuses of women, older voters, African-Americans, college graduates and members of union households.Her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders, apparently won a majority of Hispanics voters in the state along with overwhelming majorities of young voters, according to polls of voters entering or leaving election sites across both states on Saturday.The two parties electorates were drawn from the ideological poles compared with past races in each state. In South Carolina, the Republican voters were overwhelmingly conservative  marking more than a 10-point increase from the last two primaries in the state. Seven in 10 Nevada Democratic caucusgoers described themselves as liberal  a 25-point jump from the last caucuses there in 2008.Mr. Trumps winning coalition included Republican primary voters who said they preferred a candidate who tells it as it is, those who described themselves as angry with the federal government and those who support a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. His supporters said that they were most worried about the economy and that they most wanted an outsider candidate who could bring about change.A striking three-quarters of primary voters supported Mr. Trumps proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States  about 10 points higher than Republican primary voters in New Hampshire.Yet the Edison Media Research exit poll in South Carolina also uncovered potential hazards for Mr. Trump. As was the case in Iowa, voters who decided whom to support in the last few days backed other candidates. Mr. Trump was also viewed as running the most unfair campaign in the state, a designation that Senator Marco Rubio had been trying to pin on Mr. Cruz in recent days.Unlike in New Hampshire and Iowa, where domestic issues were most important to voters, terrorism was the top concern of voters in South Carolina. While Mr. Trump held voters trust in handling the economy by a ratio of more than 2 to 1, he and Mr. Cruz were nearly equally viewed as the best equipped to handle an international crisis. Despite Mr. Cruzs experience as a former Supreme Court clerk to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, he and Mr. Trump were tied in voters minds as the best candidate to handle nominations to the nations highest court.Mr. Cruz was backed by the very conservative, and by those who prefer a candidate who shares their religious beliefs and their values, yet he lost among white evangelicals to Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio split the support of those who decided on a candidate in the last week.Mr. Rubio enjoyed support from the most educated voters, those who valued experience in politics and those who prioritized electability in November. He also drew support from those who would allow illegal immigrants to apply for legal status and those who opposed banning Muslims. The endorsement of Mr. Rubio earlier in the week by Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina had little effect on voters  only about one-quarter said it was important.The remaining Republican candidates, Jeb Bush, Governor John Kasich of Ohio and Ben Carson, clustered in single digits, failing to win the support of any demographic groups.On the Democratic side, the entrance poll in Nevada showed Mrs. Clintons strongest support came from her coalition of women, older voters, blacks, college graduates, political moderates, union households and those who have voted in previous caucuses. Mrs. Clintons strong showing among black voters (she was backed by three-quarters of African-Americans), bodes well as she heads to South Carolina, where blacks made up 55 percent of the 2008 Democratic primary electorate.Mrs. Clinton also won the support of caucusgoers who favored experience or the ability to win in November. She also performed best among those who preferred a continuation of President Obamas policies and those who rated the economy or health care as the most important issue facing the country.Mr. Sanders drew his support from men, Hispanics, liberals, first-time caucusgoers and young people. While his support among young voters continued to be strong in Nevada, only a little over one-third of participants in the caucuses were under the age of 45.Those who most valued honesty and trustworthiness, as well as those preferring a candidate who cares about people like them, sided with Mr. Sanders. He beat Mrs. Clinton by 2 to 1 among those who valued income inequality above all other issues."}
{"text": "Jim Davenport, an infielder who played third base for most of his career with the San Francisco Giants and battled the Yankees in the World Series in 1962, the first time the Giants had played in one since they left New York, died on Thursday in Redwood City, Calif. He was 82.The cause was heart failure, the Giants announced.Davenport was a Giant for most of five decades  as a player, a coach and a manager  beginning in 1958, the teams first season in California.A right-handed hitter who was often in the leadoff spot, he took the Giants first at-bat on the West Coast, according to The San Jose Mercury News, and played alongside stars like Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda.Davenport had 10 game-winning hits in 1969 and retired after the 1970 season with a career batting average of .258.In 1962, Davenport won a Gold Glove. The Giants lost the World Series that year even though they had a higher cumulative batting average and a lower earned run average than the Yankees in the Series, and hit more home runs, triples and doubles. The decisive seventh game ended when McCoveys line drive was caught by Bobby Richardson.I was smart enough to do the little things  hit and run, bunt and catch the ball  to make myself a decent player, Davenport told SFGiants.com.After his playing days, he continued to work for the team on and off. In 1985, he had a brief stint as the teams manager after Danny Ozark spent a year in the role. Davenport was replaced by Roger Craig after compiling a 56-88 record.James Houston Davenport was born on Aug. 17, 1933, in Siluria, Ala. He attended the University of Southern Mississippi.He also coached briefly for the San Diego Padres, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Detroit Tigers before returning to the Giants in the early 1990s.His survivors include his wife, Betty; four sons, Randy, Ken, Don and Gary; and a daughter, Cathy."}
{"text": "For Amie Victoria Robertson, embroidery is a question of obsessive detail. At her graduation show at Central Saint Martins in 2014, the designer showed giant dresses embellished with clusters of florals made from Swarovski crystals and pearls. The skirts were so huge that they had to redesign the catwalk, Robertson says, laughing. That scarred me a bit, and after that I decided to make couture-like pieces that are more casual and wearable.That collection caught the eye of an LVMH talent scout, as well as Vanessa Spence, the design director at ASOS, and by the end of the following summer Robertson had two job offers: to join Marc Jacobss design team in Paris, and to launch an eponymous collaboration with ASOS Black, the cocktail counterpart of the mass-market British e-commerce giant.She accepted both, and moved to Paris to work for Jacobs while developing her collaboration with ASOS in her (very little) spare time. (She worked on Jacobs sequin-smattered crisscross prints in the fall/winter 2015 collection and the embroidered scribble print he used for spring/summer 2016.)Last October, Robertson decided to capitalize on her experience and start her own label with the support of the London-based talent incubator Fashion East. The result is A.V. Robertson, a luxe ready-to-wear collection that debuted yesterday during London Fashion Week. (Jacobs and Katie Grand, the editor of LOVE Magazine, remain mentors; Jacobs was in the audience and Marc Jacobs Beauty sponsored the show.)It feels like ages since we saw someone like Amie in London, says Lulu Kennedy, the founder and director of Fashion East, who has been responsible for the mentorship and financial support of designers such as Jonathan Anderson, Roksanda Ilincic, Simone Rocha and Craig Green. Katie Grand texted me her name, saying that she is really quite something. I looked her up and totally agreed. Yesterday, Robertson showcased deconstructed (and then reconstructed) boys striped school blazers that cited the work of collagists Matthieu Bourel and John Stezaker with an emphasis on long, lean silhouettes and shapely separates. Robertson says the photographer Francesca Woodman was an inspiration for the collection, as well as gender-fluid icons like Marlene Dietrich, David Bowie and Mick Jagger. Whats new is that theres sweaters, dresses, trousers  its a lot more wearable and tighter than my graduate collection, she says.Having only worn her own designs once, Robertson is fairly removed from her own aesthetic. Is there an A.V. Robertson woman that the designer has in mind? That whole thing bugs me because I dont think I want to label my customer as one person, she says. Its much more interesting to see a variety of people wearing your designs, styling it in their own way. I hate it when people ask that question  I dont think theres only one type of woman thats going to buy my designs!"}
{"text": "I am in a profession where I often go to peoples houses to work with their children. I have one client whom I like very much and who has requested my services a number of times, but whenever I leave that clients house, I find myself troubled. This family has a teacup pig, which lives with them in a medium-size apartment. I consider myself an animal lover, and it so happens that I have looked into the fad of teacup pigs. I know that they are really piglets of a larger variety, the potbellied pig, which are unintentionally underfed by owners who have been led by dishonest sellers to believe that the pigs need to eat less than they really do. Right now the pig is small, perhaps 10 to 15 pounds, but I know it will keep growing and that the lowest healthy weight for a full-grown teacup pig is about 60 pounds; a potbellied pig can easily grow to more than 100 pounds. I asked the family how big the pig would get, thinking perhaps they knew the facts and had some plan. They told me that they expect it to remain the size it is now. The worst part? They often remark that the pig is acting hungry; I imagine they feed him the too-small amount they were directed to by the seller. I believe that this family loves their pig very much and that I am witnessing an unintentional act of animal cruelty, but I am in a quandary: Should I tell them that they are unwittingly mistreating their beloved pet? I worry that I would be overstepping my professional bounds. People can be very touchy when it comes to their pets, and I want to maintain cordial relations with them for the sake of my continued employment. Do I have an ethical obligation to tell them the truth about teacup pigs? Name WithheldIf youre right, this pig is suffering from hunger and malnourishment, and its owners dont know. Because animals cant speak, its especially important that we speak for them. These owners, in your view, dont mean to harm their pet. So in theory, they ought to be grateful to you for bringing the facts to their attention. In reality, as you fear, they might be chagrined and reluctant to see you again. Much comes down to diplomacy. You can say that coming to know their pet led you to explore what you had heard about the breed ... and then tell them what youve found out. When it comes to the treatment of animals, Jeremy Bentham captured the essentials more than two centuries ago: The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?For a research project on a famous ancestor of mine whose father is unknown, Ive genetically tested (with their full permission) a number of male descendants. (Im female, so my own DNA wont give me the information about the male line.) One of these relatives is an elderly man who is very proud of this ancestor. But the results showed that the man he thinks is his biological father is not. I havent shared this news with him because I think it might hurt him terribly, but I dont know him well enough to know that for sure. He also has children who might want to know their actual genetic line. I truly dont know the right thing to do. Name WithheldThis issue is going to come up more and more often. Genetic testing makes it increasingly clear that fatherhood involves more faith than motherhood. Studies have come up with figures ranging from 2 percent to 30 percent for rates of nonpaternity, though the most likely figure for the contemporary United States is at the very low end of that range.The combination of expanded genetic testing with a growing interest in genealogy means that people will have to decide whether they care about their biological ancestry or their social ancestry. The hardest cases will involve men learning that their children arent biologically theirs, and children learning the same about their fathers.If there were a standard form that you and your relative filled out together, you could rely on that previous agreement as you proceed. But there isnt. So youll have to do your best to take into account a variety of considerations.To start with, the revelation could be painful to your relative. Not only would he have to think differently about his connection to his familys famous forebear; he might feel the shame of illegitimacy. Although that stigma has (thankfully) mostly disappeared, he comes from a generation for which it was a more serious matter.Some might invoke the privacy rights of the mother or the husband. But I wouldnt give either much weight: Presumably your relatives parents are long dead. What about the medical case for disclosure? Unless theres something in the data that suggests biological risks that he and his children wouldnt have anticipated (and that they could usefully act on), I doubt that knowing about his mothers infidelity will be of much use. Still, as you say, his children may want to know what you found.Finally, you have to ask yourself what truths about your parents or grandparents relationships are important enough that you would want to know them even if they were painful. Would you resent it if someone had such information about you and withheld it? If you think you would, this can be your compass here, however difficult the resulting conversation. A general moral, though: Talk before you test.I live in a suburb of Minneapolis and have shared a driveway with our neighbors for 10 years. Some days, I come home from work for lunch, and my neighbors son (who is in high school) is also home. He is sometimes with a girl and sometimes with friends. I frequently smell illegal drugs being smoked. Should I let his parents know what Ive observed? Or should I keep my nose out of their business? Name WithheldYou mention the length but not the depth of your relationship with your neighbors, so Ill assume youre not close. But as with our DNA tester, it will help to ask yourself what you would want the other party to do if your situations were reversed. You neednt agree with the laws against marijuana (thats what were talking about, right?) to think that a young person who smokes in the driveway is laying himself open to trouble. In Minnesota, possession of more than one and a half ounces is theoretically punishable by up to five years in prison. And there are other reasons to worry about a high-school kid getting blitzed in the middle of the day. Consider how you would feel  how you would be entitled to feel  if your neighbor failed to pass on similar observations about your own children. Id be guided by that."}

{"text": "What is it about a dazzling view that elevates a meal? Many of us have experienced how even humble fare, when paired with a knockout beachfront or mountaintop vista, can seem lavish.It is a phenomenon that is top of mind at Shell & Bones, a waterfront restaurant that opened in July adjacent to Pequonnock Yacht Club in New Havens City Point. Its views  easily the best in the city  transform what is already a lovely dining experience into something great.The sweeping 4,000-square-foot space, with wraparound floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over the citys harbor, Lighthouse Point Park and a glittering swath of Long Island Sound, resembles nothing so much as the deck of a docked luxury cruise liner. (In summer, the glass panels retract so that the entire room is open to the salt air.) Though the building has housed several restaurants over the past 30 years, this sleek, nautical, wood-and-tile iteration is the first to truly capitalize on the special location.The three owners  Daniel Kay, Marc Knight and Robert Bolduc  all of whom grew up in New Haven, have childhood memories of dining here back in the 1970s, when the space had a much fustier, special-occasion eatery called the Chart House. Longtime friends, the three had talked for years about opening a restaurant together. (Mr. Knight and Mr. Bolduc already own another downtown spot, Geronimo Tequila Bar and Southwest Grill.)We all felt such a connection with the place, Mr. Kay said after my visits. So when it became available last year it was like  pardon the pun  the perfect storm. We knew if we transformed the space, we could make it iconic.While it is too early to assess that prediction, Shell & Bones is already hugely popular. Warm-weather months are the busiest here, but even on a recent, frigid Saturday night the parking lot was crowded and there was a two-hour wait for a table.And people are actually waiting two hours! exclaimed the front-desk hostess, as we wove through a crowd of well-dressed patrons clustered around the central, horseshoe-shaped bar.My companions and I were seated that evening in the most packed part of the dining room  one of three high booths right next to the bar, where the hubbub made it hard to hear one another. (On our next visit, for a much more tranquil weekday lunch, we specifically requested a spot between the windows and the roaring gas fireplace.) But once our genial server had recited an arm-length list of the nights specials, and our dishes started to arrive, we settled in contentedly.Just about all the starters we tried during both meals were terrific  especially a plate of classic oysters Rockefeller, rich with creamed spinach, bread crumbs and Parmesan; a cast-iron pot of Prince Edward Island mussels (big enough to split, or to have as a main course) prepared Mediterranean style, with San Marzano tomatoes, white wine, and red-pepper flakes; a citrusy ceviche of scallops and plump Gulf shrimp, made slightly smoky by a hint of chipotle pepper; and three serrano ham croquettes, lightly crisp but oozing with manchego cheese.Our entrees were a little more hit-or-miss, but good nevertheless. Our favorite seafood dish by far was a bright, zesty plate of linguine fra diavolo, which could be ordered with shrimp or lobster (my husband, an immoderate sort, asked for both). We also loved a perfectly tender dish of steak frites, made with what the chef, Arturo Franco-Camacho, called a Boston steak  the cut below the skirt  and nicely truffle-dusted fries.A few other main choices we tried were a little less balanced. The delicate flavor of scallops served  la plancha, for example, was overwhelmed by a heavily curried cauliflower pure. Similarly, in a special featuring pan-roasted grouper, the fish seemed a bit lost amid a bold hash of chorizo, mayocoba beans, tomatoes, and black trumpet mushrooms. And the restaurants signature surf-and-turf dish  barbecued Gulf shrimp served alongside Thai-braised short ribs  was uneven: Though the shrimp were excellent, the beef lacked the piquant zing we had expected from its preparation (which used ginger, Kaffir lime and galangal).Any minor disappointment we felt, however, was immediately soothed by a shared dessert of sublimely sweet, milky tres leches cake (the best rendition I have yet tasted). As we jostled for spoonfuls of it, we discussed the obvious merits of Mr. Franco-Camacho, who has built quite a local following after nearly two decades at the helm of various Connecticut restaurants (among them the much loved, now closed Roomba and Bespoke). Before that, however, he worked in a kitchen strikingly similar to the one he occupies now: aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2.I look out the windows when Im cooking, and I feel like Im back on the ship, Mr. Franco-Camacho said in an interview after my visits. Only now Im in home port."}
{"text": "Mainstream Republicans grappled on Sunday with Donald J. Trumps sweeping victory in South Carolina as if cycling through stages of grief, with some refusing to accept that he could be the partys eventual nominee and others searching for ways to prevent his insurgent candidacy from becoming unstoppable.As his rivals headed west ahead of Tuesdays Nevada caucuses and Super Tuesday a week later, there was pressure on some of the partys most prominent figures to declare their support for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida  who finished second in South Carolina on Saturday  or at least to help rally people behind him as the most viable alternative to Mr. Trump.Both Mr. Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who finished third by a narrow margin, tried to make the case that the nominating fight was still at an early stage.Last night was truly the beginning of the real Republican primary, Mr. Rubio said on CNN.Mr. Cruz continued to remind people that he had handed Mr. Trump his only defeat so far, in Iowa.If you want to beat Donald Trump, youve got to go with the only campaign that has demonstrated that they can beat Donald Trump, he said on ABC News.Mr. Trump, who owns a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, is widely seen as a favorite in the Nevada caucuses. From there, the race heads toward Super Tuesday on March 1, when 595 delegates will be at stake in a patchwork of 11 states, where Mr. Trumps large rallies and ability to command free television time will help him.A candidate needs 1,237 delegates for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump, who won South Carolina by 10 percentage points, has more than 65 delegates; no other candidate has more than a dozen.A pair of potential endorsements loom large in Mr. Rubios hopes for vaulting ahead of Mr. Trump, who many Republicans believe could not only cost them the race for the White House but also hurt the partys chances of keeping its majority in the Senate. The critical endorsements for Mr. Rubio are those of Mitt Romney, the 2012 presidential nominee, and Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, who withdrew from the race on Saturday after finishing a distant fourth in South Carolina.Mr. Rubios allies, who have been pushing for Mr. Romneys endorsement, believe that his eventual backing is all but certain. Some thought the endorsement was imminent on Saturday.But Mr. Romney, who strongly considered a 2016 presidential campaign of his own before bowing out as Mr. Bush made a show of fund-raising force, is not ready to make an endorsement, according to three people close to him,His advisers are also said to be split as to whether he should do so. But Mr. Romney has been incensed by the campaign that Mr. Trump has run, according to those close to him, though he has only occasionally spoken out publicly, as he did after Mr. Trump praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Important distinction: thug Putin kills journalists and opponents, Mr. Romney wrote on Twitter. Our presidents kill terrorists and enemy combatants.Mr. Bushs backing will most likely be tougher to secure. He and Mr. Rubio clashed heatedly over the last few weeks of the campaign, and Mr. Bush was plainly wounded by the experience of being upstaged by a candidate who was once his protg.In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Rubio praised Mr. Bush as a visionary governor and a good man. But it may take a more concerted effort at fence-mending to persuade Mr. Bush to join forces with Mr. Rubio.Another obstacle for Mr. Rubio is the presence of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. The two are fighting for some of the same voters, and Mr. Rubios campaign openly pushed for Mr. Kasich to leave the race in a memo sent to reporters on Sunday.John Kasich has no path to the nomination, Mr. Rubios advisers wrote, asserting that there was no way for Mr. Kasich to accrue the needed delegates.Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, responded in kind. Rubio has consistently underperformed throughout this nominating process. He has the same number of second-place finishes as Governor Kasich despite spending at least $45 million more, Mr. Schrimpf said. His candidacy has not lived up to its promise despite all the hype. Rubio cant beat Trump in Florida, while we will beat him in Ohio.Mr. Kasich, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio each sought to recruit Mr. Bushs campaign donors. But some of Mr. Bushs financial supporters were not receptive to the idea of opening their wallets for another campaign.Republicans aware of the conversations taking place among many of the partys biggest financiers on Sunday described a wariness from many Bush supporters who felt burned by having given so much to a losing cause. Mica Mosbacher, a Cruz fund-raiser based in Houston and New York, said she had begun placing calls to friends who liked Cruz but stuck with Jeb out of family loyalty. She had resisted calling members of Mr. Bushs steering committee, she said, because they need a moment of silence.There was little evidence of either a partywide distress call or donors moving off the bench en masse toward Mr. Rubio, who has positioned himself to be the most palatable and electable remaining option for the Republican elites.Fred Zeidman, a major Republican donor and longtime Bush family friend who backed Mr. Bush, said he planned to take a breath and see how things played out.The same was true for Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team, who was Mr. Bushs national finance chairman. An aide to Mr. Johnson pointed out that he had invested a lot of time in helping Mr. Bush, even knocking on doors in early-voting states, and that he was not ready to shift allegiances so soon.Mr. Johnson, long a friend of Mr. Trumps, has nonetheless found himself used as an object lesson over the last week by the Republican front-runner, who mentioned Mr. Johnson at rallies as an example of special-interest donors who supported candidates like Mr. Bush.In a sign of how gingerly Mr. Trumps opponents continue to treat him, Mr. Rubio declined to attack him aggressively on Sunday. Asked about taking a more forceful approach, Mr. Rubio would say only that Mr. Trumps lack of foreign policy knowledge was worrisome.Time is running short for Mr. Rubio to demonstrate that he can achieve a victory and thwart Mr. Trump: His home state of Florida will vote on March 15.Mr. Trump was magnanimous in a round of television interviews Sunday. He argued that he was best suited to draw support from Democrats and independents in a general election against Hillary Clinton. And he went easy on his Republican opponents, even offering kind words about Mr. Bush, whom he had attacked viciously before.I wish him well  hes a nice person, he fought really hard, Mr. Trump said on MSNBC, adding that his son Eric was friendly with one of Mr. Bushs sons.As soon as the polls closed in South Carolina on Saturday night, Mr. Rubios supporters began firing off emails to Mr. Bushs backers, many of whom the Rubio supporters had remained in close contact with over the last few months in anticipation of Mr. Bushs campaign ending.Some of Mr. Rubios associates circulated data from recent polls showing that he would defeat Mr. Trump if the Republican contest narrowed to a two-man race.Well see how it plays out, Mr. Rubio said Sunday as he was boarding a flight to Tennessee, which holds its primary as part of the Super Tuesday slate and is a place where Mr. Rubio hopes to pick up crucial delegates. We feel like a lot of people that were on Jebs team are people were going to welcome onto our team, people weve known for a long time.But as the candidates projected confidence, members of the Republican establishment were filled with increasing anxiety about Mr. Trumps prospects.Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi, sounded a note of alarm about Republicans continuing to wait to see how the race develops.After Trump has won in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Republicans are crazy and about to blow the White House if we dont rally to stop him, Mr. Barbour said. Its certainly time that we have to consolidate the race.He predicted that Mr. Trumps nomination would mean a loss in the presidential race and a threat to the partys hold on the Senate.Some political strategists argued that too little had been done to take on Mr. Trump directly. Stuart Stevens, the top strategist to Mr. Romney in 2012, took issue with complaints that anti-Trump ads had failed to derail him. He pointed out that when Mr. Romney faced a challenge from Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, it was a focused effort.No one is running a modern, focused, coordinated campaign against the front-runner as if they want to win, Mr. Stevens said."}
{"text": "LONDON  Prime Minister David Cameron faced another jarring reminder of the countrys deep divisions over whether Britain should stay in the European Union on Sunday when Mayor Boris Johnson of London, a fellow Conservative and one of the partys most popular figures, announced that he would join the forces campaigning to exit the bloc.Mr. Johnsons defection highlighted the scale of the challenge Mr. Cameron faces in overcoming his countrys entrenched ambivalence about its ties to the Continent before Britons vote in or out in a referendum set for June 23.Mr. Cameron returned to London from Brussels this weekend with a deal he says protects Britains special status within the European Union and provides some disincentives for immigration from other European countries, the most recent flash point in the long-strained relationship with the 28-member bloc. But his deal is a far cry from the proper, full-on change in Britains relationship with the European Union that he promised only last year.Mr. Cameron has called this vote the most important in Britons lifetimes. But as is always the case with referendums, voters can make their choice on grounds well removed from the arguments of the elites. In this case, the outcome could hinge much less on Mr. Camerons deal than on how voters feel about any number of things: the European Union, British nationalism, immigration, the migrant crisis, nostalgia, racism, sovereignty or simply anger at the Conservative Party.Britain has always liked to see itself as semidetached from Europe, but that means that it is also semi-attached. And at the moment, four months out, opinion polls have Britons roughly divided.No matter how the vote comes out, British ambivalence will not go away. By its geography, Britain, an island, is just far enough away from continental Europe to accentuate its differences, but too close to escape the pull of history, economics and trade.As a Conservative prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, said in 1923, arguing against isolationism, Whether we like it or not, we are indissolubly bound to Europe.Those who want to leave  like Chris Grayling, a Conservative cabinet minister and leader of the House of Commons, and Justice Minister Michael Gove  argue that Britain can restore true sovereignty and control over its borders, trade relationships and immigration policies only by quitting a dysfunctional, divided and undemocratic European Union.Mr. Johnsons decision to join the out camp is another blow to Mr. Cameron and gives the campaign more spice, given that the outcome could decide the future leadership of the Conservatives.It would be hard for Mr. Cameron to hold on to his job if the referendum does not go his way, an outcome that could also endanger the ambitions of his No. 2, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, to succeed him. By the same token, Mr. Johnsons political fate could be determined by whether he has chosen the winning side in the battle.Mr. Cameron argues that a British exit, or Brexit, would only provide an illusion of sovereignty that Britain is dependent on its neighbors and that in a dangerous, globalized world, we will be safer, we will be stronger, we will be better off inside the E.U.Britains island and imperial history, say critics of the campaign to leave the union, has left proponents of an exit with an inflated view of Britains importance in the world and ability to go it alone. In reality, the in forces say, Britain is a medium-size country struggling to pay for effective armed forces and to renew its nuclear deterrent in an increasingly messy world.Its hard for us to accept that Europe is our first circle of influence, Robin Niblett, the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a London-based research institution, said in an interview. We think of ourselves as a sovereign nation because we survived the first and second world wars, while others in Europe know that sovereignty is relative.There is wishful thinking and nostalgia in the notion that leaving the European Union would restore full British sovereignty, Mr. Cameron said on Sunday in a BBC interview.Leaving would not give Britain real control, because it could no longer influence European Union rules on business, trade, security and health that affect British businesses and life.Outside, you might feel more sovereign, but youre less in charge of your own destiny, Mr. Cameron said. You have an illusion of sovereignty, but you dont have power, you dont have control, you cant get things done.Mr. Niblett said, Even if Britain leaves, the E.U. would still exist, would still be our main neighbor, and we would still need to deal with it, but from a weaker position.The argument so far has largely been political and parochial. But Mr. Cameron and his allies are beginning to make the case that Britain should remain inside the bloc for reasons of national security, too.In a world where you have got Putin to the east and ISIL-Daesh to the south, how do you stay strong? Mr. Cameron told the BBC, referring to the Islamic State. By sticking with your neighboring countries, your partners and your friends.Tim Oliver, a fellow at LSE Ideas, a foreign policy research institute at the London School of Economics, wrote in a recent study: The withdrawal of one of the E.U.s largest member states would almost certainly be a defining moment in the history of the E.U. with wider knock-on effects for NATO, European security and international relations. This presents a problem for all concerned.Even the special relationship with the United States is more cultural and linguistic than based on equality of influence. And President Obama has explicitly said the United States would prefer Britain to remain inside the European Union  not only because it makes the European Union stronger diplomatically, economically and politically, but also because it gives Washington a stronger allied voice in vital European decision-making on trade and security.In the end, most Britons are expected to cast their votes based on economics and anxiety about the uncertainty about what a departure from the bloc would bring, much as the referendum on independence for Scotland went in 2014. Scotland ended up choosing to remain in the United Kingdom.More than 45 percent of British exports in goods go to the European Union, while less than 17 percent of E.U. exports go to Britain. Even a minor disruption in Britains free-trade arrangement with the European Union would be costly, and if Britain votes to leave, Brussels will exact a price, in what could be a long and difficult negotiation, for the maintenance of a free-trade deal.Mr. Cameron is also hobbled by his previous criticism of the European Union over Greek debt, the euro, the migrant crisis, employment law and much else. Yet he now praises the very institutions he failed to transform.It may be Mr. Camerons political opponents who save him. The Labour Party has come out strongly in favor of Britains remaining in the European Union, despite the doubts of its new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who voted against Britain staying in 1975. And the Scottish National Party and its popular leader, Nicola Sturgeon, are fiercely pro-European  so much so that she threatens to demand another referendum on Scottish independence should Britain vote to leave the European Union.The Labour Party, the Scottish Nationalists and the left in general share the belief that the European Union, whatever its faults, is a counterbalance to the United States in world affairs and has taken sharply different views from Washington on issues like data privacy, corporate taxation and the Middle East."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump said Monday that he would release his tax returns at some point, probably, after the radio host Hugh Hewitt pressed Mr. Trump about when he would make them available, warning that delaying in doing so had damaged Mitt Romneys campaign in 2012.When do we get tax returns, Donald Trump, because Mitt Romney got killed on this four years ago, Mr. Hewitt said in an interview with Mr. Trump, according to a transcript provided by his aides. And youve got to get them out there as well.Well, well get them out at some point, probably,  Mr. Trump said. I mean, Im looking at it. I told my people the other day, start looking at it.His returns, he added, are among the largest. Im audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, Ive had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So its, you know, one of those things. But we are working. Theyre very complex papers, but were working on it.Mr. Hewitt pressed on, Will we get them soon, do you think?I dont know, Mr. Trump replied. I have to ask my accounting people. But well be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.Mr. Romney, who was a private equity executive before he was elected governor of Massachusetts, was savaged by a super PAC supporting President Obama, with campaign ads calling him a heartless corporate raider. Mr. Romney did not release his tax returns until the September before the general election that year, when more people were paying attention. They showed he paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. He had faced months of pressure to release the returns.On the eve of Tuesdays Republican caucuses in Nevada, where he is expected to do well, Mr. Trump also told Mr. Hewitt that he does not like the caucus system, which relies heavily on organizing and is more complex than a primary system.I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it, said Mr. Trump, who finished second to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Iowa caucuses. I really dont believe its a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, thats my preference, but lets see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.In that regard, Mr. Trump has something in common with Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have criticized the caucus system in the past for similar reasons."}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders vowed on Sunday to fight on after losing the Nevada caucuses, predicting that he would pull off a historic political upset by this summers party convention.But the often overlooked delegate count in the Democratic primary shows Mr. Sanders slipping significantly behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the nomination, and the odds of his overtaking her growing increasingly remote.Mrs. Clinton has 502 delegates to Mr. Sanderss 70; 2,383 are needed to win the nomination. These numbers include delegates won in state contests and superdelegates, who can support any candidate. She is likely to win a delegate jackpot from the overwhelmingly black and Hispanic areas in the Southern-dominated Super Tuesday primaries on March 1, when 11 states will vote and about 880 delegates will be awarded.Since delegates are awarded proportionally based on vote tallies in congressional districts and some other areas, only blowout victories yield large numbers of delegates. And Mrs. Clinton is better positioned than Mr. Sanders to win big in more delegate-rich districts, like those carved out to ensure minority Democrats in Congress, where she remains popular.She could effectively end the race in less than two weeks time on Super Tuesday, said David Wasserman, a top analyst for The Cook Political Report, who has been closely tracking the delegate race.Of course, politics is unpredictable, as this cycles presidential campaign has demonstrated. Mrs. Clinton will face questions about her candidacy, including the outcome of an F.B.I. investigation into the use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. And Mr. Sanders has shown an ability to create grass-roots excitement in surprising places.Still, while Mrs. Clinton is far from reaching 2,383 delegates, she is poised to create the sort of mathematical quandary for Mr. Sanders that she faced in 2008. That winter, Barack Obama used an 11-state winning streak to establish a lead of 100 delegates that Mrs. Clinton was never able to surmount. While a similar streak is unlikely this year, advisers to Mr. Sanders concede that Mrs. Clinton could generate a significant delegate lead now that she has momentum from her Nevada win. But they say they are not out of the running.The Clintons can get a delegate lead quicker than we can, and they have a way to gut out the delegate fight, said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. We have to turn victories in state after state into big momentum that can change the numbers.Mrs. Clinton already has a huge lead over Mr. Sanders in support from superdelegates  elected officials and party elders who each count toward the magic number of 2,383. But superdelegates could switch candidates if Mr. Sanders is the overwhelming choice of regular voters.For now, Mrs. Clinton is focused on building her lead among so-called pledged delegates  those awarded proportionally by congressional districts from primary and caucus results. Mr. Sanders is aiming to score wins in states like Massachusetts and Minnesota while holding Mrs. Clinton to narrow wins elsewhere. Small margins of victory keep delegate allocations roughly even. A New York Times analysis found that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are tied in the pledged delegate count, at 51 each.David Plouffe, the architect of Mr. Obamas delegate strategy in 2008 and Mr. Obamas campaign manager, said Mr. Sanders would need surprising landslides in surprising places if Mrs. Clinton did well on Super Tuesday. If Mrs. Clinton builds a small but stable lead, Mr. Sanders would need to overwhelm her in major primaries later in the spring.It is likely Sanders would have to win by double digits, if not by 20 points, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California to begin to crawl out of what seems like a small but, in fact, is a deep and persistent hole in the delegate count, said Mr. Plouffe, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton.Early on, the Clinton team identified the most advantageous congressional districts for winning more delegates  especially those that include large numbers of African-Americans and Hispanics. Some allies of Mrs. Clinton said a lead of 100 pledged delegates over Mr. Sanders would be enough to make it impossible for him to catch up, assuming Mrs. Clintons candidacy does not collapse. If she finishes the race in June with a lead in pledged delegates, her superdelegates are all but certain to remain loyal and clinch the nomination for her.Mr. Sanders has his own ambitious plan to rack up delegates, but it faces tougher odds than Mrs. Clintons, even though only three states have voted.The senator was counting on momentum from Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada to hobble Mrs. Clinton and energize his campaign through Super Tuesday, and then in Michigan and elsewhere in March. But he won only New Hampshire. His campaign is now spending heavily to win four of the Super Tuesday states  Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Oklahoma  while taking victory for granted in a fifth, his home state of Vermont.Mr. Devine, a veteran of presidential campaigns and a longtime expert in delegate strategy, said that if Mr. Sanders could end up close to Mrs. Clinton in the pledged delegate count, the senator and his team would lobby superdelegates from the states he won to reflect the will of their voters, defect from her and give him a margin to win the nomination.Several Sanders supporters said they were counting on the proportional system of allocating delegates to keep Mr. Sanders in the race for several more months. While many Republican primaries award delegates on a winner-take-all basis, the Democratic rules can mean a long race when there are two or more strong candidates.Now other factors come into play like her emails and transcripts, said State Senator Tick Segerblom of Nevada, a Sanders supporter, referring to controversies over Mrs. Clintons private server and the unreleased transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street firms.Some Democrats pointed to Mrs. Clintons hiring of Jeffrey Berman, a consultant to the campaign and a leading Democratic thinker on delegate strategy, as a major advantage for her. Mr. Berman worked closely with Mr. Plouffe on the Obama campaigns strategy of competing hard in every congressional district. Mrs. Clintons 2008 campaign focused instead on winning the most delegate-rich states.Hillary should have been the nominee in 2008, but Berman was an old-fashioned delegate counter who bested her campaigns approach, said Elaine C. Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studied the 2008 race for her 2015 book, Primary Politics. She is clearly not making that mistake again.Mr. Berman said Mrs. Clinton had cleared some of the key hurdles in the delegate race, starting with a narrow win in the Iowa caucuses, where she proved she could prevail in the caucus format after losing 13 of 14 caucuses to Mr. Obama in 2008. Mr. Sanders was widely expected to win more delegates than Mrs. Clinton in caucuses because they are driven by the sort of energized voters he has inspired. Instead, she came out ahead.The Clinton campaign is built for the long haul, much as the Obama campaign was in 2008, Mr. Berman said.Mr. Wasserman of The Cook Political Report said its analysis of the Nevada race bore out Mr. Bermans point.By our math, Bernie Sanders needed to win 19 of Nevadas 35 delegates to keep pace for the nomination nationally. Instead, Clinton won at least 19 delegates and possibly 20, Mr. Wasserman said. This is the first contest thats provided real reassurance that shes still the front-runner, and it robs Sanders of the one thing he had going for him recently  momentum."}
{"text": "Any doubts that Donald J. Trump has had a huge (as he might say) influence on the Republican Party were dispelled this month when Senator Rob Portman came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.There is no more respected member of whats called the Republican establishment: Senator Portman, an Ohio lawmaker, is a confidant of the Bush family, a runner-up vice-presidential pick in 2012 and a former United States trade representative.But Mr. Portman is up for re-election, and Mr. Trump has changed the dynamics of the trade debate. Mr. Portman voted last year to give President Obama fast-track negotiating authority on trade agreements, which was intended to pave the way for pushing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership through Congress. But this month he said he was opposed to the agreement.Republicans used to be the protectionist party. They wrote the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised tariffs on imports. After World War II, when the United States emerged as a global superpower, both parties essentially embraced the nations role as a leader in the worlds economic recovery.But a generation ago, Democrats, prodded by labor, began to change their stance because too many workers were being displaced by globalization. It was left to a couple of Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama, working with Republicans, to embrace and enact trade measures.In this election season, however, Mr. Trump has set the agenda, and no presidential candidate is carrying a free-trade banner. He charges that Americas political hacks and diplomats have been taken to the cleaners on trade deals that have cost millions of jobs. He vows to undo Mr. Clintons North American Free Trade Agreement, dump the proposed Pacific Rim pact and go after Mexico, Japan and China on trade. He has suggested a 35 percent tax on cars imported from Mexico. He also advocated a 45 percent tax on imports from China. (He has denied that he made that proposal, but his words were captured on tape.)Such statements horrify traditional Republicans. Hearing this demagogue talk about a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports is arrogantly insane, a clear path to the results of the old Smoot-Hawley Tariff of the 30s  which made sure the Depression lasted for a decade, said Bill Brock, a former Republican National Committee chairman and United States trade representative.To be sure, a number of economists and trade experts have dialed back their unbridled enthusiasm for trade deals. The advantages are well advertised, and largely correct, but the problems for American workers are more severe than most free-trade advocates have acknowledged. This is especially true for those in manufacturing and low-skilled, older workers, many of whom are drawn to Mr. Trump.Steven R. Weisman, a vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization with a strong free trade bent, recently published The Great Tradeoff: Confronting Moral Conflicts in the Era of Globalization, which tackles this dilemma.Mr. Weisman still supports pacts like the Trans-Pacific Partnership but says these will be achievable  politically and economically  only if we address the workers who are getting badly hurt by the intertwined forces of technology and trade. Trade deals, he argues, need to include better and more creative training programs for displaced workers, as well as other notions such as wage insurance, which enables trade-affected workers to take lower-paying jobs without losing lots of money.Yet this sort of rational, balanced discussion is absent in the presidential election, which is dominated by the Trump view. South Carolina is a good example. Once a protectionist hotbed after its old-line businesses were devastated by imports, the state is now home to the plants of huge multinational corporations such as BMW and Michelin.Still, surveys show that most South Carolinians favor a tax on imported goods to protect domestic jobs and that the states Republicans, even more than Democrats, are against the Pacific trade pact.Mr. Trump was the runaway winner of the states Republican primary on Saturday. Thats a message that will resonate in financial and trade capitals around the world."}
{"text": "When the Kentucky governor, Matt Bevin, suggested last month that students majoring in French literature should not receive state funding for their college education, he joined a growing number of elected officials who want to nudge students away from the humanities and toward more job-friendly subjects like electrical engineering.Frustrated by soaring tuition costs, crushing student loan debt and a lack of skilled workers, particularly in science and technology, more and more states have adopted the idea of rewarding public colleges and universities for churning out students educated in fields seen as important to the economy.When it comes to dividing the pot of money devoted to higher education, at least 15 states offer some type of bonus or premium for certain high-demand degrees, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.There will be more incentives to electrical engineers than French literature majors, there just will, Mr. Bevin, a Republican, said after announcing his spending plan. All the people in the world who want to study French literature can do so; theyre just not going to be subsidized by the taxpayers like engineers will be, for example.Or, as Gov. Patrick McCrory of North Carolina once put it, higher-education funding should not be based on butts in seats, but on how many of those butts can get jobs.What has incensed many educators is not so much the emphasis on work force development but the disdain for the humanities, particularly among Republicans. Several Republicans have portrayed a liberal arts education as an expendable, sometimes frivolous luxury that taxpayers should not be expected to pay for. The Republican presidential candidate Senator Marco Rubio, for example, has called for more welders and fewer philosophers. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida  criticized anthropologists, and Mr. McCrory belittled gender studies.Democrats have, for the most part, avoided denouncing the humanities, but they have argued that education and training should be better aligned with the job market.The Obama administration, for example, proposed, much to the horror of many in academia, rating the countrys 7,000 colleges and universities not only on measures like completion rates and student loan debt, but also on earnings after graduation. Dozens of states have already moved to performance-based goals that more closely tie a portion of their higher education funding to particular outcomes like degrees earned or courses completed.But the particular focus on jobs and earnings  originally limited to vocational programs and community colleges  is gaining momentum.Theres a deeper question of what public money should be used for, said Anthony Carnevale, a Georgetown University professor who runs the Center on Education and the Workforce.Education tends to be justified in terms of personal exploration and fulfillment, as well as creating informed citizens who make a functioning democracy possible. The humanities have traditionally been seen as crucial to both endeavors.The problem is that education is now the principal determinant of earnings, and we pay no attention to it at all. Thats gone too far, Mr. Carnevale said. Theres a lot of buyers regret out there.Mr. Carnevale argues that there should be much more information available to students about employment and wage prospects before they choose a major so that they can make informed choices. We dont want to take away Shakespeare. Were just talking about helping people make good decisions, he said. You cant be a lifelong learner if youre not a lifelong earner.A graduate with a higher-earning degree could make up to $4 million more in lifetime earnings than other college graduates, Mr. Carnevale said. Most of the top earners in the liberal arts end up matching only the bottom earners in science, technology, engineering and mathematics  known as the STEM fields  and some will earn less than high school graduates who have vocational skills, like welders and mechanics.A recent salary survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers, a nonprofit membership organization that connects campus career officers with business recruiters, found once again that new STEM graduates were expected to command the highest overall average salaries in 2016. New engineers, for example, are expected to earn nearly $65,000 a year.The average salary for new graduates who majored in humanities  including French literature  is projected to increase slightly from last year to $46,065, up from $45,042. Although data is more limited, these graduates seem to attract the most interest from employers in finance, insurance and real estate, the survey found. The average for social science majors is $46,585.But informing students better is one thing. Penalizing certain majors in the form of reduced funding is another.In his address to the Kentucky General Assembly, Mr. Bevin said, The net result of putting public tax dollars into education is to ensure that we actually are graduating people that can go into the work force.Not surprisingly, humanities professors were among the most vocal critics of Mr. Bevins remarks. In an op-ed article last month in The Lexington Herald-Leader, Jeffrey N. Peters, who teaches French literature at the University of Kentucky, noted that Mr. Bevin graduated from the liberal arts university Washington and Lee with a bachelors degree in Japanese and East Asian Studies after studying abroad in Japan.I would like to thank Bevin for drawing on that formative experience to remind Kentuckians during his Tuesday budget presentation that the study of world languages, literatures and cultures is a valuable pursuit that has led countless college students to successful careers in education, business, international relations, the arts and  as his own story demonstrates  public service, Mr. Peters wrote.Mr. Bevins office offered few details about precisely how the funding formula would work. But in general, the trend of reducing funding the humanities and providing added incentives for STEM majors at public institutions would mean that a liberal arts education would be increasingly limited to those who could afford to attend expensive private institutions.Other critics expressed concerns about allowing government officials to pick work force winners and losers.We are not good at predicting what jobs are going to be required in five years and 10 years down the road, said Debra Humphreys, a senior vice president at the Association of American Colleges and Universities. She worries that underfunding the humanities will not only undermine educational quality but be bad economic policy. You run a huge risk when you say you are going to divert money from this major to that major.Research by the association shows that employers are not as focused on individual majors as they are on the kind of broad-based analytic, communications and problem-solving skills that a humanities education specializes in, Ms. Humphreys said.The question of whether to reward colleges for turning out STEM graduates or for higher job placement rates has generated a lot of debate in Tennessee, where all of the states higher education funding is tied to various performance measures, said Russ Deaton, the interim executive director of Tennessees Higher Education Commission.Im not sure I trust myself to decide which degree programs or which fields deserve that premium and what that premium should be, Mr. Deaton said.A lot of the feedback we get from employers is not only about the necessity of technical skills, but the soft skills as well  the ability to think creatively, to work in groups, things that you traditionally get in the liberal arts, he said. Its not as simple as STEM is valued and worthy of incentives and everything else is not."}

Kennedy, Columbia University and Jean Kennedy Smith said that Hamilton was the winner of a rich prize named in honor of the senator, who died in 2009.Hamilton, the hit Broadway show, which uses hip-hop and other contemporary musical styles to chronicle the life and death of Alexander Hamilton, seems tailor-made for the Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History, which, as its name suggests, seeks to honor a new play or musical that enlists theaters power to explore the past of the United States.Lin-Manuel Miranda, the 36-year-old author and star of Hamilton, will receive a $100,000 award. This is the fourth year the prize has been given out; last year it went to Father Comes Home from the Wars, Parts 1, 2 & 3 by Suzan-Lori Parks; in 2014 to Detroit 67 by Dominique Morisseau, and in 2013 it was split between All the Way, by Robert Schenkkan, and The Body of an American, by Dan OBrien.This years finalists, in addition to Hamilton, included An Octoroon by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Indecent by Paula Vogel, Sweat by Lynn Nottage, and Vietgone by Qui Nguyen. The winner was determined by a jury of playwrights, musical theater writers, and scholars.The award was established by Ms. Smith, Kennedys sister.Hamilton, which opened on Broadway last August after an Off Broadway run at the Public Theater, has been an enormous commercial success  in recent weeks it has been the top grossing show, besting The Lion King and Wicked, and it has already announced plans for an open-ended run in Chicago and a national tour starting in San Francisco.It has also enjoyed significant critical acclaim and has earned a number of other awards. Mr. Miranda won the $50,000 George Washington Book Prize from the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, the Mount Vernon Ladies Association, and Washington College. He was designated a MacArthur Fellow (the so-called genius grant) which comes with a stipend of $625,000. The Off Broadway run of the musical won an Obie for best new American theater work. Just last week, the shows cast recording won a Grammy for best musical theater album.The biggest prizes are still ahead  the Pulitzer Prize in drama and the Tony Award for best new musical are to be announced in the spring  and Hamilton is widely viewed as a leading contender for those honors as well."}
{"text": "FAIRFAX, Va.  Recalling his earliest days in politics on Monday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said that he first won election to the State Legislature thanks in large part to women who left their kitchens to campaign for him.How did I get elected? I didnt have anybody for me, he said at a town-hall-style forum at George Mason University. We just got an army of people  and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and to put yard signs up for me, all the way back when, you know, things were different.Mr. Kasich was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1978, when he was 26.Now you call homes and everybodys out working, Mr. Kasich added. But at that time, early days, it was an army of the women that really helped me to get elected to the State Senate.Later, a nursing student noted his earlier comment before asking him about his support for legislation stripping funding from Planned Parenthood in Ohio, which he signed on Sunday.First off, the student said. I want to say, your comment earlier about the women came out of the kitchen to support you  Ill come to support you, but I wont be coming out of the kitchen.I gotcha, I gotcha, Mr. Kasich said.Mr. Kasichs remark immediately drew criticism, and his campaign later issued a statement addressing his remark.The Ohio Democratic Party issued a news release with the title, Kasich Gives Don Draper a Run for His Money, referring to the Mad Men character.Dawn Laguens, an official with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, called his comment flat-out insulting and said his condescending attitude toward women needs to stop.And Ilyse Hogue, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said, When I heard John Kasichs latest offensive views on women and our rights, I almost dropped the casserole I was taking out of the oven!Hillary Clintons campaign also responded to his comment, posting on Twitter: Its 2016. A womans place is  wherever she wants it to be.Asked later Monday about the Twitter post by Mrs. Clintons campaign, Mr. Kasich told reporters, I completely agreeBefore an event at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Mr. Kasich said the town-hall-style meetings he now holds on the campaign trail used to be in kitchens and living rooms, and said women have played a large role in his political career. He noted that his campaign manager, his lone appointment to Ohios Supreme Court, and his lieutenant governor are all women.Everybodys just got to relax, Mr. Kasich said, adding that he was not a scripted candidate.Im real, he said, and maybe sometimes I might say something that isnt artfully said as well as it should be, but, you know, Im kind of a real guy, and I think people want authenticity, and Im going to continue to be authentic, and every once in a while Ill have to go back and make sure people know what I really mean when I say something.Mr. Kasich, who has received less attention than some other Republican candidates, said the criticism on Monday suggested that somebodys listening out there to him.So Ill be a little bit more careful, but Ill continue to operate, you know, on a high wire without a net, he said, and frankly Id like to see everybody whos running for president get out of the scripted role and start to be real and take questions."}
{"text": "Lets get straight to it: Hoboken Squat Cobbler is not a known, categorized sexual fetish. At least that was the case, according to the Internet, the day before the airing of this episode. No doubt the Urban Dictionary will fill this void soon.For now, its safe to say that Jimmy McGill invented the term as he improvised an alibi before a pair of skeptical Albuquerque detectives. Which suggests I am wrong to think Saul Goodman has yet to show up in Better Call Saul. Because what we witnessed here was Saul at his finest  a man lying with a magnificent fluency, on behalf of a criminal.It was my favorite scene of this very young season. I particularly loved the notion that as convincing as Jimmy was, the cops apparently ended the interview less than fully persuaded that a lovers spat, and the aforementioned fetish, explained the home robbery of Daniel Wormald, the worlds most irritating naf.Youre going to have to make a video, Jimmy tells Wormald as they leave the police station.We arent treated to the conversation that followed, sadly. Instead, the next scene is Jimmy telling Kim Wexler about the entire charade as the two nibble a pie, described by Jimmy as a leftover prop. Any other show would have faded to black on this impish, triumphant note. But Kim grasps that Jimmys afternoon of adventure could jeopardize his job at Davis & Main, the firm that has just hired him.Theyre never going to find out, Jimmy says.You sound like every dumb criminal, Kim retorts.She has a point. Jimmy had been summoned to represent Wormald by Mike Ehrmantraut, who broached the subject by asking a question that hovers over much of this show: You still morally flexible? Given his flexibility, one is tempted to say that joining Davis & Main was a mistake, that Jimmy is now as out of place as a carnivore at a salad bar. But there are always shades of gray in the universe as imagined by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the shows creators. When we watch Jimmy as a legit lawyer, he is superb. His elderly clients love him, his boss, Clifford Main  a guitar-playing Ed Begley Jr.  is impressed by his insights, and he is both smart and entertaining when describing the class-action case to colleagues.For now, Jimmy has a permanent address in the realm of respectability, and is also ready for piecework in the netherworld. He is ambidextrous, morally speaking. My hunch is this season will track his efforts to live on both sides of a line that he surely cant straddle for long. Its also safe to assume that Chuck McGill will try hard to make Jimmys equipoise impossible. (Tellingly, its right after a conversation with Chuck that Jimmy agrees to take Wormalds case, and lie to the police.) When Chuck learns, early in the episode, that Jimmy has a partner-track job at Davis & Main, he can hardly control his rage. In case we missed it, we are treated to the sort of slow-burn glower usually found only among riled Iagos in productions of Othello.Im just going to say it: Ive had enough of Chuck. He slows the show. Heck, there was even a metronome on hand for his opener, which just underscored exactly how much the man drags down the pace. Plus, I prefer the Breaking Bad model, which largely stuck to one villain per season. (I know, I know: Villains like Gus Fring lasted multiple seasons. But Gus was vastly more fascinating than Chuck.) Far from disappearing, Chuck attended a meeting at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill just to discomfit Jimmy. Or as he balefully told his younger brother, To bear witness.But must we bear witness to Chucks witness-bearing? I cant foresee much fun in it.I was much more entertained by Mikes visit to A to Z Fine Upholstery, a shop where Nacho Varga has a day job working for his father. Mike has come to persuade Nacho to return Wormalds baseball cards, which Nacho stole from Wormalds home, along with some drug-deal cash. Mike is getting nowhere until he threatens to reveal to Tuco Salamanca, the homicidal alpha dog of Nachos gang, that Nacho has been cutting deals and pilfering on the side.That does the trick. All thats left is an exchange  Nacho hands over the baseball cards, Wormald hands over that preposterous Hummer, which is headed to the chop shop.Looks like a school bus for 6-year-old pimps, Nacho sniffs, refusing to even drive the vehicle away. (Well put, sir.)A to Z Fine Upholstery is a legit business, run by a scrupulous man. (And dont try to upsell him, O.K.? Nachos father tells his son in Spanish.) But it is just a place for Nacho to collect a paycheck as cover for the mad stacks, to use one of Jesse Pinkmans favorite terms, he earns as a thief and dealer. In this regard, the subplot brought back the Breaking Bad trope of a criminal underbelly, hiding in plain sight, something Better Call Saul could stand to do more often.Albuquerques villainous underground was sometimes literally subterranean in Breaking Bad  think of Krazy-8 bike-locked in the basement in Season 1, or Gus Frings meth lab beneath his laundry company. But the show also had a remarkable ability to mythologize utterly mundane parts of that sun-baked city, like The Sopranos did for northern New Jersey. I wanted to visit the restaurant that served as the setting for Los Pollos Hermanos because it took on a mysterious grandeur by serving as a front for Gus Fring. (Its actually just a fast food joint, once you wander in. But still  its kind of thrilling.)In moments like the police station scene and Mikes negotiation with Nacho, Better Call Saul is still better than nearly everything else on television, but it lacks the same evocative sense of a hidden, sinister Albuquerque. I cant think of a Better Call Saul setting that Id like to visit. This is perhaps because none of them are home to a devious, outsized sociopath, but it might also be that the writers arent interested in the kind of illicit thrills they crafted in Breaking Bad. (Cobbler was written by Gennifer Hutchison, a former Breaking Bad writer.) So far, Better Call Saul is a far more interior show. It raises similar questions about ethics and human nature, without the body count.Im not simply arguing for more shooting, though it wouldnt bother me to see more weapons. I just wonder if this shows general lack of urgency and visceral kicks  or anything equally compelling to take their place  might start to work against it. Is anyone dying to catch the next episode? What is that you cant wait to find out? What open questions do you yearn to have answered? Aside from What does that light switch in Jimmys offices actually turn off? Im kind of blank.Yes, a love story is emerging with Kim, and yes that love story will be complicated by Jimmys wayward inclinations. Other than that, the only real reason I look forward to Episode 3 is the shows track record. Season 1 proved Better Call Saul can flex its dramatic muscles, vigorously, at any moment. Hopefully it will. Soon.Lets hear your thoughts. And can any lawyers out there explain something? Kim is amused by the cobbler-related lies Jimmy told the cops, but shes horrified that he made a video to back them up. Its the video that incenses her, and makes her worry about Jimmys future in the bar.Why? Is it O.K. to lie to the cops, as long as you dont produce physical evidence of that lie? Is the videotape worse than the lie it was made to support?Oh, and is anyone else off pie for the time being?"}
{"text": "It was a day in New York City that no firefighter could forget: Six of the departments own, battling a blaze in a Bronx apartment building on a brutally cold Sunday in 2005, became trapped on the fourth floor, hemmed in by illegal drywall partitions and unable to find the fire escape.Two would die after jumping out of the building. Four others were severely injured, one of whom died six years later. On that same day, Jan. 23, 2005, another firefighter would die while fighting a house fire in Brooklyn.Those fires, which claimed the lives of Lt. Curtis Meyran and Firefighter John Bellew in the Bronx, and Firefighter Richard Sclafani in Brooklyn, made that day the deadliest for firefighters in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.On Monday, more than a decade after what came to be known as Black Sunday, a State Supreme Court jury in the Bronx awarded five of the firefighters who battled the Bronx blaze and their families $183 million in damages from the city and the buildings owner, a result their lawyer called long-awaited vindication. The family of the sixth firefighter had settled its case before the verdict.About $140 million will be paid by the city, which the firefighters lawyer, Vito Cannavo, had argued was at fault because it had failed to equip firefighters with the proper ropes to escape. The rest will be paid by one of the buildings former owners, 234 East 178th Street L.L.C., which settled with all six firefighters and their families before the verdict. The judge has some discretion over the final amount.During the trial, whose opening arguments were held in November, Mr. Cannavo said he had argued that not only had the city done away in 2000 with the ropes it once issued to firefighters for their safety, but it had also failed to make any effort to replace them, a choice he said had fatal consequences.A spokesman for the Fire Department said that a number of policy changes resulted from the fire, and that all firefighters are now issued ropes.A spokesman for the citys Law Department said the jury had placed too much of the blame on the city.The city has always viewed this incident as a tragedy for the firefighters and their families, but we believe that the jurys verdict does not fairly apportion liability in view of compelling evidence that established that the landlords numerous building code violations were directly responsible for this horrible event, the spokesman, Nick Paolucci, said in a statement. We will review the record and evaluate our legal options.A lawyer for 234 East 178th Street L.L.C. could not be reached for comment.A criminal trial in 2009 against 234 East 178th Street L.L.C. and another former owner of the building, which focused largely on the illegal partitions, resulted in convictions on charges of criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment. But a judge overturned the conviction a year later.That, said Mr. Cannavo, who represented five of the six firefighters, is why the verdict on Monday was such a big case for them, because they finally got some vindication and some satisfaction."}

{"text": "The two gay men were walking along Sixth Avenue when a person passing by taunted them, calling them gay wrestlers and faggots.This was the West Village, birthplace of the modern gay rights movement, and the men, Mark Carson and Danny Robinson, out for a night on the town, were not going to let the comments stand, Mr. Robinson testified in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday.They followed the person as he rounded the corner onto West Eighth Street. The man, Elliot Morales, was standing in the shadow of a shuttered bookstore, displaying a silver pistol in his right hand, Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Carson froze, he recalled. Too angry to be scared, Mr. Robinson said he kept talking to Mr. Morales even as he was dialing the police on his cellphone.I was saying, Why do you have to do this? he said. Are you going to shoot us out here in front of all these people? Put the gun down.Mr. Morales then remarked that his gun did not make much noise, Mr. Robinson recalled. He raised the weapon and fired into Mr. Carsons face, Mr. Robinson testified. Mr. Carson jerked and fell lifeless into the street, he said. He said that he never saw the wound, but he remembered the trickle of blood running down the street, growing thicker, a small crimson flood.The killing of Mr. Carson just after midnight on May 18, 2013, shocked New York City and led to angry street protests to call attention to a surge of violence against gays in the city that year. He was 32 when he died, a Brooklyn native who worked as an assistant manager at a gelato kiosk in Grand Central Terminal.On Monday, the trial of Mr. Morales, 36, who is charged with murder as a hate crime and weapons possession, began with opening statements.Mr. Morales, who is representing himself, told jurors that he was not a bigot of any type and claimed that what happened was not an act of intent or hate on my part.I am a human being like everyone else, he said. I made my share of mistakes. That doesnt make me a bad person.But a prosecutor, Shannon Lucey, said the evidence would show that Mr. Morales purposely picked an argument with Mr. Carson because he was gay, then shot him in cold blood as several people looked on. Mark Carson was a total stranger to Elliot Morales, and he was killed for no other reason than because he was gay, Ms. Lucey told the jury. No other reason.The trial has been delayed several times because Mr. Morales, who served 11 years in prison for armed robbery, rejected four court-appointed lawyers who had been assigned to him before announcing he would represent himself.There were more delays in recent months because Mr. Morales had asked the court to order that a material witness, Joseph Matos, be brought to New York City from a Florida prison. Mr. Matos was with Mr. Morales the night of the killing.The murder happened early on a Saturday morning, just after midnight. Ms. Lucey said that several people saw the shooting, including a couple out on a date, an Italian tourist and a graduate student. Mr. Morales was arrested a few minutes later on West Third Street, she said. Ordered to stop, he pulled a pistol on Officer Henry Hoyt, but fumbled the gun. The officer wrestled him to the ground. Ballistics tests confirmed it was the same gun that had been used to kill Mr. Carson, Ms. Lucey said.Ms. Lucey said Mr. Moraless anti-gay rant had started earlier in the evening, after he and two friends, Mr. Matos and Oscar Robles, had driven from Upper Manhattan down to Barrow Street in Mr. Matoss car.Mr. Robles testified on Monday that he was a superintendent at a residential building at 9 Barrow Street and needed to retrieve his phone charger. The three men had been having drinks at Mr. Robless apartment on 140th Street earlier in the evening, he said.While Mr. Robles was inside the building, Mr. Morales urinated on the front window of the Annisa restaurant on the street, and the manager came out to tell him to leave, Ms. Lucey said in her opening remarks. Enraged, Mr. Morales burst into the restaurant, yelled anti-gay slurs at a bartender and threatened his life. He yanked his gray sweatshirt up to reveal the pistol, she told the jury.But before the police arrived at the restaurant, Mr. Morales and his two friends climbed into the car and drove to a pizza place on Sixth Avenue near Eighth Street, Ms. Lucey said. There they encountered Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson, who were walking up the avenue, headed to a bar on Eighth Street. It was warm, and they were wearing shorts and tank tops. Mr. Robinson, 34, an office manager for a dermatologist, said he and Mr. Carson were lifelong friends and roommates but were never romantically involved. We did everything together, he said.As they passed by Mr. Morales, they heard him say, You all look like gay wrestlers, Mr. Robinson recalled. His friend was offended and went back to confront Mr. Morales. It was Mark doing most of the talking, Mr. Robinson said. He was like: Youre not going to do anything! Youre not going to do anything!Mr. Robinson said Mr. Morales responded by saying, Lets go around the corner and Ill show you, and began using anti-gay slurs. They decided to follow him, Mr. Carson leading the way. He was just saying Hes not going to do anything, hes not going to do anything, Mr. Robinson said."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   Senate Republicans on Monday seized on a 1992 speech by Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, in which he argued against any Supreme Court appointment during a presidential campaign, grabbing an early advantage in what is likely to be a protracted battle to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.The vice presidents remarks are unlikely to deter the White House from submitting a nominee in the coming weeks, and Republicans may still face public pressure to allow the confirmation process to go forward, especially if Mr. Obamas pick is respected and has been confirmed by the Senate to other posts.Nonetheless, Republicans appeared to take the upper hand in a fight that stands to dominate Capitol Hill for months. The outcome could tilt the ideological balance of the court and reshape American life for generations.It is my view that if a Supreme Court justice resigns tomorrow or within the next several weeks, or resigns at the end of the summer, President Bush should consider following the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not  and not  name a nominee until after the November election is completed, Mr. Biden, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued on June 24, 1992.Mr. Biden was making the same point that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has made  a position opposite to the one that he and President Obama have taken. The video upended a day when Senate Democrats had hoped to attack the Republican position as obstructionist.Mr. Biden, in a statement, said his comments in 1992 had been misinterpreted. He noted that in the same speech, he had called for the Senate and White House to overcome partisan differences.Some critics say that one excerpt of my speech is evidence that I oppose filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year, he said. This is not an accurate description of my views.Mr. Bidens remarks resurfaced as the Senate reconvened for the first time since Justice Scalias death, and as the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, gave his own floor speech criticizing Republicans for obstructionism and insisting that any nominee put forth should be given fair hearings and a swift confirmation vote.Once the president has sent a nominee to the Senate, its our responsibility to act, Mr. Reid said. Unfortunately, it appears that the Republican leader and his colleagues have no intention of filling this important vacancy.In recent years, the Republican leader and Republican senators have done everything possible to grind the will of government to a halt, he continued. But now were seeing something from the Republican leader that is far worse than his usual brand of obstruction. Were seeing an unprecedented attempt to hold hostage an entire branch of government.Mr. Reid apparently did not see Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sitting behind him, waiting to take the floor. Earlier, Mr. Grassleys staff had released the draft of a floor speech that offered only praise for Justice Scalia and his defense of individual liberties. That text was largely replaced by a focus on Mr. Biden.The presidential election year was 1992, Mr. Grassley said. We had no Supreme Court vacancy. No justice had passed away unexpectedly. No justice had announced his or her intention to retire. Rather it was the fear of an unexpected resignation that drove this former chairman.These are the Biden rules, Mr. Grassley said. The Biden Rules recognize that under these circumstances, quote, The president should consider following the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not name a nominee until after the November election is completed.Moments earlier, Mr. Reid had accused Republicans of distorting the truth by suggesting that it was improper for a president to nominate a Supreme Court justice in his final year in office.Senate Republicans would have the American people believe that it is a long-held practice to deny the president the right to fill a Supreme Court vacancy  this is simply not true, Mr. Reid said. It grieves me to say it, but when Republicans repeat this statement theyre clearly spreading a falsehood.But in a sign of the confounding nature of the politics surrounding the court, even as Republicans seemed to gain ground, they suffered a first defection on Monday as Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, broke with his party in an op-ed in The Chicago Sun-Times that said he was willing to consider any nominee submitted by Mr. Obama.Aides to Mr. Reid noted that Mr. Biden, in the 1992 speech, expressed a willingness to cooperate with President George Bush.Therefore, I stand by my position, Mr. Biden said. If the president consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.Mr. McConnell initially took a different approach on Monday. He opened his remarks by calling for a moment of silence in memory of Justice Scalia, and he gave a speech focused on praising the justice, who died Feb. 13, calling him one of a kind. Later in the day, however, he said Mr. Bidens 1992 remarks validated the Republicans current position.The focus of the day then shifted from the late Justice Scalia to the young Mr. Biden.At the White House, Mr. Obama pored through a thick binder of potential nominees with an eye toward choosing one within weeks. The White House on Monday said Mr. Obama had called senators in both parties to consult about the process.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined to put a time frame on the presidents decision-making, but officials have said he hoped to make a nomination within four to six weeks, matching his previous two Supreme Court vacancies.This is not a process that has to be rushed, but I think everybody understands that there is a sense of urgency in putting forward a nominee, Mr. Earnest said. He referred to the reticence of some Republicans to consider a nominee from Mr. Obama as an unreasonable position.Its inconsistent with their constitutional responsibility, and it certainly is inconsistent with the American peoples conception about what it means to do your job, he said.Mr. Earnest said there was some time-related pressure for the president to act, given that it would be unprecedented for a vacancy to span two court terms.As that argument was being made, Republicans were circulating C-SPAN video clips of Mr. Biden arguing the risk of leaving the court short of its full complement of nine justices was no reason to rush a confirmation.Others may fret that this approach would leave the court with only eight members for some time, Mr. Biden said then, but the cost of such a result  the need to reargue three or four cases that will divide the justices four to four  are quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, the president, the Senate, and the nation would have to pay for what would assuredly be a bitter fight, no matter how good a person is nominated by the president.In the end, he said, this may be the only course of action that historical practice and practical realism can sustain."}
{"text": "A woman from Staten Island was eulogized in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, on Monday, a cable television star who had a distinctive nickname and a distinctive voice and spoke in a distinctive New York patois; who bought a bigger house to have space for her 500 pairs of shoes and 300 pocketbooks; and who owned a bar that she said had become, like, a tourist trap.And who was known to millions of fans.The woman, Angela Raiola, was a linchpin on the VH1 series Mob Wives as well as the bubbly offshoot that took her nickname, Big Ang, for its title.Her connection to organized crime was through an uncle, Salvatore Lombardi, who had a nickname of his own, Sally Dogs. The creator and executive producer of Mob Wives, Jennifer Graziano, said last week that Ms. Raiola, 55, had died on Thursday of complications of cancer after she came down with pneumonia.In death, as in life, Ms. Raiola commanded a crowd. Hundreds attended her funeral Mass in the Renaissance Revival sanctuary of the Basilica of Regina Pacis, even two Mob Wives co-stars who, by some accounts, had been warned that they were not welcome. The Daily News said Karen Gravano and Brittany Fogarty had been told it was not a good idea to attend the wake, held on Sunday, or the funeral.Ms. Gravano  the daughter of the mob turncoat Salvatore Gravano, who testified against the Gambino boss John J. Gotti  apparently disregarded the advice. She slipped into the church without apparent incident.Ms. Fogarty, the daughter of John Fogarty, a reputed Mafia hit man, was not seen at the funeral. She said on VH1 that both of her parents were involved in illegal drug activity and organized crime and that her father had gone into the federal witness protection program. She also said that her father and Mr. Gravano, known as Sammy the Bull, knew each other from the time they spent as prison inmates together.Ms. Raiolas body arrived at the church in a gray Cadillac hearse shortly before the Mass began. Eight pallbearers lifted the gleaming silver coffin, which reflected the bright late-winter sun and the faces of mourners on the steps, who parted to make way.Jon Caramanica, a critic for The New York Times, once described Ms. Raiola as plastic-surgery-abetted, with a face Dali would have loved. He said she represented the Ghost of Mob Wives Future, standing on ones own after the good years with wiseguys have dried up.She herself complained, as only she could, about her fame. She complained about the interruptions from people who wanted snapshots with her.Like, I definitely cant go to the Staten Island Mall, she said. Thats out.In the sanctuary, the sacred mingled with the irreverent. Msgr. David L. Cassato, who celebrated the Mass, mostly referred to Ms. Raiola as Big Ang, not Angela. His place on the altar was not far from an enormous bouquet of red roses shaped like a pair of lips, a tribute to Ms. Raiolas pillowy mouth.Her estranged husband, Neil Murphy, with whom she had a fractious relationship, wore sunglasses, even inside the sanctuary. He took them off from time to time to wipe away tears.Big Ang was indeed fully human, Monsignor Cassato said in his homily. She loved, she laughed, she shared, she cared.He said she had gone to heaven. She is with God, he said at one point during the service. She is with her family. She is with all those in heaven.Other mourners remembered Ms. Raiola as a loving sister, mother, grandmother and fellow parishioner who ran fund-raisers for sick children. They also remembered how she had helped her Staten Island neighborhood recover after Hurricane Sandy and raised money at other untelevised moments.Anna DeNicola remembered that when her 7-year-old grandson Joseph DeNicola was dying, Ms. Raiola ran a fund-raiser to help with his medical bills. Ms. DeNicola said Ms. Raiola had also kept tabs on how the family was bearing up.She carried my family through like a shining star, Ms. DeNicola said.Monsignor Cassato held up a framed photograph of Ms. Raiola that he said he kept on his desk. Every time I look at it, he said, it brings back a beautiful memory of my friendship with Big Ang.One of those memories concerned a parish bazaar she had attended. Big Ang was helping run the raffle, he said, and approached him with a question that only someone with her background and her temperament would ask a priest:Whats my percentage? she asked."}
{"text": "BEIJING   The Chinese news media covered President Xi Jinpings most recent public appearances with adulation befitting a demigod.Front-page headlines across the nation trumpeted Mr. Xis visits to the headquarters of the three main Communist Party and state news organizations on Friday. Photographs showed fawning journalists crowding around Mr. Xi, who sat at an anchors desk at the state television network. One media official wrote the president an adoring poem.The blanket coverage reflected the brazen and far-reaching media policy announced by Mr. Xi on his choreographed tour: The Chinese news media exists to serve as a propaganda tool for the Communist Party, and it must pledge its fealty to Mr. Xi.Though the party has been tightening its control over the media since Mr. Xi became the top leader in late 2012, the new policy removes any doubt that in the view of the president and party chief, the media should be first and foremost a party mouthpiece. Mr. Xi wants to push the partys message domestically  and internationally  across all media platforms, including advertising and entertainment, scholars say. That is a shift from his predecessor, Hu Jintao, who stressed the need for the state-run media to become more responsive to the modern digital environment and shape or channel public opinion.All news media run by the party must work to speak for the partys will and its propositions, and protect the partys authority and unity, Mr. Xi told the gathered media officials on Friday, according to Xinhua, the state news agency.Mr. Xi also wants to curb the presence of foreign media companies. Last week, government agencies announced a regulation that would prevent foreign companies from publishing and distributing content online in China. That could affect Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, among others.Mr. Xis appearances on Friday were another major effort in his campaign to build a personality cult that equates him with the well-being of the party and the nation. The act of biao tai, or pledging loyalty, by newsroom leaders was one that Mr. Xi has demanded of military leaders and other important figures in the last year.That tightening of control has come as Mr. Xi faces pressure about Chinas economy, partywide corruption and widespread public frustration over pollution and environmental degradation.An essay in China Daily, the official English-language newspaper, offered an explanation on Monday about why Mr. Xi was unveiling his policy now.It is necessary for the media to restore peoples trust in the party, especially as the economy has entered a new normal and suggestions that it is declining and dragging down the global economy have emerged, the essay said.The nations media outlets are essential to political stability, and the leadership cannot afford to wait for them to catch up with the times, it said.Mr. Xis directives would also make it harder for foreign governments to determine which Chinese journalists operating in their countries are legitimate news gatherers and which ones are agents serving propaganda, intelligence or other official interests. The major party and state-run news organizations have been greatly expanding their operations overseas, including in the United States.Mr. Xis new policy came about because despite the continuing tightening of control of the media over the last three years, Xi is not fully assured that the state media, even the most central ones such as Xinhua and CCTV, are fully under his control, said Xiao Qiang, a scholar in Berkeley, Calif., who researches the partys information control.David Bandurski, the editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, said that under Xi Jinping, the centrality of the party is explicit for every single medium.I think the sense is, We own you, we run you, we tell you how things work, he said. The party is the center, and you serve our agenda. This is much more central now, and its being defined for all media platforms, from social media to commercial media.On Monday, in a sign of how officials were embracing Mr. Xis new policy, a website managed by the propaganda unit of the Beijing municipal party committee attacked a popular property tycoon, Ren Zhiqiang, who had criticized Mr. Xis speech on Friday. The site accused Mr. Ren, a party member, of having lost his party spirit and opposing the party after he wrote on his microblog that the media should be serving the people and not the party. The posts by Mr. Ren have been deleted.Under Mr. Xi, there has been a steady rollout of policies aimed at tightening control of every aspect of the media, including social networks, films and books.The latest such regulation, announced last week by two agencies, said that starting March 10, foreign companies  even ones that form joint ventures with Chinese partners  would not be allowed to publish and distribute online content. Many foreign publishers and producers of online content aimed at a Chinese audience are based overseas, but a handful have significant operations or joint ventures in China that may be in jeopardy, including Microsoft and Apple, which has a Chinese App Store. Amazon sells e-books in China and operates Amazon.cn.Articles on Mr. Xis policy speech, which was not immediately released in full, said the president also demanded that journalists and news organizations strictly adhere to the news viewpoint of Marxism and raise high the banner  phrases that mean advancing the interests of the party.Mr. Xis policy has been building piecemeal. In 2013, the government began requiring all Chinese journalists to take a test in order to get their press cards renewed, with the aim, among other things, of getting news gatherers to uphold the Marxist journalistic ideals more consciously.That year, Chinas top legal bodies said the criminal charge of picking quarrels and provoking trouble could apply to online speech. Since then, the authorities have used it as a cudgel to silence dissent on the Internet.In several prominent cases, officials have persecuted journalists for everything from sharing information with foreigners to spreading rumors related to the stock markets and the economy.Chinese news organizations, including formerly adventurous and commercially driven ones like Southern Weekly, are toeing the line. Peoples Daily has become a publicity machine for Mr. Xi. On one day in December, his name appeared in 11 of the 12 headlines on the front page.Some political analysts note that Mr. Xis attempts to impose total control over the media say as much about his personal insecurities as they do about any Marxist-Leninist ideological vision that he holds.The most important thing is for him to announce his absolute authority, said Zhang Lifan, a historian. He doesnt feel effective and confident in dealing with problems, and he lacks a sense of security.Mr. Zhang added, He worries the Chinese Communist Party will lose political power, and he also worries that his peers will shove him from his position."}
{"text": "Four years ago, in the first draft of my book A Capitalism for the People, I had a section dedicated to how worrisome a Donald J. Trump presidential bid would be for America. I was not prescient. Its just that having grown up in Italy, I knew how a real estate tycoon  in this case, Silvio Berlusconi  whose career exemplified crony capitalism could become the leader of supposed pro-market forces, and I knew what it meant for the country.I cut this section after being told that my point was irrelevant: In America, there was no chance that a character like Mr. Trump would ever be seriously considered as a candidate.Then 2016 happened: After sweeping wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Mr. Trump has shattered that notion. The Trump phenomenon caught everybody by surprise. Yet it is a manifestation of a fundamental contradiction long present in the Republican Party: Despite fierce anti-big-business sentiment among many Republican voters, no Republican candidate has emerged to champion them.This contradiction created the space for Mr. Trump. In spite of being every bit a part of that pro-business establishment, Mr. Trump can pretend to be anti-establishment by sometimes reviling big business, because he doesnt need its funding for his campaign.Among self-identified Republicans in a 2010 Booth-Kellogg survey, 43 percent agreed that big business distorts the functioning of markets to its own advantage, and only 22 percent disagreed. But the Republican establishment has happily become big businesss mouthpiece. This fracture became evident during the congressional debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program: Many Republicans in the House voted against it, even though it came from George W. Bush, a Republican.The Tea Party grew, at least in part, out of this tension, as did the surprising defeat of Representative Eric Cantor, then majority leader of the House, in a Virginia Republican primary in 2014. Mr. Cantor was accused by his opponent, David Brat, of representing large corporations seeking insider deals, crony bailouts and a constant supply of low-wage workers.Why have so few serious anti-establishment candidates emerged in the Republican presidential primaries? A grass-roots campaign for a House or Senate seat is within financial reach for some people, but not a presidential run. Without the support of big business, a Republican candidate would be unable to raise that kind of money.But Mr. Trump does not need rich donors. To his supporters, he appears to be a free-market evangelist. According to the latest Booth-Kellogg survey, 38 percent of American voters think that Mr. Trump has the most pro-market platform of any candidate (a lead of 13 points over the next candidate). If a cursory glance at his very vague platform  heavy import tax on China, a wall against immigration, etc.  is not sufficient to see how misplaced this trust is, look at Mr. Trumps career.As a businessman Mr. Trump has a longstanding habit of using his money and power aggressively to obtain special deals from the government. For example, his Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan was built with the benefit of a decades-long tax abatement obtained through government connections.In 1985, Mr. Trump circumvented New York State campaign-finance laws by making a $30,000 donation, through several Trump companies, to Andrew Stein, the Manhattan borough president who was running for president of the City Council. Mr. Stein was also a member of the New York City Board of Estimate, the body then responsible for land-use decisions in New York.Finally, Mr. Trump has a long history of promoting eminent-domain abuses to expropriate private land he wanted.He is, in short, the essence of that commingling of big business and government that goes under the name of crony capitalism.We cannot blame voters for being confused about pro-business versus pro-market politicians. The Republican establishment deserves most of the responsibility. Being pro-market means being in favor of competition and against excessive concentration, as Theodore Roosevelt was. Business executives are pro-market when they want to enter a new sector.But when they become established in a sector, they favor entry restrictions, excessive licensing, distortive regulation and corporate subsidies. Those policies are pro-business (in the sense that they favor existing businesses), but they are harmful and distort a competitive market economy.With the pretense of defending free markets, the Republican Party consistently supported big business. When did any Republican presidential candidate  other than Mr. Trump  speak in favor of some antitrust enforcement? When did he campaign for tougher enforcement against white-collar crime? When did anyone call for free trade in pharmaceuticals? Or for more competitive pricing of drugs bought by Medicare?The forced identification between the interest of markets and that of business practiced by the Republican establishment in the last 30 years made it easier for Republican voters to fall for Mr. Trump, a businessman who pretends to uphold free-market principles.It is an indication of a countrys institutional corruption when inside a main party the only alternative to the prevailing crony capitalism is a tycoon with a long history of shady deals."}

{"text": "Before todays corporate-sponsored arena concerts and big-money endorsement deals, there was a time in hip-hop when its stars were not far from the people and places that gave rise to the culture. LL Cool J could go to a high school in East Harlem and perform to an adoring crowd, or DMC could hang out in Hollis, Queens, and chill out by an ice cream truck.Those days seem as distant as the time when shell-top Adidas and shearling coats were in style. But images from that era form the core of a new collection acquired by the Smithsonians National Museum of African American History and Culture. Obtained from Bill Adler, the writer and former music industry publicist, they offer a survey of hip-hops golden era, reflecting its energy, style and fun (although it also includes some images taken in the 2000s).Among those represented are many pioneering female rappers like Sha-Rock, Queen Latifah and Roxanne Shant, revered elders like Rakim and Afrika Bambaataa and cut-ups like Biz Markie and Flavor Flav. Some of these images will be on display when the much-anticipated museum opens in the fall.The culture has morphed and changed as things do over time, but these pictures speak to the grass roots nature of it, said Rhea L. Combs, the museums curator of film and photography. That is the special quality of this collection. It touches on all of those important moments that are kind of nostalgic: You had jams, you had concerts, you had street ciphers. It included not just the M.C., but the D.J., the dancers and graffiti artists. This collection epitomized a nice constellation of these important moments of a very real and American moment in history.Mr. Adlers interest in these images  which were collected during his time running Eyejammie Fine Arts, a hip-hop photo gallery in Chelsea in the early 2000s  reflects a longstanding interest in documenting the music that interested him. In college, where he was a young music critic for the Ann Arbor Sun, he began tracking down photos and other information about the acts he would be reviewing. At record stores, he realized, there were publicity photos, posters and other items that too often wound up in the trash. He soon began to scoop them up.He already had material on some hip-hop artists by 1984, when he went to work for Russell Simmons as director of publicity at Def Jam records. In that job, he was able to commission photographers to make images of the labels acts.I also had my historians hat on, Mr. Adler said. I would keep a copy of everything we produced. I had been doing some of that before, but I started doing it intensely while working for Russell.The images in the collection are done by a range of photographers, including Janette Beckman, David Corio, Ricky Powell, Michael Benabib and Harry Allen. From studio portraits to candids back in the neighborhood, some of them portray a certain ease, intimacy and trust. In some you see artists like Queen Latifah as they first took the scene; KRS-One with his then-wife Ms. Melodie; the Beastie Boys goofing around or Run-DMC posing with the Eiffel Tower in the background.Some images still have the power to surprise, like a shot of Big Daddy Kane getting his hair shaped up before going onstage (Slide 2).I love that one, Mr. Adler said. It seemed like the kind of photo youd see in Life magazine a generation ago, so everyday but also exalted in a way.That everyday nature spoke powerfully to Ms. Combs, who grew up in Detroit listening to the music of many of the artists in the collection.This was my generations Motown, she said. Its who I am. When I think about my youth, I think about getting dressed listening to Bonita Applebum, reading Vibe magazine cover to cover. Its part of my identity. Its a language that helped shape my language and the lens through with I understand the world.That lens was just as much influenced by Russell Simmons, who Mr. Adler said had a keen understanding of the music and its roots. He said that while Motown had its singers take pointers on how to dress and talk as a way to appeal to mainstream audiences, Mr. Simmons insisted that hip-hop culture did not need to be toned down.He made it clear to me that its not just rap music, but a whole culture from a super-creative community, Mr. Adler said. A generation after Motown, Russell thought we didnt have to water down that culture in order to cross over. In fact, were going to do what we do at full strength and pull the mainstream in our direction. We didnt cross over to them. They crossed over to us.Follow @dgbxny and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "At the risk offlogging adead parrot, let me rise briefly to the defense of my pundits fantasy from yesterday against Noah Millmans withering attack. Millman makes two arguments against Marco Rubio offering John Kasich the veep slot. First, that it would help Ted Cruz:Think about it. Cruz is positioned as Mr. Solid Gold Conservative in the race. Kasich is running as a self-proclaimed relative moderate. If Rubio offered Kasich the VP slot,hed be playing right into Cruzs script. He betrayed us with the Gang of Eight  and now hes offered theVice Presidency to a man who supports Obamacare. What other conservative causes will he betray if we give him the keys to the White House? Is that really the message he wants out there going into Super Tuesday?And second that it would make Rubio look weak, and unnecessarily so: its also unnecessary given the geography of the upcoming contests. Kasich has basically abandoned the fight for the majority of Super Tuesday states. Hes not going to be a major factor in Georgia, Oklahoma, or Arkansas  all states where Rubio has polled very competitively in the past month. He may try to make himself a factor in Virginia or Minnesota, two other states where Rubio has polled if anything even more competitively  but so what? Kasich was polling at 2% in Minnesota a month ago, when Rubio was polling in the lead. If Rubios stock drops, and Kasich rises to, I dont know  10%?  how exactly is that a knock on Kasich, as opposed to an indication that Rubio just cant closethe sale?Rubio has a path to the nomination. It involves winning at least a handfulof states that are effectively three-person races between himself, Trump and Cruz, in Super Tuesday states where the terrain isfar from unfavorable for him. If theres a real split on Super Tuesday, with Cruz winning, say, Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska, Rubio winning Virginia, Minnesota and Georgia, and Trump winning Massachusetts, Vermont, Arkansas, Tennessee and Alabama  then even though Trump will be the clear delegate leader, there will be three viable candidates. Kasich will collapse, and Rubio can go intothe big winner-take-all contests on March 15th having made a credible case for his candidacy  and a far more-credible one than Cruz will have. Its really not clear to me why Rubio needs to drive Kasich out of the race to make that scenario happen.To Millmans first point, I suppose Im a little skeptical that in this particular post-ideological, LOLnothingmatters year the Obamacare attack on Rubio-Kasich would actually stick. But I agree that this gamble wouldnt make a lot of sense going into Super Tuesday, for basically the reasons Millman lists. I imagined it much more as a move for the week after the SEC primary, when Michigan (current polling: Trump 35, Kasich 17, Rubio 12) looms up as the big prize, with Ohio and Illinois waiting in the wings on March 15th. At that point, most of the South will have voted, and the perils of giving Cruz ammunition for his True Conservative crusadeseem likethey might be outweighed by the benefits of allying with a son of the Midwest.Millman thinks not, on the grounds that if Rubio has a decent Super Tuesday then Kasich will collapse and become a non-factor anyway. But what does collapse mean here? Yes, I expect that Kasich wont be polling in the mid-teens (as in Michigan) or the low twenties (his numbers in Ohio) after heloses everywhereon March 1; thats why, as I said, I dont think he has any kind of credible path to the nomination. But as Ben Carson is presently demonstrating, you can collapse as a candidate and still be a spoilerin a close three-way or two-way race, and so long as he keeps campaigning, spending money and debating it would not surprise me at all if Kasichhad a floor say, 10percent in Michigan and especially Ohio no matter how well Rubio performs in the next ten days. And in a race in which Cruz isnt about to drop out and Trump has consolidated a bloc that seems likely to vote for him no matter what, that 10 percent is actually a prize, and could turn out to be the difference between Rubio emerging as the nominee and the Trumperdammerung.Yes, veepingKasich in a bid to claim his voterswould be an admission of a certain weakness, as I acknowledged yesterday. But then again itwould also be a statement of a certain strength, since Kasich wouldnt get something for nothing: He would have to concede that Rubio, not he, should be the nominee; he would be partneringup, but also surrendering. And note, again, that I would not be making this argument if I did not think that Kasich is a pretty good fit as a running mate for Rubio no matter what, so its not as if he would be making some sort of (alas, Palin) reckless gamble with his veep slot. (I would not urge a Rubi0-Carson ticket, for instance.)Millmans final point is that theres no magic plan that can make Rubio the nominee; he can only make himself the nominee, by running a stronger campaign that he has to date. That seems rightbut part of running a strong campaign, especially in a wacky year like this one, is being willing to take some risks and show some creativity in the face of unexpected events. Ever since Jebs weakness left the alleged establishment lane open, Rubios strategy has been very, very risk-averse, on the (not unreasonable) theory that the nomination might just fall to him eventually. That he nowneeds to reach out and actually claim it is a point where Millman and I agree; hence my recent argumentthat Rubio needs to actually fight Trump, a fight hes still mostly ducking. But all Im saying with this particular pundits fantasy is that there are many ways to seize the moment, and in a year this strange one of the stranger ways might also be worth considering."}
{"text": "One of Saturdays biggest election surprises was the entrance and exit polling measuring Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucus. It found that Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton by eight percentage points among Hispanic voters, overturning months of conventional wisdom about Mrs. Clintons strength among nonwhites.But there are a lot of reasons to question the findings from the polls. They have a small sample of precincts and voters, and they simply were not devised to provide precise estimates of the Hispanic vote.The actual election returns in Las Vegass Clark County hint at a different story. Analyzed neighborhood by neighborhood, they suggest that Mrs. Clinton might have won the Hispanic vote by a comfortable margin. She won about 60 percent of delegates in heavily Hispanic areas, a result that calls the finding of the polling into question.There is not much evidence, though, that Mrs. Clinton won Hispanic voters by the sort of landslide margin that she did eight years ago. Thats a good sign for Mr. Sanders, who needs to make up for the huge swing among black voters, who have gone from uniformly for President Obama to uniformly for Mrs. Clinton.But the finding that Mr. Sanders won the Hispanic vote is at best extremely questionable  and, at worst, wrong.The Hispanic vote in Nevada is overwhelmingly concentrated in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. In particular, Hispanic voters are concentrated on the east side of the city, where they make up the vast majority of the population but only a slight majority of registered Democrats. (For a rough map, see this tweet.)In the 76 precincts in Clark County where we believe that a plurality of registered Democrats are Hispanic, Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Sanders in the delegate count by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent. In the smaller number of majority Hispanic precincts, she seemed to win about 60 percent of the delegates, and she won perhaps 65 percent of the delegates in the precincts where Hispanics appeared to be a particularly large share of registered Democrats. (For details on the estimates, see my note at the end of the article.)Similarly, it was widely reported that Mrs. Clinton fared extremely well in the precincts along the Las Vegas Strip.Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign press secretary, tweeted that the campaign estimated that Mrs. Clinton won 61 percent of the vote in Hispanic precincts throughout the state.Does that prove the entrance polls were wrong, as Mr. Fallon said? Not on its own. Its dangerous to infer much about the preferences of a demographic group based on the results of the areas where they live. Hispanic voters who live in majority Hispanic areas might be particularly likely to support Mrs. Clinton. In other words, focusing only on the places where Hispanic voters are most prevalent could provide a misleading picture of Hispanic voters over all. We know that this is an issue in other contexts: Similar analysis would overestimate the Democratic share of the vote among Hispanic voters, or the Republican vote among white voters.A Democratic pollster unaffiliated with either campaign said that Mr. Sanders does better among nonwhite voters in areas where whites represent a larger share of the population, which would suggest that a precinct-based analysis would understate Mr. Sanderss strength.Theres another problem: There were relatively few homogeneous precincts, where almost all of the voters are Hispanic. Even the majority Hispanic precincts in Nevada have large numbers of non-Hispanic voters, who themselves could have been likelier to support Mrs. Clinton (though the findings still hold if one excludes the precincts where there appear to be an above-average number of black voters, who favored Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin).But it is a stretch to say that Mr. Sanders could have done so well among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas that he overcame a deficit in relatively Hispanic areas, where a large proportion of the Hispanic population lives.Precinct data isnt perfect. But I would take it over this entrance/exit poll.In general, entrance/exit polls are not well suited to measure the Hispanic vote. This one is particularly problematic.Over all, the poll included just 1,024 respondents  and just 213 Hispanic respondents. In a normal poll, that would imply a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.But these types of polls are not normal. The margin of error is even higher, at 7 percent, and the true error can easily be much higher.Thats because an entrance-exit poll isnt a random sample of the population like a normal poll. Its a random sample of precincts, usually between 15 and 60 in a state exit poll. This one had just 25 precincts. Race is not usually used as a criteria for selecting precincts.Precinct selection introduces a whole new dimension of error into an entrance-exit poll for Hispanic voters, or any demographic group thats concentrated in small areas. The 25 precincts could overrepresent an unrepresented group  imagine if a New York exit poll, by chance, included two Orthodox Jewish precincts in Brooklyn and showed a Republican ahead among Jewish voters  or completely miss a small, geographically concentrated group.You can imagine how this could wind up creating the opposite risk of the precinct analysis: What if the entrance-exit poll simply doesnt include a heavily Hispanic precinct where Mrs. Clinton excelled? The danger is real with a sample as small as this, especially in a highly diverse state.This type of problem is responsible for one of the biggest exit poll controversies in memory: the finding that 44 percent of Hispanic voters supported George W. Bush in 2004. Simply by chance, 3 of the 11 plurality Hispanic precincts were in Miami-Dade County, where Hispanic voters are particularly conservative. The 44 percent finding was four points higher than the result from a compilation of the 50 state exit polls  a difference well outside the formal margin of error for a sample of that size.The exit pollsters are upfront about the issue, as they acknowledged in the exit polls postelection analysis in 2004:And thats for a national exit poll of 10 times as many precincts as the one in Nevada.The exit polls have also been criticized for other issues measuring Hispanic voters, like whether pollsters conduct Spanish-language interviews. They generally do not, although Spanish-language questionnaires are typically offered in Nevada and other states with large Hispanic populations.In a December interview, Joe Lenski, who runs the exit polls for Edison Research, acknowledged that exit polls are not the precise measurement of demographics that people would want them to be. He said that he cringes when people say Oh, thats the number and run with it as absolute truths or precise numbers.Referring specifically to the Nevada results, Mr. Lenski added that there are additional errors with caucus and entrance polls. The entrance poll measures initial preferences  those can change at the caucus, and uncommitted is an option that received 3 percent support in initial preference. The delegate tallies dont necessarily line up with actual vote counts, either; the delegates are allocated only after candidates get 15 percent of the vote. In other words, a candidate could win 60 percent of the delegates without winning 60 percent of the vote.There were signs of problems Saturday in poll results themselves. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were tied in the initial entrance-exit poll estimates; she ultimately won by around 5.5 points. Clearly the entrance polls missed Mrs. Clintons strength somewhere.Is it possible that the precincts missed Mrs. Clintons strength among Hispanic voters in Clark County? Quite possibly. Even the final entrance-exit poll numbers show Mrs. Clinton leading in Clark County by just 5 points; she actually won there by 10 points.Its tough to give a poll subsample of some 200 respondents much weight, especially when its for a clustered group like Hispanics.Its even harder to give it credit when theres so much reason to wonder whether its right. Mrs. Clinton fared well in majority Hispanic precincts. National polls show Mrs. Clinton faring well among Hispanic voters  and Mr. Sanders basically finished in line with national polls among both white and black voters.All evidence considered, and although we cant know for sure, Id err on the side of a Clinton win among Hispanic voters.But it would be hard to argue that she won Hispanic voters by a lot. Sixty percentage points could easily be too high if she indeed fared better among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas. The entrance-exit poll result may not be perfect, but it certainly seems consistent with this possibility. If I had to bet, Id say she won Hispanic voters by a somewhat more modest margin.It would still imply that Mr. Sanders made big gains over the last month. But it would still be short of what he would need to overcome Mrs. Clintons vast strength among black voters. She won them by a huge margin, whether you look at the entrance-exit polling or majority black precincts.  In assessing delegate counts, the estimates used are not perfect. They were based by matching  visually  the precinct results reported by the Nevada Democratic Party to estimates of the racial composition of registered Democrats from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor. Even if the matching effort was perfect, the estimates of the racial composition of registered Democrats would not be: They are based on the racial composition of census tracts and the surnames of voters. The data is often used for analysis of Latino voting trends, including by the firm Latino Decisions. The L2 data shows that 23 percent of registered Democrats in Nevada are Hispanic, a hair above the exit poll estimates for the caucus vote."}
{"text": "Depending on who you ask, Chelseas Maritime Hotel could be seen as proof of the architect Albert C. Ledners inspired vision  or a monolithic monument to 1960s kitsch. Originally designed as a hiring hall for the National Maritime Union, the 11-story, porthole-adorned tower has since served as a shelter for runaways and as housing for the New York Service Center for Chinese Study Fellows, before opening as a fashionable hotel in 2003.Now, the buildings storied history also includes La Sirena, chef Mario Batalis first New York restaurant in a decade. Since its in a hotel, and because we have this magnificent location, it will function as the piazza at the center of a small town, says Batali, who hopes the restaurant and bar becomes a bustling hive of activity. You can have breakfast here, lunch here, late-night snack here. Its kind of a cross between Lupa and Babbo  and yet available in a much wider and more recognizable way, he says, citing two of his high-end Manhattan establishments. Food-style wise, its kind of like a trattoria.Asked whether the hotels nautical flourishes have inspired the menu, Batali says he preferred to keep the two sensibilities separate. We wanted to honor the marine tradition, and La Sirena is a little doff of the hat to that, but the food is more like what I want to do now, within the confines of classic Italian food. Still, Batali, a fan of Homers Odyssey, felt a name with aquatic flair was only appropriate. My tie to the marine culture is something a little more macabre, he says. I love the idea that the sirens would sing the songs and the passing ships could not avoid them, like all the traffic on Ninth Avenue.La Sirenas dcor plays off the 60s architecture with a retro flair. This could be a Fellini set, right? Look at that floor, look at that lighting, look at the Caesarstone walls, says Batali, surveying the restaurant from the corner of its expansive bar. (Batali has admitted that La Sirenas opulence had a high price: Originally set to open months ago, the restaurant ballooned millions over budget.) This is a different beast for us, he says. Serving all the way through the day is something that is going to give us more fun to play around with. Eventually well have a high tea in the afternoon. The world has changed a lot, and were embracing it. Batali is also considering limiting meals to the tables, except for a cart that carries salami, Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano and marinated olives. I like the idea of a stand-alone bar, because if Im at a hotel, I dont want to be aced out by 34 seats of people eating their dinner. I want to go have drinks.The restaurant marks a first for Batali, too, in that all-day service necessitates that he include breakfast. This is, keep in mind, the first time Im able to have a breakfast menu in my whole life, he says. There arent many breakfast restaurants in Italy. Unless youre in a hotel, breakfast is really a brioche and a cappuccino. His challenge was to create a menu that maintained the spirit of Italian cooking but incorporated traditional American fare. The eggs in purgatorio, for me, are exactly how I want to eat them, with a slightly spicy tomato sauce, he says. But just being able to come in here and have a perfect plate of 24-month Galloni prosciutto with grilled bread and fig jam, and the additional soft cheese, thats kind of what I want to eat eight days out of 10. Though Batali himself prefers a savory breakfast  Id just as soon eat cold Chinese food with Tabasco sauce, he says  he has guests with a sweet tooth covered. The mascarpone amaretti pancakes are going to be my kids favorite thing, he says.To celebrate the opening, Batali has shared his recipe for duck egg with polenta and herb-almond pesto, which patrons can order starting tomorrow at 7 a.m. For me, a duck egg is a supremely more satisfying experience than a chicken egg, though I love chicken eggs, he says. A duck egg just has more viscosity to the yolk, a thickness to the white and its a little bit more substantial. The polenta in the dish, he says, is essentially grits. Grits, however, for me, have always been a little too firm. This will be the soft texture of almost a velout soup. Batali describes the dish as a perfect marriage of both the American sensibility of breakfast and an Italian lunch. Odysseus should have been so lucky.Yield: 4 servings4 cups water1 cup stone-ground polentaSalt and pepper to tasteExtra virgin olive oil1 bunch parsley ( cup leaves reserved for garnish)1 bunch mint ( cup leaves reserved for garnish)1 bunch basil ( cup leaves reserved for garnish) cup chopped toasted almonds4 extra large duck eggs1 lemon wedge1. In a small sauce pot, bring the water to a boil and slowly whisk in the polenta. When the polenta is incorporated, bring to a simmer and cook for one to one and a half hours, stirring almost constantly. Once polenta has reached a creamy consistency, season with salt and pepper and add enough of the best olive oil you can find until you start to feel guilty. Cover the pot with plastic wrap and leave on a warm part of the stove.2. In a food processor, add the herbs, almonds and enough oil to make the mixture wet. Pulse until the mixture comes together and has a coarse texture. Cover with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and then cover in plastic wrap.3. An easy and delicious way to prepare the duck eggs is to pan-fry them in olive oil in a nonstick pan with a bit of salt and pepper. For presentation, we put four ring molds on a baking tray. Preheat the molds in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes, then put a little bit of olive oil on the ring mold so the egg does not stick. Pre-crack the eggs into small individual bowls. While the molds and baking tray are still hot, gently place the egg into each mold. Season with salt and pepper and bake for eight to ten minutes.4. While the eggs are cooking, scoop the hot polenta onto the plate. (Make sure the polenta is loose enough so that it cascades to the edge of the plate.) Gently remove the egg from the ring and, using a spatula, place each egg on top of the polenta in the center of the plate. Dress the remaining herbs with olive oil, salt, pepper and lemon juice and nest on top of the egg white. Drizzle the pesto around so that it dots the polenta."}
{"text": "The other day, a host on MSNBC asked me if Donald J. Trump had a good enough campaign operation to win in Nevada. One thing Mr. Trump had going for him, I pointed out, was that he was very good at getting the news media to give him free airtime.Every time he opens his mouth, hes on national TV, telling jokes and giving his message  so hes saved himself tens of millions of dollars doing that, I said. Almost as soon as I finished making my point, the network demonstrated it by cutting to a Trump rally in Atlanta.Such is the unusual world of Mr. Trumps political finances. As a reporter who covers campaign finance, I spend my days trying to figure out where the money is. But Mr. Trump presents a different sort of challenge: Not so much where the money is, but where the money isnt.The only person who has spent less money running for president than Mr. Trump  and who hasnt yet stopped running for president  is John Kasich. This is partly because Mr. Trump was famous in his own right before he plunged into the 2016 race. It is also partly because many of Mr. Trumps campaign expenses, such as rides on his own private jets and helicopters, or borrowing aides from his real estate empire, get paid out to his own companies.But even beyond that, it is because Mr. Trump doesnt spend much on television ads, usually the single most expensive budget item for a modern presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump garners what political hacks call earned media. He holds big rallies, says provocative things that his audience adores  Id like to punch him in the face, Mr. Trump said of a heckler at his event in Nevada on Monday  and reaps of a wave of news coverage in newspapers and on television. This dynamic has earned the scorn of Trump-haters on the right and left, who have taken to blaming the news media for enabling Mr. Trumps rise.Mr. Trump is undeniably a showman. Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a poll-tested message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the earned-media department, then proceeded to trump Mr. Trump, with a 20-minute riff on squirmishes and proud clingers.)Just how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals  Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  are spending a combined $1.5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday.Mr. Trumps bill?Zero."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  The former prop house at 720 North Cahuenga Boulevard was once old Hollywood. Into the 1990s, it housed props from police shows like Hill Street Blues.The buildings newly installed glass doors were recently opened to prospective tenants. Docler Media, based in Luxembourg, installed its technology and film production division in the 33,173-square-foot building, which has concrete floors and 30-foot bow-truss ceilings, subway tile showers, a kitchen that seems out of a Nancy Meyers movie, yoga studio and full bar.The property is the 12th in a portfolio of so-called creative office spaces in Los Angeles from the developer Robert Herscu. They have attracted tenants like Mashable, the apparel company Outerknown and the animation studio Animal Logic. Mr. Herscu, who is chief executive of HQ Creative Office, said he expected that 720 North Cahuenga would lease quickly.Traditionally you think of amenities as great parking and A.C., said John Kim, a principal at Miren.Co and co-founder of Opodz, a co-working space in the Little Tokyo neighborhood.Thats still all very important, he said. But if you can say theres on-site laundry, a cool kitchen area, theres a little dog park  that helps landlords land and attract more tenants, especially in the tech sector.In Los Angeles, that kind of space has been specifically positioned for more creative firms, rather than those in fields like insurance, law and finance, according to John D. Zanetos, senior vice president for brokerage services at the commercial real estate services firm CBRE in Los Angeles. But that is changing.Whether youre an entertainment firm or a law firm, what we hear consistently is that companies are trying to enhance collaboration and deliver a workplace that will enhance that, Mr. Zanetos said.The audience for this type of space isnt the normal cast of characters, he said. Its growing.Petra Durnin, CBREs director of research and analysis for Southern California, estimated the Los Angeles County office space market at 200 million square feet. Technology and creative tenants lease 38 percent, roughly 76 million square feet, she said.Going forward, another 30 million square feet of tenants will be expiring and then renewing, Ms. Durnin said, speaking of the next five years. From that pool were looking at everybody turning to some kind of creative space. Eventually all office-using tenants will be in some sort of creative.The city has a number of office buildings dating back to the early 1900s with the requisite exposed brick and wood-beamed ceilings. There is also a vast amount of industrial space built from the early 1900s to the 1980s, a vestige of a once-robust manufacturing economy.L.A. has this unique combination of historic office buildings and industrial product thats no longer useful in the way it was originally intended, Mr. Zanetos said.Cory Bird, a co-producer on the television shows Bates Motel, The Strain and Colony at Carlton Cuse Productions, often searches for spaces like these. The company produces television shows with sometimes unpredictable schedules and changing needs. This means maintaining multiple offices.In our Bates Motel building, everyones under one roof and theres a real community environment, Mr. Bird said.That building in Sherman Oaks comes closest to fulfilling the needs of a production: a suitable writers room, space for casting and the capacity to handle the terabytes of digital information used in postproduction. Yet Mr. Bird still faces challenges.If we come in with postproduction, a lot of times well have to overhaul the entire Internet setup, he said, speaking of not-quite-enough web power. He looks forward to an influx of available space tailored to what he will need.Ronen Olshansky is chief executive and co-founder of Cross Campus, a working-space company with two locations in Los Angeles and a third on the way. The company provides fully managed office space with amenities on a membership basis. Its an alternative to signing a longer-term lease on an office space, something attractive to start-ups and small companies.If you asked us a year ago when we started Cross Campus, we would have said thats going to work for offices of up to about 10 people, Mr. Olshansky said. What were starting to see is most of the demand coming from 20-, 40-person offices. That same value proposition still exists.He added, Tenants arent just limited to creative companies. Weve got financial companies, law firms, branding, design, advertising. Its a really wide cross section.According to CBRE, the law firm Hueston Hennigan leased space in the PacMutual complex in downtown Los Angeles in 2015. Avery Dennison, the global packaging corporation, leased in the trendy Arts District, joining the venture capital firm Greycroft Partners after its move there from Santa Monica in 2014. CBRE itself expanded into a rehabilitated 1928 Masonic Temple in Glendale this year.The Masonic Temples 37-foot ceilings, stadium staircase seating and 24-hour concierge illustrate the kind of adaptive reuse these spaces employ.CBREs workplace division was a consultant on CBREs downtown and Masonic Temple offices.That group started off as 12 people; now there are over 50, said Lewis C. Horne, who heads the firms Los Angeles/Orange County region. We would not go to meet with a tenant without bringing our workplace strategy professionals.It used to be a broker would go out and find space because it was in the right location, Mr. Horne said.People would move in, put perimeter offices around the edge of the space, he added. The core would be support, and away youd go. Thats just not what were doing anymore. Now theres wellness components, this concierge idea, natural light. The line between your home and your office really blurs.Los Angeles comprises many smaller regions that Mr. Zanetos says have reached a critical mass. On the west side, Playa Vista has attracted tech, entertainment and design companies. Burbank, to the north, is home to two major studios  Warner Bros. and Disney  and the companies that do business with them. Both areas have a high concentration of tenants desiring different spaces.Theres an effort to bring down real estate costs, said Eric Sussman, senior lecturer of accounting at the University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management.Costs of doing business here are quite high. This can reduce the amount of square footage per employee, he said.According to the CoreNet Global Corporate Real Estate 2020 survey of 500 corporate real estate executives, the average square footage per employee dropped to 176 square feet in 2012, from 225 square feet in 2010. It is projected to hit 151 square feet per employee in 2017 nationwide.You had this move to very traditional space in the 80s, 90s, 2000s, Mr. Sussman said. And now youre getting this other stream where everythings open and youre sitting in peoples laps. The dogs are roaming the concrete floors.And tenants are willing to pay.When the developer Rising Realty acquired the PacMutual complex in 2012 for $60 million, rent went for $2 a square foot, according to CBRE. Rising transformed the traditional office space and then sold it to Callahan Capital Properties and Ivanhoe Cambridge.When a developer goes in and buys a historic office building, those buildings need love. They need money, said Mr. Zanetos of CBRE. Elevators need to be modernized; HVAC and electrical need updates. Data is critical. Nobody can function without high-speed Internet.PacMutual just achieved rent of $4 a square foot.Similarly, in the Arts District, industrial rents go for 65 cents a square foot per month triple net, meaning the tenant is responsible for taxes, insurance and maintenance. A lease was just recorded in a converted 1920s industrial building at $3 a square foot triple net.In L.A., these buildings that were once looked at as obsolete are now being rediscovered, Mr. Zanetos said.Mr. Kim of Miren observed, Its like Field of Dreams  if you build it they will come."}
{"text": "Updated, 6:23 p.m. | Mitt Romney emerged from political hibernation on Wednesday and issued a challenge to Donald J. Trump: Show us your taxes.Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, raised serious questions about the partys apparent front-runner for the nomination this year, suggesting that there was most likely something unseemly in Mr. Trumps tax returns and that perhaps the Manhattan businessman was not as rich as he likes to let on.Frankly, I think we have good reason to believe that theres a bombshell in Donald Trumps taxes, Mr. Romney said in an interview with Fox News.Asked what he meant, Mr. Romney shared some theories: Either hes not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasnt been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay, or perhaps he hasnt been giving money to the vets or to the disabled like hes been telling us hes been doing.The remarks from Mr. Romney come as mainstream Republicans have grown increasingly nervous that Mr. Trump will be the partys nominee. Mr. Romney expressed little hope that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas could break through at this point.Donald Trump has the clearest path to become the Republican nominee, Mr. Romney said in some of his most expansive public comments on the state of the campaign. I think for the other people still in the race, their path is becoming a slimmer and slimmer opening, and theyre having a difficult time communicating to their supporters just how they could become the nominee.Mr. Romney said that he was not singling out Mr. Trump per se, and that he thought all of the candidates should release their tax information before Republican voters pick a nominee.Firing back on Twitter, Mr. Trump said that he did not intend to take political advice from Mr. Romney. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2016Mr. Romney, who is a multimillionaire, released his tax returns in early 2012 after coming under pressure from Democrats. By calling on Mr. Trump to do the same, Mr. Romney, a two-time presidential candidate, is, in a way, taking a page out of the playbook of Senator Harry Reid, who had accused Mr. Romney of not paying taxes for years.Mr. Trump has said publicly that he will release his tax information in the coming months and that the delay has been due to the complexity of his finances. He claims to be worth $10 billion and has said that he pays as little taxes as possible because he loathes how the government spends his money.Having heard such excuses before, Mr. Romney said that even returns from previous years would be helpful.The reason I think there is a bombshell in there is because every time he is asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays and says, Well, were working on it,' Mr. Romney said. Hey, were not talking about the taxes that are coming due this year. We are talking about taxes already filed, back taxes.When the information is eventually released, Mr. Romney will be eager to see what Mr. Trump is hiding.Frankly, the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be, he said.Mr. Romney has come under some pressure from allies of Mr. Rubio to endorse him, in the hopes of demonstrating a show of force that could compel Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to leave the race. But Mr. Romney has told allies that he isnt ready yet to make an endorsement.However, he has been incensed by Mr. Trumps rise, according to people familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing private conversations.The question of unreleased tax returns dogged Mr. Romney throughout the 2012 race. When he finally released them that September, he was hammered for having paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent.Some Republican pundits have publicly told Mr. Trump that he was taking a risk waiting to release his returns."}
{"text": "Elvis Presley often referred to Fats Domino as the real king of rock n roll, but this octogenarian musical royal has led a relatively sedate life, especially compared with high-flying contemporaries like Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. Perhaps thats why this New Orleans piano legends impact is often overlooked.Best known for classics including Aint That a Shame, Im Walkin and Blueberry Hill, Antoine Domino Jr., known as Fats, has put up staggering statistics: He has sold more than 60 million records and, between 1950 and 1963, he made Billboards pop chart 63 times and its R&B chart 59 times  more hit records than Mr. Berry, Little Richard and Buddy Holly combined.Yet he generally shied away from the spotlight. The planet missed out on certain things that Antoine was about, said the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Dr. John in a recent phone conversation. Hes the one who brought everything to fruition.Joe Lauro, a filmmaker and archivist, set out to address this gap with a new documentary he directed and produced, The Big Beat: Fats Domino and the Birth of Rock n Roll. The films broadcast premiere will be on the PBS American Masters series this Friday, Mr. Dominos 88th birthday. (A longer version of the documentary will be released as a DVD the same day.)Mr. Lauro, who has produced documentaries on the blues giant Howlin Wolf and on gospel music, said this project began about 10 years ago, when a woman approached him at the premiere of his film The Wildest!, about the hard-swinging big band musician Louis Prima, saying that she was a friend of Mr. Dominos and she wanted to introduce the two men.In a telephone interview, Mr. Lauro described entering the parallel universe of Mr. Dominos double-shotgun house in the Ninth Ward neighborhood of New Orleans where he grew up. Mr. Dominos first response when they met, Mr. Lauro recalled, was, I dont want to be documented by nobody! For five years, the producer would visit the singer and they would talk and listen to music.Still, the story faced some significant challenges. Mr. Domino, who has not performed since 2007, is painfully shy and very reluctant to speak in public. In addition, most of the performance footage that exists  clips from teen shows and early rock n roll movies  isnt particularly dynamic.But then Mr. Lauro unearthed a film of a complete 1962 concert by Mr. Domino and his original band at the Antibes Jazz Festival in France. That inspired me to get over the other hurdles, Mr. Lauro said. Everything I needed was in that concert  they lead a second line through the audience, theres great piano playing. Then I knew I needed to make the film. (Though he did record new interviews with Mr. Domino, most of the time that the singer is heard speaking came from an archive of conversations with the biographer Rick Coleman, who also appears in the film.)The Big Beat focuses on Mr. Dominos early years, in an area so poor it still had dirt roads, before he became entranced by the piano and eventually joined forces with the bandleader-arranger Dave Bartholomew. Together, they helped create rock n roll before it had a name; Mr. Dominos breakthrough hit, The Fat Man, was recorded in 1949 (five years before Presleys first recording session) and was just inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.Dave and Fats had the magnetism of opposites, Mr. Lauro said. Fats would come up with a simple melody, and Dave would give it an edge or write a bridge. Or Dave brought in a song like Blue Monday and Fats would give it a more accessible approach. The combination is where the magic is.Don Bartholomew, Daves son and a musician in New Orleans who has appeared in the HBO series Treme, said that although he grew up thinking of Mr. Domino as a family member, the movie helped him understand the relationship between the two men. That chemistry was just magical, like hand in glove, a perfect match, he said. It was a local sound my dad was producing, but Fats took it to the world.Though Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew (at age 95) are still alive, other luminaries who appear in The Big Beat  like the musician/songwriter Allen Toussaint and the producer Cosimo Matassa  died while the film was is production. When youre dealing with subjects in their 80s and 90s, you really dont want delays, Mr. Lauro said, stressing the urgency of capturing this history before its too late.Don Bartholomew underlined the importance of bringing Mr. Dominos story to light: He put New Orleans on the map, but even people in New Orleans today dont know who Fats Domino is, he said. Its been lost  nobody really knows what he did in terms of the music, the beginning of rock n roll, and breaking segregation.Dr. John, one of Fats Dominos greatest disciples, put it in more sweeping terms. He was always ahead of the times, and spiritually off the hook, he said. And when Antoine and Dave got together, they made this city reverberate."}
{"text": "A 17TH-CENTURY FARMHOUSE IN MALTA$2.17 MILLION (1.95 MILLION EUROS)This four-bedroom stone villa, with two full and three half baths, is in Attard, part of a cluster of old communities in central Malta known as The Three Villages. About a 10-minute drive from the medieval walled city of Mdina, one of Maltas biggest tourist attractions, Attard is home to San Anton Palace, the official residence of the president of Malta, and the surrounding San Anton public gardens.This three-story farmhouse was originally built in the 17th century. The current owners bought the parcel of nearly 0.25 acre and the house, then vacant and derelict, in 1994. They renovated every aspect of the home, adding modern elements while maintaining the original features.The house, with about 5,800 square feet of living area, is designed around a central courtyard, in a traditional Maltese style. The thick limestone walls and small exterior windows are also typical of old homes in the area. A hallway leads around the edges of the house, connecting the rooms. The main living areas are accented with stone arches. The floors are Maltese flagstone coated with honey-colored linseed oil.One of the living areas on the ground floor was originally used as the farms mill room, where livestock was housed and fed. This room features two distinctive stone arches and a log fireplace; two stone tie rings for animals remain from the original mill room.A short stone staircase in the old mill room leads to a long rectangular dining room that can seat 20. Another staircase leads to a loft with a parquet floor, which can be used for a gym or a living area. A doorway from the mill room leads to the kitchen, which is equipped with modern appliances and includes a small dining area.The ground floor also has a room currently used as a library and study, a TV room and two half-bathrooms. The loft, TV room and mill room have broad windows with views of the gardens. The furniture is not for sale, said Francis Spiteri Paris, the managing director of Perry Estate Agents, which is listing the property.The four bedrooms are upstairs, including a master bedroom overlooking the garden with an en-suite bathroom and a walk-in closet. Two bedrooms face the courtyard; another overlooks the road. One bedroom served as the farmhouses original living quarters, known as the l-ghorfa, the owner said. There are two terraces, one overlooking the garden and one overlooking the interior courtyard.The property features more than 5,000 square feet of garden, including a 36-foot pool, a lawn, a barbecue area and fruit trees. The property includes a one-car garage and a large carport at the end of the garden.The home is a short walk to markets, schools and small cafes. It is about a 20-minute drive to the port city of Valletta, Maltas capital, a Unesco World Heritage site. Malta International Airport is about a 15-minute drive from Attard.MARKET OVERVIEWMaltas business-friendly tax structure and sunny Mediterranean climate have attracted international property buyers for many years. Demand for homes often outpaces the limited supply on the island, which is only 121 square miles.There is a lot of foreign interest, Mr. Paris said. There has been a big surge in prices.Prices have been rising steadily by more than 10 percent annually for the past two years, agents say. Demand is particularly strong for traditional homes and newer homes in the countryside.Today it is a very mature market, said Ian Casolani, the managing director of Belair Property, a Malta real estate agency. Properties are becoming harder and harder to come by.In recent years there has been a wave of new construction, particularly in apartments along the coast. The new apartment developments are attracting more international investors, many looking to offer the property as a rental.The rental market has exploded, Mr. Casolani said.Malta is also benefiting from the Individual Investor Program inaugurated in 2014, which offers a path to Malta citizenship to investors willing to make a minimum contribution and investment totaling 1.15 million euros, or about $1.28 million, including buying or leasing property. That also means full European Union citizenship, since Malta is a member.In the first year of the program, Malta processed about 100 applications, according to Henley and Partners, the British-based group that helped to implement the program.WHO BUYS IN MALTAMalta has been a favorite of British second-home buyers for many years, but the island also attracts Scandinavians, Germans, French and other E.U. citizens, agents said.In recent years there has been an increase in buyers from Asia and the Middle East, according to Mr. Casolani, who estimates that 40 percent to 50 percent of his business comes from foreign buyers.BUYING BASICSMalta is a member of the European Union and follows many aspects of the British legal system, making buying property a relatively straightforward transaction, agents say. Documents and contracts are typically prepared in English. Escrow accounts are common to safeguard deposits, and titles are tracked by a public land registry.There are a few restrictions on foreign buyers, including a limit of one property per foreign owner, except in projects in Special Designated Areas (SDAs). In the SDAs, which are primarily mixed-use residential and commercial projects, foreigners typically have the same rights as Maltese citizens and can buy several properties.A notary typically oversees the transaction process, confirms ownership status and records all documents.WEBSITESMalta Tourism Authority site: visitmalta.comCity of Valletta site: cityofvalletta.orgMalta government information: gov.mtLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESMaltese and English; euro (1 euro = $1.11)TAXES AND FEESThere is a 5 percent stamp duty on home purchases. The notary typically charges a fee ranging from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent of the purchase price. There are no annual property taxes in Malta. The seller usually pays a fee of 5 percent to the agent handling the sale.While there is no tax on profit when a home is sold, the seller typically pays a tax of 5 percent to 8 percent of the sales price, depending on the type of property and length of ownership. But the seller may be exempt from the tax if he has used the property as a main residence for at least three consecutive years.CONTACTFrancis Spiteri Paris, Perry Estate Agents, (011-356) 2131 0800; perry.com.mt"}
{"text": "In a letter written in 1871, the Symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud uttered a phrase that announces the modern age: Je est un autre (I is someone else). Some 69 years later I entered the world as an identical twin, and Rimbauds claim has an uncanny truth for me, since I grew up being one of a pair. Even though our friends and family could easily tell us apart, most people could not, and I began life with a blurrier, more fluid sense of my contours than most other folks.My brother and I live in different cities, but I have never lost my conviction that ones outward form  the shape of people, but also of surfaces and things  may not be what it seems.That personal intuition is of a piece with my career as a professor of literature, since I am convinced that great works of art tell us about shape-shifting, about both the world and ourselves as more mobile, more misperceived, more dimensional beings, than science or our senses would have us believe.Enthusiasm for the Humanities, though, is much diminished in todays educational institutions. Our data-driven culture bears much of the blame: The arts can no longer compete with the prestige and financial payoffs promised by studying the STEM fields  a curriculum integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These are all worthy disciplines that offer precise information on practically everything. But, often and inadvertently, they distort our perceptions; they even shortchange us.The regime of information may well sport its specific truths, but it is locked out of the associations  subjective but also moral and philosophical  that bathe all literature. A new technology like GPS provides us with the most efficient and direct route to a destination, but it presupposes we know where we are going. Finding an address is one thing; finding ones way in life is another. Even our smartest computers or most brilliant statisticians are at a loss when it comes to mapping our psychic landscapes.When and how do you take your own measure? And what are you measuring? Both Oedipus and Lear could initially subscribe to Shakespeares notation, every inch a king, but by plays end, something different, varied and terrifying has come to light: for one, an unknown history of parricide and incest, for the other, an opening into a moral vision of such force that it wrecks all prior frames, leading to madness, as Lear suffers his kinship with all bare, forkd animal[s]. Lifes actual hurdy-gurdy often explodes our labels and preconceptions.How much do you know about Shakespeare, I once asked a friend who has committed much of her life to studying the Bard. She replied, Not as much as he knows about me. Remember this the next time someone tells you literature is useless.Why does this matter? The humanities interrogate us. They challenge our sense of who we are, even of who our brothers and sisters might be. When President Obama said of Trayvon Martin, this could have been my son, he was uttering a truth that goes beyond compassion and reaches toward recognition. It could have been me is the threshold for the vistas that literature and art make available to us.Art not only brings us news from the interior, but it points to future knowledge. A humanistic education is not about memorizing poems or knowing when X wrote Y, and what Z had to say about it. It is, instead, about the human record that is available to us in libraries and museums and theaters and, yes, online. But that record lives and breathes; it is not calculable or teachable via numbers or bullet points. Instead, it requires something that we never fail to do before buying clothes: Trying the garment on.Art and literature are tried on. Reading a book, seeing a painting or a play or a film: Such encounters are fueled by affect as well as intelligence. Much fleshing out happens here: We invest the art with our own feelings, but the art comes to live inside us, adding to our own repertoire. Art obliges us to first-personalize the world. Our commerce with art makes us fellow travelers: to other cultures, other values, other selves. Some may think this both narcissistic and nave, but ask yourself: What other means of propulsion can yield such encounters?This humanistic model is sloppy. It has no bottom line. It is not geared for maximum productivity. It will not increase your arsenal of facts or data. But it rivals with rockets when it comes to flight and the visions it enables. And it will help create denser and more generous lives, lives aware that others are not only other, but are real. In this regard, it adds depth and resonance to what I regard as the shadowy, impalpable world of numbers and data: empirical notations that have no interest nor purchase in interiority, in values; notations that offer the heart no foothold.The world of information is more Gothic than its believers believe, because it is ghostly, silhouette-like, deprived of human sentience. If we actually believe that the project of education is to enrich our students lives, then I submit that the Humanities are on the right side of the aisle, whatever paychecks they do or do not deliver.At a time when the price of a degree from elite institutions is well over six figures, fields such as literature and the arts may seem like a luxury item. But we may have it backwards. They are, to cite Hemingways title for his Paris memoir, a moveable feast, and they offer us a kind of reach into time and space that we can find nowhere else.We enter the bookstore, see the many volumes arrayed there, and think: so much to read, so little time. But books do not take time; they give time, they expand our resources of both heart and mind. It may sound paradoxical, but they are, in the last analysis, scientific, for they trace the far-flung route by which we come to understand our world and ourselves. They take our measure. And we are never through discovering who we are.Arnold Weinstein is a professor of comparative literature at Brown University, and the author, most recently, of Morning, Noon and Night: Finding the Meaning of Lifes Stages."}
{"text": "The New York Times announced on Tuesday that it had chosen three journalists to spend two years in its newsroom as part of a fellowship named for the  media columnist David Carr.The Times had initially said it would select just one person for the fellowship, which was created after Mr. Carrs death in 2015. Instead, John Herrman, a co-editor and media reporter for The Awl; Amanda Hess, a staff writer at Slate; and Greg Howard, a reporter for Deadspin, will all join the Times newsroom on March 15.The three were chosen from more than 600 applicants, from countries all over the world, by a panel of Times editors.We found these three candidates so compelling that we decided to select all of them, said Dean Baquet, The Timess executive editor. They are thoughtful, deep reporters. We will learn as much from them as they will from us.Mr. Herrman, 28, known for his long essays about the Internet and technology, will work with The Timess media group and write primarily for the Business section. Ms. Hess, 30, who covers the human side of web culture for Slate, will join the Culture section. And Mr. Howard, 27, who has written about race and sports at Deadspin since 2013, will work with The New York Times Magazine and other sections.The Times created the fellowship to honor Mr. Carr, who was known for a writing style that was both plain-spoken and elegant. In his weekly  Media Equation column, he displayed his passion for chronicling the ways in which technology was affecting the media industry and culture at large.He began his career with alternative weekly newspapers and joined The Times in 2002 as a reporter. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2015. He also wrote a memoir, The Night of the Gun, which chronicled his battles with addiction, and he was a star of the documentary Page One: Inside The New York Times, about The Times.He was also a mentor to many young journalists at The Times and other organizations. He could often be seen standing outside The Timess 40th Street entrance, engaged in deep conversation with someone seeking his counsel. In 2014 he began teaching a course at Boston Universitys College of Communication.In the spirit of Davids curiosity, his ability to see around the corner, and his preference to show rather than tell, I can say with certainty that he would have made these choices himself, said Jill Rooney Carr, Mr. Carrs widow.On behalf of the Carr family, we congratulate Amanda, Greg and John and cant wait to see their work on the written page, on the screen or in a nascent medium thats yet to be explained."}

{"text": "People see sharks as predators, not prey. Admit it, even in 2016, you can still hum the Jaws theme in your head. Yet according to the Italian photographer Federico Vespignani, the global shark population has plummeted 80 percent because of overfishing.Last year, Mr. Vespignani spent time in Baja, Mexico, among the shark fishermen  Tiburoneros  whose daily catch is exported to Asian markets, as well as sold locally as cheap, generic fillets. The result was a magnificent series of photographs, Facing the Blue. With their moody light and up-close depictions of sharks, the photographs draw us in, upending our expectations, challenging our fears and engendering empathy for these fearsome beasts.Mr. Vespignani, 27, grew up in Venice, a city of water, but his natural rebellious streak drew him to land. He became interested in graffiti, and skateboarding, which is apparently outlawed in the tourist mecca.In Venice, its illegal to have wheels in the city, he said, in a recent interview. You can walk only by foot. If the police catch you skating, theyd bring your skateboard with them.He used a little pocket camera to document the tricks his friends tried and the tags they sprayed. He didnt get serious about photography until his grandfather, a Communist writer, gave him a copy of a Robert Capa photography book, hoping to inspire a new level of seriousness. The gambit worked, and Mr. Vespignani went on to study art in Rome, before embarking on his career as a professional photographer in Milan.Mr. Vespignani now uses photography to conquer his fears, and to search for social and environmental projects that bring him in contact with challenging subjects. He has documented fishermen in Spain, homophobia in Italy and the often-besieged L.G.B.T. community in Jamaica.He became interested in shark fishing after hearing about the precipitous decline in shark populations. He read about a group of shark fishermen in Baja who were trying to take tourists out to swim with the sharks, and was intrigued by the contradiction. Like most people, he was also very afraid of sharks.I always had a big fascination for sharks, he said. They scare me a lot. I also like the relationship that can be between the man and the sea.(When asked the obvious question as to whether he read, and enjoyed, The Old Man and the Sea, the Ernest Hemingway classic, he said merely, Of course.)He self-funded a trip to the Baja California peninsula in 2015, to better understand the intricate realities behind shark fishing. He had arranged to meet up with representatives from Pelagic Life, a Mexico City-based nongovernmental organization, curious about its attempt to build a tourist market for swimming with sharks. (The effort is apparently not succeeding, as the fishermen are skeptical of conservationist efforts.)When the Pelagic Life representatives were delayed, Mr. Vespignani found himself alone in the village of Puerto San Carlos and tried to persuade the members of the fishing community to drop their guard and let him photograph their work. They were particularly suspicious, believing he might be a government agent, as there had been reports that Mexico had considered banning shark fishing.I started talking with all of the people in the village, which is very small, he said. They were more confident when the days passed. I also ate with them. My ticket for entering the island was 25 Tecate lights.Mr. Vespignani was invited to visit the shark fishermens camp on Cabo San Lazaro, a small island off the Pacific Coast, two hours away by boat. When he arrived, he discovered the spartan conditions in which the fishermen lived while they were away from their permanent home village, El Sargento.On this island, there is absolutely nothing. Just coyotes and vultures, he said. No electricity. No water. Just a couple of barracks, and seven crews of fishermen. Two guys per boat.If his goal was to confront his fears and chase danger, the little Mexican island obliged, as he faced poisonous black widow spiders and a hungry pack of coyotes before he even got into the sea.Its very dangerous job, because you are fishing shark up to 30 miles from the coast, he said. You are in the open ocean. Everything can go wrong. Moreover, that kind of boat is very small. Only six meters. They have just one alarm system that is a kind of GPS, but it doesnt work.Mr. Vespignani shot for eight days alongside the fishermen, sometimes in 12-foot waves. He even helped haul sharks into the boat after one of the crew was injured. He learned that the fishermen do it for love and camaraderie, but mostly for a lack of choice, as the sharks were overfished in the calmer Sea of Cortes, where El Sargento is.If these fishermen cant fish shark, they dont know what to do, he said. Down there in Baja California, there are really no jobs. All you have to do is fishing, or maybe you have to become a narco.Although he risked much to get his photographs, Mr. Vespignani doesnt really believe that photography can change things by itself. He wants to use his work to create dialogue and draw attention to the messy reality of environmental concerns.Nowadays, the fish in the sea are disappearing, he said. For some people right now, there are no alternatives, so they are continuing to fish, because they dont know how to get economical benefits from other resources.That said, he did report that shark fins, long coveted in parts of Asia, were now less expensive, the trade no longer flourishing, because of the results of conservation and criminalization.I am not against the fishermen, he said. I just want to raise some questions about this relationship. The conservationist approach is a kind of aristocratic idea, when the reality is different, and a lot more complicated.Jonathan Blaustein is an artist and writer based in New Mexico.

{"text": "HONG KONG  The theft of dogs, often to be resold as meat, is a sad reality for people with pets in China. But the theft of one 7-year-old black Labrador in Beijing on Monday has provoked an unusual outcry.The dog, Qiaoqiao, is no average pet. She was trained as a guide dog and has spent the past six years as a companion to Tian Fengbo, a 47-year-old blind man who lives in a village on the outskirts of the Chinese capital.Mr. Tian has worked as a masseur, a common occupation for blind people in China, and now operates a massage parlor chain. He had left Qiaoqiao at one of his outlets overnight. An assistant was walking the dog Monday morning when men in a gray van stole her. Neighbors told The Beijing Morning News that the village had had a rash of dog thefts in recent days.Mr. Tian said he had barely eaten or slept since his companion was taken.I lost my sight in an accident and have been through many difficulties. But now that Qiaoqiao is gone, I feel like there is something very heavy blocking my chest, Mr. Tian said. Qiaoqiao always accompanied me. She was like a friend to me. Now I feel like Ive lost a close friend.He said he remained optimistic that the police would find the dog, since security cameras in his village had recorded the van that carried Qiaoqiao away. The license plate was from neighboring Hebei Province, although he said the number was unclear.Qiaoqiao is one of about 10 registered guide dogs in Beijing, a city of more than 20 million, and one of about 100 in the entire country, according to officials at Chinas main guide-dog training center in the coastal city of Dalian.The lack of service animals is part of Chinas mixed record of improving the lives of its disabled citizens. The country has made progress in some ways. For many years, the leader of the China Disabled Persons Federation was the son of Deng Xiaoping, Deng Pufang, who was paralyzed after being thrown from a building during the Cultural Revolution. He brought a new focus to long-overlooked needs.But advocates say many barriers persist. Disabled people face discrimination in education and employment, and Chinese cities are far from fully accessible. Some aids are obvious, like the textured paving strips for visually impaired people that line most sidewalks in major cities. But many buildings still lack wheelchair ramps, and guide dogs are often unwelcome in public places.Disability advocates saw the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing as a breakthrough. As with the Summer Olympics that preceded it, China went to great lengths to prepare for the event. Street-level pedestrian crossings were built to offer alternatives to underpasses with lengthy stairways. The Forbidden City underwent expensive renovations to allow wheelchair access. And service animals were given a rare moment of attention after Ping Yali, a blind long-jumper and Chinas first Paralympic gold medalist, carried the torch into the opening ceremony alongside her guide dog, Lucky.Lucky was Beijings first guide dog, and Ms. Ping was a vocal advocate. She spoke of the barriers she experienced in Beijing, where large dogs are banned in the city center. The police made an exception for Lucky in 2007 but allowed Ms. Ping to go out with the dog only if she were accompanied by a sighted person.China enacted a law to permit guide dogs in public places in 2012, but its enforcement has been spotty. In 2013, Liu Hongquan, a blind singer who was scheduled to perform at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, was barred from entering the campus with his guide dog.Liang Jia, who works at the Dalian China Guide Dog Training Center, said that acceptance of the dogs had grown in recent years. In addition to the 100 dogs now working around the country, the center is training 80 more, with 20 puppies expected to soon join them.For now the centers focus is on one alumna, Ms. Liang said. Qiaoqiaos former trainers fear that she might be killed. At the very least, she will suffer from being separated from Mr. Tian.She will definitely be anxious, Ms. Liang said. Guide dogs are different from ordinary dogs. They are with their owners almost 24-7, so they have a deeper attachment."}
{"text": "No, folks, Im not retracting any of my it wont be Trump predictions just yet, but in the interest of staying au courant with my fellow pundits in the wake of last nights Nevada steamrolling lets stroll for a moment in a world where Donald Trump actually wins the nomination. Michael Brendan Dougherty hasa good columnon all the ways that this would be a disaster for theconservative movement  how it would weaken the influence of conservatisms major institutions (by exposing how inessential their ideas and imprimatur are to actually winning power in the G.O.P.), how it would turn the rights personnel and policy minds against one another (some would throw in with Team Trump, others wouldnt, and the recriminations would be vicious), and how it would create a particular crisis for the pro-life movement, because Trumps conversion on the issue is far less convincing than those of previous nominees like Mitt Romney or George H.W. Bush, and one way or another his nomination would probablyguarantee that genuinelyanti-Roe justices would be reduced to a tiny rump on a consolidated, progressive Supreme Court.All of this seems wise, particularly the last point. Theres a lot of interesting commentary on how and why Trump is doing so well with evangelicals (see Ben Domenech for one theory, J.D. Vance for another), but the reality is that frequent church attendees still arent his strongest demographic, and many of the core figures (especially the younger core figures) in religious and social conservatism at best mistrust and at worst despise him. More, the pro-life movements Catholic wing includes a real cohort that reallyonly tilts Republican because of the abortion issue, and that would at some level be happy to have a reason not to pull the lever for the Republican nominee. (I suspect there are quite a few young pro-life Catholics who would vote for Marco Rubio over Hillary Clinton but Bernie Sanders over Trump; in a Trump-Hillary race Im not sure what theyd do.) How much any of this would matter to the elections final outcome I have no idea, but it would certainlyleave religious conservatives, perhaps more than other factions on the right, in a state of Trump-wrought civil war.Having agreed with Dougherty this far, though, I think he overstates how devastating a Trump nomination would be to the G.O.P.s ability to reconstitute itself as a coherent force in 2020 or 2024:Even thoughI have wantedto see the GOP address the voters that Trump is courting with more substantial policies, I have serious doubts about whether the Republican coalition can so easily be re-assembled under Trump or after him. The one truly great thing about American political parties is that they are so big that their members must accommodate each other and moderate their demands and appetites. For too long, an elite financial wing of the Republican Party got immoderate about its demands, and the party caved to them. Trump is the understandable immoderate counter-reaction. Who or what can possibly reconcile these factions to one another?Well, the reality of a Hillary Clinton presidency and leftward-shifting Democratic Party might help! The fact is that parties do tend to reconstitute themselves after major internal crises. Barry Goldwater seemed like hed split the G.O.P. disastrously and reduced it to a permanent minority, but four years later Nixon won the presidency. Then Watergate threatened to leave the Republicans as a rump yet again, but six years later Reaganism was ascendant. Theres no reason to assume that the right leader, the Nixon or Reagan to Trumps Wallace or Goldwater, couldnt pull of something similar after four or eight years of Hillary  especially since, as Dougherty writes, the Trump revolt has finally exposed the G.O.P.s core problem, the disconnect between its elite financial wing and its actual voting base, in ways that no Panglossian, RNC-autopsy,all is well if we just pass immigration reformanalysis can now deny.And more than that: What Trump has demonstrated, is demonstrating, is that if the Republican Party doesnt address its working class constituencys entirely-legitimate doubts about its economic and (to a lesser extent) foreign policy, it will have to live with the permanent threat of a kind of white-identity-politics insurgency. This was already hinted at in the era of the Tea Party, but then Republican elites could fool themselves that the Tea Party was just all about limited government; now the reality is laid bare.So in a post-Trump-as-nominee landscape Republicans will face a pretty clear choice: Either continue to ride the tiger, or try to actually craft an agenda that might appeal pan-ethnically, to middle-class Hispanics and blacks as well as Rust Belt whites. And for all that I make mock ofthe partys donors and consultants, at bottom Im confident they dont want Trumpism, they dont want to work for a trending-toward-ethno-nationalismparty, they dont want to go through this agony every four or eight years. So I think there willbe some real impetus, in the wake of a Donald-wrought degringolade, to actuallytrysome new things things that might not work, yes, but if they did work could actually succeed in bringing a better Republican Party out of the Trumpian wreckage.Which is the bright side of Trump; its really there, for those with eyes to see. (Always look on the bright side of liiiiife )But is it bright enough to make Trumps nomination something to be actually accepted or desired? Are better odds for reform conservatism worth a choice between four or eight years with President Hillaryor our own nuclear-armed Berlusconi?As much as I like my family-friendly tax policy, my wage subsidies and relocation vouchers and health insurance tax credits and skills-based immigration policy and oh so much more  the answer is still no."}
{"text": "Of all the do-it-yourself projects I wanted to try, homemade yogurt was not at the top of the list. After all, its a lot easier to find a decent yogurt on the market than it is to track down, say, preserved lemons or cabbage-free kimchi.But then I fell in love with a whole-milk yogurt that was so smooth, thick and milky tasting that it blew away anything Id had before. Naturally, it was made by a Brooklyn artisan, it cost a fortune, and it was in such high demand that the fancy shop where it was sold was often out of stock.So I decided to try making my own. If I used the expensive yogurt as a starter, maybe I could approximate that beloved flavor for a fraction of what I was paying. And Id never have to worry about running out.The Internet has plenty of yogurt how-tos, but I found the most accessible and complete guide in a book called Yogurt Culture, by Cheryl Sternman Rule, published last year.Her book made homemade yogurt seem not only easy, but also kind of essential. She persuaded me that making my own yogurt was one of those techniques that, like baking bread, every passionate cook should try at least once  if for nothing more than to connect with an ancient tradition.Yogurt making turned out to be so simple that its become part of my weekly routine. I can throw together a batch in the morning while Im drinking my tea, and its ready that same night. All I do is heat a pot of milk until it steams, let it cool down a bit, and stir in some yogurt to act as a starter. Then I leave the pot in a warm place to ferment.Thats it.During fermentation, the milk thickens into something delectably custardy and satiny smooth, with a clean, fresh, tangy flavor that is even better than the fancy artisanal stuff  a pretty big payoff for what ends up being about 10 minutes of active work.After several months of yogurt making, I have learned a few little tricks to make the process go seamlessly.The first, from Ms. Sternman Rules website teamyogurt.com, is to rub an ice cube over the inside bottom of the pot before adding the milk. This keeps it from scorching as it heats.Next is that where the pot of milk ferments doesnt really matter as long as its warm. Ive tried placing it in a turned-off oven with the oven light on, in a corner swathed in a heating pad, on the countertop wrapped in a big towel, and tucked on the top of the fridge. They all worked, though the warmer the spot, the more quickly the milk fermented.Once the yogurt thickens and you think it may be ready, taste it before you stick it into the refrigerator. If it seems too mild, let it sit out for another couple of hours to increase the tanginess. You can leave it for up to 24 hours at room temperature if need be without worrying about spoiling.You can use your homemade yogurt as the starter for the next few batches, but it can weaken over time and lose its thickening power. As a precaution, Ive been buying new yogurt for every five batches. (Any brand of plain yogurt will do as long as you like the taste of it.) This may be overkill, but Im addicted enough at this point to want be sure of the outcome rather than do without yogurt for breakfast.And by making my own, Im guaranteed to have a steady supply of the good stuff.Recipes: Creamy Homemade Yogurt | Granolas"}
{"text": "State governments are at the front lines of the countrys epidemic of drug overdose deaths. Thats why it is important that the National Governors Association says it will come up with  protocols for dispensing prescription painkillers that are among the biggest sources of addiction and abuse in the country.The protocols, or guidelines, would restrict how and under what circumstances doctors could prescribe a category of pain drugs known as opioids. They might, for example, impose limits on how many pills doctors could prescribe to patients who have had minor surgery or dental procedures.More than 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2014; 61 percent of those deaths involved opioids like the prescription drug oxycodone, and illegal substances like heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of drug overdose deaths has increased by 140 percent since 2000, while prescriptions for opioid painkillers have quadrupled in roughly the same period. Experts say many patients who become addicted go on to use heroin and other illegal opioids.The governors associations health and human services committee is expected to present the protocols at a meeting in July. Legislators and governors in each state could then adopt those standards into their laws and regulations, which would make meaningful enforcement against excessive prescriptions more likely. Some leaders intend to act even sooner. The governors of New England states like Vermont and Massachusetts say they will work together to come up with common prescribing guidelines for their states within a few weeks.Done right, the guidelines  being developed with medical specialists, government regulators, insurance companies and other experts  should reduce the number of excessive prescriptions. Similar efforts by some states and insurance companies have shown promising results. Florida, for example, reduced its prescription drug overdose death rate by 23 percent between 2010 and 2012 after it strengthened its prescribing laws and increased enforcement against doctors who dispensed too many pills, often because it was financially lucrative. And Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts has reduced opioid use by, among other things, requiring some patients to use just one pharmacy to fill their prescriptions.On the federal front, the C.D.C. is expected to publish voluntary guidelines soon for doctors in treating chronic pain in adults. And Congress is considering a bill that would require the secretary of health and human services to convene a task force to develop best practices for prescribing painkillers.Drug companies and some doctors will push back against any limits on prescriptions enacted by state lawmakers. The American Medical Association says the decision to prescribe drugs should stay in the hands of physicians. Of course, doctors should have discretion to make medical decisions, including what drugs to use, but state governments also have a duty to protect people by placing sensible limits on the use of risky substances.Obviously, reducing the number of opioid prescriptions only addresses part of the addiction problem. Earlier this month, President Obama proposed spending $1.1 billion on treatment and prevention programs. And Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, has proposed $600 million in emergency funding to address the opioid crisis. These requests are surely reasonable, given the size of the national problem."}
{"text": "For Miuccia Prada, the mens show was a preview to what she was feeling for womens wear, said the hairstylist Guido Palau backstage in the hours before Pradas womens collection. And Miuccia wanted to continue the same look we created for the women in Januarys show.That look is romantic in a way that is typical of Prada  with a profoundly red lip and classically curled hair, but all a little bit off-kilter. Its the sort of hairstyle that was a great do at one time but now its worn in, Palau said. Along with his team, the hairstylist went through long steps of shaping the hair into undulating, face-framing waves  and then they destroyed it. If you keep hair looking rich and shiny, it looks rich and wrong for Prada, he said.The hairstylist loaded on Redken Wax Blast and Hairspray 23 until hair became dull and rigid. Make sure shes hard! he commanded over a models head backstage. We do all the bad things you should never do to good hair, but thats what makes it look modern, he said. It looks like maybe shes ravaged, or maybe shes come off of a boat where there was a bad storm.That storm-battered hairstyle was complemented by a look that make-up artist Pat McGrath described as very strong  for a woman bold enough to wear this kind of lip. McGrath layered lips with foundation, concealer and powder. She then added three shades of red lipstick in orange- and blue-based tones to create a complex color. Miuccia Pradas idea of beauty is always very appealing, Palau said of the overall look. I think women are attracted to how theyre represented here  its powerful, and slightly kinky in a way, but theres something about it being slightly off that makes it captivating."}
{"text": "Were Brakes Just Put on the Trump Juggernaut?Something profound happened on the stage in Houston on Thursday night. Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz stopped focusing on each other long enough to turn toward the person who is actually beating both of them and at this point favored to win the Republican nomination: Donald Trump.Cruz dismissed Trump as someone whod discovered certain concerns  whod discovered conservatism, really  only when he became a candidate. Cruz said that while he was working to combat the illegal immigration that so inflames Trump now, Where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice.But Rubio turned in Trumps direction with particular force. With ferociousness, in fact. He recited a meticulously memorized litany of Trumps transgressions, especially those that contradict Trumps words now: the illegal immigrants that Trump reportedly hired for his construction projects, the litigation against a college bearing his name, multiple bankruptcies associated with him.Referring to Trumps promised barrier along the Mexican border, Rubio sniped: If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, hell be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.He went after the notion that Trump is a good businessman. He went after the idea that Trump is a straight talker. He called Trump a liar  repeatedly.In other words, he finally hit Trump where Trump lives: image-wise. This had to happen, because one explanation for Trumps success is how reluctant his adversaries have been to confront him as they quarreled with one another instead.And this had to hurt Trump, because he was shown in a harsher light than hed been shown in at any previous debate, and his face reddened in the glare.But Thursday night may well have been too late, and Trump has been made to mimic a ripe tomato before  with minimal political damage to him.Besides which, Trump at times pushed back as effectively as possible, brushing off charges of hypocrisy and painting Rubio as a pipsqueak with no knowledge of business, and Cruz as an obnoxious scold despised by his Senate colleagues. Those were the smart colors to apply to them.Did Rubio Go Too Far?Almost each of his attacks on Trump made good sense. All were entirely fair. But as they piled up higher than even the most majestic Trump-envisioned border wall could ever reach, he came across as strident, mocking, condescending, bratty.And it was impossible not to wonder if he was doing precisely what Chris Christie had when he tried to take Rubio down in the debate just before the New Hampshire primary: bloodying his adversary at a cost of seriously wounding himself.He talked over Trump. Trump talked over him. He talked louder over Trump. Trump talked even louder over him. There was one extended exchange, with each of them accusing the other of being more robotic and programmed, that will live on in highlight reels forevermore.Now hes repeating himself, Rubio pointed out, referring to Trump.I dont repeat myself, said Trump.You dont repeat yourself, Rubio responded  disbelievingly, facetiously.And so it went. Rubios hectoring melody overlapped Trumps exasperated harmony.But when music gets that ugly, everyone involved can wind up sounding equally bad. And the flip side of Rubios  and Cruzs  assertiveness was desperation. They were both on the offensive on Thursday night because they were both on the ropes. Some viewers undoubtedly perceived it that way.Whats more, Rubio undercut his considerable efforts so far to be  and to label himself as  the candidate of optimism, uplift, positivity. He took another risk as well. He incurred Trumps wrath, and while Trump has savaged Cruz and Jeb Bush during this campaign, he hasnt vilified Rubio to the same extent.Tomorrow and the next day and the day after that, he will.How Much Does the Vagueness of Trumps Proposals Matter?It was predictable that Rubio and Cruz would portray Trump as someone whose campaign contributions over time, comments from yesteryear and herky-jerky swerves in the present all call into question how committed and trustworthy a conservative he is.But they lavished nearly as much energy on revealing Trump as an empty suit  as someone who cannot provide any policy details because he doesnt have any detailed policies. They asked for those details. Again and again. He responded with insults and boasts.The moderators pressed him for those details. He responded with boasts and insults. And at one cringe-inducing moment, he batted away a question from Hugh Hewitt by saying: Very few people listen to your radio show.Trump never got around to explaining how his health care plan would keep people from dying in the streets without committing the government to significantly increased spending. He never got around to explaining much of anything.And in the context of that void  and of Rubios imitation of a typical Trump answer  his most shopworn, banal phrases stood out.Were going to win a lot, Trump said, for the millionth time.Believe me, he said, for the trillionth. Those two evasive words sounded smaller and sillier than ever.Should Someone Have Organized a Search Party for Ben Carson and John Kasich?The lack of time given to these two was absolutely criminal.Granted, Kasich has only a prayer of going on to win the Republican nomination. And Carson doesnt even have that much.But they showed up. There were five candidates on that stage, not three. And fair is fair.Besides which, Kasich, when he did get to speak, was a typically welcome relief from the fractiousness and the I-loved-Antonin-Scalia-even-more-than-you-did happening to his side.In his oratory and proposals, hes the least divisive of the remaining Republican presidential aspirants. Hes also the closest to the center and, because of that, might be the fiercest adversary for any Democratic nominee.But he was elbowed out of a debate format and debate rules that gave extra time to anyone who was attacked, meaning more and more words for and from Trump, Rubio and Cruz.Carson perfectly captured this dynamic by blurting out: Can somebody attack me please?Do Trump, Rubio and Cruz Have a Future as 1960s-Style Girl Group?I previously mentioned the interweaving voices of Trump and Rubio. Toward the end of the debate, these candidates did a reprise, and Cruz also stormed into the song, so that all three of them spoke at the same time and formed a clangorous chorus.As that chorus continued and its volume rose, CNNs camera pulled back far enough to show the men standing there side by side, in almost identical dress. I couldnt help thinking that they were performing an audition or a concert  that they were some modern, male, unendurable antonym to Diana Ross and the Supremes.In Houston for one night only, ladies and gentlemen! Donald Trump and the Extremes."}

{"text": "The works in Mark Wallingers new exhibition at Hauser & Wirth in London, ID, span a range of methods, from the prehistoric to the very recent. For an evocative series of huge, black-and-white finger-painted iD works, Wallinger cites precedent as far back as the earliest rock art. On the newer end of the technological spectrum, several films and photographs in the show were shot on an iPhone, a tool that appeals to the artist for its ubiquity and the texture of its footage: for conveying contemporary experience, he says, its the most appropriate tool.In his mid-50s, dressed in a soft charcoal jacket and inky blue shirt, Wallinger has the loquacious demeanor of a rebel professor. His anti-elitist tendencies have seen him engage with the British public on its own territory, with works that have included a vulnerable marble figure with a crown of thorns on the fourth plinth in Londons Trafalgar Square (Ecce Homo, 1999) and a series of 270 labyrinth paintings, one commissioned for every station on the London Underground (Labyrinth, 2013).The new exhibition opens with the bathetic Ego: photographs of the artists hands posed in echo of Michelangelos Creation of Adam, here printed onto two sheets of cheap, rumpled paper, and stuck to the wall with Blu-Tack. Wallingers focus on his hands  the tools of my trade, as he puts it  is a fitting entry into an exhibition that explores the human understanding of self.The dimensions of the iD paintings relate to Wallingers body  6 by 12 feet, as wide as the span of his arms and twice as high  but were also made possible, in a rather Darwinian way, he says, by his move to a new, high-ceilinged studio. Recalling Rorschach inkblot tests and preschool butterfly pictures, the black sweeps and whorls of the paintings are heavy with emotional significance. You think of working with the hand as quite crude, explains the artist, who creates each work with both arms simultaneously, working in roughly symmetrical movements, then flipping the canvas 180 degrees halfway through. But you can do a lot more with it and take a mark a lot further than you can with a loaded brush.Intended as an experiment in self-portraiture with a knowing nod to Abstract Expressionism, Wallinger now sees the works as diaristic, admitting that he had to get himself quite psyched up for each one. Ive had a terrible year or two, and these were quite essential to my being when they started off, he says. In an old-fashioned way, they were existentially essential to me. They became quite addictive to do.Following a series of more-or-less dizzying works, including the coolly omniscient Superego, a mirrored scale model of the rotating sign outside the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police, the show concludes with the new video piece Orrery. It takes its name from early mechanical models of the solar system  objects that powerfully disabused humanity of its central role in the universe  and here, Wallinger turns his gaze to the banal, again with the help of an iPhone and Blu-Tack. Filmed from his car window as he circumnavigates a municipal roundabout near his childhood home, its four screens portray a commemorative oak tree planted 65 years ago during the festival of Britain, shot over 360 degrees and four seasons. I quite like it as a little cameo of England, he says, an island with an oak tree."}
{"text": "Its hard to envision Brooklyn-born Bernie Sanders with an Australian accent. Instead of yelling the Aussie chant that ends with oi! oi! oi! he might just say oy. But there are reasons he might feel at home in Australia.College is free at the point of entry. Taxes on the wealthy are higher, and the safety net is stronger.Australia has something else that would probably benefit Mr. Sanders: compulsory voting, in which youre expected to show up to a voting place and may be fined if you dont.As my colleague Nate Cohn has reported this month during the early Democratic primary contests, Mr. Sanders is doing well with working-class white voters, and Hillary Clinton is doing well with wealthier ones. But thats not necessarily an even swap for Mr. Sanders: The wealthy vote at a higher rate than the poor. The opportunity (and the challenge) for Mr. Sanders is turning out an untapped population of voters. As he has said, If theres a large voter turnout, were going to win.What is the relationship between wealth and voting preference?Its not nearly as predictive as race and religion.Plenty of affluent city dwellers are liberal, for example. But its generally true that as incomes rise, people are more likely to vote for a Republican in a presidential election, as the 2012 exit polls show.According to entrance polls in Iowa this month, Mrs. Clinton won by 55 percent to 37 percent among voters with household income of more than $100,000 per year, and Mr. Sanders won, 57-41, among those with less than $30,000.A reader, EJS of Granite City, Ill., wrote:PHW of New York said:How big is the difference in voting rate among the rich and poor?Its stark at the very top. One study found that around 99 percent of the top 1 percent voted in 2008, compared with 49 percent of the people making less than $10,000. And according to 2010 census data and 2012 exit poll numbers ... About 50 percent of households made less than $50,000 a year, but that group punched below its weight, representing only 41 percent of the turnout in the election in 2012. About 20 percent made more than $100,000 a year, but that share of the 2012 turnout was 28 percent.Low participation among the poor contributed to a dismal voting rate of less than 37 percent in the 2014 midterm elections.Would our policies be different if there were compulsory voting?Recent research has shown significant differences between voters and nonvoters.Before the 2012 election, a Pew study found a strong preference for President Obama over Mr. Romney among nonvoters: 59 percent support for Mr. Obama versus 24 percent for Mr. Romney. The study also found that nonvoters expressed a greater appetite for progressive taxation and a bigger role for government. In other words, these are Mr. Sanderss people, and the playing field would be expected to tilt to the left.In a study last year titled Does Compulsory Voting Increase Support for Leftist Policy? Michael Bechtel, Dominik Hangartner and Lukas Schmid essentially answered their question with yes. Explaining their research into federal referendums in Switzerland in the first half of the 20th century for The Washington Posts Monkey Cage, they wrote, We find that higher turnout caused stronger support for leftist, redistributive policy, for example, bills that proposed stricter market regulation and expanded welfare programs.President Obama spoke publicly about compulsory voting for the first time in March, supporting it but later saying it wasnt a specific proposal.It would be transformative if everybody voted  that would counteract money more than anything, he said, referring to the influence of big donors. The people who tend not to vote are young, theyre lower-income, theyre skewed more heavily towards immigrant groups and minority groups. Theres a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls.In a paper for the Brookings Institution, William Galston and E. J. Dionne said of Australias voting transition a century ago:The results were remarkable. In the 1925 election, the first held under the new law, turnout soared to 91 percent. In the 27 elections since World War II, turnout in Australia has averaged 95 percent.They wrote, Universal voting would help fill the vacuum in participation by evening out disparities stemming from income, education and age.What are the chances of compulsory voting taking hold in the United States?Not good. Republicans are solidly opposed. And Democrats might feel the same way if they believed it would hurt their electoral chances.There are other considerations. Should people be forced to vote if they dont want to? What about the freedom not to vote?Australia is among the countries where you can be fined for not participating.In a YouGov survey last year, only 26 percent of American respondents supported mandatory voting, and that feeling hasnt changed much over the decades.Some argue that mandatory voting would even be unconstitutional.Australians are used to the system, but not all of them love it. Maybe American campaigns would have to be even less high-minded by tailoring pitches to voters who arent necessarily paying attention to substantive issues. Some of Mr. Sanderss strong support from blue-collar whites could push the discussion to the left, but the same demographic is also a big source of support for Donald Trump, who said, somewhat awkwardly, after his victory in the Nevada caucus on Tuesday, I love the poorly educated! Why so pessimistic? Nicholas Stephanopoulos, writing for The Atlantic, says compulsory voting actually has a viable path to enactment  you just have to think local first: The trick is to harness the partisanship that runs through U.S. politics, and to exploit the systems multiple levels of government. First Democrats and then Republicans, first at the local and then at the state or federal level, could be induced to support the policy.Mr. Galston and Mr. Dionne, who see compulsory voting partly as a salve for what ails our polarized politics, also offered what are probably more realistic options for increasing turnout, like automatic registration upon turning 18, same-day registration and a national holiday for voting. Last year, Mr. Sanders introduced a bill in the Senate that would create such a holiday.But Republicans havent typically embraced measures to make voting easier. (John Oliver put it less diplomatically last week.)It may be as tough for the American public to swallow as Vegemite, but Mr. Sanders or a leftist candidate like him may need structural changes in voting to get from oy to oi!A question for readers: Youve made it to the end (and past the puns). Do you favor compulsory voting?"}
{"text": "Baumols cost disease is a phenomenon that economists sometimes cite when they want to underscore the unequal effects of technological change. William Baumol, the New York University economist for whom the concept is named, uses a classical string quartet as his paradigmatic example. As he points out, no matter how fast our computers become or how many people worldwide plug into broadband-Internet access, it will still take roughly 30 minutes for four human beings to play Mozarts String Quartet No. 14. If your business is playing string quartets for live audiences, theres a fundamental limit to how much more productive, in raw economic terms, your work can become.Or  to take an example in which many more livelihoods are at stake  consider office cleaning. In the future, there might be new solvents, new cleaners, better scheduling software. But at the end of the day (usually literally), someone will still have to run a vacuum over a rug, run a rag over a table, empty smaller trash cans into bigger ones. Because of this, its almost simple logic that the only ways for an office-cleaning company to make more money will always stay the same: charge clients more or pay workers less. In a big city, filled with competitive office-cleaning companies and a seemingly endless supply of desperate workers, this means that office cleaners as a rule will never make much more than the minimum wage.Which is why, just over a year ago, Guillermo Garcia was perplexed by a job opening he heard about. He had been unemployed for six months  unable to find even minimum-wage work  when his counselor at Madison Strategies Group, a job-training-and-placement firm for low-income people in New York City, told him about the office-cleaning jobs that a brand-new company had listed. The company was called Managed by Q, and it was paying $12.50 an hour, or more than 40 percent above the citys minimum wage. Even more unbelievable, the job offered full health care benefits and a 401(k) plan.Garcia, 24, was born in a small, poor village in central Mexico. His parents brought him to New York City when he was 9. None of them have legal documentation. His father works at a carwash, his mother cleans houses. They dont make much. Guillermo finished high school in 2010  something his parents never did  but graduated into an economy that had a brutally low income ceiling for an undocumented worker like him, even one who grew up in the United States. (Because of a 2012 executive action by President Obama, Garcia is permitted to work legally and is protected from deportation.) The New York State Department of Labor recently released a report about salaries in New York City, and it makes for grim reading. Entry-level salaries for the kinds of jobs that someone like Garcia might apply for  retail clerk, food preparer, restaurant server, janitor, unskilled construction worker  are stuck right at or barely above the minimum wage, which is now $18,700 a year.A few weeks after hearing about the improbable job at Managed by Q, Garcia had it. And today, just over a year later, Garcias pay is up to $14.50 an hour, and a remarkable $21.75 when he works overtime, which he does as often as he can. His supervisor is talking to him about a promotion that would come with a higher salary. There are even rumors of stock options. His life has been transformed, almost as if he won the lottery.The chief executive of Managed by Q, Dan Teran, wants to be clear: His company is not a charity. Its plan is to become enormous and highly profitable. A little more than two years old, the company now cleans more than 2.1 million square feet of office space in New York City. (The fanciest two tiers of buildings, referred to as trophy and Class A in corporate-real-estate speak, typically hire their own in-house cleaning services, but Managed by Q currently cleans more than 1 percent of the rest, the so-called Class B and Class C offices.) In addition to cleaning, the company offers a whole suite of other services to its clients  maintenance, I.T. support, security, supplies and others. It has expanded its operations to San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles, with the eventual goal of conquering every major city in the United States and, eventually, the world.The company pays its staff, like Garcia, considerably more than prevailing market rates not solely because its founders want to be kind to them, but because Teran sees it as crucial to his business model. Teran believes that most American businesses, and especially fast-growing start-ups like Uber, have mistaken short-term gains for long-term value, undercutting the share of revenue that flows to workers in a way that will perversely hurt their bottom line. He believes, even more radically, that decades of rising inequality and stagnant wages in America are not an inevitable byproduct of capitalism; instead, they come from a simple misunderstanding about how best to deploy workers and recognize the value they bring to a company. The future of jobs in the United States would be very different if Terans ideas catch on. But first, of course, he has to prove that they actually work.The concept behind Managed by Q came when Teran and Saman Rahmanian, friends who met through New Yorks tech scene, realized that the various start-ups they had worked for always experienced the same weird problem. The office itself  the physical place in which the start-up worked  could never adapt as quickly as the company needed it to. Why was it such a pain to set up a new work space, or move a wall, or order new desk chairs, or bring in an exterminator? They imagined the dream office manager as something like the character Q in James Bond films, a quiet genius who understands technology and creates the tools that help Bond do his work. Thus the name: Managed by Q.The business would first present itself to new clients as a cleaning company. Thats because potential customers already know what a cleaning company is, and theyre often looking for a new and better one. But once the clients were sold on the high quality of the cleaning service, they would come to realize that Q (as employees call it) could do so much more. Every new client was given a wall-mounted iPad with an intuitive app. Someone could request through the iPad, say, more paper towels or an exterminator or furniture assembly or a walls being put up or taken down. Q would take care of all the details, quietly and quickly.At first, Teran was worried that his new idea would force him to make a horrible choice. He wanted to create a company that could pay a solid living wage to its workers and offer them good benefits. But he couldnt figure out how to make the numbers add up. After seeking advice from anyone he could find, he found himself talking to Dervala Hanley, who was then the vice president for global strategy at Starbucks. She told him that the answers to all of his questions were in a book: The Good Jobs Strategy, by Zeynep Ton, a professor of operations management at M.I.T. The book offers a careful study of a handful of large companies that have been able to pay their workers well above prevailing wages while also keeping overall costs down and earning a healthy profit. Typically, companies see workers entirely as a cost, something that reduces profit; as a result, many try to minimize the number of workers and the amount they are paid. But as Ton points out, when a company deploys its workers in smart ways, those workers can become a source of profit instead of just a cost. Q is a perfect example: Teran doesnt see his cleaners as simply cleaners. Instead, they are the essential link between Q and its clients.Teran told me that the best way to see this was by looking at a spreadsheet he had asked his chief financial officer to create. It was a simplified version of Qs own profit-and-loss statement alongside that of a fictitious competitor, based on standard industry data. The spreadsheet assumes that Q and its competitor, Non-Q, each begin with 100 clients, meaning 100 offices to clean every day. Non-Q pays $9 an hour for its workers; by hiring them as independent contractors rather than as salaried employees, Non-Q is also able to avoid paying Social Security taxes, overtime and other costs. Q, by contrast, pays $12.50 an hour plus benefits and Social Security taxes. This means that Non-Q realizes a total profit, per office, of $9,660, while Q makes a profit of only $7,980. It seems, at first blush, that Q has a terrible business model. The more customers it has, the further Q will fall behind the competition.But over time, the picture changes. The cleaning industry is famous for steep turnover in employees and customers; as with many commoditized, low-cost businesses, the end of every contract is an opportunity to see if someone else can do the job more cheaply. Industrywide, roughly half of a cleaning companys customers will choose a different firm every year, and it frequently costs about $1,750 in marketing and sales to acquire a new customer. Also, roughly half of a cleaning companys employees will leave in any given year, and it costs around $150 in advertising and human resources to refill each slot. Teran believes that by paying workers more  and training them to stay in close contact with customers to make sure they are satisfied  he can drastically reduce both turnover numbers.So far, it has worked: Only around 10 percent of clients leave each year, and only 5 percent of employees leave. This means Non-Q has to pay a lot of money every year just to keep the same number of customers and employees. Q can funnel that spending into expansion, acquiring more clients. Teran points out that on the spreadsheet, Non-Q does better in its first year of operation: It makes a net profit of $871,000, compared with Qs $709,450. It is only after a few years that the advantage of Q adds up. By the fifth year of operation, Q is bringing in 62 percent more profit than Non-Q.The real secret to Qs business, though, comes with the other services that it offers and facilitates through its app  maintenance, I.T. support, security and so on, some of which enjoy a significantly higher profit margin than its cleaning services do. With these allied services, Q functions as a matchmaker between its clients and a marketplace of service providers, working with a few carefully screened firms and connecting its clients with them quickly; Q then receives a percentage of their fee. Already, 30 percent of the companys revenue comes from services other than cleaning.The whole model works only if the clients trust Q. And the main contact with Q is that cleaner, or operator, who goes to the office every day. One reason Q pays its cleaners so much is that they effectively become a sales rep, smuggled every day inside the office of the customer. The better the cleaner is  the better trained and motivated and paid  the more effective a representative she can be, and the more money she can generate.For this reason, a main challenge  and one that will increase as the company grows  is selecting employees. Teran has invested heavily in data technology that allows the company to study the correlation between specific operators and clients and assess what sorts of relationships work best. Teran and his team learned that traditional markers of success  education, experience in the industry, recommendations from employers  were not tightly correlated with success at Q. Instead, Teran said, the two crucial personal characteristics are optimism and empathy.When I asked what he meant, Teran suggested I spend a shift with Nancy Gonzalez, one of the most successful workers at Q. She is now a supervisor, which means she visits several different offices each night to check on the operators and offer help. She also works with the administrative staff, matching operators to clients. For example, one of her accounts is quite meticulous, she said, so she always makes sure the operator assigned to it is quiet and diligent; another account, by contrast, prefers a more engaging operator with a bigger personality.Teran remembers when Gonzalez came in to interview; he was still able to meet all new recruits at the time. He gathered a group of recruits in a circle and asked them to describe a deeply negative experience. Gonzalez talked about facing the collapse of the bakery that she and her boyfriend owned in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The goal was to see what kinds of words she used to describe the fallout of the negative experience  to see if she was able to think positively even when recalling the most painful time in her life. Gonzalezs answer scored quite highly for optimism.After that, she was invited to a group exercise to explore her ability to work well with others. Several potential employees were asked to describe embarrassing incidents from their past. As Teran explained, the real goal of the exercise was to see how others behave when a person is presenting themselves in a vulnerable way. Gonzalez consistently showed enormous empathy, leaning forward, nodding along, unconsciously saying quiet, encouraging words. So she got the job, despite that fact that she had no cleaning experience, other than cleaning up her bakery and a home with seven kids.Her first assignment, when she joined in September 2014, was at the offices of a growing health-and-wellness company. The firm had a regular cleaning company that did a thorough job each night and used Q only for supplemental tidying during the day. Teran says the revenue from the firm was around $400 a month. The Q app allows customers to rate an operators performance on any given day and, right away, Gonzalez was receiving the highest grades every day  five stars, five stars, five stars. The client would put notes in the review about how Gonzalez was a joy to be around, how she repeatedly went beyond the call of duty. Twice, she spent her cleaning shift filling in for a sick receptionist. Soon, the client replaced its nighttime firm with Q. Then it asked Q to clean its other offices, as well as provide other services, like maintenance and supply management. Today, the client pays around $7,000 a month to Q over all. So, in this one case, Gonzalez was central to bringing in an additional $79,200 in revenue per year.Why dont more chief executives see the math the way Teran does? In large part because all the short-term incentives of corporate America point them in the opposite direction. Suppose that in 10 years, Terans ambitions are realized and Q is a multibillion-dollar company with a million employees worldwide. By then, Teran might no longer be C.E.O., and the company would be overseen by a board selected by its top investors. Just imagine the pressures on that chief executive. If the company cut worker pay by $1 a week, the firm would instantly realize a profit of $52 million a year. Then imagine that the company cut wages by $1 an hour. That would mean additional profit of $2.1 billion. Maybe the chief executive would realize that cutting pay would inspire many to quit. But he could cut the working time in each office by, say, 10 percent, allowing Q to lay off  or not hire  100,000 workers worldwide.This is how lousy jobs and stagnant wages arrive. Each company makes a series of relatively small decisions, based on what competitors are doing and what customers and investors are demanding. Soon, a new, lower norm is established, and the pressures are on everybody else to follow. In standard economic models, its simply assumed: Wages fall to the point where supply meets demand. This is why Teran plans that by the time Q is publicly traded  if it ever is  he will have so fully built out the model that even the most hardheaded successor will continue to implement it. And its why he is also working hard to persuade other chief executives to take his ideas seriously.This month, I sat in on a phone call Teran had with Colin Barceloux, the chief executive of ConvoyNow, a service that sends I.T. workers to private homes to fix computer emergencies. Barceloux had assumed that he would use the Uber model, allowing independent I.T. professionals to receive a message any time somebody wanted help. Barceloux explained to Teran that his company is so new that he has no idea how much demand there will be in any given city at any given time, so he cant hire people and pay them a fixed wage.But Teran countered that Barceloux was thinking about the issue in the wrong way. If his customers had a different I.T. person each time they used the app, and the providers didnt end up giving the same level of service, the customers would fall away. To follow the Q strategy, Teran acknowledged, Barceloux might need to rethink his business: Focus on fewer cities, or even start with just one, and build up the model locally. Perhaps there were other related services that ConvoyNow could provide, to take advantage of its trained workers.I followed up with Barceloux a few weeks later. He was still convinced by Terans argument, and he hoped to shift his business to a model closer to Qs, in which the people serving customers are employees, not independent contractors. But he wouldnt be able to offer those employees full-time work, or maybe even predictable schedules. As he pointed out, the peculiarities of the cleaning business  that its a service that clients contract for every day, on a regular basis  are crucial to why Managed by Q can offer truly good jobs. Will the strategy really work for other industries, including his own? Barceloux was not entirely sure, but he planned to spend this year trying to figure out if it can."}
{"text": "The title house master as used by generations of Ivy League students to describe their residential administrators is fast becoming an anachronism. Harvard University announced Wednesday that, in a spirit of diversity and an inclusive community, the term was being replaced with faculty dean.The title of master had come under fire by some students and others at Harvard and other universities, including Yale and Princeton, for conjuring connotations of slavery, although its roots are from centuries-old European terms for a teacher, chief servant or head of household.Never before had the house leaders been so united in their belief that such a change is important to our efforts to create an intellectually, socially, and personally transformative experience for our students, Michael D. Smith, dean of the Harvard faculty of arts and sciences, wrote Wednesday in a long, searching email to faculty and staff members and to students.He said the change did not necessarily mean that the old title was wrong.I have not been shown any direct connection between the term house master and the institution of slavery, he wrote. Nor, he said, wasHarvard repudiating the inspiration it took fromEuropean institutions or capitulating to student demands.He said the title faculty dean had been chosen because it was familiar. He acknowledged that some alumni would feel a sentimental pang of loss. Many alumni will remember house leaders as the master of their beloved house, and they should have no qualms in doing so, he wrote.

{"text": "WASHINGTON  If its up to the Treasury Department, public employees in Puerto Rico who were promised pensions could be better off than investors who bought the islands bonds.A broad plan being put forward by the Treasury Department to ease Puerto Ricos financial crisis would put pension payments to retirees ahead of payments to bondholders  a move that some experts fear could rattle the larger municipal bond market.The proposal was being driven by evidence that Puerto Ricos pension system is nearly out of money, leaving retirees who are dependent on it financially vulnerable.The major problem is, the entire pension system is close to being depleted, said Antonio Weiss, counselor to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. But 330,000 people depend on it. Its unfunded, and they have to be protected.Shielding retirees from pension cuts, the thinking goes, would not only protect thousands of older residents on the island, but it might also encourage younger retirees to stay there, rather than move to the United States mainland in search of new jobs and incomes.Out-migration is considered a prime cause of Puerto Ricos financial tailspin, because it shrinks the islands economy, leaving fewer people and fewer dollars to support the crushing debt.Puerto Rico is said to have about $72 billion of financial debt outstanding, most of it in the form of municipal bonds. By some estimates, it has incurred an additional $43 billion in unfunded pension obligations.But deciding that pensioners interests should be put above those of bondholders  if a choice must be made  is not without certain risks.Some public-finance experts say they fear that if Puerto Rico can renege on promises to pay debts to investors, while sparing retirees, other municipalities might try to do the same, casting a pall over the larger market in municipal bonds, where American towns and cities have gone for decades to get the money they need to build roads, schools and other public works.If Puerto Rico gets special treatment, you have huge contagion risk to the entire municipal market, Andrew N. Rosenberg, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, said at a recent gathering of creditor representatives.Treasury officials said such concerns were unfounded. The framework they are proposing would be designed only for distressed United States territories, like Puerto Rico, and could not be used by states or municipalities on the mainland.Officials pointed to a report by an investment firm, Nuveen Asset Management, which said, We believe most institutional investors understand Puerto Ricos unique situation and the coming debt restructuring will not create widespread credit implications.Still, moving public pensions to the top of the stack would infuriate at least some bondholders  especially those who paid close to face value for their bonds years ago, when they were still rated investment grade, and who had expected to hold them to maturity and get all their principal back.Although the bondholders have often been portrayed as deep-pocketed vultures since Puerto Ricos debt crisis began, many of them are small investors, themselves trying to save for a comfortable retirement.Most Puerto Rican debt is held by individuals, said Thomas Moers Mayer, a lawyer representing two large mutual fund companies, Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds, which together own about $10 billion in Puerto Rican debt securities. They are mostly over 65, and they mostly have incomes of less than $100,000 a year. They are not vulture funds. They are your friends and neighbors.Some Republican senators  notably Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah  whose constituents are among the bondholders, have expressed similar views. Puerto Ricos debt is unusually widely held because it offered above average yields and interest that was exempt from federal, state and local taxes, no matter where the buyer lived.Treasury officials have said they are willing to work with Congress to find a suitable way of handling the different categories of creditors.Financial help for Puerto Rico will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday by the House Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. Weiss is scheduled to be the sole witness.Any rescue plan would need congressional approval and various committees in the House and Senate are weighing ways to help the island reduce its debt and better manage its economy.Paul D. Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, has set a deadline of March 30 for a House version of a bill. A version of Treasurys plan was outlined in a draft bill presented to a Senate committee; it has not been voted on.The draft, obtained by The New York Times, also calls for a five-member fiscal reform assistance council appointed by the president to hold the island to meaningful budgeting, disclosure and fiscal reform practices. The board would have the power to make across-the-board budget cuts if necessary.Members of Congress, especially Republicans, have expressed concern about whether Puerto Rico has the wherewithal to manage its future finances, even if it gets help in the short term. Credit markets have also been reluctant to invest further in Puerto Ricos bonds without some assurances that the islands finances will be better managed in the years to come.The idea of an oversight board has rankled residents, however, who say it has overtones of colonialism.The part of the proposal that gives priority to pensioners has received little attention. Currently, Puerto Ricos laws and Constitution give top priority to general-obligation bonds  the type backed by the governments good faith, credit and taxing power.Puerto Rico is not unique in this respect; for decades, the general-obligation bonds of all the states have been marketed as virtually default-proof, safe enough for widows and orphans. The concept was developed after the Civil War, as a way to rebuild investor trust after a number of notorious bond defaults.Other bonds carry with them varying degrees of legal repayment security. Puerto Ricos debt is extraordinarily complex, but in general, its bonds can be ranked in a hierarchy of eight levels, with general-obligation bonds at the top. The ranking is described in  an analysis of the debt by the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research group in San Juan.Public workers pensions, the center found, fall on a second hierarchy altogether, which sets priorities for the governments operational disbursements. Here again, however, payments due on general-obligation bonds come first, followed by payments due on legally binding contracts. Outlays for pensions come third.That means that under existing law in Puerto Rico, if there is not enough money to pay both general-obligation bonds and public retirees pensions, the money would go to bondholders.But the Treasurys proposed restructuring framework would change that. It would require that the restructuring plan not unduly impair the claims of any class of pensioners.General-obligation bondholders, on the other hand, would get such protection only if feasible, according to the draft that outlined the plan.This new legal framework is being created because Puerto Rico, as a United States territory, has no access to bankruptcy laws, where complicated claims by creditors can be worked out in a court under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge.Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its bonds. More payments are due in May and June. Bonds are now nearly impossible to sell, and members of Congress, especially Democrats, as well as financial experts say the islands troubles will become increasingly enormous if some kind of restructuring framework is not approved soon."}
{"text": "OTTAWA   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not yet fulfilled his promise to legalize marijuana in Canada, but the countrys Federal Court ruled Wednesday that prescription holders could grow their own supply.The decision is the latest in a series of court rulings on the issue, including decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada, that found that denying medical access to marijuana violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.The ruling adds to confusion about the legal status of marijuana, partly created by the lack of detail surrounding the Liberal governments plan. Twenty-nine companies, many well funded, were licensed by the previous Conservative government to grow and sell medical marijuana, but they may now face financial pressure.The evidence at trial failed to show that public safety will be advanced in any significant way by the removal of the ability to lawfully and safely continue to personally produce medical cannabis, Judge Michael L. Phelan wrote in the decision.Judge Phelan suspended his order for six months to allow the government time to come up with a new system and regulations to allow and control home growing.He said that the current law restricted patients liberty by leaving them under the threat of criminal prosecution and that it was overly broad and not supported by compelling evidence.The decision, which was based on a legal challenge brought by four medical marijuana users, is likely to return Canada to a variation of its previous system. Also the result of a court ruling, that system gave patients licenses to grow medical marijuana or have someone else do it for them. The federal government also sold subsidized marijuana itself.But the previous Conservative government became alarmed by the rapid growth in the number of people growing marijuana as well as the cost and its ability to inspect the operations. In 2013, it scrapped the home-growing licenses and required prescription holders to buy from tightly regulated commercial producers.Many patients, including those who brought the Federal Court case, complained that the new system denied them access to strains of marijuana that they believe are particularly effective for their conditions. They also were concerned about the cost of marijuana from the new companies."}

During the evening, a friend noticed that there was a handsome man looking over my shoulder and checking me out. By the time I turned around, this tall stranger was gone, and the chance to meet him lost.Later, when I got up to leave, I noticed that he had dropped his gray scarf on the table next to my chair. Being a little too versed in my romantic comedies, I decided to hold onto the scarf and left my name and phone number with the matre d in case my handsome stranger returned.That night, I noticed a missed call from an unknown number, but thankfully, there was a voice mail message.The message said: Hi Lisa. This is Katie. I heard you inadvertently took my scarf and I would really like it back. Please return it as soon as possible to the Sea Grill and Ill pick it up. Thank you."}

He won the Iowa caucuses in the 2008 presidential race, but failed to gain traction this year as Mr. Trump galvanized voters with the same populist message that Mr. Huckabee used.Mr. Huckabee has not endorsed a candidate yet, but his daughters presence on the Trump campaign will send a signal. I have great respect for Governor Mike Huckabee, and we have a mutual admiration for our wonderful families, Mr. Trump said in a statement Thursday.In an accompanying statement, Ms. Huckabee offered a validation of Mr. Trump, who used to support abortion rights, as a social conservative.Like the other Republican candidates, Mr. Trump is pro-life, pro-marriage, and will appoint conservatives to the courts, Ms. Huckabee said. What makes Mr. Trump my choice for president is he will break the grip of the donor class on our government and make it accountable to working families again.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas could also do well in Arkansas on Tuesday. Mr. Trump is looking to gather enough delegates in states such as Alabama and Massachusetts, where polls show him having a large lead, that he becomes virtually unstoppable in securing the Republican nomination.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump secured his first two congressional endorsements, including Representative Chris Collins of New York, who had been supporting Jeb Bush but said on MSNBC that he had been drifting toward Mr. Trump for weeks."}
{"text": "MILAN  After Gucci postponed its show on Wednesday for more than an hour over a late plane from London, the first day of Milan Fashion Week tipped into delay after delay with dominolike effect.Spare a thought for celebrities caught in the chaos: young stars, like the sister-and-brother acting pair Dylan and Hopper Penn, found sitting in an otherwise empty front row at the Fay show. The two feature in the brands latest campaign and had flown in especially for the collections unveiling.Its our first Fay show, said Ms. Penn, fresh from shooting covers for Vogue Brazil and Vogue Korea. I didnt even know about the brand until we were hired.We came in late last night and are headed to London tomorrow to visit our mom, who is shooting there, she added. Their mother is the House of Cards star Robin Wright; their father is the actor and political activist Sean Penn.Ms. Penn was looking forward to returning to her home in Los Angeles, where she will be hunting for funding for a short-film project with a friend. Hopper, her younger brother, a cut on his nose, was still reeling from a recent stint living in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, while filming a coming movie, War Machine.Its a dark war comedy, and we traveled over the border every day for a month to shoot in Iraq, he said. Mr. Penn added that the area wasnt exactly the sort of place youd go back to on vacation.We were playing Third Platoon Marines, so there was hard-core boot camp work every day, he continued, looking wide-eyed around him and at the gradually swelling crowd. It was all a very long way from fashion week. Im still very new to this kind of thing."}
{"text": "Corrupt police officers work with gang members and the Russian mob to pull off a heist in Triple 9, an action thriller directed by John Hillcoat (The Road, The Proposition).In this scene, the Atlanta police are tracking down a gang leader at an apartment complex. In a recent interview, Mr. Hillcoat discussed the scene and his film. Below are excerpts from that conversation.What was interesting to you about telling this story?I wanted to do a contemporary crime thriller that feels more real about whats happening out there. Things have developed to where the new criminal landscape includes paramilitary background, and theres been a militarization of the police. What was interesting about the story was the moral slipperiness of it all. The training that cops have is so deeply ingrained that even when its corrupted, you dont know which way theyre going to jump. So I thought the surprises, twists and turns in the story would be interesting.What was your inspiration looking at the genre?I wanted the gritty realism of films like The French Connection. I wanted the moral murkiness of a film like Prince of the City and the TV show The Wire. And the tradition of film noir was very much inspiring.You had an interest in making the film feel more realistic. How did that play out with this scene?Initially it had a lot of the movie clichs, involving the way cops would burst into doors, firing and running all the way through. What I didnt know at first was that they dont go in that way anymore. Now, with the military training, they have a shield. It changed how we visualized and orchestrated the scene.Did you use advisers on the shoot?Yes, they were both behind the scenes and in front of the camera as well. In this situation, we were working with the Atlanta gang unit, a separate unit within the police force. For scenes with the Russian Israeli mob, I talked to the F.B.I. and did independent research. We had advisers from the streets all the way up to high level law enforcement."}
{"text": "Welcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social-media presences of celebrities.The average Amy Sedaris Instagram post is morbidly compelling in the same way as a yellowed photo that might accompany a recipe for some very unappetizing 1970s-era hors doeuvre: You dont really want to eat it, but you cant stop looking at it. Im convinced that Sedaris has access to a secret Instagram filter that, instead of saturating the brightest colors or dialing up the rosiness, renders everything she posts a little off: flatter and less appealing, like someone has suddenly turned on a fluorescent light.A little off might be an understatement, actually, particularly for the medium. Its a misconception that the most successful Instagram accounts deal exclusively in perfection. Lots of posts dabble in wabi-sabi: the smallest, most deliberate flaw, the hair out of place that draws attention to the pretty face its framing. Sedaris doesnt often do this kind of Instagram-friendly irregularity. Her interest in the unflattering runs much deeper, to a full-hearted embrace of the grotesque and the uncanny, like a John Waters movie that lasts only as long as you keep scrolling.Im glad Sedaris has an Instagram account in part because the prankster photographers Pierpaolo Ferrari and Maurizio Cattelan of Toiletpaper magazine dont: She shares their winking, gleefully gross vintage spirit, the midcentury housewife who has gone totally, merrily batty. (To understand the surrealist appeal of this kind of aesthetic, look no further than the photos Cattelan and Ferrari took last year for The New York Times Magazine of dishes from the 1971 Betty Crocker Recipe Card Library.) Its an extension of a sensibility Sedaris began to establish with her role in the off-kilter, absurdist TV comedy Strangers with Candy and has honed ever since. Her 2006 book on entertaining, I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence, includes such nuggets of advice as I like when a guest shows up with confectioners sugar, light bulbs or a roll of those heavy blue gas-station paper towels. Her 2010 book is called Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People! You get the idea.Categorically speaking, Sedaris posts a lot of the same kinds of things everyone does, filling her feed both with her own snapshots and photos she finds on various corners of the web: cute animals, food, manicures and pedicures. But a lot of the animals are cute in weird, bad ways: obese or stoned-looking or dangling an extra-long tongue or looking psychotically at a piece of meat. Sedaris looks psychotically at pieces of meat, too: her food photos act, almost to a fault, as extremely effective appetite suppressants. (She does, in fact, have a thing for horrific hors doeuvres.) And rather than posting impressive nail art, Sedaris somehow sources  over and over  badly lit photos of freakishly long toenails, often ornately pedicured. If they should be straining the elastic limits of a pair of beige nylon stockings, all the better.She might post a collection of knitting patterns for Lesbian Funeral Shawls (Photoshopped, I think?), or book covers reading Donkey Man: A Womans Guide to Tijuana or If God Loves Me, Why Cant I Get My Locker Open?: Devotionals for Teens or Those Amazing Leeches (real, I think). She might post a tiny, dirty pair of dolls ice skates, framed just so; a woman wearing jorts and giant Lucite stripper heels, bending over her cart in a Walmart; a dogs butt made up to look like a human face; a squirrel cuddling its newborn  or is it eating it?One of my duties as an online editor at T, The Timess style magazine, is to maintain that publications Instagram page. As a result, I spend a lot of my day playing with gorgeous, perfectly lit, beautifully composed images: gardens, couture, art, intimidatingly classy living rooms, Rihannas face. I love working with this kind of photo, but it can be dangerous to get used to; emerging back into the real world after you spend too much time on Instagram is a jarring comedown. Used properly, Sedariss page is an indispensable antidote. I visit it a few times a week for a quick, two-minute shot of the opposite  something yucky, probably, but always surprising, after which the real world feels, well, at least not quite that bad.Sedariss Instagram works even better when encountered organically, as Instagram intends: as an intermittent interruption to your feed, a prettiness palate-cleanser, a single blip of creepy Americana to break up all the aai bowls and Rain Room photos. So much ink has been spilled about the aspirational quality of Instagram, and the medium is ideal for that. But aspiration is a complex feeling, a flutter of ambition, resignation, envy and appreciation, all at once, that lives somewhere in the upper chest cavity, between your heart and a lump in your throat. The kind of unwholesome interest a Sedaris-gram inspires is situated much lower, and feels more immediate: somewhere between a belly laugh and being a punched in the gut. It can be nice, occasionally, to trade the fraughtness of FOMO for a pure, uncomplicated double take.Though she doesnt do it as obnoxiously or as frequently as most other celebrities do, Sedaris does occasionally post shout-outs or allusions to her friends, and theyre an impressive bunch: Jennifer Aniston, Lena Dunham, Marcel Dzama, Amy Schumer, Sarah Jessica Parker. One such pal is the tattoo artist Scott Campbell, who was indirectly responsible for my most shocking and terrifying discovery of all while researching this article: the realization that @amysedaris, the foul rag and bone shop of Instagram, the junkyard at the end of the social-media universe, contained a picture I had somehow previously missed, of  me. In among the dirty valentines, feetloaf and hairless cats, there was my own arm, photographed for a project in which Campbell gave mystery tattoos to blind participants through a hole in a wall. (Its a long story.) I was surprised and delighted to see it, but I felt a little queasy, too  the photo itself isnt unflattering, but surrounded by all that Sedaris filter, it was awfully jarring. So I did the only thing you can do: I kept scrolling, looking for something worse."}
{"text": "Ask James L. Manning, the pastor of the Atlah Worldwide Church, why he is involved in a legal battle to save his redbrick building in Harlem from foreclosure, and he gives the same answer he employs when talking about many of the worlds problems. Its primarily about my very vigorous opposition to the sodomy activity going on in this community, he said.Mr. Manning, who is known to post his thoughts on a giant signboard outside his church at West 123rd Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, has for years promoted his belief that certain parties carry out the devils work. They include, but are not limited to, gay people (whom Jesus would stone), President Obama (black Hitler) and immigrants (boycott them).These views have long provoked neighbors and others, many of whom have staged protests outside the church. But Mr. Mannings latest battle centers on issues more prosaic than ideological: His church, according to New York City, has not paid its bills.Specifically, the church has never paid its water and sewage bills, according to the citys Department of Environmental Protection. Mr. Manning insists he has defaulted on purpose, based on his conviction that Atlah should be allowed the same relief as other city religious institutions, and not be required to pay for those services.He has fought with the city for years on the matter, and most recently won a temporary halt to a foreclosure auction that had been scheduled for this week.While news of threatened churches often elicits feelings of sympathy in the community, the struggles of Atlah have been met with widespread glee. (When hearing that the auction had been put off, State Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a Democrat who represents the area, sighed. Hopefully the Lord will find a way, he said.)Still, his churchs travails have raised Mr. Mannings public profile. His sermons, which are streamed on the Internet, have attracted large numbers of viewers, and he has appeared on The Daily Show.But the churchs financial state has also served as a call to action for those who revile him: At least two gay advocacy groups have sought to buy the church in the event of foreclosure, in an effort not just to obtain a valuable piece of property, but also, they say, to achieve a measure of divine retribution.According to court records, the church owes over $1 million, after a portion of its outstanding water bill was sold by the city as a lien.The lien holder, the Bank of New York Mellon, was moving forward with a foreclosure auction until the church won the recent restraining order from Justice Barbara Jaffe in State Supreme Court. The news of the planned foreclosure auction was reported by DNAinfo.com, a local news website.The judge will hold a hearing in April, when the church is to make its case as a tax-exempt institution, Stuart F. Shaw, a lawyer for the church, said. The debt, the lien sale and the foreclosure auction never should have happened, he said.Besides providing worship services, Atlahs building includes a soup kitchen, a small homeless shelter and a school with grades from kindergarten through high school.The stalled sale disappointed some of Atlahs critics. Rivers of Living Water, a church in Manhattan that welcomes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members, and the Ali Forney Center, a homeless shelter in Manhattan for gay youths, among others, are both raising money to try to buy the church.We believe it would be divine justice, Vanessa Brown, the pastor of Rivers of Living Water, said, for an affirming church to replace what has been an epicenter of gay hate, and transform it into a center of love and light.Whether Atlah does in fact owe the money is a question that the court may have to answer. Religious or nonprofit groups can qualify for an exemption from New York City water and sewer bills after applying to the Department of Environmental Protection.Indeed, the church, which bought the building in the 1980s, has applied five times since 1991 and been denied each time, according to Edward Timbers, a spokesman for the agency. The reason given was that not all of the church building, which includes several residential apartments, was engaged for religious uses.After each application, Mr. Timbers said, the church and its representatives were given the option of setting up separate water meters for various parts of the building. But the church never did, he said.Mr. Manning, who said that he found God while in prison, is a dapper dresser. He speaks with a booming voice. When he strolls through his church, past the chipping balustrades, small children run up and smother him with hugs. He is open about his beliefs.Jesus was not about all of this love that people say, he said in an interview in his church office. Jesus is the only one in the Bible speaking about sending anyone to hell. This business from the sodomites, about love and forgiveness, is twisting of the Scripture.The church, which goes by several other names, including Bethelite Community Baptist Church, is saddled with other debts, according to public databases. They show that Mr. Manning personally owes more than $25,000 in unpaid taxes to New York State, something that he flatly denies. Last year, the church was fined by the Landmarks Preservation Commission for several unapproved changes to its building, the exterior of which is a designated landmark.To Mr. Manning, all his troubles can be seen as an attempt to silence him. At issue, he says, is not debt, but freedom of speech.We shouldnt be attacked by the Landmarks Commission, we should not be attacked by this water bill, he said. The world needs to know that people who do not support sodomy should have the freedom to reject it, without prejudice."}

{"text": "At 19, Mark DeFriest was sentenced to four years in prison after stealing some tools.That was in 1980. Hes been behind bars since  mostly.Mr. DeFriests initial crime in Florida was arguably a misunderstanding. He took tools that his deceased father had bequeathed to him before his fathers will had been legally processed.Since then, Mr. DeFriest, now 55, has remained a prisoner because of his 13 escape attempts, seven of them successful, earning him the nickname Prison Houdini and more than 30 additional years of incarceration.On Wednesday, Mr. DeFriest had a chance to gain his freedom legally during a parole hearing in Florida. Instead, the parole commission gave him six more months, with an effective release date in August, so that he can complete a transitional program that teaches life skills, Mr. DeFriests lawyer said.It went well enough today that I would consider it a victory, John Middleton, a lawyer who has represented Mr. DeFriest for decades, said in an interview.Mr. Middleton said the release date did not guarantee that he would be freed this year. Mr. DeFriest still has time to serve for infractions committed while imprisoned in California and Alabama. Only if those penalties are lifted will he be paroled in six months.Mr. DeFriest has gained national notoriety thanks in part to his elaborate escape attempts, many of which were recounted in a 2014 documentary, The Mind of Mark DeFriest. The films director, Gabriel London, has become one of Mr. DeFriests strongest advocates, testifying on the inmates behalf at the Wednesday hearing.In one escape attempt, Mr. DeFriest claims to have dosed a staff coffeepot at a state mental institution with the powerful psychotropic drug LSD, which had been kept in the infirmary. He said security personnel were alerted before he could make his getaway.In another, he removed one of his teeth to warrant a trip to the dentist. He then used improvised firearms he had built in the hospitals wood shop to escape. The firearms, or zip guns as Mr. DeFriest calls them, were a reliable prop in several of his escape bids.Trying to convince Mr. DeFriest to behave was kind of like telling a kid Dont put your hand in the cookie jar,  said Mr. Middleton.Mr. Londons film portrays Mr. DeFriest as a something of a disturbed genius, a person who could memorize and recreate the teeth on a jailers keys but who lacked the discipline to stop trying to escape.Mr. DeFriests sentences snowballed with each offense, including his most serious crime: stealing a car at gunpoint after one of his escapes. At one point, he was to be locked up through 2085.The number of people rallying on Mr. DeFriests behalf also grew. Many cited mental competency as the root of his troubles. One of his loyal defenders, a pen pal 30 years his senior, became his wife without ever meeting him in person.In December 2014, after Mr. Middleton and others testified before the Florida parole commission that Mr. DeFriest had never been mentally competent enough to stand trial, his sentence was sharply reduced.The hearing on Wednesday represented his first chance to legally go free in 36 years. Mr. London expressed frustration over the outcome.He and Mr. Middleton blamed the six-month extension on a bureaucratic error made in communications between Florida and Oregon where Mr. DeFriest was moved to be near his wife in preparation for his release  that mistakenly classified him as still serving a life sentence.As a result, he was never enrolled in a required transitional program. Mr. DeFriest will up for release again in August only if completes the six-month practical skills course intended to help convicts avoid committing crimes again.On Wednesday, Mr. DeFriest expressed exasperation in a statement to the panel, according to state records. I havent had problems since I moved here to Oregon but I feel like I have been sent out here and set up to fail, he said."}

{"text": "Maodo Lo, the lissome Columbia senior attracting N.B.A. attention this season, snatched a brochure as he walked into the Susan Eley Fine Art gallery on the Upper West Side one recent afternoon.I like to understand the reasons and inspirations when I go see artwork, he said, tugging his earbuds out from underneath a gray hoodie.The gallerys director, Susan Eisner Eley, approached, and within minutes, she was leading Lo on a tour of the salon-style showcase of exposed brick walls covered with vibrant, frenzied works: grays, violets, reds and blues.Shes a colorist, Eley said of the artist. Just like your mom.Lo flashed a smile. Even as his college career nears its end, few know that Los mother, Elvira Bach, is a renowned German postmodernist painter and sculptor whose pieces have hung inside the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art, among other galleries in places like Paris, London, Lisbon, Vancouver and Venice.When Columbias coach, Kyle Smith, who recruited Lo four years ago out of a prep school in western Massachusetts, found this out recently, he pulled Lo aside.I knew she was an artist, but Im like, dude, Smith said. Thats like saying my dad used to coach  hes in Springfield, referring to the site of the Basketball Hall of Fame.It is not that Lo does not want to tell people. It just never comes up, he often says with a shrug. His mothers artistic talent would seem to have little relevance to his blossoming basketball career, which has placed him firmly in contention to become the first Columbia player to win the Ivy Leagues player of the year award since Craig Austin in 2001.But on off days, and especially before and after the season, the 6-foot-3 Lo regularly finds time to wander into galleries like this one, where the paintings seem to speak to him in ways that the basketball gym doesnt.Though Lo claims to have little artistic talent of his own, he treasures these escapes from the rigors of basketball, and says he visits the galleries to show appreciation to the artists.I know how much work you have to put in, he said. You cant just say Im going to draw a painting today. Its a process  you need to be inspired, you need to have the right energy, the right ideas. You need to be cognizant of what the viewers might like. You have to trust your own creativity and let it go.In an email through her assistant, who translated the message from German, Bach wrote that she never pushed Lo toward either athletics or art, but rather allowed him to find his passion on his own.He is not an Artist as I am, she wrote. He is an Artist from another perspective, an Artist with a Basketball in his Hands. To me, Basketball is Art when I watch Maodo because we both are using our hands to create and build impressions.Raised in Berlin, Lo was named in honor of a celebrated West African religious figure, Malick Sy, by his father, Alioune, a couscous farmer who lives in Kaffrine, a southern region of Senegal. Lo said that people referred to Sy as Maodo, which he translated as the Great One, although he hesitated to mention this. He did not want to seem boastful.Soft-spoken and reserved, Lo has developed into one of the Ivy Leagues most dangerous players. He leads the conference in steals, averaging 2.3 a game, good for 14th in Division I, and has made more 3-pointers than anyone else in Columbias history. He has bolstered his midrange game, too, incorporating techniques for shooting from his off-foot used by Atlanta Hawks guard Dennis Schroeder, one of Los teammates on the German national team.Columbia (19-8, 8-2) is third in the Ivy League, one game behind the top team, Yale, as it fights for its first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 1968. The Lions next big test is at Princeton (18-5, 8-1) on Friday night.Los play has earned him comparisons to N.B.A. players like the 14-year veteran Leandro Barbosa and to Patty Mills, whom Smith coached at St. Marys. Los game, Smith said, has a light-footed, almost airy quality.He can get to the basket, and theres no contact anywhere  he doesnt get touched, Smith said.Los finesse is largely self-made. His father favored soccer, and though Bach said that she used to run triathlons and her mother played handball, her son discovered basketball on his own. Her understanding of the game grew accordingly. Lo said that she used to attend his youth games, bring a newspaper, and forget to put the paper down when play resumed after timeouts.Their home, which was like its own art gallery, with paintings and looming sculptures and zebra-striped wallpaper, looked far different from his friends places. As a boy, he admitted having difficulty reconciling his mothers artistic persona  her look often included large sunglasses and a polychrome turban  with what seemed cool.When I was in school, Id tell me mom, Please dont wear the turban, dont wear your sunglasses, Lo said. It wasnt normal. But as I grew older, I understood  shes an artist, she is cool, its cool the way she dresses. I started to appreciate it.Lo, who has one older brother, used to travel with Bach to exhibitions of her latest works. It was on those trips, Bach wrote, that Maodo started to learn and understand my life.I loved it, to be honest, Lo said. I ate interesting foods, stayed in interesting places, met interesting people.When it came time to pursue his basketball career  first at a prep school in western Massachusetts, then at Columbia, the only university he officially visited  Lo kept his family background mostly to himself. His freshman roommate, Isaac Cohen, said Lo was quiet. Then one day, he mentioned that he was going downtown to Chelsea to visit an art gallery, so Cohen tagged along.I think its just part of his life, Cohen said. Its second nature. Ive seen pictures of his apartment back home in Berlin, and her work is everywhere. You can see it in the color of the couches and the rugs. Art is just something hes drawn to.At the Eley gallery, Lo was drawn to a painting of Egon Schiele, the early Austrian expressionist, which seemed to convey a deeper message about masculinity. He noticed a painting of a nude woman on one of the walls and, after inspecting it, asked the director for the name of the work.Tessa, Eley said.Lo began to laugh. I know a girl named Tessa, he said.Does she look like that?Lo blushed.Before leaving the gallery, he pulled a book out of his backpack that contained his mothers latest artwork. He flipped to a picture of a 2007 painting called 24 Hours, which depicts a woman wearing lipstick and bright blue eye shadow holding a young boy in her lap. Thats me, Lo said.Are there any paintings that include basketball?Ive been trying to get her to do that for years, Lo said. Shes not interested."}

{"text": "ANAHEIM, Calif.   The N.H.L.s Ducks hosted Orange Countys biggest field trip on Tuesday when they welcomed roughly 16,000 elementary school students to Honda Center. Anaheim players enjoyed the task of using hockey to educate children on some basic tenets of science. But they also admitted that the event, now in its 16th year, is considerably more fun when the team is winning.And after a disastrous start to their season, the Ducks are winning a lot.Anaheim slogged through a 1-7-2 start that appeared to put Coach Bruce Boudreaus job in peril, but the Ducks have rocketed up the Pacific Division standings in the past two months. That dominance was on full display during a recent make-or-break trip spanning seven games over 12 days in which Anaheim was 5-1-1.We talked about how a lot of people probably think it is going to be our downfall, center Ryan Kesler said of the trip. Its a long, grueling trip traveling a lot of miles. We just kept winning. Thats been our model since Christmas. Just play.The road swing was the high-water mark of a remarkable turnaround for Anaheim, but upon their return, Ducks players were mostly preoccupied with maintaining their strong play at home.Its not always easy; you tend to have a letdown when you get back home after that, their captain, Ryan Getzlaf, said. We were able to turn that around and play the right way again against Calgary.Kicking off a five-game homestand against the Flames on Sunday night, the Ducks continued their hot play with a 5-2 victory. With a 1-0 victory against the Buffalo Sabres on Wednesday, Anaheim has gone 20-4-2 since Christmas. The Ducks entered Thursdays games only 2 points behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division. The Ducks play the Kings on Sunday night in Anaheim.I think since Christmas weve been a defense-first hockey team, Kesler said. It really got us through that tough time when we werent scoring. Now were scoring and were playing well at both ends of the rink. I think thats why weve been able to continue to roll.Lack of scoring was at the root of Anaheims early-season struggles. The Ducks scored 10 goals and were shut out five times in their 10 October games. That level of futility was unfamiliar to a Ducks club that led the N.H.L. with 263 goals in 2013-14 and had the Western Conferences best record last season.The Ducks rediscovered their scoring touch during their post-holiday surge. They have 46 goals in 12 February games, rising to 25th in league goal rankings after being last for most of the season.That jump in scoring was sparked by Boudreaus separating Getzlaf and Corey Perry, the teams two best offensive players.Linemates for much of their 11 seasons together in Anaheim, Perry and Getzlaf were suddenly split up last month in the hopes of creating a more balanced offensive attack.Boudreau applied the same strategy in February 2015, leading to a 7-1-0 run that helped position Anaheim atop the conference. A lengthy playoff run ended in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Chicago Blackhawks, the eventual champions.Perhaps no one has benefited more from the Perry-Getzlaf split than Rickard Rakell. Teamed with Perry, Rakell, a 22-year-old Swede, has enjoyed a breakout season. His 15 goals are second on the Ducks behind Perrys 23, and his four game-winning goals are tied with Perry and Getzlaf for the team lead.I think things are just clicking right now, Rakell said. Everybody has bought into the system. Its a good feeling around the locker room right now. I think the team is just going with it and were having fun. Its a good time to be out there.Rakell is not the only player to have recently enjoyed a sudden offensive emergence in Anaheim.David Perron was acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins on Jan. 15 in exchange for forward Carl Hagelin and has since found success skating alongside Getzlaf. Joining his third team in the past 13 months, Perron has appeared right at home in Anaheim. He has six goals and eight assists in 16 games after collecting 16 points in 43 games with the Penguins. More important, the Ducks have gone 13-2-1 with Perron in their lineup.While the Ducks discovered an efficient configuration up front, their defense has also rounded into form. Cam Fowler and Simon Despres returned from lengthy injury absences in the past month. Fowler has been among the Ducks leaders in ice time since returning and has invigorated the power play.Sami Vatanens game-winning power-play goal Wednesday against the Sabres marked the sixth straight game in which Anaheim has scored with the man advantage. They have gone 9 for 21 in that span, a 42.9 percent success rate.The power play is working really good and the goaltending has been really good, too, Rakell said. Were scoring goals and just playing.It is an impressive turnaround for a team that refused to panic after stumbling in October.We had a lot of expectations coming into training camp, and we didnt meet any of them, Getzlaf said. We had a couple of meetings here and there, but you can only say so much. You have to be able to go out on the ice and do the things you need to do. We put ourselves so far behind the eight ball at the start of the year that every day was just about trying to build something and get better. Weve been able to do that as of late."}
{"text": "UNITED NATIONS   The United States and China reached an agreement to impose tougher sanctions against North Korea, in what appeared to be a diplomatic shift by Beijing regarding its intransigent ally.The proposed resolution is the product of intense negotiations between the two nations over the last seven weeks, since Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon it claimed was a hydrogen bomb. It was circulated to members of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, and diplomats said it could come up for a vote in the coming days.Diplomats said the fact that Washington and Beijing had agreed on a set of measures increased the international pressure on the North Koreans. In the past, after previous nuclear tests condemned by the Security Council, China agreed only to banning weapons transfers and limited sanctions against those linked to the nuclear program.Whether the proposed new sanctions will succeed in curtailing Pyongyangs nuclear ambitions remains to be seen. Past efforts to halt its nuclear program have not been fully carried out, nor have they prevented North Korea from pursuing a nuclear arsenal. Whether China would follow through on tougher sanctions was also a key question.United States officials declined, without explanation, to provide the text of the resolution.The proposed measures, according to a United States official, would ban the trade of conventional weapons, luxury goods like jet skis and Rolex watches, and aviation fuel to North Korea, which could effectively ground its national airline. It would also place prohibitions on dozens of new companies and individuals accused of trafficking in illicit nuclear material.In what may be the toughest proposed measure, all North Korean cargo entering or leaving a country must be inspected by that country.The mandatory cargo inspection applies to anything going to and from the D.P.R.K., according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks. If it is on your territory, in your ports or in your airports, theres a requirement to inspect cargo to and from the D.P.R.K., the official said, using the initials for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.In addition, 31 ships that have been known to traffic in illegal nuclear goods are to be banned from docking in any port. It is impossible to verify whether countries sending or receiving North Korean goods will carry out the inspections. However, they will be legally binding if the resolution is adopted.Significant loopholes remain. North Korea would still be able to buy oil and sell its coal and iron ore, as long as it is not being used to fund its nuclear weapons program  which would be difficult to prove. China, North Koreas main trading partner and diplomatic backer, is its main supplier of oil.The draft resolution would also prohibit North Korea from exporting gold, titanium and rare earth minerals. It would ban countries from sending any item to North Korea that could be used by the North Korean armed forces, like trucks that could be rejiggered for military purposes.Samantha Power, the United States ambassador, called the draft document a major upgrade to existing sanctions against North Korea, which are aimed mainly at those linked to the nuclear program. These sanctions if adopted would send an unambiguous and unyielding message to the D.P.R.K. regime  the world will not accept your proliferation, she said Thursday.The Chinese envoy to the United Nations, Liu Jieyi, declined to comment on the specifics of the draft on Thursday but said he hoped the council would reach a consensus. The resolution should pave the way for a negotiated solution down the road, not be a stonewall, he said.The new sanctions come as the United States is in talks with officials in Seoul about the possible deployment of an American missile-defense system in South Korea, a development Beijing strongly objects to. It also follows stepped-up United States sanctions against North Korea.Kelsey Davenport, a North Korea expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association, pointed out that even tough sanctions would not alone curtail Pyongyangs nuclear ambitions without what she called sustained diplomacy.Chinas agreement to support additional U.N. sanctions sends a strong message to North Korea that it cannot count on Beijing to shield it from the costs of flouting international law, she said. However, Chinas support for additional sanctions may not translate into the political will necessary in Beijing to enforce restrictions on the books. Without stringent enforcement, North Koreas complex illicit trafficking networks will continue undeterred.Reuters quoted the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, as saying, We hope and believe this new resolution can help effectively constrain North Korea from further developing its nuclear missile program. The draft contains language that notes the grave hardships that North Korean citizens are subjected to, but says nothing about human rights abuses that have been painstakingly documented by a United Nations Commission of Inquiry.John Sifton, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, described Pyongyangs nuclear program as inextricably linked to its record of repression, including forced labor and torture. Sanctioning North Koreas nuclear proliferation should go hand in hand with condemning the devastating human rights abuses that persist on a massive scale across the country, he said."}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders, looking to shore up his credentials on foreign policy, is seeking advice from a patchwork of experts, including Lawrence Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and who has speculated that Israel might have carried out chemical attacks in Syria.Mr. Wilkerson, a former Army colonel who has become an ardent critic of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, speculated about Israels possible role in a May 2013 interview with Cenk Uygur of Current TV.This couldve been an Israeli false-flag operation, it couldve been an opposition in Syria, he added, saying that the attacks also could have been carried out by Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president. (The United States believes the Syrian government was in fact behind the chemical attacks.)But we certainly dont know with the evidence weve been given, he added. And what Im hearing from the intelligence community is that that evidence is really flaky.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Wilkerson was not remorseful about suggesting that Israel might have played a role in the attacks. But he said he was merely listing those who could have played a part, and wasnt trying to fan flames against Israel.I was just suggesting all the different people that could have been involved at a time when speculation was rampant, said Mr. Wilkerson, adding that there was still some debate within the intelligence community about exactly what took place.Demonstrating an ability to show foreign policy depth has been a challenge for Mr. Sanders, who has promised to roll out a list of advisers on the national security front.An aide to Mr. Sanders did not respond to a request for comment on Friday."}

{"text": "A highly regarded dean at the flagship campus of the University of Texas announced this week that he was leaving the school in part because of his concerns over a new state law allowing people to carry concealed firearms in classrooms and other buildings on public college campuses.Frederick Steiner, the dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin, said on Thursday that he would leave on July 1 to take a job as the dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. He has led the architecture school in Austin for 15 years.His decision to leave a program he helped steer to national prominence underscored concerns expressed by Gregory L. Fenves, the president of University of Texas at Austin, that the law would harm the schools ability to attract and retain top students and faculty.I have significant concerns about how the law will affect our ability to recruit and retain faculty members and students, Dr. Fenves wrote in a letter to the chancellor of the University of Texas System, William H. McRaven, on Feb. 17.Dr. Fenves called the departure of Dr. Steiner a big loss for the university in an email to the campus community on Thursday. A spokesman, Gary Susswein, said the administration did not know that the new law played a role in Dr. Steiners decision when the statement was issued, and he declined to comment on the matter on Friday.Many factors contributed to the decision to leave, Dr. Steiner said on Friday, but two in particular tipped the scales: a steady decrease over the years in funding for public universities, and the campus carry law, which will go into effect on Aug. 1.I dont think its a very good law just by its very nature, Dr. Steiner said. He said he grew up hunting in a family that included police officers, F.B.I. agents and Marines, so I am not a complete stranger to firearms.The way I was brought up, there is a place for them, an appropriate place, and that was for hunting, he said. There are all kinds of very stressful situations at a university, and I cant conceive of how someone would think that introducing a firearm into that context would be constructive in any way.The law, Senate Bill 11, was signed in June by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican. It allows licensed gun owners to carry a concealed weapon at the states public universities but grants administrators some leeway to regulate them.Private universities remain free to ban concealed weapons, and many of the largest and most prestigious have done so, including Baylor, Rice and Southern Methodist.In his letter to the chancellor, Dr. Fenves wrote that he would have banned concealed weapons, too, if the law had given him that option. He said he opposed campus carry, calling it a violation of the universitys ethos of inquiry, free speech and debate.In addition to the support it has from Republican lawmakers, carrying concealed weapons on campus is an issue fervently supported by a national group called Students for Concealed Carry, which cheered the laws passage and sharply criticized the university for its efforts to impose some limits.In particular, the group has condemned a campus policy allowing university employees to ban guns from their offices and another requiring semiautomatic handguns to be carried without ammunition in the firing chamber. The group said last week it would challenge the policy in court.People with a license for a concealed weapon have been able to carry firearms on campus, but not inside buildings, for 20 years, Dr. Fenves said in a statement posted online, and the law does not allow open carry on campus. He said the university estimated that less than 1 percent of students have a concealed weapons license.Nevertheless, he said the parents of many current and prospective students had contacted him to express concern that concealed weapons would soon be allowed in classrooms and other buildings.Faculty members have expressed alarm over the law as well. At a recent meeting at the School of Architecture, the professors voted unanimously to express their opposition to concealed weapons on campus, Dr. Steiner said.Students have stopped me in the hallways and asked what we are going to do to oppose the law, he said. And I tell them, We cant do anything, its the law. Perhaps the most vexing part of the law, Dr. Steiner said, was that it created an environment where administrators like himself felt responsible for enforcing a law they see as detrimental to students and colleagues."}
{"text": "Marco Rubio has not won a state, a fact that worries allies and pleases skeptics who mock his chances to win the Republican presidential nomination.It doesnt even sound as if the Rubio team knows when it will win one.Can this strategy really work? Could he really lose every state on Super Tuesday and still stand a chance of becoming the nominee?The delegate math says yes. No, it wouldnt be optimal for Mr. Rubio to lose all 12 contests on March 1, Super Tuesday. His chances of amassing an outright majority of delegates, and becoming the presumptive nominee before the convention, would be quite low. But he would still have a real chance to take a clear delegate lead over Donald Trump, and win the nomination.That window closes March 15. On that day a slew of big winner-take-all states will vote. If Mr. Rubio cant hold his own in those states  Illinois, Ohio, Florida, Missouri and North Carolina  it will become extremely difficult for him to finish the primary season with a lead in pledged delegates. His more realistic strategy then would be to deny Mr. Trump a majority and hope to win at a contested convention.So, yes, the delegate math works. The problem for Mr. Rubio isnt the math; its winning even the small number of states needed to pull it off.The Republican delegate rules, relative to those for the Democrats, are biased toward candidates who win. That makes it very easy to imagine how Mr. Trump could sweep to the nomination over a divided field.But thats not so true before March 15, when party rules prevent states from apportioning their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. Most states wound up splitting their delegates, awarding a pool of at-large delegates proportionally by the percentage of the vote and awarding other delegates to the candidates who lead in each congressional district.As a result, it will be difficult on Super Tuesday for Mr. Trump to amass a significant majority of delegates if the other two major candidates  Mr. Rubio and Ted Cruz  clear the thresholds (at highest 20 percent) for earning proportional delegates. It seemed quite possible a few weeks ago that Mr. Trump could build a big lead on Super Tuesday, but Jeb Bushs exit from the race and the big bump in Mr. Rubios poll numbers make it far less likely that Mr. Trump can pull that off.Imagine, for a moment, that the candidates fare about as well on Super Tuesday as they have through the first four contests. Given the types of states in play on Super Tuesday, perhaps that yields something like a 34-25-25 percent split between Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz.In this scenario, Mr. Trump claims a clear edge in delegate accumulation but not a majority. He gets 279 delegates, or just 44 percent of the delegates at stake, while Mr. Rubio receives 164 delegates.Its a respectable tally for Mr. Rubio, even though he loses every state. Thats because he clears 20 percent in every state. That scenario includes Texas, where the most delegates are at stake on Super Tuesday and where Mr. Rubio is in the most danger of missing the delegate threshold because of Mr. Cruzs home-state popularity. For anyone counting delegates, whether Mr. Rubio reaches 20 percent in Texas is a lot more important than anything else.Supposing that Mr. Rubio clears all of these thresholds, he has two big objectives: beating Mr. Cruz in the South, in hopes of driving him from the race, and winning a state or two. His schedule reflects this strategy. Hes visiting a host of Southern states where Mr. Cruz is hoping to do well, and where delegate thresholds still pose some risk to his ability to deny Mr. Trump a majority of delegates. Hes spending all of Sunday in Virginia, which should be one of his best states because of its mix of religious and well-educated voters. Virginia is a clear momentum play (the lift that could come from finally winning); the state uses a purely proportional delegate system, so there are fewer delegates to be gained there than by winning just about anywhere else. Minnesota would seem to be another good option for Mr. Rubio.The deficit for Mr. Rubio after Super Tuesday in this scenario  181 over all and 115 from Super Tuesday  would not be especially big. If Mr. Rubio won Florida  a winner-take-all state worth 99 delegates  it could balance out nearly all losses from Super Tuesday.But for the same reason Mr. Rubio can erase so much damage by winning in Florida on March 15, he cant afford to lose on March 15 either.Ohio and Florida will award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. Missouri will award its delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district, and Illinois isnt much different. North Carolina, on the other hand, awards its delegates proportionally. It figures less prominently in the delegate math and as a result the candidates are unlikely to spend money there on television advertisements or campaign stops.If Mr. Trump swept the day in the same way he is expected to sweep Super Tuesday, he would net nearly three times as many delegates as he would on Super Tuesday, defeating Mr. Rubio, 282 delegates to 40. For Mr. Rubio, winning Florida would make Mr. Trumps advantage a more manageable 183 to 139, but his hole would start looking pretty deep.With that sort of a deficit, Mr. Rubios chances of winning a majority of delegates would all but evaporate.Even if Mr. Rubio swept on March 15 and started doing as well as Mitt Romney did at that stage in 2012, he would barely edge ahead of Mr. Trump in the pledged delegate count. And of course, there would be plenty of reason to question whether Mr. Rubio could really do so well after losing so many states to that point.Winning by March 15 is what matters for Mr. Rubio, not the math.Its not going to be easy. The Republican establishment is flocking to him, but the escalating pace of the primary season makes it harder for him to take advantage of growing support from the party. Theres not much time for him to raise money, and whatever he does raise will be spread fairly thin.The party isnt fully unified either, with Mr. Cruz and particularly John Kasich remaining in the race. Mr. Trump holds between 30 and 40 percent of the vote, most national surveys say, so it is very difficult for Mr. Rubio to overtake him when votes are siphoned off by another candidate. If Mr. Kasich remains in the race, his home state of Ohio will be very difficult for Mr. Rubio to win.Theres a final issue: Some big winner-take-all and winner-take-most states arent necessarily favorable ground for him.Mr. Trump has tended to fare best with less educated and less religious voters. Theres also evidence he does better in places with a larger nonwhite population. Florida and Ohio fit the bill. And separately New Jersey also shapes up well for him later in the calendar. Theyre all projected to be above-average states for Mr. Trump based on the results so far (though obviously this can change, and it doesnt account for a potential home-state edge for Mr. Rubio in Florida and Mr. Kasich in Ohio).New Quinnipiac surveys show Mr. Trump ahead in Ohio and Florida.But there is one important bit of good news for Mr. Rubio: the struggles of Ted Cruz. He has finished third in two consecutive contests where he had hoped to perform well. He is in danger of being shut out on Super Tuesday; he could even lose his home state, Texas. Polls show him falling behind Mr. Rubio in other Southern states like Georgia and Oklahoma.The Cruz campaign has always been clear that it is counting on a strong showing on Super Tuesday, and Mr. Cruzs path to the nomination would look exceptionally bleak if he fared as poorly on March 1 as he did in South Carolina and Nevada. It could be enough to force him from the race. Mr. Kasichs play is less clear, but he could quit if he finishes poorly in Michigan on March 8.If Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich exited, it would give Mr. Rubio the chance to build a coalition of ideologically consistent conservative voters and more mainstream, well-educated conservatives. The onset of a real one-on-one race would pose a challenge to Mr. Trump, who would finally be forced to build a majority coalition.So far, more G.O.P. voters tell pollsters they would definitely oppose Mr. Trump than currently support him, which at least raises the possibility that Mr. Rubio could prevail in a one-on-one fight. Polls pitting the two against each other have shown a tight race or even a lead for Mr. Rubio.Mr. Trump would also have to overcome a barrage of negative television advertisements  something he hasnt had to face very much of so far.Whether Mr. Rubio could in fact consolidate the preponderance of Mr. Kasich or Mr. Cruzs supporters is hard to say.But whether it happens before March 15 could easily decide the outcome of the Republican race."}
{"text": "An accounting fraud case at a once-prominent New York law firm that captured front-page headlines in 2014 is now looking more ordinary.On Friday, a New York State Supreme Court judge threw out all the grand larceny charges against the two remaining defendants stemming from the collapse of the law firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf, in 2012.The decision means prosecutors intend to go to trial this year against the two, Joel Sanders and Stephen DiCarmine, with just a few criminal charges  none of them the most serious offenses originally charged by prosecutors in Manhattan nearly two years ago.We are very gratified by the courts decision, said Andrew J. Frisch, a lawyer for Mr. Sanders.The latest whittling down of the criminal case is another blow to Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, in one of the most notable white-collar cases filed by his office.Earlier this year, Mr. Vance agreed to deferred prosecution deals to dismiss eventually the charges against two of the original four defendants, including Steven H. Davis, the former chairman of Dewey.Last year, a jury acquitted Mr. Davis, Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders on a number of low-level criminal charges before deadlocking on dozens of other charges after a six-month trial in Lower Manhattan. The trial judge, Robert M. Stolz, declared a mistrial after the jury had deliberated for 21 days.Afterward, prosecutors dismissed many of the original charges against the three men.The fourth defendant, Zachary Warren, a low-level employee who has since become a lawyer, recently reached a deferred prosecution agreement just a month before he was scheduled to go on trial.Austin V. Campriello, a lawyer for Mr. DiCarmine, the former executive director of Dewey, said he hoped prosecutors would consider offering a deferred prosecution agreement to his client after reassessing what remains of the case.Speaking outside the courtroom, Mr. Campriello said Mr. Vances prosecutorial team needed to re-examine the case because the judge has dismissed the heart of the peoples case.Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, had no comment on Justice Stolzs decision.In March 2014, when prosecutors announced a 106-count indictment in the case, Mr. Vance said the four original defendants had helped orchestrate a nearly four-year scheme to manipulate the law firms books. The men, he said, were trying to keep the law firm afloat during the financial crisis, in the process defrauding bank lenders and institutional investors in a debt offering.The indictment painted a portrait of a law firm run like a criminal enterprise. Mr. Vance said those at the top of Dewey had directed employees to hide the firms true financial condition from creditors, investors, auditors and even partners of the firm.Two years later, the guts of the prosecutions case have been reduced to six counts against Mr. Sanders, the firms former chief financial officer, and Mr. DiCarmine.Justice Stolz, in a ruling from the bench, said he was dismissing the 15 grand larceny charges because no reasonable jury would be able to convict Mr. Sanders or Mr. DiCarmine on them.The judge, however, denied the defendants motion to dismiss the still pending conspiracy, scheme to defraud and securities fraud charges.A conviction on any one of the grand larceny charges could have resulted in a sentence ranging from eight and a third years in prison to 25 years. A conviction carries a mandatory prison sentence of one year.By contrast, the maximum sentence on the scheme to defraud charge could result in a sentence of up to four years in prison. But a judge is not required to impose a prison sentence as part of the punishment.Even before the judge tossed out the grand larceny charges, prosecutors said a second trial would be shorter and simpler than the first.In interviews after the trial, a number of jurors said prosecutors had made the case too complex by bringing too many charges and letting the proceedings stretch through the summer.Seven former Dewey employees, most of them low-level workers who had pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to manipulate the firms finances, testified at the first trial. It is not known if prosecutors will call them as witnesses again. Many of them are not expected to receive prison time.The star witness at the first trial was Francis J. Canellas, the firms former finance director, who told the jury that the plan to manipulate the financial books and records of Dewey was first discussed over steak dinner at Del Friscos in Midtown Manhattan in late December 2008. Mr. Canellas, who pleaded guilty to a single count of grand larceny in return for a more lenient sentence, testified that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Warren attended that dinner.On Monday, lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed its own fraud lawsuit against several former Dewey executives, told a federal judge that the S.E.C. had reached a partial settlement with Mr. Canellas in that litigation."}
{"text": "The Mariinsky Ballet has been variously known as the wellspring of ballet classicism and the finest home of ballet romanticism. On Thursday, however, it became the celebrant of sensationalist kitsch in the triple bill that opened its four-program season, A Tribute to Maya Plisetskaya, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The evening was bizarre in several ways.The programs only two live performances were Alberto Alonsos Carmen Suite (1967), with Diana Vishneva as Carmen, and Michel Fokines The Dying Swan (1905), with Uliana Lopatkina as the swan. Insultingly, the Brooklyn Academy program did not name any of the several dancers who appeared with Ms. Vishneva in Carmen. (They were Ivan Oskorbin, Alexander Sergeev, Roman Belyakov and Aleksandra Iosifidi.) Both those ballets were associated with Plisetskaya, the prima ballerina not of the Mariinsky but of the Bolshoi; her husband, Rodion Shchedrin, was responsible for the tawdry arrangement of the Bizet music for Carmen.There followed a spotty film of Plisetskaya dancing Maurice Bjarts Bolero (1961), with Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra providing live accompaniment (the Ravel Bolero) with predictably imperfect timing. Then Ms. Vishneva and Ms. Lopatkina and two of the three lead male dancers from Carmen briefly hailed an image of Plisetskaya and, once it had vanished, took curtain calls with Mr. Gergiev.What an abysmal program this was! The legend of Fokines Dying Swan was made above all by Anna Pavlova (1881-1931), whose intense pathos can still be seen on film. Plisetskaya, with her steely bravado, was the opposite, a deathless swan of virtuoso arm-ripplings (the critic Edwin Denby spoke of Eel Lake). She seldom danced the solo less than twice in succession; I recall the joyous way she basked in the applause  she even became sexy  more fondly than I recall her dancing. Ms. Lopatkinas performance was schematic, cold, forgettable.Still, this was the evenings best choreography. Bjarts Bolero is a tacky rabble-rouser in which a star dancer, building a handful of gestures and steps in a crescendo, gradually inflames the corps seated around the table on which she (or he) stands.When I first watched the Bjart company dance it in 1980, the star was Jorge Donn, surrounded by other men whom his dancing slowly whipped up into a frenzy of steamy desire; the main event was his eyeliner, which may be described as epic. (The star-corps-table idea goes back to the 1928 premiere of Ravels score, when the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska put Ida Rubinstein on the table; one of the young men around her was the young Frederick Ashton. A movie adaptation occurs with Carole Lombard and George Raft in the 1934 movie Bolero.)Plisetskayas whole career was based on taking thin, kitsch choreography and transcending it. (This has been true of the Bolshoi Ballet for decades. The Mariinsky, much less talented in selling trash choreography, instead exemplified lyrical purity in the romantic and classical heritage ballets.) The film shows how unstoppably she fanned the Bolero flame, building it from bleak austerity to cruel delight.I recall a TV broadcast of Carmen Suite in which, despite the choreographys atrocious antimusicality, she did the same. She epitomized the freedom upon which Bizets Carmen insists. Ms. Vishneva, physically so luscious, is no Carmen: Shes just a death-devoted Lorelei. The Alonso ballet is a surreal distortion of the story (Death is another ballerina). Bizets music abounds in rhythmic play; the choreography doesnt and often makes its heavy effects off the beat. Why is the Mariinsky wasting itself on such twaddle?"}
{"text": "LONDON  The London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Brse, which announced this week that they were in merger talks, said on Friday that the combined company would most likely be based in London and be led by the German exchanges top executive.The all-stock deal would unite two of the biggest European exchange operators and create a new giant in an industry that has rapidly consolidated. The companies announced on Tuesday that they were in discussions regarding a merger of equals.The transaction would also allow London, which has served as a financial gateway to Europe, to maintain economic ties to the Continent, even as Britons are set to vote in June on whether to leave the European Union.On Friday, the companies said any potential merger would not be conditioned on the outcome of the June 23 referendum, but a decision by Britain to leave the European Union could well affect the volume or nature of the business conducted in the different financial centers served by the combined group.The talks came four years after Deutsche Brse dropped plans to merge with the parent of the New York Stock Exchange after European antitrust regulators threatened to block the deal. It is also the third time since 2000 that the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Brse have considered a tie-up.Under the terms of the proposed merger disclosed on Tuesday, shareholders in the London Stock Exchange would receive 0.4421 of a new share in the combined company for every share of the London Stock Exchange they own. Their counterparts at Deutsche Brse would receive one share of the new company for each of their shares, giving them a 54.4 percent stake in the united market operator.Under the deal being contemplated, the combined company would be based in Britain and maintain headquarters in London and Frankfurt, the home of the Deutsche Brse. It would list its stock in London and Frankfurt.Carsten Kengeter, the Deutsche Brse chief executive, would serve as the chief executive of the combined company, and Donald Brydon, the London Stock Exchange chairman, would be its chairman. The combined companys board of directors would have equal representation from both exchanges.Xavier Rolet would step down from his role as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.Xavier has been the architect of L.S.E.G.s considerable value creation and has offered to retire in order to ensure the successful creation of the new group, Mr. Brydon said on Friday. The companys board of directors is indebted to Xavier for this action which is consistent with his focus on putting the interests of shareholders and clients first.The companies said they had initiated discussions about a potential merger with their primary regulators, as well as the governments of Britain, France, Germany and Italy. The London Stock Exchange Group also operates the Borsa Italiana in Milan.The parties are proceeding on the basis that existing regulatory and political structures remain in place, the companies said."}
{"text": "The freaked-out entrance line of the first song of the first Black Sabbath album, sung by Ozzy Osbourne over the guitarist Tony Iommis creepy-crawly interval of a tritone, is: What is this that stands before me?When Mr. Osbourne, 67, sang the words on Thursday night, this was a full house at Madison Square Garden, taking part in the old and familiar, possibly for the last time. When he wrote it in 1969, based on a story told to him by the bands bassist, Geezer Butler, it was a disturbing intruder: a vision of a black shape that appeared to Mr. Butler after looking at what he has described in one interview as an old 16th-century book of black magic  I think it was written in Latin. (It might have been the Malleus Maleficarum, a study on the practice and prosecution of witchcraft, and a book that has intrigued later generations of metalheads.)Mr. Osbourne delivered the line a few minutes into the concert, the first of two New York stops of a tour advertised as the bands finale, called The End. And then he executed a giant, megafriendly, Julia Roberts-level smile. He held it for a few long beats, as if to say: Mark what Im doing here. A few songs later, as the band started the hypnotic riffs of Into the Void  serious, superfine, a gift  Mr. Osbourne urged: Come on! Lets have a party tonight, New York-style!This is the thing about Black Sabbath. Dread and fear are always the same. A seriously good time is always different. The thin surface of Sabbath is dread and fear, and everything underneath, at best, is a seriously good time: deluxe, grooving, sensuous. This is why you can see Black Sabbath play a set much like the other ones it has been playing during the reunion stage of its career and still be tuned up by it.Black Sabbath, from Birmingham, England, was foundational for metal, but the music it played on Thursday  all of it recorded between 1969 and 1976  is full of scales related to the blues, which has its own long tradition of despair masking joy. That joy on Thursday was in sound and feeling. You could hear the band in giant, clear, present detail, unusual for the Garden: Mr. Iommis riffs and solos in thick, matte-finish tone, arriving with restraint and precision; Mr. Butlers grainy bass, pushed up high in the mix; Mr. Osbournes thin, strange howl, basically in tune through the evening; and the doomy drumming, by Tommy Clufetos.Mr. Osbourne is still the bands floppy figurehead, moving in a quickstep toddle across the stage, stooping into the microphone. Mr. Iommi and Mr. Butler are the bands color and shape.But lets talk about Mr. Clufetos for a minute. He is the band member whos not part of the original crew, about 30 years younger than the others. He isnt new  you may have seen him with the group on its last go-round, the reunion tour of 2013 and 2014. His playing emphasizes and celebrates the artful, fully embodied tempo-dragging in these old songs, once played by Bill Ward. (The band has had a complicated relationship with Mr. Ward since 2012, because of contractual and other issues.)Mr. Clufetoss tempos on Thursday werent fake-slow or dramatically slow. They were slow by disposition. At best  certainly Into the Void, Hand of Doom, Children of the Grave  they helped make the music sexily expand and breathe and bend. And his long drum solo in the middle of the concert, leading out of Rat Salad and into Iron Man, allowed hundreds of graying men to avail themselves of a bathroom break with dignity and leisure. (Though many remained, following the arc of the solo.)Black Sabbath knows its audience well, and seems to be letting go  if it is really letting go; the final concert is scheduled for the Ak-Chin Pavilion in Phoenix on Sept. 21  in an exemplary way. A little under two hours long, the concert was not glib or draggy or overloaded with the bands own stature. Invitations to joy, yes. Balloons, speeches, no. It was large, clear, succinct and close to the ground."}

{"text": "Antonin Scalias empty Supreme Court seat has cost Dow Chemical $835 million.That is how much the chemical company is paying in a decade-old lawsuit that was heading to the top court. Dow decided the death of Justice Scalia, a conservative judge, changed the balance of the suit and settled. It is a reminder that the gridlocked politics surrounding the Supreme Court have real-world effects.Dows decision puts to rest the urethane price-fixing suit. Dow thought it had a good shot at setting aside a lower courts $1.06 billion award to the plaintiffs on the grounds that it violated class-action law.Justice Scalias death threw a wrench into this calculation, however. Not only did Dow cite two cases with rulings written by Justice Scalia in its arguments to the Supreme Court, but a split vote  now possible with four conservative judges and four liberals  means lower court decisions stand.Perhaps Dow would have had to change its thinking and settle the case even if Washington was running smoothly. A liberal-leaning addition to the Supreme Court, quickly appointed, could have meant a majority of justices would support the earlier award to the plaintiffs.But the stalemate on the empty seat may endure for more than a year because of the standoff in Congress. Republican lawmakers are saying that they will not even consider any nominee put forward by President Obama to succeed Justice Scalia, and the chosen candidate would need the Senates approval. No wonder Dow also referred to rising political uncertainties along with the heightened risk of an unfavorable outcome.Its easy to see the fight over Justice Scalias spot as purely political high drama. But Dows decision shows that it matters well beyond the halls of Congress and the Supreme Court. Its one more uncertainty weighing down businesses and citizens seeking justice."}
{"text": "Two Republican ex-lawmakers were charged Friday with felony misconduct in office after their affair snowballed into a political scandal when one of them concocted a bizarre cover story. Attorney General Bill Schuette said former State Representative Todd Courser faces three counts of misconduct in office, felonies that are each punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr. Courser was also charged with perjury for lying to lawmakers under oath, a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Former Representative Cindy Gamrat faces two charges of misconduct. One of the misconduct charges against Mr. Courser alleges that he ordered a staff member to send an email to Republican activists falsely stating that he had been caught with a male prostitute. The email was intended to make his affair with Ms. Gamrat appear less believable and allow Mr. Courser to claim he had been blackmailed. The most serious charge of perjury is unrelated to the sex scandal. It alleges that he lied under oath about authorizing staff to forge his signature. Ms. Gamrat is charged with lying to investigators and also for authorizing a staffer to forge her signature on proposed legislation."}

{"text": "When a building has been around for a couple of hundred years, it is not uncommon to hear tales of ghosts inhabiting the premises. Such is the case with Abigails Grille and Wine Bar in Simsbury, in a former tavern that dates to 1803, atop the foundation of a stagecoach stop built in 1780.The story is that Abigail Pettibone, wife of the original owner, was decapitated by her husband, Markus Lehofer, the restaurants general manager, said. And shes been haunting the place ever since.With numerous carriage lanterns providing a welcoming glow outside and walls of coffered walnut and several fireplaces projecting warmth within, there is nothing sepulchral about Abigails. On the contrary, reasonable pricing  especially a $25 three-course prix fixe menu (Sunday through Tuesday) and half-off happy hours (weekdays)  make the grille a lively spot for a broad cross section of the local population.As you might expect of a place with the word grille in its name, Abigails (one of five dining establishments in the Mill Restaurant Group) emphasizes grilled meats, particularly cuts of filet mignon, New York strip and rib-eye steaks paired with any of five classic sauces or reductions. I opted instead for a bone-in Gorgonzola pork chop, an inch-thick, slightly scorched slab that was perfectly cooked: pale pink at the center and oh so tender. Juicy and delicious as that chop was, its sauce  an intensely rich cranberry-cognac reduction  elevated it still higher.That holds true of the dense, savory demiglace that accompanied the rack of lamb. Here, too, the lamb, consisting of an impressive array of nine rib bones attached to surprisingly lean meat, was done exactly as ordered  rare, in this case. Its pistachio-pumpkin crust was less a dusting than an impasto of nuts and, more subtly, sweet pumpkin pulp, making for a surprisingly harmonious complement to the dish.Abigails swordfish gets the grilled treatment, too, though its oak wood smoking was undetectable. The salutary effect of that light broiling was a piece of fish that retained more moisture than is common for swordfish. Also on the plate was a side of Israeli couscous, a delightful mlange of tomato, bits of zucchini, garlic and just a hint of cream.Abigails strengths extend beyond the grill to other preparations, as well. Two salads of note were winter kale and heirloom beets. The first, composed of lightly dressed green and red leaves, brought together a pleasing crunch (from toasted pepitas), creamy saltiness (due to chunks of Roquefort), and sweet fruitiness (thanks to raisins). As for the beets (slices of red and orange), an artful arrangement of arugula, candied walnuts, Laura Chenel goat cheese, shaved red onion and slivers of fennel made them taste as great as they looked.I also appreciated an appetizer of French Brie, as much for its restraint  just single slices melted onto three walnut-cranberry toasts  as for the flavorful interaction of the tomato marmalade (accented with citrus) and micro basil that completed the dish. Portobello cups  baby bella caps stuffed with sausage and bread crumbs  involved more cheese, Cheddar melted into a fondue sauce (with a dash of white wine) that smothered the mushrooms and served as a fine counterpoint to the fennel-seasoned meat.On the menu, roasted eggplant Napolitan evoked a tidy layering of ingredients (spinach, mushrooms, cheese, sun-dried tomatoes), but was instead an unsightly mound. Still, despite its appearance and the disappointment of finding that the eggplant had been breaded and fried, I quite enjoyed this appetizer, largely because of its excellent marinara and the high quality of the buffalo mozzarella oozing through it. The Mediterranean calamari fritti, a creative assemblage of olives, artichoke hearts, feta, capers and cherry peppers, yielded a marvelous marriage of flavors, but undermined the squids crispiness. Perhaps grilling, rather than deep-frying, could improve upon that.Of a half-dozen house-made pastas, I heartily recommend the bow ties with Maine lobster, which was heavy on claw and arm meat, light on vodka sauce, and just right in its application of tomatoes, cheese and asparagus. Pan-seared day boat scallops, while nicely undercooked, would have rated higher had its overly cheesy bed of risotto (also dense with butter) been less cloying.Most desserts were well made and worth sampling. They included tiramis (moist, with appropriate overtones of mocha and mascarpone) and vanilla bean crme brle. It is the chocolate chip croissant bread pudding, however, that continues to haunt me. Deceptively decadent in its dark chocolate melting into buttery chunks of croissant, surrounded by vanilla bean custard, the specter of this dessert has me longing to return to Abigails."}
{"text": "Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasnt sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasnt a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together, she told me. She thought about various opportunities  Internet companies, a Ph.D. program  but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didnt turn out that way. There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups, Rozovsky told me. It wasnt like that for me.Instead, Rozovskys study group was a source of stress. I always felt like I had to prove myself, she said. The teams dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one anothers ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other, Rozovsky told me. I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for case competitions, contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasnt all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, we had lots of crazy ideas, Rozovsky said.One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yales campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but we all felt like we could say anything to each other, Rozovsky told me. No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them. Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a microgym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition. (The microgym  with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills  still exists.)Rozovskys study group dissolved in her second semester (it was up to the students whether they wanted to continue). Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale.It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the teams members got along better as a group than as individual friends.I couldnt figure out why things had turned out so different, Rozovsky told me. It didnt seem like it had to happen that way.Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves. Were living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity, says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information. All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us dont even notice, and figure out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.Yet many of todays most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers  a practice known as employee performance optimization  isnt enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employees day is spent communicating with colleagues.In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.Five years ago, Google  one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity  became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees lives. Googles People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).The companys top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like Its better to put introverts together, said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Googles People Analytics division, or Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work. But, Dubey went on, it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative  code-named Project Aristotle  to study hundreds of Googles teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the companys best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study peoples habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.Project Aristotles researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a teams success.No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns  or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. We looked at 180 teams from all over the company, Dubey said. We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The who part of the equation didnt seem to matter.Some groups that were ranked among Googles most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. At Google, were good at finding patterns, Dubey said. There werent strong patterns here.As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as group norms. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals  they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently  but when they gather, the groups norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.Project Aristotles researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an unwritten rule or when they explained certain things as part of the teams culture. Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their groups sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Googles teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Googles research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates? Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? The data didnt offer clear verdicts. In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms, Rozovsky and her colleagues wondered, were the ones that successful teams shared?Imagine you have been invited to join one of two groups.Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.Team B is different. Its evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one anothers thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesnt actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.Which group would you rather join?In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals, the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. We have used the statistical approach they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups. Put differently, the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I.Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the groups score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldnt fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the good teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a groups collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly, said Anita Woolley, the studys lead author. Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyones relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking. On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well, Woolley said. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.Second, the good teams all had high average social sensitivity  a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of peoples eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling  an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolleys experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the groups norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. Theres a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and theres little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one anothers moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity as aspects of whats known as psychological safety  a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. Psychological safety is a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up, Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.When Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. One engineer, for instance, had told researchers that his team leader was direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks. That team, researchers estimated, was among Googles accomplished groups. By contrast, another engineer had told the researchers that his team leader has poor emotional control. He added: He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control. I would hate to be driving with him being in the passenger seat, because he would keep trying to grab the steering wheel and crash the car. That team, researchers presumed, did not perform well.Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale, Rozovsky said. Id been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group. Rozovskys study group at Yale was draining because the norms  the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique  put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team  enthusiasm for one anothers ideas, joking around and having fun  allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well  like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Googles data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.We had to get people to establish psychologically safe environments, Rozovsky told me. But it wasnt clear how to do that. People here are really busy, she said. We needed clear guidelines.However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement. You can tell people to take turns during a conversation and to listen to one another more. You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.Rozovsky and her colleagues had figured out which norms were most critical. Now they had to find a way to make communication and empathy  the building blocks of forging real connections  into an algorithm they could easily scale.In late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Googles 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. They hadnt yet figured out how to make psychological safety easy, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.After Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the companys websites or servers go down.I might be the luckiest individual on earth, Sakaguchi told me. Im not really an engineer. I didnt study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am. But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google. He and his wife, a teacher, have a home in San Francisco and a weekend house in the Sonoma Valley wine country. Most days, I feel like Ive won the lottery, he said.Sakaguchi was particularly interested in Project Aristotle because the team he previously oversaw at Google hadnt jelled particularly well. There was one senior engineer who would just talk and talk, and everyone was scared to disagree with him, Sakaguchi said. The hardest part was that everyone liked this guy outside the group setting, but whenever they got together as a team, something happened that made the culture go wrong.Sakaguchi had recently become the manager of a new team, and he wanted to make sure things went better this time. So he asked researchers at Project Aristotle if they could help. They provided him with a survey to gauge the groups norms.When Sakaguchi asked his new team to participate, he was greeted with skepticism. It seemed like a total waste of time, said Sean Laurent, an engineer. But Matt was our new boss, and he was really into this questionnaire, and so we said, Sure, well do it, whatever.The team completed the survey, and a few weeks later, Sakaguchi received the results. He was surprised by what they revealed. He thought of the team as a strong unit. But the results indicated there were weaknesses: When asked to rate whether the role of the team was clearly understood and whether their work had impact, members of the team gave middling to poor scores. These responses troubled Sakaguchi, because he hadnt picked up on this discontent. He wanted everyone to feel fulfilled by their work. He asked the team to gather, off site, to discuss the surveys results. He began by asking everyone to share something personal about themselves. He went first.I think one of the things most people dont know about me, he told the group, is that I have Stage 4 cancer. In 2001, he said, a doctor discovered a tumor in his kidney. By the time the cancer was detected, it had spread to his spine. For nearly half a decade, it had grown slowly as he underwent treatment while working at Google. Recently, however, doctors had found a new, worrisome spot on a scan of his liver. That was far more serious, he explained.No one knew what to say. The team had been working with Sakaguchi for 10 months. They all liked him, just as they all liked one another. No one suspected that he was dealing with anything like this.To have Matt stand there and tell us that hes sick and hes not going to get better and, you know, what that means, Laurent said. It was a really hard, really special moment.After Sakaguchi spoke, another teammate stood and described some health issues of her own. Then another discussed a difficult breakup. Eventually, the team shifted its focus to the survey. They found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances. They agreed to adopt some new norms: From now on, Sakaguchi would make an extra effort to let the team members know how their work fit into Googles larger mission; they agreed to try harder to notice when someone on the team was feeling excluded or down.There was nothing in the survey that instructed Sakaguchi to share his illness with the group. There was nothing in Project Aristotles research that said that getting people to open up about their struggles was critical to discussing a groups norms. But to Sakaguchi, it made sense that psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. The behaviors that create psychological safety  conversational turn-taking and empathy  are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.I think, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life, Laurent told me. But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I cant be open and honest at work, then Im not really living, am I?What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a work face when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel psychologically safe, we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We cant be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.Which isnt to say that a team needs an ailing manager to come together. Any group can become Team B. Sakaguchis experiences underscore a core lesson of Googles research into teamwork: By adopting the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel. Googlers love data, Sakaguchi told me. But its not only Google that loves numbers, or Silicon Valley that shies away from emotional conversations. Most workplaces do. By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about, Sakaguchi told me. Its easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.Sakaguchi knows that the spread of his cancer means he may not have much time left. His wife has asked him why he doesnt quit Google. At some point, he probably will. But right now, helping his team succeed is the most meaningful work Ive ever done, he told me. He encourages the group to think about the way work and life mesh. Part of that, he says, is recognizing how fulfilling work can be. Project Aristotle proves how much a great team matters, he said. Why would I walk away from that? Why wouldnt I spend time with people who care about me?The technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the worlds dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, todays winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterdays conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.The paradox, of course, is that Googles intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.The fact that these insights arent wholly original doesnt mean Googles contributions arent valuable. In fact, in some ways, the employee performance optimization movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb. Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention, Rozovsky told me. Dont underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, its sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences  like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel  that cant really be optimized. Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team. We were in a meeting where I made a mistake, Rozovsky told me. She sent out a note afterward explaining how she was going to remedy the problem. I got an email back from a team member that said, Ouch, she recalled. It was like a punch to the gut. I was already upset about making this mistake, and this note totally played on my insecurities.If this had happened earlier in Rozovskys life  if it had occurred while she was at Yale, for instance, in her study group  she probably wouldnt have known how to deal with those feelings. The email wasnt a big enough affront to justify a response. But all the same, it really bothered her. It was something she felt she needed to address.And thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important. She had graphs and charts telling her that she shouldnt just let it go. And so she typed a quick response: Nothing like a good Ouch! to destroy psych safety in the morning. Her teammate replied: Just testing your resilience.That could have been the wrong thing to say to someone else, but he knew it was exactly what I needed to hear, Rozovsky said. With one 30-second interaction, we defused the tension. She wanted to be listened to. She wanted her teammate to be sensitive to what she was feeling. And I had research telling me that it was O.K. to follow my gut, she said. So thats what I did. The data helped me feel safe enough to do what I thought was right."}

{"text": "MANY parents remember a moment when their toddler astounded them. Maybe he outpaced his playgroup at mastering a song. Maybe she knew an esoteric fact about outer space. They might quietly wonder: Is my child a prodigy?Probably not. A prodigy is defined as a preadolescent child who performs at an adult professional level in a demanding field. True prodigies are incredibly rare. For every Joey Alexander lighting up the Grammys, there are thousands of talented but not prodigious child musicians.Weve known about child prodigies for a long time. In the 1700s, a young Mozart was composing symphonies and dazzling audiences. Academic investigations of prodigies go back at least 90 years.But we still dont know what makes for a true prodigy. Theres no prodigy blood test or genetics screen. Nor do we know how they do it. How does an 8-year-old ace college courses? How can an 18-month-old recite the alphabet backward? This might not seem like a big deal. Whether a child is officially a prodigy has little impact on her life. Parents dont typically seek treatment for a child because she is achieving too much.But what if understanding prodigies would help us understand a seemingly unrelated condition, like autism?No link has yet been proved between autism and prodigy. Prodigies arent typically autistic (unlike savants, in whom extraordinary abilities and autism often coincide), and they dont have the social or communication challenges that characterize autism. But some aspects of prodigy and autism do overlap.Prodigies, like many autistic people, have a nearly insatiable passion for their area of interest. Lauren Voiers, an art prodigy from the Cleveland area, painted well into the night as a teenager; sometimes she didnt sleep at all before school began. That sounds a lot like the highly restricted, fixated interests that are part of autisms diagnostic criteria.Prodigies also have exceptional working memories. In a 2012 study led by one of us, Dr. Ruthsatz, all eight of the prodigies examined scored in the 99th percentile in this area. As the child physicist Jacob Barnett once put it during an interview on 60 Minutes, Every number or math problem I ever hear, I have permanently remembered. Extreme memory has long been linked to autism as well. Dr. Leo Kanner, one of the scientists credited with identifying autism in the 1940s, noted that the autistic children he saw could recite an inordinate number of nursery rhymes, prayers, lists of animals, the roster of presidents, the alphabet forward and backward. A study on talent and autism published in 2015 in The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders found that over half of the more than 200 autistic subjects had unusually good memories.Finally, both prodigies and autistic people have excellent eyes for detail. Simon Baron-Cohen, an autism researcher, and his colleagues have described an excellent eye for detail as a universal feature of the autistic brain. Its one of the categories on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, a self-administered test Dr. Baron-Cohen helped develop that measures autistic traits. The prodigies in Dr. Ruthsatzs 2012 study got high marks in this trait on the test. One of the subjects, Jonathan Russell, a 20-year-old music prodigy who lives in New York, described how startled he gets when the chimes on the subway are slightly off key.Beyond the cognitive similarities, many child prodigies have autistic relatives. In the 2012 study, half of the prodigies had an autistic relative at least as close as a niece or grandparent. Three had received a diagnosis of autism themselves when young, which they seemed to have since grown out of.There might even be evidence of a genetic link between the conditions. In a 2015 study published in Human Heredity, Dr. Ruthsatz and her colleagues examined the DNA of prodigies and their families. They found that the prodigies and their autistic relatives both seemed to have a genetic mutation or mutations on the short arm of Chromosome 1 that were not shared by their neurotypical relatives. Despite a small sample size (the finding rested on five extended prodigy families), the data was statistically significant.Perhaps prodigies have a very specific and unusual form of autism: They have many of the strengths associated with the condition, but few of the difficulties. This makes prodigies potentially important not just for talent research but also for autism research.Autism is, of course, notoriously heterogeneous, and an autism diagnosis doesnt necessarily signify any single underlying biological anomaly. Even autistic siblings often have different genetic risk factors for autism. Some researchers have thus taken to referring to autism not in the singular, but in the plural, as the autisms.We dont want to give false hope. The potential connection between autism and prodigy does not mean that people with autism are actually all geniuses. Rather, the prodigies may be people who were at risk of having this condition, yet dont.Scientists have revolutionized several areas of medicine by identifying resilience genes  mutations that protect against specific diseases. Researchers studying H.I.V., heart disease and Type 2 diabetes have turned conventional methodology on its head: Instead of focusing solely on those who have a particular disease, they have investigated high-risk individuals who remained healthy.In theory, a similar approach could work in the study of prodigy and autism. Prodigies could act as the high risk but unaffected group that could advance our understanding of autism. It does not mean we could develop a treatment or cure, but it could offer major insights.Scientists are making some progress in untangling the underlying biology of brain disorders. The National Institute of Mental Health, for example, has started the Research Domain Criteria initiative, an effort that ignores the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders categories. It instead focuses on integrating data from genetics, cognitive science, behavioral studies and other sources to build a new research framework for brain disorders. As Sarah Morris, the acting director of the project, said, Ultimately the goal is that with better diagnosis you can get better treatment.Pinning down whether the child rattling off outer space trivia is a little advanced for her age or an actual prodigy may be about more than bragging rights. It could help us tackle part of the mystery of autism."}
{"text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.   The National Park Service is looking at using sharpshooters, capture and other methods to reduce the number of bison that are roaming the far northern reaches of the Grand Canyon and damaging resources, officials said.The massive animals can weigh up to 2,000 pounds, and park officials say they are destroying water sources, vegetation, soil and archaeological sites. Hunting is prohibited within park boundaries, but the agency has the authority to kill animals that harm resources, using park staff or volunteer hunters.The Park Service announced in 2014 that it would work on a long-term plan to manage bison and do a more in-depth and lengthy environmental review. But Grand Canyon officials say they have changed course because immediate action is needed to control the growing bison population.Park officials are asking the public for comment. Reduction of the animals could start this winter if everything goes as planned. Between 80 and 200 bison are sustainable, not the 400 to 600 now living on about 310 square miles, officials said.Were considering a suite of tools, Sue Consolo-Murphy, the acting chief of science and resource management, said Friday. Until we get into this, we dont know whats going to work.Identical bills in the House and Senate would let state-licensed hunters kill the bison and harvest the meat. Senator John McCain and Representative Paul Gosar, both Republicans of Arizona, encouraged the culling of the bison as a cost-saving measure and criticized the Park Service for what they see as delayed action.We cant afford to allow more devastation to be caused to the park while the Park Service twiddles their thumbs trying to come up with an expensive plan, Mr. Gosar said in a statement. We have a plan, and it puts Arizona hunters to work doing what they love, accomplishing this important task for free.Ms. Consolo-Murphy said that using volunteers was not out of the question, and that the park was looking at models in other places for shrinking wildlife populations. Anything passed by Congress would have to be integrated into the parks plan.Bison were introduced to the area in the early 1900s as part of a ranching operation to breed them with cattle, creating hybrids known as beefalo or cattalo. The animals no longer look like cattle but have a small percentage, if any, cattle in their genes.Opportunities for hunters to kill them on nearby Federal Forest Service land have diminished because the bison spend more time in the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park."}

A win and his 500th career point made Giroux, the Philadelphia Flyers captain, feel even better.Giroux scored one of Philadelphias three first-period goals, and Mark Streit had three assists to lead the Flyers to a 4-2 victory at home over the Arizona Coyotes on Saturday.Its a good honor to be able to get that many points, Giroux said. Its obviously fun, but the win feels a lot better.Scott Laughton, Sam Gagner and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare also scored for the Flyers, who have won both games so far of a six-game homestand that will most likely determine their playoff fate. Philadelphia began the day behind three teams and 3 points back from a playoff spot.BLUE JACKETS 4, PANTHERS 3 Brandon Dubinsky scored the only shootout goal in the third round, and Scott Hartnell had a goal and assist as Columbus beat visiting Florida, which leads the Atlantic Division.Seth Jones and Brandon Saad also scored for Columbus, which has won nine of its last 14 games. Joonas Korpisalo made 28 saves in regulation and overtime to pick up an 11th win in his last 16 starts.During the game, Florida acquired forward Jiri Hudler from the Calgary Flames for a second-round draft pick this year and a fourth-round pick in 2018, forward Teddy Purcell from the Edmonton Oilers for a 2016 third-round pick, and Jakub Kindl from the Detroit Red Wings for a sixth-round pick in 2017.RED WINGS 5, AVALANCHE 3 Brad Richards scored the winning goal with a minute remaining, and Detroit beat Colorado at Coors Field in the N.H.L.s warmest regular-season outdoor game on record  an unseasonably balmy 65 degrees at puck drop.Richards tipped the game-winning shot over the shoulder of Semyon Varlamov. Tomas Tatar, Gustav Nyquist and Justin Abdelkader also scored for the Red Wings. Darren Helm added an empty-net goal with 20 seconds left to seal the win.PREDATORS 5, BLUES 0 Filip Forsberg recorded his second hat trick in four days, and Pekka Rinne posted a 26-save shutout in Nashvilles win at home.Forsberg scored three goals in 14 minutes to start the second period, leading the Predators to their fourth straight win.PENGUINS 4, JETS 1 Carl Hagelin scored twice, and Pittsburgh welcomed forward Evgeni Malkin back from injury with a victory at home against Winnipeg.Hagelin scored his sixth and seventh goals of the season for Pittsburgh, and Scott Wilson added a third-period goal.CANADIENS 4, MAPLE LEAFS 1 Max Pacioretty scored twice as Montreal beat visiting Toronto for its 10th straight victory in the rivalry.Alex Galchenyuk and Devante Smith-Pelly also scored for Montreal, and Mike Condon had 31 saves.CAPITALS DROP LAICH Washington, which has the leagues best record, placed the struggling forward Brooks Laich on waivers.The organizations longest-tenured player, Laich has just one goal and six assists this season. He is in the midst of a 47-game scoring drought.SHARKS GET A BACKUP GOALIE San Jose filled its last glaring hole before Mondays trade deadline by acquiring goalie James Reimer from the Toronto Maple Leafs to serve as the backup to Martin Jones.San Jose also got forward Jeremy Morin from Toronto for goalie Alex Stalock, forward Ben Smith and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2018 draft."}

Now in his late 40s, he has worked with some of the great traditional flamenco singers of the last several decades  Camarn de la Isla, Enrique Morente, Diego el Cigala and Carmen Linares  but has also been part of the genres modernizing wave: He encompasses the tradition while trying other languages and techniques. (His last album, Tierra, combined flamenco with Celtic music.) Hes played in New York before, but his appearance this week, at Carnegie Halls Stern Auditorium, is part of his first major United States tour.

{"text": "After winning South Carolinas Democratic primary eight years ago, Senator Barack Obama declared that after four great contests, we have the most votes, the most delegates, and have the broadest coalition for change. Tonight it is his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, who can now make the same claim.She has won South Carolina in a rout, 73.5 percent to 26 percent, exceeding Mr. Obamas own 29-point victory in 2008. She did it the same way that Mr. Obama did: with overwhelming support from black voters, who favored Mrs. Clinton over Bernie Sanders by a stunning margin of 87 to 13, according to updated exit polls  a tally that would be larger than Mr. Obamas victory among black voters eight years earlier. Black voters represented 62 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls, even higher than in 2008.The result positions Mrs. Clinton for a sweep of the South in a few days on Super Tuesday and puts the burden on Mr. Sanders to post decisive victories elsewhere. If he does not  and the polls, at least so far, are not encouraging  Mrs. Clinton seems likely to amass a significant and possibly irreversible lead.For Mrs. Clinton, the path to the presidential nomination is straightforward: fight Mr. Sanders to a draw among the nonblack voters who dominate the partys contests in many Northern and Western states, and win by huge margins among black voters, who represent about a quarter of Democratic voters nationally. They represent the majority of Democrats in the South, which will play a crucial role on Super Tuesday.The results in South Carolina  as well as in Nevada, where Mrs. Clinton also won black voters by a wide margin  suggest that she can count on big wins in six Super Tuesday states where black voters represent an above-average share of Democratic voters: Alabama, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Georgia. The polls say the same thing.As a result, the Sanders campaign has effectively conceded the South on Super Tuesday. The campaign is not airing advertisements there, according to NBC News data. Its instead concentrating resources in five states with far fewer black voters and far fewer delegates: Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont. It is a strategy that aims to maximize Mr. Sanderss chance of winning states, but it doesnt necessarily prevent Mrs. Clinton from running up huge delegate leads from the South.The likelihood of a Clinton landslide in the delegate-rich South means that Mr. Sanders cant compensate with a few narrow, feel-good wins outside the South. The thing to watch on Tuesday night is whether Mr. Sanders can win by big  even double-digit  margins in states like Minnesota or Massachusetts. The margins matter, because delegates are awarded proportionally in the Democratic nomination contest.A simple rule of thumb: Mr. Sanders needs to win nonblack voters by one-third as much as Mrs. Clinton wins black voters. With Mrs. Clinton ahead among black voters by 50 or 60 points, based on results in Nevada and South Carolina, Mr. Sanders needs to win nonblack voters  and nonblack states  by something like 20 points.Even this might not be enough in a place like Minnesota or Massachusetts, depending on whether one assumes that Mr. Sanders has an advantage in caucus states like Minnesota or a state bordering Vermont like Massachusetts. If Mrs. Clinton has an advantage among Hispanic voters, in addition to black voters, then the burden on Mr. Sanders would grow even more to dominate with white voters in states like Massachusetts or Minnesota.The polling, at least for now, says Mr. Sanders is not positioned to win by these sorts of margins. Hes in a tight race in Massachusetts. Hes in a tight race in Oklahoma, a state with a below-average black population and a large number of working-class Democrats. There is not much polling in Colorado or Minnesota, but there isnt much evidence of a blowout there or in neighboring Wisconsin.Perhaps Mr. Sanderss best chance of earning a blowout win would be to take advantage of the caucus format, as Mr. Obama did in 2008. Mr. Obama won states like Minnesota and Colorado by two-to-one margins with strength among Democratic activists and a superior organization. This was a big part of how Mr. Obama held a clear advantage in pledged delegates despite being even in the popular vote  and Mr. Sanders would certainly benefit from a similar phenomenon.This could happen. It depends, to some extent, on why Mrs. Clinton struggled in caucuses last time. Was it because she was poorly organized? Was it because her working-class supporters were less likely to vote? Was it because caucuses are just vastly more liberal? Was it because caucuses attract only the most well-informed and committed voters  the sort who make campaign contributions? The first two explanations might bode well for her this time, since she fares better among affluent voters and shes better organized than last time. The latter two might augur better for Mr. Sanders, who has received far more small donations than Mrs. Clinton.In an interview last week, Ben Tulchin, a pollster with the Sanders campaign, did not seem optimistic about his candidates chances in closed caucuses. He said that there was opportunity to organize, but that such caucuses were difficult for independents, who would have to change their party registration to participate, and young voters  two sources of strength for Mr. Sanders. Theyre not tailor-made for us, he said. Its still structurally challenging for us to do well. He was more optimistic about open caucuses, in states like Nebraska and Alaska. Whether Mr. Tulchins thoughts reflect the campaigns views or represent an effort to lower expectations is hard to say.Whats clear is that modest Sanders wins in Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma would not indicate that he had much of a chance to overtake Mrs. Clintons delegate lead."}
{"text": "IMAGINE, for a moment, the presidential candidacy of a rich, brash real estate magnate and reality TV star named Donna Trump.Quizzically coifed and stubbornly sun-kissed, shes on her third marriage. Theres clear evidence that infidelity factored into the demise of the first, and among her children is one conceived when The Donna wasnt married to the other parent.Her sexual appetites have been prodigious, at least according to her frequent claims and vulgar cant. And she has a tendency  disturbing on its own, even more so in someone who aspires to civic leadership  to talk about men as sirloins and rump roasts of disparate succulence. She denigrates those who displease her on cosmetic grounds:So-and-so used to be a 9 but, with that male-pattern baldness and desperate comb-over, is down to a 6. So-and-so thinks hes covering up that paunch with baggy suits, but we all know better.How well do you think The Donna would do in the polls? How far into the race would she survive?The 2016 quest for the White House has included ample exegeses on gender and plenty of talk about double standards, but most if not all of those have pertained to Hillary Clinton. Is a raised, emphatic voice heard as something more grating when it emanates from a woman? Is toughness perceived as something more pernicious when the hide and stride are female?But for an even more obvious, indisputable example of unequal treatment, look to Trump. A woman with his personal life, public comportment and potty mouth wouldnt last a nanosecond in a political campaign  or, for that matter, in a boardroom. Her name on a line of scarves wouldnt be the selling point that his on a line of ties is.The moral judgments  in particular the sexual ones  that we make about men and women are utterly and unjustly dissimilar. This primary season, and the back stories swirling around it, have illustrated that anew.Bill Clintons sexual behavior before and during his presidency surged back into the conversation, and I was struck again by the fact that a woman dogged by as many accusations of philandering as he was would never have won the White House.And a woman who behaved as he did in the White House wouldnt now be seen as someone who could lend a positive jolt to her spouses presidential campaign with frequent appearances on the trail. Shed be tucked away in an attic somewhere, damaged goods forevermore.Im not arguing for greater chastity in men. Im arguing for a fairer and more forgiving attitude toward women.Im noting, as I have before, what the journalist Peggy Orenstein explores so forthrightly and explains so well in her timely new book, Girls & Sex, to be published next month.A sexually active girl is a slut, while a similar boy is a player,  Orenstein writes, acknowledging this as a timeless dichotomy. Now, though, girls who abstain from sex, once thought of as the good girls, are shamed as well, labeled virgins (which is not a good thing) or prudes. A young woman is supposed to be some sexual Goldilocks, finding a just right between frisky and frigid. A young man simply has fun.The Trump campaigns success doesnt say anything good about our progress toward gender equality, not merely because he gets away with things that a woman never would but because he thrives in spite of overtly sexist language and remarks that routinely objectify women.These have been duly noted in many compendiums, including an especially clever one by Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott in BuzzFeed last week. They listened to hours of audio from Trumps appearances on Howard Sterns radio show over the years, and they unearthed such gems as his boast  just months after Princess Dianas death  that he probably could have slept with her; his ratings of the attractiveness of the cast of Desperate Housewives on a scale of 1 to 10; his assertion that he probably couldnt work up an erection for Madonna; and his declaration, after he purchased the Miss USA pageant, that he wanted the bathing suits to be smaller and the heels to be higher.More somber examinations of Trump and sexism, however, have been crowded out by reflections on his diatribes against, say, Mexicans and Muslims. Commentators have wrung their hands to rawness over how a Trump presidency might inflame tensions on racial and religious fronts and what an intolerant portrait of America it would project to the world.BUT what about the way a Trump presidency would make the women of this country feel? Or how Trumps sexual braggadocio would diminish the dignity of the office and the country?Female voters have not flocked to him in the same percentages as male voters, according to exit polls from the caucuses and primaries thus far. And national surveys suggest that the Republican Party could be looking at an especially ruinous gender gap if Trump is its nominee.In a hypothetical matchup of Clinton versus Trump, shed get 54 percent of women to his 35 percent, with the rest going elsewhere or sitting on the fence, according to a Fox News poll from less than two weeks ago. That 19-point advantage for the Democrat would be greater than the one that Barack Obama got in his 2012 race against Mitt Romney (11 points) or his 2008 contest against John McCain (13 points).And we can presume that the gap isnt solely about Clintons appeal. After all, she lost the womens vote to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire by 11 points.To be fair to Trump, there are moments when he has exhibited something more than just a drooling interest in the opposite sex. At last weeks Republican debate, he defended Planned Parenthood (somewhat) against his rivals blanket vilification of it by noting that millions and millions of women  cervical cancer, breast cancer  are helped by Planned Parenthood. (He nonetheless said hed cut off any federal funds to it.)But such bright spots of sensitivity are eclipsed by the creepy stuff, like his repeated references to his daughter Ivanka as someone who, in a different situation, he might well date.What a beauty, that one, he told Paul Solotaroff, who profiled him for Rolling Stone, last year. If I werent happily married and, ya know, her father .Now put those words in The Donnas mouth instead. What a hunk, that one, she says of one of her sons. If I werent happily married and, ya know, his mother. . . Wed never hear the end of it. And yet we havent seen the end of Trump."}
{"text": "My mother recently ended a long-term relationship. She and her ex-boyfriend loved skiing together, and she really misses it. Last week, my boyfriends firm invited us to a ski retreat in Park City, Utah. It is a work event with significant others only. It is also the first time my boyfriend qualified to attend. (Its a prestigious invitation; all expenses are paid by the company.) My mother asked if she could come along. We explained the context to her, but she keeps pushing to join us. What should we do?ASHLEYProps to your mom for showing the same determined selfishness as Robert Redfords foxy young ski champ in the movie Downhill Racer. (Maybe stream it with her?) Companies go to extreme lengths at these retreats to reward high achievers and build camaraderie among them and their significant others. Children (and in-laws) are conspicuously absent. You should not take Big Mama, though I sympathize with her breakup (and love of skiing). It would be weird. And even if she did tag along, she would never see you. You are going to be a busy (networking) bee.Sometimes, people (even mothers) cant hear no until we actually say it. Explaining the context isnt enough. Say: Im sorry, Mom, you cant come. Its work. But if you can afford it, tack on a few days to the beginning or end of your trip and invite her to swoosh down a few double black diamonds then.I am a member of a racial minority. Often, a person I do not know will take pains to bring a matter to my attention (a news article, movie or lecture) that features the subject of my race. I dont pretend that people are color blind. But I am put off when a person I have just met tells me that I should read a book on my groups experience with the American justice system. How should I respond?VALERIE, NORTH CAROLINAI am going to ask something unfair of you, Valerie. And I will understand if you refuse. I am not a member of a visible minority. (As a gay person, strangers pretty much stopped calling me out on it after middle school.) So I cant fully grasp your discomfort at these interactions, but I get how reductive it is for strangers to instantly raise people of color topics on meeting you.Still, if this dynamic creates opportunities for much-needed discussion about the racism that is baked into so many of our cultures institutions, think again about taking them up. (That is the unfair part.) If you prefer not to, which is your absolute right, just say, Why, exactly, do you suppose that book will interest me?The other folks will probably be embarrassed by their remarks and may stop making this error in the future  which also ensures that a subject that should be discussed more will be discussed less. I get that I am asking you to shoulder an unjust burden. I only hope, occasionally, you may be willing to. (And if the book is Just Mercy, everyone should read it.)I work at a media company, 90 percent of whom are men between 30 and 45. A few sprinkle every conversation with a particular swear word. At an industry breakfast meeting, one used that expletive when he said,Theyve got [expletive]food! I told him not to use that word in public or in front of customers or prospects. He replied,I am a grown-up. (I did not say, Then act like one.) How should I deal with these outbursts, many of which are witnessed by the company owner?ANONYMOUSYou are not their supervisor, correct? There is a big distinction between asking people not to curse because it offends us and directing them not to (or how to do their jobs properly). We are in no position to issue edicts to co-workers, particularly if the big boss has no issue with them. But it will be much harder for these guys to continue their blue streaks if you approach them quietly and say: Your swearing bothers me. Can you try to knock it off?I am a college student. Two of my closest friends and I applied for a competitive campus club. They got in, and I did not. One of them is sensitive about not bringing it up; the other talks about the club all the time. Shes not doing it to rub it in my face, but hearing about it makes me feel sad. How can I ask her not to?ANONYMOUSWe win many victories in our lives and suffer many defeats. And we must learn how to be gracious about both. Better for you to find another club or activity that you can be enthusiastic about than try to squelch your pals (not-cruel) excitement. This club is part of her life now, and if you want to stay close with her, you are going to have to hear about it, though probably less over time. If its any consolation, you will learn much more from this rejection than she will from her easy win."}

{"text": "In a campaign season without peer in insult tragicomedy, consider Saturdays candidate-on-candidate exchanges:Donald J. Trump has the nations worst spray tan and requires a Hair Force One. Marco Rubio is too dim to have attended Mr. Trumps Ivy League alma mater.Mr. Trump calls to mind that lunatic in North Korea with nuclear ambitions. Mr. Rubio relies on his outsize ears to protect against flop sweat.And then there was this broadside  perhaps the closest that one Oval Office aspirant has come in modern times to accusing another of being ugly as sin.Donald Trump likes to sue people, Mr. Rubio told an audience in Kennesaw, Ga., as he appraised his rivals complexion. He should sue whoever did that to his face.With three days to go before the so-called Super Tuesday voting contests  a potentially decisive day that could accelerate Mr. Trumps march to the Republican Partys presidential nomination, or stall it  the descent into schoolyard jabbing continued apace on Saturday, with Mr. Rubio increasingly sounding like Mr. Trump, the blustery candidate he is chasing in the polls.Since the Republican debate on Thursday in Houston, Mr. Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, has taken a hatchet to the core of the Trump mystique, casting him as a con man with a hucksters business record  a figure who would be selling watches on the streets of Manhattan if not for his fathers wealth.On Saturday night, Mr. Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas released several years of tax returns, drawing a comparison with Mr. Trump, who has declined to make his taxes public while he says he is being audited by the I.R.S.Here are Marcos tax returns, Mr. Rubios website said. Where are Trumps?Mr. Rubios filings showed that he and his wife, Jeanette, earned an average of $458,000 a year from 2010 to 2014, a time when Mr. Rubios Senate salary, $174,000 last year, was lifted by windfalls from book deals. Mr. Rubio has also earned money from teaching at Florida International University, and Mrs. Rubio from a part-time job advising Norman Braman, a billionaire supporter of Mr. Rubio, on his charitable endeavors.Mr. Cruzs returns showed that he and his wife, Heidi, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Houston, reported adjusted gross income averaging about $1.25 million a year from 2011 to 2014, including his Senate salary, his wifes income and earnings from a book deal.The Rubios paid an effective tax rate averaging about 23 percent; the Cruzes rate hovered around 30 percent.Both men included only the first two pages of the 1040 forms, and did not include more granular details about income and charitable giving. Earlier releases by other candidates, like those by Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton last year, provided such information in voluminous disclosures.On Saturday, Mr. Cruz suggested a reason that Mr. Trump had not released his tax returns. Maybe Donalds not as rich as he says he is, Mr. Cruz taunted, before noting Mr. Trumps inheritance from his daddy.Doing his best to break through the Rubio-Trump din, Mr. Cruz also let fly a rare curse.Say, This is my future, this is my kids, this is my grandkids  this is my country, damn it! he said in Perry, Ga., urging voters to rally their friends and families.Mr. Trump still enjoyed a typical day on Saturday, by his standards. He received the public support of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right former leader of the National Front party in France, and of Jan Brewer, a former Republican governor of Arizona.At a rally in Bentonville, Ark., Mr. Trump regaled the crowd with a lengthy accounting of his legal entanglements with the New York State attorney general, describing himself as so non-litigious, its amazing.At issue is Trump University, a series of seminars where those who signed up were told that they would be able to learn Mr. Trumps real estate insights. The effort remains enmeshed in lawsuits accusing Mr. Trump of misrepresentation, a fact Mr. Rubio has gleefully highlighted.I will address little Rubio, Mr. Trump said at one point, using a new favorite put-down for his rival. The guy has a fresh mouth.Mr. Trump observed that the Trump University suit was subject to a very hostile judge.Hes Hispanic, which is fine, Mr. Trump said. We havent asked for a recusal, which we may do.At another moment, Mr. Trump also argued that neither Mr. Rubio nor Mr. Cruz could have found the success he did, reminding the crowd that he attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Hoping to knock the intelligence of Mr. Rubio, who attended the University of Florida and the University of Miami law school, Mr. Trump seemed to approach a minefield of race and class.The Rubios of the world could not get into that school, Mr. Trump said.

Shaped like the letter E, the eight-story warehouse spanned a square city block and was a distribution center for the Chicago-based companys catalog business and its Ben Franklin five-and-dime stores and Federated stores.Now, like so many relics of the past, the warehouse at 350 Warren Street is being reimagined as 366 residential lofts, and rechristened for a new generation as Modera Lofts, with monthly rents starting at about $2,070 for a 446-square-foot studio. Reminders of its grittier past hang from the walls: In one apartments den, steel pulleys from the original elevators poke through the exposed brick. Original wood beams crisscross the ceilings of the 500,000-square-foot building with brick walls measuring two feet thick.You dont see something like that on this scale  its quite extraordinary, said John Gomez, a founder of the Jersey City Landmarks Conservancy and an architectural historian who is writing a book about Gothic architecture. The Butler building is a time capsule for the Arts and Crafts style of building on an industrial scale.For some residents of the Powerhouse Arts District, which lies between Paulus Hook and Newport, the warehouses restoration stands as a victory for a neighborhood that has seen many defeats. Designed by the architect Jarvis Hunt, whose uncle Richard Morris Hunt designed the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty, the Butler Brothers building was among the last post-and-beam industrial buildings of the early 20th century.The neighborhood, roughly 11 blocks bounded by Marin Boulevard and Second, Washington and Steuben Streets, was designated a special district by the city in 2004. Yet some of the buildings that give the area a distinct character have faced the wrecking ball over the past decade. Among them was 111 First Street, a former tobacco factory that was an artists residence and a neighborhood hub. It was demolished in 2007 to make way for a Rem Koolhaas-designed residential tower that has not yet been built. A neighboring warehouse, 110 First Street, was demolished in 2004, replaced by a 36-story rental tower, the One, that opened last year.The Butler Brothers building also faced an uncertain future when a previous owner attempted to demolish it to build a high-rise. After the city rebuffed those demands, Mill Creek Residential, a Dallas-based developer, bought the property with Rockwood Capital in April 2014 for $38 million. At a 2013 meeting with the community, residents were skeptical about the new owners intentions.We felt embattled by this constant loss of the character of the neighborhood, and that led the neighborhood to be very wary, said Marc Neal Simon, a local resident and a member of the Powerhouse Arts District Neighborhood Association who attended that early meeting. Instead, we were wonderfully surprised to see the care that Mill Creek gave to this project.For residents, the Butler buildings survival is evidence that renovation can be a lucrative alternative to demolition. But restoring a deteriorating century-old factory does not come cheap. In this case, it cost $150 million. The roof was replaced, the facade was repointed, and masons enlarged the brick openings for all 1,200 windows. For three months, workers sandblasted the brick walls and wooden beams, sanding the columns by hand. When we first walked into this, it was intimidating, said Richard Murphy, the managing director of Mill Creek's northeast division, noting that the building had not been loved in decades.The loft-style apartments retain original elements, including a bedroom in one apartment with four brick walls. Rooms are oddly shaped, and some have no windows  a partition wall brings light and air. While most rooms have the original exposed wood slat ceilings, a few barrel-style ceilings are made of terra cotta.Leasing began in December, with the first residents expected to move in this April. One-bedrooms range from $2,650 to around $3,675 a month; two-bedrooms from about $3,550 to $4,650; and three-bedrooms from $5,195 to $5,700.The building will have a gym, a lounge, a rooftop deck and office space for tenants who work from home. It will also house 14 artists studios, with rents starting at around $1,000 a month for a 280-square-foot space. In May, a 3,500-square-foot gallery, the Novado Gallery, will open on the ground floor. We watched the district get chewed away slowly, Mr. Gomez said, but now its getting restored."}

My Captain!Dead Poets Society, the hit 1989 film about a group of prep school boys who discover a love for poetry inspired by their new English teacher, is being adapted into a play by Tom Schulman, the screenwriter who won an Oscar for his work on the film. The theatrical version will have its world premiere in October at Classic Stage Company, an Off Broadway nonprofit theater.The film starred Robin Williams as the teacher, and featured Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles among the students. Casting for the Classic Stage production has not been announced.The play will be directed by John Doyle, a highly regarded Scottish minimalist who won a Tony in 2006 for his direction of Sweeney Todd and whose direction of the current Broadway revival of The Color Purple opened to critical acclaim. Mr. Doyle has been appointed the new artistic director of Classic Stage, and will assume his duties there in July; Dead Poets Society will be his first production in his new role.Mr. Doyles first season as artistic director of Classic Stage will also include a revival of Pacific Overtures, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by John Weidman. Mr. Doyle will direct; he has previously directed several other Sondheim shows, including not only Sweeney Todd but also Company on Broadway and Passion at Classic Stage. His Pacific Overtures will begin performances in April 2017.The Classic Stage season will also include a production of The Liar, a farce adapted by David Ives (Venus in Fur) from a 17th-century French comedy by Pierre Corneille. The Liar, scheduled to begin performances in January, will be directed by Michael Kahn, who is the artistic director of the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington."}

They are expected to spend roughly $20 million on the effort.The first element of this campaign will be a $500,000 digital ad buy, in partnership with the American Federation of Teachers, which will run in early states with a focus on Texas, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.Right now, young women are some of the most dedicated and active progressives this country has ever seen, Denise Feriozzi, the deputy executive director of Emilys list, said in a statement. And we have the candidate to match this moment.Titled Give Em Hill, the campaign will cite Mrs. Clintons record and her fight for equal pay for women. The content revolves around a website and two 15-second pre-roll ads that will run on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and elsewhere online, with a casual style tailored for the millennial audience.When you find out that bro who has your same job gets paid more than you, a woman says in the ad, you give em Hill, before a Vote for Hillary on March 1 title card closes the ad.The effort comes as Mrs. Clinton has struggled to connect with younger voters, who have flocked to Senator Bernie Sanderss campaign. In New Hampshire, 79 percent of women under 30 voted for Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton, according to exit poll data."}

{"text": "Turns out the Oscar outfits were also white, #SoWhite...#SewWhite. Not merely the fabrics  though the nominee Rooney Mara looked like a medieval-castle bride in a Givenchy gown of cream translucent tapestry with a window over her midriff  but the fashion houses.At an event being excoriated if not boycotted outright for its neglect of minorities, the red-carpet parade, in recent years derided for objectifying women, might have been claimed this year by nimble stylists as an opportunity to champion designers of color and independence.But instead, viewers were treated mostly to a numbing procession of corporate labels including Chanel (Julianne Moore, in a deeply V-necked black gown with glitter banding and triangular straps), Dior (Charlize Theron, in a deeply V-necked red gown with low back and spaghetti straps) and Louis Vuitton (Alicia Vikander, the winner for best supporting actress, who in her strapless lemon-yellow frock covered hither and thither with silver sprinkles resembled a very slender cupcake).Thus was represented France. Then there was Italy. Brie Larson wore Gucci, the label revivified by Alessandro Michele: a billowy, bold, blue ruffled frock whose lightness was bisected and somewhat weighed down by a large jeweled belt. Cate Blanchett returned to one of her regular sponsors, Armani, who made over red-carpet dressing in the 1990s with beige and subtle sequins but here came up with something suitable for a fairy princess leaping frantically between lily pads to get to her frog: sea foam and flecked with fluttery flowers.And then came the New World. Kate Winslet was in basic black Ralph Lauren, also strapless, and so shiny that it seemed she might have just returned from a dip off the deck of the Titanic, cleverly accessorized with her former co-star in the movie about that doomed ship, Leonardo DiCaprio. Saoirse Ronan specified to her interrogator that she had her simple Calvin Klein slipdress rendered in lucky shamrock green, to reflect her Irish heritage. Everyone comes from somewhere else, she said pointedly. We all came off the boat.But in this United Nations convention of clothes were some notable absences. Where, for example, was the work of Jason Wu, whose inauguration dress Michelle Obama has led to a career lined bounteously in chiffon, but not the expected results on Oscar nights? Or the Nigerian Duro Olowu, whose joyfully juxtaposed prints were sampled by Ms. Ronan in an earlier awards appearance? Or Stephen Burrows, who in 1978 produced a gold-mesh slipdress for Farrah Fawcett that is still being knocked off today, in both silhouette and shade?Actually gold, often worn for its associations with winning, mostly stayed in the background this evening, as did silver  though the veteran actress Charlotte Rampling, besieged after comments seized upon by some as racist, appeared in what amounted to armor: a modest chain-mail caftan by Armani Priv.In the place of these metallics was purple, appropriately enough for a ceremony that anoints Hollywood royalty. It was modeled by Reese Witherspoon in an Oscar de la Renta ball gown, strapless again, with a boned bodice that ended in asymmetrical poufs. Tina Fey had on an almost identical dress (from Atelier Versace), but the top was sleeker. The model and entrepreneur Heidi Klum, meanwhile, brought a rare and rather refreshing dose of goofy with purples little sister lavender, a chiffon confection fastened by rosettes by Marchesa, whose single arm recalled a decades-old experiment by Kim Basinger.The only other truly outr effort was by the costume designer of Carol, Sandy Powell, whose homage to David Bowie  a teal brocade pantsuit worn with shock of orange hair  was so transformative that onlookers had her confused with Tilda Swinton for several minutes.Jennifer Lawrence displayed her summit-of-the-A-list status by showing up too late to name-drop the designer of her filigree-black lace dress, its skirt topped with jagged points and its upper half utterly lingerie-like. (It was by Dior, a brand she represents.) Her counterpart in the youthful contest for maximum sex appeal was Olivia Wilde, the producer of a documentary about the Ebola virus: gorgeously incongruous in white Valentino couture, whose apronlike front would surely draw an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.

{"text": "WELLESLEY, Mass.   Here among the historic brick towers and wooded hills of Hillary Clintons alma mater, Wellesley Students for Hillary has a robust campus organization. But so has Wellesley Students for Bernie.On Thursday night, the pro-Sanders group brought the actress Susan Sarandon to campus and drew nearly 200 people, though many were from outside the college.I salute all the women here who are all going to be in hell with me, Ms. Sarandon said with a smile as she resurrected the admitted blunder proffered this month by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (a Wellesley College graduate and Clinton ally)  that there is a special place in hell for women who do not support other women.Ms. Sarandons audience whooped and applauded.The fervor for Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, among millennials is well known; in the New Hampshire primary, he captured 83 percent of voters between 18 and 29, according to exit polls.That passion is alive and well in Massachusetts, which will hold its Democratic presidential primary on so-called Super Tuesday this week, but there is a big difference here, and it raises a red flag for Mr. Sanders: While he is swamping Mrs. Clinton among millennials, his grip on them is not as tight as it has been in other states. At the same time, Mrs. Clinton is drawing such strong support among older women here that the polls give her a slight edge on Tuesday.Among Massachusetts voters 18 to 29, Mr. Sanders led Mrs. Clinton 67 percent to 25 percent, according to polling released on Friday by the MassINC Polling Group for WBUR, an NPR station in Boston.But for voters 45 and older, those numbers start to turn. And they were almost reversed for women over 50, who favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders 63 percent to 23 percent.Although Boston has one of the youngest populations in the country, the state as a whole is top-heavy with older people. Voters 45 and over outnumber those under 45 by almost two to one. In 2008, Barack Obama won younger voters here but lost the state to Mrs. Clinton by 16 percentage points.Over all in the WBUR poll, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders 47 percent to 43 percent; a Suffolk University poll released on Sunday showed a wider gap, with Mrs. Clinton at almost 50 percent and Mr. Sanders at 42 percent.With Mrs. Clintons blowout over Mr. Sanders in South Carolina on Saturday, Massachusetts has become a must-win state for Mr. Sanders. Both candidates are campaigning here on Monday ahead of Tuesdays voting. Former President Bill Clinton also plans to campaign in the state on Monday night.The group keeping Clinton ahead are older women, where she holds a 41-point lead, said Steve Koczela, the president of MassINC.Young people need to turn out in big numbers for Sanders to overcome Clintons major advantage among women over 50, he said. It could happen, though Democratic turnout this year so far hasnt kept pace with 2008, and lower turnout tends to mean an older electorate.With that in mind, Mr. Sanders has focused intently on the colleges here. While he has been hopscotching around the country in advance of Super Tuesday, when 11 states vote, he made time last week to visit the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, a hub for five colleges in western Massachusetts and one of the few areas of the state that Mr. Obama won in 2008.In October, Mr. Sanders drew a near-record crowd of 24,000 in Boston. (Mr. Obama beat Mrs. Clinton in Boston by two percentage points.)Support for Mr. Sanders is so prevalent among young people that some students who support Mrs. Clinton say they often feel under siege when expressing their views, even among friends.If you come out as a Hillary supporter, you have to be ready to defend yourself, said Nicolas Thilo-McGovern, 19, a freshman at Emerson College in Boston, who was canvassing this month in Cambridge for Mrs. Clinton.People come after you, come after you as a person, as if youre bad, he said. I havent come out for her as loudly as I feel like I should because of that.Mrs. Clinton has by no means ceded the millennials. Her campaign has teams on more than a dozen Massachusetts college campuses. That includes Wellesley, where Hannah Lindow, 22, heads the team and spends most of her time at phone banks, raising money, canvassing and talking with her classmates.This election will be won or lost in dorm rooms and dining halls, she said.While both candidates have strong ground games, analysts say winning Massachusetts is essential for Mr. Sanders, but less so for Mrs. Clinton.If Mr. Sanders loses this state, where Democratic primary voters are among the most liberal in the country, his long-term prospects are likely to dim.If Mrs. Clinton loses here, she is still expected to win most Southern states that vote on Tuesday, which could put her on the glide path to the nomination without Massachusetts.One sign of the importance that the Sanders campaign attaches to Massachusetts is its television spending. Between Feb. 10 and last Monday, he spent $1.2 million in four media markets reaching Massachusetts voters, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising; Mrs. Clinton spent $362,000, about a third as much, though both have spent more since then.David Paleologos, a pollster at Suffolk University, said Mrs. Clinton could dismiss a loss here as a regional win for the Vermont senator. But, he said, there are only a few states in play for Sanders on Super Tuesday, Massachusetts being one of them."}

Finding a way to bring art appreciation to the drudgery of commuting, for example, is behind a collaboration presented in a German subway. There are even degree programs in social practice devoted to creating and presenting communal art.What is your opinion of the public art youve experienced, heard about or read about? Do you see any downside to presenting art in potentially unexpected places? Should there be more public art? Less? Why?In the article Gnome Homes Enchant a Pennsylvania Park, Until Theyre Evicted, Mike McPhate writes:When the gnomes moved into a Pennsylvania state park, the children in town begged their parents to take them there.Hikers had begun spotting the whimsical dwellings along the footpaths of Little Buffalo State Park, northwest of Harrisburg, in early December. As word spread on social media and in a local news broadcast, more and more families came, some traveling two or three hours.But the fun was to be short lived. The smurf-like village was dismantled this week after state officials, citing the surge of visitors, declared it unwelcome, in a move that has generated outrage well beyond the parks small-town setting by the Juniata River.We dont really think its a state park kind of thing, Jason Baker, the parks manager, said. We like to have more visitors. We like having people come here. But the experience were trying to give is a natural, ecological experience.The gnome homes were the creation of Steve Hoke, 65, a former prison counselor and a grandfather of five who lives in nearby Newport. Restless in his retirement, Mr. Hoke said he was inspired by a video he saw about a similar project in Kansas.He got permission from park officials to give it a try at Little Buffalo, where he walks daily, and set about building the wooden homes.The idea was to get kids out of the house, away from the electronics, and go for a walk, Mr. Hoke said.Altogether, he created 38 dwellings. Some sat atop wooden stumps, while others were little more than colorful doors affixed by hinges to holes in trees. They carried tiny signs that read gnome headquarters, enjoy the forest or gnomes are natures work. The creatures themselves showed up later, placed by an anonymous fellow traveler, Mr. Hoke said.Mr. Baker, the park manager, said things got out of hand.It blew up a lot bigger than we ever expected it to be, he said, citing worries about compacted soil and disruptions of wildlife habitat.When he ran the issue up the state parks chain of command, it was decided that the gnome houses were a bad fit.We feel bad that people are disappointed, Mr. Baker said. However, part of our mission is to teach conservation and environmental ethics, and we dont want to teach those kids that there are gnomes out here in the woods.Students: Read the entire article, then answer the questions below: What is your opinion about the turn of events at Little Buffalo State Park regarding the installation and eventual removal of the gnome houses? Do you consider the gnome houses and figures art? Explain. Do you think a state park is an appropriate setting for the displays? Why or why not? Given that Mr. Hoke was given permission before placing his creations in the park, what do you think were park officials original expectations? What are the potential outcomes of more people visiting a place like Little Buffalo State Park? Given public reaction, what do you think will happen next? Why?

{"text": "TAMPA, Fla.   The most riveting matchup Sunday at Steinbrenner Field did not take place on the field, but above it  and then into the stands, onto the backfields and the shrubs that surround the Yankees complex.It involved a stadium operations official in a cherry picker, armed with a basket, a blanket and a stick, trying to capture a raccoon from atop the 40-foot-high screen behind home plate. After several efforts were thwarted by the hissing raccoon, the employee whacked it with the stick, sending the raccoon hurtling down to the stands as witnesses shrieked.As more than a dozen stadium workers converged on the animal, it sprang to life and led them on a chase, sprinting toward the right-field line, then doubling back toward home plate before it headed up to the top row of the stadium.Cornered again, the raccoon jumped down to a plaza below and scampered off toward the back fields before finding shelter  and apparently a reprieve  in the shrubs.It was the Yankees first blown rundown of the year.The raccoon is alive and well, said the Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo, adding that the team needed to clear the raccoon from the field before it let fans in to watch practice out of concern for their safety.It is not the first time the Yankees have been forced to confront wild creatures. In 2007, a squirrel climbed up and down the right-field foul pole during a game against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, an incident that led a Norse scholar to fear that it portended good fortune for the Red Sox and misfortune for the Yankees.Later that year, the Yankees were done in  not just by the Indians, but by the midges that swarmed them in a playoff game in Cleveland. Meanwhile, the Red Sox won the World Series.The raccoons appearance may not be an ominous sign. Last year, on their way to the World Series, the Mets discovered a baby raccoon in their clubhouse at the end of July. That night, the Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in extra innings, and thus Rally Raccoon was born.The Yankees complex is a welcoming place for animal life, with geese and other fowl making themselves at home in several ponds around the premises. Two years ago, a raccoon  presumably a different one  was discovered sitting in one of the stadium seats catching a glimpse of a workout.Sunday mornings chase took place while the Yankees were safely sequestered in their clubhouse for a meeting with Tony Clark, the executive director of the players union. But they quickly caught wind of it on social media.They should have sent me up there, said Brett Gardner, an avid hunter and fisherman from South Carolina, who displayed a good deal of derring-do last spring when he scaled the outfield wall to retrieve Chris Youngs glove.Ivan Nova said he had to chase raccoons out of his familys home in the Dominican Republic as a boy, but they did not bother him. Snakes, though, terrify him  something that his son knows from placing a rubber snake on his bed.But Zillo, the spokesman, said the Yankees had been impressed by what they had seen of the raccoon.Agility, speed, determination, Zillo said. He checked a lot of boxes that our scouts like.TOPICS OF CONCERN  With baseballs collective bargaining agreement expiring after this season, Tony Clark addressed the Yankees for nearly an hour.Among the topics that are likely to be part of the negotiations is the use of qualifying offers, which agents contend has restricted interest in free agents because teams have to forfeit a draft pick as compensation for signing them.Players like Dexter Fowler, Yovani Gallardo and Ian Desmond, who had productive seasons in 2015, found themselves without contracts until last week. Desmond signed with the Texas Rangers on Sunday.Its a concern anytime you have a system in place that for whatever reason suggests that players who can help teams perform well on the field and compete do not have jobs, Clark said.Clark skirted commenting directly on the domestic violence case of Aroldis Chapman, who could face a suspension from Commissioner Rob Manfred, but he did support the new policy, even though it gives broad power to Manfred.The truth is there really werent any guidelines or ramifications that were going to afford either party to function in a fashion that most would determine makes sense, Clark said. As a result, what we negotiated we think does that.SUMMONED TO START Luis Severino, Ivan Nova and Bryan Mitchell will start the Yankees first three exhibition games. The opener is Wednesday against the Detroit Tigers. ... Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Beltran are not likely to play Wednesday, Manager Joe Girardi said. ... Nova was hit in the thigh by a line drive off the bat of Aaron Judge, but deflected the ball with his glove."}

All data is anonymous and aggregated, they say, meaning individual consumers cannot be identified.Still, Mr. Stevens acknowledged that the companys new offering does sound a bit creepy.But, he added, the company was using the same data that mobile advertisers have been using for years, and showing certain ads to a specific group of consumers was not a new idea. Its easy to forget that were just tapping into an existing data ecosystem, he said.In many ways, billboards are still stuck in the old-media world, where companies tried to determine how many people saw billboards by counting the cars that drove by. But in recent years, billboard companies have made more of an effort to step into the digital age. Some billboards, for example, have been equipped with small cameras that collect information about the people walking by. Clear Channel Outdoors move is yet another attempt to modernize billboards and enable the kind of audience measurements that advertisers have come to expect.Privacy advocates, however, have long raised questions about mobile device tracking, particularly as companies have melded this location information with consumers online behavior to form detailed audience profiles. Opponents contend that people often do not realize their location and behavior are being tracked, even if they have agreed at some point to allow companies to monitor them. And while nearly all of these companies claim that the data they collect is anonymous and aggregated  and that consumers can opt out of tracking at any time  privacy advocates are skeptical.People have no idea that theyre being tracked and targeted, said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. It is incredibly creepy, and its the most recent intrusion into our privacy.The Federal Trade Commission has brought a number of cases related to mobile device tracking and the collection of geolocation information. In 2013, the agency settled charges with the company behind a popular Android app that turned mobile devices into flashlights. The agency said the companys privacy policy did not inform consumers that it was sharing their location information with third parties like advertisers. Last year, the agency settled charges against Nomi Technologies, a retail-tracking company that uses signals from shoppers mobile phones to track their movements through stores. The agency claimed that the company had misled consumers about their opt-out options.For Clear Channel Outdoor, the goal is to give advertisers tools to buy and measure the effectiveness of outdoor ads that are similar to those they use for digital and mobile ads. It tested the suite of data and analytics, which it calls Radar, with the shoe company Toms and said it found a rise in brand awareness and purchases.Clear Channel Outdoor will offer Radar in its top 11 markets, including Los Angeles and New York, starting on Monday, with plans to make it available across the country later this year."}
{"text": "After the murderous attack on the offices of the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, Je suis Charlie became a rallying cry in France and across much of Europe in support of free speech and freedom of expression. It is a sad and depressing sequel to that display of solidarity that so many European nations seem willing today to curtail those same freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism.As Raphael Minder of The Times reported from Madrid last week, a lengthening string of prosecutions across Europe offer alarming evidence that laws hurriedly enacted in the wake of terrorist attacks are being misused to stifle legitimate protest.He cited the example of two puppeteers arrested in Madrid for a show that included a play on the names of Al Qaeda and ETA, the Basque separatist organization, as well as the conviction of the comedian Dieudonn Mbala Mbala in France for a Facebook post suggesting sympathy with one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen.Meanwhile, up to 100 people are under investigation in France under a new antiterrorism law for posting comments that appear to support terrorism; in Spain, a 21-year-old woman was recently convicted of inciting terrorism after she posted messages on Twitter calling on a radical far-left group to kill politicians.These are not isolated cases, but the problem they point to is not simply one of misguided laws. The rise of international terrorist organizations and the ability of the terrorists to recruit and indoctrinate via the Internet and social media have created an indisputable threat to democratic societies, one that tests traditional boundaries between security and freedoms.Even in the United States, where the Constitution proclaims that freedom of speech may be curbed only if it poses a clear and present danger, there is a legitimate debate about what this means in the context of the sort of horrific propaganda that ISIS has spread. In Europe, limits on what can be said or done in specific categories are not uncommon, such as laws in more than a dozen European nations that ban denial of the Holocaust.Yet laws hastily adopted in the aftermath of a terror attack have a tendency to come back in forms not intended or foreseen. More dangerously, it seems an inevitable extension of Murphys law that if a government is given unintended powers, those powers will be misused. The National Security Agencys misuse of its surveillance powers, as revealed by Edward Snowden, are a notorious example, and what future leaders might do is chillingly demonstrated by Donald Trumps suggestion that the United States should close parts of the Internet to combat terrorism  and his postscript: Somebody will say, Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people.On the contrary, what is foolish is the rush to exploit fear and crisis to suppress the freedoms that define democracy  the very freedoms Charlie Hebdo stood for and its attackers sought to undermine. There is no question that terrorism requires a robust response, but it cannot be used as justification for arbitrary and unfair laws."}
{"text": "In the way that the Internet has scrambled pretty much everything, it has remade the textbook of oddball rap. For this generation, the tree of influence is short and irregularly shaped: Soulja Boy for self-started, Internet-driven fame; ASAP Rocky and the rest of the ASAP Mob for flamboyance and for eradicating regional loyalty; Chief Keef for the disassembly of traditional ideas about verse structure; Young Thug for radiant weirdness and genuine indifference.This set of reference points doesnt quite result in a unified aesthetic, though. Instead, it is a license for eccentricity, building a new generation raised almost exclusively on misfit elders, rappers who were (and sometimes still are) maligned for their unconventional approaches.Their children are, to a man, even stranger, as seen at two concerts with loads of thematic overlap last week: Lil Yachty, who performed Tuesday night at Webster Halls Marlin Room, and Lil Uzi Vert and Playboi Carti, who shared a bill Wednesday night at S.O.B.s.Some fun facts about Lil Yachty, ascendant microstar of Atlantas loopy, decentered hip-hop scene: wears his hair in thin braids accented with red beads; has rapped over the Rugrats theme song; sometimes dresses in nautically themed clothing; has a great name.Lil Yachtys songs meander and stagger  they often sound like childrens music played on a warped turntable. 1Night, his most widely known song, was used in a hilarious viral comedy video, but its effective all on its own: easy boasts delivered with a nasal swing at a turtles pace. Lil Yachty sounds as if hes laughing and as if hes dazed, one mode inseparable from the other.That said, his performance last week was as rowdy as his songs are trippy. For a half-hour, he shouted his way through his cache of SoundCloud hits: the sleepily elegiac Water on My Face, the woozy I Dont  , the scrambled Ice Water. And, of course, 1Night, twice. Even the D.J. who hyped up the crowd before Lil Yachty arrived stuck to the pneumatic-drill-intense hip-hop: Ferg, OG Maco, Young Thug, Skepta, Lil Uzi Vert. (When the D.J. played the eternally optimistic Fetty Wap, the crowd mostly shrugged.) And as if to highlight Lil Yachtys inheritance path, ASAP Ferg, an elder-cum-spirit guide, emerged at the end of the show to lend a few minutes of barking to the cause.By old rules, this all qualifies as a fascinating curio. But these are astonishingly fluid times. Among the people guiding Lil Yachtys nascent career is Coach K, a longtime Atlanta fixture who was integral in building the careers of Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane. And if you were at Madison Square Garden for Kanye Wests recent album-listening party/fashion show/performance art installation, you would have seen Lil Yachty, in a red sweatshirt matching his braids, standing onstage between Young Thug and Ian Connor, fashion brat and post-rap style muse.Mr. Connor selected Lil Yachty to appear in the show. He also brought Playboi Carti to wide attention, on the back of the single Broke Boi. Carti has a fragmented rapping style, delivering hazy boasts in stop-and-start chunks. At S.O.Bs, wearing a T-shirt from the skate brand Bronze, he performed first, casually running through sneakily effective songs like Run It, Fetti, Sauce and Dont Tell Nobody.For the most part, Playboi Carti songs follow simple patterns; he is almost an incidental rapper, more at ease with the performance of the role than with the actual act of rapping.In this, he was a stark contrast to the shows headliner, Lil Uzi Vert, who makes conviction and exertion central to his stage presence, and to his music. Late last year he released Luv Is Rage (Generation Now/Atlantic), a chaotic eruption of a mixtape. (Lil Uzi Vert has already been signed to Atlantic by DJ Drama, the mixtape legend and talent spotter.)At this show, Lil Uzi Vert  wearing a Marilyn Manson shirt by the illustrator Deer Dana  showed off a range of outsider styles, covering the distance from Lil Yachtys sleepy melodies to Playboi Cartis broken-up tough talk and beyond. Top and Super Saiyan were sinister, Right Now was comic, and Left Right was both of those things. Amid all the theatrics, what sets Lil Uzi Vert apart from his peers is his rapping  he delivers verses as if words were more than mere sounds.This was a raucous show, with a cluttered stage and powder-keg air. DJ Drama was onstage, rapping along. The rising Memphis star Young Dolph made an appearance. Playboi Carti came back out for the conclusion of the set. And at the end of the show, there was ASAP Ferg again, emerging from the wings to offer his blessing and incite an oddball riot."}

{"text": "Invasive species are bad news, or so goes the conventional wisdom, encouraged by persistent warnings from biologists about the dangers of foreign animals and plants moving into new territories.Conservation organizations bill alien species as the foremost threat to native wildlife. Cities rip out exotic trees and shrubs in favor of indigenous varieties. And governments spend millions on efforts to head off or eradicate biological invaders.I think the dominant paradigm in the field is still a when in doubt, kill them sort of attitude, said Dov Sax, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University.But a growing number of scientists are challenging this view, arguing that not all invasive species are destructive; some, they contend, are even beneficial. The assumption that what hails from elsewhere is inherently bad, these researchers say, rests more on xenophobia than on science.Its almost a religious kind of belief, that things were put where they are by God and that thats where they damn well ought to stay, said Ken Thompson, an ecologist and retired senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield in England, who wrote the 2014 book Where Do Camels Belong: Why Invasive Species Arent All Bad.Were actually moving plants and animals around the world all the time, he said. We have been for centuries.Dr. Thompson and other scientists have called for a more nuanced approach to evaluating whether the presence of a species is harmful or beneficial. Eradicating most invasive species is virtually impossible in an era of globalization, they note. And as climate change pushes more species out of their home ranges and into new areas, the number of so-called invaders is likely to multiply exponentially.Yet the notion that a species should not be judged on its origins is highly controversial, as Mark Davis, a biology professor at Macalester College in Minnesota, discovered when he and 18 other researchers submitted an article in 2011 saying just that in the journal Nature.The response was immediate  and signed by 141 scientists, many of them specialists in the field known as invasion biology. Their approach, they said, was already sufficiently nuanced, thank you very much.Most conservation biologists and ecologists do not oppose nonnative species per se, wrote Daniel Simberloff, a professor of environmental science at the University of Tennessee, who led the group that wrote the rebuttal. He added that Dr. Davis and his colleagues had vastly played down the severe harm that alien species caused.But in the five years since that contentious exchange, the idea that invasive species should be assumed guilty until proven innocent has begun to wane, the shift prompted in part, Dr. Davis speculated, by concerns over the use of chemical pesticides and the disruption of landscapes caused by many eradication efforts.Some alien species are undeniably harmful, a fact that neither Dr. Davis nor others who share his view dispute. The fungus that causes chestnut blight, for example, decimated thousands of trees and changed the American landscape in the early 1900s. The Zika virus is invading new regions, carried by infected mosquitoes that some say are being driven northward by warmer temperatures. The vampirelike lamprey, sneaking into the Great Lakes in the 19th century, gradually champed its way through the fish population.Islands and mountaintops are especially vulnerable to damage from invaders because their native species often evolved in isolation and lack natural defenses against predators or immunity to exotic diseases. The brown tree snake, accidentally transported to Guam, has virtually eliminated the bird population there.But, Dr. Davis noted, all species have negative impacts on something, and the danger, he said, is often exaggerated.A study published Feb. 17 in the journal Biology Letters, for example, concluded that alien species are the second most common threat associated with species that have gone completely extinct since 1500 A.D.But the study, Dr. Davis and other experts said, relies on subjective judgments about extinction and does not distinguish between island species  which are far more vulnerable  and land or ocean species.In some instances, nonnatives offer clear benefits. In California, for example, monarch butterflies prefer to spend their winters in the branches of the eucalyptus, an exotic tree transplanted to the state more than 150 years ago and viewed by some as an invasive fire hazard. In Spain, non-native crayfish serve as prey for migratory wetland birds, including some endangered species.And some notorious invaders can have positive effects. Western states have spent a fortune trying to eradicate the tamarisk tree, which many experts believe hogs more than its share of water and damages the habitat of native species.But Julian D. Olden, an associate professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington, said tamarisks had been found to provide shelter for birds like the southwestern willow flycatcher. Some studies have also concluded that the trees water use is not significantly different from that of other tree species.The antipathy to foreign plants and wildlife is relatively recent. While the distinction between native and non-native species dates to the 18th century, the term invasion was first used in a 1958 book  The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants, by Charles Elton  that drew on the militaristic vocabulary of the post-World War II era.But the moniker did not achieve its full derogatory weight until the 1990s and early 2000s, when academic interest in the subject peaked and the number of papers on the subject generated by invasion biologists grew proportionately.To biologists like Dr. Simberloff, taking action to head off alien species early on makes sense, allowing governments to address threats before invaders take firm hold. Non-native species are far more likely to do harm than native plants and animals, he argued, adding that the debate was a phony controversy.Whether a species is viewed as native, however, often depends on when you arrived on the scene. Much of what Americans eat was originally imported: The horse, an icon of the American West, for example, was reintroduced by the Spanish thousands of years after the original North American horse became extinct. Several states list the honeybee as their state insect. But like many other state fish, insects and flowers, the bees are in fact immigrants.In at least one case, a species that was long extinct in its native range was treated as an interloper when it finally returned home.Beavers were common in Britain until they were hunted to extinction centuries ago. But when a group of the toothy dam builders took up residence along the River Tay in western Scotland several years ago, local farmers and fishermen greeted the animals with hostility, saying they posed a threat to farmland and salmon runs and were potential carriers of disease.Scottish Land and Estates, an organization representing landowners, insisted that the beavers centuries of absence from Britain nullified their resident status, the Independent reported in 2010.Its just silly, Dr. Thompson said, of the reaction to the Tay beavers. I dont think we would have ended up in this ridiculous situation if we hadnt been so bombarded by propaganda about invasive species.Often, he and others say, invasion is just another word for change. And the only thing that is certain is that more change is to come. Already, the flora and fauna of countries around the world are more homogeneous than they once were, as globalization has, accidentally or intentionally, moved exotic species from one place to another.From birds to plants to fish to mammals, theres strong evidence that things are becoming more similar, Dr. Olden said, likening the phenomenon to the popping up of big-box retailers and the loss of mom-and-pop shops.As more species migrate, new quandaries are likely to arise. And as the human population increases, driving more animals and plants toward extinction, a species second home may be the only one it has.In a paper published last month in the journal Conservation Biology, two scientists in California, Michael P. Marchetti and Tag Engstrom, describe the paradox of species that are under threat in their native range but are viewed as invasive in other places they have settled.They include the Monterey pine, endangered in California and Mexico but treated as a pest in Australia and New Zealand, and the Barbary sheep, endangered in Morocco and other countries but running rampant in the Canary Islands and elsewhere.This is a challenge, Dr. Olden said. If we identify a plant or animal that might not be able to respond to climate change, do we roll the dice and intentionally move that species northward, or up in elevation?Were playing a little bit of ecological roulette here, he added."}
{"text": "To the Editor:The New York Times has been magnificent in advancing the United States-Cuban agenda. Thus I was deeply disappointed by your Feb. 19 editorial on Cuba policy, An American President in Cuba.Making President Obamas trip to Cuba in March primarily about politics, explicitly, as the Times editorial calls for, is absolutely the wrong approach. Cuba and the United States have much to talk about in the short time that the president will spend in Cuba, and surely human rights and democracy will be on the agenda.To Cubans, however, the message will be in the presidents mere presence there, and the respect he will undoubtedly show them. They will be truly grateful for the attention. They dont need to be preached to. Not even President Ral Castro.If the island is starting to change  and the signs are there, even if weak  it is because for the first time in over 50 years, Cubans are being given the chance to think and act for themselves. Few would call it democracy, but Cubans may be getting there.Cubans have been isolated for too long. What Cubans most want is contact with the rest of the world, primarily the United States.

{"text": "For years, two tennis players with little in common other than their love for the sport held records that seemed unlikely to be broken.Kenny Banzer is a 30-year-old wealth planner from Liechtenstein, one of the worlds richest countries. Gadonfin Yaka, 75, is a maintenance man at a post office in Germantown, Md., who grew up in a thatched-roof dwelling in a remote village in Togo with no electricity or running water.In 2000, Banzer was a seventh grader, five days past his 14th birthday, when he became the youngest player to compete in the Davis Cup.A year later, Yaka played in the Davis Cup for Togo at 60, setting the record for the oldest Davis Cup participant.The annual Davis Cup competition begins this week, with 135 nations participating across 12 divisions. In recent years, several of the worlds top players have indicated that the Davis Cup is low on their list of priorities. But the tournaments most compelling story lines often play out in its lower levels, where players from Albania to Zimbabwe play for pride, and, sometimes, records that the International Tennis Federation has a hard time keeping straight.Banzer assumed that his record would not be broken because for more than 20 years, the I.T.F has had a rule barring players under 14 from competing in the Davis Cup and other pro tournaments. And Yaka could not imagine that any country would resort to fielding a player older than 60, so he, too, believed his place in tennis history was safe.But they recently discovered that their records were broken by players from San Marino: Marco De Rossi, who played as a 13-year-old in 2011, and Vittorio Pellandra, who made his Davis Cup debut in 2007 at 66.The I.T.F. updates these records automatically from a database on a periodic basis and cannot say for sure when it recognized De Rossi and Pellandra as the record holders.The records are not without controversy. Why was De Rossi allowed to play 46 days before his 14th birthday? And should Pellandras record count, given the fact that he appeared on court for less than 10 minutes before retiring with a leg injury?I wasnt just an old man who was trying to break a record when I played, said Yaka, who immigrated to the United States in 2005 and is now a citizen. The record is very special to me, but I wonder if the I.T.F. takes these things seriously.Banzer had a 3-4 record playing Davis Cup from 2000 to 2002 for Liechtenstein, the worlds sixth-smallest country, nestled in the Alps between Austria and Switzerland. When he learned that his record had been broken by a 13-year-old, he could not understand why the I.T.F. would allow someone under 14 to compete.It doesnt seem correct or fair to me, because the rule has existed for a long time, said Banzer, who works for a financial services provider in Vaduz, Liechtensteins capital. I have no problem if someone breaks my record, but then he has to be 14 years plus one, two, three or four days. Almost 14 is not 14.Nicola Lombardini, a spokesman for the San Marino Tennis Federation, said that the federation sent a photocopy of De Rossis passport to the I.T.F. before his first match, a 6-0, 6-1 loss to Jean-Baptiste Poux-Gautier of Andorra on May 12, 2011.Im sure the I.T.F. would have called us if there was a problem, Lombardini said in a Skype interview. No one said anything, so for sure the record is ours.A note underneath the records page on the Davis Cup website says, Players must now be 14 or over to participate in the Davis Cup. But Nick Imison, an I.T.F. spokesman, said that it was likely that an exception was made to allow De Rossi to play, since he was almost 14. But he did not know if San Marino requested the exception or if De Rossis date of birth simply slipped past whoever was supposed to notice it.De Rossi, who recently earned his first ATP point and now has a world ranking of 1,774 and a career Davis Cup record of 7-13, saw no problem and was proud to have the record, saying, 2011 was considered my 14th year, so I guess it was O.K.When he returned to his middle school classroom after his first Davis Cup tie, played in Macedonia, there was little fanfare. After all, one of his classmates had already competed on the national soccer team in a World Cup qualifier.Situated on the slopes of Mount Titano on the Adriatic side of Italy, San Marino is the worlds fifth-smallest country, with about 32,000 residents and only eight tennis courts.These things are not unbelievable here, Lombardini said. Everyone in San Marino has a great chance to break records.Yaka did not pick up a tennis racket until he was 29. A year later, he was the top player in Togo, a West African nation that has not competed in Davis Cup since 2003 because of a lack of resources.At 60, Yaka played doubles during a Davis Cup round-robin match in Mauritius in 2001, after another player had overslept and missed his flight. It was a straight-sets loss, but his opponents told a reporter in 2010 that Yaka played well and even won over the local crowd.I was still beating the young players, even at 60, he said. I didnt even find out that I held the record until a newspaper in South Africa wrote something about me in 2006.By that time, he had immigrated to Maryland, where he found work as an assembler at an electronics factory. His co-workers did not believe him when he told them he was the record holder. And it was hard to prove them wrong because the I.T.F. transposed and misspelled his name, referring to him as Yaka Garonfin Koptigan.When an article was published in 2010, correcting the error and confirming his record, his colleagues were impressed and Yaka was thrilled. But neither he nor the I.T.F. realized that Pellandra had already broken the record.Pellandra, a retired businessman, was the Davis Cup captain for San Marino when he played in 2007. He added his name to the roster for a Davis Cup round-robin event in Cairo in May of that year because the team needed at least three players and he had only two.William Forcellini, one of his teammates, wilted in the Cairo heat during his singles match, and with nothing more than the pride of the San Marino team on the line, Pellandra borrowed Forcellinis rackets and took the court for the final match, a doubles encounter against Egypt.While Yakas Davis Cup experience came in a deciding match, Pellandra took the court in what is called a dead rubber, a meaningless match in Davis Cup parlance.It was a lot of fun, Pellandra recalled through an interpreter. The other players were perfect gentlemen. They hit the ball softer to me and were trying to keep the rallies going. It was like a show.Down, 1-2, in the first set after less than 10 minutes on court, Pellandra retired with a leg injury. The I.T.F. said that it made no distinction between finished matches and unfinished matches.Yaka said that he was disappointed when he discovered late last year that he no longer held the record.They are right: If he hit the ball a few times, he played the Davis Cup, he said of Pellandra.He added, Now maybe someone else will step on the court, hit the ball twice and say they have the record.At 75, Yaka no longer plays tennis, but he watches the Tennis Channel every day and roots for Novak Djokovic. He needs to work at his cleaning job until 2019 before he can retire, he hopes in Togo, where he says he will start playing tennis again.Pellandra is also 75, and he still plays doubles twice a week with friends. He manages San Marinos Davis Cup team and will accompany De Rossi and the rest of the squad for this weeks round-robin action in Estonia, where they could face Liechtenstein, which is captained by Josef Banzer, Kennys father.Lombardini suggested that the oldest-youngest disputes could be settled on the court, San Marino style.We can all play some tennis, then go out for pizza and a good bottle of wine, he said."}
{"text": "ATHENS  It was a scene of a type that could become all too common in coming months: Thousands of increasingly desperate people backed up at the frontier between Greece and Macedonia on Monday, stymied in their efforts to reach Germany. A group of angry asylum seekers busted through a razor-wire fence. Armed police officers fired tear gas as frenzied crowds chanted, Open the border!Less than a week after Austria and nine other European countries took steps to stem the flow of refugees from Greece toward Germany and other prosperous countries, the spasm of violence on Greeces northern border brought to life the perils of the European Unions inability so far to settle on a common policy to address the migration crisis.War in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and repression and economic hardship across the Middle East and Africa continue to compel large numbers of people to strike out for Europe. Germany continues to signal that it will accept legitimate refugees, especially from Syria. As the weather grows warmer and the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece safer, the number of people arriving is expected to spike, putting a huge strain on Greece, which in effect is becoming a giant holding center for migrants who cannot go forward because of the new border restrictions, but will not or cannot go back.An estimated 7,000 migrants are at the border with Macedonia, and camps and refugee housing in Athens are full or nearly so.Whats happening is that Greece is being turned into a sort of a Lebanon, where institutions are overwhelmed by the mere numbers of people, and there isnt a strategy to deal with it, said Wolfango Piccoli, a president of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based advisory firm.If Europe does not reach an accord soon on how to deal with the situation, Greece could look like a large-scale Calais Jungle, where there is no exit for migrants, the authorities are unable to cope and the migrants live in miserable conditions, he added, referring to a vast camp known as the Jungle that the French authorities began to dismantle amid angry protests on Monday.Greece, already struggling under its long economic slump and budget austerity imposed by the European Union, has requested emergency aid from the bloc to help it deal with the migrant crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Sunday that Greece could not be required to shoulder the burden on its own.Do you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone, and we were the strictest, can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos? she said in an appearance on the public broadcaster ARD.But Ms. Merkel is under intense political pressure at home over her insistence on welcoming people with legitimate asylum claims, and without much support from other European governments. While officials in Brussels have joined Ms. Merkel in decrying unilateral steps by countries along the migrant trail to limit the flow of people, it is not clear whether European Union leaders can reach some sort of accommodation before spring brings a new surge of migrants and the potential for more violence of the sort that broke out on Monday.The police used stun grenades and migrants threw stones in the clashes on the frontier with Macedonia, which recently closed its border with Greece to thousands of Afghans after reclassifying them as economic migrants rather than refugees.That move, which denied Afghans the right to apply for asylum, was effectively a response to an Austrian decision that put a daily cap on the number of people allowed into the country and that left thousands of Afghans with nowhere to go. It also promoted fear among Syrians and Iraqis, who worried that they might also be unable to travel farther north if similar restrictions were imposed.What started as a peaceful protest on Monday by people, mostly Iraqis, who have a legitimate claim on crossing but have been held up  some for over a week  by the recent intermittent closing of the border on the Macedonian side, quickly escalated to a riot.It started as a peaceful protest. People were walking on the railway line and ran up to the border singing and chanting, Open the border, said Gemma Gellie, a member of Doctors Without Borders who works at the migrant camp in Idomeni.When the protesters reached a razor-wire fence on the Macedonian border, they pushed part of it over, prompting the Macedonian police to turn people away violently, and throw tear gas canisters over the border and onto the Greek side.Some of these people have fled war, and seeing gas and hearing explosions was brought back their most terrifying memories, Ms. Gellie said. They were beyond distressed.The Balkans have served as the main passageway for migrants, most of whom hope to reach Germany, which has accepted far more asylum seekers than any other country. Germanys warmer welcome has led to tensions with other European countries, and last week Austria and nine Balkan states agreed to put in place several measures to reduce the flow of refugees. The effect has been a rapid buildup of migrants in Greece.We estimate that we will have a number of people trapped in our country which will be between 50,000 and 70,000, the minister for migration, Ioannis Mouzalas, told the Greek TV channel Mega.Mr. Mouzalas said that he believed that those numbers would be reached in the coming month, and that 22,000 migrants were already in the country.Greece is the most popular entry point into Europe for hundreds of thousands of refugees from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. More than 111,000 migrants have already arrived in the country this year, far ahead of the pace of last year, according to the International Organization for Migration.More than 400 migrants have died this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean, the organization reported, including 321 on the heavily traveled route between Turkey and Greece. NATO has agreed to patrol those waters to combat trafficking of migrants, but it is not clear whether the presence of naval vessels will deter the flow of people.The sporadic imposition of border controls by countries including Austria, Denmark and Sweden over the past few months has dealt a serious blow to the Schengen agreement, a cornerstone of European integration that allows the free movement of people across much of the blocs internal borders."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  The fifth graders in Jade Cooneys classroom compete against a kitchen timer during lessons to see how long they can sustain good behavior  raising hands, disagreeing respectfully and looking one another in the eye  without losing time to insults or side conversations.As reward for minutes without misconduct, they win prizes like 20 seconds to kick their feet up on their desks or to play rock-paper-scissors. And starting this year, their school and schools in eight other California districts will test students on how well they have learned the kind of skills like self-control and conscientiousness that the games aim to cultivate  ones that might be described as everything you should have learned in kindergarten but are still reading self-help books to master in middle age.A recent update to federal education law requires states to include at least one nonacademic measure in judging school performance. So other states are watching these districts as a potential model. But the race to test for so-called social-emotional skills has raised alarms even among the biggest proponents of teaching them, who warn that the definitions are unclear and the tests faulty.I do not think we should be doing this; it is a bad idea, said Angela Duckworth, the MacArthur fellow who has done more than anyone to popularize social-emotional learning, making grit  the title of her book to be released in May  a buzzword in schools.She resigned from the board of the group overseeing the California project, saying she could not support using the tests to evaluate school performance. Last spring, after attending a White House meeting on measuring social-emotional skills, she and a colleague wrote a paper warning that there were no reliable ways to do so. Our working title was all measures suck, and they all suck in their own way, she said.And there is little agreement on what skills matter: Self-control? Empathy? Perseverance? Joy?There are so many ways to do this wrong, said Camille A. Farrington, a researcher at the University of Chicago who is working with a network of schools across the country to measure the development of social-emotional skills. In education, we have a great track record of finding the wrong way to do stuff.Schools began emphasizing social-emotional learning around 2011, after an analysis of 213 school-based programs teaching such skills found that they improved academic achievement by 11 percentile points. A book extolling efforts to teach social-emotional skills in schools such as the KIPP charter network and Riverdale Country School in New York, How Children Succeed by Paul Tough, appeared the next year.Argument still rages about whether schools can or should emphasize these skills. Critics say the approach risks blaming the victim  if only students had more resilience, they could rise above generational poverty and neglected schools  and excuses uninspired teaching by telling students it is on them to develop zest, or enthusiasm. Groups that spent decades urging the country toward higher academic standards worry about returning to empty talk of self-esteem, accepting low achievement as long as students feel good.But teaching social-emotional skills is often seen as a way to move away from a narrow focus on test scores, and to consider instead the whole child. It may seem contradictory, then, to test for those skills. In education, however, the adage is whats measured gets treasured; states give schools money to teach the subjects on which they will be judged.Next year, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a test of students in grades four, eight and 12 that is often referred to as the nations report card, will include questions about students social-emotional skills. A well-known international test, PISA, is moving toward the same.The biggest concern about testing for social-emotional skills is that it typically relies on surveys asking students to evaluate recent behaviors or mind-sets, like how many days they remembered their homework, or if they consider themselves hard workers. This makes the testing highly susceptible to fakery and subjectivity. In their paper published in May, Dr. Duckworth and David Yeager argued that even if students do not fake their answers, the tests provide incentive for superficial parroting rather than real changes in mind-set.You think test scores are easy to game? said Martin West, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who is working with the districts in California. Theyre relatively hard to game when you compare them to a self-report survey.Students might be tested on performance, as in the marshmallow test, in which children were told they could have a sweeter reward if they waited. Those who waited scored higher in self-control. But those tests are too time-consuming to use on a large group of students.Other researchers have proposed calling or texting students at regular intervals to check their behavior and frame of mind, or monitoring Facebook or Twitter to observe patterns of behavior. But privacy concerns would almost certainly disqualify those.Transforming Education, a Boston-based group that is among the biggest proponents of teaching social-emotional skills, argues that they are so important that schools have to begin testing for them, even if perfect measures do not exist.The group worked with the school districts here  which count one million students, or 20 percent of the state total, in cities including Los Angeles and Oakland  to choose four measures to evaluate: growth mind-set, social awareness, self-efficacy and self-management.The districts tested 10,000 students in 2014, and nearly 500,000 students last year, surveying things like how many days the students had come to school prepared (self-management), and whether they believed it was more important to be talented or to work hard (growth mind-set).Just two years ago in her classroom in a trailer here at Visitacion Valley Elementary School, Ms. Cooney struggled with the kind of management problems that often confront young teachers.Her students, mostly poor and living in a nearby housing project, were bouncing around the classroom, playing with their phones instead of paying attention, fighting out interfamily beefs. Even if they wanted to learn, they were not.Ms. Cooney, 27, took a two-hour training session in a student-behavior program and began playing good-behavior games. They look like regular lessons, except that they begin with students identifying goals for good behavior, and end with her assessing what went right and wrong.On a recent day, students took notes on their reading as Ms. Cooney moved with a kind of Zen bustle around the classroom, grading papers and consulting one-on-one while she watched for things she would compliment the class on later  keeping bodies still, focusing on the task  and quietly noted bad behavior.For every 1,000 minutes of good behavior earned, the children win 15 extra minutes of recess.Im really saving minutes that would be lost to transitions, settling disputes and behavior problems, Ms. Cooney said. It can be exhausting, but not nearly as much as teaching before. As she said, Would you rather put out fires, or prevent them?Social-emotional learning will count for 8 percent of a schools overall performance score; no teacher will lose a job for failing to instill a growth mind-set.Noah Bookman, the chief accountability officer for the districts, said he understood the concerns about testing. But, he said, This work is so phenomenally important to the success of our kids in school and life. In some ways, we worry as much if not more about the possibility that these indicators remain on the back burner."}
{"text": "RALEIGH, N.C.   A crowd gathered here on Monday to denounce the killing of a black man shot earlier in the day after a foot chase with a police officer.About 200 people gathered for a vigil in the neighborhood south of downtown where, the police, say an officer shot a suspect wanted for a felony drug charge.Raleigh police did not identify the man who was killed. But people who live near the scene of the shooting identified him as Akiel Denkins, 24.Mr. Denkinss mother, Rolanda Byrd, told reporters that she understood that it was her son who was killed, but said that the police had yet to tell her.Police Chief Cassandra Deck-Brown said that a firearm was found near the suspect. She said the shooting would be investigated by the State Bureau of Investigation and by the Police Departments internal affairs unit.I ask everyone to please be patient while the follow-up investigations are conducted to determine the facts about what happened today, she said.The police later identified the officer as Senior Officer D.C. Twiddy, 29, The Associated Press reported.The scene of the shooting turned tense in its aftermath, as people yelled at officers across yellow crime scene tape.By nightfall, people had gathered on Bragg Street for the vigil, where local pastors and activists gave speeches and the crowd chanted, Black lives matter. Some held photographs of Mr. Denkins.My heart was broken today when I heard, Phillip Walker, the pastor of Mount Pleasant Worship and Outreach Center, told the crowd. Lets work this out.State records show Mr. Denkins had three misdemeanor drug convictions and was sentenced to probation each time.Ms. Byrd told reporters that her son had a warrant out for his arrest for failure to appear and that she believed that was why he ran.Who doesnt if he doesnt want to go to jail? she said.Chief Deck-Brown had been scheduled to meet Monday with the mayor and City Council to discuss equipping officers with body cameras, but the meeting was postponed because of the shooting."}
{"text": "J. Michael Pearson is back as chief executive of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, but with less power and no glory. He is no longer chairman of the drug makers board.The company on Sunday also withdrew its earnings guidance and will further delay reporting its 2015 results.Two months of convalescence may have helped Mr. Pearsons health, but marginally better-looking governance isnt enough to give investors like William A. Ackman much hope of reversing losses.The reporting delay will fan fears that Valeants accounting has been too aggressive, and that the restatements from the company are only the beginning. Even if audited figures for last year are published soon, Mr. Pearsons room for maneuvering is shrinking.His companys stock has plunged more than 70 percent since last August as the acquisition machine that attracted backers like Mr. Ackmans Pershing Square Capital Management has seized up and accounting problems have emerged. Moreover, Valeant has more than $30 billion of debt. The combination effectively rules out using either paper or borrowed cash to buy more.Valeant is now avoiding substantial price increases on most drugs  another aspect of its business model that attracted controversy  and is ramping up research and development, among other expenses, which will hurt margins. The companys previous financial guidance may now be off base because of these changes.In the last bit of bad news tucked into Sundays news release: Actavis wants to introduce a generic version of Xifaxan, Valeants biggest drug with annual sales of about $1 billion this year according to analysts. Last year, Valeant paid $14.5 billion including debt for Salix Pharmaceuticals, which owned the compound. The company says patents protect it for another 14 years, but these are relatively weak and a generic alternative is likely to appear sooner. The chances of recouping the cost of buying Salix look low.Combined, Valeant spent more than $30 billion on acquisitions. If Salix, the companys biggest deal, is a guide, then it overpaid in some cases. That means Pearson will have a debt hangover to deal with. Making it over the hump will require cautious efforts for years to extract enough cash to repay bondholders. Thats unlikely to give stock investors much to get excited about."}
{"text": "As she began Rachmaninoffs Lilacs during her program of Russian songs at the Metropolitan Opera on Sunday afternoon, Anna Netrebko stepped away from her accompanist and walked to one side of the stage, where two enormous vases of flowers stood. Caressing some blossoms in her hands, she tenderly sang the lyrics, the thoughts of a sorrowful young woman comforted by the happiness that lives in the lilacs.Dressed in a white sequined gown and wearing a jeweled headband, her dark tresses dangling, Ms. Netrebko looked like the exotic star of a one-character opera. Even during the reflective phrases of this Rachmaninoff song, she sounded resplendent, her voice rich and vibrant, with a touch of earthy colorings. The flowers in the vases were actually cherry blossoms. No matter. When the great Anna Netrebko, summoning her magnificent voice and full dramatic conviction, describes the flowers she is cradling as lilacs, they become lilacs.The vast Met does not suit the intimate genre of song, one reason so few recitals are presented there. On Sunday, the orchestra pit was raised to stage level, allowing Ms. Netrebko and her accompanist, the distinguished pianist Malcolm Martineau, to be placed in front of the curtain, with a row of wood panels behind them to project the sound. Still, it made sense for this particular program to be performed at the Met. The songs by Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky that Ms. Netrebko sang were drawn from the genre of emotional, intense Russian romances, music that invites rich, passionate operatic singing. Ms. Netrebko was in her element.She offered only one true opera aria, a mini-mad scene for Marfa, the title character of Rimsky-Korsakovs The Tsars Bride, in which the young woman, succumbing to poison, speaks to her dead fianc about the joy their wedding will bring. Singing with dark-hued sound and affecting vulnerability, Ms. Netrebko captured the musics clash of longing and instability. But Rimsky-Korsakovs romance Summer Nights Dream, the work that followed on the program, in which a woman tells of the wondrous young man who visited her in a dream, is hardly less operatic. Ms. Netrebko sang with a captivating blend of shimmering richness and textured shadings.In contemplative passages of many songs, like Rachmaninoffs beguiling Before My Window, she conveyed wonderful intimacy. After intermission, now in a glamorous teal gown, she turned to eight Tchaikovsky songs and continued to dramatize her performances. During Why? the text poses questions in wistfully beautiful phrases: Why has the springtime rose gone pale? Why does the larks song sound so sad? As she sang, Ms. Netrebko stood behind Mr. Martineau, leaning against the panels, as if seeking private refuge from her confusion. Mr. Martineau played beautifully throughout the program, bringing refinement yet appropriate fervor to the music.Ms. Netrebko, a Met favorite, is a superstar, so for better or worse the concert became something of a scene. The enthusiastic audience applauded after each song, sometimes breaking in before Mr. Martineau had finished a soft final phrase. It was impossible for the ushers to control the taking of copious flash photos. (Several cellphones went off.) When Ms. Netrebko and Mr. Martineau walked offstage briefly after a Rimsky-Korsakov song, quite a few people, thinking intermission had come, started to leave. When Ms. Netrebko returned, she playfully cupped her hands to her mouth and shouted, Come back.As encores, she sang Dvoraks Songs My Mother Taught Me and Strausss breathless Ccilie. The whole time she clutched two bouquets she had just been given by fans: This wasnt a diva preening but a sincere expression of her gratitude."}

{"text": "George Kennedy, who played tough guys, oafs, G.I.s and a bonanza of cowboys as one of Hollywoods most versatile and durable character actors, and who won an Oscar as the best supporting actor of 1967 for his performance in the Paul Newman film Cool Hand Luke, died on Sunday in Boise, Idaho. He was 91.His death was confirmed by his grandson Cory Schenkel.Vicious killers, bumbling lawmen, saddle tramps, bank robbers, scowling bullies  anybody youd be foolish to mess with or trust in an emergency  Mr. Kennedy portrayed them all in more than 200 films and television productions in an acting career that spanned nearly five decades.No critic ever spoke of a George Kennedy oeuvre. Many of his films were hokey, with absurd plots and over-the-top acting. And, with the exception of his Academy Award performance and his work in about a dozen other films, he was most often a peripheral player, a sidekick of the star or the straight man with setup lines for the comedian.But from the early 1960s on, hardly a year went by without a Kennedy picture  often there were four or five a year  and he was memorable as the heavy in Charade (1963), with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant; as an Army major in The Dirty Dozen (1967); as a regular in the Airport pictures, and later as Leslie Nielsens dumbstruck captain in the Naked Gun comedies.He was perhaps best known for his role in Cool Hand Luke: Dragline, a chain-gang prisoner whose brutality and compassion as the gang leader not only revealed Mr. Kennedys rarely seen range as an actor, but also deftly illuminated the character of his tormented fellow convict, played by Mr. Newman.Besides winning the Academy Award, Mr. Kennedys performance won wide critical acclaim. George Kennedy is powerfully obsessive as the top dog who handles things his way as effectively and finally as destructively as does the warden or the guards, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times.Mr. Kennedy typically helped to make other stars look good, and he worked with a pantheon of them: Bette Davis, James Stewart, Burt Lancaster, Charlton Heston, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and many more.Occasionally Mr. Kennedy headlined the cast of a B-movie, like The Human Factor, a 1975 vigilante-justice film, in which he wiped out terrorists who killed his family. He also starred in two television series: He was a cop turned priest in Sarge, seen on NBC in the early 1970s, and a patrolman in The Blue Knight, on CBS in 1975-76.But his stock in trade was the supporting role, and his rugged but bland looks were right for almost any part. He was tall and burly, with a bull neck, eyes that widened with shock or narrowed to menacing slits, a disingenuous smile and big ham hands to grip the gun or slap the girl. In the mold of Lee Marvin or Lee Van Cleef, he was a first-rate thug, and his deadpan look was perfect for disaster pictures or comedies.In 1970 he played the improbable rescuer, Joe Patroni, in Airport, a soapy melodrama with an all-star cast about a bomber on a plane, an airport socked in by a blizzard and desperation aloft and on the ground. He reprised his role in the sequels, Airport 75, Airport 77 and The Concorde ... Airport 79. He was the only cast member to appear in all four.In the cult favorite The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) and its sequels, Naked Gun 2 : The Smell of Fear (1991) and Naked Gun 331/3: The Final Insult (1994), Mr. Kennedy played Capt. Ed Hocken, wincing and grimacing at the wreckage wrought by Mr. Nielsens bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin.In 1991, Mr. Kennedy was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ever since I was a little boy, he said, my primary heroes were movie stars.George Harris Kennedy Jr. was born in New York City on Feb. 18, 1925, the son of George and Helen Kennedy. His father, a musician and bandleader, died when he was 4, and he was raised by his mother, a ballet dancer. His parents put him on the stage at 2, and he later worked in radio. But his entertainment career got off to a late start.A military career seemed more likely. After graduating from Chaminade High School in Mineola, N.Y., he joined the Army, fought in the infantry in Europe in World War II and spent 16 years in the service.He opened the Armys first office of technical assistance for films and television, and in the late 1950s retired and became an adviser to The Phil Silvers Show. Soon he was speaking lines on that program, and by the early 1960s he was playing roles on shows like Maverick, Peter Gunn and Route 66. From 1988 to 1991 he was on the prime-time CBS soap opera Dallas, playing Carter McKay, a rival of the Ewing brothers.He made occasional appearances in films and television shows in recent years. In 2014 he was in the film The Gambler, starring Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange. He published a memoir, Trust Me, in 2011.His first marriage, to Revel Wurman in 1959, ended in divorce in 1978. He married Joan McCarthy in 1978. She died in 2014.In addition to his grandson Mr. Schenkel, Mr. Kennedy, who lived in Eagle, Idaho, near Boise, is survived by a daughter, Shannon Sullivan; four other grandchildren; and one great-grandson."}
{"text": "The daughter of Abe Vigoda, the sad-face actor who died last month at 94 and was known for his roles in The Godfather and the television show Barney Miller, said on Monday it was wrong for her father to have been left out of the In Memoriam segment of the Academy Awards on Sunday night.Mr. Vigodas daughter, Carol Vigoda Fuchs, said she watched the ceremony from her home in New Jersey with friends, expecting to see his image during the segment. I have to say it was very disappointing, and I feel that we were all cheated and I dont understand why, she said in a telephone interview on Monday.I am assuming it was a mistake, she said. This is the final curtain, this is the big one, and wow why no tribute?She said she had not heard from the Academy and would not be formally seeking an explanation, saying that should be up to his fans and people in the industry.In response to a question, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences emailed this statement: Abe Vigoda is among the many worthy artists and filmmakers we were unfortunately unable to feature in the In Memoriam segment of this years Oscars show. Vigoda is, however, included in our In Memoriam gallery on Oscar.com.[ 2016 Oscar winners | What happened in the show | Red carpet looks | The opening monologue ]Mr. Vigodas omission prompted protests from fans, fellow actors and cinephiles on social media. Viewed as one of the worst flubs of the evening, it revived memories of the long-running misunderstanding that had dogged the latter part of the actors career: confusion over whether he had, in fact, really died. Those mix-ups started in 1982, when People magazine prematurely interred the jowly, sunken-eyed actor by prefacing his name with the phrase the late.Then, as The New York Times reported in 1997, Mr. Vigoda, by dint of name recognition, became a member of that tribe of aged entertainers, politicians and others about whom one can never quite be sure: Are they still alive? Or did I miss the obituary? Websites sprang up to address the question.On Sunday night, fans were hoping for that final, traditional closure when the Oscar ceremony put aside the glitz and unfurled the mournful portion of the evening, screening a video that sifted through the boldface names of cinema who had passed in the last year: Wes Craven (director, writer producer), Saeed Jaffrey (actor), Miroslav Ondricek (cinematographer).This was not the first time someone had been left out of the memorial video, of course. Joan Rivers was omitted last year, for example.The omission seemed perplexing because other entertainers who likewise died in the early part of 2016,  like the actor Alan Rickman and the iconic musician and sometimes actor David Bowie, were featured.Mr. Vigoda was not the only person who was forgotten. The French director Jacques Rivette and the Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira were also left out, as was Tony Burton, who played the role of the trainer in the Rocky franchise. He died last week. Also missing was Geoffrey Lewis, the father of Juliette Lewis."}
{"text": "If you have somehow missed watching the Golden State Warriors this season, you might have a quaint notion of how basketball is played.You might believe, for instance, that 3-point shots are difficult. Or that players should generally avoid hoisting jumpers 35 feet from the basket. Or that, in the N.B.A., a team cannot clinch a playoff berth in February, with six weeks left in the season.None of that is true anymore, thanks to one player: Stephen Curry, a butterfly with a jump shot who is reshaping peoples understanding of the game.Jargon usually found on airport bookstore display racks has come to the hardwood, thanks to Curry. He is an outlier. He has caused a tipping point in basketball. The biggest disrupter in sports is on display in  where else?  the Bay Area.In recent days, Curry has broken the league record for 3-pointers in a season  which he did for the first time three seasons ago  and the Warriors (53-5) still have 24 games left to play, starting Tuesday night at home against the Atlanta Hawks. He has made 288 3-pointers this season, eclipsing the 286 he made last season. (So he is now No. 1, No. 2 and, you guessed it, No. 3 on the single-season list, with 272 during 2012-13.)The Warriors could lose the rest of their games and still make the playoffs. They will not lose them all, of course, because they tend to beat nearly all of their opponents, and usually by large margins. The Warriors experienced a rare close call Saturday night when the Oklahoma City Thunder took them to overtime. Curry won the game with a looping shot from a few feet inside the halfcourt line  once considered remarkable, now considered well within his comfort zone.As everyone, from players to coaches to fans, tries to make sense of Currys breakout performances, some context is desperately needed. To whom can we compare this shooting master?Basketball has had other captivating stars like Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and LeBron James, who all streaked to lasting fame. But the Curry phenomenon is different because of his size  he is a sinewy 6 feet 3 inches, 190 pounds  and because of the way in which he dominates games by scoring far from the basket, somehow stretching the court beyond its conceivable limits.It may be more useful to look beyond basketball, to two athletes who redefined their respective sports: Wayne Gretzky, hockeys goal-scoring wizard, and Babe Ruth, the legendary home-run hitter.Long before Curry began smashing records for 3-point proficiency, Gretzky was elevating statistical anomalies to an art form with the Edmonton Oilers. During the 1980-81 season, Gretzky set the N.H.L. record for points in a season, with 164, which included 55 goals and 109 assists. It was a remarkable feat  and one he quickly overshadowed by posting 212 points the following season.It was one of those oh-my-God kind of breakout moments, said Eric Zweig, an author and hockey historian. Nobody had done anything close to that kind of thing before.Curry and Gretzky are kindred spirits: quick, explosive and capable of controlling play despite relatively small frames for their sport. (Gretzky was listed at 6 feet, 185 pounds.)Curry can find spaces where its almost impossible for defenders to cover him, Zweig said.From one record-setting season to the next, Gretzky managed to increase his production by 29.3 percent.By way of comparison, consider that if Curry continues to make 3-pointers for the remainder of the season at his current rate, he would finish with 407, which would be a 42.3 percent increase from his record-setting total last season.Yet in the department of athletic outliers, Curry and Gretzky were both preceded by Ruth, who broke the single-season record for home runs in 1919 by slugging 29 during his final season with the Boston Red Sox. The next year, in his first season with the Yankees, Ruth outdid himself by smashing 54  an 86 percent increase from his previous record total.John Thorn, the official historian for Major League Baseball, noted that the numbers are actually deceiving. In 1919, Ruth hit 20 home runs on the road but just 9 at home, where he had to deal with Fenway Parks then-cavernous dimensions, which included a distance of 510 feet straightaway to center field. Ruth clearly benefited from the cozier confines of the Polo Grounds the next season.Given those ballpark variables, Thorn said, a more useful metric to study is slugging percentage  and those, too, were off the charts for Ruth compared to the rest of the league. In 1920, his slugging percentage was .847, also a record. George Sisler of the St. Louis Browns was a distant second, with a slugging percentage of .632. (He was also second in home runs, with 19.)Ruth had a profound effect on the way other hitters began to approach their at-bats, Thorn said. Where the goal was once to slap base hits through the infield during the so-called dead-ball era of the early 20th century, Ruth showed that hitting for power was possible  and highly productive.Above all, Thorn said, Ruth was great at a time when most players simply were not. In sports, players tend to improve, on average, with each passing decade. As a result, Thorn said, it becomes more and more difficult for one player to emerge as some sort of outlier. The margin between average and great diminishes over time.So it was noteworthy when Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants came along in 2001 and not only set the single-season home-run record, with 73, but also broke Ruths 81-year-old record for single-season slugging percentage (.863). Bonds, of course, later became known as one of the more notorious figures of baseballs steroid era, which may have helped explain his hitting prowess.But to have a slugging percentage and an on-base percentage so far beyond the league norm  well, thats what Curry is doing now, Thorn said.Thorn said that Currys emergence was partly the result of N.B.A. teams paying more attention to analytics  and, in particular, to the simple fact that a 3-pointer is worth more than a 2-point field goal.The math is with them, Thorn said, and thats why low-post play is kind of disappearing, too.When Ruth began to hit all his home runs back in the 1920s, baseball officials recognized the excitement he had created. Many teams drew their fences in, Thorn said, and future ballparks were built with smaller dimensions to enable more hitters to slug homers.Thorn said he could see Curry having the opposite effect on the N.B.A. He has made shooting 3-pointers look so easy, and so effectively revealed to other teams the shots potency, that league officials might have no choice but to push the line back a few feet, Thorn said. It would be a real crusher for most players  most everyone, that is, except Curry.He appears to be on another planet at this moment, Thorn said."}
{"text": "On Wednesday, juniors at 92 New York City high schools will pick up their pencils, open their test booklets and take the SAT, with no fee and during regular school hours. It is the first step in a plan to give the test next year in all 438 city high schools, which the de Blasio administration hopes will help make college more accessible for thousands of students.Participation in college admissions testing has lagged in New York: Only 56 percent of the class of 2015 took the SAT exam at least once. Many have praised the effort to make the exam a baseline expectation for high schoolers. But the initiative also raises difficult questions about whether, without significant preparation, low-income students will do well enough on the SAT to get into colleges where they are likely to succeed.The predictors are, if you come from a high-income family or a family that graduated from college, the data is there  their kids are going to do much better on the SATs, said David OHara, the principal of Leaders High School in Gravesend, Brooklyn. He said 90 percent of his students, if admitted, would be the first in their family to attend college. Last year, all his students took the SAT, and their average score was 1212 out of 2400, less than the city average. (This year the test is moving back to a 1600-point scale.)Mr. OHara said he was glad that the Department of Education was setting an expectation that students should apply to college. But he hoped that the city would give schools more money to help prepare students. His school offers yearlong Saturday SAT preparation sessions to 20 juniors, through a partnership with the volunteer organization New York Cares. But there are not enough resources for all 70 students in his junior class, he said.Low SAT scores have kept a lot of our very successful students out of some really good colleges, he said.The Education Department said that this year it had offered training for teachers at the 92 schools on the content of the new SAT and that in future years it might provide more test preparation resources. The College Board, which administers the SAT, also offers students free access to online preparation materials and practice tests from Khan Academy, a nonprofit organization that provides free educational videos.The city already offers the Preliminary SAT exams free in school to sophomores and juniors, and students who took that exam in October received a personalized Khan Academy account along with their scores. Neither the College Board nor the city could say how many students in the city had used their accounts. The College Board said that 900,000 students had done so nationally.Phil Weinberg, the deputy chancellor for teaching and learning at the department, said the goal of offering the SAT to all students was to change the culture and expectations in high schools, rather than to achieve certain scores.We want all of our students to know that this part of the process of getting into a postsecondary option is something that were going to help them do and that its going to be a normal part of their lives, Mr. Weinberg said.We believe that the awareness that were creating in the city will help test scores go up, as well, he said, but this is not going to be magic.Scores on the SAT closely track family income and education and, as in many educational measures, there are stark racial disparities. In 2015, for instance, students whose families made over $200,000 scored more than 100 points higher on both the reading and the math portions of the test than students whose families made $20,000 to $40,000. Among New York City public school students who took the test in 2015, white students scored 98 points higher than black students on the reading portion and 118 points higher on the math portion.Many middle-class and wealthy families spend a significant amount of money on tutoring or classes to prepare their children for the SAT. The College Board said that 58 percent of the students who took the previous version of the SAT paid for test preparation.David Coleman, the president of the College Board, said that while simply offering the test during the school day could have a modest effect on scores, the College Board was really looking to other efforts  such as changes to the SAT this year that are intended to make it more closely reflect what students learn in school, as well as the new free preparation materials  to try to narrow the achievement gap.Were really looking at this opportunity of all kids taking it to try to do other things that are helpful, he said.At the Business of Sports School last year, the principal, Joshua Solomon, brought in CollegeSpring, a nonprofit that provides test preparation in low-income schools. The group trains a schools teachers in a curriculum that combines reading and math remediation with SAT practice. It also sends current college students  mostly minorities, and many of them first-generation college attendees  into schools once a week to do small group tutoring. The idea is that the college students will not only do test preparation but also serve as role models.The test preparation itself is a little like taking your medicine, and students do not enjoy it very much, Mr. Solomon said. So having the college-age mentors come in and really talk about how important it is and talk about college in general is significant.The school pays $250 per student for the program, coming from its Title I grant. With juniors spending two to three periods a week doing test preparation with either the schools teachers or the mentors, it is a significant investment of time.Shazz Davis, who is part of the test prep program at Leaders High School, said that she decided to apply to the program after being disappointed in her Preliminary SAT scores and worrying that low scores could prevent her from being accepted to her dream college, which is Barnard.Looking at my performance over all, I have the extracurriculars and the leadership and the grades, Ms. Davis said. Its just my SAT scores, and I know I need to improve on that.On Saturday morning, she sat in a classroom along with three other female students while Saakshi Gupta, a financial consultant, reviewed the properties of triangles. After the brief lesson, the students tried two practice problems that involved several steps.The SAT tries to trick you, Ms. Gupta warned when Ms. Davis made a wrong assumption about the triangle.Ms. Davis also struggled with the wording of the problem, which asked students to find the value of an angle, defined as q, in terms of another variable, z.I just dont understand, Ms. Davis said, sounding frustrated. If this is the real SAT, how would you find what theyre asking for?"}
{"text": "In the seven years since Erin Andrews learned that a man had surreptitiously taken video of her while she was naked in a hotel room, she has been forced to relive the memory daily, the Fox sportscaster told a Nashville court this week.Appearing in court to testify on Monday and Tuesday, Ms. Andrews said the violation by Michael David Barrett, the Illinois man who pleaded guilty and served more than two years in prison for traveling across state lines to film her multiple times in 2008, had resulted in a daily stream of commentary on her appearance in the video.I feel so ashamed, she said in the testimony broadcast by several news outlets. This happens every day of my life. Either I get a tweet, or somebody makes a comment in the paper, or somebody sends me a still of the video to my Twitter, or somebody screams it at me in the stands. And Im right back to this.A look at Ms. Andrews social media accounts on Tuesday provided examples. On a message she posted to Twitter about hockey on Feb. 21, a person asked in reply if she was aware that the video taken by Mr. Barrett is still widely available.Another person, using the handle banksthelab, told her on Instagram, Everyone knows the entire video was a publicity stunt set up by you. #staged #ESPN #publicitystunt.On Tuesday, Ms. Andrews said that the attention had made her scared to meet new people or go on a date. Before going out, she would ask herself: Has he seen the video?Ms. Andrews said she believes the harassment she faces could have been avoided, and she is suing Mr. Barrett and the owner and managing company of the Nashville Marriott where she was filmed, for $75 million. She said the Marriott employees should have let her know that a man had asked if she was staying at the hotel.This couldve been stopped, she said. The Nashville Marriott couldve just called me and said, Were putting this man that requested to be next to you, is this O.K.? And I wouldve called the cops and we wouldve gotten him. Im so angry. Im so mad.According to court documents, Ms. Andrews is accusing West End Hotel Partners and Windsor Capital Group, companies that own and manage the Nashville Marriott, for negligence leading to emotional distress and invasion of privacy. Mr. Barrett is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, and is accused of invasion of privacy, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Marriott International, which was dismissed last month as a defendant in the lawsuit, told an ABC affiliate in Nashville that it was sympathetic to Ms. Andrews, but that the company was not responsible for what happened to her.Ms. Andrews, who was a reporter for ESPN when the illegal footage was distributed online, said that people accused her of leaking the videos to gain publicity. She said that ESPN required that she give a sit-down interview to refute the accusations before she was allowed to go on the air again.Ms. Andrews said she chose to do the interview with Oprah Winfrey because the talk show host had been open about her past as a survivor of sexual abuse.I talked to her producers; I told her I didnt want to do it, Ms. Andrews said. But this was the only way I was going to be put back on air, so we went to the Oprah show.Since the civil trial began last week, Ms. Andrewss parents have testified that the episode has made her afraid of people. Ms. Andrews, who works for Fox Sports and as a host on the television show Dancing With the Stars, said that she was in hysterics after finding out that the video had been posted on the web, and that it had been shared widely online.I grabbed my laptop, I flipped it open, said Ms. Andrews, who grew tearful as she spoke, adding, I called my parents. I was just screaming that I was naked all over the Internet and I didnt know what it was.The court has also viewed a two-hour previously taped deposition in which Mr. Barrett described how he filmed nude videos of Ms. Andrews in Nashville and in Columbus, Ohio, by using a hacksaw to alter the peepholes on her hotel room doors. Mr. Barrett has also admitted to filming other women without their knowledge."}
{"text": "More than two weeks after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, President Obama has not named a nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Instead, he appears to be succumbing once again to his persistent belief that congressional Republicans can be reasoned with if only he tries hard enough.One would have thought the years of disrespect and obstruction from Capitol Hill would have cured him of this notion. But on Tuesday morning, Mr. Obama met with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the two Republicans who are leading the charge to prevent him from selecting a replacement. Of course, nothing came of the brief meeting.Mr. Grassley issued another insulting comment Monday, in response to a demand by Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, that Republicans do their duty: It doesnt matter how much he jumps up and down and stomps his feet, we arent going to let the far left get away with denying the American people the opportunity to be heard.What does Mr. Obama think he will accomplish by talking to a brick wall?Almost from the moment Justice Scalia died, top Senate Republicans have not only vowed that they will refuse to vote on any nominee Mr. Obama sends them, but also said they wont even meet with that person.Mr. McConnell has said that the nomination will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the polls, and that as long as he is in power there will not be action taken. Mr. Grassley initially said he would at least wait to see who the nominee is, but he soon fell back in line and said he would not allow any hearings.Instead of wasting his time pretending to have conversations with these people, Mr. Obama should name a replacement for the vacancy  now. As President Ronald Reagan said in 1987, every day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength impairs the peoples business in that crucially important body.Luckily, Mr. Obama has many highly qualified candidates to choose from. Several have already been vetted and approved by Congress, like Sri Srinivasan, a federal appeals court judge for the District of Columbia Circuit whom the Senate confirmed in 2013 by a vote of 97 to 0. And Jane Kelly, another federal appeals court judge confirmed the same year by a vote of 96 to 0. During confirmation hearings for Judge Kelly, Mr. Grassley praised her reputation for compassion and fairness.It is unclear what the president is waiting for. Surely the White House had a short list of candidates in hand long before Justice Scalia died.Mr. McConnell has said repeatedly that the American people should have a voice in this nomination. Well, the people have spoken: They elected Mr. Obama twice. And in the past few weeks, multiple polls have found that more Americans want Mr. Obama to make the pick than want him to leave it to the next president. In a poll by Fox News, the split was 62 to 34 in favor of Mr. Obama. Republicans who like to point out that the American people rebuked the president in the 2014 midterm elections should remember that Mr. Obamas job-approval rating in December was 46 percent, 35 points higher than the Senates.By naming his pick now, Mr. Obama would force the Republicans to explain to Americans why they refuse to do their job and take a vote on a highly qualified nominee."}

{"text": "To the Editor:Trigger Warnings, by Peter Manseau (Sunday Review, Feb. 28), seems a curious mlange of catastrophe and complacency. On the one hand, he rightly depicts the hapless tragedy of accidental, gun-related deaths in the United States; on the other, he writes that the handful of such shootings each day does not amount to much, except of course to those involved.Actually, our very high rate of accidental gun deaths means a great deal to all of us who value a civilized society. With more than 300 million guns in the United States, the potential for anyones child being a victim of an accidental shooting is unnerving.Research by David Hemenway and Sara J. Solnick has shown that children under 14 in the United States have far higher rates of unintentional firearm death than children in other developed countries  on the order of 10 times higher. The majority of children are shot by other children or by themselves.We should be deploring and correcting the unfettered availability of firearms to children, their siblings and their friends, not minimizing the handful of accidental shootings each day.RONALD W.

{"text": "Songs My Brothers Taught Me, a melancholic portrait of Lakota Indian life on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the South Dakota Badlands, suggests a Native American answer to The Last Picture Show. As in the dying Texas town where that movie is set, a demoralizing stasis prevails, along with a lingering pride in tribal rituals that preserve a sense of continuity. When the residents don traditional headdresses and dance around a bonfire, there is joy in the air.Alcohol, illegal on the reservation, is a scourge of this impoverished community. Johnny Winters (John Reddy), the movies teenage protagonist and sporadic narrator, has a history of substance abuse and is involved in a bootlegging operation that leads to a vicious beating by more experienced rivals. In the first words heard in the film, Johnny, on horseback, warns that if you keep running a horse, youll break its spirit. He observes: Anything that runs wild got something bad in em. You want to leave some of that in there cause they need it to survive out here.Johnny is one of 25 children, from nine wives, of a bull rider who died in a fire. He and his peers jokingly address one another as brother from another mother. Johnnys embittered older brother, Cody (Justin Reddy), is in prison. When their alcoholic, guilt-ridden single mother, Lisa (Irene Bedard), visits Cody and tells him that shes found God, he sarcastically replies, Just dont make God another man you abandoned your children for.Most of Johnnys fellow students at Little Wound High School have no expectations of leaving the reservation. When a teacher questions them about their dreams for the future, Johnny, awakening from a hangover, says he wants to be a boxer or a bull rider. He also fantasizes about escaping his dead-end existence by following his girlfriend, Aurelia (Taysha Fuller), an aspiring lawyer, whos moving to Los Angeles for college. Asked by the teacher where he would live and what he would do for work, his answer is a sullen Ill figure it out.Johnny has a sweet-natured 11-year-old sister, Jashaun (Jashaun St. John), who adores him and has yet to succumb to the community malaise. The most intriguing minor character, Travis (Travis Lone Hill), is a heavily tattooed ex-convict, amateur rapper and drunk who makes cartoon-illustrated clothing of reservation life.The directorial feature debut of the Chinese-American filmmaker Chlo Zhao, Songs My Brothers Taught Me could easily be mistaken for a documentary. Its nonprofessional actors mumble dialogue that sounds improvised, although Ms. Zhao is credited as screenwriter.Because her laissez-faire approach makes little effort to fit the fragmentary scenes into a tidy portrait of reservation life, Songs My Brothers Taught Me feels more authentic than if she had chosen to impose a tighter structure. You come at the story, such as it is, as a visitor from the outside world, picking up information as the movie goes along. This approach impedes comprehension, and at moments you may be tempted to sit back and not try to make the pieces fit.For those unwilling to make the effort, Songs My Brothers Taught Me has other rewards. The panoramic cinematography by Joshua James Richards is often breathtaking. Whether the camera observes horseback riders atop a bluff or a distant thunderstorm on the horizon, you are mesmerized by the desolate beauty of the Great Plains and the changing sky overhead.Songs My Brothers Taught Me is not rated. Running time:  1 hour 34 minutes."}
{"text": "Learning in midlife to juggle, swim, ride a bicycle or, in my case, snowboard could change and strengthen the brain in ways that practicing other familiar pursuits such as crossword puzzles or marathon training will not, according to an accumulating body of research about the unique impacts of motor learning on the brain.When most of us consider learning and intelligence, we think of activities such as adding numbers, remembering names, writing poetry, learning a new language.Such complex thinking generally is classified as higher-order cognition and results in activity within certain portions of the brain and promotes plasticity, or physical changes, in those areas. There is strong evidence that learning a second language as an adult, for instance, results in increased white matter in the parts of the brain known to be involved in language processing.Regular exercise likewise changes the brain, as I frequently have written, with studies in animals showing that running and other types of physical activities increase the number of new brain cells created in parts of the brain that are integral to memory and thinking.But the impacts of learning on one of the most primal portions of the brain have been surprisingly underappreciated, both scientifically and outside the lab. Most of us pay little attention to our motor cortex, which controls how well we can move.We have a tendency to admire motor skills, said Dr. John Krakauer, a professor of neurology and director of the Center for the Study of Motor Learning and Brain Repair at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. We like watching athletes in action, he said. But most of us make little effort to hone our motor skills in adulthood, and very few of us try to expand them by, for instance, learning a new sport.We could be short-changing our brains.Past neurological studies in people have shown that learning a new physical skill in adulthood, such as juggling, leads to increases in the volume of gray matter in parts of the brain related to movement control.Even more compelling, a 2014 study with mice found that when the mice were introduced to a complicated type of running wheel, in which the rungs were irregularly spaced so that the animals had to learn a new, stutter-step type of running, their brains changed significantly. Learning to use these new wheels led to increased myelination of neurons in the animals motor cortexes. Myelination is the process by which parts of a brain cell are insulated, so that the messages between neurons can proceed more quickly and smoothly.Scientists once believed that myelination in the brain occurs almost exclusively during infancy and childhood and then slows or halts altogether.But the animals running on the oddball wheels showed notable increases in the myelination of the neurons in their motor cortex even though they were adults.At the same time, other animals that simply ran on normal wheels for the same period of time showed no increase in myelination afterward.In other words, learning the new skill had changed the inner workings of the adult animals motor cortexes; practicing a well-mastered one had not.We dont know whether comparable changes occur within the brains of grown people who take up a new sport or physical skill, Dr. Krakauer said. But it seems likely, he said. Motor skills are as cognitively challenging in their way as traditional brainteasers such as crossword puzzles or brain-training games, he said. So adding a new sport to your repertory should have salutary effects on your brain, and also, unlike computer-based games, provide all the physical benefits of exercise.These considerations cheered me a few weeks ago when I took to the slopes of my local mountain for a weekend-long crash course in snowboarding. (Crashing, regrettably, is inevitable while learning to shred.) I had wondered if I might be too advanced in years and hardened in the habits of skiing to learn to ride. But the experience was in fact exhilarating and glorious. Learning a new sport or skill when you are old enough to be a parent to your instructor is psychologically uplifting, as well as beneficial for the body and brain. It reminds you that your body can still respond, that it can still yearn for movement and speed.By the end of the second day, I attempted my first moguls on a snowboard and completed precisely one turn before auguring hindside into the slope and slipping and picking my way down the rest of the run. But one mogul turn was 100 percent more than I had managed before. I now aim to return to the mountain and double that number to two turns, which is how we learn and progress and, with luck, change our minds  both literally and about our limits.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "Hillary Clinton took full command of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday as she rolled to major victories over Bernie Sanders in Texas, Virginia and across the South and proved for the first time that she could build a national coalition of racially diverse voters that would be crucial in the November election.Based on results from Democratic primaries and caucuses in 11 states, Mrs. Clinton succeeded in containing Mr. Sanders to states he was expected to win, like Vermont and Oklahoma, and overpowering him in predominantly black and Hispanic areas that were rich in delegates needed for the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton, who also won Massachusetts and showed notable strength among Southern white voters, came away with a strong delegate lead over Mr. Sanders  notably larger than the one that Barack Obama had over her at this point in the 2008 presidential race.What a super Tuesday! Mrs. Clinton declared to cheers at a victory rally in Miami. In her recent signature line mocking Donald J. Trumps slogan, she said: America never stopped being great. We have to make America whole  fill in whats been hollowed out.The rhetoric were hearing on the other side has never been lower, she added. Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong, and were not going to let it work. As the crowd broke out in chants of U.S.A., she said, Whether we like it or not, were all in this together, my friends, and we all have to do our part.The contests on Tuesday were well suited to Mrs. Clintons strengths: her popularity with minority voters, her political kinship with Southern Democrats from her two decades in Arkansas, and her success in delegate-rich Texas in 2008. She won sizable victories in Arkansas as well as Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, with especially big margins in counties with many blacks.Mr. Sanderss advisers, in turn, described Tuesday as their candidates most difficult moment on the primary calendar, given the diverse electorate, the relative lack of states with huge liberal populations, and the dearth of caucuses  a format that Mr. Sanders believes favors him. He won the caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota on Tuesday; Mrs. Clinton won earlier caucuses in Iowa and Nevada.While even the poorest showing would not drive Mr. Sanders from the presidential race, his advisers said, Mrs. Clinton was already looking past her party rival on Tuesday to the leading Republican candidate, Mr. Trump, saying she was very disappointed that he initially refused to disavow support from David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.We cant let organizations and individuals that hold deplorable views about what it means to be an American be given any credence at all, Mrs. Clinton told reporters while campaigning at a coffee shop in Minnesota. Im going to continue to speak out about bigotry wherever I see it or hear about it.Mr. Sanders, who has also criticized Mr. Trump over the Duke endorsement, cast his ballot in the Vermont primary on Tuesday and held a victory party shortly after he was declared the winner there at 7 p.m. Choosing not to wait and see the results in other states, Mr. Sanders sounded defiant at times and philosophical at others as he spoke to a hometown crowd of cheering admirers near Burlington.I know Secretary Clinton and many of the establishment people think Im looking and thinking too big, Mr. Sanders said of his proposals for free public college and Medicare for all. I dont think so!By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates, he predicted. We have come a very long way in 10 months.The closest race of the night was in Massachusetts, where Mr. Sanders campaigned aggressively and where many liberals shared his politics and had elected his ideological ally, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But Mrs. Clinton, buoyed by strong support in the greater Boston area and working-class towns like Lowell, New Bedford and Springfield, edged out Mr. Sanders, who fared best in western Massachusetts and towns bordering Vermont and New Hampshire.Mrs. Clinton, who won Massachusetts comfortably in 2008, visited on Monday, and former President Bill Clinton held events that night and on Tuesday.Going into the nationwide contests, Mrs. Clinton held a delegate lead of 91 to 65 over Mr. Sanders. About 880 of the 4,765 total delegates were at stake on Tuesday; under party rules, they will be awarded proportionally based on vote tallies for each of the candidates, with Democratic-leaning congressional districts and areas assigned the most delegates.Mrs. Clinton was set to win at least 150 more delegates than Mr. Sanders from Tuesdays states; the final delegate allocation will be determined in the coming days. That outcome would give Mrs. Clinton a bigger lead than Mr. Obama eventually established in 2008, which she was unable to overcome. The delegate haul resulted from a broad cross-section of support for Mrs. Clinton: In Alabama, Georgia and Virginia, blacks accounted for more than half the population in some districts, while Hispanics dominated many of the districts in Texas that allocated delegates on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton had some of her best results in these regions, and also did well in largely white areas of the south.Mrs. Clinton won about six in 10 white voters in Alabama and Arkansas, and she performed strongly in white rural parts of Virginia, Tennessee and Georgia  results that her advisers highlighted as evidence that she could do well with working-class white voters in Ohio, Michigan and other states. These voters were a key part of her base in 2008 but are now being targeted by Mr. Sanders as well as Mr. Trump.We have the makings of a broad-based diverse coalition that could not just power her to the nomination but make for a winning coalition in a general election, said Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman. But having said that, I think we have room to grow in certain areas.Mrs. Clinton herself signaled that she would be more focused on the working-class white voters who have flocked to Mr. Trump. At her Miami rally, she vowed to help lift up struggling Rust Belt communities and small Appalachian towns that have been hollowed out by the loss of jobs and opportunities. Exit polls by Edison Research on Tuesday night showed that Mrs. Clinton performed strongly with blacks in Virginia and Hispanics in Texas, the most powerful Democratic forces in those states, and leading with men, women and white voters.In 2008, by contrast, Mrs. Clinton did well with white voters and had success in some states with Hispanics, but she repeatedly lost the black vote to Mr. Obama and was never able to demonstrate that she could attract a winning coalition of racially and ethnically mixed voters nationwide.In that 2008 race, Mr. Obama narrowly beat Mrs. Clinton in delegates on Super Tuesday, which unfolded in 22 states including New York and New Jersey and featured more caucuses than this years contests. Mr. Obama did not secure his impregnable 100-delegate lead over Mrs. Clinton until an 11-state winning streak after Super Tuesday; Mrs. Clinton, in other words, is better positioned than Mr. Obama was to make Super Tuesday a turning point when she solidifies a huge lead over Mr. Sanders.Weve always said March was a critical month, said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clintons chief strategist. Youve got more than 20 percent of the delegates decided tonight. Tonight was the night when the delegate count will become more paramount and will continue to be what people focus on going forward.Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the campaign stopped polling in Super Tuesday states last week to husband resources because the Sanders team did not need polls to tell them that they were facing a rough patch on Tuesday. He said that campaign advisers would huddle on Wednesday to develop strategy on the most politically advantageous states and areas to spend money in hopes of rebounding in the delegate race.Michigan, Washington State, Wisconsin, even New York are good terrain for Bernies message and for us to execute our strategy to keep competing, Mr. Devine said of the coming contests. And we have good terrain coming up in Kansas and Nebraska. And I think we have a real, real good shot in Maine, which holds Democratic caucuses this Saturday but has only 30 delegates at stake.With 11 more states behind them, Clinton advisers say her most urgent  and trickiest  task will not be to tear down Mr. Sanders, but to show him respect so that his legions of young voters and lower-income white supporters will ultimately embrace her candidacy.That goal will be met with sustained criticism from the Sanders camp about Mrs. Clintons paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and her reliance on a super PAC. Next week, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton will debate each other in Flint, Mich., and in Miami.A Clinton aide said the contests in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina required a pointed and prolonged effort to raise doubts about the effectiveness of Mr. Sanderss proposals, but that the wider range of states with primaries and caucuses in March calls for a more general message.People close to Mrs. Clinton believe that Mr. Sanderss fund-raising prowess will diminish after his losses on Tuesday, preventing him from continuing to challenge her until the convention in July, a possibility that appeared plausible early last month when he raised $8 million in online donations in the 48 hours after his 22-point victory in New Hampshire."}

Renovated in 2014, this 6,400-square-foot home sits on a quarter-acre on the slopes of Lions Head mountain, a short stroll from Cliftons white sand beaches.The homes open-plan living spaces are wrapped around an interior courtyard with foldaway glass doors and a retractable electric glass roof. There is a large dining room as well as a covered dining terrace facing the water. The kitchen has a walk-in cold room, bright red high-gloss lacquer cabinets and black Caesarstone countertops.All four bedrooms face the ocean and have en-suite baths. Additional features in the master suite include a sun deck, a circular, free-standing bathtub and a double rain shower.The private yard in back has a barbecue area, whirlpool and swimming pool. One wall of the pool is glass, so that when one sits in the courtyard, one looks directly into the swimming pool, said Adrien Epstein, an agent with Dogon Group Properties in Cape Town, which has the listing for the home. Other amenities include a 300-bottle wine cellar and a sauna.The home has staff accommodations consisting of a bedroom, a living area, a kitchen and a bath. The attached garage holds four cars.Clifton is renowned for its four beaches, as well as its cliffside homes and reliably turquoise-tinted water. Nearby Camps Bay is a tourist haven, with its busy beachfront strip of restaurants, shops and bars. Lions Head looms over all this beach activity, one among a chain of mountains that form Table Mountain National Park, the dramatic backdrop for Cape Town life. The mountain views are to some more stunning than the ocean, said Amanda Croker, an agent with Engel & Vlkers in Cape Town.MARKET OVERVIEWThe combination of a favorable exchange rate, a shortage of available properties (partly because of a diminishing supply of developable land) and the pleasant climate has driven up prices along Cape Towns Atlantic coast at unprecedented rates, agents say.With the downturn in the local currency, its making it very cheap for foreigners to buy, said Denise Dogon, the chief executive and founder of Dogon Group Properties.Over the last year, prices across all ranges have risen an average of 25 percent to 30 percent, with luxury apartment values escalating the most, said Laurie Wener, managing director for the Western Cape region for Pam Golding Properties, a real estate firm covering sub-Saharan Africa.The Atlantic seaboard has really become the place where people want to retire, she said. There are some very luxurious apartments to choose from with views of sea and mountains. And from an investment point of view, its a very recession-proof market. Its quite densely populated, but prices hold.While Clifton boasts some of the most expensive real estate in South Africa, with top-tier properties trading at well over 100 million rand ($6.2 million), according to Ms. Croker, other beach communities are gaining ground. For example, she said, Camps Bay broke its record sale price three times last year, with the new high now being 46 million rand, about $2.9 million.WHO BUYS IN CAPE TOWNCape Town is particularly desirable for European buyers because it can be reached via a manageable overnight flight with minimal time change. People come for just a few months or half the year  usually between September and April, the warmest months, Ms. Wener said.While foreign buyers used to be predominantly English, Irish or German, the mix has broadened to include Italians, French, Scandinavians, Swiss and Eastern Europeans, Ms. Croker said. More South Africans from outside the area are also buying along Cape Towns coast, a trend that has been helped along by the telecommuting lifestyle.As for buyers from the United States, we see the odd American, she said, but with the long haul across the date line, they are few and far between.BUYING BASICSThere are no legal restrictions on foreigners buying property in South Africa, but there is a ceiling on their borrowing ability. Nonresidents can borrow up to half of the purchase price from a local bank, so long as they can provide proof of earnings and comply with other laws aimed at curbing money laundering, according to information provided by Pam Golding Properties.The buyer pays for the lawyer, who handles the transaction for both parties. The real estate agent commission is included in the purchase price and payable by the seller.I do also recommend that my purchasers get an engineers report on any property that they are contemplating purchasing for their ease of mind, Ms. Croker said. The cost is usually 5,000 to 7,000 rand (about $310 to $430).WEBSITESTable Mountain National Park: www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/City of Cape Town official site: www.capetown.gov.zaLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Afrikaans and Xhosa, among others; South African rand (1 rand = $0.062)TAXES AND FEESThe property taxes on this listing are roughly $6,000 annually. As of March 1, the transfer duty, paid by the buyer, rose to 13 percent of the purchase price for properties about 10 million rand (about $620,000), according to Ms. Dogon. On properties priced below that, it remains 11 percent.CONTACTDenise Dogon, Dogon Group Properties, (011 27) 82 449 6608; dogongroup.com"}
{"text": "Less than a year ago, Zynga, the online games maker behind Words With Friends and other titles, brought back its founder, Mark Pincus, to run the struggling company.On Tuesday, Zynga said Mr. Pincus would leave as chief executive once again.Zynga, based in San Francisco, appointed Frank Gibeau, a board member and longtime game industry executive, as its chief executive as of March 7. Mr. Pincus will become executive chairman.The changes in the executive suite at Zynga are strikingly similar to earlier management reshuffles at the company. In 2013, Mr. Pincus handed the chief executive job to Don Mattrick, who had spent 15 years at Electronic Arts, betting that his experience in the games industry could help lead a turnaround.By April of last year, that turnaround had not arrived. Mr. Mattrick left and Mr. Pincus returned to the top job. Zyngas stock now trades at $2.16 a share, lower than when Mr. Pincus became chief executive for the second time.And so Mr. Pincus and Zynga are again bringing in new blood. Like Mr. Mattrick, Mr. Gibeau, 47, worked for most of his career  more than two decades  at Electronic Arts, the publisher behind big PC and console games like Madden NFL and The Sims.In an email to Zynga employees, Mr. Pincus said that he recruited Mr. Gibeau to join Zyngas board seven months ago and that since then Mr. Gibeau had advised and coached game development teams at the company.Frank has a history of developing strong teams and shipping market-leading games, Mr. Pincus wrote. He is a seasoned leader with the experience to quickly navigate the kinds of challenges we face on a weekly basis.Zynga was once a highflier, one of the first of a new era of game companies that created social games that let friends play one another on Facebook. But as many Facebook users began to tire of endless electronic invitations to play FarmVille and other Zynga games, Facebook made it harder for app makers to broadcast solicitations, hurting Zyngas growth.At the same time, Zynga was slow to recognize that mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad were becoming the biggest new opportunity for game start-ups, helping to create huge hits like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush.While Zynga has shifted its focus to mobile, the company still has not managed to match its earlier success and has spent several years reducing its costs. The company had 1,669 employees at the end of last year, down from 3,058 three years earlier, according to filings with regulators.After paying $228 million for a huge building to house its headquarters in San Francisco four years ago, Zynga recently said it would sell the building and lease space from the new owner.While were not yet the company we aspire to be, its clear to me that Zynga has significant strengths that it can thrive on, Mr. Gibeau said in an email to Zynga employees on Tuesday."}
{"text": "An Egyptian forensics official has told the public prosecutors office that the autopsy he conducted on an Italian student showed that he was interrogated for up to seven days before he was killed, two prosecution sources said. The findings are the strongest indication yet that the student, Giulio Regeni, was killed by Egyptian security services because they point to interrogation methods, like burning with cigarettes in intervals over several days, that human rights groups say are a hallmark of the security services. A Interior Ministry spokesman said he knew nothing about the matter. The prosecution sources said Hisham Abdel Hamid, director of the Department of Forensic Medicine, told prosecutors last week that the wounds on the body occurred over different intervals of between 10 to 14 hours, an investigator in the prosecutors office said. Mr. Regeni, 28, disappeared on Jan. 25. He was researching the rise of independent labor unions and had written articles critical of Egypts government, the Italian newspaper that published them said. His body was found in a ditch on Feb. 3. Forensics and prosecution officials have said that his body showed signs of torture and that he had been killed by a blow to the head with a sharp object."}

What is your reaction to the results so far? What are your predictions for who will win the nominations in each party?Donald Trump Overwhelms G.O.P. Rivals From Alabama to Massachusetts begins:Donald J. Trump won sweeping victories across the South and in New England on Tuesday, a show of strength in the Republican primary campaign that underscored the breadth of his appeal and helped him begin to amass a wide delegate advantage despite growing resistance to his candidacy among party leaders.Mr. Trumps political coalition  with his lopsided victories in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts and Tennessee, and narrower ones in Arkansas, Vermont and Virginia  appears to have transcended the regional and ideological divisions that have shaped the Republican Party in recent years.With strong support from low-income white voters, especially those without college degrees, he dominated in moderate, secular-leaning Massachusetts just as easily as he did in the conservative and heavily evangelical Deep South.Brandishing his Super Tuesday victories as proof of his political might, Mr. Trump said he expected to consolidate the Republican Party behind his campaign.Minority Voters Push Hillary Clinton to Victories begins:Hillary Clinton took full command of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday as she rolled to major victories over Bernie Sanders in Texas, Virginia and across the South and proved for the first time that she could build a national coalition of racially diverse voters that would be crucial in the November election.Based on results from Democratic primaries and caucuses in 11 states, Mrs. Clinton succeeded in containing Mr. Sanders to states he was expected to win, like Vermont and Oklahoma, and overpowering him in predominantly black and Hispanic areas that were rich in delegates needed for the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton, who also won Massachusetts and showed notable strength among Southern white voters, came away with a strong delegate lead over Mr. Sanders  notably larger than the one that Barack Obama had over her at this point in the 2008 presidential race.Students: Read both pieces, then tell us  How do you feel about the Super Tuesday wins? If you could vote, would either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump be your candidate? Why or why not? If neither of these candidates appeals to you, for which candidate still in the race would you vote? Why do you think Mr. Trump is overwhelming his rivals, even as many in his party refuse to rally around him? Do you think he could win the Republican nomination? Become president? If so, what is your reaction to that? Do you think Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination, or do you think Bernie Sanders can still prevail? What is your reaction to either of these candidates as president? Why? Do you consider yourself a Democrat, a Republican or an Independent?

{"text": "More than 2,000 people accused of being witches have been killed in India over the last 15 years in poor, remote areas of the northeast.The victims, nearly all of them women, have been swept up in modern-day witch hunts, often accused by a neighbor or family member who might blame devious sorcery for a bad harvest or an unexplained illness. But the allegations sometimes stem from personal disputes over property and the land rights of women.For three decades, Birubala Rabha, an activist, has fought to end this violent, retrograde practice of punishing women accused of witchcraft. She works with state legislators and residents of rural villages to investigate accusers and protect victims and their families. A videojournalist, Vikram Singh, traveled to Assam State to report on Ms. Rabhas work."}
{"text": "Open eBooks, a program making thousands of best-selling books available for free to low-income children, signed up roughly 50,000 users on its first day, according a report by the projects partner organizations.Started on Feb. 24 with a video message from Michelle Obama, Open eBooks allows adults working in libraries, schools, shelters, hospitals and other settings to request access for the children they serve. The books, provided by more than 10 publishers, are selected by a curation corps and can be downloaded through an app on the childrens own mobile devices. (According to a study released last year, 85 percent of families below the poverty line with children aged between 6 and 13 own a tablet or a smartphone.)The nongovernmental effort, which guarantees access over the next three years to inventory valued at $250 million, is a partnership between the Digital Public Library of America, the New York Public Library and First Book, a nonprofit group founded in 1992 to provide books and educational materials to children in need. The distributor Baker & Taylor provided content support.Dan Cohen, the executive director of the Digital Public Library of America, wrote in a blog post that the program would go beyond the e-book loans already offered by public libraries.Qualified kids will be able to read any of these ebooks on a whim, and at the same time, unlike with apps that require a reader to check a book back in before it can be read by someone else, Mr. Cohen wrote. This is truly all you can read for children in low-income areas of the United States."}
{"text": "UNITED NATIONS  When the World Health Organization wanted to know how the war in Syria was affecting the mental health of those forced to flee their homes, the agency hired someone known less for her expertise than for her connections: The consultant, Shukria Mekdad, is the wife of Faisal Mekdad, the deputy foreign minister of Syria and a powerful defender of the governments war effort.Her appointment has led critics to question the aid agencys impartiality.Jennifer Leaning, a professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, questioned what she called the optics of hiring a senior Syrian government officials wife as a consultant on something as sensitive as mental health. Not least, Ms. Leaning said, it would call into question any data Mrs. Mekdad gathers on the mental health of Syrians displaced by a war her husband has helped prosecute.At this point it reflects a degree of tone-deafness that is not appropriate, Ms. Leaning said.The W.H.O. chief in Damascus, Elizabeth Hoff, defended the choice, saying that her team includes people from all political camps. I didnt recruit them based on their names or their connections, Ms. Hoff said. I also have people in my office who are strongly with the opposition.Mrs. Mekdad, she went on, plays no prominent role in the office, and was brought on as a consultant for the mental health assessment project after she had served in the United Nations resident representatives office in Syria.United Nations aid agencies can work in a country only with the blessings of the government. And they are often accused of bending over backward to satisfy the demands of that government to be able to operate.The W.H.O. has been widely criticized for not ringing the alarm early enough on the threat of Ebola in West Africa, in part because of political meddling by government officials there to play down the threat.In Syria, even with Mrs. Mekdads involvement, its not as if the health agency has had an easy time. According to Ms. Hoff, Syrian security forces have repeatedly taken medical supplies from aid convoys going into rebel-held areas, including rehydration salts, which are used to treat children with diarrhea.On Wednesday, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator for Syria, Stephen OBrien, told the Security Council that the health ministry had prohibited aid convoys from reaching around 30,000 people in recent weeks.It is part of a pattern that United Nations officials have long described as government obstructionism. Mr. OBrien said United Nations convoys this year have reached less than a quarter of 487,000 Syrians long cut off from food and medicines. Humanitarian operations cannot continue to be bogged down by unnecessary and unacceptable restrictions, obstructions and deliberate delays that are costing people their lives, he said.His briefing comes three days before a planned cessation of hostilities that has been negotiated by American and Russian diplomats. It is to apply to most of Syria, starting at midnight Saturday, and officials hope it will allow for the sustained delivery of aid.The frustration with the United Nations in Syria stems in part from the fact that, for the first three years of the conflict, its agencies refused to send humanitarian convoys into opposition-held areas because the government wouldnt allow it.At the time, United Nations officials said privately that if they delivered aid to areas controlled by groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad without an explicit nod from the Security Council, they would lose their access to those in need who lived in government-held areas.Aid started flowing into rebel-held parts of the country only after the Security Council authorized it in 2014. In December 2015, United Nations convoys delivered food for 2.5 million people.Still, even 18 months after that Security Council measure, the United Nations finds it difficult reaching more than 4.5 million people living in what it calls besieged and hard-to-reach areas. United Nations officials have repeatedly appealed to the government to lift obstacles.Syrian doctors have criticized W.H.O. too, pointing out that, until recently, the agency has been all but silent about the attacks on hospitals and health centers in opposition-held areas.An advocacy group, Physicians for Human Rights, has documented more than 346 attacks on hospitals and health centers since the war began, many in the last few months, as the violence has escalated. The W.H.O. has recently issued two public statements.W.H.O. could have done more earlier, for sure, said Tawfiq Chamaa, of the Union of Syrian Medical Organizations, which operates clinics in opposition areas. They are doing better than before but we would like to have all the U.N.-related structures to help us more, to obtain humanitarian corridors and stop bombing hospitals.For his part, Mr. OBrien, insisted that the United Nations strives to deliver aid in a neutral and impartial way and that the charges of coziness with the government were unfounded.The W.H.O. in Damascus has not specifically said why it chose Mrs. Mekdad to carry out the mental health assessment: There are no publicly available documents that show her qualifications, nor any scholarly papers written by her on the subject.Dr. Annie Sparrow, a public health advocate and one of the W.H.O.s most outspoken critics, wrote in an essay in Foreign Affairs that the agency has been making accommodation to the government.Ms. Mekdads husband, Faisal, is a longtime diplomat and was his countrys top envoy to the United Nations from 2003 to 2006. He is a staunch supporter of Mr. Assad, and he is among the senior government officials who has met with United Nations diplomats pleading for access to deliver humanitarian aid.Mrs. Mekdads Facebook profile reveals little about her professional qualifications, but includes bits of her personal interests: She likes Edith Wharton, President Assad and his political party."}
{"text": "This past weekend, the artist Mark Dion was standing in the midst of his apartment in Upper Manhattan, looking very relaxed after having just dispatched boxes upon boxes  which were filled with countless smaller boxes  from his living room down to Chelsea for his latest gallery showing. When I say this room was full, he said genially with a sweep of both arms, I mean it was full. It was mayhem. But now its calmed down again.Which was only partially true. Dion and his wife, the artist Dana Sherwood, live amongst a lovely and quirky mlange of objects  taxidermy and coral specimens and curios  not unlike the Renaissance wunderkammers that have long inspired his work. As an artist, but also an explorer, collector and environmental activist, Dion has long been fascinated with the intersection of chaos and order  specifically, our attempts to impose the latter on the former through scientific disciplines such as archaeology and taxonomy. And for much of his career, this preoccupation has found beautiful expression in his use of the cabinet  both as a piece of sculpture and as a metaphor for how people have tamed nature and arranged artifacts to make (sometimes dubious) meaning. Im interested in how objects in a cabinet become almost pictoral, he says. But at the same time, they never leave the realm of being actual objects and not merely representations.For his new show, which opens today at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, he continues this examination of the cabinet in its various guises, whether its a 17th-century kunstkammer, a trophy cupboard or even an aviary. By choosing specific kinds of display cases, Im framing things within different intellectual traditions  whether thats the wunderkammer, which still has one foot in the hermetic and magic tradition, or the Enlightenment museum with its more scientific approach, he says.Dion is a soft-spoken and humorous polymath, whose interests sprawl in every direction. Spend an afternoon with him, and you will hear him discoursing eloquently on any subject you might bring up, from evolutionary theory to the workings of modern capitalism to the films of Peter Greenaway (whose obsession with systems of representation, be they numbers or zoology, overlaps with his own). All the while, he will constantly range around his home to retrieve numerous treasures and trinkets to animate his points.And while he is often described as a collector of objects (Im definitely a lover of things, he tells me, and a true believer that things speak), he is also a collector of ideas, mining and inspecting and artfully juxtaposing ideologies in order to draw connections between past and present. He is a genealogist of sorts, tracing the bloodlines of Western intellectual history to ask, among other things, how European colonial expansion, environmental plundering and the creation of the museum all relate to the ecological disasters we face today.Below, he shares his thoughts behind each of the works in this new exhibition.Since about 1995, Ive done a series of works in which people enter the space of living birds. Theres a sizable cage here with zebra finches and canaries, and people can go in. At the center is a tree that has a degree of Frankenstein-ness to it, with artificially joined branches. And on this tree are lots of material objects referencing how birds intersect with human culture: implements, postcards, images of people like Poe or Flaubert. There are cages and cats and literature from The Raven to To Kill a Mockingbird. These all speak of how people have tried to make birds serviceable to some human message. The idea is based on this absurdist conceit of a library for birds. But of course, there are birds defecating on the books, and their indifference to this human knowledge is rather striking.This piece works best when people take their time, because when you go into the cage, the birds will get as far away from you as they can. But if you slow down and stay quiet, they will adjust to you very quickly and will easily land on you. It is about measuring our distance from another animal with a very close encounter.Im very interested in how a collection happens by accident in an institution. In 2013, I was artist in residence at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. It originally took in aristocratic people with psychiatric issues, and now its a cutting-edge facility treating everything from eating disorders to the criminally insane. To commemorate its 200-year history, I did a project called 200 Years, 200 Objects. Im bringing a number of those objects together in this cabinet, representing things that happened in the hospital. There is a pile of puzzle pieces, because puzzle-making is one of the calming things people are encouraged to do. Theres a stuffed cat, because one patient was an obsessive overeater who apparently had a cat living in his stomach that was constantly hungry. There are letters representing those that were censored because they were disturbing to the receiver. There are locks from over the 200 years. The evolution of the padlock can really be told through this space.The Memory Box is a shed with a shelf inside, and on that shelf are hundreds of boxes: cigar boxes, wooden boxes, enamel and leather boxes. In each box there is something: keys or shells or seeds, small books, trading cards, old photographs, childrens toys. People are encouraged to open these and have an intimate experience exploring them. I want to provoke a childlike curiosity and the anxiety of looking through your mother and fathers chest of drawers when theyre not home. Really, this piece was inspired by a memory game. You see something remarkable, you put it back in the box, and you start looking in other boxes. When you try to go back and find that first thing, it can become quite challenging. I want people to find things that resonate with them.Imagine a nautilus in what we now call the Philippines, and this thing is collected by a Dutch sailor in the 17th century whos part of some horrific colonial endeavor. He sails back to Amsterdam, and that nautilus is sold to a curiosity dealer. It is bought by a curiosity cabinet owner who puts it into his cosmological collection. It is later drawn by an artist, turned into an engraving, bound into a book  and thats the end of that chain for 400 years. We now pick up that last link through these books, many of which are reprinted, and we find that shell and reproduce it. We are building another link on the chain, but at the same time acknowledging that this object thats part of a living culture is long gone, so all we have are these representations. Were making a museum of ghosts of things.This piece is the result of an expedition to the islands off the coast of Alaska. The tail end of the North Pacific Gyre crashes up against the islands, leaving vast piles of trash. Its a striking juxtaposition of wilderness and cultural detritus. In the tradition of the kunstkammer, you might, for example, take a beautiful shell that you find in the South China Sea, and then bind it in silver and carve into it and enhance its beauty through this interplay of the natural and the artificial. These objects are the exact opposite. They are artificial, but they have obtained a kind of beauty from the action of nature  the colors have softened, or they have barnacles on them.The pedestal is such a curious convention, like the white walls of a museum. Its not supposed to exist were supposed to pretend theres nothing there. And so my pedestal that elevates this brontosaurus has a secret door, and in the compartment you can see cleaning supplies  a little dustpan, a whisk broom and a mop bucket. Its always interesting how we hide labor, especially in places like museums, where nothing is more disruptive than seeing the janitors closet. The dinosaur represents fossil fuels as well as extinction, including perhaps our own extinction."}
{"text": "INDIANAPOLIS   A cold rain was falling outside Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday morning when the Knicks arrived for their shootaround. Carmelo Anthony opened a door, ducked his head inside the arena and then shuffled across the court in socks. Some teammates were quietly warming up. Anthony eventually retrieved his sneakers.It was a muted scene on a raw day, and one that seemed fitting for a team in decline. The Knicks are desperate these days  desperate for chemistry, desperate for positive feelings, desperate for some wins at the end of a dismal month.We have to want this, Anthony said.About 11 hours later, as if to punctuate one of his worst games of the season, Anthony launched an air ball as time ran out on the Knicks 108-105 loss to the Indiana Pacers.With their season beginning to spiral down the drain, the Knicks revealed some toughness, some chemistry and even some competence. But another opportunity slipped away, and Anthony  after shooting 5 of 20 from the field, after being whistled for a late technical foul, after failing in his attempt to send the game to overtime  took the blame.Everybody fought out there tonight, Anthony said. Me, on the other hand  it was just a tough night for me. I dont think I have any excuses for that.Moral victories mean little to the Knicks (24-35) at this late stage of the season, and they could not compensate for a poor effort by Anthony, who finished with 14 points. Others tried to provide help. Kristaps Porzingis scored 22 points, Jose Calderon had 20, and Kyle OQuinn added 19 off the bench.Its always easier when everybodys involved, Calderon said.But amid so much chatter about the playoffs and so many pledges about improving their communication, the Knicks, losers of 13 of their last 15 games, are quickly emptying their supply of time and hope.Paul George scored 25 of his 27 points in the second half to lead the Pacers (31-26), who outscored the Knicks by 48-22 in the paint  a growing trend for the Knicks. Kurt Rambis, the Knicks interim coach, was more concerned with his teams 14 turnovers.If we could have taken care of the ball, despite everything else that happened in the ballgame, we wouldve given ourselves a much better chance, he said.Rambis said he had tried to find favorable matchups for Anthony by playing him more at power forward rather than have him deal with George  a quicker, more athletic forward. But there was a physical cost, Rambis said, as Anthony spent much of the evening grappling with the 6-foot-11 Myles Turner.You end up wrestling a much bigger guy, Rambis said, and sometimes that can wear you out.The Knicks moved the ball against the Pacers. They went up by 5 points early in the fourth quarter before George went to work, hitting midrange jumpers and earning trips to the foul line. His 3-pointer gave the Pacers a 102-99 lead.Anthony was whistled for a technical foul with less than two minutes remaining after he threw an elbow at Turner. George made the free throw and then sank a baseline jumper to push the lead to 6.We got tangled up a little bit, Anthony said when asked about the play that resulted in the technical.The Knicks responded with back-to-back baskets from Calderon and Anthony, cutting the lead to 2 with 29.6 seconds left. The Knicks had an opportunity after the Pacers Monta Ellis misfired on a 16-foot jumper, but Porzingis launched a 3-point attempt that bounded off the back of the rim with 3.9 seconds remaining.It felt good when I released it, Porzingis said. It feels terrible knowing how hard we worked to get to that spot.After Turner went 1 of 2 from the free-throw line, Anthony got one final look  but his heave sailed long.It has been a tough stretch for Anthony. On Monday, he showed his frustration by leaving Madison Square Garden just minutes after a blowout loss to the Toronto Raptors. (He is usually among the last players to leave.) On Tuesday, he declined to speak with reporters after practice. Before Wednesdays game, he addressed his recent behavior.It hits you sometimes, and you dont know how to react to it, Anthony said. The best thing to do is get yourself away from it for a little bit, step out of it and relax, decompress and remove yourself and look at it from the outside looking in sometimes.As for his relationship with Phil Jackson, the team president, and the strategy for the future, Anthony said: Ill have my opportunity to talk to him. I dont think thats the way to go at this point. Its about winning games at this point. But Ill have my opportunity to talk to Phil about that.REBOUNDSJimmer Fredette, the 6-foot-2 guard who signed a 10-day contract with the Knicks on Monday, did not play. Kurt Rambis, the teams interim coach, indicated that Fredette had not done enough at Tuesdays practice  which Rambis described as a rough, aggressive, defensive practice  to distinguish himself and potentially work himself into the rotation."}
{"text": "HOUSTON   The highest criminal court in Texas dismissed a case against former Gov. Rick Perry on Wednesday, apparently ending the long-running abuse-of-power accusations that dogged Mr. Perry during his failed run for the Republican nomination for president. In its ruling, the court tossed the one remaining charge against Mr. Perry and upheld the previous dismissal of a second charge by a lower court.A grand jury in Travis County indicted Mr. Perry in 2014, charging him with abusing his power while in office in 2013 when he pressured the district attorney in Austin to step down by threatening to cut off state financing to the anticorruption unit in her office. He became the first Texas governor in nearly 100 years to face criminal charges.Tony Buzbee, a Houston lawyer who was representing Mr. Perry, called the ruling on Wednesday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals a long time coming  one year and six months after his indictment in August 2014. The court ordered the indictment dismissed.In Austin, Mr. Perry told reporters that the courts ruling proved the indictment was nothing less than a baseless political attack as he struck a businesslike demeanor at a news conference. Mr. Perry, who withdrew from the presidential race in September as his campaign effectively ran out of money, said the shadow of criminal charges undercut his bid. Obviously this indictment, as it would anybody, had a negative effect on our candidacy, Mr. Perry said.Mr. Perry and his lawyers had long denied any wrongdoing, saying that the threat to cut off state financing and his eventual veto of the money were lawful. Yet as the case dragged on after Mr. Perry left office in January 2015, it appeared to sour his efforts to attract donors and break into the top tier of candidates in the crowded Republican race for president.The case against Mr. Perry began when a nonprofit government watchdog group, Texans for Public Justice, filed a complaint accusing the governor of misdemeanor and felony offenses over his veto threat. A Republican judge appointed a special prosecutor  Michael McCrum, a San Antonio lawyer and former federal prosecutor  and a grand jury began hearing the case.Mr. Perrys critics said they saw a different form of politics at play in the dismissal of the case. There are nine judges, all but one Republicans, on the Court of Criminal Appeals. One recused himself from the case. The ruling was 6 to 2, with only Republicans among the majority. Only one of those who ruled for Mr. Perry was appointed by him, Judge Elsa Alcala. A highly partisan court has handed Rick Perry a gift, said Craig McDonald, the director and founder of Texans for Public Justice.Mr. Perry approached the case with a swagger, turning his booking session in Austin into a pep rally. Afterward, he went out for frozen custard with his legal team, and over the coming months enjoyed the support of Republican leaders and a bipartisan group of lawyers who filed an amicus brief. Those lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, called the charges unconstitutional.There is no doubt that these sham legal proceedings cast a shadow over his recent political campaign, especially among some potential finance supporters, said Deirdre Delisi, a former chief of staff to Mr. Perry. Governor Perry is ready to put this mockery behind him, and his conservative legacy of an effective, conservative governor wont be the least bit tainted by an overzealous prosecutor who couldnt grasp the basics of how the veto process actually works.Mr. Perry appeared to take a swipe at both Texans for Public Justice and the special prosecutor, telling reporters that those who pursued the charges should be held accountable, although he did not mention anyone by name.The people of this state do not want rogue prosecutors, he said. They dont want rogue organizations that use the political process, use the court system, to get done what they cant get done at the ballot box.Mr. McCrum said he did not have any immediate plans to appeal the ruling. He said that the six judges gave Mr. Perry special consideration and based their decision on what he described as assumptions instead of facts. Six members on this court did back flips and created new hoops to jump through, and did everything possible, to give Rick Perry an out on this whole situation, he said.Its irrelevant, Mr. McCrum said of his political affiliation. Ive done the job that I came to do.The case centered on Mr. Perrys veto power as governor and his political maneuvering after the drunken-driving arrest of Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney. After her arrest, Mr. Perry and his aides threatened to veto $7.5 million in state funds for the public-corruption unit in her office unless she resigned. Mr. Perry followed through on his threat.Mr. Perrys critics accused him of using Ms. Lehmbergs arrest to dismantle a public-corruption squad that was unpopular with the states Republican leadership and to try to go after Ms. Lehmberg, a powerful Democrat in Austin. Mr. McCrum argued that Mr. Perrys actions crossed the line from mere politics to the criminal act of threatening an elected official. Mr. Perrys supporters said the charges by a grand jury in liberal Travis County were a political witch hunt.Ms. Lehmberg never resigned and remains in office. A spokesman for Ms. Lehmberg declined to comment on the decision.The grand jury had charged Mr. Perry with coercing a public servant and abusing his official capacity, both felonies. In July, a state appeals court dismissed the coercion charge, ruling that the law upon which it was based violated Mr. Perrys First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The criminal appellate court upheld that ruling Wednesday. The judges found that public servants have a First Amendment right to engage in expression, even threats, regarding their official duties.On the abuse-of-power charge, Mr. Perrys legal team had argued that the law underlying the allegation infringed on his veto rights as governor and violated the Texas Constitutions separation of powers clause, which divides the government into the legislative, executive and judicial branches. The court agreed."}
{"text": "Waris Ahluwalia was standing in the middle of Park Avenue Armory last Thursday night, waiting for the Marc Jacobs fashion show to begin, while a series of famous well-wishers came up to greet him.How are you? How are you? the actress Juliette Lewis said to Mr. Ahluwalia as his date for this evening, Natasha Lyonne, gabbed nearby with Zosia Mamet. You made it out! What you did was so great. It made me want to wear a turban.She was, of course, referring to the news that Mr. Ahluwalia  a 5-foot-11, nattily dressed 41-year-old Indian-born man who typically shows up at social events like these dressed in a dark custom suit and always in a black or navy blue turban  had gotten into a bit of trouble recently when he tried to board a plane.On Feb. 8, Mr. Ahluwalia was due to return home from Mexico City, where hed attended Zona Maco, an annual art fair. At Mexico City International Airport, a staff member for Aeromxico told him he would have to remove his turban for secondary screening before being allowed to board the plane.Mr. Ahluwalia refused, arguing that the airports body scanners and metal detectors made this extra step unnecessary. The United States Transportation Security Administration seems to agree. In 2010, the agency updated its guidelines to allow people with head wraps to travel without taking them off.But the airline didnt budge. Mr. Ahluwalia was escorted away from the plane, and told that he would not be allowed to fly until his turban had been removed.Soon, he posted a picture of himself in the airport, where he spent the next four hours, with the caption Dear NYC fashion week. I may be a little late as @aeromexico wont let me fly with a turban.He spent the next day back at his hotel in a kind of travel limbo, but not without generating some attention to his situation. Since Mr. Ahluwalia had acted in numerous films for Wes Anderson and Spike Lee, news of the ordeal went viral. Outlets including The New York Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, GQ and The Daily Mail ran articles, starting a conversation about the kind of discrimination people in head wraps say they are routinely subjected to.Then, on Tuesday, Aeromxico issued a formal apology on its website, vowing to strengthen its customer service protocols of our safety personnel to better reflect the cultural and religious values of its customers.The next day, Mr. Ahluwalia flew home (on Aeromxico), and when he hit the Moncler, DKNY and Marc Jacobs fashion shows over the next week, he was greeted with accolades, a kind of mini-Rosa Parks for post-9/11 travel.So howd it even end? Ms. Lewis asked. Its so bizarre.Mr. Ahluwalia said: They apologized, and theyre going to train their staffs. Which is all I asked for.Growing up in New York City  where his family moved from Punjab when he was 5  Mr. Ahluwalia said racism was not a major factor in his life. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, then went on to Marist College in Poughkeepsie. After graduation, he moved back to New York, where he became a fixture on the downtown fashion scene.Through Ms. Lyonne, an early roommate with whom he spent many a late night at Moomba (We never dated, she said, despite both of our best efforts), he met the actress Chlo Sevigny, along with Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, the designers behind Imitation of Christ. For much of the aughts, he was involved with Chiara Clemente, the daughter of the painter Francesco Clemente.In 2003, Mr. Ahluwalia was cast with Owen Wilson and Bill Murray in Mr. Andersons The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, a farce about zany oceanographers looking to murder a shark. Shortly after that, Mr. Ahluwalia founded a jewelry company called the House of Waris, which sold at Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman.But after 9/11, Mr. Ahluwalia found that wearing a turban on the streets of New York was becoming an increasingly uncomfortable experience.First came the stares from strangers. Then there was an assault in 2002 on the way home one night from the nightclub Don Hills. Mr. Ahluwalia was standing outside Joes Pizza on Carmine Street when a man walked up to him and punched him in the face. Knocked me straight to the ground, Mr. Ahluwalia said.Traveling became a nightmare. More than a dozen times, Mr. Ahluwalia said he was flagged for secondary screening. Thats why I said no, he said, bringing the topic back to Mexico City. Id said that before; this was the first time they didnt let me board.Ms. Lyonne said: In a way, I think Wariss weird Zelig-y life has prepared him perfectly for this. You have this person who seems like they exist in a dream life, and theres nothing more grounding, literally, than having this happen.But now it was time for the show to begin, and the publicist at Marc Jacobs was getting exasperated at all the people milling about. Would you please take your seat, he said, fixing his stare upon his old friend Mr. Ahluwalia. You are clearly a security issue now!"}
{"text": "One of the least understood aspects of American security policy is the use of armed drones for killing alleged terrorists overseas. These covert executions have long raised grave questions of morality, legality and secrecy. Yet President Obama is failing to adequately address them despite promises to make the program more transparent and accountable.In the last year and a half, there has been virtually no progress and little has changed with regard to the U.S. lethal drone policy, according to a new report by the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank, that measured progress on recommendations made by a bipartisan panel of military and intelligence experts in June 2014. The new report, by the Stimson staff, gives Mr. Obama shockingly poor grades of Cs, Ds and Fs across a range of critical categories.Drone strikes may sometimes be justified to eradicate threats to the United States. But to be sustainable, the practice needs to be grounded in a legal and ethical framework that can be broadly understood and defended, both at home and abroad. Many foreign governments are also acquiring drones and will see Mr. Obamas record as a precedent for their own actions. So will future American presidents.Mr. Obama has exponentially expanded the use of drones. He authorized 506 strikes that have killed 3,040 suspected terrorists and 391 civilians, while President George W. Bush authorized approximately 50 drone strikes that killed 296 suspected terrorists and 195 civilians in Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia, according to unofficial data analyzed by Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations.There is no publicly available official accounting because the administration has made little to no information public on the approximate number, location or death tolls of lethal drone strikes or on which agency is responsible for which strikes, the Stimson panel concluded, giving Mr. Obama an F on releasing information. It said the administration has provided few documents explaining the legal basis of the program and has done little to foster development of international norms for using drones outside of traditional battlefields, such as in Pakistan.The report also found little or no evidence that the administration has moved to transfer the responsibility for drone strikes from the Central Intelligence Agency to the Pentagon, where there are fewer secrecy restraints, or that it had worked to create a nonpartisan, panel to independently review drone killings.Michael Hayden, the former C.I.A. director, recently extolled the drone program in The Times, saying it offers a proportional and discriminating response to terrorists and has been carefully used, and adjusted when necessary, to minimize civilian casualties. How can anyone believe that when officials offer scant data as proof? Mr. Zenkosays one troubling unanswered question is whether signature strikes, effectively drone killings of anonymous men who appear to be associated with terrorists, comply with international humanitarian law. Of eight Americans killed in drone strikes, only one was knowingly targeted: Anwar al-Awlaki.Mr. Obama is running out of time to make the changes that could put the drone policy on a firmer legal and ethical footing. Alas, neither he nor Congress, where the out-of-sight, out-of-mind killing tool is very popular, seem to care. Without a clearer idea of what the government is doing, it will be impossible for ordinary Americans to judge whether drone strikes, now accepted as a normal tool of war, enhance security or undermine it."}
{"text": "Saying information is power, a judge on Wednesday upheld a measure in New York City requiring some restaurants to warn consumers about high levels of sodium in foods.The measure, which the Board of Health unanimously passed in September, applies only to restaurants with 15 or more locations nationwide. The restaurants were required to have the warnings up by Dec. 1, and fines were to go into effect on March 1.It required restaurants to place small images of saltshakers next to menu items high in salt. To earn the image, an item has to contain at least 2,300 milligrams of sodium  an amount many nutritionists say is the daily limit.Some chains in the city, like Subway, T.G.I. Fridays, Applebees and the Regal Entertainment Group, have already begun abiding by the sodium-warning rule, which is the first of its kind in the country.The National Restaurant Association had sought a preliminary injunction to halt the measure. It said the boards decision, which the associations lawyer, S. Preston Ricardo, referred to as the sodium mandate, lacked legislative guidance or comment from affected businesses.Arguing before Justice Eileen Rakower of State Supreme Court on Wednesday, Mr. Ricardo said that the targets of the sodium rule were arbitrary and capricious. It doesnt apply in a way that is logical or rational, he said.Furthermore, he said, the measure would cause irreparable harm to chain restaurants by singling out their businesses  which he said might steer consumers to other places  rather than including all restaurants in the city.Thomas Merrill, the general counsel at the citys health department, sought to contrast the requirement with the sugary drink ban  the highly contested measure proposed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2012 that would have halted the sale of soft drinks larger than 16 ounces.That measure was ultimately rejected in court.Warnings can be followed, Mr. Merrill argued, or they cannot be followed.The sodium measure did not regulate, or ban, the sale of products with sodium in chain restaurants, he said; thus, it did not harm the personal autonomy of consumers choices. It also did not require a significant investment by chain restaurants, he said.High levels of sodium, he added, were linked to hypertension and heart disease, and, as a result, the board had the authority to warn consumers of its consumption.After Justice Rakowers ruling, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association said it would be exploring all of its legal options, including an appeal."}

The officer, who was hit in the chest, died of his wounds.The soldiers were aiming at a Palestinian assailant who was trying to attack the officer, according to the military. The attacker was injured by the soldiers fire.The shooting occurred at the Gush Etzion Junction, a busy and heavily guarded intersection that has been the scene of numerous Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the last five months. The officer, Capt. Eliav Gelman, 30, a resident of Karmei Tzur, a nearby Jewish settlement, had been on reserve duty and was waiting for a bus home at the time.An Israeli man was accidentally killed in December when border police officers shot at two Palestinian men who stabbed two Israeli civilians in Jerusalem."}
{"text": "LONDON   The last time Gianni Infantino ran for elected office, it was an intense battle, a campaign decided on promises and vision.Mr. Infantino remembers it well. He was 18. The race was for president of the tiny soccer club near Brig, Switzerland, his hometown. There were two opponents, both older men whom Mr. Infantino described as established. He was the surprise entry, a wild card with hopes of having the amateur club promoted up the national pyramid.Many of the voters doubted Mr. Infantinos mettle. But he ultimately swayed the majority with a bit of savvy campaign bluster.I told them that if I won, my mother would wash all the kits each week, Mr. Infantino said recently, referring to the players uniforms.He laughed. And I won, he said. So she did.Nearly three decades later, Mr. Infantino is mired in an election race of significantly greater intensity and importance. On Friday, he will make a presentation to the 209 member nations of FIFA, world soccers governing body, imploring them to vote for him to become the next FIFA president  a position many people believe is the most powerful in global sports.All indications are that Mr. Infantino is one of the two favored candidates. His primary competitor is Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, and the two men come to the race with vastly different backgrounds and similarly divergent forecasts of what scandal-strafed FIFA needs to do.Mr. Infantinos track record is as an administrator. His current position is general secretary of UEFA, which oversees European soccer, and most fans know him best for his regular, if somewhat monotonous, on-camera appearances during the draw ceremonies for UEFAs various continental tournaments.But Mr. Infantino has said repeatedly that his work as a nuts-and-bolts executive and his delayed entry into the race  he announced his candidacy only after it became clear that Michel Platini, the suspended president of UEFA, would not be able to run  should not be seen as indications that he is not fit to be a leader. To the contrary, Mr. Infantino has painted himself as the closest thing to a groundbreaking candidate in the race, a person who loves world soccer and knows how it operates but has never been directly involved in the murky landscape of patronage that has led FIFA into its continuing crisis.Although he rarely mentions Sheikh Salman, his main opponent, directly, Mr. Infantino likes to allude to the obvious distinctions between himself and the sheikh, who is a member of FIFAs historically untrustworthy executive committee and has been linked to allegations of human rights violations in Bahrain, his home country.At a campaign event in London this month, Mr. Infantino, addressing reporters, said he would begin by unveiling his plans for his first 90 days in office.Why 90 days? he said. A politician usually takes 100 days, but Im not a politician.He hit that line with inflection, and while it may be true, it does not mean Mr. Infantino is not a skilled operator. Those who have worked with him, both during his tenure as UEFAs general secretary and during his previous work on the organizations legal side (he is a certified lawyer), say that in meetings, Mr. Infantino can be quick to switch between a light, joking demeanor and a grim, serious stare that indicates displeasure or disappointment.He is, those close to him said, fixated on outcomes, frequently boiling something down to its essence: Did the job get done?At UEFA, Mr. Infantino was intimately involved with the recent expansion of the European Championships to 24 teams, from 16  an initiative that is popular with European federations and a concept that Mr. Infantino has made part of his FIFA campaign. He has vowed to seriously explore increasing the World Cup field to 40 teams, from 32.In my position as general secretary of UEFA, I am dealing every day with associations, with leagues, with clubs, with heads of state, he said in a recent interview. I think FIFA needs somebody who has this track record. Not only of dealing with people, but of coming with results. This is what FIFA needs. They dont need a dictator or someone who inaugurates football pitches. They need someone who will work.As with all the candidates, criticisms of Mr. Infantino are wide-ranging. Some believe he is little more than a puppet of Mr. Platinis, not a visionary leader. Others believe he will be too focused on Europe if he becomes president. More than a few are leery of seeing FIFA replace one Swiss polyglot (the suspended Sepp Blatter) with another.More pointedly, Sheikh Salman has disparaged Mr. Infantinos plan to increase the World Cup field as pandering for votes, calling Mr. Infantinos suggestion unprofessional. Another candidate, the soccer executive Jrme Champagne, has highlighted UEFAs handling of previous corruption cases, most notably a match-fixing scandal in Turkey and a bribery case in Greece, as a way to paint Mr. Infantinos current statements about reform as out of sync with his organizations history.Mr. Infantino has spent the past few months crisscrossing the globe in an effort to combat those labels and meet as many officials from as many national federations as possible. Whether speaking English, German, French, Italian or Spanish  he is fluent in each  Mr. Infantino has tried to put out the message that he is not a European candidate but rather someone more universal.I suppose that you could say that Michel Platini, who became president of UEFA and was quite popular, was never really involved in the administrative side of football before he became president, said Jim Boyce, a longtime soccer executive who served on FIFAs executive committee from 2011 to 2015. I think a person should be judged on his capabilities.Mr. Boyce added: The president of FIFA needs to have good people around him. He needs to have people around him that he can trust. But also, the president needs to be able to delegate certain duties to administrators, and Gianni knows that  maybe better than anyone  because he was one of those administrators.Mr. Infantino concedes that he had no previous inclination to run for FIFAs presidency and that he considered the possibility only after Mr. Platini was suspended in the fall. Mr. Infantino said that ngel Mara Villar Llona of Spain, a top FIFA and UEFA official, was the first to suggest to him that he should become a candidate, and he said of his wifes reaction to the suggestion, She looked at me like I was crazy.But ultimately, Mr. Infantino said, you can sit in your nice office in UEFA and watch how everything collapses, or you can stand up, put your face out there, take the responsibility and try to do something to save football.He added, For me, the option of not doing anything is never an option.That is why he entered the race. That is why, despite being a nervous flier who struggles to sleep on airplanes, he has flown across the globe to explain his plans to all who will listen. That is why he is running in an election for the first time since his promise of a fast, reliable, family-operated laundry service helped him win one at his local soccer club.That race was a long time ago. But even then, Mr. Infantino said, the results made the effort worthwhile.A few years later, we got promoted, too, he said. I hope this election will go just as well."}
{"text": "Shift(Blue Note)Up to this point, the alto saxophonist Logan Richardson has seemed a matter of promise. He has a soft, languid tone that encompasses 20 years of full-service new saxophone improvising  precise, abstract, funky, noisy and sentimental, within the same tune. But his first two records felt a little like sketches, not fully embodied. Shift, his third and latest, and first on Blue Note records, is a totally different proposition.Sometimes emerging bandleaders need framing, contrast and challenge. Mr. Richardson has given himself the advance version of all that in Shift, with a quartet including the guitarist Pat Metheny, the pianist Jason Moran, the bassist Harish Raghavan and the drummer Nasheet Waits.Thats a pretty imposing list of names. Mr. Metheny, one of the most popular and creative forces in jazz for decades, rarely plays in bands that arent his own, and Mr. Moran and Mr. Waits have been making their own furrowed, organic language together in Mr. Morans band since 2000. No one here acts like a special guest. Everyones in for a pound, on every track. (Mr. Richardson is to perform at Dizzys Club Coca-Cola on May 20 with a slightly different lineup: the guitarist Mike Moreno and the pianist Sam Harris replacing Mr. Metheny and Mr. Moran.)Mr. Richardsons songs rest on his melodies, which are sweeping and rhapsodic and dont need a fixed rhythm to ground them. (All the compositions are his, except for an excellently crawling, spacey, dirtied-up version of Bruno Marss Locked Out of Heaven.) The melodies guide the tunes firmly for a while; then the band starts gathering inside the chord changes, getting bigger, transcending the tune and blowing it apart.This might happen best in Slow, which starts with tolling piano chords, like a dirge, until Mr. Richardson unspools his complex, circular melody in tandem with Mr. Metheny and Mr. Waits. Then the solos begin: Mr. Richardson in mournful long tones and trills and rapid figures; Mr. Metheny, at length, playing one bravado melodic phrase after another until he becomes rough and loud; Mr. Moran and Mr. Waits briefly carrying out their intuitive communication together, turning the piece in new directions, making it end in a different place.Mr. Metheny, in particular, is a big presence here. He expands to full size. The risk is that hell eclipse the leader, and sometimes he does, but not for long. Mr. Richardson holds his ground, often with ballad tones, patience and mystery."}
{"text": "Should it choose to adopt the Broadway business model for self-promoting souvenirs, the Bushwick Starr could surely do a brisk trade in I Am Clare buttons. These artifacts might be sold, along with the usual choices of bottled beer, from the bar in what passes for a lobby in this tiny walk-up theater in Brooklyn.The exciting young playwright Clare Barron has come up with a new work  a chamber piece, she calls it  with which anyone who struggled with the anguishing mysteries of sex and love during adolescence is guaranteed to identify. Thats everyone, right?This charming exercise in universal navel (and lower-aimed) gazing, which opened here this week, is called Ill Never Love Again. Directed with a wit more likely to slide into darkness than preciousness by Michael Leibenluft, the production features a choir of many Clares  of assorted shapes, sizes, sexes and ethnicities  singing melodramatic declarations from the diary Ms. Barron kept as a miserable and ecstatic teenager.Outfitted in churchly robes, which seems the right style choice for the contemplation of the sacred and profane, the ensemble hymns the magnetic and repellent attraction exerted by a boy named Joshua upon a younger high school student named Clare. Individuals break away from the throng to give voice to Clares impressions as a novice in the game of all-consuming romance.I no longer think its disgusting to think about kissing him. Mr. Penis is not a pretty sight. Romance is dead for me forever. Such sentences are spoken by both men and women with concentrated sincerity.They bring the same furious passion to the group performance of glee-club standards like The Bonnie Banks o Loch Lomond, accompanied by an upright piano. Sometimes they break into bluesy a cappella wails, intoning words of desolation. (Stephanie Johnstone is the shows composer and music director.)Just because the pain being expressed here is in the past doesnt mean it isnt real  or even ever entirely in the past. And if the early choral numbers present teenage angst within a detached conceptual framework, subsequent moments allow no such distance.A scene in which the young Clare (played by the grown-up Ms. Barron) nearly goes all the way for the first time is raw enough to make you squirm. But the discomfort of that scene pales next to the images used as a prologue for it, cast onto a suspended sheet by an overhead projector.What were looking at are smudged pencil drawings, from a notebook, portraying monstrous naked men and women and their genitalia. A couple of them are emblazoned with the words sadness overwhelming. And we recall what one of the Clares had said earlier about thinking, for the first time, My body is not good enough.Cut to 2012, a time lapse achieved by the unfolding of Carolyn Mrazs set  which had previously suggested a schoolroom as seen through the collaged inner mind of a 15-year-old  into a naturalistic 21st-century office space. Here is an adult Clare (Nana Mensah), doing freelance redacting for a legal firm, sorting through the personal emails of a couple involved in what sounds like a very unpleasant divorce case.Clare engages in cursory dialogue with employees who wander in and out of the room, and later with a teenage girl, Oona, who has come to meet her moms partner for a concert. That event is to celebrate the Mayan Apocalypse, a phenomenon with which Clares younger self had been obsessed. Clare offers some fumbling and encouraging advice to Oona (Oona Montandon), who is just about to enter high school. The words fall flat.This scene is followed by an extraordinary monologue, delivered by the middle-aged actress Mia Katigbak as the 26-year-old Clare. She describes a time in which things fell apart in her life (People left. People died.) and, it would seem, in the world at large. Clare found herself burrowing into her body like a feral creature. She stopped washing, had sex often and would sleep amid a nest of her cats.Ms. Barron, whose early work includes the cult favorite You Got Older, has the rare gift of being both oblique and perfectly clear  or as clear as one can be about the irresoluble conflicts of life. She trusts you to connect the dots from the disparate scenes and styles of Ill Never Love Again. And if you go with your intuition instead of your intellect, youll have no trouble doing so.It gets better goes the popular contemporary watch phrase, a mantra for young people who suffer for their sexual identities. But as Ill Never Love Again suggests so compassionately, the enigmas of the hearts and loins persist throughout our lives. Still, something like wisdom comes to those who, like Ms. Barron, keep their eyes open to the patterns that emerge over the passing years.The Ms. Katigbak version of Clare, in assessing the view from her mid-20s, says, Each year I understood more songs. Suddenly, she continues, a song from long ago would materialize in her mind and shed think, Oh, thats what this song means.Youve surely experienced something similar, and you may even do so before this show is over. I, for one, have found new depths of sadness and eroticism within the words the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond."}

{"text": "The unexamined life is not worth living, but A Strange Course of Events reminds us that the inspected one is not always worth watching.At least, not one profiled so sketchily. Directed by Raphal Nadjari, the film follows Shaul (Ori Pfeffer), a clerical worker at a hospital in Israel, as he decides, apparently on impulse, to visit his dad, Shimon, in Haifa. Father and estranged son have not seen each other in five years, so theres a lot of catching up to do.It only takes a few minutes: When Shimon asks about Shauls marriage, Shaul says tersely that hes been divorced for a couple of years and has custody struggles over his daughter, Michal. The white-haired Shimon (Moni Moshonov) has a surprise of his own: Hes got a girlfriend, Bati (Michaela Eshet), a gentle soul who runs a New Age-y shop in the mall where Shimon works.Shimon has issues, too  we glimpse his flinty side  but Shaul, perpetually sour, appears incapable of experiencing joy. Hes cold even with his daughter. Until the last frames of the movie, he never so much as hints at a smile. The diagnosis from the aisle seat is that Shaul is a high-functioning depressive.The neorealists, among others, made cinematic art out of lives lived in quiet desperation. But while Strange Course offers plenty of tension, what passes for drama is Shauls slip-and-fall at a fish market. Mr. Nadjari, who wrote the screenplay with Geoffroy Grison, may have been intending a minimalist character study, but even so, he has abdicated his responsibility: Too much of this family drama is left to the audience to fill in."}
{"text": "Welcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social-media presences of celebrities.The average Amy Sedaris Instagram post is morbidly compelling in the same way as a yellowed photo that might accompany a recipe for some very unappetizing 1970s-era hors doeuvre: You dont really want to eat it, but you cant stop looking at it. Im convinced that Sedaris has access to a secret Instagram filter that, instead of saturating the brightest colors or dialing up the rosiness, renders everything she posts a little off: flatter and less appealing, like someone has suddenly turned on a fluorescent light.A little off might be an understatement, actually, particularly for the medium. Its a misconception that the most successful Instagram accounts deal exclusively in perfection. Lots of posts dabble in wabi-sabi: the smallest, most deliberate flaw, the hair out of place that draws attention to the pretty face its framing. Sedaris doesnt often do this kind of Instagram-friendly irregularity. Her interest in the unflattering runs much deeper, to a full-hearted embrace of the grotesque and the uncanny, like a John Waters movie that lasts only as long as you keep scrolling.Im glad Sedaris has an Instagram account in part because the prankster photographers Pierpaolo Ferrari and Maurizio Cattelan of Toiletpaper magazine dont: She shares their winking, gleefully gross vintage spirit, the midcentury housewife who has gone totally, merrily batty. (To understand the surrealist appeal of this kind of aesthetic, look no further than the photos Cattelan and Ferrari took last year for The New York Times Magazine of dishes from the 1971 Betty Crocker Recipe Card Library.) Its an extension of a sensibility Sedaris began to establish with her role in the off-kilter, absurdist TV comedy Strangers with Candy and has honed ever since. Her 2006 book on entertaining, I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence, includes such nuggets of advice as I like when a guest shows up with confectioners sugar, light bulbs or a roll of those heavy blue gas-station paper towels. Her 2010 book is called Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People! You get the idea.Categorically speaking, Sedaris posts a lot of the same kinds of things everyone does, filling her feed both with her own snapshots and photos she finds on various corners of the web: cute animals, food, manicures and pedicures. But a lot of the animals are cute in weird, bad ways: obese or stoned-looking or dangling an extra-long tongue or looking psychotically at a piece of meat. Sedaris looks psychotically at pieces of meat, too: her food photos act, almost to a fault, as extremely effective appetite suppressants. (She does, in fact, have a thing for horrific hors doeuvres.) And rather than posting impressive nail art, Sedaris somehow sources  over and over  badly lit photos of freakishly long toenails, often ornately pedicured. If they should be straining the elastic limits of a pair of beige nylon stockings, all the better.She might post a collection of knitting patterns for Lesbian Funeral Shawls (Photoshopped, I think?), or book covers reading Donkey Man: A Womans Guide to Tijuana or If God Loves Me, Why Cant I Get My Locker Open?: Devotionals for Teens or Those Amazing Leeches (real, I think). She might post a tiny, dirty pair of dolls ice skates, framed just so; a woman wearing jorts and giant Lucite stripper heels, bending over her cart in a Walmart; a dogs butt made up to look like a human face; a squirrel cuddling its newborn  or is it eating it?One of my duties as an online editor at T, The Timess style magazine, is to maintain that publications Instagram page. As a result, I spend a lot of my day playing with gorgeous, perfectly lit, beautifully composed images: gardens, couture, art, intimidatingly classy living rooms, Rihannas face. I love working with this kind of photo, but it can be dangerous to get used to; emerging back into the real world after you spend too much time on Instagram is a jarring comedown. Used properly, Sedariss page is an indispensable antidote. I visit it a few times a week for a quick, two-minute shot of the opposite  something yucky, probably, but always surprising, after which the real world feels, well, at least not quite that bad.Sedariss Instagram works even better when encountered organically, as Instagram intends: as an intermittent interruption to your feed, a prettiness palate-cleanser, a single blip of creepy Americana to break up all the aai bowls and Rain Room photos. So much ink has been spilled about the aspirational quality of Instagram, and the medium is ideal for that. But aspiration is a complex feeling, a flutter of ambition, resignation, envy and appreciation, all at once, that lives somewhere in the upper chest cavity, between your heart and a lump in your throat. The kind of unwholesome interest a Sedaris-gram inspires is situated much lower, and feels more immediate: somewhere between a belly laugh and being a punched in the gut. It can be nice, occasionally, to trade the fraughtness of FOMO for a pure, uncomplicated double take.Though she doesnt do it as obnoxiously or as frequently as most other celebrities do, Sedaris does occasionally post shout-outs or allusions to her friends, and theyre an impressive bunch: Jennifer Aniston, Lena Dunham, Marcel Dzama, Amy Schumer, Sarah Jessica Parker. One such pal is the tattoo artist Scott Campbell, who was indirectly responsible for my most shocking and terrifying discovery of all while researching this article: the realization that @amysedaris, the foul rag and bone shop of Instagram, the junkyard at the end of the social-media universe, contained a picture I had somehow previously missed, of  me. In among the dirty valentines, feetloaf and hairless cats, there was my own arm, photographed for a project in which Campbell gave mystery tattoos to blind participants through a hole in a wall. (Its a long story.) I was surprised and delighted to see it, but I felt a little queasy, too  the photo itself isnt unflattering, but surrounded by all that Sedaris filter, it was awfully jarring. So I did the only thing you can do: I kept scrolling, looking for something worse."}

{"text": "What is your reaction to this video? Do you think this little girl was humiliated? Have you ever been in the same position? How did it affect you?The video, which was recorded surreptitiously by an assistant teacher in the fall of 2014, was published by The New York Times this month along with a related article about Success Academy, a New York City charter school network.Thousands of readers commented, Success Academy held a defiant news conference, and two of our Student Council members suggested it as a topic for discussion on our blog.Read more below, then consider the questions our Student Council members pose about whether this kind of teaching encourages or discourages learning.In the Feb. 12 article At Success Academy School, a Stumble in Math and a Teachers Anger on Video, Kate Taylor writes: The teacher in the video, Charlotte Dial, works at a Success Academy charter school in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. She has been considered so effective that the network promoted her last year to being a model teacher, who helps train her colleagues.After sending the girl out of the circle and having another child demonstrate how to solve the problem, Ms. Dial again chastises her, saying, Youre confusing everybody. She then proclaims herself very upset and very disappointed.The video was recorded surreptitiously in the fall of 2014 by an assistant teacher who was concerned by what she described as Ms. Dials daily harsh treatment of the children. The assistant teacher, who insisted on anonymity because she feared endangering future job prospects, shared the video with The New York Times after she left Success in November.After being shown the video last month, Ann Powell, a Success spokeswoman, described its contents as shocking and said Ms. Dial had been suspended pending an investigation. But a week and a half later, Ms. Dial returned to her classroom and her role as an exemplar within the network.Successs own training materials, provided by the networks leader, Eva S. Moskowitz, say that teachers should never yell at children, use a sarcastic, frustrated tone, give consequences intended to shame children, or speak to a child in a way they wouldnt in front of the childs parents.Ms. Moskowitz dismissed the video as an anomaly. A group of parents gathered by the Cobble Hill schools principal defended Ms. Dial and said the video did not reflect their experience of the school.But interviews with 20 current and former Success teachers suggest that while Ms. Dials behavior might be extreme, much of it is not uncommon within the network.In a Feb. 25 follow-up article, Mother of Girl Berated in Video Assails Success Academys Response, Ms. Taylor writes:Nadya Miranda thought she had found a safe haven for her daughter: a Success Academy charter school in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where she hoped her daughter would get a good education and be put on a path to college.Then she saw the video. When the video was published by The New York Times this month, Success Academy held a defiant news conference. The networks founder, Eva S. Moskowitz, defended the teacher, Charlotte Dial, saying that she had apologized in real time to her students, and accused The Times of bias. A teacher suggested that the newspaper did not believe that black and Hispanic children could be academically successful. Two parents stood up to say that they did not need The Times to tell them what was happening in their childrens schools.Ms. Miranda, however, tells a different story.In two lengthy interviews, she said that she did not know what was happening in her daughters classroom before she saw the video. She said that she was so upset by what she saw  and by the networks rush to rally around Ms. Dial, while showing little concern for her daughter or other students  that she took the girl out of the school in late January.Ms. Miranda said that while Ms. Dial had apologized to her, the teacher had never apologized to her daughter. She said that a public relations specialist for Success drafted an email for her, asking The Times not to publish the video, and that at a meeting Ms. Moskowitz held at the school on Jan. 20, Ms. Moskowitz asked the parents to support Ms. Dial and to defend the school to the paper. Ms. Miranda said that when she stood up, identified herself and objected that Ms. Moskowitz was asking parents to support the teacher without even showing them the video, Ms. Moskowitz cut her off.Students: Read these articles, then answer the questions below, many of which were posed by the Student Council members Aleena Ismail and Jihyun Youn: What is your reaction to this video? Do you side more with Times commenters who call it child abuse or those who think its no big deal and say we should stop coddling children because its a tough world out there? Why? How far do you want your teachers to push you to succeed academically? What type of encouragement do you think is most effective and appropriate in a classroom setting? Is it possible to hold students to high standards without being aggressive? What do you think is the right balance between authority and support in teacher-student relationships? Do you think societys emphasis on test scores as a demonstration of intelligence and success has affected the way your teachers teach? Is that a bad thing? Does humiliation sometimes motivate students to achieve? Have you ever been humiliated by a teacher? How did you feel? What effect did it have on you? Have you had teachers who motivated you to achieve without scaring or humiliating you? What did they do?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. All comments are moderated by Learning Network staff members, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public."}
{"text": "Diesel is a dirty word these days thanks to the Volkswagen scandal.Thats a shame, because the engine technology offers the kind of performance thats quite appealing, namely serious muscle off the line and significantly improved fuel economy over gasoline-powered engines.Into this hostile environment, Land Rover brings its first diesel for the American market. Do not judge by the misdeeds of others; the Td6 3-liter turbodiesel motor may be the best way to motivate a Range Rover. Diesels stump-pulling power encourages off-roading, perfect when tossing this $103,925 (as tested) luxury vehicle on the Rubicon Trail.Lets address the gaseous elephant in the room: emissions. Like other automakers, Land Rover uses a fluid called urea, which mists the exhaust to knock down emissions, turning harmful nitrogen oxide into plain old nitrogen. The urea tank gets filled every 10,000 miles or so. Theres low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation, too, but then Id be getting all technical on you.The Td6 packs 254 horsepower and enough soul-satisfying torque to drag Lucifer back to Hades, 440 pound-feet to be precise. Five minutes behind the wheel of this rig is the best publicity diesel could have. Only those outside the car might, and I emphasize might, know this is a diesel. The telltale grumble is replaced with a sonic quality closer to gasoline direct-injection. Inside, the Range Rover is whisper quiet even as it cranks from rest to 60 miles an hour in about seven seconds. Fuel economy is officially rated by the government at 22 miles per gallon in the city, 29 on the highway. I averaged 28 in mixed driving, heavy on urban slogging.Power is routed through an 8-speed transmission (its controller knob glides strikingly from the console on start-up). Most will leave Land Rovers Terrain Response four-wheel drive system in auto mode. For severe traversing, dial in the symbol of the terrain you plan to cross (much like sorting socks, only theres always a match). In everyday use, this deftly maneuvers the concrete canyons it will see most. Its no Miata, but its well controlled for the breed.Imagine fording 35 inches of water while cocooned by fine leather and woodwork. In an S-Class Mercedes, that would mean something is terribly wrong. Everything seen and touched inside the Range Rovers cabin has a stout, hefty quality about it, even the floor mats. The Meridian sound system delivers on its lofty sonic promise. I want the carpet in my house.The rear seats dont slide fore and aft to max out leg or cargo room. But if passengers complain about the space, feel free to kick them out. They get their own climate control, seat heaters and a great view of the sky. Cargo room is vast enough to haul furniture to the summer place. The air suspension drops the back for easier loading.Land Rovers have a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty for those concerned about reliability. To be straight-up honest, my practical Midwest upbringing once saw the luxurious appointments of a Range Rover to be a little much. Who pushes a vehicle that begins at $85,945 through knee-deep mud on the way to boulder-strewn paths? I now find the amalgamation of opera house refinement and mountain goat ability perversely appealing.The $1,500 premium for the diesel engine is a wise investment, less for the fuel economy than its driving pleasure. For the wealthy, a Range Rover can be a money saver, combining luxury car and off-roader into one purchase. S.U.V., in this case, stands for supremely upscale vehicle."}

{"text": "For a sector rooted in change, fashion has often proved surprisingly resistant to rewrite.Consider, for example, one beloved refrain of the last decade in boardrooms and backrooms alike: that Milan was the least creative of the four fashion capitals, run by old names, dominated by big money and lacking any support from a crumbling establishment. By contrast, London was considered a breeding ground of edgy young things lauded as faces of the future, and Paris, all creative conceptualism and glamour, the zenith of the seasonal calendar. Pity the poor young Italian designer, struggling to break through.It may be time to rethink the stereotype. Among the 50 Italian names on the Milanese calendar, a constellation of rising stars has emerged over the last five years.By comparison, the Parisian calendar is dominated by international designers (from Belgium, Britain, the United States, Japan and, with the arrival of Demna Gvasalia at Balenciaga, Georgia). And though a clutch of new French names has emerged in recent seasons, including Guillaume Henry at Nina Ricci, Julien Dossena at Paco Rabanne, and Sbastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant at Courrges, it is in Milan that a next generation of creativity seems to have reached critical mass.Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Rodolfo Paglialunga at Jil Sander and Alessandra Facchinetti at Tods have all successfully taken the reins at top-tier Milanese houses, as has Massimiliano Giornetti at Salvatore Ferragamo. Meanwhile fledgling talents including Marco de Vincenzo, Fausto Puglisi, Massimo Giorgetti (of MSGM and Pucci) and Stella Jean are attracting considerable attention  and acclaim. Two years ago, Alberta Ferretti handed over the reins of her Philosophy line to Lorenzo Serafini.Government funding, coupled with Vogue Italia-driven initiatives such as Who Is On Next, competitions that nurture and showcase the countrys young blood, have helped spark what may be seen as a 21st-century fashion renaissance in Italy.Things are changing fast, and the issues of the past are now behind us. We are really focused on getting our brands of tomorrow into the spotlight today, said Carlo Capasa, president of the Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana, the industry organization that is spearheading expansion by helping designers with funding, show spaces and contacts.I honestly believe that Italy today is a great place for a young designer to be, he added. We have the heritage, the manufacturing base, and are working harder than ever to educate emerging talent and absorb them into the ecosystem.One factor behind this shift in attitude centers on the recognition of the essential role played by the fashion sector in kick-starting the stagnating Italian economy. Total revenue generated by the Italian fashion industry was more than 61 billion euros, or nearly $68 billion, in 2014. Once the final figures for 2015 are totaled, analysts estimate revenue will have risen 7 percent last year, to 65 billion.Put another way: Italians dont have a choice. Fostering the future of Italian fashion will be key to surviving the present rocky macroeconomic climate. So it is no coincidence that Milan Fashion Week will be opened with a lunch hosted, for the first time, by an Italian prime minister. (In this case, Matteo Renzi.)Historically, Italy has just not been a place ready for new things. It never has been, said Marco de Vincenzo, 38, who spent 13 years at Fendi before winning the Who Is On Next? competition and gaining investment for his brand from LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2014. It has always been enamored with the glory of its past  and not just within the confines of fashion.Up until five years ago, the politics around fashion week were next to impossible. There was little way of getting on the calendar, suggesting new ideas or finding investment, he continued. And there had been an unintentional creative devolution, from an Italian design DNA towards trends that emanated from elsewhere, which made the scene feel stale. We didnt really know who we were anymore.Mr. Paglialunga, at Jil Sander, added that many major design schools were abroad, and that risk-averse small factories and wholesalers in Italy were reluctant to play their part in educating fledgling designers on how to run businesses at home.They refused to look beyond their bottom lines, take a chance or spend time on those who needed it, he said by telephone this month. And many small businesses could fail as a result if they couldnt deliver on orders or learn about how the system worked.It was only when the financial crisis hit that they were forced to accommodate those they had refused to consider previously. And that is finally starting to pay dividends now, Mr. Paglialunga said. Not least because we Italians are at a huge advantage as designers by being so close to so many quality manufacturing bases. Young brands can learn faster and better now they have more exposure.Other designers, like Stella Jean, suggested that the financial and constructive support that media and brand powerhouses began providing several years ago has flowed into the quality of the designs on Milans runways. Now, there is an ongoing dialog now between the giants and the baby brands like mine, Ms. Jean said.Ms. Jean, a 37-year-old Haitian-Italian who is based in Rome and known for her bold and bright design sensibility, got her big break in 2013, when Giorgio Armani lent his Armani Teatro space to her during Milan Fashion Week to show a collection to international buyers and media.The dialog with established houses, she said, is allowing us to construct our own stories, very far from the mainstream. To have that balance on our calendar now, especially at a time when the luxury consumer is looking more and more for unique and individualistic approaches to style, is like our second renaissance.Some have suggested that the figures who went further afield and eventually reinvigorated big-name fashion houses elsewhere  think Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy, or Stefano Pilati, who was creative director at Yves Saint Laurent from 2004 to 2012  paved the way for those designers who remained at home.Mr. Puglisi, a Sicilian who left for the United States at 22 and got an early break designing costumes for Whitney Houston before assisting the fashion photographer David LaChapelle, said: From Marco Polo onwards, Italian dreamers have fantasized about escape, to places that believe in the power of youth and exoticism and where a fortune can be won. It is built into our mind-set.Discovered by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana in 2010, Mr. Puglisi was involved in the Spiga 2 project, a concept store in Milan founded by Mssrs. Dolce and Gabbana to showcase the work of young designers. He became creative director of Emanuel Ungaro in 2012 and started showcasing his own labels catwalk collection in 2013.Going beyond our own borders to understand the size of the global consumer market is an important chapter for many people before they eventually returned home, he said. It certainly was for me and my business.Mr. Puglisi also pointed out that most in the so-called new generation of designers are at least 35. Hardly young in most peoples books, he said, but considerably more so than Mr. Armani and Mrs. Prada I suppose."}
{"text": "Nadya Miranda thought she had found a safe haven for her daughter: a Success Academy charter school in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where she hoped her daughter would get a good education and be put on a path to college.Then she saw the video.The video, which was recorded surreptitiously by an assistant teacher in the fall of 2014, captured a first-grade teacher at the school scolding Ms. Mirandas daughter for being unable to explain to the class how she solved a math problem. The teacher ripped the girls paper in half, ordered her to leave the circle to sit in what she called the calm-down chair, and said that she was angry and disappointed.When the video was published by The New York Times this month, Success Academy held a defiant news conference. The networks founder, Eva S. Moskowitz, defended the teacher, Charlotte Dial, saying that she had apologized in real time to her students, and accused The Times of bias. A teacher suggested that the newspaper did not believe that black and Hispanic children could be academically successful. Two parents stood up to say that they did not need The Times to tell them what was happening in their childrens schools.Ms. Miranda, however, tells a different story.In two lengthy interviews, she said that she did not know what was happening in her daughters classroom before she saw the video. She said that she was so upset by what she saw  and by the networks rush to rally around Ms. Dial, while showing little concern for her daughter or other students  that she took the girl out of the school in late January.Ms. Miranda said that while Ms. Dial had apologized to her, the teacher had never apologized to her daughter. She said that a public relations specialist for Success drafted an email for her, asking The Times not to publish the video, and that at a meeting Ms. Moskowitz held at the school on Jan. 20, Ms. Moskowitz asked the parents to support Ms. Dial and to defend the school to the paper. Ms. Miranda said that when she stood up, identified herself and objected that Ms. Moskowitz was asking parents to support the teacher without even showing them the video, Ms. Moskowitz cut her off.Shes like, You had enough to say, you had enough to say, and she tried to talk over me, Ms. Miranda said. So I just really got frustrated, and I just walked out, and the parents that were concerned followed me, and the parents who were against me and for the teacher stayed in the auditorium.Ms. Miranda took her daughter home that morning and did not bring her back to the school. The next week, after confirming that there was a seat in the regular public school where her younger son is in prekindergarten, she withdrew her daughter and placed her in that school.Success Academy declined to comment on the specifics of Ms. Mirandas account, though in an emailed statement, Stefan Friedman, a spokesman, said the network was sorry Ms. Miranda chose to withdraw her daughter.Ms. Dial did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Miranda, 23, said she sent her daughter to Success Academy because she wanted her to get a better education than she had and to aspire to college. Ms. Miranda was raised mostly by her mother, who spoke only Spanish and was disabled by diabetes and heart disease by the time Ms. Miranda was 13. She became pregnant in ninth grade and dropped out of school, later earning her high school equivalency diploma. She has worked as a home health aide and earns money now by babysitting for friends children. She and her children are currently living in a family shelter.Her daughter attended Public School 10, the Magnet School of Math, Science and Design Technology in Brooklyn, for kindergarten, but Ms. Miranda was unimpressed with the work.I felt that she was doing more drawing than actually learning, she said.She entered the lottery for Success Academy, drawn by the networks reputation for academic rigor, and won a seat. But when the school gave her daughter a placement test, administrators said she had to repeat kindergarten.Her daughter was placed in Ms. Dials class for kindergarten and then stayed with the teacher for first grade. Ms. Miranda said her daughter had done well in math, but struggled with reading and writing and, over time, became discouraged.She used to tell me: Im never going to get it. I just dont know. Im not as smart as the other kids, Ms. Miranda said. I would hear that from her, and Id be like, Where are you getting this from?When she saw the video, Ms. Miranda said, she understood her daughters dejection.It makes me feel bad as a parent  like, what am I going to do to build her confidence all over again? she said.In an interview and at the news conference, Ms. Moskowitz dismissed the video as an anomaly, but Ms. Mirandas daughter, now 8, said that Ms. Dial frequently yelled at students for infractions like not folding their hands. She said that she did not remember the specific incident captured on the video, but that she was afraid to ask questions in Ms. Dials class, because asking Ms. Dial to explain something a second time would lead to a punishment. She said Ms. Dial had on other occasions ripped up childrens papers when she thought they were copying others work.She said she did not complain to her mother, because I was scared of Ms. Dial.Ms. Miranda said she learned about the video when she arrived to pick her daughter up from school on Jan. 13 and was told to get her from the principals office. The principal, Kerri Nicholls, told Ms. Miranda that The Times was asking about a video of an incident between her daughter and Ms. Dial, but that she did not know what it showed. The next day, at a meeting with Ms. Nicholls, Ms. Dial and Ann Powell, the networks executive vice president for public affairs, Ms. Miranda watched the video. She said that Ms. Dial cried and apologized to her, saying that she had had a bad day.But Ms. Miranda said that an apology coming more than a year after the incident did not feel genuine.Upset after viewing the video, Ms. Miranda said she did not want it published, to protect her daughters privacy. Ms. Powell suggested she send an email to The Times. When Ms. Miranda said she did not know what to write, Ms. Powell drafted the email for her and told her to send it from her email address because it would be more powerful coming from her.On Jan. 20, after the schoolwide meeting with the parents, Ms. Miranda sent another email to The Times saying that she was not happy with how the school was handling the incident and asking to be contacted. She did not speak with a reporter until last week.Ms. Miranda said Ms. Moskowitz did not try to contact her until after the meeting on the 20th, and at that point, she felt it was too late. What most distressed her, Ms. Miranda said, was that the network and even many of the parents united behind Ms. Dial and did not seem to care about how her behavior affected children.After the video became public, Ms. Moskowitz sent an email to parents at the networks schools asking for your compassion and understanding in judging this video and Ms. Dial.Despite having publicly described the incident captured on video as an isolated one, Ms. Moskowitz said in her email to parents that the network was taking steps to ensure this does not happen again. Ms. Moskowitz said those steps included retraining teachers on our approach and the importance of setting high expectations and demanding that scholars give their best effort, but always in the context of deeply respecting children, and refining our introductory training to include more sessions on self-awareness, stress management, and the ability to manage up and ask for the help. She said that from now on Success would provide training on those issues three times a year.Seeking to hold someone accountable for what happened to her daughter, Ms. Miranda went into a Department of Education building in Brooklyn to ask about filing a complaint, but was told that Success was independent from the school district. She said that Ms. Nicholls, the principal, had given her information about how to reach Successs board of trustees, and that she had sent a letter, but she was not optimistic that she would get a response.Ms. Miranda said she felt betrayed by the school that she had hoped would give her daughter a better life.I trust you guys with my daughter, and now I feel like I cant trust you, she said."}
{"text": "Everybody does it, is an excuse expected from a mischievous child, not a presidential candidate. But that is Hillary Clintons latest defense for making closed-door, richly paid speeches to big banks, which many middle-class Americans still blame for their economic pain, and then refusing to release the transcripts.A televised town hall on Tuesday was at least the fourth candidate forum in which Mrs. Clinton was asked about those speeches. Again, she gave a terrible answer, saying that she would release transcripts if everybody does it, and that includes the Republicans.In November, she implied that her paid talks for the Wall Street firms were part of helping them rebuild after the 9/11 attacks, which was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists.In a debate with Bernie Sanders on Feb. 4, Mrs. Clinton was asked if she would release transcripts, and she said she would look into it. Later in February, asked in a CNN town hall forum why she accepted $675,000 for speeches to Goldman Sachs, she got annoyed, shrugged, and said, Thats what they offered, adding that every secretary of state that I know has done that.At another  town hall, on Feb. 18, a man in the audience pleaded, Please, just release those transcripts so that we know exactly where you stand. Mrs. Clinton had told him, I am happy to release anything I have when everybody else does the same, because every other candidate in this race has given speeches to private groups.On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton further complained, Why is there one standard for me, and not for everybody else?The only different standard here is the one Mrs. Clinton set for herself, by personally earning $11 million in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 for 51 speeches to banks and other groups and industries.Voters have every right to know what Mrs. Clinton told these groups. In July, her spokesman Nick Merrill said that though most speeches were private, the Clinton operation always opened speeches when asked to. Transcripts of speeches that have been leaked have been pretty innocuous. By refusing to release them all, especially the bank speeches, Mrs. Clinton fuels speculation about why shes stonewalling.Her conditioning her releases on what the Republicans might or might not do is mystifying. Republicans make no bones about their commitment to Wall Street deregulation and tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Mrs. Clinton is laboring to convince struggling Americans that she will rein in big banks, despite taking their money.Besides, Mrs. Clinton is not running against a Republican in the Democratic primaries. She is running against Bernie Sanders, a decades-long critic of Wall Street excess who is hardly a hot ticket on the industry speaking circuit. The Sanders campaign, asked if Mr. Sanders also received fees for closed-door speeches, came up with two from two decades ago that were not transcribed: one to a hospital trade association, and one to a college, each for less than $1,000. Royalties from a book called The Speech, Mr. Sanderss eight-hour Senate floor diatribe against President Obamas continuation of Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, were donated to the nonprofit Addison County Parent/Child Center in Vermont.The hazards of Mrs. Clinton, a presidential hopeful, earning more than $200,000 each for dozens of speeches to industry groups were clear from the start. Mrs. Clinton was making paid speeches when she hired consultants to vet her own background in preparation for a run. If they didnt flag this, they werent doing their jobs.Public interest in these speeches is legitimate, and it is the public  not the candidate  who decides how much disclosure is enough. By stonewalling on these transcripts Mrs. Clinton plays into the hands of those who say shes not trustworthy and makes her own rules. Most important, she is damaging her credibility among Democrats who are begging her to show them that shed run an accountable and transparent White House."}
{"text": "Surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic have performed the first uterus transplant in the United States, the clinic announced Thursday.The operation, which took nine hours, was performed Wednesday, using a uterus from a deceased organ donor.The recipient, 26, is not being identified to protect her privacy. A statement from the clinic said that she was in stable condition Thursday afternoon.The procedures purpose is to enable women born without a uterus, or who had theirs removed, to become pregnant and give birth. The patient will have to wait a year before trying to become pregnant, letting her heal and giving doctors time to adjust the doses of medication she needs to prevent organ rejection.Then she will need in vitro fertilization to become pregnant. Before the transplant, the patient had eggs removed surgically, fertilized with her husbands sperm and frozen. The embryos will be transferred into her uterus.The transplant will be temporary: The uterus will be removed after the recipient has had one or two babies, so she can stop taking anti-rejection drugs.The Cleveland hospitals ethics panel has given it permission to perform the procedure 10 times, as an experiment. Officials will then decide whether to continue, and whether to offer the operation as a standard procedure. The clinic is still screening women who may be candidates for the operation.The leader of the surgical team is Dr. Andreas G. Tzakis, who has performed 4,000 to 5,000 transplants of kidneys, livers and other abdominal organs. To prepare for uterus transplants, he traveled to Sweden and worked with doctors at the University of Gothenburg, the only ones in the world to have performed the procedure successfully so far. Nine women have had the operation in Sweden, with the transplants taken from living donors. At least four recipients have had babies, who were born healthy though premature.About 50,000 women in the United States are thought to be candidates for transplanted uteruses.In an interview in October, Dr. Tzakis said that although women without a uterus could adopt children or hire surrogates to carry a pregnancy for them, many find those options unacceptable for reasons that are personal, cultural or religious.At that time, a 26-year-old woman who was being screened as a potential candidate explained why she wanted a chance to become pregnant and give birth.I crave that experience, she said. I want the morning sickness, the backaches, the feet swelling. I want to feel the baby move. That is something Ive wanted for as long as I can remember."}
{"text": "TAMPA, Fla.  A year ago, Alex Rodriguez showed up here unannounced to even the Yankees, his first news conference an impromptu event on the sidewalk outside their minor league complex and his first steps back into baseball from a yearlong drug suspension awkward and uncertain.So when he sat at a table Thursday afternoon and addressed the news media after being showered with adoration by fans at his first workout at Steinbrenner Field, it was hard not to notice the difference  especially for him.Its certainly liberating coming into this season not carrying all this luggage with me all off-season, Rodriguez said. Im at ease. Im in a good place.Gone are the questions about whether Yankees management, with whom he had bitterly feuded, wanted him around. Or whether, after a years absence, he could still earn a place on the roster, let alone be the lineups anchor. Or whether he might be vilified, even by Yankee fans. (Everyone elses fans were pretty much a given.) The uncertainty has been replaced with something approaching acceptance.A revived bat and a remorseful veneer allowed Rodriguez to experience what he called in many ways a Cinderella season.As the Yankees approach this season, they may need another fairy-tale one from Rodriguez, who belted 33 home runs  his most since 2008  and strayed from controversy, while drawing in his teammates with his knowledge of the game and his self-deprecating humor.Although he is 40, Rodriguez, who has two years and $42 million remaining on his contract, is the Yankees lone fearsome right-handed bat, one that is important enough that the Yankees will not ask Rodriguez  long ago a Gold Glove shortstop and third baseman  to play in the field for fear of injury. The two gloves in his locker are only for ornamentation.Its best that we dont put him out there, Manager Joe Girardi said. Physically, just to keep him healthy, its better to leave him at D.H.Girardi jokingly said he did not know why Rodriguez picked up a glove and took it out toward second base after he was finished taking his cuts in batting practice. Im not sure it was his, though, Girardi said.Girardi, of course, was not the only one who noticed. Cameras and reporters tracked Rodriguezs first day on the field  he stretched in the dugout, sat and waited for his group to hit, hugged the shortstop prospect Jorge Mateo and bunted the first two pitches before driving many of the ensuing ones deep around the field.After each round, he was met with cheers and encouragement.When Rodriguez was finished doing his runs from home to first, he walked beyond the first-base dugout to sign autographs as a couple hundred fans raced over in the hope of getting one. If similar exercises were hesitant a year ago, he was loose and engaged, offering a toddler a high-five when his mother said his name was Alex.There was little attention paid to anyone else.I was kind of giggling today, Girardi said. He was standing at second base, and there were like 12 people taking pictures of him with his glove. Alex has always been a guy thats been worthy of attention, and I dont think its ever going to change.Not this season, anyway. With 687 home runs, Rodriguez is within reach of Babe Ruths 714, as well as 700. And the Yankees have planned May 14 as Alex Rodriguez Bat Day, an event that he said was unimaginable last year when he tussled with the Yankees over the first in a series of $6 million marketing bonuses tied to his milestone home runs.When it came to expectations for him this season, Rodriguez gave a wide berth to the subject, saying he has never projected numbers. His goal is simply to help the Yankees win. But he also knows to do that he will have to perform better than he did in August and September, when his decline mirrored that of the Yankees, who watched the Toronto Blue Jays charge past them for the division title. Rodriguez batted .191 from Aug. 1 until the end of the season.I kind of went back and studied the season a little bit, Rodriguez said. I ran out of gas in August. My energy kind of picked up again in September; I just stunk. Ill pace myself a little more.Rodriguez will also have the opportunity to burnish his role as a sage elder. He provided a comforting voice for shortstop Didi Gregorius when he struggled in Derek Jeters shadow early in the season before blossoming late and received rave reviews as a television analyst during the playoffs. And he might be the one person on the team who understands what reliever Aroldis Chapman is going through as he awaits a possible suspension by Major League Baseball, which is investigating Chapmans involvement in a domestic violence case.Rodriguez said he would advise Chapman to focus on his job and build relationships with his teammates, and he noted that anytime any of us run into a challenging situation, it gives you an opportunity to look in the mirror and make some changes.Changes have taken Rodriguez far in the last year. So far that the man who was not long ago the scourge of baseball was prodded about the prospect of one day leading a team.Ill be managing probably my girls team, or volunteering at the Boys and Girls Club, Rodriguez said. But I wont be managing. You can quote me on that one.INSIDE PITCHAroldis Chapman was excused from practice Thursday for a matter relating to his citizenship application, according to a person familiar with the situation. ... Left fielder Brett Gardner was restricted to 50 swings off a tee and soft toss as a result of a bone bruise on his left wrist, an injury lingering from the teams wild-card playoff loss."}
{"text": "DUBLIN   Sean Crowe, a member of the Irish Parliament, has been around long enough to remember just how tough it was to attract votes when his party, Sinn Fein, was known only as the political arm of the Irish Republican Army as it waged a guerrilla campaign against Britain in Northern Ireland, only an hours drive from his Dublin constituency.Yet after decades in which Sinn Fein was defined almost exclusively by its place in the often-violent conflict over reuniting Ireland, it appears to be on the cusp of rebranding itself as a more mainstream party in Ireland  and even to emerge as one of the primary voices of the left-leaning opposition.Sinn Fein continues to be led by Gerry Adams, 67, who has been the partys president since 1983 and has always been closely linked to the I.R.A. even though he has long denied being a member. Mr. Adams, who won a seat in the Irish Parliament in 2011, has sought to recast the party as one opposed to the austerity policies that have dominated Irish life since the financial crisis of 2009, and as a populist alternative to the dominant parties of the center right and center left.Polls suggest Sinn Fein has a chance in Fridays election of gaining enough seats in Parliament to become one of the countrys three biggest parties, along with Fine Gael, the center-right party that leads the current coalition government, and Fianna Fail, another center-right party.During the conflict there was a lot of negativity and abuse when I used to knock on doors, but now we are regarded as a serious alternative to the right-wing establishment parties who have governed this state over the years, Mr. Crowe said. People no longer see us as being at the extremes of the debate; they take us seriously on issues such as health care, housing, education and taxation.The I.R.A.s armed campaign in Northern Ireland and Britain long held back political support for Sinn Fein in Ireland. Against a backdrop of bombs, assassinations and riots, in 1987 Sinn Fein attracted less than 2 percent of the vote in Irish elections.But by late last year, polls showed Sinn Fein running neck-and-neck with the largest of the governing parties. Although the latest polling suggests Sinn Fein is heading into the election with somewhat lower levels of popular support, it remains strong enough that analysts give it a good chance of increasing the number of seats it holds in the 158-member Parliament into the mid-20s from 14.Though the vote takes place shortly before the centenary commemorations of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule, Sinn Fein has campaigned on more contemporary concerns like hospital waiting lists, rising homelessness and the introduction of water charges, which has become a rallying cry against austerity measures.Three weeks ago, when the date for the election was announced, the smart money was on the Fine Gael-led government coalition returning to power on the back of economic recovery, falling unemployment  and the lack of a credible alternative.Yet polls have consistently showed voters willing to back left-leaning parties and independent candidates. Sinn Feins opportunity comes at a time when populist, left-leaning movements have won converts in many European nations that embraced austerity. Yet David Farrell, a professor of politics at University College Dublin, said it would be a mistake to lump Sinn Fein in with newer left-leaning, anti-austerity parties like Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece.They may be cut from the same cloth politically, but Sinn Fein is not some new political force; rather it is a long-established party with all of the baggage that goes with it, he said.Like many observers, Professor Farrell said he believed that Sinn Fein was playing the long game, content to develop a power base, over decades if necessary, rather than enter a coalition government as a junior partner forced to compromise for the sake of power. He also believes that maturation may dull its radical edge.This time around I believe they have far too high a hill to climb, but they are still going to have a great election, he said. But it wouldnt surprise me that by the time they are ready for government, Sinn Fein will have morphed into a more centrist party.The ending of the I.R.A. campaign in Northern Ireland has certainly given the party a more mainstream appeal. Many of its senior personnel are bright, articulate and youthful enough to allow voters to forget events before the 1998 Belfast Agreement that heralded peace in Northern Ireland.Yet Mr. Adams, who swapped his West Belfast political stronghold to win a seat south of the border in County Louth in the last election, has again been a lightning rod. He has never seemed comfortable arguing his partys case on economic grounds, and time and again during debates his opponents concentrated on his association with events in Northern Ireland during the conflict rather than his role in ending it.This has extended to other senior members of his party who are also being dragged into the past.In one confrontation, the departing minister for health, Leo Varadkar, asked Sinn Feins deputy leader, Mary-Lou McDonald, on NewsTalk, a national radio station, on Wednesday, Wheres my partys legacy of people who were murdered or people who lost their mother, or bodies buried in bogs  or people who are still living today who are maimed, who still carry the scars and burns?To hear Sinn Fein claiming credit for peace because they stopped killing people it is just unbelievable, he said."}
{"text": "Tony Burton, who played a tough-talking boxing trainer in six of the Rocky movies with Sylvester Stallone, died on Thursday in a California hospital, his family said. He was 78.The cause was complications of pneumonia, Aurelian Burton, his wife of 36 years, said.She said that her husband had been in and out of the hospital recently with various ailments. Mr. Burtons daughter, Juanita, said he was suffering from dementia.In the Rocky franchise, Mr. Burton portrayed Duke, the hard-as-nails trainer of the boxer Apollo Creed, Rockys initial nemesis and eventual best friend. He later trained Rocky himself.Carl Weathers, the actor who played Apollo Creed, eulogized Mr. Burton on Twitter on Friday, saying that his intensity and talent helped make the Rocky movies successful.Because of his poor health, Mr. Burton was unable to participate in the latest installment of the movie series, Creed, which was released in 2015 and focuses on Rockys role as trainer and mentor to the son of Apollo Creed. But Loretta Kelley, his sister, said that Mr. Burtons picture is visible on a restaurant wall in one scene.Anthony Mabron Burton was born in Flint, Mich., on March 23, 1937.Ms. Kelley said she and others who were close to him called him by his middle name. He played football and baseball at Flint Northern High School and graduated in 1955.Mr. Burton started boxing as an amateur with the Golden Gloves organization, where he excelled. He won two Flint Golden Gloves light-heavyweight titles, in 1955 and 1957, then briefly fought professionally  in the light-heavyweight division from 1958 to 1959 before retiring from the ring after a beloved coach died.He moved to Los Angeles, but drifted and later got in trouble with the law, eventually serving a three-year prison sentence for robbery. While in prison, he became interested in acting and took a vocational training course in radio and television repair.It took a while, but your life prepares you for these roles, Mr. Burton said in an interview with The Daily Breeze, a Torrance, Calif., newspaper, in 1988. If I hadnt been a fighter, I probably wouldnt have gotten the Rocky roles. If I hadnt been in prison, maybe I wouldnt have gotten all those prison roles.Juanita Burton, said that her father met his current wife, Aurelian, when he was on the job repairing televisions while seeking regular acting work.His acting credits also include roles in Stir Crazy and a variety of television shows.Mr. Burton, who lived in Sun City, Calif., is survived by his wife, four brothers, four sisters, a daughter, a stepdaughter and a son. Another son, Martin, died in 2014.He was an ordained deacon at the Mount Hebron Baptist Church in South Central Los Angeles.In the Rocky movies, Mr. Burtons character, Tony (Duke) Evers, was known for his tough-talking  motivational speeches to his fighters. On Twitter on Friday, fans shared favorites.Now, you are going to have to go through hell, worse than any nightmare that you ever dreamed, Duke tells Rocky in one speech, his voice barely above a whisper, before a match in Rocky IV. But in the end, I know you will be the one standing."}
{"text": "DUBLIN  A man regarded as a former leader of the Irish Republican Army and a top ally of the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, was sentenced on Friday by a three-judge panel in Dublin to 18 months in prison for tax evasion.The no-jury Special Criminal Court heard during a 32-day trial that a raid on the farm belonging to the man, Thomas Murphy, 66, in 2006 had uncovered the equivalent of $4 million in cash and $6 million in uncashed checks, computers with coded account details and several ledgers hidden among hay bales in a cattle shed.The man, also known as Slab Murphy, had no previous convictions, but he was once named by the London newspaper The Sunday Times as a senior I.R.A. figure responsible for directing a bombing campaign in England (he lost a 1 million pound, or $1.4 million, libel case against the newspaper in 1998).The sentencing coincided with voting in parliamentary elections in Ireland, and opinion polls before the balloting suggested that Sinn Fein would increase its representation and could even become the main opposition party.Party insiders worried that the timing of the sentencing could damage their election prospects. During the three-week campaign, news outlets and Sinn Feins political opponents have been critical of Mr. Adamss defense of Mr. Murphy and of his call to abolish the Special Criminal Court.Mr. Adams described Mr. Murphy after his conviction in December as a good republican who had been instrumental in ensuring the continuation of the peace process in Northern Ireland. He also called for the abolition of the Special Criminal Court, calling it draconian.The court deals primarily with issues related to terrorism and serious organized crime, but its remit can be extended, particularly when there are concerns about the potential for jury intimidation.Sentencing was initially scheduled for two weeks ago, but the judges said they required more time and postponed their decision until Friday.Mr. Murphys farm straddles the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, with access to both jurisdictions. The court was told that he owed a total of 190,000 euros, or about $210,000, to the Irish tax authorities for undeclared income from the sale of cattle and property from 1996 to 2004.The evidence came from a cross-border operation in 2006 involving 400 customs officers, police officers and soldiers who conducted the raid on the farm. An accountant employed by the Criminal Assets Bureau in Ireland, which prosecuted Mr. Murphy on behalf of the state, said that some of the ledgers that had been seized contained information about transactions that were never declared for tax purposes.Mr. Murphy denied the charges against him, but the court rejected his defense that his brother Patrick was responsible for the farms financial affairs and his testimony that his signature had been forged on documents related to the farm and its income.In a statement issued through his lawyer after the sentencing, Mr. Murphy said he was innocent and would appeal.I am an Irish Republican and have been all my life, he said. For many years now, I have been the subject of serial, prejudicial and wholly inaccurate commentary and media coverage. There have also been repeated assertions that I have amassed properties and wealth. This is utterly untrue. I do not own any property at all, and I have no savings."}
{"text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.  As Matt Harvey threw a routine bullpen session this week, Zack Wheeler stood 10 feet behind him, holding a clipboard. With each pitch Harvey threw, Wheeler marked a box on a sheet of paper, indicating where it was. Coaches typically fill out the form, but Wheeler figured that if he was just standing around, why not help?The Mets staff is being described as arguably the best in baseball. Every time a pitcher throws, he draws a crowd. The Mets gush about their five young, hard-throwing starters: Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz  the heroes of the 2015 postseason  but the fifth one often is not named.Wheeler, who continues to recover from Tommy John surgery, is not expected to rejoin the rotation until around July 1. That leaves him in an uncomfortable situation: trying to be patient with his rehab while teammates and friends prepare for the start of the season without him.I think this is very tough on Zack, said Dan Warthen, the Mets pitching coach. I mean, very tough. Hes watching all these guys who hes just as good as, and he sees theyre getting quite a bit of press. He sees the team is winning  we went to the World Series  and he wasnt part of that. I think thats motivation for him, and Im sure somewhere deep down, it hurts.In the past, a pitcher who had undergone Tommy John surgery might have been on the mound a year later. If that were the timetable for Wheeler, he might be ramping up for the 2016 season now. But because the Mets waited nearly 18 months before letting Harvey return from his own Tommy John surgery, and because Harvey went on to have a very solid 2015 season, the Mets also want Wheeler to stretch out his rehabilitation. If he rejoins the Mets in July, he will have had 15 months to recover.When Wheeler first started to rehabilitate, he signed a one-year lease on a place in Port St. Lucie. Other than a two-month winter break, he has been here, working his way back, one monotonous day after another. To pass the time, he brought his black Labrador, Cabela, from home, played friends in Call of Duty online and tried every good restaurant in the vicinity.At the trade deadline, when Wheeler saw his name included in the failed trade for Carlos Gomez, he called General Manager Sandy Alderson, asking not to be traded at the deadline, and then watched the playoffs from his couch, texting support to his teammates.As camp began and Wheelers teammates trickled in, each told reporters how he had spent his winter. Harvey had been on several talk shows, Syndergaard had shot an Under Armour commercial, and deGroms face had been in an advertisement for baseball caps. Wheeler spent his session being grilled about his recovery process.You see all these guys coming back from it doing well, he said. Youve just got to trust it.The only comforting thing, perhaps, about the experience was that Wheeler had teammates who were recovering from Tommy John surgery or had done so in the past.Josh Edgin had the surgery around the same time and rehabbed in Port St. Lucie with Wheeler.Jeff Walters lived with Wheeler for about two months while finishing his own Tommy John rehabilitation. Wheeler often quizzed Walters on how he felt at certain stages of the process.Wheeler also sought advice from Harvey, deGrom and Matz, who have had the surgery, too. DeGrom told Wheeler that during his recovery, he changed his mechanics to lift his elbow sooner during his delivery to take stress off his elbow and, as a bonus, get his hand on top of the ball more.Wheeler tried it and has already noticed that it helps his command. Just watching Wheeler play catch, Warthen could notice the difference.Alderson also indicated that he was excited to see Wheeler pitch without pain. Wheeler has compiled a 3.50 E.R.A. in 49 starts as a Met, but he said he had felt pain in his elbow for a good few years, which is why the Mets are going to great lengths to ensure that his elbow is sturdy. And so he waits.On Friday, during the first official full-team workout, Wheeler stood by and watched, with a water bottle in his back pocket, as his teammates practiced pickoff throws to second base. Only when the pitchers practiced sacrifice bunts could he participate.Saturday, though, was expected to be a momentous day for Wheeler. He was scheduled to throw off a mound for the first time, about 10 to 15 pitches, a milestone akin to a racehorse rounding into the stretch. Afterward, he would mix in breaking pitches and, eventually, face batters.When Harvey threw his first bullpen session last spring, cameras followed his every move. His Grapefruit League starts became mini-events, and he was scheduled to be ready for Opening Day. For a team coming off six consecutive losing seasons, he offered hope.A year later, Manager Terry Collins watched Harvey throw live batting practice on Friday and gushed about the tighter spin on his slider, that last giddy-up on his fastball, and how much Harvey had improved entering his second season after Tommy John surgery. You could hear the excitement in Collinss voice about what that would mean for the Mets chances this year.Would Collins watch Wheelers session on Saturday, too?Hes a ways away, Collins said, so Im not going to get too amped up yet."}

President Obama on Friday used a visit to a high-technology battery plant in Florida to argue that the hundreds of billions of dollars in federal subsidies he signed into law during his first days in office had bolstered the economy, transformed the nations energy sector, and positioned the United States for a strong rebound.But Mr. Obamas trip to the Saft America factory here, opened in 2011 with a $95.5 million investment from the Department of Energy, also highlighted the challenges that have tempered the economic recovery and the difficulty that the president has had in claiming credit for it.Saft is telling a story about the amazing work that people all across this country have done to bring America back from one of the worst financial crises of our history, Mr. Obama said in a warehouse at the lithium-ion battery plant, built with the help of a grant program in the presidents $787 billion economic stimulus measure.After touring the facility and watching a large robot named Wall-E assembling one of the batteries, the president called the factory tangible evidence that his stimulus package had worked and said that the economy was better off for it. We took an empty swamp and turned it into an engine of innovation, he said.That engine, though, has sputtered as it has struggled to start here. Saft, based in Paris, announced last week that it was reducing the factorys value because it had still not gained profitability in the competitive lithium-ion battery market. Saying he was frustrated, the companys chief executive projected the plant might not be profitable for a few more years.This month marks the seventh anniversary of the laws enactment, and Mr. Obama is using the occasion to burnish his legacy, arguing that it was only because of his swift efforts to pump federal money into the economy when he took office in 2009  and over near-unanimous Republican opposition  that the country recovered from the depths of a painful recession.At the time there were a bunch of folks who said, Well, its not working, its not happening, because it didnt happen overnight, Mr. Obama said. This is an example of the fruits of those investments.Saft stands as a counterpoint to Republicans scathing criticism of the green-energy portion of the stimulus law. Mr. Obamas critics seized on Solyndra, a California solar equipment company that went bankrupt after receiving $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees through the program, as proof that the law was wasteful and poorly overseen.The presidents critics threw a lot of dust in the air about the program, said Dan Utech, a senior energy and climate adviser to Mr. Obama. The dust has settled, and the results are clear  they were transformational.Saft estimated in 2011 that it would create 280 jobs and produce 370 megawatt hours annually of battery power, in line with the presidents drive to invest in renewable energy. Mr. Obama said on Friday that the company had surpassed that goal, creating nearly 300 jobs.Still, the White House concedes that the economic resurgence during Mr. Obamas tenure has done little to raise wages or erase the yawning income inequality gap. A study released on Thursday showed that the gap between Americas richest and poorest communities had widened since the president took office.Mr. Obama addressed the disaffection many Americans still feel about the economy despite obvious indicators of a rebound, including an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, half of what it was when he took office. He said the rapid pace of innovation and the increasingly global economy have stoked anxiety and an impulse to turn inward.Things are changing fast, and thats scary sometimes, the president said. It means that youve got to constantly retrain for the jobs of the future.Mr. Obamas factory tour underscored the point. Much of the work he witnessed was automated, including a large yellow robotic arm that transferred cells to a tray and two robotic carts, Wall-E and another named Eve, that transported the trays to another part of the plant.Sometimes its disorienting, Mr. Obama added, but theres so much possibility."}

Organizers expect as many as 400,000 tourists from around the world.Athletes have said they are concerned about Zika, a virus that has been linked in Brazil to microcephaly, a rare condition that causes abnormally small heads in infants and can lead to developmental problems.But even as athletes express worries about Zika, the organizing committee for the Games said it would charge national delegations to have mosquito screens on athletes rooms.The screens, one measure Brazilians are using to help ward off the mosquito that is the primary transmitter of Zika, will be installed in communal areas where required, but affixed to lodging only if national delegations decide to pay for it, said Philip Wilkinson, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organizing committee."}
{"text": "For all the furious debate over constitutional rights rekindled by the first Supreme Court  abortion case in nearly a decade, the stated goal of the law at issue is a medical one: ensuring patient safety.Proponents say that the Texas law will give women who have abortions better access to emergency treatment should complications arise, while providing greater oversight of their doctors. But many mainstream health care groups, who analyzed the law on its medical merits, say the measures are unnecessary and could even compromise patient well-being.Two provisions of the 2013 law are before the court, which will hear arguments in the case on Wednesday. One requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic. The other requires all abortion facilities to meet the specifications of ambulatory surgical centers, which have more staff and equipment, and are more expensive to manage.The common-sense measures Texas has put in place elevate the standard of care and protect the health of Texas women, Kenneth Paxton Jr., the attorney general of Texas, said in November after the Supreme Court had agreed to hear the case.Major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, contend that the measures are out of step with modern medical practice. If the provisions are allowed to stand, they said, clinics would be forced to close, compelling women to seek riskier alternatives.Abortion, they said, is a quick procedure with low complication rates. A study published in January 2015 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, looked at 54,911 abortions through Californias Medicaid program. The overall complication rate was 2.1 percent. Major complications (including hospital admission, surgery or blood transfusion) occurred in 0.23 percent of the patients. The national mortality rate for abortions from 2008 to 2011 was 0.73 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Medical groups note that other outpatient procedures with higher complication and mortality rates, like colonoscopy and liposuction, are not legislatively mandated to be performed at ambulatory surgical centers by physicians with hospital privileges.Legislators in Texas and other states that have passed similar restrictions cite as a medical rationale the notorious case of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia doctor who was arrested in 2010 and convicted in 2013 of murder and involuntary manslaughter in connection with late-term abortions performed at a filthy clinic.But many medical professionals say that the Gosnell case was an outlier, a failure of Pennsylvania health officials who, despite having received numerous complaints, did not inspect his clinic for 16 years.Still, requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital would most likely identify unqualified doctors, the laws proponents say. The process is extensive. Doctors credentials are vetted rigorously and their hospital records are reviewed regularly. If Dr. Gosnell had begun such a process, it would have quickly revealed that he was not board-certified in obstetrics or gynecology.Another benefit, proponents say, is continuity of patient care. Doctors who perform abortions, particularly in rural areas, may travel among facilities, rather than have a full-time position at one clinic, said Dr. Ingrid P. Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist in San Antonio, who does not perform abortions. So its virtually unheard-of that any of them would be able to take care of a complication, said Dr. Skop, who testified at legislative hearings in favor of the law. If I have a patient with a complication, Id want to take care of her in the hospital.Also, physicians with hospital privileges, she said, are regularly monitored for the complication rates of patients they admit to the hospital.But there are many obstacles not only to gaining admitting privileges, but also to maintaining them.Physicians are required to live and work near the hospital where they have privileges, so they can take on-call shifts and attend administrative meetings. Because doctors willing to perform abortions are scarce in some areas, those who do the procedure may travel great distances to far-flung clinics. Doctors concerned about their safety may not live near an abortion clinic.Furthermore, abortion providers are often denied privileges at hundreds of hospitals with religious affiliations.Hugh P. Greeley, an expert on hospital credentialing, said the privileges provision is out of sync with how complications might unfold. According to the C.D.C., about 25 percent of women who terminate pregnancies during the first trimester choose medical rather than surgical abortion, taking pills dispensed by a clinic that allow them to miscarry at home. If they needed medical attention for a complication like excessive bleeding, they would go to their local emergency room, which would most likely not be a hospital where the clinic doctor has admitting privileges.And almost all emergency room patients are seen by an emergency room physician. A private attending physician no longer meets you in the E.R., Mr. Greeley said. That ended years ago with Marcus Welby.There is also a catch-22, Mr. Greeley said. To maintain hospital privileges, a physician must admit or treat a minimum number of patients each year, usually between 12 and 30. But doctors who perform abortions rarely have occasion to admit a patient. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, there were 63,849 abortions in 2013. Thirty complications were reported. There were no cases of sepsis infection. No patients died.With so few complications, a doctor would be hard-pressed to admit enough patients to keep hospital privileges.Hospital groups see this provision as burdensome. Before the law passed, the Texas Hospital Association, which represents 450 hospitals, said in a statement that requiring hospital admitting privileges for physicians who do not provide services inside the hospital is time-consuming and expensive for the hospital.The requirement that abortion facilities meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical center is just good medicine, said Dr. Donna J. Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Many requirements of surgical centers, she said, have to do with how quickly you can move a patient. There are wide hallways for gurneys to turn corners, so people can move the patient and resuscitation equipment to an ambulance. Surgical centers, she said, have sophisticated equipment to deal with adverse responses to anesthesia.Dr. David A. Grimes, who has written about abortion safety and is a former chief of abortion surveillance for the C.D.C., contested the need for such accommodations.The ambulance brings in its own narrow stretcher, we move the patient to it, and we put it back in the ambulance, he said.To upgrade to an ambulatory surgical center, commonly known as an A.S.C., clinics must comply with lengthy specifications covering construction, ventilation and parking. Andrea Ferrigno, the corporate vice president for Whole Womans Health, the lead petitioners in the Supreme Court case, estimated that the cost per facility would range from $1.5 million to $2 million, not including purchasing property.Dr. Lisa K. Perriera, a Philadelphia obstetrician-gynecologist, has performed abortions in clinics and ambulatory surgical centers. The procedures are the same, she said.For surgical abortions, she said, clinics already have crash carts, a defibrillator and intubation equipment. In an emergency, providers at either a clinic or a surgical center would have the patient transferred to a hospital.If the justices uphold the law, 10 or so Texas clinics could close, shifting abortions to nine A.S.C.s in urban areas. The backlog of patients would rise precipitously. The wait for an appointment with an abortion provider in the Dallas-Fort Worth area is already 21 days, Ms. Ferrigno said.And, she noted, the risk of complication for the procedure increases with each week of gestation."}
{"text": "GOTEBORG, Sweden   Three decades after Prime Minister Olof Palme was gunned down on a Stockholm street, his unsolved killing continues to reverberate through Swedish politics and society.In the prelude to the 30th anniversary of the shooting on Sunday, news organizations are recounting a range of theories about the identity and possible motivation of the killer, including that the crime had been committed by an unemployed Swede with a grudge, or by an American acting on orders from the Pinochet government in Chile. One tabloid published a list of items this week to help younger readers understand the leader who put Sweden on the world map.The continued fascination with Mr. Palme stems in part from the mysteries surrounding his death  he was shot as he and his wife, Lisbet, walked home without bodyguards from a movie on a Friday night  and in part from his legacy as the embodiment of left-leaning values that once seemed to define his country: commitment to a robust welfare state at home and a foreign policy driven by moral considerations.To those who remember him, Mr. Palme represents an image of Sweden that is now, to say the least, in flux, especially in the rise of a far-right party and in a growing sense that the country can no longer afford to be as welcoming to refugees as it has been. Yet he retains relevance to Sweden in other ways, not least in its diplomacy efforts in the Middle East and in the pressures of dealing with Russian aggression.Our idea of Sweden back then was of a bucolic, tranquil haven, where leaders lived like the ordinary people, said Jonas Hinnfors, professor of politics at the University of Goteborg. Yet suddenly, there lies the prime minister in his own blood, and the legal system fails to find the killer. Our self-image was shattered.He continued, But his death also came at a time of broader transition and more or less marked the end of the old Sweden he epitomized.As leader of the Social Democratic Party, Mr. Palme backed labor unions over business. He was a critic of the Vietnam War, of apartheid and of repressive governments in Eastern Europe and Latin America. He was an early supporter of gender equality, backed what became one of the highest tax rates among industrialized countries, and supported both nuclear disarmament and the use of nuclear power as a way to diminish dependence on fossil fuels.He was often characterized as steering a third way between communism and capitalism, but he drew criticism for being anti-business and too soft on Moscow.Late on the evening of Feb. 28, 1986, Mr. Palme was walking through central Stockholm when he was shot in the back at point-blank range. He was 59. A second shot aimed at his wife only grazed her.After almost three years of bungled investigations into the murder, the police arrested Christer Pettersson, an unemployed man with a history of drug and alcohol abuse and a violent criminal record, and charged him with the killing. Mr. Pettersson was jailed for life, but he challenged the verdict, and conflicting evidence led to the convictions being overturned in 1989.Mr. Palmes family members have said they remain convinced that Mr. Pettersson was the killer. And Ulf Dahlsten, a senior civil servant in Mr. Palmes last administration, revealed on Monday that he had received information 20 years ago that Mr. Pettersson had approached members of Mr. Palmes staff to learn about the prime ministers habits and movement. Mr. Dahlsten said he had stayed silent about the information out of respect for his informers privacy.It is time that we in Sweden accept that the killer was from inside Sweden, Mr. Dahlsten wrote in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter. It was not a foreign power. Not a security service, not South Africa, not Iraq, not Iran, not Israel. And not Kurds or Croats. Not someone else we can conveniently blame. He referred to countries and groups that have, at various times, been linked to the killing.But this month, a survey for the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet of 50 experts closely associated with the Palme case found that only a minority felt certain of Mr. Petterssons guilt.People love conspiracies because there are good reasons to be suspicious, Joakim Palme, Mr. Palmes eldest son and a professor of politics at Uppsala University in the east of the country, said in a telephone interview. My father had enemies who were prepared to act.Joakim Palme pointed to a confession by an American citizen that he had received orders from inside the Pinochet government in the 1970s to kill the prime minister. Only this week, a witness at the cinema that the prime minister attended the night he was killed claimed to have seen a man resembling a known American agent working for the Chilean secret services under Gen. Augusto Pinochet.Olof Palmes transformation from the son of an elite military family to the workers friend, his idealistic solidarity with the third world and his insistence on speaking out about injustice regardless of the diplomatic consequences seemed to leave some Swedes hoping that the investigation would show that he had been martyred for his politics, rather than killed by a thug.The police followed leads that had nothing to do with Mr. Palmes politics to deflect the investigation from potentially embarrassing matters, said Gunnar Wall, the author of three books on the investigation into Mr. Palmes death.It was understood at a very early stage that this case could be very sensitive, and with negative effects for the government and the authorities, Mr. Wall added.Mr. Palme was killed during a period of Cold War fears fueled by frequent reports of Soviet submarines in Swedish waters, and as he faced accusations that he was too soft on Moscow.Russia continues to exert an influence on Swedish policies. Two years ago, a suspected sighting of a mysterious submarine near Stockholm led to a frenzy of indignation at purported Russian militarism. After Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014, Sweden increased military spending and moved closer to ending its position as a neutral state.Fear of Russia is just one aspect of an increasingly shrill political climate in Sweden that is reminiscent of the polarization of Mr. Palmes era. The rise of the far-right Sweden Democrats has stoked a fierce debate over the limits to the welcome that should be shown to newly arriving refugees.There are also echoes of Mr. Palmes approach to foreign policy in the stances taken by the current foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, a Social Democrat. Her criticism of medieval punishments in Saudi Arabia and of Israeli violence against Palestinians have led to diplomatic breaches  and have prompted Ms. Wallstrom to be compared to Mr. Palme.He was driven by values, fearless, and a master of rhetoric, Ms. Wallstrom said in an email. This continues to inspire us today."}

First, it argues that the government is trying to force it to create software that does not exist. What is more, the company says writing that software would amount to hacking its own technology.Apple claims this would create a security risk for all iPhone customers, especially because other government agencies in the United States and abroad could then demand Apples assistance in other cases. In a court filing, Apple disclosed that there were nine other cases in which the Justice Department has asked for its help unlocking phones.The F.B.I., for its part, says that Apple is overstating the issue, since the bureau is asking for the companys help breaking into only one phone, not phones all over the world.The technology industry and the government have been wrangling for years over the growing use of encryption in communication tools that make it much harder for law enforcement and spy agencies to gather information in investigations.That fight took on new urgency in 2013 after documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed extensive government spying on Internet traffic.On Feb. 16, a federal judge issued an order compelling Apple to assist the F.B.I. and gave the company until Feb. 26 to respond.Apples chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, wrote a letter to customers warning of the chilling breach of privacy sought by the government and vowed to appeal. The F.B.I. shot back, calling Apples position a marketing strategy.On Thursday, Apple filed a formal response to the court order, asking the judge to vacate it. The company said that the order violated its First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights and exceeded the powers granted to the government in the All Writs Act, the 1789 law that the court had used to compel Apples assistance.Apple argues that software code can be treated as speech under the First Amendment, and that the court order violated due process because it deprives the company of its right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of its liberty by government.The court will consider Apples request. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google plan to file one or more briefs next week supporting Apples position.Both the F.B.I. and Apple say they want Congress to weigh in. On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on encryption issues. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., and Apples top lawyer are among those scheduled to testify."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   If the temporary cease-fire in Syria begins to take hold on Saturday, despite the low expectations of the American and Russian officials who negotiated the agreement, it will be a landmark event. For the first time, diplomacy will have succeeded in abating the killing and misery that have already led to more than 250,000 deaths and millions of refugees pouring out of the shattered country.But like everything else in the bloody five-year civil war, even the accord to limit the shooting has come at a high price, not least for President Obama.In the estimate of European and Israeli intelligence officials, but not the White House, the pause in fighting may have the unintended consequence of consolidating President Bashar al-Assads hold on power over Syria for at least the next few years. Perhaps more important, if it proves successful, it may also begin to freeze in place what already amounts to an informal partition of the country, even though the stated objective of the West is to keep the country whole.The cessation of hostilities, as it is officially known, that began midnight Friday is the first real product of a diplomatic push that Secretary of State John Kerry has made his all-consuming mission since last summer, when he struck the nuclear accord with Iran. Testifying in Congress this week, Mr. Kerry acknowledged that with so many players involved  Russian forces in the air, Iranian ground troops, dispirited and fractious opposition groups that say they have received too little aid from the West, and Mr. Assads own forces  this resembles a Hail Mary pass.I know this: If it doesnt work, the potential is there that Syria will be utterly destroyed, Mr. Kerry said. The fact is that we need to make certain that we are exploring and exhausting every option of diplomatic resolution.At the same time he conceded in his Senate testimony that the White House was already preparing a Plan B in the event that we dont succeed at the table  a mix of military options that, so far, administration officials say Mr. Obama has rejected. On Friday, fighting raged on several fronts in Syria as combatants sought to gain last-minute advantages before the cease-fire.Dozens of barrel bombs and other munitions fell on the suburbs of Damascus, Syrias capital. Rebels there said the suburb of Daraya was a bastion of insurgents who were not affiliated with either the Nusra Front or the Islamic State, the only two groups not exempted from attack because they are designated by the United Nations as terrorist organizations. But the Syrian government said Daraya was not covered under any truce, suggesting those attacks might continue.While most of the major rebel groups that oppose the Assad government have signed on to the cease-fire, many said that if their forces are hit by the Russians and the Syrians  even by an attack meant to target the Islamic State or the Nusra Front  they would retaliate.But the issue has become even more complicated by what the deal may or may not portend for Mr. Assads future, and how the cease-fire affects his ability to hold onto the presidency.Last summer, with Mr. Assads forces reeling, many intelligence agencies were speculating that he could be forced from office by the end of 2015. Then came the Russian and Iranian interventions. His fortunes have changed dramatically.Now European and Israeli officials contend that this preliminary agreement essentially abandons what was once a precondition of the Obama administration and the opposition groups: that Mr. Assad must go as part of any political deal.There is a low prospect that this will work, because there are spoilers on both sides, there are opposition groups that wont respect the cease-fire, and we cant trust the Russians will limit their military action to specific terrorist groups, said Philip H. Gordon, who was one of Mr. Obamas top Middle East advisers on the National Security Council until last year.But Mr. Gordon sees a subtle shift in the administrations position. For almost five years the opposition groups and their representatives have said they cannot agree to a cease-fire without agreement on a political process for Assads eventual removal, he noted. Now that has changed.Mr. Obama still talks about the need for Mr. Assad to go. After holding a National Security Council meeting at the State Department on Thursday, he said Syrias future cannot include Bashar al-Assad.Its clear that after years of his barbaric war against his own people, including torture and barrel bombs and sieges and starvation, many Syrians will never stop fighting until Assad is out of power, Mr. Obama said. Theres no alternative to a managed transition away from Assad.But at the United Nations on Friday, the resolutions embracing the cease-fire also seemed to give some political cover to the military gains the Russians  along with Iranian forces and Mr. Assads Alawite-dominated army  have made, including the encirclement of Aleppo.Mr. Gordon noted that the cessation of hostilities agreement may effectively start to develop into a de facto partition of the country, whereby different ethnic groups control the regions they are currently holding. That is what worries the Israelis, who see a Syrian-Russian-Iranian axis developing on their border, a group that already has the support of the terrorist group Hezbollah.Over time, European and Israeli officials say, the cease-fire may give Mr. Assad lasting control of the string of major cities  Damascus to Homs to Aleppo  that are now increasingly in his control, thanks to Russian and Iranian support. And it begins to etch out other territory for the Sunni opposition groups backed by Washington and the Arab states, while giving a sliver in the north to the Kurds.John Kirby, Mr. Kerrys spokesman, disputes the idea that the agreement would carve Syria along the existing battle lines. You need to look at the text, he said. Every document includes explicit commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria, and you could argue that weve actually made a stronger commitment against partition than ever before, because all of the parties have signed on to that notion.A senior administration official, who would not speak on the record about the internal White House deliberations, argued that the separate enclaves were temporary and would make it possible for negotiations on a political settlement to get started.What is the alternative? he asked.The question is whether the cease-fire becomes an end unto itself, or whether it leads to the talks that Mr. Kerry has envisioned as the centerpiece of the Vienna process, a negotiating path laid out by all of Syrias neighbors in an agreement announced in the Austrian capital late last year.On Friday the United Nations mediator, Staffan de Mistura, said he hoped the pause could allow desperately needed food and medicine to get into towns under siege for months and, if the truce holds, pave the way for political negotiations to resume on March 7.It is, potentially, a historic junction  to bring an end to the killing and destruction and to start a new life and new hope for the Syrians, Mr. de Mistura said.That is the optimistic view. The more pessimistic one is that the cessation becomes what the French ambassador to the United Nations, Franois Delattre, called a smoke screen allowing someone to crush the Syrian civilians and the opposition."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM  RENEE RABINOWITZ is a sharp-witted retired lawyer with a Ph.D. in educational psychology, who escaped the Nazis in Europe as a child. Now she is about to become a test case in the battle over religion and gender in Israels public spaces  and the skies above  as the plaintiff in a lawsuit accusing El Al, the national airline, of discrimination.Ms. Rabinowitz was comfortably settled into her aisle seat in the business-class section on El Al Flight 028 from Newark to Tel Aviv in December when, as she put it, this rather distinguished-looking man in Hasidic or Haredi garb, Id guess around 50 or so, shows up.The man was assigned the window seat in her row. But, like many ultra-Orthodox male passengers, he did not want to sit next to a woman, seeing even inadvertent contact with the opposite sex as verboten under the strictest interpretation of Jewish law. Soon, Ms. Rabinowitz said, a flight attendant offered her a better seat, up front, closer to first class.Reluctantly, Ms. Rabinowitz, an impeccably groomed 81-year-old grandmother who walks with a cane because of bad knees, agreed.Despite all my accomplishments  and my age is also an accomplishment  I felt minimized, she recalled in a recent interview in her elegantly appointed apartment in a fashionable neighborhood of Jerusalem.For me this is not personal, Ms. Rabinowitz added. It is intellectual, ideological and legal. I think to myself, here I am, an older woman, educated, Ive been around the world, and some guy can decide that I shouldnt sit next to him. Why?That is just what many feminists and advocates of religious pluralism in Israel and abroad have been asking in what by all accounts is a growing phenomenon of religious Jewish men refusing to sit next to women on airplanes. Several flights from New York to Israel, on El Al and other airlines, have been delayed or disrupted as women refused to move, and there have been social media campaigns including a protest petition.Just this week, in a different but related situation, an ultra-Orthodox man created a disturbance on an El Al flight from Warsaw to Tel Aviv to protest the screening of Truth, starring Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford, a movie he deemed immodest, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot reported.Now, a liberal advocacy group that had spent two years searching for a test case on switching seats plans to sue the blue-and-white flag carrier on Ms. Rabinowitzs behalf in a Tel Aviv court next week.We needed a case of a flight attendant being actively involved, explained the groups director, Anat Hoffman, to show that El Al has internalized the commandment, I cannot sit next to a woman.An El Al spokeswoman said in a statement that any discrimination between passengers is strictly prohibited.El Al flight attendants are on the front line of providing service for the companys varied array of passengers, the statement said. In the cabin, the attendants receive different and varied requests and they try to assist as much as possible, the goal being to have the plane take off on time and for all the passengers to arrive at their destination as scheduled.Ms. Hoffmans group, the Israel Religious Action Center, the public and legal advocacy arm of the Reform Movement in Israel, previously fought Israeli bus companies and the Ministry of Transportation over gender segregation on so-called kosher lines that serve ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. The Supreme Court in 2011 made it illegal to require women to sit in the back of the bus and allowed men and women to sit separately only if they did so voluntarily. Two years later, Israels attorney general issued guidelines calling on government ministries and public agencies to end all manifestations of gender segregation in the public sphere.THE group has since turned its focus skyward. Ms. Rabinowitz attended a lecture by Ms. Hoffman a few weeks after her fateful flight. The topic of seat switching came up, and Ms. Rabinowitz told Ms. Hoffman it had happened to her.When I told Anat that the flight attendant had asked me to move, she got very excited, Ms. Rabinowitz recalled.Ms. Rabinowitz, who moved to Jerusalem from the United States about a decade ago, says that she is not anti-Haredi  the Hebrew term for ultra-Orthodox, meaning one who trembles before God  and she comes with her own God-fearing credentials.Born in Belgium, she fled with her family during the Nazi occupation in 1941. She had a religious upbringing, attended an Orthodox Jewish school in New York, where a strictly modest dress code applied, and she still observes most of the laws of the Sabbath. Both her second husband, who died three years ago, and her first (they divorced in 1986) were rabbis.She described one of her grandchildren as being Hasidic or Haredi, and said, The idea of having a Haredi population is wonderful, as long as they dont tell me what to do.Ms. Rabinowitz had been visiting family in New York before boarding the Dec. 2 El Al flight home. By her account, the flight attendant had a brief conversation in Hebrew with her ultra-Orthodox seatmate-to-be, which she could not understand, then persuaded Ms. Rabinowitz to come and see the better seat, at the end of a row of three.There were two women seated there, she said. I thought, Oy, if they are going to talk all night I am not going to be happy. She asked the flight attendant if he was suggesting the switch because the man next to her wanted her to move, she said, and he said yes without any hesitation.WHEN Ms. Rabinowitz returned to her original seat to collect her hand luggage, with the attendants assistance, she asked the other passenger, Why does it matter? Im 81 years old. And he says, Its in the Torah. After briefly arguing the point, she moved to the new seat. I thought, Hes going to be unhappy, she recalled. There was no other seat available for him next to a man so I thought Id try it.The other women in the new row were busy working and did not chatter. Still, Ms. Rabinowitz said she felt further insulted because the attendant had tried to mislead her.The flight attendant treated me as if I was stupid, she said, but thats a common problem in Israel if you dont speak Hebrew. They assume things about you. They assume they can put one over you.A lawyer for the religious action group wrote a letter to El Al last month saying that Ms. Rabinowitz had felt pressured by the attendant and accusing El Al of illegal discrimination. It argued that a request not to be seated next to a woman differed from other requests to move, say, to sit near a relative or a friend, because it was by nature degrading. The lawyer demanded 50,000 shekels, about $13,000, in compensation for Ms. Rabinowitz.The airline offered, instead, a $200 discount on Ms. Rabinowitzs next El Al flight. It insisted that there was no gender discrimination on El Al flights, that the flight attendant had made it clear to Ms. Rabinowitz that she was in no way obligated to move, and that she had changed seats without argument.Ms. Rabinowitz has since had time to ponder. She said her son told her that this whole idea that you cannot sit next to a woman is bogus. She cited an eminent Orthodox scholar, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who counseled that it was acceptable for a Jewish man to sit next to a woman on a subway or a bus so long as there was no intention to seek sexual pleasure from any incidental contact.When did modesty become the sum and end all of being a Jewish woman? Ms. Rabinowitz asked. Citing examples like the biblical warrior Deborah, the matriarch Sarah and Queen Esther, she noted: Our heroes in history were not modest little women."}
{"text": "When Kurt Rambis took over as interim coach of the Knicks this month, he set a lofty goal of steering the team with a 23-31 record to the playoffs.Despite Rambiss edict, the Knicks have lost 13 of their last 16 games. Before Fridays contest against the Orlando Magic at Madison Square Garden, Rambis clarified his aspirations, saying the players needed to shift their attitude and believe they are worthy of the postseason.In making that statement, to me its more of a mind-set, Rambis said. You have to have this mind-set of a player of Were going to win. You want to think of yourself as an individual  you want to think of this team as winners.For one night, at least, the Knicks used balanced scoring  seven players tallied double figures including all five starters, led by Carmelo Anthonys 19 points  to easily handle the Magic, 108-95.On Thursday, after another demoralizing defeat, in which Anthony had air-balled a potential tying 3-point attempt at the buzzer against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks shifted the focus of their practice to the film room.They emphasized protecting the paint (stopping inside penetration) and also closing in on shooters so they are not left scrambling to help one another when the ball is quickly passed around the perimeter.Its a two-part component and youve got to be connected and engaged in order to make that happen well, Rambis said.As Rambis explained his approach to ironing out the Knicks defensive deficiencies that have contributed to their plunge in the standings, he frequently gestured with his hands and circled his fingers in the air, dictating what players should be doing and where they should be on the court.The connection that hes talking about, if somebody gets beat you have their back; if that person gets beat, you have their back, Anthony said. Everybodys on this train. A lot of time recently, we havent been connected as a team like that. I thought tonight we did a better job of being connected.The Knicks trailed early, but were sustained by Jose Calderons 10 first-quarter points. At one point, with the Knicks leading by 23-17, Elfrid Payton snared a long rebound and drove down the court, beating Calderon while Kyle OQuinn hesitated and then did not commit to stop the uncontested dunk.Rambis angrily called timeout, and OQuinn tried to explain himself walking back to the bench. Perhaps showing how committed he is to drilling in the new defensive mentality, Rambis did not play OQuinn after the first quarter.If the Knicks defense showed some improvement, the Magic were out of sync from the start. Whenever they began to chip away at the Knicks lead, which was as large as 24 points in the third quarter, it seemed the Knicks broke down the Magics defense with crisp, quick give-and-go passes for easy baskets.The Knicks also won the battle inside, picking up 36 free-throw attempts and making 30. They held a 62-44 lead at halftime, with 28 points in the paint.I kept writing on the board, Paint and paint  protect the paint at the defensive end, attack the paint at the offensive end, Rambis said.With 8 minutes 54 seconds remaining in the second quarter, a putback layup by Kristaps Porzingis gave the Knicks a 40-29 advantage, and the Magic never trimmed the deficit to single digits. Porzingis added 18 points on 7 for 15 shooting, and fared well down on the block against the strength of Magic forward Aaron Gordon.Porzingis said he frequently peppered Anthony with questions on how to improve his low-post scoring  whether it be when they are soaking in the tub after a game or if he pulls up a highlight video of Anthony on Instagram and asks how to duplicate his move set.With the Knicks showing no signs of cracking against a dull effort by the Magic, the home crowd began chanting for Jimmer Fredette, the recent call-up, early in the third quarter. Throughout the night, the call periodically rose again, reaching a crescendo as the final minutes ticked down.But Rambis never called on Fredette. Instead, the crowd would have to be placated by the Knicks first home win since Jan. 29.REBOUNDSThe Knicks shot 46.2 percent from the field, including 4 of 16 on 3-point attempts."}
{"text": "TOKYO  Japans population shrank by nearly a million during the last half-decade, official census figures confirmed on Friday, an unprecedented drop for a society not ravaged by war or other deadly crisis, and one that helps explain the countrys persistent economic woes.It was the first time since Japan began collecting census data in 1920 that a nationwide count recorded a decline in the population, though surveys based on smaller samples have shown a downward trend for years.The population stood at 127.1 million in 2015, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said, down by 947,000, or 0.7 percent, compared with the last census in 2010.A shrinking population creates ripples that are felt from the economy to politics.With one of the lowest birthrates in the world and little immigration, Japan has seen this milestone coming for years, if not decades. Yet efforts by the government to encourage women to have more children have had little effect, and there is little public support for opening the doors to mass immigration.These numbers are like losing an entire prefecture, Shigeru Ishiba, a cabinet minister in charge of efforts to revitalize Japans especially depopulated rural areas, said at a news conference. A handful of Japans 47 prefectures, administrative districts similar to provinces or states, have populations of less than a million.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe responded to the census report by reiterating a long-term goal of keeping the population from falling below 100 million. Projections by the government and international bodies like the United Nations suggest that will be difficult, however. The latest United Nations estimates suggest that Japans population will fall to 83 million by the end of the century, down 40 percent from its peak.Mr. Abes goal depends on raising the birthrate to 1.8 children per woman, up from 1.4 now and higher than it has been since the early 1980s. Rates have, in fact, risen slightly compared with a decade ago. But with women marrying later  in part, demographers say, to avoid pressure to give up their careers  a more decisive turnaround looks far off.Japan will not necessarily suffer just because it is smaller. Many countries with fewer people are just as prosperous, and in a country known for jam-packed rush-hour trains, there may even be benefits. Japans economic output has been stagnant for years, but the picture looks less dire, economists say, once a shrinking work force is taken into account.The real problem, experts say, is less the size of the familiar population pyramid but its shape  in Japans case, it has changed. Because the low birthrate means each generation is smaller than the last, it has flipped on its head, with a bulging cohort of older Japanese at the top supported by a narrow base of young people.One-quarter of Japanese are now over 65, and that percentage is expected to reach 40 percent by 2060. Pension and health care costs are growing even as the workers needed to pay for them become scarcer.The population is shrinking more in some places than others. The biggest cities, like Tokyo, are still growing, while rural areas struggle to cope with abandoned homes and shuttered shops. The imbalance has created political tensions: The most depopulated areas send three times as many representatives to Parliament, per capita, as urban ones do.The Supreme Court has declared the situation unconstitutional, but Mr. Abes conservative governing party  which has strong support in the countryside  has dragged its feet on redrawing electoral districts.The government made several small adjustments last year, but Mr. Abe said in Parliament on Friday that a more ambitious realignment would wait until the next census in 2020."}

{"text": "One day during the past few weeks you may have noticed, on the subway home from work, an ad that wasnt like the others, in part because it didnt promote an app that could deliver a grain bowl, or a dog groomer, or a pack of C batteries and a gallon of Tide to your door in 19 minutes, and in part because it might have nudged you toward your essential prudishness.The ad campaign, for Thinx, microfiber underwear that wicks away moisture, making tampons virtually unnecessary (Underwear for women with periods, as the tagline goes), is an artfully produced exercise in the spirit of Girls feminism. One ad features a model wearing the underwear  chic, substantial, black  and a turtleneck; another uses the picture of an egg yolk. If you take issue with any of this you are probably lurching arthritically toward irrelevance. Last fall, when the company submitted the ads to Outfront Media, the agency that handles advertising in the subway for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, it was told that the ovum imagery was inappropriate and that the ads generally featured too much skin. The largely millennial, largely female staff at Thinx found the response benighted and hypocritical.Thinx underwear is the invention of Miki Agrawal, a Cornell University graduate of Indian and Japanese parentage, and Canadian upbringing, along with her twin sister, Radha, and a friend, Antonia Saint Dunbar. Miki Agrawal runs the company out of a co-working space in the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Chelsea called the Center for Social Innovation. On the day I met her she was wearing a hat and torn jeans as she looked out from a tiny office toward the 30 people who worked for her, many of whom were eating dark leafy salads. Replying to the initial judgments of Outfront Media, Ms. Agrawal wrote back that her product empowered women in ways that various lewd ads already visible in the subways clearly did not.There was the objectifying ad for weight-loss pills featuring a woman in a string bikini, for instance, and another for breast enhancement with the line Made in New York running over a picture of a woman with an unnaturally large chest, in a low-cut bathing suit. Unwilling to alter the content of her ads, Ms. Agrawal contacted someone at mic.com who wrote about the controversy, at which point a wave of feminist outrage was unleashed on the Internet. Eventually, the ads ran precisely as they were submitted. To parents who might object to their children seeing them, Ms. Agrawal said any child who might inquire about the campaign on the R train could get a useful lesson in life creation.Ms. Agrawal, who is in her 30s, is part of a generation and a broad clique in New York and Silicon Valley that believe in entrepreneurialism as a way toward global salvation. Some portion of the sales from Thinx go to supply women with reusable menstrual pads in Uganda, where feminine-hygiene products are not easily available. Worried about our environmentally straining reliance on toilet paper, Ms. Agrawal is working on making a small cleansing device that would attach to the side of a toilet, the Apple meets Nest product of bidets, as she calls it.She lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where several of her friends, many of whom are involved with start-ups, also live. They often eat and ideate together, she told me.Radha Agrawal is also a founder of Daybreaker, an international movement of drug-and-alcohol-free early-morning dance parties that are meant for networking and for energizing the creatively purposeful. Its only the middle-aged and diminishingly ambitious who view fun as an end itself.Miki Agrawal, who has been profiled in a fashion issue of New York magazine and has had an audience with Gloria Steinem, also owns two organic-and-gluten-free-pizza restaurants, called Wild, one in Williamsburg and the other in the West Village.How does someone come to such a varied career? On Sept. 11, 2001, Ms. Agrawal was a 22-year-old beginning a job in the investment banking division at Deutsche Bank at 130 Liberty Street, across the street from ground zero. On that morning she overslept. I had written down three things I wanted to do with the rest of my life after 9/11, Ms. Agrawal told me. She wanted to play professional soccer, work in film and start a business.Soccer had been a lifelong passion, and when Ms. Agrawal tried out for the New York Magic, a semiprofessional womens team, she won a spot. In her first game out, she tore an anterior cruciate ligament, leaving her unable to play for a year. When she returned, she soon tore the A.C.L. in her other knee. After that happened, I said, O.K. universe, I get it, this is not my calling, she told me.She moved onto film, where she found herself undone by the yucky processed food laid out by craft services. This gave her the idea of going into the healthy restaurant business, and she worked to raise $250,000 from investors to get things going.Running from restaurant to restaurant, Id have monthly accidents, she told me. There werent period-tracker apps back then.But it wasnt until a while later, when she and Radha were defending their status as champions of a three-legged race at a family reunion, that the idea for a kind of advanced undergarment came to her. (Radha had gotten her period in the middle of the race.) The business did not develop until 2010. That was when Ms. Agrawal was on a trip to Johannesburg to attend the World Cup and met a girl who was forced to take a week off from school every month, when she was menstruating, because she had no access to feminine-hygiene supplies. It occurred to Ms. Agrawal, she said, that such hygiene was a root cause of cyclical poverty in the developing world.Another round of ads should be coming from her company shortly. These will promote a second type of leakproof underwear, for women dealing with bouts of incontinence that often follow pregnancy. Ms. Agrawal would like to have a baby soon, she said, and she would like to raise that baby communally."}

{"text": "At Fifty Third and Eighth, a condominium development at 301 West 53rd Street, almost everything is for sale. Beyond the apartments themselves, the modern leather sofas, nubby rugs and factory-inspired lamps displayed in model units are all available for purchase. So are the crisp bedsheets, fluffy towels, multicolored bowls and streamlined flatware used to accessorize the spaces.That offering is the result of a partnership between the HFZ Capital Group, the developer, and the furniture retailer Design Within Reach, which dressed up five model units with product availability in mind. If buyers fall in love with a particular model apartment, they can buy the whole furniture package, ranging from about $39,000 to $60,000, for their new home. If they want to expand the selection, or change a few of the pieces, they can meet with a member of the retailers sales team. Or, if theyre smitten only with the $9,400 sofa, they can order just that single piece.At a time when it seems as if every new development offers increasingly chic model units, and as upscale home staging becomes ever more commonplace, a number of developers in New York are taking showcase apartments to the next logical step  offering complete turnkey homes to buyers through furniture packages, interior design consultations and move-in-ready apartments where all the decorating is already done. Rather than merely showing buyers aspirational model units that demonstrate what their apartments could potentially look like, these developers are presenting comprehensive design visions that can be bought on the spot.When sales began at Fifty Third and Eighth, in February 2015, the development team had created preliminary model units designed by Ash NYC, a design and development firm, purely for show. But when people began inquiring about buying those units furnished, the team switched strategies and partnered with Design Within Reach to create new model units in a similar modern style, where such purchases are encouraged.The more that people were asking, the more we thought it would be a great idea to offer this to the market, said Reid Price, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate who is the director of sales for the project. Its one more way to differentiate our product.Jordan Feldman, an associate of HFZ, noted that a lot of people are first-time buyers here, who sometimes struggle to envision a completed home. Even though we already had model units, we thought we could attract a lot more buyers by making them feel like everythings been done for them already.The program has attracted four buyers since it was introduced last November, including some who will use their apartments as pieds--terre, said Daniel Gaouette, an account executive at Design Within Reach. I have a client right now who needs it done quickly because shes going to be gone for the next three months, he said. She just wants some in-stock pieces, so she feels comfortable.At 101 Wall, a financial district condominium, the developer, the Claremont Group, is offering something similar. It has created a range of furniture packages with the projects designer, Amsterdam-based Piet Boon, and Lepere, the New York showroom that sells Mr. Boons muscular, minimalist furniture collection. Each design scheme includes a number of suggested furniture layouts and three color palettes from which to choose.When buyers move in, they can have the full Piet experience, from flooring to furniture to carpets to drapes to accessories, said John Lari, a principal of the Claremont Group. If it helps us get our buyers excited and makes it a less stressful process and move for them, were all for it.Mr. Boon said, Its a total concept, but customized for the customer, noting that Lepere will coordinate changes and personalization of the packages with his office. My intention is not to make a standard unit, but something special for each person.Dominic Lepere, the owner of Lepere, added: Its full service. Well meet with buyers throughout the process, help select everything, and then coordinate the shipping logistics and final installation.The developments sales team will begin offering the packages, which range from about $90,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to about $150,000 for a three-bedroom, to buyers in the coming weeks.Riham El Batanouny and Oussama Jamal, who live in Cairo and Dubai, are in contract to buy a two-bedroom pied--terre at 101 Wall for about $2.3 million, and plan to take advantage of the program.We went to the sales office, and asked if they had this kind of offering, because its so beautiful, Ms. El Batanouny said. We live overseas, and it would be very difficult for us to go through the whole process of furnishing. To have it given to you as one package is just amazing.At 160 Leroy, a condominium in the West Village, the developer Ian Schrager is offering his own twist on turnkey apartments. Were offering design services that allow you to walk into an apartment that has absolutely everything, he said. You just have to bring your toothbrush.The French designer Christian Liaigre has already designed some furniture pieces exclusively for the building. Working with Mr. Schragers design staff, buyers have access to those and other pieces designed by Mr. Liaigre, along with a range of other products and accessories to create a complete home.You can buy pieces of furniture with consultation and help from my staff, free of charge, or even hire Christian Liaigre to design your apartment, Mr. Schrager said. We do all of it.Some developers are taking the concept a step further by offering complete turnkey apartments that are fully decorated before theyre even listed for sale. At Ralph Walker Tribeca at 100 Barclay Street, the Magnum Real Estate Group and the CIM Group are offering a handful of such apartments designed by the firm Grade.Ben H. Shaoul, the principal of Magnum, said he discovered the demand for turnkey apartments after buyers asked to purchase model units at his previous developments. Some are international and dont want to buy their own furniture or hire a designer, he said. Some are busy businesspeople who dont want to deal with it, and some are people who just like the furniture.The first of four initial turnkey units at Ralph Walker Tribeca is now listed for $12 million, which Mr. Shaoul said is about $1 million more than it would cost empty. It comes complete with Alvar Aalto bentwood armchairs, a Holly Hunt cocktail table and dining chairs, and a Lindsey Adelman branching dining room chandelier.As we sell them, well continue to furnish more units, he said, because we feel theres demand for this in the market.At One57, a condominium at 157 West 57th Street, the Extell Development Company recently hired the designer Jennifer Post to give a three-bedroom unit the head-to-toe designer treatment.Ms. Post not only selected a whole homes worth of furniture, rugs and light fixtures, but also changed the interior architecture. She dropped the living room ceiling slightly to add recessed lighting and create drapery pockets, enclosed structural columns, and built out a living room wall to add light coves and showcase art. She also covered every wall with Venetian plaster or wallcovering, and added custom built-in furniture.Ive been doing this more and more for international buyers, said Ms. Post, explaining that she designs luxury homes from start to finish for clients who just want them completed. These people have three or four homes, and they do not want to come to New York and oversee design and construction.The apartment, which would have been $19.15 million empty, is now listed for $20.1 million. If someone buys it, he or she will get everything but the art (which is on consignment from galleries), right down to the soap, candles and books.It wouldnt be the first furnished apartment to sell in the building, which is about 80 percent sold. A previous apartment that had been designed by Jamie Drake as a model unit sold with all its furniture last September for $28.5 million, $1.5 million above its price empty, when a buyer just had to have the complete package.We were thrilled to sell that residence, and realized there really is a market for people who just want to come in, take it, and move in, said Graham Spearman, a senior sales executive at Extell.The company plans to build more turnkey units at One57, Mr. Spearman said, and at other properties in its portfolio. For us, theres no risk involved, he added, because we know its going to sell."}

On Monday, it begins a four-part docu-series called Major League Legends with a moving episode on Hank Aaron. Every fan knows his triumphant trot around the bases when he broke Babe Ruths major league home run record in 1974, but this program traces the difficult road he traveled to get to that moment.Theres the American dream, and then theres the life that the Aaron family and black families like him actually had to live, says the author Howard Bryant. It was, of course, a path full of the hurdles of racism, even after Aaron became a major leaguer in 1954 and a star. And it placed him in an odd sort of spotlight, acclaimed as a sports hero even as black America as a whole was struggling for equality.Aaron himself contributes remembrances of the hardships and the triumphs. Subsequent episodes turn their attention to Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams."}
{"text": "Without question, the most important liberation movement in American history  from Jacksonian democracy to gay rights  was the long struggle against slavery. Abolition established the principles and rhetoric, while setting the strategies and tactics, that have guided all subsequent reform movements  even those that have stood opposed to one another like prohibitionism and antiprohibitionism, or pro- and anti-abortion rights. Recently, historians have been taking a new look at the struggle against slavery as a way of examining contemporary movements for securing human rights, expanding democracy, liberating colonials and criticizing capitalism.Manisha Sinha, a professor of Afro-American studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is one of those historians who are trying to connect the war against slavery to other liberation movements. She is the author of previous studies of slaveholders and their ideologies. In The Slaves Cause: A History of Abolition, she turns her attention from the slave masters to their greatest opponents, and her new book is an encyclopedic survey of the movement against slavery in the United States from its first stirrings before the American Revolution to the institutions final demise in the ashes of civil war. It is difficult to imagine a more comprehensive history of the abolitionist movement.Sinhas work is also a biographical dictionary, naming practically every individual and group that struck a blow against slavery. She tells us that The Slaves Cause can best be appreciated as an interpretation of abolitions long history, though the seemingly endless detail presented over the course of nearly 600 pages of text and another 100-plus pages of notes frustrates her effort to present a clear alternative narrative to the familiar one.Sinha starts by dividing the history of emancipation into two large waves. The first begins with the Revolution and extends until the 1820s. It established the egalitarian ideology that continued to inform abolition. Embracing the Declaration of Independence and the notion that all were equal in the sight of God, the opponents of slavery put American slaveholders, as Americans and as Christians, on the defensive, deeming them hypocrites. Abolitionists won the first battle of the slavery wars, ending slavery in the Northern states. Northern emancipation was glacially slow, but in time the region became committed to wage labor. The critical division between the free and slave states was established.The second wave began in the third decade of the 19th century with the discovery  or, as others have claimed, fabrication  of the Denmark Vesey conspiracy to organize a slave uprising in Charleston (1822); the publication of David Walkers abolitionist pamphlet Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World (1829); and the emergence of William Lloyd Garrisons newspaper, The Liberator (1831). That Sinha employs the concept of waves, a term generally reserved for the study of modern feminism, suggests how she links antislavery not only with the womens rights movement but also with movements against every manner of inequality. Similarly, she connects abolition with calls for Native American and immigrant rights, the labor movement, and anti-imperialist campaigns of all kinds.Throughout the long struggle against slavery, Sinha says that with a few exceptions, black people were always a step ahead of their white compatriots in making the case for black freedom. Their antislavery petitions predate the formation of the first (and exclusively white) abolition societies in the 1780s and 1790s, and they were faster to dismiss colonization as a legitimate antislavery plan, to demand immediate, uncompensated emancipation, to aid fugitive slaves in what came to be called the Underground Railroad and finally to promote organized slave rebellions.Perhaps nowhere was the distance between black and white abolitionists greater than on the subject of race itself. Black abolitionists transformed their struggle against slavery into a movement against racial discrimination. As Sinha argues in one of the most original sections of The Slaves Cause, black abolitionists produced the first full-blown analyses of American racism, beginning with a treatise by the Rev. Hosea Easton in 1837.The source of their concern, as Sinha underlines, derived from the pervasive racial discrimination all black people experienced. They were barred from churches, schools, workshops and cemeteries, indeed, any institution white people claimed as their own. Hardly any doors but those of our state prisons, were open to our colored brethren, Garrison remarked. Small wonder, Sinha concludes, that African-Americans led the way when it came to resisting racial discrimination and demanding equality, beginning with the suffrage and the other attributes of citizenship.White abolitionists could not help recognizing the justice of these demands, since they were themselves identified with black people. Garrison noted that black people worked against wind and tide, and white abolitionists joined the assault on inequality. But either from a lack of resources or perhaps a lack of will, they could do little to redress the pervasive discrimination. When anti-abolitionist thugs burned Hosea Eastons church in Hartford, Conn., to the ground in 1836, he spent what would be the last year of his life raising money for a new one. Just about the best that Garrison could do to assist him was to publish Eastons treatise and write a celebratory eulogy in The Liberator after his death.The diverse responses to the pain of discrimination suggest some of the strains within the antislavery movement, and as Sinha shows, the history of abolition, like most reform movements, is often a story of fragmentation and division. Some splits were over matters of religion, and some over Garrisons peculiar perfectionist ethos and notions of nonresistance. Although women were abolitions most effective representatives and the most numerous foot soldiers, sharp differences over their place within the movement persisted. Of course, personality clashes were frequent. Sinha treats these divisions fully and fairly, although she plays down Frederick Douglasss horrendous break with Garrison. Eventually, the two patched up their differences, but the acrimonious split speaks to the racial tensions that roiled the abolitionist movement.Garrisons support within the black community never wavered. Of the first 500 subscribers to The Liberator, 450 were black. James Forten, the wealthy black Philadelphia sailmaker, kept Garrison afloat at critical moments. Garrison himself declared that The Liberator did not belong to whites  They do not sustain it. Rather, people of color made it theirs  It is their organ.Still, as Douglass noted, the relation subsisting between the white and the black people of the country is the vital question of the age, and his observation applied as much to those within the antislavery movement as those outside it. In the short-lived Northern Star and Freemans Advocate, another abolitionist spoke for many when he urged his fellows to help blacks by hiring them and by eradicating prejudice from their own hearts. Many, of course, did. But the racial tensions within the movement remained, perhaps to a degree Sinha seems reluctant to acknowledge.If abolition set a template for American liberation movements, what can modern readers learn from this blockbuster history? In a brief epilogue, Sinha argues for many lessons, at least for those readers on the left, and the mention of names like Du Bois and Debs reflect back on the road she has traveled. Meanwhile, she suggests that Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and President Obama point to the road ahead. She reminds us that Martin Luther King Jr. was so fond of quoting the 19th-century antislavery theologian Theodore Parker on the arc of the moral universe bending toward justice that most people attribute Parkers words to him. But these are only tantalizing suggestions, and Sinha stops short of systematically tracing the links she perceives. Nonetheless, she has given us a full history of the men and women who truly made us free. And that is more than enough."}

{"text": "Deniz Gamze Erguven is a Turkish-French filmmaker whose debut film, Mustang, has been nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign language film.READING Im reading everything I find about the subject of jealousy for a script Im working on. It ranges from classics like Othello and Medea to, right now, a book from Giulia Sissa titled La jalousie, une passion inavouable. Jealousy can make you feel very ashamed, but it can also testify to a very strong, irreplaceable love.LISTENING Every day before starting to write, for every film, I have one song or playlist that puts me in the mood. Its like my tuning fork. For my latest project, it is Nina Simones and David Bowies versions of Wild Is the Wind. The song is about huge falling in love and huge heartbreak.Im also listening to a lot of podcasts of French radio, such as Les nouveaux chemins de la connaissance  its an immersive discussion of philosophy with writers, thinkers and artists. And Boomerang, which has interviews with people in the cultural fields, such as directors, writers, actors and dancers.WATCHING I used to see three to four films in theaters a week, but since I had my own film and a baby this year, I havent had much time to be a cinephile. Past films that have influenced me or moved me the most are Jerzy Skolimowskis Le depart. Its about a boy looking all around Brussels to find a Porsche for a car race. It sounds trivial, but theres such a level of life, of youthfulness and grace.And for me, David Lynchs Mulholland Drive is perfection in terms of all the ideas I have about storytelling. The plotline is layers of dreams, but its a woman who falls in love with another woman who gets her killed. The first part of the film is a very transformed egotistic version of what happened, and then you see what really happened and its much more gloomy.FOLLOWING Can Dundar, the editor in chief of the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was jailed for months and will stand trial for publishing reports critical of the government. I follow everything about him. For me, its as if the editor of The New York Times or Le Monde was jailed. Its a terrible moment we are living in Turkey right now.WEARING After 15 years of checking the time on my cellphone, Im wearing a watch again, the Boyfriend watch by Chanel. I wanted to be less tethered to technology, and a watch was a means of doing that. If you check the time on your phone, then you start interacting with it.DESIGNING I have an embarrassingly nerdy thing I do: I redesign the interior of planes and airports. It feels like travel, which should be an adventure and an opportunity for encounters, has devolved so much toward being cost efficient that something has been lost. I like to imagine redesigning everything from the way people can enter and exit planes to the way they can place themselves or move around inside of them. I know this sounds completely crazy, but its a remnant of my childhood dream of being an architect and a consequence of all the time I spend traveling."}
{"text": "THE anti-gay ideology that has long held sway in American evangelicalism seems to be crumbling. Conservatives insistence that the Bible proscribes homosexual acts and their claim that protecting gay rights infringes on their own religious liberty have depended on another assumption not found in Scripture: that homosexuality is not a biologically rooted identity but a sinful temptation, an addiction that one must control.The noisy backlash against the Supreme Courts legalization of gay marriage cannot mask the signs that this assumption is losing its grip. The most conspicuous indication that something is changing came in 2013 while Obergefell v. Hodges was still working its way up to the court. Alan Chambers, the president of the ex-gay ministry Exodus International, apologized to L.G.B.T. people for causing them pain and hurt and shut down his organization.Exoduss collapse was a media spectacle. It was a huge blow to those who insist that same-sex attraction can be cured, and an encouragement to the growing number of evangelicals, particularly millennials, who support L.G.B.T. rights. But some young Christians resist the notion that embracing queer sexuality as an identity  not a disease  permits them to embrace homosexual relationships.These dissenters proudly call themselves gay or queer or bisexual. But they have turned to ideologies outside the conventional boundaries of evangelicalism  including Catholic theology and queer theory  to argue against both conservatives and liberals. They insist that the church should welcome gay people, yet still condemn homosexual acts. They have provoked a dispute that gets to the heart of the culture wars: a debate over the meaning of vocation that reveals the tension between modern assumptions about living a full life and older ideas about the sacrifices Gods calling requires.Lanira Postell, who attends an evangelical church in Georgia, had relationships with women for years before God transformed not only my sexuality but my life, she told me. I expected her to launch into a testimony of her conversion from same-sex attraction, but thats not what happened. The biggest hurdle I had to jump over was letting go, submitting my full self to the will of God, and in doing that I had to let go of my desire to be straight, she said. Surrendering to God meant rejecting a black and white binary of sexual identity. Im still mentally, emotionally and spiritually attracted to women, she said, and calls herself bisexual with celibate same-sex attraction.Evangelicals  particularly millennials like Ms. Postell, who is 26  have absorbed secular thinkers ideas about the fluidity of sexual expression. This is, in part, a counterintuitive legacy of traditional ex-gay ministries. When groups like Exodus promised that sexual desire could change, they pioneered queer theory in the evangelical world. Participants often acknowledged their struggles with relapse, and their testimonies point to the instability and changeability of their own identities rather than serve as a testament to heterosexuality, the ethnographer Tanya Erzen wrote in her study of ex-gay ministries, Straight to Jesus.Despite coming to terms with her bisexuality, Ms. Postell hopes for heterosexual marriage one day. But for other queer Christians, God demands a life of celibacy. In an era when the right worships the nuclear family and the left celebrates sexual authenticity and gay marriage, celibate gay Christians have no comfortable home on either side of the political spectrum. Theres little space for them even in Christian queer communities, said John Bagley, a board member of OneWheaton, a network of L.G.B.T. alumni and allies of Wheaton College, a conservative evangelical school. Their decision stands as an affront to the decision a lot of people have made.Many celibate gay evangelicals look outside the Protestant tradition and reach into ancient history for help in thinking about loneliness and desire. Wesley Hill, an assistant professor of biblical studies at Trinity School for Ministry in Pennsylvania and a celibate gay Christian, told me he draws inspiration from Catholic thinkers like the Dutch priest Henri Nouwen, who was attracted to men.Dr. Hill left his childhood denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, for the Anglican Communion, which emphasizes its Catholic past and has a monastic tradition. In his most recent book, Spiritual Friendship, he followed in the footsteps of historians like John Boswell, who argued that the medieval church was a surprisingly hospitable place for gay Christians. Dr. Hill has called on evangelicals to resurrect the ancient Christian tradition of honoring some same-sex friendships as a holy covenant. Conservatives have reacted with skepticism. They think it would be a way of smuggling in same-sex erotic attraction, to find an acceptable way of being gay, having a lover, he told me.Sarah and Lindsey, a celibate lesbian couple who dont reveal their last names on their blog A Queer Calling, worshiped in Eastern Orthodox churches for several years. They point to the models that non-Protestant church history offers to Christians who dont fit the hetero-normative mold, like the Beguines, a celibate spiritual movement among Catholic women in medieval Northern Europe. Words like friend and sister dont adequately describe every instance of meaningful relationship between one Beguine woman and another, they write.Those who seek to persuade evangelical churches to embrace gay celibacy face an uphill battle, and not only because Martin Luther wrote that to spurn marriage is to act against Gods calling and against natures urging. The idealized image of the heterosexual nuclear family has become the chief conservative rallying point of the culture wars. Part of why Ive experienced pain is that I grew up in an evangelical church that elevates the family, Dr. Hill told me. Youre told your whole life that its the summit of happiness.BUT does liberals emphasis on gay marriage effectively send the same message? If you end up accepting the progressive position, you then have a future: Gay people, youre supposed to get married, have romance, have children, and thats how you get security and stave off loneliness, said Eve Tushnet, a celibate Catholic lesbian writer who has a growing following among evangelicals. But if you dont change your sexual ethic, then the challenge to your cultural mind-set is very deep because youre no longer able to offer gay people the forms of adult love that our culture recognizes. If the ex-gay ministries ironically introduced evangelicals to more fluid ideas of sexuality, the liberal campaign for gay marriage has reinforced the grip of traditional family values.Like other gay celibate Christians I spoke to, Ms. Tushnet uses the language of vocation to explain why she sticks to a path that denies her the sexual fulfillment that most people consider so fundamental. A vocation is not supposed to be easy. We see in Scripture that God calls people who are uniquely unsuited for the task that he sets them, she told me.The question of vocation is not an intramural theological debate. It reveals the essential source of the culture wars: a breakdown in the American consensus over whose demands we should live to serve, and what it means for humans to flourish.There is a long history here. The German sociologist Max Weber famously argued that the Puritans laid the groundwork. They reinterpreted the biblical concept of vocation as a calling to fulfill ones duty in the world, where a successful career would signal Gods favor. The idea of duty in ones calling prowls about in our lives like the ghost of dead religious beliefs, Weber wrote.But today, even Webers attenuated idea of vocation is an alien notion in a culture that commands us to do what you love and marry for love, a culture that celebrates the satisfaction of sexual desire as a good in and of itself. We often conflate passion and pleasure with duty.The gay Christians I interviewed stick to an older idea of vocation: the call to obey a higher will that is not your own, one that may leave earthly desires ungratified. The idea of loving God above all else, embracing ones identity as a bride of Christ, is fundamental to Christianity. It is woven into medieval monks erotic commentaries on the Song of Songs and saturates the lyrics of modern megachurch music. It is also wholly unintelligible to most secular people  and probably remains elusive even to many Christians. The idea of this higher love, or that you could have a loving relationship directly with the Eucharist, is so remote from most Americans experience of church that its not hard to see why its unbelievable, said Ms. Tushnet, the Catholic writer. Lots of people go through life without ever feeling that internal contact with God in the St. Teresa Bernini sculpture way.In an era when gay marriage is legal and a range of gay Christians are modeling different ways to reconcile sexuality and faith, are the decisions of young believers like Lanira Postell still a result of coercion and confused self-hatred? I asked her what she thought about those liberal critics who might think so. I understand where theyre coming from, that to them what Im doing doesnt make any sense, she said. Thats why being a Christian is not common. Its weird. It is unnatural for me to deny myself what I desire, but I do it because of the love of God."}
{"text": "Last year we set out to make a series of short documentaries that we hoped would foster a discussion about race relations in the United States. To date the series has focused on the personal nuances of systemic racism as reflected in the relationship between blacks and whites. And while that dynamic is a significant part of the American story of race, it does not fully reflect the countrys varied history and rapidly changing demographics. So for our next installment of our Conversation on Race series, we decided to go broader, and hear from Latinos on their experiences here.Fifty-five million Latinos live in this country, representing 17 percent of the population. After Mexico, the United States is home to the worlds largest population of Spanish speakers. Latinos are projected to make up a record 11.9 percent of eligible voters in 2016, just shy of blacks, who are 12.4 percent. We were curious about how race shapes opportunity in a community that draws from such a hugely diverse group of racial backgrounds and ethnicities. How does one identity get forged from such an assortment of experience?Before we could even discuss racism and the challenges Latinos face in this country, though, we had to define the term Latino. When we asked our interviewees, their responses were wide-ranging. For some, Latino identity is a political stance involving both race and nationality, while others found the label deeply constraining. Most pointed to the frustrations of being stereotyped, marginalized and demeaned. The people we spoke with were vulnerable, and their stories illuminating, but most of what we took from them is that we need far more examination of this crucial segment of the American population. We hope you will join us in having these conversations. As a start, we invite you to do so here."}
{"text": "WOODBRIDGE, Va.   On her first day on the job, Officer Ashley Guindon responded to a call that could have become routine had she gone on to a long career in law enforcement: a domestic disturbance in a well-kept suburban neighborhood.But something had already gone terribly wrong inside the Northern Virginia home of Ronald Hamilton, an Army sergeant, the police said Sunday, and Officer Guindons brief time with the Prince William County Police Department came to a horrific end. Sergeant Hamilton fired on Officer Guindon and two of her fellow officers, killing her and leaving the others seriously wounded, Police Chief Stephan Hudson said.Standing next to the countys top elected official and chief prosecutor, Chief Hudson was stone-faced at a news conference on Sunday as he lauded Officer Guindons bravery, intelligence and compassion. The chief offered no details about what might have provoked the gunman, who worked at the Pentagon and, according to neighbors, was about to be transferred to Italy.The fight Saturday afternoon between Sergeant Hamilton, 32, and his wife, Crystal Hamilton, 29, had been going on throughout the day, but it escalated after she called 911, Chief Hudson said. Between her call to the police and the arrival of the officers, Ms. Hamilton was fatally shot by her husband, the chief said, and the three officers were shot just after they arrived at the front door of the couples home.As quickly as the violence began, it was over, Chief Hudson said, with Sergeant Hamilton emerging from his front door to surrender as additional officers arrived. The couples 11-year-old son was home at the time of the slayings and is being cared for by relatives, Chief Hudson said.Officer Guindon, 28, died at a hospital, where the two injured officers  Jesse Hempen, 31, and David McKeown, 33  were being treated on Sunday. The police did not detail their injuries. Chief Hudson said their lives were no longer in danger but they faced long recoveries.Officer Guindon, a former Marine Corps reservist who had a masters degree in forensic science, went through training with the department last year but left for personal reasons, Chief Hudson said. She rejoined the department this year and was sworn in on Friday, which the department marked with a celebratory tweet.We were struck by her passion to do this job, Chief Hudson said. She did share with us when we rehired her that she felt like she wanted to do this job. She couldnt get it out of her blood. She clearly had a passion to serve others in a way that went beyond herself.Her death on duty was the fourth in the 46-year history of the department, and only the second time a county officer was killed maliciously, county officials said. The county has 446,000 residents, and Woodbridge is one of many bedroom communities popular with federal workers, the military and others who commute to Washington, 30 miles to the north.This department is revered. Its respected, said Corey Stewart, the chairman of the countys Board of Supervisors. She was an example of the kind of person that the department hires and the quality of the men and women who work for the department.The countys longtime chief prosecutor, Commonwealths Attorney Paul Ebert, said he would probably seek the death penalty against Sergeant Hamilton, who was being held without bond on charges including capital murder, first-degree murder and malicious wounding. Sergeant Hamilton was scheduled to be arraigned Monday.Officer Guindons death was not the first tragedy to strike her family. Her father, David, killed himself in 2014 the day after he returned home from Iraq, where he served with the New Hampshire Air National Guard. He was buried with full military honors."}

{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how daily news, features and opinion pieces come together at The New York Times. Today, Craig Allen, a photo editor, describes the process behind The Timess photographic coverage of the Academy Awards.As a picture editor who spends most of my time on the international desk, my work tends to involve some very sobering issues  war, disease, political instability.But once a year, for a week or so, I come to Hollywood to coordinate The Timess photo coverage of the Academy Awards. Besides the obvious benefit of temporarily trading New Yorks dreary February weather for that of warm and sunny Southern California, I also enjoy getting a little out of my comfort zone to work on the entertainment calendars biggest night of the year.The Times usually has three photographers covering the Oscars. In recent years, the team has consisted of Noel West, who covers red carpet arrivals and the Governors Ball, one of the main after parties; Patrick T. Fallon, who covers the awards ceremony from inside the Dolby Theatre; and Monica Almeida, our Los Angelesbased staff photographer who roams the red carpet and shoots the ceremony from backstage, a position afforded to only a handful of news organizations.My job at the Oscars is to build the fiber-optic network that connects our camera positions at the ceremony to a nearby workroom that receives every picture our photographers take. From there, the photos are compressed and sent back to The Timess office in New York, where a team of editors select, caption and publish  in as close to real time as possible  our teams best photographs.Because of our innovative technological arrangements (which were originally conceived by Josh Haner, who leads technology development for the photo department), and because of our position near the beginning of the red carpet, The Times is often able to publish photographs of celebrities even before they appear on live television.The team here in Los Angeles spends the week before the Academy Awards setting up and testing our equipment  and then testing it again and again. We consider the angles, the light, the weather; we plan for myriad contingencies by carrying backups for every piece of hardware. In short, we do everything we can to position ourselves to capture the most glamorous looks on the carpet and every crucial moment of the show.We also spend the week lining up our clothes for the evening. (Because of our proximity to the guests, all journalists are required to don formal wear: either a tuxedo or a formal-length gown. The Academy reserves the right to turn away anyone whose dress does not meet its standards.)On Oscar day, we run a final round of tests on our gear and our transmission lines. Later, all of the journalists are removed from the theater for a massive security sweep, returning just before the first celebrities arrive on the red carpet.Noel photographs the stars on the red carpet from a chaotic on-site press pen thats remarkably hot and loud. (He likens the experience to that of a canned sardine trying to take pictures.) At the same time, Monica  who is one of the few news photographers allowed onto the red carpet  wanders among the celebrities, capturing up-close and candid moments. As the show begins, Patrick takes his position at the back of the theater; Monica moves backstage to cover the show from the side of the stage and capture moments you wont see on television.While all of this is happening, I monitor our operation and troubleshoot any issues that may arise, then edit and build a slide show for the Governors Ball. Its a long night that caps off a long week. After staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning, I hop on a flight to New York around 11 a.m. and am back on the international desk the next morning.This year we shot and transmitted 10,000 photographs. One in particular  of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet  has already generated 230,000 likes on Facebook and over 1,200 retweets.But it isnt just about the numbers. We also edited and published our photos more quickly than just about any other news organization.Im already thinking about how we might do things better  and faster  next year."}
{"text": "A raucous Republican race could gain clarity this week, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont could face a dwindling opportunity to prove he can develop support beyond his coalition of younger, whiter voters, as the parallel primaries head into Super Tuesday.With roughly a dozen nominating contests in both primaries, the Republican votes present an opportunity for Donald J. Trump to amass a plurality of the 595 delegates available, and to put that much more distance between him and Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Cruz is fighting to win his home state of Texas, which votes on Tuesday, while Mr. Rubio is looking to increase his vote totals in congressional districts and to bolster his delegate count.But it also appears that those in the Republican Party who do not back Mr. Trump are realizing that he could be their problem through the fall. And in the last two days, Mr. Trump has given his opponents a lot of ammunition  by initially refusing to disavow support from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who has praised Mr. Trumps ascent in the primaries, and by retweeting a famous quote from Mussolini.Mr. Trump has proved Teflon-like in the campaign so far. But he is now facing the first sustained attacks in the form of television advertisements, and he is doing little to counter them with his own spending. And Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz are unloading their opposition research files, including mentions that Mr. Trump avoided the military draft as a younger man and that some news accounts have claimed his businesses had reported ties to organized crime. But the biggest charge that Mr. Rubio hopes will stick is the one in which he has called Mr. Trump a con man over and over. With lesser schoolyard taunts, like discussing the size of Mr. Trumps fingers, he is trying to get in the real estate billionaires head.As for the Democrats, Mr. Sanders is looking to rebound after a deeply lopsided loss to Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina primary, where more than half the voters were African-American. Mrs. Clinton overwhelmingly won black voters. And while it is hard to translate the results from one state to others, Mr. Sanders had a number of paid staff members in South Carolina and worked hard  raising questions about where he will next find success."}
{"text": "LONDON   When Zinedine Zidane was a player, he could raise his game like few other men to breach almost any defense. As a coach, he no longer has that power.And in his own stadium, with a team of players as expensive as any on earth, the futility of that predicament clearly tortures him. Zidane railed to no effect as Real Madrid lost, 1-0, on Saturday to Atltico Madrid in their derby match.Zidanes problem was that he no longer wears the white jersey of Real Madrid during games, but instead a heavy black overcoat as the coach. Zidane exhorted and shouted to his players from the sideline, but his instructions fell on deaf ears. As he waved his arms and clenched his fists, sections of Santiago Bernabu Stadium waved white handkerchiefs and called for Real Madrids president, Florentino Prez, to resign.This humiliating act is becoming a ritual in the Bernabu. This is the third straight year that Atltico, the supposedly upstart neighbor, has won in Reals stadium. On Saturday, as before, Atlticos steely and superbly organized defense squeezed out Reals superstars, the so-called Galcticos.Afterward, Zidane insisted that his team had given up on nothing and that it would pursue the titles in La Liga and the Champions League to the end. His players, though, were less defiant.Sergio Ramos, the captain, said the championship is practically out of our reach. Cristiano Ronaldo admitted the teams chances are gone now. Barcelona is out of sight in the Spanish league, and even Atltico is four points ahead of Real.There were bitter edges to some of what Ronaldo appeared to say about a lack of quality among his teammates, but he later tried to smooth those comments and explain that he was referring to the lack of available players due to injuries.Across the corridor, on the Atltico side of this drama, Coach Diego Simeone was once again running through the names and positive traits of the players in his lineup. Both sides could agree on a number of things. That Atltico achieved more with less-expensive talent. That it got more results out of fewer possessions. And that Atltico was more prepared, despite having less time to get ready  Real had a full week to prepare, while Atltico had only a few days after playing P.S.V. Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday night.The problem wasnt fitness, Zidane told reporters. The game today was more mental. They played on Wednesday and did not have much time to recover  and look at the game they played.There spoke a man of experience. Im always going to be behind the players, and they are behind me, Zidane said. Im going to look for a solution, but I cant be happy, and the players cannot be happy.Next year we may have to change, he said. There could be a change of manager, too.In that last reflection, he touched upon the instability of Real Madrid under Prez, who is in his second stint as president. Prez had resigned 10 years ago to the day Saturday after his Galcticos fell behind Barcelona in the league, just as they are doing again now.On Saturday, the stars who worked hardest were largely in Atlticos red and white. Antoine Griezmann, a once-mercurial winger who now buys into Simeones demanding work ethic, scored the only goal, shortly after halftime.Even Griezmann seemed surprised at the space that opened up in front of him. He ran at a retreating Real defense, right down the center. Griezmann passed the ball out wide to his left, received it back from Filipe Lus, and calmly side-footed his low shot between goalkeeper Keylor Navas and a post.Before and after that, the home club had more possession. The away team defended in heavy numbers, but it seldom displayed any impending sense of fear. Ronaldo  now 31 and not quite the Ronaldo he once was  had his chances, but he fired either at the keeper or over the bar. And the more forlorn the superstar looked, the more Atlticos defenders, Diego Godn and Juanfran, would help their younger colleagues in defense.In 26 Liga games this season, Real has scored 71 goals, more than Barcelona. In 26 games, Atltico has conceded just 11 goals, fewer than any other top club in Europe.And to those, like Chelsea, who have pondered whether Simeone could do a similar job for their team without being so defense-oriented, it would be fair to note that Atltico spends only about one-third as much as Real, Chelsea and others do on players.The Atltico way was personified before halftime, when Griezmann lost the ball on the halfway line, and his only instinct was to run back 40 yards and try to take the ball from Isco, the Real player who had stolen it from him.That is engrained in all Atltico players, be they the star striker or someone else. The essence of it entails chasing down every ball and harassing every opponent as Atltico tries to find the breaking points.Ronaldo sounded close to that when he said, We spoke in the changing room, but it stays there. Zidane cant play, but in my opinion hes doing a phenomenal job. Hes a very calm person, very optimistic, and hes making us better. You have to give him time and leave him alone.Ronaldo had spoken hastily about teammates not being on his level. He later explained: I was referring to my fitness level, not level of play. When you dont have players like Bale, Pepe, Benzema or Marcelo, its not easy to win a competition. I am no better than my teammates.The Champions League, he said, excites him, but Reals chances of winning the Spanish league are done."}

So  officially, anyway  his birthday is a quadrennial thing, like presidential elections and the Summer Olympics.I always treated it like it was a special birthday because you had to wait four years to get it, Mr. Sabato said over lunch on a recent afternoon. This was after a television appearance that drew a crowd on the sidewalk outside the studio after he posted on Twitter where he would be. People in the crowd remembered him from his roles on soap operas like General Hospital and The Bold and the Beautiful and his guest appearances on shows like Castle and Hot in Cleveland.Mr. Sabato was wearing outerwear as well as, presumably, underwear  some questions went unasked at the lunch. But yes, he said, the shirt, the tie and the pinstripe suit were all Calvin Klein.Now, about the birthday, please.

Lucky that he was born when he was, in 1972, and that he was not a leap-year baby from, say, 1872 or 2072.A hundred years earlier or a hundred years later, Dr. Tyson said, and Mr. Sabato would have celebrated only five birthdays by the time he unveiled the billboard, not six, and only 10 including this one, not 11. (An explanation will follow, but first, an irresistible question: When was the last time a former underwear model and a world-famous astrophysicist were mentioned in the same paragraph?)Dr. Tyson warned that he was about to descend into the depths of the Gregorian calendar. But he began by saying that calling Feb. 29 a leap day was misleading.Were not leaping into anything, he said. Its a catch-up day. The calendar owes us a day.That extra day every four years is a correction, he said. It takes 365 days for the Earth to go around the sun, so a 365-day year shortchanges reality. The additional day in years divisible by four is supposed to set things right.And it does, if you dont carry your calculations out to several decimal places.If you do, it turns out that the one-year orbit actually takes about 365.2421 days, a bit less than 365.25.Its an underappreciated fact of the world, Dr. Tyson said, and it causes what he referred to as the accumulating problem. Those fractional bits of a day add up, he said, noting, Every century, you overaccumulate by one day.Under the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 and named for Pope Gregory XIII, one day is dropped every 100 years. But even that is too much, so the authorities agreed not to drop a day in century years divisible by 400, Dr. Tyson said. That is why there was no Feb. 29 in 1900 and why there will not be a Feb. 29 in 2100  but why there was indeed a Feb. 29, 2000, when Mr. Sabato turned 7.But, Dr. Tyson said, something was not quite right about that last sentence.He was seven birthdays old, he said. He wasnt 7 years old. Hed had seven birthdays.But that was not right, either. By 2000, Mr. Sabato had blown out as many candles as anyone else born in 1972, because he usually celebrated on March 1 in the off years. His maternal grandfather was also born on Feb. 29. What are the chances of that? I would say lottery-ticket odds, one in a million, Dr. Tyson said.When he was a young actor hoping to make a living off his looks, Mr. Sabato would walk through Times Square and imagine himself on a billboard. Now he remembers the Times Square of old, with prostitutes and drug dealers.The smell was extremely bad, he said. Sewer.Mr. Sabato lived on West 45th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues.I didnt see crime, he said, but I heard it outside my window every night.And then it happened. The call came. Calvin Klein saw a movie I did, he said. I flew out right away, of course. I didnt know quite what the meeting was about. I tried on a pair of underwear.The photographer was to be Wayne Maser, a magazine and fashion virtuoso who had photographed everyone from Drew Barrymore for Guess jeans to John Cougar Mellencamp for his album covers.Mr. Sabato fretted. Do I have to shave my legs? he recalled. They sent me to a wax place. So much pain, I never did it again. A Polish lady. It wont hurt. The first time she pulled a little piece off my leg, I screamed like a baby, and it didnt get any better.He remembered pulling the cord that, um, exposed the billboard.It was surreal, he said. Reporters went back to their newsrooms and tried to describe what they had seen. The headline on one article read, A Michelangelo in Bikini Briefs.After the unveiling, Mr. Sabato went to Macys, where 1,500 people were waiting. He signed their underwear  or the packages the underwear came in. Herbert Muschamp, a critic for The New York Times, trailed along, expecting that the mood would be carnivalesque. It was not, he wrote: There were no leers, no smirks. This decorous group could have been standing in line at a church supper.Walking through Times Square last month, Mr. Sabato sounded astonished  not by how different the landscape is now but that there was no social media in those days, no photograph to tweet or to post. Not back then, when he was only 6.You had to come here and see it for yourself, he said."}
{"text": "Stephen Curry heard the criticism last week  that his success was due in part to a lack of legitimate perimeter defense in the N.B.A., that todays stars do not play tough enough to stop him.To put it bluntly, no defense in history could have stopped Curry at the end of the Golden State Warriors game at Oklahoma City on Saturday night.The score was tied, 118-118, when Golden States Andre Iguodala pulled down a rebound off a missed jumper by the Thunders Russell Westbrook with about six seconds remaining in overtime. The Warriors could have called a timeout to set up their offense, but Iguodala instead tossed the ball to Curry, who casually made his way across midcourt. Before the Thunder could put together anything resembling a defense against him, Curry launched the ball toward the hoop from more than 32 feet out.Swish. In addition to beating the rival Thunder, Curry tied the record for the most 3-pointers in a game (12) and broke his own record for most in a season (he has 288 with 24 games to play).What was that, 40 feet? Golden States Draymond Green asked reporters after the game. Thats absurd.To put the shot into perspective, consider that the 3-point arc is approximately 23 feet 9 inches from the basket. By launching the ball so quickly, Curry took the shot well before Andre Roberson, a stout defender for the Thunder, could get back to defend him.Curry finished with 46 points and in his last four games has averaged 43.8 points a game while shooting 61.1 percent from 3-point range, a rate that was actually better than the 60.8 percent he had shot from the field over all.For the season, Curry is leading the N.B.A. in scoring at 30.7 points a game, and he appears to be a lock to be the eighth player in N.B.A. history to complete a so-called 50-40-90 season  shooting 50 percent or better from the field, 40 percent or better from 3-point range and 90 percent or better from the free-throw line.The best in the N.B.A. have given Curry, the N.B.A.s reigning most valuable player, his due:With all the praise has come the expected criticism. Some veterans of previous eras have jabbed at Curry in an apparent attempt to justify how the game was superior when they played.Oscar Robertson, a Hall of Famer best known for averaging a triple-double for the Cincinnati Royals in the 1961-62 season, seems intent on writing off Currys success as a product of bad defense rather than superior marksmanship.When I played years ago, if you shot a shot outside and hit it, the next time Im going to be up on top of you, Robertson said on Mike & Mike, an ESPN radio show, on Thursday. Im going to pressure you with three-quarters, half-court defense. But now they dont do that. These coaches do not understand the game of basketball, as far as Im concerned.Many former players rushed to agree with Robertson that Currys success was a result of the deficiencies of his era and that their success was somehow more pure.Surprisingly, one of the most reasonable viewpoints has come from Isiah Thomas, a Hall of Fame guard for the Detroit Pistons who, with a checkered history as a league executive, has often had his credibility questioned.Thomas supported Robertsons assertion that a dearth of perimeter defense was a huge flaw in todays game, but unlike Robertson and many other critics, Thomas acknowledged that Curry could truly be judged only in the context of his era because there is no way to know how his talent would translate to earlier incarnations of the game.The game has changed, Thomas said on Mike & Mike on Friday. You cant really apply the rules of my era to this one. We have to appreciate what Steph is doing under the rules hes playing under, and hes the best player under the circumstances.While Coach Steve Kerr has been vocal in defending Curry, poking fun at the former stars who have chosen to criticize him, perhaps the best defense came from Andrew Bogut, Golden States lumbering center, who mocked the old-timers on Twitter.Still, for Curry, who has called the criticism annoying, the best response was to take a shot that was indefensible both in the sense that no one should have taken it and in the sense that no one could have stopped it.When the shot went in, Curry smiled and danced, just like Cam Newton, the star quarterback of Currys beloved Carolina Panthers. And like Newton, he did not seem to care if the old-timers found the whole thing off-putting."}
{"text": "Given recent history, the next president can expect to face an even more unpredictable world than the one President Obama is dealing with. Russia, China, Syria, Iran, North Korea, the Islamic State  the list of security challenges is daunting. It will require smart policy choices backed by a powerful military to protect American interests.So far, the candidates have not sufficiently explained their approaches to military spending which, at $580 billion for 2016, is half of the federal discretionary budget. The toughest talk comes from the Republicans who lean dangerously toward a one-dimensional view of American strength that is over-reliant on an all-powerful military.I will make our military so big, powerful and strong that no one will mess with us, Donald Trump says.  But what does that mean? This is the guy who extolled the power of nuclear deterrence in a recent debate, but didnt know it relies on three types of forces  missiles, planes and submarines.Like his rivals for the partys nomination  Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich  Mr. Trump supports lifting the caps on the defense budget. Some of the candidates act as if these fiscal restraints were imposed by Mr. Obama, when in fact they resulted from a 2011 compromise between the White House and the Republican-led Congress. The caps are overly restrictive, but they have helped rein in out-of-control military spending.Mr. Rubio wants to restore military strength by building more ships and submarines, reversing troop cuts and expanding missile defenses. That would cost an additional $1 trillion over the next 10 years, Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at the Cato Institute, estimates. Although Mr. Cruz is eager to shrink the rest of the government, his plans to salvage a shockingly undermanned and ill-prepared fighting force would increase military spending by $2.5 trillion over eight years, Mr. Friedman says. Mr. Kasich would also raise military spending, but more slowly than Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz.Giving the Pentagon a blank check does not ensure security. It got most of what it wanted in the decade after 9/11, yet America still struggles to keep Afghanistan and Iraq from falling to insurgents.The Republican candidates mislead the public when they say the military is hollowed out; it is the worlds most advanced fighting force, with a larger budget than the next seven countries combined. Still, the endless wars have taken a toll on troops and weapons. There is also a budget crisis coming, because many of the new systems under development will reach their peak funding years in the 2020s.Before any infusion of new funds, the Pentagon, which has wasted billions of dollars on misguided programs, needs to prove it can be a better steward. Congress needs to reform the military health care program, whose costs are spiraling out of control. One place to save: Scale back the planned $1 trillion, 30-year modernization of a nuclear arsenal that will never be used and spend the money on conventional weapons that are needed to fight the Islamic State and other threats. Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, unlike the Republican candidates, have said they are open to this.Mrs. Clinton has advocated the idea of smart power, which relies on a range of tools, diplomatic as well as military, to keep the nation safe. She has said she would name a commission to study military spending. Mr. Sanders wants a robust military but opposes spending increases.America needs a strong and technologically advanced military, but politically driven excessive investment in the Pentagon has too often meant short shrift for the State Department and its diplomatic missions, as well as cuts in domestic programs that hurt the most vulnerable citizens. It is crucial for the next president to get that balance right."}
{"text": "[ 2016 Oscar winners | reviewing Chris Rock | what happened in the show | red carpet looks ]The following was transcribed from the ABC broadcast of the 88th Academy Awards, and is not an official copy of the speech.CHRIS ROCK: Man, I counted at least 15 black people on that montage. Im here at the Academy Awards, otherwise known as the White Peoples Choice Awards.You realize if they nominated hosts, I wouldnt even get this job. So yall would be watching Neil Patrick Harris right now.But this is the wildest, craziest Oscars to ever host, because weve got all this controversy. No, no black nominees, you know, and people are like Chris, you should boycott. Chris, you should quit. You should quit.How come theres only unemployed people that tell you to quit something, you know? No one with a job ever tells you to quit.So, I thought about quitting. I thought about it real hard. But, I realized, theyre gonna have the Oscars anyway. Theyre not gonna cancel the Oscars because I quit. You know? And the last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart, O.K.?I dont need that. Kev right there  Kev makes movies fast. Every month. Porno stars dont make movies that fast.Now the thing is, Why are we protesting? The big question: Why this Oscars? Why this Oscars, you know?Its the 88th Academy Awards. Its the 88th Academy Awards, which means this whole no black nominees thing has happened at least 71 other times. O.K.?You gotta figure that it happened in the 50s, in the 60s  you know, in the 60s, one of those years Sidney didnt put out a movie. Im sure there were no black nominees some of those years. Say 62 or 63, and black people did not protest.Why? Because we had real things to protest at the time, you know? We had real things to protest; you know, were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer.You know, when your grandmothers swinging from a tree, its really hard to care about best documentary foreign short.But what happened this year? What happened? People went mad. Spike got mad,  got mad, and Jada went mad, and Will went mad. Everybody went mad, you know?Jada got mad? Jada says she not coming, protesting. Im like aint she on a TV show?Jada is going to boycott the Oscars  Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihannas panties. I wasnt invited.Oh, thats not an invitation I would turn down.But I understand, Im not hating. I understand you mad. Jadas mad her man Will was not nominated for Concussion. I get it, I get it.Tell the truth. I get it, I get it. You get mad  its not fair that Will was this good and didnt get nominated.Yeah, youre right. Its also not fair that Will was paid $20 million for Wild Wild West. O.K.?Thing, you know, this year, the Oscars, things are gonna be a little different. Things are going to be a little different at the Oscars. This year, in the In Memoriam package, its just going to be black people that were shot by the cops on their way to the movies.Yes, yes. I said it. Alright?Hey, if you want black nominees every year, you need to just have black categories. Thats what you need. You need to have black categories.You already do it with men and women. Think about it: Theres no real reason for there to be a man and a woman category in acting.Cmon. Theres no reason. Its not track and field.You dont have to separate em. You know, Robert De Niros never said, I better slow this acting down, so Meryl Streep can catch up.No, not at all, man. If you want black people every year at the Oscars, just have black categories like Best Black Friend.Thats right. And the winner for the 18th year in a row is Wanda Sykes. This is Wandas 18th Black Oscar.But heres the real question. The real question everybody wants to know, everybody wants to know in the world is: Is Hollywood racist? Is Hollywood racist?You know, thats a...you gotta go at that at the right way.Is it burning-cross racist? No.Is it fetch-me-some-lemonade racist? No. No, no, no.Its a different type of racist. Now, I remember one night I was at a fund-raiser for President Obama. A lot of you were there. And, you know, its me and all of Hollywood.And its all of us there. And its about four black people there: me, uh, lets see, Quincy Jones, Russell Simmons, Questlove. You know, the usual suspects, right? And every black actor that wasnt working.Needless, to say Kev Hart was not there. O.K.? So, at some point you get to take a picture with the president, and, you know as theyre setting up the picture you get a little moment with the president.Im like, Mr. President, you see all these writers and producers and actors? They dont hire black people, and theyre the nicest, white people on earth! Theyre liberals! Cheese!Thats right. Is Hollywood racist? Youre damn right Hollywood is racist. But it aint that racist that youve grown accustomed to.Hollywood is sorority racist.Its like, We like you Rhonda, but youre not a Kappa.Thats how Hollywood is.But things are changing. Things are changing.We got a black Rocky this year. Some people call it Creed. I call it Black Rocky.And thats a big, thats an unbelievable statement. I mean, cause Rocky takes place in a world where white athletes are as good as black athletes.Rocky is a science fiction movie. Theres things that happened in Star Wars that are more believable than things that happened in Rocky, O.K.?But hey, were here to honor actors. Were here to honor actors, were here to honor films.Theres a lot of snubs, lot of snubs. One of the biggest snubs no ones talking about: My favorite actor in the world is Paul Giamatti.Paul Giamatti, I believe, is the greatest actor in the world. Think about what Paul Giamatti has done the last couple of years.Last year, hes in 12 Years a Slave  hates black people. This year hes in Straight Outta Compton  loves black people.Last year, he was whooping Lupita; this year, hes crying at Eazy-Es funeral.Now, thats range. Ben Affleck cant do that.What Im trying to say is, you know, its not about boycotting anything. Its just, we want opportunity. We want black actors to get the same opportunities as white actors.Thats it. Not just once. Leo gets a great part every year and, you know, everybody, all you guys, get great parts all the time.But what about the black actors?Look at Jamie Foxx. Jamie Foxx is one of the best actors in the world, man. Jamie Foxx was so good in Ray that they went to the hospital and unplugged the real Ray Charles. Its like, We dont need two of these! Nah, man.You know, everythings not about race, man. Another big thing tonight is  somebody told me this  youre not allowed to ask women what theyre wearing anymore.Theres this whole thing, Ask her more. You have to ask her more. You know its like, You ask the men more.Everythings not sexism, everythings not racism.They ask the men more because the men are all wearing the same outfits, O.K.? Every guy in there is wearing the exact same thing.You know, if George Clooney showed up with a lime green tux on, and a swan coming out his ass, somebody would go, What you wearing, George?Hey, welcome to the 88th Oscars, Academy Awards. Yes, thank you.You want diversity? We got diversity.Please welcome Emily Blunt and somebody whiter, Charlize Theron."}
{"text": "It feels like people clumped themselves into intellectual movements more 30 years ago than they do today. There were paleoconservatives and neoconservatives. There were modernists and postmodernists; liberals, realists, and neoliberals; communitarians and liberation theologians; Jungians and Freudians; Straussians and deconstructionists; feminists and post-feminists; Marxists and democratic socialists. Maybe there were even some transcendentalists, existentialists, pragmatists, agrarians and Gnostics floating around.Now people seem less likely to gather in intellectual clumps. Now public thinkers seem to be defined more by their academic discipline (economist or evolutionary biologist) or by their topic (race and gender), than by their philosophic school or a shared vision for transforming society.The forces of individualism that are sweeping through so much of society are also leading to the atomization of intellectual life. Eighty years ago engaged students at City College in New York sat in the cafeteria hour upon hour, debating. The Trotskyites sat in one alcove and the Leninists sat in another, and since the Trostkyites were smarter and won the debates, the leaders of the Leninist faction eventually forbade their cadres from ever talking to them.But today we live in a start-up culture. Theres great prestige in being the founder of something, the lone entrepreneur who creates something new. Young people who frequently say they dont want to work in some large organization are certainly not going to want to subsume themselves in some pre-existing intellectual label.The Internet has changed things, too. Writers used to cluster around magazines that were the hubs of movements. On the Internet, individual posters and tweeters are more distinct, but collectives of thinkers are less common.The odd thing is that it was easier to come to maturity when there were more well-defined philosophical groups. When there was a choice of self-conscious social movements, a young person could try them on like clothing at the mall: be an existentialist one year and then join a Frankfurt School clique the next. This was a structured way to find a philosophy of life, a way of looking at the world, an identity.Eventually you found what fit, made a wager, joined a team and assented to a belief system that was already latent within you. When I joined National Review at age 24 I joined a very self-conscious tradition. I was connected to a history of insight and belief; to Edmund Burke and Whittaker Chambers and James Burnham. I wanted to learn everything I could about that tradition  what I accepted and what I rejected  as a way to figure out what I believed.When you join a movement  whether it is deconstructionist, feminist or Jungian  you join a community, which can sometimes feel like family in ways good and bad. You have a common way of seeing the world, which you want to share with everyone. When you join, people are always pressing books into your hands.Believing becomes an activity. People in movements take stands, mobilize for common causes, hold conferences, fight and factionalize and build solidarity. (I remember late night at one conference dancing near four generations of anti-communists.)There are opportunity structures for young people to rise and contribute. First you set out the chairs for the meetings; later you get to lead the meetings. Young people find that none of the mentors is perfect, so they cant be completely loyal to any particular leader, but they can be loyal to the enterprise as a whole, because it embodies some real truth and is stumbling toward some real good.The whole process arouses the passions. Today universities teach critical thinking  to be detached, skeptical and analytic. Movements are marked by emotion  division and solidarity, victory and defeat.There are fervent new converts, and traitors who break ranks. There are furious debates over strategy; the future design of society is at stake. There are inevitably love affairs and breakups. People learn ardently, with their hearts.As in any love, theres an idealistic early phase, then a period of disillusionment, and then, hopefully, a period of longer and more stable commitment to the ideas. The movement shapes ones inner landscape. It offers a way to clarify the world; a bunch of books to consult if you need to think through some problem.Of course there is often rigidity and groupthink, but people can also be smarter when thinking in groups. For example, movements pool imagination. Its very hard to come up with a vision so compelling that it can provide a unifying purpose to your life. But such visions emerge in a movement collectively, and then get crystallized by a leader like Martin Luther King.It all depends on taking steps that are less in fashion today: committing to a collective, accepting a label, keeping faith, surrendering self to a tradition that stretches beyond you in time."}
{"text": "Amid generally positive reviews of his jabs at Hollywood and #OscarsSoWhite, the host of Sundays Oscar ceremony, Chris Rock, is being taken to task for some of his material involving Asian-Americans.Introducing the accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tabulates the vote results, Mr. Rock instead brought onstage two boys and a girl of Asian heritage, whom he named Ming Zu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz. As they clutched briefcases, they visually illustrated the stereotype that Asians are diligent workers who excel at math.If anybodys upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids, Mr. Rock added, a punch line interpreted as a reference to child labor in Asia.But that seeming awareness of how fine the line was between satire and slur, only added insult to injury, Lowen Liu wrote on the Slate site. Even if the second beat tries to turn things around, it still allows the teller to make an Asian joke and then excuse himself from the telling. He pulls the rug out from under the audience only to hide underneath it. (Sacha Baron Cohen, in character as Ali G, later also made a swipe  involving Minions and little yellow people  that many found offensive.)Constance Wu, the Fresh Off the Boat actress, tweeted her disappointment: To parade little kids on stage w/no speaking lines merely to be the butt of a racist joke is reductive & gross, she wrote.So did the actor Jeffrey Wright, who tweeted that the joke needed recalibrating, among other more stringent comments.In a new study, the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found that at least half of the movies, television and streaming series released over the last two years had no speaking or named Asian-American characters; when they are represented, it is rarely in leading roles.Even well-known Asian-American actors like Ken Jeong are still asked to do stereotypical accents, as he and others detailed in a recent New York Times story. Its getting a little bit better, but its just not great, Mr. Jeong said of onscreen representation. We have a ways to go.Asian and Asian-American performers, like the South Korean actor Lee Byung-hun and the TV star Mindy Kaling, were on hand as Oscar presenters or prominent guests on Sunday. And the academy president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, called on her colleagues to take action because our audiences are global and rich in diversity, and every facet of our industry should be as well. But many critics said Mr. Rocks jokes seemed like a missed opportunity to highlight the fact that inclusion goes beyond black and white. (There were no jokes aimed at Latinos, but there was also no indication by the awards show that they were proportionately missing from the big screen, though the statistics say they are.)The actor Daniel Dae Kim tweeted that the first reference to any ethnicity other than black took 30 minutes, when someone mentions pho. I thought #diversity was more than that.As the writer Mina Kimes noted on Twitter, the joke  wouldve stung less if there were more Asians on stage tonight.In response to the ceremony, the writer Jaya Sundaresh created her own social media movement, urging followers to use #onlyonepercent to reflect the fact that Asian Americans have recd only 1% of Oscar noms in its history.An antidote to the one-liners came from the Pakistani journalist and filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, who picked up her second Oscar for documentary short, this time for A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness, a film about an 18-year-old girl who survived an attempted honor killing, only to see her attackers set free.The Pakistani prime minister said he would change the law on honor killings after watching her film, Ms. Obaid Chinoy said in her acceptance speech. Thats the power of film."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The federal Medicare program and private health insurers waste nearly $3 billion every year buying cancer medicines that are thrown out because many drug makers distribute the drugs only in vials that hold too much for most patients, a group of cancer researchers has found.The expensive drugs are usually injected by nurses working in doctors offices and hospitals who carefully measure the amount needed for a particular patient and then, because of safety concerns, discard the rest.If drug makers distributed vials containing smaller quantities, nurses could pick the right volume for a patient and minimize waste. Instead, many drug makers exclusively sell one-size-fits-all vials, ensuring that many smaller patients pay thousands of dollars for medicine they are never given, according to researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who published a study on Tuesday in BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal.Some of these medicines are distributed in smaller vial sizes in Europe, where governments play a more active role than the United States does in drug pricing and distribution.Drug companies are quietly making billions forcing little old ladies to buy enough medicine to treat football players, and regulators have completely missed it, said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering and a co-author of the study. If were ever going to start saving money in health care, this is an obvious place to cut.The researchers analyzed the waste generated by the top 20 selling cancer medicines and concluded that insurers paid drug makers $1.8 billion annually on discarded quantities and then spent about $1 billion on markups to doctors and hospitals.Some non-cancer drugs also generate considerable waste, including Remicade, an arthritis drug sold by Johnson & Johnson for which an estimated $500 million of the drugs $4.3 billion in annual sales comes from quantities that are thrown away, researchers found. But such non-cancer drugs were not included in the studys estimates of total waste.In one example, the study said that in the United States Takeda Pharmaceuticals sells Velcade, a drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphoma, only in 3.5-milligram vials that sell for $1,034 and hold enough medicine to treat a person who is 6 feet 6 inches tall and who weighs 250 pounds. If a patient is smaller, then a quantity of the precious powder is thrown away.Lena Haddad, 53, of Germantown, Md., who has been living with multiple myeloma for four years, now gets a weekly dose of 1.8 milligrams of Velcade. On a recent day at Ms. Haddads doctors office in Bethesda, Md., a nurse, Patricia Traylor, took a vial of Velcade from a large drug cabinet. She injected a syringeful of saline into the vial and shook it, pushed a needle into the vial and withdrew about half the contents. Then she threw out the vial with the remaining medicine.You cant use the remainder for the patient the next time she comes in or use it on another patient, so it has to be discarded as waste, Ms. Traylor said.Safety standards permit nurses to use drug leftovers in other patients only if used within six hours and only in specialized pharmacies.Told that she was using only about half of the drug that was purchased, Ms. Haddad said she was shocked.No wonder my premiums keep going up, she said.Medicare and many private insurers charge patients drug co-payments of as much as 20 percent, which can add up to tens of thousands of dollars annually for the latest drugs; much is spent on cancer medicines that patients never receive, according to the study.Dr. Dixie-Lee Esseltine, vice president for oncology clinical research at Takeda, wrote in an email that the pharmaceutical firm worked closely with the F.D.A. to establish the Velcade vial size of 3.5 mg to ensure that one vial of Velcade would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size.Velcade is sold in Britain in both 1-milligram and 3.5-milligram vials.Takeda is expected to earn $309 million this year on supplies of Velcade that are discarded, an amount that represents 30 percent of the drugs overall sales in the United States, the cancer researchers estimated. If Takeda provided an additional vial size of 0.25 milligram, waste would be slashed by 84 percent, also reducing Velcades sales in the United States by $261 million annually, the researchers calculated.You have these incredibly expensive drugs, and you can only buy them in bulk, said Dr. Leonard Saltz, who leads the pharmacy and therapeutics committee at Memorial Sloan Kettering and was a co-author of the study. Whats really interesting is theyre selling these drugs in smaller vials in Europe, where regulators are clearly paying attention to this issue.Christopher Kelly, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency objected to companies proposed vial sizes only if it believed that an excessively large volume of medicine could lead to medication errors or safety issues due to inappropriate multiple dosing.In other words, as long as nurses are not tempted to do anything but discard additional quantities, the drug agency is fine with extra-large, one-size-fits-all packaging. Congress has not given the drug agency the authority to consider cost in its decisions.Companies propose the vial sizes that they would like to market, Mr. Kelly said.Rising drug prices have been a concern for many years, and high initial prices and subsequent increases are an industrywide phenomenon. The last 10 cancer drugs approved before July 2015 have an average annual price of $190,217, and major drug makers routinely increase the prices of big sellers 10 percent or more each year, far above the rate of inflation.The industry explains that high prices are needed to fund research, but companies such as Pfizer and Merck spend just 17 percent of their revenues finding new drugs, according to their financial statements. Far more goes to marketing and profits.For decades, cancer doctors largely ignored the issue of pricing, but as their patients became impoverished, some began to speak up. In 2012, Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times announcing that their hospital would not purchase a new cancer drug that was twice as expensive as but no more effective than an existing medicine. The maker of the drug slashed its price.Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz say they have since become concerned that prices of new cancer medicines have almost no connection with their lifesaving potential. Dr. Bach recently unveiled a complex calculator of drug value.But there was nothing complex about measuring the value of a drug that was thrown away, Dr. Saltz said, since the value to the patient was zero.The two doctors have proposed that the government either mandate that drug makers provide medicines in enough vial sizes to minimize waste, or mandate that drug makers refund the government for wasted quantities.Dr. Saltz first noticed the problem of waste when he was considering adding Keytruda, a new drug for metastatic lung cancer and melanoma, to the hospitals list of drugs to be used on patients. Although a 150-pound patient would need 136 milligrams of the drug, Dr. Saltz noticed that Merck, its manufacturer, sold the medicine only in 50-milligram vials  ensuring waste.I thought that was really cynical, Dr. Saltz said in an interview. And then it got worse.In February 2015, Merck introduced 100-milligram vials and stopped selling Keytruda in 50-milligram vials, ensuring far larger amounts of waste. The company still sells 50-milligram vials of the drug in Europe.Pamela L. Eisele, a Merck spokeswoman, said the company hoped to persuade the F.D.A. to approve a fixed dose of 200 milligrams of Keytruda for all patients, higher than the dose presently given to nearly all patients. In studies given to the drug agency, there was no evidence that the higher dose was more effective, Ms. Eisele said, but the fixed dose will eliminate wastage.Since the extra medicine does nothing to help patients, Dr. Bach said that the company was advocating that waste be injected into patients rather than thrown away.Under its present dosing, Merck would earn $2.4 billion over the next five years from discarded quantities of Keytruda, half of which would result from switching to 100-milligram vials, the researchers estimated.Some cancer drugs have little waste.Treanda, which is used to treat leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma and is manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is packaged in four separate dosages so only 1 percent of the drug is wasted, on average.But 18 of the top 20 cancer medicines are sold in just one or two vial sizes, so on average 10 percent of the volume of cancer drugs purchased by doctors and hospitals is discarded, the researchers say."}

{"text": "Few operatic characters are better equipped to steal scenes than the adolescent page Cherubino in Mozarts Le Nozze di Figaro: a young man ridden by hormones and given gorgeous arias pulsing with sensuality. That the role is allotted to a grown woman only increases the opportunities for sophisticated humor and low farce.So it came as little surprise that on Thursday evening, when Richard Eyres 2014 production of Figaro returned to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera with the wonderful Isabel Leonard again in that role, Cherubino ruled. Ms. Leonards lustrous, full-bodied mezzo-soprano and her exquisite comic timing seized attention at every turn.Not that the competition is all that strong in this revival. True, Luca Pisaroni, a proven scene stealer himself, portrayed the Count compellingly, his rich, solid bass-baritone projecting cleanly, his lustful finagling written on his every oily snoop and gesture.Rachel Willis-Sorensen, though a stiffer character as the Countess, rose to her big arias beautifully. But the figures at the center  Mikhail Petrenko as Figaro and Anita Hartig as Susanna, his bride-to-be  were slow to make their presence felt. Both were more than adequate vocally, and Ms. Hartig took on some personality, but Mr. Petrenko remained rather colorless, often hard to pick out of a crowd.Rob Howells monumental and fussy set gives the sense of a crowd even where there is none, and of huge public spaces rather than intimate rooms. Still, Mr. Eyres direction of the characters, as carried through by the current stage director, Jonathon Loy, generally works well enough to make human connections.Robert McPherson made his Met debut as an amusingly bluff Don Basilio opposite the practiced Marcellina of Susanne Mentzer (a onetime Cherubino). Ashley Emerson was touching as Barbarina.The orchestra sounded in top form with Fabio Luisi, the Mets principal conductor, in charge, revealing unremembered details and previously unnoticed subtleties. The players seemed to be sitting  just barely  on the edges of their seats, ready to pounce on Mr. Luisis beat, sometimes even anticipating it in the early going. The chorus, trained by Donald Palumbo, was its usual fine self."}
{"text": "Some social scientists spend their careers researching small-scale topics that may help push forward our understanding of bigger forces shaping our lives. Or not. Many academic papers are never cited.Thats not an issue with Minxin Pei. He aims high and goes for the jugular, taking on one of the biggest topics imaginable in political science: Will Chinas Communist Party stay in power in its present, authoritarian form? Mr. Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, argues that the odds are high that by 2030, Chinas government will be quite different, pushed to change by the endemic corruption of the current party system. Corruption is the subject of his forthcoming book, Chinas Crony Capitalism: The Dynamics of Regime Decay.In an interview, he discussed why he believes one-party rule in China is unsustainable.Q. You argue that for the Chinese Communist Party to make it past 2030 in its present form would break a lot of precedents. Why that date?A. At present, Chinas socioeconomic development, measured in income and education attainment, has reached the median level at which comparable countries (Communist, middle-income and Asian) made the transition from dictatorship to some form of democracy in the last 40 years. If Chinas development continues in the next 15 years, even at a much slower pace, it will have created, by 2030, a society in which maintaining an autocratic regime is far more difficult, if not impossible. Historically, no autocratic regimes have survived for more than 74 years, because of the decay of their ideology and the corruption of the ruling elites. The Communist Party will have been in power for 81 years by 2030.Q. What do you see happening in China that supports your thesis that the party may already be experiencing regime decay and following the path taken in other countries?A. The most important evidence is the pervasive corruption of the ruling elites. Elite unity has also disintegrated, as shown by the purge of Bo Xilai, Ling Jihua, Zhou Yongkang and their cronies since 2012. The atrophy of ideology has deprived the party of its sense of mission and a vital instrument of motivating its rank and file. The economic and moral costs of maintaining one-party rule through repression have also reached unsustainable levels.Q. Whats the most likely scenario? Reform? Revolution? Or, as you put it, a combination of the two, refolution?A. Reform  democratizing reform  is still a preferred scenario, but the window is closing fast, and historically not a single Communist regime has been reformed into democracy successfully. Revolution, a Tiananmen-style mass uprising, is unlikely because Chinese security forces can crush that easily. Refolution, a process that starts with limited reform but becomes radicalized, is the more likely scenario. We can envision such a scenario in the mid-2020s when the party, after a decade of political decay and economic stagnation, becomes desperate enough to gamble with political reform to save itself. But the window for reform will have closed by then and, like the late Soviet Union, limited reform fractures the ruling elites, mobilizes social forces seeking fundamental change and unleashes a revolution.Q. You have been making an argument that Chinas system will change for some time. You published From Reform to Revolution back in 1994, which posited the demise of the Chinese Communist Party. Some argue that the party is in many ways more durable now than a generation ago. Are they wrong?A. Actually in my 1994 book I referred to the demise of Communism, not the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, like many others, I was optimistic that economic reform could loosen the partys grip and eventually lead to political change. But subsequent events proved this assumption too simplistic. We did not anticipate that economic success could bolster the partys rule for a considerable period of time and block political change.However, because of the predatory nature of one-party rule, such economic success cannot last. I came to this conclusion in my 2006 book, Chinas Trapped Transition, which makes the case that economic modernization under one-party rule is doomed to fail.As for other analysts who believe that the party is more durable than before, the factors they cite are no longer there. Growth is slowing. The party is in disarray, because the rules it has established to limit internecine political warfare have collapsed. Beijings foreign policy is driving the Sino-U.S. relationship toward conflict. Middle-class acquiescence is beginning to erode because of environmental degradation, poor services, inequality and corruption.Q. In investing, theres the adage that past performance is no guarantee of future results. How useful is it to use the example of other nations to predict what may happen to China?A. Actually this adage also applies to the party itself. This means that its past success does not guarantee its future survival. In thinking about the partys future, the examples of other nations offer useful insights into how ruling elites react to changing environments.China may be huge, but it is governed by human beings who, like their counterparts in smaller nations, make choices that are limited by practical and predictable constraints. In comparative politics, using examples of other nations may not yield the best results, but it is still a better approach than studying a tree as if no forest exists.Q. Chinas leaders want to avoid the middle-income trap that has prevented so many countries from transitioning to high-income status. Are the odds stacked against it if it doesnt reform its politics?A. The historical record is not encouraging for the Communist Party. Except for oil-producing autocracies, semi-democratic Singapore and the ex-British colony Hong Kong, only established democracies and newly democratized countries have escaped the middle-income trap.Aside from purely economic challenges, history offers two insights. One is that dictatorships are very likely to fall at the middle-income level. That is why we dont see high-income autocracies outside the oil-producing states. The other one is that dictatorships steal too much from their societies and cannot sustain economic growth. Countries that cannot shake off dictatorships are trapped in middle income. This does not mean that democratization alone will lead to high income. It will not. But getting rid of dictatorship is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition, for reaching high income.Q. How has your thesis been received by other China experts and political scientists?A. It has aroused a great deal of interest, but also a lot of skepticism. This is understandable since regime transition is an ultralow probability event. But we also want to avoid making the same mistake as missing the fall of the U.S.S.R. or the Arab Spring. As a serious intellectual exercise with potentially profound policy implications, a systematic and evidence-based debate on Chinas future is both healthy and long overdue."}
{"text": "We never gave much thought to circumcision. Our son was a surviving twin born at 27 weeks gestation. He spent the first 76 days of his life in the newborn intensive care unit at Prentice Womens Hospital in Chicago. Because he was fighting for his life, there were more pressing matters to consider than the shape of his penis.I had never really questioned why I was circumcised. It wasnt done for religious reasons. And I had never wondered what my life would have been like had I not been snipped. The look and shape of my penis are nothing more than a part of who I am. No different, really, than the hair on my chest or the mole above my left eyebrow.The doctors first brought up the subject a week before our sons discharge. They told us that if we wanted to have him circumcised, it would be most convenient to schedule it with his hernia surgery. It would be a two-for-one.My wife had said that because I was the one with the penis, the decision was up to me. For me, there wasnt a choice. Im circumcised. Of course my son would be.The surgery was a success, except that the doctors thought he was too small to circumcise. They recommended that we return a few weeks later for an outpatient procedure.Christina began to have second thoughts about putting him under the knife again. I did not share her concerns.A few days later, I was on the phone with my friend Brooks, updating him on our sons progress and talking through a potential hot topic within my family: my hard-line stance against baptism.I was raised Catholic. I had served as an altar boy, attended Catholic school for 12 years and hardly ever missed a Sunday Mass throughout my childhood in Staten Island, the Bronx and the Jersey Shore. Today, I am no longer a practicing Catholic. Except for weddings, I have not attended church in years.We intend to expose our son to the many religions of the world, and if there comes a day when he wants to identify with one, then he will make an informed decision. I had thought this through for months. Christina, who is not Catholic, agreed.I told all of this to Brooks. He understood. Then he threw me a curveball: Did we plan to go ahead with the circumcision?Well, yeah, of course, I quickly replied.So you dont want to baptize your son, but you wont hesitate to have his foreskin cut?I found myself tongue-tied and slightly embarrassed. How could I have not given circumcision more thought? I had convictions regarding baptism. But to have our son circumcised for no reason other than the fact that it was done to me? By the same logic, I may as well have him baptized.But for my son to have his penis look absolutely nothing like mine, well, it worried me somehow. If he ever had questions about his, I wouldnt have the firsthand experience to offer answers. And if he saw me naked, he might notice the difference. Would he feel less of a father-son connection to me, as paranoid as that may sound?We researched the four methods that use a clamp, as well as the Plastibell method, the procedure favored by the hospital where he would be circumcised.The American Academy of Pediatrics says that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks, but they arent profound enough to recommend the procedure universally. The potential consequences of not having our son circumcised included varying degrees of risk, such as greater odds of developing urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and even penile cancer  all enough to instill more fear in me, regardless of how low some of those risks were.I do not recommend viewing the Google Image search results for circumcision.I fell deep down a cyber-rabbit hole into a world of first-person essays on sites like Cosmopolitan.com and Jezebel, describing womens sexual escapades with natural men. The reviews were mixed.I was hoping Christina had been with an uncircumcised man so she could provide insight, but I figured she would have said something by now and, alas, she had not. I considered asking female friends about their experiences but couldnt work up the guts and didnt know whom I should ask. My fears and ego were getting the better of me. I didnt want to make the wrong decision for my son.In the end, Christina and I kept coming back to two things: that the procedure meant pain, regardless of how temporary, and that in our sons case, it seemed not to serve any medical purpose. As my wife put it, its just another form of cosmetic surgery.Two days later, at his first pediatrician appointment, his doctor, who is Romanian, cautioned that there are different ways to interpret data from the many studies. She also recommended that we look into the World Health Organizations findings, which in 2007 showed that circumcision is more prevalent in America than anywhere else; in fact, Western European countries have circumcision rates of less than 20 percent. That number made me feel even better about our decision.Our son recently turned a year old, and I still play the what if? game in my head. What if he questions why we look different down there? What if during middle school he gets picked on in the locker room for being the only uncircumcised kid? What if women see this as a deal breaker? What if he has reduced sexual pleasure?Then I remember these fears are occurring because I am way out of my little comfort zone  out of Americas comfort zone, really.And thats exactly the type of father I want to be: a man who models for his son that hes not afraid to challenge his default ways of thinking."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Amy Brenneman, an actress, wants Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to know about the abortion she had when she was a 21-year-old college junior.Taking a page from the movement for same-sex marriage, Ms. Brenneman and more than 100 other women have filed several supporting briefs in a major Supreme Court abortion case to be argued on Wednesday. The briefs tell the stories of women who say their abortions allowed them to control their bodies, plan for the future and welcome children into their lives when their careers were established and their personal lives were on solid ground.The briefs are aimed largely at Justice Kennedy, who holds the crucial vote in abortion cases. They use language and concepts from his four major gay rights decisions, notably his invocation of equal dignity in Junes ruling establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.Why has marriage equality gained so much ground, and reproductive justice seems to be losing so much ground? Ms. Brenneman, known for her roles on NYPD Blue and Judging Amy, said in an interview. Partly, she said, because gay couples have come out of the shadows but many women still believe abortions to be shameful secrets.The briefs seek to counter that, as well as what some people saw as a streak of uninformed paternalism in a 2007 majority opinion in which Justice Kennedy said many women regretted their decisions to have abortions and experienced depression and plunging self-esteemBut Allan E. Parker Jr., a lawyer with the anti-abortion group the Justice Foundation, said the womens briefs may only alienate Justice Kennedy.The abortion industry is trying to make it sound like abortion is a joyful experience, he said. But even women who say it was necessary say it was not joyful. It is a grief and a blackness, and it changes you.Mr. Parker filed a brief on behalf of more than 3,000 women, many identified by their first names or initials, who say they suffered psychological or physical harm from their abortions.Because abortion is such a difficult and painful decision, the brief said, the initial reaction may be relief because the trauma of the actual event is over and the decision making process is over, but that may sow the seeds of trauma and emotional injury that lasts for decades.Helen J. Knowles, the author of The Tie Goes to Freedom: Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on Liberty, said she had her doubts about appealing to Justice Kennedy by using personal stories.I suspect that taking that approach is not going to get much traction with Justice Kennedy, she said. Im just not convinced that this is the right way to come at him in this case.The better approach, one taken in many other briefs, she said, is to focus on the obstacles created by the Texas law rather than on general conceptions of motherhood.Wednesdays case, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 15-274, concerns a challenge to a restrictive Texas law brought by several abortion clinics in the state. They say the law could reduce the number of clinics in Texas to about 10 from roughly 40 by requiring doctors who perform abortions to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and requiring clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers.The courts balance of power has shifted with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but abortion rights advocates will almost certainly still have to secure Justice Kennedys vote to win the case. A 4-to-4 tie would automatically affirm an appeals court decision that sustained the restrictions with minor exceptions.Justice Kennedys abortion jurisprudence is muddled.In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he joined Justices Sandra Day OConnor and David H. Souter in a joint opinion that reaffirmed the core of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life, the joint opinion said, in a passage that only Justice Kennedy could have drafted.But Justice Kennedys reputation as an abortion rights champion is undeserved, said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. He has only once found an abortion restriction unconstitutional in his 28 years on the Supreme Court, Professor Cohen said, while allowing 20 other restrictions to go into effect.In 2007, Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion upholding the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, supplementing his legal analysis with observations about motherhood.Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child, he wrote, adding: While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.Janice Mac Avoy, a lawyer with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, said the passage troubled her. It was incredibly paternalistic, she said.She told her story in a brief signed by 113 female lawyers who said they did not regret their abortions.I was 18 years old, in high school, outside of St. Louis, Ms. Mac Avoy said in an interview. I was about to be the first person in my family to graduate from high school. And I had a scholarship to college, and I knew that I wanted to go to law school. And I knew that being a mother was not compatible with any of those things at that time in my life.Ms. Brenneman also said Justice Kennedys musings about regret were misguided.It is patronizing, she said. It is saying that women are not capable of knowing their own mental health. And 95 percent of women do not regret it, so this is an opportunity to set the math straight.In her own case, Ms. Brenneman said she was a 21-year-old junior at Harvard when her birth control failed and she had an abortion. It allowed me to choose when to become a mother, she said. As a mother now, I know I was correct at 21.I didnt have a college degree, she said. I didnt have an income. I didnt have a marriage. I didnt have anything a child needs. And I didnt want it.Professor Cohen, who has filed a brief supporting the Texas clinics, said the womens briefs were unusual in focusing on real-life narratives.They are not addressing any legal principle but are trying to get inside Justice Kennedys head that women are moral agents who make decisions and that regret is not something that should be part of his thinking, Professor Cohen said. It was clearly part of his thinking in 2007.Michael J. Dell, a lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel who represents Ms. Brenneman and other women, said it was worth reminding the justices that abortions are common.There shouldnt be a stigma, he said. A third of women have abortions. Many of the people that Supreme Court justices know and socialize with, and their children and friends, have had abortions, and theyre probably totally unaware of it.Alexia D. Korberg, a lawyer with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represents the female lawyers, said her work on a major gay rights case had informed the legal strategy in the abortion case.We had seen just how powerful humanizing issues that can seem abstract can be, not just for the justices but for everyone, and how powerful empathy can be, Ms. Korberg said.However effective such an approach may be, much of the attention at the Supreme Court on Wednesday will be focused on Justice Kennedy, as often happens and for good reason. One mans perception of abortion is what matters the most here, Professor Cohen said."}
{"text": "Argentina has agreed to pay $4.65 billion to four hedge funds in a deal that could put an end to more than a decade of mudslinging and legal attacks that had cut the country off from global financial markets.The agreement, announced on Monday, opens the door for Argentina to attract foreign investment needed to revive its stalling economy.This is the equivalent of a giant albatross being lifted from Argentinas neck, said Brett Diment, the head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management. The litigation and lack of access to international capital has had a sclerotic effect on the country for years but it was facing a real financial squeeze this year, he said.The four hedge funds, which include the billionaire Paul E. Singers NML Capital, were the last major hedge fund investors among a group that declared legal war on Argentina in the United States courts 12 years ago.These holdouts, so named for their refusal to participate in Argentinas two restructurings after the country defaulted on $100 billion of debt in 2001, sought billions in bond repayments and eventually succeeded in preventing Argentina from paying any of its creditors.And they went to great lengths to compel Argentina to pay  at one point persuading authorities in Ghana to seize an Argentine navy ship as collateral, with a crew of about 300 on board. They also moved to impound other government assets, including a satellite.Their ultimate victory illustrates the outsize influence hedge funds can have in the countries where they bet their money. And their legal tactics are likely to be used again by other investors contesting the debt obligations of sovereign powers.The four holdout firms, including Aurelius, a hedge fund run by Mark Brodsky, a former trader at Mr. Singers Elliott Management; Davidson Kempner; and Bracebridge Capital, have agreed not to try to prevent Argentina from raising new money, which it will need to do in order to pay the settlements it has made.The deal will also depend on whether Argentinas legislature will repeal domestic laws that prevent the government from paying holdouts. The parties agreed on a deadline of April 14 to pay the settlement.The settlement will be extremely profitable for the hedge funds. Martin M. Guzman, a postdoctoral research scholar at Columbia Business School, has estimated that NML paid $48 million for some bonds it bought in 2008 and with the deal it will receive approximately $620 million for those bonds  an annual return of about 38 percent over eight years.For Mr. Singer, who has supported Republican candidates and gay marriage, principle was as important, if not more, than profit, in pursuing a nearly 15-year fight.By being a country that scoffs at the rule of law, they sacrifice so much, Mr. Singer said in a recent interview. NMLs investments in Argentine debt and other sovereign debt represented less than 2 percent of the $26 billion in assets that his hedge fund company, Elliott Management, manages over all, he noted.A spokesman for Elliott said on Monday that the firm was pleased to have reached an agreement.Pressure had been growing on the holdouts to settle with Argentina after its newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, moved quickly to settle with other bondholders. His government struck a $1.35 billion settlement with a group of Italian investors and offered to pay $6.5 billion to the group of six hedge fund holdouts in February. Two of those firms, Montreux Partners and Dart Management, accepted the proposal.On Feb. 19, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has presided over the lengthy legal battle, dealt the holdouts a setback by agreeing to lift an injunction that has prevented Argentina from raising new money in bond markets or paying its creditors.This is a giant step forward in this long-running litigation, Daniel A. Pollack, the court-appointed mediator, said on Monday, adding that Argentinas decision to settle was nothing short of heroicThe $4.65 billion represents 75 percent of the full judgments for the four hedge funds and includes principal, interest and a payment to settle the claims outside of the court, as well as certain legal fees and expenses incurred.The battle between the holdouts and Argentina reached a nadir under the previous president, Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, who called the holdouts vultures and financial terrorists.Axel Kicillof, the former economy minister, even sought to question the impartiality of the mediator, Mr. Pollack, saying a year ago: If he takes off his jacket you can see his feathers, referring to the vultures.For the first time in 15 years, we can say that Argentina has really started to exit default, Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentinas new economy minister, told reporters in Buenos Aires on Monday, adding that the situation had drowned the economy.He attacked the Kirchner administration for refusing to settle the issue, adding that by letting the dispute fester, interest had accumulated and investors had lost confidence.These lost investments and central bank reserves used to service tens of billion of dollars of debt in recent years could have been poured into the economy, creating up to two million jobs, Mr. Prat-Gay said.Argentina would sell up to $15 billion in bonds from April to finance the payment, he added.Argentina is joining the world in an intelligent way, Mr. Prat-Gay said.That nations legislature could take most of March to debate whether to revoke the law, and a decision should be expected by the end of the month, according to Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst.Despite the accord, Argentinas bonds were little changed on Monday, showing that investors had already priced in a deal.The reverberations from the legal battle with Argentina may be felt for years to come.In 2012, the holdout hedge funds achieved a stunning breakthrough when Judge Griesa ruled that whenever Argentina wanted to pay any of its creditors, it would have to also pay the holdouts. The move and its fallout led Argentina to default on its debt again in 2014.That move will have far-reaching implications, many analysts say. With his ruling, the judge has laid the foundations for future investors to contest the debt obligations of other countries.Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University, said that the ruling created a new tool for investors.The tool is a kind of financial boycott that would allow creditors to enforce equal payment in other instances, she added.Mr. Guzman went further, saying that the settlement created a problem of moral hazard in which this settlement incentivizes this type of behavior because it is profitable."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   There was something like a consensus at the Supreme Court on Monday that it was not a good idea for a judge to hear a death penalty case he had worked on as a district attorney. But the justices seemed divided over how to fashion a constitutional rule that would bar such conduct yet not require judges to recuse themselves whenever they had had a glancing encounter with the matter under review.You want us to get pretty deeply into the issue of a constitutional recusal policy for judges, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. told a lawyer for a death row inmate in Pennsylvania. So its really not enough to just say what happened here was bad.The case started in 1986 when Terrance Williams and a friend, both 18, beat Amos Norwood, 56, to death with a tire iron.Philadelphias district attorney, Ronald D. Castille, authorized a capital prosecution of Mr. Williams. Approved to proceed on the death penalty, he wrote on a subordinates memorandum.Mr. Williams was convicted and sentenced to death. Mr. Castille went on to serve on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.In 2012, as the courts chief justice, Mr. Castille denied a request from Mr. Williamss lawyers that he disqualify himself from hearing an appeal based on claims of prosecutorial misconduct by the office he had led, ones that a lower court had accepted. About two weeks before he retired at the end of 2014, Mr. Castille joined a unanimous decision reinstating Mr. Williamss death sentence.In a recent interview, Mr. Castille said his role in the case as district attorney had been merely administrative. I didnt try the case, he said. I wasnt really involved in the case except as the leader of the office.On Monday, several justices seemed frustrated by the reluctance of the lawyers before them to propose a clear and simple standard that would govern all cases in which a judge had had some prior involvement in a case.Merely having signed an indictment as a prosecutor would not require recusal, said Stuart B. Lev, a lawyer for Mr. Williams. Only personal involvement in a substantial decision should count, he said, and then only if that decision figured in the legal issues under appeal.Ronald Eisenberg, a lawyer in the Philadelphia district attorneys office, said courts should consider the level of the prosecutors involvement and how long ago it happened to determine whether there was an intolerable probability of actual bias.Neither proposal seemed to satisfy Justice Alito. Recusal is constitutionally required or not, he said. I really dont see a clear rule that would encompass this situation, other than a rule that a judge is required by the Constitution to recuse in any case in which the judge had personal participation as a prosecutor. Anything other than that seems to me to be pretty fuzzy.Justice Elena Kagan said that the case was simple. He made the most important decision that could be made in this case, she said of Mr. Castille."}
{"text": "It is hard to go almost anywhere in Harlem with Michael Henry Adams, at least not in a hurry.Every block offers a moment of contemplation, every corner a revelation, every step an interruption.I love you, my brother, a man walking his dog told Mr. Adams as they crossed Frederick Douglass Boulevard last week. Youre a mentor and an icon.Mr. Adams, a historian and rabble-rouser who has called Harlem home for the past 30 years, was making his way down West 136th Street, to a former funeral home  designed by the states second black architect, site of the funerals of the performers Florence Mills and Bill Robinson, and since replaced by a homeless shelter  when he stopped again. Standing across 136th Street from No. 267, he let out a sigh, one of many during a nearly three-hour tour of his beloved and bedraggled neighborhood.This used to be the home and hangout of Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman and so many of the literary luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Their former rooming house stood here until 2002, when New York City sold the peaked-roof brownstone, one of six in a matching row, to an investor from Rye, N.Y. The home came down, and a new one, no bigger, was built in its place, its most distinguishing feature being a driveway.This would never be allowed to happen in the Village or the Upper East Side, Mr. Adams lamented. Yet in Harlem, its a fact of everyday life.This should have been a moment of celebration, because last week the  Landmarks Preservation Commission moved ahead with four of six properties in Upper Manhattan that had been stuck in a bureaucratic backlog for decades. It was a far better outcome than in Queens or on Staten Island, where only a small fraction of the dozens of historic places up for consideration were recommended for protection.Yet Mr. Adams was less concerned with two churches, a Loews movie palace and a Y.M.C.A. that had been saved than the ones that got away, specifically the former D. G. Yuengling Brewery. The complex of 10 red-brick properties dates from the 1860s, long before the subway arrived and the stout brownstones and grand churches with it. Now, a developer wants to turn this into part of a million-square-foot commercial hub near Columbia Universitys new Manhattanville campus, and the builders had enlisted a number of community groups last year for support at the commission.Mr. Adams had taken pro bono lawyers with him to challenge the decision, but they later decided there was no recourse.Its the same old song and dance, Mr. Adams said.While being an active member of the citys sprawling preservation movement, Mr. Adams is also one of its loudest critics. He sees biases against certain neighborhoods and institutions, and nowhere more than in his backyard.Walk most avenues in Central Harlem, and the tidy townhouses march along at all angles. They may not always be as well kept as those in Park Slope, Brooklyn, or Greenwich Village, but they are no less grand, and often more so. And yet only 17 percent of properties are protected there, according to the landmarks commission. More affluent, less diverse neighborhoods like Greenwich Village, SoHo, TriBeCa and Brooklyn Heights have protection for 60 to 90 percent of their areas.Christopher Moore, a former curator at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and one of the longest-serving commissioners at the landmarks commission, from 1995 to 2015, says he thinks the problem, especially in Harlem, is engagement. Landmarking is rarely a neighborhoods top concern when there are more pressing issues, Mr. Moore said. The commission is not omnipotent, like many people think. God bless Michael Adams, but this is not a one-man show.Over the past decade, the commission has made notable strides in expanding its coverage outside Manhattan  where more than one in four properties is protected  to include areas with a greater diversity of buildings and people, such as Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; Ridgewood, Queens; and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. The two most recent districts approved last year were expansions of Mount Morris Park in Harlem and a new Bedford district in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.Claudette Brady, a co-founder of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Society for Historic Preservation, is grateful for such recognition, though it has been hard fought: It took two decades for an expansion of the Stuyvesant Heights Historic District (first established in 1971) to be approved in 2013. Part of the challenge was persuading local homeowners; part was persuading the establishment that controlled their fate.I think a lot of it comes from people outside the community presuming to know what the community wants, Ms. Brady said.There are proposals for at least three other districts in the neighborhood  properties cannot be altered or built in such areas without the commissions approval  but Ms. Brady fears those may never come. It doesnt have anything to do with us being black and everything to do with the real estate developers and whos in power now, Ms. Brady said.In line with the de Blasio administrations focus on equity, the new commission chairwoman, Meenakshi Srinivasan, has made expanding the diversity of districts a priority.The experiences of different communities are fundamental to New Yorks legacy and culture, and should be protected and preserved  particularly when theyre reflected in our built environment, she said in a statement.For Mr. Adams, it may be too little, too late. With Harlem in decline in the 1970s at the same moment the preservation movement was taking hold citywide, preserving Harlem fell by the wayside. By the time the community was stabilizing and organizing to take action, its popularity complicated efforts. The push for development came into conflict with preservation, as in the case of the Yuengling site and other recent losses like the Renaissance Ballroom, a famed theater and nightclub; and Lenox Lounge, the beloved jazz venue.While many landlords argue that preservation stymies investment, there are business leaders in Harlem who find the past equally valuable.Those who are looking for the quick buck, I understand what theyre doing, said Lloyd Williams, president of the Harlem Chamber of Commerce. But its the responsibility of our leaders to fight for our history, on which many of our businesses thrive.Some preservationists suggest Mr. Adams may have done as much harm as good in Harlem with his often-confrontational style, picketing public meetings and holding protests on street corners, always in a sharp suit and a bowler or a boater hat, depending on the season. People tell me you tame more bees with honey, Mr. Adams said, but what can you do when the bee is about to sting you?To help expand the effort, Mr. Adams and some supporters established a new group last year, Save Harlem Now, to educate new and old residents about the treasures they have, and those they could lose.Weve got Colonial history, African-American history, Jewish history, Puerto Rican history, Cuban history  it was our learning lab of diversity, and it could all be lost, said Valerie Jo Bradley, one of the co-founders, sitting inside the tin-ceilinged parlor of the brownstone she bought for $36,000 in 1980. She marvels that Maya Angelous home is for sale one block over for $5 million.The group took its name from the rallying cry Mr. Adams has been using for years, one he had almost given up on after recent encounters trying, unsuccessfully, to resurrect the Renaissance Ballroom, one he is committed to now more than ever.I was there every Sunday shouting: Save Harlem now! Save Harlem now! Save Harlem now! Mr. Adams recalled. And so many people stopped and told me it was too late."}
{"text": "A cheetah known as Chewbaaka has helped scientists time-travel through that species long, complex history, even providing some clues about how the big cats became the worlds fastest land animals.Chewbaaka, rescued as a 10-day-old orphan in Namibia, became an ambassador animal for the Cheetah Conservation Fund there. (His name is a variation of the Star Wars characters.) He died five years ago at the advanced age of 16  twice the life span of the average cheetah in the wild  but not before geneticists drew his blood. Along with blood samples from six other cheetahs from Namibia and East Africa, his has now been used to sequence the species complete genome  its full set of chromosomes.With their spotted coats and black teardrop facial markings, cheetahs are a favorite of tourists on photographic safaris. The animals race across the African savanna at speeds close to 60 miles per hour because of their unique physiology: elongated legs, aerodynamic skull, enlarged adrenal glands and heart muscles, and claws that grip the earth like football cleats. Considered critically endangered, cheetahs number only about 10,000 today, with most living in southern and eastern Africa.What the genomic analysis reveals is not encouraging: The cheetah has less than 5 percent of the genomic diversity of other wild cats, a level much lower than even inbred domestic dogs and cats and the lowest among the 30 mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. Genetic diversity in an animal is determined by variation in enzyme genes inherited by an animals two parents and is critical to its healthy reproduction and immunity to disease.Scientists began to suspect that the cheetah was genetically monotonous several decades ago. Surgical skin grafts done experimentally among unrelated cheetahs were tolerated without the normal rate of tissue rejection, as if all the animals were identical twins. Cheetahs in captivity were difficult to breed and had unusually high mortality rates among the cubs. And the animals showed high vulnerability to outbreaks of disease.Recently, scientists at the Theodosius Dobzhansky Center for Genome Bioinformatics at St. Petersburg State University in Russia collaborated with BGI-Shenzhen in China and the Cheetah Conservation Fund to analyze the entire genome of the species. The 35-member team, led by Pavel Dobrynin and Stephen OBrien, both of the Dobzhansky Center, figured out the specific underpinnings of the cheetahs genetic impoverishment and glimpsed the evolutionary chain of events that produced its unparalleled running speed. The research was published in the journal Genome Biology.The three-million-year-old tale of the cheetah is punctuated by two major events that greatly reduced the animals genetic diversity. The fossil record shows that the first occurred about 100,000 years ago, when cheetahs inhabited North America alongside their cousin the puma. At that time, cheetahs began migrating across the Bering Strait into Asia, and ultimately into Africa, producing a series of population bottlenecks. Numbers of the animals dropped so low that they were forced to practice inbreeding to survive. Then, late in the Pleistocene epoch, a global extinction event caused cheetah populations to crash. Cheetahs again resorted to inbreeding, barely escaping extinction.By homing in on a series of mutations that occur on a known timetable, the international team of geneticists calculated exactly when these population bottlenecks occurred, confirming that they coincided with the two ancient events and pinpointing the second, Pleistocene bottleneck, 11,084 to 12,589 years ago.The reason cheetahs tolerated skin grafts also crystallized for the researchers. An important cadre of genes that mediates graft rejection was near uniform across different cheetahs, Dr. OBrien said. All cheetahs tested had actually disarmed four of these key genes entirely.In addition, the sequencing of the genome illuminated gene mutations that probably explain the sperm abnormalities seen in all cheetahs today. Gene AKAP4, known to regulate sperm development in humans, showed remarkable signatures of natural selection because of 10 mutations, five of them likely to block normal sperm development.But what makes the cheetah run? For this function, natural selection was on the animals side. Eleven different genes showed evidence of mutations occurring over generations that boosted the animals muscle contraction, stress response and regulation of energy-releasing processes, all of which beefed up the big cats running prowess.Despite the genetic deck being stacked against them, cheetahs in Africa rallied over the centuries from their population crashes, at one point numbering hundreds of thousands. Today, though, with only about 10,000 remaining, they face even more serious threats in their dwindling home territory: loss of habitat and frequent fatal conflicts with humans.The cheetah is the poster species for genetic impoverishment, but also a success story, Dr. OBrien said. With some conservation help from people, they should be able to survive their genetic disadvantages.And for that, they owe Chewbaaka a debt of gratitude.Chewbaaka was truly an amazing cheetah, and very famous, so it seems only fitting that his biological samples provide the basis for the genome study, said Laurie Marker, an author of the paper and founder and executive director of the Cheetah Conservation Fund.Moving forward, all other cheetah genome sequences will be compared to his, she said. Similar to his namesake in the Star Wars movies  a Wookiee is a giving creature by nature  Chewbaaka will continue to give back to his species."}
{"text": "The SheepOver is an unusual feel-good story. Theres the brief narrative itself, in which an orphan lamb named Sweet Pea falls sick and, in a double-whammy happy ending, not only recovers under the tender care of her animal friends, attentive farmer-owners and a country vet named Alison, but is allowed to have a fantastic sleepover party in the greenhouse. Theres also the lovely glimpse the story gives of an interconnected rural utopia, in which farm animals, people and even wild animals look out for one another. And theres the storys deeper emotional level: It strikingly calls to mind small children acting out a real-life drama with, say, stuffed animals.Thats all aside from the almost miraculous story of the book itself: It was originally self-published by the Churchmans, who operate a small farm in Vermont and based The SheepOver on the true story of one of their own lambs. John Churchman is also a photographer, and he came up with a process to transform photos from the farm to accompany the narration. They brought the book to a local bookstore, whose owner loved it, and they soon found an agent and a fancy New York publisher, landing whats known in the business as a mid-six-figure deal for this book and several more about the creatures on their farm.Creating a picture book seems something like splatter art: It looks like such a natural process that everyone thinks they can do it. But that is simply not true. This sort of story happens pretty much never, despite the many self-published picture books out there, and all the agents and publishers hunting for the next hit.What separates The SheepOver from the self-published pack? A few things, I think. The story itself is perfectly paced and gently reassuring  two fail-safe qualities when it comes to holding the attention and interest of small children. The Churchmans seem to have come to them intuitively rather than through an apprenticeship in or study of childrens literature. There is a whiff of outsider art to the book  of not really caring, or perhaps not even knowing, what mainstream childrens books look like.Most professional childrens books creators, for example, would probably focus either on a sickness and recovery narrative or a party one  rather than combining those two arcs. Yet the pivot from Sweet Peas dire situation and the visit from the vet, and the animals festive sleepover party  with the farmers wife, Jennifer, making colorful trays of their favorite treats: pumpkin slices for Sunny, sweet beets for Violet, and for Sweet Pea, the tender tips of pine-tree branches  is just how children write their own stories, whether on a page or as they play. (And parents will love the fun-fruit-and-veggies theme.)There is also a devil-may-care pivot in how the animals talk and behave. At first they speak to express animal-like ideas, sentiments we can pretty much believe they are communicating, as when Buff Orpington the rooster crows: Sweet Pea, Sweet Pea! Somethings wrong with Sweet Pea! They are ordinary creatures, with the Churchmans translating for them. But when we get to the party scene, things get kooky. After they eat their treats, Sunny the lamb says, Lets dance now, and starts the music for dancing under the disco ball. The sheep appear to be smiling as the colorful light from the disco ball saturates the page. What kind of sheep are these, anyway?Perhaps most obviously, The SheepOver also walks its own path when it comes to the art. Picture books these days rarely use photography  Im not sure why, and I wish it werent true  and when they do, it is likely to be collaged. But Churchmans photos are different. The best way I can describe the look is slightly cracked. I say that because the surface appears crackly, and also because they are to me, frankly, strange and puzzling. The animals look lovable and cute, as much as you can see them, but the images seem oddly clouded.A note at the end describes his unique photo-illustration technique, and there may be some outsider-art instinct at work, too, in John Churchmans commitment to his own vision. It turns out, the note explains, that cracked-cloudy look is not random but deeply tied to the story: The frost patterns used as backdrops in the book were formed by the lambs warm breath freezing on the greenhouse windows overnight. Not, in other words, a technique they teach in picture-book school."}

{"text": "In the realm of bonds, negative yields are no bar to positive returns.Thats just as well, because more than a quarter of JPMorgans Global Government Bond Index, or $6.4 trillion worth of debt, was trading with a negative yield last week. German 10-year government bond yields could soon join Japanese and Swiss peers in subzero territory. Investors need to be nimble to make money in this looking-glass world.Negative-yield bonds are worth buying as long as yields keep declining. Yields move inversely to prices so this sort of trend allows investors to bank capital gains. But when these gains are the only difference between making or losing money, even small price swings hurt. This was the case in April 2015, when German yields started bouncing back from record lows. As more and more investors were forced to bail, yields shot up 21-fold in less than two months.Investors need to be quick to spot when a falling yield trend might be about to reverse, even if only temporarily. They also need to exploit pockets of relative value quickly before they disappear. For example, some negative-yield French bonds might be more attractively priced than their German counterparts and thus offer more scope for capital gains.There are good reasons longer-dated bond yields can keep falling in Germany and Japan. Central banks in both countries are buying government debt at a fair clip, and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, might even increase purchases at a March 10 policy meeting. Nor is there any sign of the nascent price pressures that might spell an end to such asset purchase programs. Investors are so sure of this that Japan on Tuesday became the first Group of 7 leading industrial nations to auction 10-year debt at a negative yield.But shocks cannot be ruled out. Imagine if Mr. Draghi unexpectedly ditches the requirement to buy bonds in proportion to each eurozone countrys contribution to the E.C.B.s capital. Anything that implies fewer-than-expected purchases of German government bonds would produce a sharp reversal in the trend of lower Bund yields  and a lot of burned fingers."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   An elite American Special Operations force has captured a significant Islamic State operative in Iraq and is expected to apprehend and interrogate a number of others in coming months, ushering in a new and potentially fraught phase in the fight against the extremist Sunni militant group.American defense officials described the capture as a crucial development in battling the Islamic State but said it also raised questions about handling what is likely to be a growing group of detainees.Although American commandos have captured a handful of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria in discrete operations in recent years, the Pentagon is now faced with the prospect of detaining a larger group of captives and potentially reprising some of the darkest images of the war in Iraq, particularly the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison.The American military has largely fought the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from the sky, and large numbers of Islamic State fighters have been killed in Iraq and Syria by American airstrikes. The 200-member Special Operations team, made up of many Delta Force commandos, arrived in Iraq in recent weeks and is the first major American combat force on the ground there since the United States pulled out of the country at the end of 2011.Defense officials said the team had set up safe houses and worked with Iraqi and Kurdish forces to establish informant networks and conduct raids on Islamic State leaders and other important militants.Officials said the detainee, whom they declined to identify, was being interrogated by American officials at a temporary detention facility in the city of Erbil in northern Iraq. They said the plan was to eventually turn him over to Iraqi or Kurdish officials.Several Defense Department officials declined to say how much information or cooperation they have received from the detainee. They said it could take weeks or months to finish questioning the operative.As is protocol, Defense Department officials notified the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors the treatment of detainees, that they were holding an Islamic State fighter. A Red Cross spokesman, Trevor Keck, declined to comment on the matter, including on whether Red Cross personnel were observing the detainees treatment at the facility in Erbil.Defense Department officials said that the United States had no plans to hold the detainee or others indefinitely, and that they would be handed over to Iraqi or Kurdish authorities after they have been interviewed. The officials said they did not intend to establish a long-term American facility to hold Islamic State detainees, and Obama administration officials ruled out sending any to the United States military prison at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba.One of President Obamas major objectives before he leaves office is to close Guantnamo.Captain Jeff A. Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, reiterated Tuesday that there were no plans to detain Islamic State captives long term. Any detention would be short term and coordinated with Iraqi authorities, he said.Defense Department officials say the commandos, referred to at the Pentagon as a specialized expeditionary targeting force, will almost certainly increase the intelligence on the Islamic State available to the United States, including information about current operations extracted from laptops and cellphones.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, has said the commandos are to go and scoop up paperwork and hard drives and other information that can be critical to our ongoing efforts as a central part of this strategy.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter told reporters Monday that the commando force was going strong. Its a tool that we introduced as part of the accelerated operations to conduct raids of various kinds, seizing places and people, freeing hostages and prisoners of ISIL, and making it such that ISIL has to fear that anywhere, anytime, it may be struck, Mr. Carter said.Senior Defense Department officials said the model for handling detainees seized by the new commando unit was a Delta Force raid in May, when two dozen American commandos from Iraq entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys and killed Abu Sayyaf, described by American officials as the Islamic States emir for oil and gas. Abu Sayyafs wife, Umm Sayyaf, was captured and taken to a screening facility in Iraq, where she was questioned and detained. American forces seized laptop computers, cellphones and other materials from the site.Umm Sayyaf was kept for three months by the American authorities and provided them information, officials said. Last August, she was transferred to Kurdish custody, and last month, the Justice Department filed an arrest warrant charging her with conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State in an offense that officials said resulted in the death of Kayla Mueller, the American aid worker who was killed in Syria in February 2014.Defense officials said only that the commando operation that led to the capture of the Islamic State militant was conducted in recent weeks in Iraq."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump Jr. said on Wednesday that he inadvertently gave an interview to a white nationalist radio host who has been promoting it on his website as a major exclusive that will air this weekend.The younger Mr. Trump, who goes by Don and who has been a top surrogate for his father, told Bloomberg Politics that the interview took place when the radio host in question, James Edwards, slipped onto a phone line along with someone else with whom he was speaking.The comments from Mr. Trump came after a day of uncertainty, as aides to his fathers presidential campaign said they were unaware of such an interview, particularly since Mr. Edwards said he had been at a rally for Donald J. Trump in Memphis recently, giving the impression the interview had taken place there.Mr. Edwards, host of the Political Cesspool show, said on his website that he received press credentials for a Trump rally in Memphis and had a 20-minute interview with the younger Mr. Trump, which he will air on Saturday. The show has been cited by groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for fomenting hate and promoting white ascension, as well as anti-Semitic views.On his website, Mr. Edwards showed himself in the press area at the Trump rally and also speaking with some reporters.In the Bloomberg interview, Mr. Trump said that he had been on a phone line with a different radio interviewer and that Mr. Edwards suddenly joined the conversation. He was brought into the interview without my knowledge, Mr. Trump said. Had I known, I would have obviously never done an interview with him.He added, The way the media is spinning it is as though I voluntarily spoke with this guy and I knew his background, rather than I was essentially duped by him being in the room and asking an inane question where I clearly could not have ever known what or whom I was talking to. Its very unfair, and typical of the way much of the media has handled us.The episode is the latest flap involving white nationalists for the elder Mr. Trump, who has retweeted accounts connected to white supremacists and who has been under fire for initially declining over the weekend to disavow the support of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader.Earlier Wednesday, before the younger Mr. Trumps comments, a spokeswoman for the campaign said that it did not personally vet each person applying for rally credentials and that nearly 200 people attended the Memphis rally. The spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, added: The campaign had no knowledge of his personal views and strongly condemns them. Donald Trump Jr. was not in attendance, and although he served as a surrogate for his father on several radio programs over the past week, to his knowledge and that of the campaign, did not participate in an interview with this individual.But Mr. Edwards insisted on his website that the interview took place and that he is being mistreated by the media.My show, The Political Cesspool, promotes a proud, paleoconservative Christian worldview, and we reject media descriptions of our work as white supremacist, pro-slavery and other such scare words, he wrote. As I clearly wrote in yesterdays article, in no way should anyone interpret our press credentialing and subsequent interview with Donald Trump, Jr. as any kind of endorsement by the Trump campaign."}

Now, though, its just the guest who arrives late to the party, blundering in loudly and clumsily.The series, which offers preview episodes Wednesday on ABC before settling into a regular slot on Tuesday night, gives us an Irish-Catholic family of five in Chicago. Each member has been living a lie of one sort or another. By the end of the premiere, through a series of circumstances that are supposed to be madcap but mostly just strain for laughs, everyones facade has come down and the family members face a future of living with one another as they really are.Mom (Martha Plimpton, in a thanklessly idiotic role) and Dad (Jay R. Ferguson) have been planning a divorce without their childrens knowledge. Their oldest son, Jimmy (Matt Shively), is a jock with an eating disorder. Their daughter, Shannon (Bebe Wood), has been using proceeds from her charitable fund-raising work in unorthodox, possibly illegal ways. But the biggest secret involves the younger son, Kenny (Noah Galvin). Hes gay.Shocking! Or it would be, that is, if this were still the mid-20th century. Here in the 21st, series as different as Glee and House of Lies have dealt, sensitively and smartly, with teenagers who are gay or searching for their sexual identity, and with their parents and friends reactions. On any given night, shows on CW, Freeform and other outlets give us sophisticated takes on issues that rarely crossed Ozzie and Harriets radar: sexuality, teenage pregnancy, addiction, bullying, disabilities.In this television environment, The Real ONeals feels decidedly out of phase. The Catholic League has denounced the show and Dan Savage, the sex advice columnist who drew on his childhood for the idea (hes an executive producer), but really anyone who values subtlety and sophistication in their humor is eligible to be dismayed. The mugging for the camera, especially by Mr. Galvin, is numbing, making the shows rarely funny jokes even less so. Its common for a family sitcom to assign one parent, usually the father, to the role of doofus adult, but in this series both parents are oblivious dolts, except in those final few minutes reserved for an episodes tacked-on bonding moment.None of its convincing or, more to the point, helpful. Yes, there are still plenty of closeted teenagers and plenty of parents as clueless as the two ONeals, but in 2016 that no longer seems like an occasion for lowbrow laughs."}

But the United States has refused to provide evidence to support these statements and left unanswered credible reports of civilian casualties. In my research, I found that many of those killed by the United States were civilians.

(Feb. 14) by Roger Cohen: Chancellor Angela Merkel rushed to welcome refugees and migrants with no plans on how to deal with them, leaving Italy and Greece to deal with the humanitarian emergency. Moreover, she has for years promoted unrealistic austerity measures that are suffocating any possibility of recovery and are creating millions of economic refugees (like me and my family). This is not the Europe I want for my children.Manuela Mirkos, Abu Dhabi"}
{"text": "Were going to get an extraterrestrial visitor, perhaps early next week, when asteroid 2013 TX68 zips past Earth. Theres been some agitated chatter  about just how close the speeding rock will get.What we know for sure is that it will not collide, said Sean Marshall, a Cornell University doctoral candidate who observes near-Earth asteroids. So dont panic.The size of 2013 TX68 is estimated to be 100 feet in diameter, about the size of a large yacht. This makes it slightly larger than the speeding rock that in 2013 exploded over the Russian city Chelyabinsk, damaging hundreds of buildings and injuring at least 1,500 people, mainly as windows shattered.The exact time and distance of the closest approach will not be known until after the encounter. Mr. Marshall said Tuesday that 2013 TX68 could zip through Earths ring of geostationary satellites  which orbit at a height of 22,300 miles  or travel as far away as 40 times the distance to the moon.NASAs calculations last month put the flyby at around March 8. 2013 TX68 is not on the agencys list of potentially hazardous asteroids, which come closest to Earth and are big enough to survive atmospheric re-entry and cause damage on a regional scale. Their diameters are greater than 330 feet, or about 100 meters.But the extraterrestrial rock might eventually make the hazard list if new observations made during this months close pass reveal its diameter to be larger than expected.Its possible but unlikely, Mr. Marshall said of the larger size in an interview. Still, you wouldnt want to be there if it hit. It could still wipe out a city."}
{"text": "A VILLA OVERLOOKING THE ATLANTIC IN CAPE TOWN$4.03 MILLION (65 MILLION RAND)This four-bedroom five-bath home in the beachside suburb of Clifton, on Cape Towns Atlantic seaboard, takes its design cues from Bali  airy bedroom pavilions, dark woods and stone tiling. Renovated in 2014, this 6,400-square-foot home sits on a quarter-acre on the slopes of Lions Head mountain, a short stroll from Cliftons white sand beaches.The homes open-plan living spaces are wrapped around an interior courtyard with foldaway glass doors and a retractable electric glass roof. There is a large dining room as well as a covered dining terrace facing the water. The kitchen has a walk-in cold room, bright red high-gloss lacquer cabinets and black Caesarstone countertops.All four bedrooms face the ocean and have en-suite baths. Additional features in the master suite include a sun deck, a circular, free-standing bathtub and a double rain shower.The private yard in back has a barbecue area, whirlpool and swimming pool. One wall of the pool is glass, so that when one sits in the courtyard, one looks directly into the swimming pool, said Adrien Epstein, an agent with Dogon Group Properties in Cape Town, which has the listing for the home. Other amenities include a 300-bottle wine cellar and a sauna.The home has staff accommodations consisting of a bedroom, a living area, a kitchen and a bath. The attached garage holds four cars.Clifton is renowned for its four beaches, as well as its cliffside homes and reliably turquoise-tinted water. Nearby Camps Bay is a tourist haven, with its busy beachfront strip of restaurants, shops and bars. Lions Head looms over all this beach activity, one among a chain of mountains that form Table Mountain National Park, the dramatic backdrop for Cape Town life. The mountain views are to some more stunning than the ocean, said Amanda Croker, an agent with Engel & Vlkers in Cape Town.MARKET OVERVIEWThe combination of a favorable exchange rate, a shortage of available properties (partly because of a diminishing supply of developable land) and the pleasant climate has driven up prices along Cape Towns Atlantic coast at unprecedented rates, agents say.With the downturn in the local currency, its making it very cheap for foreigners to buy, said Denise Dogon, the chief executive and founder of Dogon Group Properties.Over the last year, prices across all ranges have risen an average of 25 percent to 30 percent, with luxury apartment values escalating the most, said Laurie Wener, managing director for the Western Cape region for Pam Golding Properties, a real estate firm covering sub-Saharan Africa.The Atlantic seaboard has really become the place where people want to retire, she said. There are some very luxurious apartments to choose from with views of sea and mountains. And from an investment point of view, its a very recession-proof market. Its quite densely populated, but prices hold.While Clifton boasts some of the most expensive real estate in South Africa, with top-tier properties trading at well over 100 million rand ($6.2 million), according to Ms. Croker, other beach communities are gaining ground. For example, she said, Camps Bay broke its record sale price three times last year, with the new high now being 46 million rand, about $2.9 million.WHO BUYS IN CAPE TOWNCape Town is particularly desirable for European buyers because it can be reached via a manageable overnight flight with minimal time change. People come for just a few months or half the year  usually between September and April, the warmest months, Ms. Wener said.While foreign buyers used to be predominantly English, Irish or German, the mix has broadened to include Italians, French, Scandinavians, Swiss and Eastern Europeans, Ms. Croker said. More South Africans from outside the area are also buying along Cape Towns coast, a trend that has been helped along by the telecommuting lifestyle.As for buyers from the United States, we see the odd American, she said, but with the long haul across the date line, they are few and far between.BUYING BASICSThere are no legal restrictions on foreigners buying property in South Africa, but there is a ceiling on their borrowing ability. Nonresidents can borrow up to half of the purchase price from a local bank, so long as they can provide proof of earnings and comply with other laws aimed at curbing money laundering, according to information provided by Pam Golding Properties.The buyer pays for the lawyer, who handles the transaction for both parties. The real estate agent commission is included in the purchase price and payable by the seller.I do also recommend that my purchasers get an engineers report on any property that they are contemplating purchasing for their ease of mind, Ms. Croker said. The cost is usually 5,000 to 7,000 rand (about $310 to $430).WEBSITESTable Mountain National Park: www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/City of Cape Town official site: www.capetown.gov.zaLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Afrikaans and Xhosa, among others; South African rand (1 rand = $0.062)TAXES AND FEESThe property taxes on this listing are roughly $6,000 annually. As of March 1, the transfer duty, paid by the buyer, rose to 13 percent of the purchase price for properties about 10 million rand (about $620,000), according to Ms. Dogon. On properties priced below that, it remains 11 percent.CONTACTDenise Dogon, Dogon Group Properties, (011 27) 82 449 6608; dogongroup.com"}
