{"text": "Pop quiz: The New York City Ballet principal Robert Fairchild is dancing to the sounds of Gershwin, in choreography by Christopher Wheeldon. The title of the work contains the word American. Where are we?An American in Paris? Thats Mr. Wheeldons Tony Award-winning musical, which has starred Mr. Fairchild in the storied Gene Kelly role since it opened on Broadway last March.A reasonable assumption. But no.The scene was a New York City Ballet rehearsal room, where Mr. Fairchild was absorbing a correction from Kathleen Tracey, the rehearsal director for American Rhapsody, Mr. Wheeldons new ballet set to Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue. The dance will have its premiere at the New York City Ballets gala performance on Wednesday, alongside Mothership, a new piece by Nicolas Blanc, and Alexei Ratmanskys 2008 Concerto DSCH.Mr. Fairchild listened intently to Ms. Tracey explain that he should use his arms in a more complex way while swirling across the room. I dont know whether that is going to happen, Mr. Fairchild said. Because I cant, not because I dont want to!Until this March, when Mr. Fairchild left An American in Paris and his role as the G.I. Jerry Mulligan, to rejoin City Ballet full time, he was performing on Broadway up to eight times a week. The role earned him a Tony nomination (the musical received 12 and won in four categories) and several other awards for outstanding actor in a musical. And he became accustomed to being stopped in the street for his autograph and greeted at the stage doors by gaggles of screaming fans.While American Rhapsody repeats the winning Gershwin-Wheeldon-Fairchild combination (and its City Ballet performances will be conducted by Rob Fisher, the music director of An American in Paris), it was not conceived as a way to capitalize on the Broadway success, said Peter Martins, the companys ballet master in chief. It was Mr. Wheeldon who had suggested Rhapsody in Blue, he said when asked if City Ballet had thought this could be a way to attract audiences who might not otherwise attend the ballet. I didnt think about that at all, Mr. Martins said, although that would be nice.In a telephone conversation from Stockholm, Mr. Wheeldon, who was City Ballets resident choreographer from 2001 to 2008, said: I was really just having a love affair with Gershwins music. I dont think I was ready to let go.Its not entirely unknown for ballet-makers to cross over to Broadway: George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins are the most illustrious examples. (In his biography of Balanchine, Bernard Taper notes that it was Balanchine who asked for the Playbill credit to read choreography by, rather than dances by.)Still, Mr. Wheeldon pointed out, the fortunes of choreography had been variable on Broadway. Of course there was a wonderful era of dance, he said, but it sort of went away when the megamusicals, like Les Misrables, Miss Saigon and Phantom of the Opera came in. Twyla Tharp was the only trailblazer in between. But now shows like American in Paris and On the Town have shown there is a real appetite for serious dance.He added: It would be lovely to think that audiences of American in Paris have come away with their eyes open a little bit about ballet. They would be flabbergasted if they spent a couple of nights at City Ballet.(In an email, Karen Girty, City Ballets senior director of marketing and media wrote: In our experience, Broadway audiences at large do not cross over into ballet, but that the company was making an effort to reach that demographic through social media and publicity.)Asked why he had chosen such a well-known piece as Rhapsody in Blue, Mr. Wheeldon said that he was drawn to its grandness of scale and unconventional structure. The themes dont really resolve, they just keep on coming, which makes choreographic structure quite challenging.The ballet, which he described as a pure response to the music, has two principal couples (Mr. Fairchild and his wife, the principal dancer Tiler Peck, and Amar Ramasar and Unity Phelan) and a corps de ballet of 16. It is quite classical, although there are a few jazz-inflected movements, he said. Its hard actually, quite virtuosic, and particularly demanding on Robbie.Mr. Fairchild, who has appeared sporadically at City Ballet over the last year, said he was finding the full-time return to ballet physically difficult.There is nothing like being faced with yourself in the studio to remind you, lets get real, Mr. Fairchild said good-humoredly after the rehearsal. On Broadway, he said, he was performing the same dance steps every day, as well as acting and singing. You are at peak fitness to deliver in a particular way, but that is not the same way as being a dancer in a ballet company doing so many different ballets, all with different vocabularies and styles. At the moment, I have much less stamina for what we do here.He continued to do a ballet barre  the first part of the daily class that is an essential element of a dancers life  every day while performing in American in Paris, as well as some other physical conditioning. But, Mr. Fairchild acknowledged, he had not maintained the full training routine that he would have at City Ballet.I discovered that it was much harder to sing when I did a full ballet class, with all the turning and jumping, he explained. Your muscles do a certain thing for ballet. There has to be a certain tension and readiness in the body to spring, to jump, to turn. But singing needs the opposite, room and relaxation in the upper body so that the lungs can expand and a vibration can happen.Working to regain his stamina and full technique for City Ballet had been tough but interesting, he said. How can I have two completely different techniques of body awareness and bleed the lines a little?Mr. Wheeldon said he felt Mr. Fairchild had grown as an artist through his Broadway experience. He walks into the studio every day and there is much more of a sense of a leading man, he said. He is in command; the other dancers look up to him.Asked whether he was conscious of choreographing for a ballet audience rather than a Broadway audience, Mr. Wheeldon said it was a question of practicalities rather than expectations. You are serving a story, having to think singing, acting and a lot of scene changes. And you have to work out what can be reproduced night after night for months or years on end, how far you can physically push the dancers. There was more freedom in working purely with movement, he added, but also more fear. That blank canvas can feel very blank and very large, he said.Both men said they would like to work on Broadway again; Mr. Fairchild will have another stab at his role when An American in Paris opens in London in 2017. But both also spoke of their pleasure in returning to pure dance.Both worlds are amazing, Mr. Fairchild said, and I love the crossover thing that has happened. When someone came to me and said they had seen American in Paris eight times and had just bought their first ticket to City Ballet, I was so thrilled. He grinned. Pressure. Id better live up to that."}
{"text": "One of Shakespeares wildest yarns, Pericles, receives an extremely imaginative production that delivers plenty of freewheeling entertainment at Two River Theater in Red Bank.The Jacobean stage equivalent of a road movie, Pericles propels its princely title figure on journeys all over the eastern Mediterranean for more than 15 years: escaping assassination, enduring storms at sea, gallantly jousting to win the love of his life, tragically losing his wife, Thaisa, and experiencing other woes and adventures.A similarly improbable secondary plot involving Marina, Pericless brilliant daughter, is by turns perilous, droll and finally affecting with its happy conclusion of reunions that is, if not completely miraculous, at least divinely inspired.Thought to be a partial collaboration with another writer, and first performed around 1608, Pericles is said to have been hugely popular in its day. Because of its appeal, unauthorized versions were published; by the time Pericles was added to a collected edition of Shakespeares works in 1664, the original manuscript had been lost and only the so-called corrupt texts had survived. Ever since, scholars and makers of theater have cobbled together different versions.What might be among the most radical incarnations of Pericles so far now brightens the Two River stage, where Rinde Eckert, a songwriter and performer, and David Schweizer, a director long known for staging offbeat works, have reshaped Shakespeares episodic odyssey into an enjoyable romp, with music. They have sharply edited the play, added more than 20 songs and maximized the talents of a seven-member cast, most of whom portray multiple characters.A note in the program describes the shows present-day location as a dive bar at the end of the world. Caleb Wertenbaker, the scenic designer, aptly furnishes a rundown saloon with whimsical bric-a-brac and peeling walls. Lounging upon a little bandstand, a couple musicians listlessly noodle a tune. Sitting among the scattered tables, half a dozen drinkers gaze into nothingness.Into these bleary environs strides the imposing figure of Mr. Eckert in the person of Gower, the shaggy poet who narrates Pericles. Strumming a banjo ukulele, Mr. Eckert launches into a rhythmic musical invocation which galvanizes the others into joining him to perform this tale of lust and love.As the action kicks off under Mr. Schweizers confident direction, a scruffy customer assumes the noble bearing of Pericles, even as the neighboring barflies morph into other characters alongside him.Throughout the performance, everyday objects and extraneous bits of clothing are smartly used in the transformative process: the stringy head of a mop turns a busboy into an incestuous princess; plastic lobster bibs and badminton rackets deck out the neglectful rulers of a starving nation; sheets of aluminum foil transmogrify into armor. And so it goes for a little more than two swiftly-paced hours, even as the actors expertly lend different voices, accents and physical qualities to the characters they portray.Philippe Bowgen earnestly depicts the young Pericles, who falls in love with Nikki Massouds dreamy Thaisa. (A sweet moment of intimacy arises when they each blow into a white balloon that symbolizes Thaisas pregnancy.) Midway through the saga, Ms. Massoud reappears as the forthright Marina, the couples intrepid daughter, whose blazing virtue melts down a bordello.With her clarion voice and keen comedic sense, Mary Testa is an especially vivid member of the troupe, which also features Kevin Mambo, J. Clint Allen and Ellen Harvey, all of whom capably act and sing.Mr. Eckert (who plays Pericles in his later years) provides a percussive and agreeably bluesy score that throbs with emotion and grows cacophonous during the storm scenes, but more often than not swings easily, as when a wacky trio of rhyme-challenged pirates relieves an implausible plot point with wit.A motley array of costumes designed by Gabriel Berry and Christopher Akerlinds sharply-cued lighting design enhance the playful charm of the music, staging and performances. Some characters and scenes have been shortened to accommodate the songs, but they will scarcely be missed. Slimmed down and tuned up, this Pericles is Shakespeare freshly served with a twist, a perfect tonic for a modern audience."}

{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised just $25.8 million for his campaign in April, down by more than 40 percent from the previous month, as he faces an increasingly narrow path in the race for the Democratic nomination for president.The April total, released by his campaign on Sunday, brought Mr. Sanderss cumulative fund-raising haul to $210 million from more than 2.4 million donors.He raised almost $46 million in March, his best month yet in a contest duringwhich he has frequently brought in more money thanhis Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.Earlier this week, Mr. Sanders revealed in an interview that he would be laying off some 255 workers, saying he would focus his resources on competing in the remaining 14 contests, particularly in California.Mr. Sanders has faced questions about how much he can continue to raise as Mrs. Clinton has pulled farther ahead in the competition for Democratic delegates. But he is continuing to bring in large sums of money from donors making small gifts: 540,000 people contributed in April, the campaign said.What our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said in a statement. Four in 10 contributors are between 18 and 39 years old and the most common professions of donorsare teachers, students and engineers, the statement said.Seeking to minimize the drop in fund-raising, the campaigns spokesman, Michael Briggs, stressed that Mr. Sanderss average monthly fund-raising total was only $17 million. But that factors in Mr. Sanderss fund-raising going back a full year to the start of his campaign."}
{"text": "Our top-heavy economy has come to this: One man can move out of New Jersey and put the entire state budget at risk. Other states are facing similar situations as a greater share of income  and tax revenue  becomes concentrated in the hands of a few.Last month, during a routine review of New Jerseys finances, one could sense the alarm. The states wealthiest resident had reportedly shifted his personal and business domicile to another state, Frank W. Haines III, New Jerseys legislative budget and finance officer, told a State Senate committee. If the news were true, New Jersey would lose so much in tax revenue that we may be facing an unusual degree of income tax forecast risk, Mr. Haines said.The New Jersey resident (unnamed by Mr. Haines) is the hedge-fund billionaire David Tepper. In December, Mr. Tepper declared himself a resident of Florida after living for over 20 years in New Jersey. He later moved the official headquarters of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, to Miami.New Jersey wont say exactly how much Mr. Tepper paid in taxes. But according to Institutional Investors Alpha, he earned more than $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Tax experts say his move to Florida could cost New Jersey  which has a top tax rate of 8.97 percent  hundreds of millions of dollars in lost payments.Mr. Tepper, 58, declined to comment on his move. He does have family  his mother and sister  who live in Florida. But several New Jersey lawmakers cited his relocation as proof that the states tax rates, up from 6.37 percent in 1996, are chasing away the rich. Florida has no personal income tax.If youre making hundreds of millions of dollars and youre paying close to 10 percent to the state of New Jersey, you do the math, said Jon Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey Assembly. You can save millions a year by moving to Florida. How can you blame him?Beyond the debate on taxing the rich, Mr. Teppers move is a case study in how tax collections are affected when income becomes very highly concentrated. With the top tenth of 1 percent of the population reaping the largest income gains, states with the highest tax rates on the rich are growing increasingly dependent on a smaller group of superearners for tax revenue.In New York, California, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey, the top 1 percent pay a third or more of total income taxes. Now a handful of billionaires or even a single individual like Mr. Tepper can have a noticeable impact on state revenues and budgets.California had to account for a Facebook effect in 2012 and 2013 after that companys 2012 initial public offering of stock. The offering generated more than $1 billion in revenue  much of that from the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small group of company shareholders. Washington, D.C., had an unexpected $50 million gain in its 2012 fiscal year  which helped create a budget surplus  after the death of a local billionaire increased its estate tax receipts.Some academic research shows that high taxes are chasing the rich to lower-tax states, and anecdotes of tax-fleeing billionaires abound. But other studies say there is little evidence showing that the rich move solely for tax purposes. Millionaires and billionaires who move from the high-tax states in the Northeast to Florida, for instance, may be drawn by the sunshine, lifestyle and retirement culture, in addition to lower taxes.While some high earners may be moving for tax reasons, New Jersey, New York, California and other states are replacing rich people faster than they are losing them. New Jersey had 237,000 millionaires in 2015, compared with 207,200 in 2006, according to Phoenix Marketing International, a research firm. New York added 69,500 millionaires from 2006 to 2015, to 437,900, while California added over 100,000 millionaires, to 772,600.The best solution to the mega-taxpayer dilemma, some tax experts say, is for states to do a better job of tracking and forecasting the incomes of their top earners. Since the rich are the most mobile and are able to manage their investments just as easily in Miami as in Manhattan, states are devising new ways to monitor their top taxpayers and keep them from leaving.In a time of rising inequality, Im not sure the right answer is lowering taxes or making them less progressive, said Kim S. Rueben, senior fellow of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Its more about keeping an eye on people, seeing where they are and enforcing the tax rules.Connecticut, home to several hedge fund billionaires, now tracks the quarterly estimated payments of 100 of its top earners. Kevin B. Sullivan, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, said about five or six of the highest earners could have a measurable impact on the revenue stream.Mr. Sullivan said that when one of the states rich hedge fund executives planned to move his family and company to a lower-tax state, state officials met with him and persuaded him to leave some of his work force in Connecticut.We knew we were going to lose him, Mr. Sullivan said. But we wanted to keep some of the higher-paying jobs. He said the state worked out a deal to keep the jobs in exchange for an agreement about the owners regular visits to family and friends in Connecticut. (Homeowners who spend more than 183 days in the state are considered residents for tax purposes.) He said the state was holding discussions with other top earners in hopes of keeping them.Im not saying were sending fruit baskets and get-well cards, said Mr. Sullivan, a former Democratic legislator. But were trying to send a more welcoming message to the high earners as a group.New York is now more closely monitoring wealthy taxpayers who have homes in New York but claim Florida as their tax residence. And New Jersey is collecting data on all of the taxpayers who make more than $1 million to forecast their tax payments more accurately.In California, 5,745 taxpayers earning $5 million or more generated more than $10 billion of income taxes in 2013, or about 19 percent of the states total, according to state officials.Any state that depends on income taxes is going to get sick whenever one of these guys gets a cold, Mr. Sullivan said.Hence New Jerseys concern over Mr. Teppers departure. Whatever the reasons for his move, he is leaving for Florida at an especially opportune time for tax savings. Many hedge fund managers have for years used a tax loophole that allowed them to defer taxes on fees they earned through the use of offshore funds. A 2008 federal tax rule, however, requires them to declare those fees by the end of 2017 and pay any necessary federal, state and local taxes.For some hedge fund managers, the amounts declared will probably be in the billions of dollars, accountants say. A spokesman for Mr. Tepper declined to comment on his overseas income. By moving to Florida, Mr. Tepper could avoid paying state income taxes on any such funds.If hes bringing money back, youre talking about a big possible gain, Mr. Bramnick said. So its a good time to move to Florida.Mr. Tepper regularly topped state wealth rankings as New Jerseys richest resident. He also has homes in Miami Beach and the Hamptons. In 2012 and 2013, he also topped Alphas list of the highest-earning hedge fund managers, with estimated earnings of $2.2 billion in 2012 and $3.5 billion in 2013. His earnings fell to $400 million in 2014.Mr. Tepper never publicly announced his move to Florida. But it became public on April 5, when Mr. Haines, citing a Bloomberg report, mentioned Mr. Teppers move in his remarks to the State Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. In discussing the move, Mr. Haines said, Even a 1 percent forecasting error in the income tax estimate is worth $140 million.Mr. Teppers payments may have even been higher. If Mr. Tepper earned $3.5 billion in 2013, his state tax bill could have been over $300 million, according to New Jersey accountants. Granted, his actual payments were probably far lower because of deferred income, charitable deductions and other accounting treatments. Yet Mr. Hainess comments are believed to be the first time a state official has warned of a budget risk because of one residents relocation.Weve had states mention risks from high-income groups, but never from a single taxpayer, Ms. Rueben of the Tax Policy Center said."}

{"text": "RE: MINECRAFTClive Thompson wrote about the vast and expanding world of the popular computer game that is teaching millions of children to master the digital world.While pointing out the admirable similarities between block play and Minecraft (each of which provides opportunities for creative problem solving, computational thinking and the development of civic literacy), Clive Thompson does not acknowledge the major and undesirable differences. A computer game can never capture the sensations of working with real materials, in this case, the weight, texture, grain and smell of wood. Even the online human interactions are often one step removed from actual people and address a limited range of social and emotional issues.Technology has its place, but as a developmental psychologist, I believe that the disproportionate amount of time that children today spend in front of screens deprives them of direct experience with the rest of the physical and interpersonal world. Leading a meaningful life and benefiting society require more than a generation of adept coders. I wish the article presented a more balanced perspective. Ann S. Epstein, Ann Arbor, Mich.For an adult, the only thing more boring and baffling than Minecraft is listening to your kid talk about Minecraft. (My kids are 8 and 4.)Which is why I enjoyed the Minecraft article, because it made me rethink  grudgingly, yes, but miraculously, considering the depth of my loathing  my attitude toward Minecrack. Its no longer an awful, ugly, pointless time-suck of a game with no objective and no reward; now its an awful, ugly, computer-programming game with social elements and logic puzzles, which will help set my daughter and son up for successful futures! Right! Yes! Im going to go with that from now on. Lydia Markoff, San Jose, Calif.RE: DONALD TRUMPJeff Sharlet considered Donald Trump as a preacher of the prosperity gospel whose success is based largely on the power to persuade people that his story can be theirs.Jeff Sharlets article is unfair to the writings of Norman Vincent Peale and his book The Power of Positive Thinking. Sharlet implies that Peales book deals in the kind of anger, bitterness and financial and personal entitlement that the writer believes characterizes Trumps campaign. But Peales book does not extol greed, does not support any form of hatred and is not about superficial magical thinking. It merely gives suggestions on how you can make an unpredictable and often deeply painful life on earth more successful, comfortable and joyful. There are no shallow guarantees in it, no self-indulgent pronouncements of personal power. The book is straightforward, unpretentious and smart; compassionate, contemporary and useful. It is better than the articles assessment of it, and yes, better than Trump. It is worth rereading, or reading for the first time. Scott Klavan, the BronxHighly influenced by Norman Vincent Peales 1952 best seller, The Power of Positive Thinking, Donald Trump, Jeff Sharlet wrote, doesnt reject faith. Instead, he returns it to the roots of Christian business conservatism.The lust for success and wealth, however, directly contradicts the Christian New Testament, which favors the weak and the poor and condemns the wealthy and the pursuit of wealth. Actually, many of Trumps followers dont even think in terms of great wealth but rather yearn for just a decent job. Their sense of powerlessness is palpable. Trump himself gave them a clue concerning the real problem: The political class, which the Republicans love to attack, he declared, is actually a mere puppet to the wealthy. However, Trumps followers ignore the implications, the reality of class domination  and instead focus on a magnetic, messianic personality. Theyll need a lot of luck. Roger Carasso, Santa Fe, N.M."}
{"text": "CONNECTOGRAPHYMapping the Future of Global CivilizationBy Parag KhannaIllustrated. 466 pp. Random House. $30.To understand where Parag Khanna is coming from with Connectography, you have to start with his acknowledgments. He recognizes the assistance he received from a plethora of institutions spanning four continents. Khanna thanks the National University of Singapore, the Q Symposium at the University of Sydney, the New America Foundation, the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation, the London School of Economics, Zurich Insurance, the New Cities Foundation and McKinsey & Company. That is impressive, but not as impressive as the 400 or so people he thanks for helping him with this book about everything. Parag Khanna may well be the most connected man alive.Connectography represents Khannas latest effort to arbitrage his personal networking skills into a theory of geopolitics. He is interested in how connectivity and geography will affect the future of global affairs, and he makes his thesis clear in the first few pages: We are moving into an era where cities will matter more than states and supply chains will be a more important source of power than militaries  whose main purpose will be to protect supply chains rather than borders. Competitive connectivity is the arms race of the 21st century. He spends the rest of this book attempting to demonstrate that connectivity is destiny, taking the reader from the steppes of Mongolia to the streets of Detroit to the shimmering spires of Dubai.Trying to assess a Khanna book is something of a challenge. Four years ago in The New Republic, Evgeny Morozov wrote the most scathing review I have ever read. It was of an e-book written by Parag Khanna and his wife, Ayesha Khanna. Morozov devoted thousands of words eviscerating the Khannas approach as the apotheosis of slick ahistorical jeremiads on geopolitics. Rereading Morozov, I still wince at the venom. And yet Khannas brand of globaloney, with phrases like Its time to reimagine how human life is organized on Earth, seems to invite this kind of response. He describes himself as a leading global strategist on his website, which is one of those cool-sounding titles that dont mean much when you think about them.To be more charitable than Morozov, I would say there is a thin and interesting essay nestled inside the enormous pile of fluff that is Connectography. In that essay, Khanna could have honed his case for continued economic openness at a time when tribalism is on the rise. In a world of super-low interest rates, Khanna correctly infers that it is in every governments interest to invest more heavily in the infrastructure that enhances connectivity. This could take the form of physical infrastructure like roads and airports, or online infrastructure to facilitate data flows, or financial hubs to coax cross-border investment. Developed countries facing demographic crunches should be far more welcoming of migration flows from the developing world. Khanna might even be on to something in talking about the enhanced role that cities will play in 21st-century governance.But the fluff is voluminous. Khanna and his editors clearly believe that his prose style is a winning one, but for this reader it was like struggling through the transcription of a TED talk on a recursive loop. Take, for example, what he means by connectivity. Its not the most elegant of words, but an intelligent reader can quickly divine its meaning. Khanna does not leave the term alone, however. He describes connectivity as a mega-pattern, a world-historical idea and an impulse  all in the span of a single paragraph.Once you get past the prose, the inchoate nature of Khannas ideas is even more troubling. When he writes about international relations, he makes much of the Great Supply Chain War that will redraw 21st-century maps as much as the Thirty Years War did in the 17th century. Khanna argues that the more embedded a country is in these global supply chains, the more power and influence it exercises. In his words, today power derives from leverage exercised through connective reach.As China discovered when it tried to use its near monopoly of rare earths to pressure Japan six years ago, however, producer leverage is extremely limited. China was able to employ this form of belligerent statecraft once. Ever since, its share of that market has dwindled. The same is true of other commodity exporters that Khanna extols. In a world where commodity prices are sagging and governments are falling over each other to improve their connectivity, the strategic value of any individual connection or source of supply erodes. The more China expands its Silk Road initiatives, the less the Strait of Malacca matters. Khanna himself acknowledges this point. Indeed, Khanna demonstrates the rare ability in Connectography to contradict himself in the span of a single sentence: Devolution-aggregation is how the world comes together by falling apart.More generally, Khanna radically overestimates producer power and underestimates financial power. This might be because, like many based in Singapore, Khanna treats China as a country that can do no wrong and the United States as a country that can do no right. Nevertheless, it leads to strange moments in the text, like his insistence that financial sanctions against Iran had no appreciable effect.What is particularly odd is that Khanna believes he is evincing a savvy worldview and yet offers a utopian vision of connectivitys effect on people. He insists that the forces of connection will overwhelm the forces of division. In the books most blas sentence, Khanna argues that the virtues of tolerance and coexistence will come to the Middle East through a combination of to each his own cartographic remapping and supply chain interdependence. I would gently suggest that there will be a very long and very violent stretch between the current Middle East and Khannas placid vision  and that its the bumpy part that is salient right now.Whats more, Connectography is a victim of awful timing. It argues that territory and borders do not matter just when Russia has annexed Crimea and extended its influence in Ukraine, and when China is changing facts on the ground in the South China Sea. Khanna argues that the European Union is a template for managing the simultaneous forces of integration and devolution, though Europe today is beset with economic stagnation, xenophobic backlash against refugees, ascendant far-right parties and a possible Brexit. Khanna wants to use the global supply chain to explain the world. However, the McKinsey Global Institute reports that global flows as a percentage of output have fallen from 53 percent in 2007 to 39percent in 2014  in no small part because of the cost of managing complex, lengthy supply chains. It is possible that in a few years, these trends will reverse themselves, but Khanna offers no explanation as to how.I wish that Khanna were right about the power of connectivity. The world would be a better place. I fear, however, that he does not know what he is talking about."}

Ive got to tell you, Im getting really tired of saying that. Weve already chatted on Facebook Live this week. We keep up a regular banter on Slack and Twitter. And then theres this newsletter, week in and week out. Youre a nice guy, but  dont you think were just too involved?Mike: Is this you trying to break up with me? Dont ever leave me, Farhad. Im too fragile.Farhad: Er, lets just talk about tech news. It was another big week for corporate earnings. Lets summarize: Apple made $10.5 billion in three months, which would be a record for just about any other company on the planet, but for Apple it was an embarrassing comedown from its year-ago peak. Now people are wondering whether Apples best days are in its past. Hey, whose arent, am I right?Mike: My mom says my best days are ahead of me. But she also said I was the coolest kid in school which, uh, turned out to be a slight exaggeration.Farhad: Twitter also disappointed investors: The company added some new users, but it fell short of revenue projections, sending people on Twitter into a panic. Amazon, meanwhile, crushed it. The companys sales grew 28 percent, and it posted a profit of $513 million, a record for Amazon. For those keeping score at home: Thats about what Apple makes every four days. Amazons stock went predictably nuts.Mike: Man, what if your job was looking at how much companies profit margins grew or shrank every day? Just thinking of being surrounded by Excel spreadsheets and punching in figures makes me want to cry.Farhad: While were on the boring subject of earnings, lets note some recent boardroom shuffles. So Yahoo  remember them? Used to be kind of famous  gave in to one of its fiercest tormentors this week: the hedge fund Starboard Value, often described as an activist investor. Yahoo allowed Starboard to have four seats on its board, a way to ease some tensions in advance of a potential sale of Yahoos core bus oh, my God, Im bored already. Anyway, thats the Yahoo update.Mike: Holy moly, I am bored out of my mind. I need a place to sleep now.Farhad: Funny you should say that! Arianna Huffington, the founder of the Huffington Post and the author of a new book about sleep, has joined the board of Uber. Also, the Huffington Post recently killed a story critical of Uber. Coincidence, Im sure.Mike: Maybe she can tell me the best way to sleep in an Uber. Shes willing to join us on rides, apparently.Farhad: Maybe we should chat about Facebook? Mark Zuckerbergs social behemoth announced huge growth and profits this week, beating out even the most optimistic of analysts expectations. Zuck also announced his intention to become a kind of world-historic deity, creating a new stock structure that would allow him to give away his money so that he can do things like  I kid you not, this is a real goal, written down on paper and everything  cure all diseases by the end of this century.So you cover Facebook. Tell me, why are they doing so well? More important, can anything stop them?Mike: I think we talked a little bit about this in our Facebook Live discussion this week. (Tune in every week!) Its an important thing to highlight, so lets dive in again.For one, we cannot stress enough just how well Facebook handled the broad consumer shift from using a desktop computer to get to the web to now using smartphones as our gateways to pretty much everything on the Internet. The entire industry was caught off guard by the success of iPhone and Android, and absolutely no one was prepared for how to make money on the phone.That killed  or at least deeply wounded  quite a few successful companies. Remember Zynga? That place was raking in the cash from FarmVille-loving moms on the desktop. Suddenly, everyone is playing Candy Crush Saga on the iPhone and all those cash crops are lying fallow. Zynga still hasnt recovered or found a viable way out.Anyway, Facebook nailed mobile ads in the news feed, and now 82 percent of the companys ad revenue comes from people viewing those ads on smartphones. Thats a shift in just a few years, and its insane.Farhad: Its all the more remarkable considering how unlikely the transition looked a few years ago. Just after the companys I.P.O. in 2012, investors were almost universally convinced that Facebook couldnt get people hooked on its app the way it had seduced us on desktops. And analysts were constantly sounding an alarm that Facebook was just a fad  Teenagers Leaving Facebook! became an evergreen tech headline  and everyone was constantly on the lookout for the next great social network.Facebook endured, I think, because it understood that its appeal was primal and wasnt dependent on format: People wanted to see what was going on with their friends and frenemies from whatever device they used. Kind of like how you and I cant stop chatting no matter what machine were on.Mike: Yes, isnt it great? Now, Facebook gets to make all these huge bets on the future to figure out where the next enormous platform for consumers will be and really try to dominate that long before its backed into a corner and forced to.No one puts Zuck in the corner, ever again.That means huge gambles on acquiring start-ups like Oculus, the virtual reality company, and WhatsApp, the messaging app, for billions upon billions of dollars.Im nervous to give Facebook too much in the way of props, only because its already a lovefest with analysts and what goes up must eventually come down. I think Isaac Newton said that. Or Gordon Gekko.Farhad: Yeah, I dont think we should go overboard. Their bets on the future still face huge questions: Can WhatsApp ever make money? Will Facebook Messenger really become a place for commerce and services? Will virtual reality become entrenched in society, or could it end up as the next 3-D TV? And then theres the biggest vulnerability: Will the new Farhad and Mike Facebook Live show convince people to delete Facebook forever?Mike: Ive got people unfriending me after that show already  99 percent of the comments were insults.Anyway, for now, Facebook is still the company to beat. I guess they get to keep taking victory laps.Farhad: Not for long, friend. Were doing another Facebook video next week. Thatll show them. See you then!"}
{"text": "THE national tourism agency calls the Mexican mountain town of Angangueo a Pueblo Mgico. If so, it is a dark magic.In recent years, Angangueos 5,000 inhabitants have been cursed by calamities natural and manufactured. Snowstorms, mudslides and flash floods have terrorized the town. Hulking piles of mine tailings line the main road, barren reminders of the silver, gold and copper mining that petered out a quarter-century ago after defining the community for 200 years.Even the monarch butterflies that are the focus of the magic town tourism campaign are suffering. Millions still roost on nearby mountains, a wintertime spectacle that attracts the visitors from El Norte who are the towns economic lifeline. But the overwintering population of monarchs has fallen by almost two-thirds over the past dozen years, and this years better-than-usual aggregation was abruptly devastated in March by another freak snowstorm, the worst in years.Now those monarchs are facing another potential calamity. One of Mexicos largest corporations is close to winning government approval to reopen a sprawling mine in Angangueo, right next to the most important winter habitat of North Americas most iconic insect. In a region where butterfly tourism isnt doing much to ease pervasive poverty, the mining proposal has plenty of local support, even as it alarms biologists.I spent a few days recently in Angangueo, about 75 miles west of Mexico City, doing research for a book about monarchs. Many people know the outlines of their plight: Monarchs are under extreme pressure from climate change, deforestation in Mexico and the elimination of milkweed  almost the only food monarch caterpillars will eat  from Midwestern farm fields (hastened by the use of genetically modified corn and soybeans).At risk is one of the most wondrous migrations on earth, where tens of millions of monarchs, each weighing only about as much as a paper clip, flutter south from Canada and the northern United States for as far as 3,000 miles. Catching rides on thermal air currents, they cross mountains and deserts, somehow arriving at the same forested mountainsides in south-central Mexico where their great-great-grandparents spent the previous winter.But even amid so much public concern about monarchs, very few people are aware that Mexicos largest mining conglomerate, Grupo Mxico, wants to use a legal loophole to revive mining in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a protected region where most industrial activity is supposed to be banned, said Felipe Martnez Meza, the acting director of the reserve.Amazingly, the Mexican environmental authorities and a global conservation group that has an active program in the reserve have said almost nothing publicly about the proposal, which local scientists say poses a clear threat to the beleaguered butterflies. The plan also raises difficult questions about whats best for the long suffering people of Angangueo, where jobs are so scarce that on some mornings the mere rumor that the shuttered mine might need a few temporary laborers generates a stampede to the mines front gate  all for the privilege of earning about $8 for a long shift pumping water out of cramped, dank tunnels.Grupo Mxico has already gotten most of the permits it needs to reopen the mine, but is still negotiating with the Mexican government over an ore-processing plant it needs. The company argues that it should be allowed to go forward because the mine never technically closed, and thus predates the creation of the biosphere reserve and its accompanying restrictions, Mr. Martnez said.The proposal is avidly supported by Angangueos local government and most of its residents, who would benefit most directly from the low-wage jobs the mine would bring  at first a few hundred jobs, and ultimately perhaps several thousand.Elsewhere in the region, however, many are wary. Silvestre Chvez Snchez, the elected leader of another community near the monarch reserve, told me, We know that no mining project in Mexico has ever brought lasting development for local people, but has always had problems associated with natural resource destruction.Grupo Mxicos track record is not encouraging. In 2014, a huge copper mine it operates in the northern state of Sonora was the site of one of the worst environmental disasters in Mexican history. About 10 million gallons of toxic copper sulfate acid breached a dam at the mine and spilled into two rivers that supply water to more than 24,000 people.In Angangueo, Grupo Mxico wants to process up to 1,200 tons of ore daily, and says it will do so in an environmentally sensitive way, said Mara Isabel Ramrez, a geographer who studies monarchs at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Morelia. But the company has been frustratingly vague on some key issues, including how much water and acid will be needed to extract copper, zinc, lead, silver and gold from all that ore, and where the resulting waste will be dumped. Nor has Grupo Mxico fully explained where and how it plans to expand the old tunnel network that snakes beneath nearby mountains  the same mountains where monarchs roost every winter.Ms. Ramrez worries that the huge volumes of water used by the mine will dry up mountain springs and threaten the viability of the oyamel fir trees where the butterflies roost. We have many concerns about it, she said, noting that the firs are already stressed by climate change and illegal logging, which persists despite years of efforts to stop it.You might think that the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, which operates an active program within the reserve, would be leading the opposition. But the organization, which actively seeks corporate contributions, has been quiet so far, though the W.W.F.s chief local representative gave me a blunt assessment. My professional and personal position, W.W.F. aside, is that opening up the mine could have terrible implications ecologically and economically, said Eduardo Rendn-Salinas, who heads W.W.F.-Mexicos Monarch Butterfly Program.The W.W.F. and other nonprofits, with some support from the Mexican government, are trying to develop alternate economic models for the region based on ecotourism, sustainable farming and logging, and native crafts, but funding has been limited and progress slow in a region where poverty is all but inescapable. The mine proposal, by contrast, offers a faster route  but to where, exactly? As Mr. Martnez told me: It will provide work for a small group of people, but the cost may not be worth the benefit. We feel strongly that something like this may be catastrophic for the reserve.In Angangueo, memories are still fresh from the last catastrophe: the floods of 2010, when three days of heavy rain and hail produced mud slides and caused the local river to overrun its banks. After hours of gradual flooding, something suddenly gave way  no one is sure what  and sent a wall of water hurtling down the towns main street. At least 30 people were killed, and hundreds were left homeless. Some locals blamed the honeycomb of mine tunnels above the town, but an official investigation absolved the mine and blamed the heavy rain  just another calamity for a community that has endured so much for so long."}
{"text": "THE MIDNIGHT WATCHA Novel of the Titanic and the CalifornianBy David Dyer323 pp. St. Martins Press. $26.99.Tonights watch will be an easy one for you, with nothing much to do. So says the captain of the S.S. Californian to his second officer near the beginning of David Dyers moody and engrossing new novel. But how wrong he is. The first four hours of April 15, 1912  the midnight watch of Dyers title  will turn out to be the most troubling of their lives. Even as the captain speaks those words, one of the iconic disasters of modern history is unfolding within sight of the Californians foredeck: The R.M.S. Titanic is sinking, just miles from a ship that could possibly rescue all her passengers and crew, and yet the Californian does nothing.Unlikely as it may seem, this incident is not something Dyer has invented. In the vast literature of commentary about the real Titanic disaster, no puzzle is more baffling than that of the Californians inaction on that cold and calm night. Over the space of an hour or so, at least three of the Californians crew saw the distant ship fire off a series of white rockets  a widely recognized distress signal. And yet Capt. Stanley Lord, despite being told of the rockets, never gave an order to steam closer to investigate, or even to wake the wireless operator so he could radio a query. Instead, the captain merely went back to sleep in the ships chartroom, while Second Officer Herbert Stone fretted ineffectually above decks and over 1,500 people died in the frigid North Atlantic waters just a short cruise away.In The Midnight Watch, Dyer  a self-professed Titanic obsessive  tries to imagine his way to a satisfactory explanation for this behavior, something that official inquiries on both sides of the Atlantic failed to provide. Judging by my spot checks against the online Encyclopedia Titanica (yes, such a thing exists, and it is voluminous), he has been thoroughly faithful to the facts, often lifting quotations and other details directly from the historical record. Nearly all his characters are documented figures who speak and act in the novel much as they apparently did in real life. The principal exception is John Steadman, a fictional reporter for an actual newspaper, The Boston American, who becomes consumed by the Californian episode and spends years trying to unlock its secrets. Novelists typically object when reviewers identify individual characters too closely with their creator, but Steadman, whose chapters are the only ones told in the first person, is clearly the authors surrogate, his proxy for a tireless investigation into how such negligence could possibly have occurred.John Steadman is The Boston Americans so-called body man, the staff journalist responsible for investigating the personal lives of victims of high-profile disasters. Having earned praise for his sensitive portrayals of the young women who died in the infamous 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, he now hopes to repeat the favor for the casualties from this latest tragedy. Acting on a report that the Californian is heading to Boston with a cargo of recovered corpses from the Titanic, he sets out to rendezvous with the ship before it berths at the East Boston piers. But although Steadman quickly learns that there are no bodies aboard (the Californian briefly searched for victims after the sinking but found none), he becomes intrigued by Captain Lords impatient and evasive answers to questions about the Californians role in the drama. There was a story on this ship, the reporter tells himself. I could smell it.Steadman pursues that story through the rest of the novel, following its trail from Boston to Washington, D.C., to Liverpool and beyond, refusing to let it go, even after losing his job for neglecting to provide the kind of colorful, sensational coverage his editor demands. But Steadman is preoccupied with a subtler question  what was it that prevented Lord and his crew from going to the aid of a ship that was obviously in trouble? The captain himself provides little insight, arrogantly maintaining (against all logic and evidence to the contrary) that the ship he saw on the horizon that night was not the Titanic, and that the rockets later reported to him were not distress signals. But the more forthcoming account given by Second Officer Stone  a shy and tentative man with a delicate sensitivity  is hardly more enlightening. Unlike Lord, who is clearly stonewalling, the second officer seems legitimately incapable of articulating why they both failed to grasp the import of those fireworks. I just thought they were white rockets, Stone testifies at one point. That is all.Dyer does eventually suggest a kind of explanation for what happened aboard the Californian that night, though it may not satisfy readers looking for a clear-cut solution. Ultimately, the amorphous character of the midnight watch itself may provide the only interpretation that makes any rough sense. The midnight-till-4 shift, as one character describes it, is a time of loneliness, demons and trances. Call it the peacetime equivalent of the fog of war. In history, as in fiction, some matters  even after all the knowable facts have emerged  seem destined to remain mysterious."}

They both came from single-mother households, she said. They had to help their moms take care of the other kids. They had this added maturity that already marks the New York City teenager.That experience became the seed for The After School Project, Ms. Giraldos continuing Instagram series documenting how students, mostly in Brooklyn, all in public schools, spend the interlude between school and home. Her parameters for the project, which was a finalist for the inaugural Getty Images Instagram Grant last year, were loose.Im trying to capture these kids at their most authentic time, she said. Theyre not being watched by their teachers and parents. She photographed them playing sports, or just hanging out. Ive experienced after-school time as this lighthearted time, she said. Its great to run into the same kids time and time again. I see how the girlfriend or boyfriend from about a week ago is no longer the girlfriend or boyfriend.Now studying education reporting at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, Ms. Giraldo has learned more about the institutions teenagers navigate. She plans to turn the project into a website for students and educators  and to check in with her former subjects April and Desire, who are about to graduate from high school.

{"text": "I am perched on a slippery roof ridge at the Buffalo Peaks Ranch in the rain, feet sliding on ancient asphalt shingles atop rotting plywood decking, tethered only by a rope. For fun.With me on the roof are five other volunteers who are donating their time and brawn to create a live-in rural library in Colorado, helping the booksellers Jeff Lee and Ann Martin realize their dream.In the course of their 20 years at the independent Denver bookstore Tattered Cover, Mr. Lee and Ms. Martin have accumulated more than 32,000 volumes on the American West (my first novel, Stations West, is among them). Seeking to share the books, and their love of Colorado, the pair, who are married, have leased the Buffalo Peaks Ranch, about two hours from Denver, to house their collection.But before the property, which they are calling the Rocky Mountain Land Library, can become a haven for lovers of the West and Western literature, it must be restored. A working ranch from 1862 until the mid-1980s, the buildings at Buffalo Peaks have fallen into disrepair. Enter HistoriCorps, a service organization dedicated to historical preservation.Various funding sources and grants supply materials and professional help, but volunteers like me make up the bulk of the work force. Last summer, in addition to Buffalo Peaks Ranch, HistoriCorps volunteers worked on preserving former slave quarters in Virginia, an archaeology museum and field school in Michigan, and a mining town in Colorado, among other projects.The ranch currently consists of four dilapidated and waterlogged residential buildings and two enormous, sun-dappled barns for horses, cattle and sheep, now the residences of birds and rodents. There are two tasks at hand  we HistoriCorps volunteers are to strip the bunkhouse of its asphalt shingles, shore up the roof and reshingle it. We are also to reshingle the much steeper and higher cookhouse with historically accurate cedar shingles.The first morning, I arrive in my brand-new work pants, expecting a gaggle of aging hippies, but my fellow volunteers are 20- and 30-somethings, as new to construction as I am. (My previous building experience consists of a semi-failed attempt to put together a futon with an Allen wrench, and I once wielded a hammer to hang a photo.)Our patient project supervisor, an expert in historical preservation, is Steve Harris, whose addiction to movement and work is both inspirational and exhausting. His HistoriCorps partner for the summer is Megan Potter, a preternaturally cheerful crew leader and camp cook, who seems impervious to the unpleasantries and inconveniences of the field.Rounding out our crew are two emerging journalists/writers, an adventurer from England, and a Ph.D. candidate interning with the group for all three weeks of the project.One of our rank, 78-year-old Bill Yett, holds the HistoriCorps record for the number of volunteer hours, having worked on about 15 projects. I should probably count them. He is also the owner of the most amazingly appointed pop-up camper I have ever seen (I have seen one). A hot shower! A sofa! A full-size bed! A sink! A DVD player! A refrigerator! Used to the fumblings of city folk dabbling in historical preservation, Bill has boundless patience, though he laughs every time I bang my hard-hatted head on scaffolding, which is to say about once an hour.After the first mornings extended safety briefing (the expected warnings against sunburn, dehydration and back injuries, and also the odder cautions against feral pigs and hantavirus), we begin by constructing scaffolding. Steve is an excellent engineer and teacher, and by the end of the day we have a lattice of metal poles ready for us to climb. And to hit our heads on.That night, after a camp dinner of stir fry, I retire to my bed-and-breakfast in thenearby town of Fairplay. Everyone else is camping on site, but I am camping-intolerant. Situated on the high plains (elevation 10,000 feet) in the middle of Colorado, in the South Park National Heritage Area (yes, that South Park), Fairplay serves as a cheaper alternative to ski lodging in Breckenridge in the winter, and an anglers/hikers/gold-panners paradise in the summer, with a requisitely quaint Main Street of knickknack shops, art galleries and souvenir stores.The Hand Hotel has 11 themed rooms (I am in Rancher, with lariat and rocking chair), run-down but comfortable and friendly. Exhausted, I can barely manage a shower before I fall asleep. The next morning I am treated to the hotels ample continental breakfast, served in a sunroom overlooking Fairplay Beach on the South Platte River.Mornings at HistoriCorps projects start with a Safety Circle where we stretch, get to know one another and share a safety concern. All five days I reiterate how important it is to wear a hard hat, what with the attacking scaffolding and all. The dings as my hard hat hits the metal provide a percussion punctuation to the day. Everyone else seems to heed their safety concerns  there are no strained backs or falls from the roof.The next two days on the job site are spent tethered to safety ropes, prying shingles off the roof, an amazingly satisfying activity. When thunder and lightning bring us down from the roof, we explore the old cattle barn. It still holds its original scale and chutes, as well as one scattered cow skeleton. Its hayloft will eventually house the bulk of the book collection, but at the moment it just seems a likely location for hantavirus-carrying feral pigs, so I poke my head in and come back down the ladder. In one of the stalls, which will be turned someday into artists studios, a sparrow learns to fly, cheeped on by its mother.Its cold in the rain, in the 50s, and I nap curled up in a towel on a lawn chair in the mess tent while others play cards until the storm moves past. When the sun comes out, we roast as the temperature climbs into the high 80s, a merciless high-altitude sun accompanied by swarms of Hitchcockian mosquitoes.One can see for miles on a clear day (summer days in central Colorado are mostly clear, with a predictable afternoon shower). The weather warns you of its approach politely on the horizon, cresting the peaks of the Fourteeners (14,000-foot mountains) on the Mosquito range. There are few trees, just short grass and wide, sloping prairie land ideal for ranching. From most vantage points the landscape seems unchanged from the previous century, or even from its prehistoric origins.Over the next two days, our work crew replaces rotten boards on the roof and lays down sheathing in preparation for the shingles. Steve demonstrates proper shingling technique, but we have to wait for the inspector, so we move over to the cedar roof.Cedar shingling requires greater creativity, as the shingles are not standard, and the chooser must paw through the pile to find one that is the perfect width to overlap its neighbors. They smell lovely, like a winter closet, and with the sun shining this is the most pleasant part of the work crew, swinging a hammer (the two nail guns are otherwise occupied) as the new roof begins to take shape.There is a constant dance of equipment sharing and locating, of putting everything away in anticipation of rain (though we work unless theres thunder and lightning) and taking it out again. Meal times are sacrosanct, and I devour Megans pancakes, burritos, chili, sandwich fixings, salads, burgers and other camp favorites. An easy camaraderie develops among us as we chat during our work  fondness turns to light teasing, we develop inside jokes, we start to get to know one anothers likes and dislikes, become attuned to the rhythms of our work.The week passes quickly, especially because I get nightly showers and a bed, though everyone else seems content to camp in the field by the worksite in their tents. Jeff and Ann visit on Thursday to prepare the ranch for a weekend tour, and they share a bit of their vision for the Land Library, thanking us for our help. Almost daily, someone stops by, having heard about the ranch from the New York Times article that inspired many of us to come here, and we put down our tools and play tour guide for a minute or two, proud of our affiliation.Jeff and Anns passion for literature about the American West is based on the exceptional nature of this region, which looms so large in the American imagination. Like the valley in which it sits, the Land Library funnels together individuals enthusiastic about preserving what is in danger of extinction  books and historic places. We are students, Jeff says. Even before were able to put our first books on the shelf, the Land Library at Buffalo Peaks Ranch is all about learning, and gaining new skills.A travel experience in which you preserve and contribute rather than consume is invigorating and sustaining. It is no surprise that after we leave, three participants start Garo, an arts and writing blog inspired by the ranch and the library.The Land Library may be several years and several million dollars away from completion, but Ive played my own small role in bringing it closer to fruition. I return to civilization sore and exhausted, but with a renewed energy for my own writing as a result of spending time helping Jeff and Ann pursue their dream of creating a home for books and those who love them.

{"text": "This interview with Vivian S. Lee, C.E.O. of University of Utah Health Care, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. Tell me about your early years.A. I grew up in Norman, Okla. I was mostly very carefree as a child. I was the exact opposite of the overprogrammed child of today. My parents let me do whatever I felt like doing, and they never pushed me. I never really excelled in anything. I did a lot of different things but nothing very well. And I was often getting in trouble.What flavor of trouble?My parents tell stories of me doing things early on like sticking car keys in the electrical outlet at the post office, dropping my dads watch in the toilet and trying to shave one day.And then in school  Im embarrassed to admit it now  I used to get in trouble and have to go to the principals office. I was just doing goofy things. I remember in seventh grade, my best friend decided to take our Oklahoma history book and pretend to read it upside down in class. I could not stop laughing, and the teacher finally sent me to the principals office.Tell me about your parents.My parents are both university professors. My mother is a statistician and epidemiologist who became the dean of the University of Oklahoma College of Public Health. My father is an electrical engineer and a serial inventor.We used to come up with all these ideas for crazy inventions. When I retire, one thing Im going to work on is reinventing the umbrella. You walk down the street on a rainy day and the trash bins are filled with broken umbrellas.How have your parents influenced your leadership style?They are immigrants. Very successful, but when they came to this country, they didnt really know anybody, they had no guidance, and there were language barriers. So I have a much deeper appreciation and empathy for the wide range of backgrounds that people may be coming from.My parents didnt understand a lot about American culture early on, including the politics of the academic world. You think you can learn English, but there are all the subtleties and implications of how people choose their words, and they struggled with that early on.From an early age, I had some insights as to what they were doing right and maybe what they werent doing right. They would sometimes talk over dinner about an encounter they had at the office. That actually gave me early insights into the dynamics between people and how important those dynamics are for managing and leading people: understanding what they want and getting that alignment between their interests and the organizations.What were some early management lessons for you?One of the things I learned was that I had my own style and it was O.K. for me to use my own style. As a leader, I was not the norm, and I was criticized early on.How so?My style is very consultative. Everybody needs to have a chance to express their views, which is why its very important to have very diverse perspectives around the table. I like to internalize those different views, synthesize them, and then, flavored by my own perspectives, come up with a decision.Early on, after I was running a meeting, a senior person pulled me aside and said, in a very mentoring kind of moment, Vivian, you need to be a leader. You cant be asking people what they think. You need to be telling them.And at that point, I thought to myself, I dont think so. It was a very difficult moment because he was saying that he doubted my ability to lead. Clearly his mind-set was that I had to lead a certain way or I was not a leader. Thats when I knew that what he thought about me was irrelevant. I knew I was right. I need to get to the right decisions in the way that I know best. I think that telling people what to do is really a flawed approach.How has your leadership style evolved?Im a lot more comfortable with a team of people who are very different. Intellectually, I always knew it was a good idea, but it was just not as comfortable. Over time, I have developed a broader appreciation for just how much that diversity brings to the table.Ive always been a pretty good listener, but Im even better now than I used to be, partly because the self-consciousness and worrying how people might judge me as the C.E.O. have really died down, and that enables me to listen better.How do you hire?I put a lot of weight on references and track record. In the interview, Im looking for the differentiator between good and excellent. Thats difficult to really judge in the interview, but I try.Im very interested in a persons internal drive. They should have a real track record of not just excellence, but exceeding expectations, and so I tend to ask about their greatest challenge, and the project or success that made them most proud.Ill also ask what their greatest disappointment or failure has been. I really like to see the ability to learn from mistakes, and humility to recognize their own mistakes instead of blaming other people.What is your best career and life advice for new college grads?Just live in the moment. Pour your heart into whatever it is youre doing and get the most out of that experience. I think people are often so worried about the next step, and the next step after that, that theyre not focused on where they are now.Whatever your environment is, know that you can really extract a lot of value out of it. The people who are most successful draw on all their life experiences, and those experiences inform everything they do."}
{"text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark.   Harrison Heffley played nearly every sport that caught his interest during junior high and high school, from his dominant trade of baseball to basketball, football and even golf.Over the years, Heffley, a senior from nearby Rogers, Ark., has seen and felt pressure from coaches for athletes to take part in year-round, single-sport training just to earn playing time at the varsity level. He has watched friends and opponents train outside school and hit the road with their travel teams, chewing up weekends for months at a time.A hard-throwing left-handed pitcher, Heffley wasnt immune to this kind of effort, either, scheduling baseball workouts each week while playing other sports and often throwing late into the night at his schools indoor facility.Luckily for Heffley, the message he received from his father has always been to have fun and play as many sports as he could.Doing this and not doing the 50-games-a-summer thing as a kid definitely helped me not burn out, said Heffley, who has signed to play baseball at Arkansas. I can tell when I play with some other people that my love for the sport is fresh and still growing.Heffley is an anomaly in a world obsessed with sports specialization, where academies charge tens of thousands of dollars in annual tuition to help children get better at football, basketball, soccer and more. That gives athletes a better shot at a college scholarship, the thinking goes, and most agree that the multisport high school athlete is becoming a thing of the past.It is a trend that has come under particular scrutiny over the last year.Notable figures including the Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer, the golfer Jordan Spieth, members of the United States womens national soccer team and the baseball Hall of Famer John Smoltz are among those who have publicly criticized year-round specialization, primarily for its suspected role in injuries, but for other reasons, too, including pressure and burnout.After working at a high school with 600 students in Las Vegas, Larry Chavez was taken aback when he became the athletic director at 2,400-student Cleveland High in Rio Rancho, N.M. There, he saw volleyball teams with 12 to 14 freshmen and as few as three seniors, and soccer players so tired of the year-round approach that they decided as seniors to try something else.To curb the trend toward specialization, Chavez enacted an incentive-based program for multisport athletes. Beginning in 2014, freshmen and sophomores who participated in multiple sports received T-shirts marking their achievement. Juniors earned a multisport patch for their letter jackets, while seniors received a watch.The program cost the school $3,000 to $4,000, and Chavez said it had been met with enthusiastic support from students.I just feel that with kids, they only have one chance in high school; they only have three or four years of high school experience, Chavez said. And by them being forced, by either high school coaches, parents or club coaches, to specialize so early, I think its hindering their development, and I think thats why theres such a high rate of burnout for our kids.Despite the programs success, this years multiple-sport participants at Cleveland High give a glimpse of what many believe is a national trend. While 85 freshmen are enrolled in the multisport program, the number dips to 62 sophomores, 45 juniors and only 27 seniors.The Michigan High School Athletic Association has created a task force to come up with practical methods of increasing multisport participation. Jack Roberts, the executive director, said he hoped the task force showed that the issue of specialization was a public health crisis.If thats the case, then we have to adopt policies and procedures that intend to reduce those pressures and protect young people, Roberts said, aiming to do so by distinguishing the goals of school sports from those of their club-sport cousins.We have to define what success means in school sports, he said. It might be different in all other levels by all other sponsors, and weve got to keep beating that drum to at least try to neutralize all those other messages that parents and kids and coaches are getting.The notion that specialization is a health crisis has drawn the biggest headlines. Last summer, Smoltz became the first pitcher who had had Tommy John surgery to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame. In his speech, he said children were maxing out too hard, too early and should simply be athletic and play other sports.Research assessing whether sports specialization leads to more injuries is not common, but this year, Timothy McGuine and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation published research suggesting there is a link.According to the preliminary findings, highly specialized athletes were more likely to report a history of knee or hip injuries blamed on overuse; participating in a single sport for more than eight months per year appeared to be an important factor in increased injury risk.The study tracked the participation patterns of and injuries to more than 1,000 athletes at 27 high schools across Wisconsin, including club and school sports. The early results found the greatest instances of specialization in soccer, volleyball and basketball, and found that female athletes (39 percent) were more likely to specialize than male athletes (25 percent).But it was the injury data that surprised McGuine, with 49 percent of specialized athletes sustaining an injury compared with only 23 percent of multisport athletes.The numbers did not differ much for athletes who specialized but tried to reduce their risk by limiting the number of games they played. In those low-volume kids, as McGuine called them, 46 percent of the specialized athletes sustained injuries compared with 20 percent of multisport athletes.Even the high-volume multisport athletes, some who played more than 100 games per year, reported 15 percent fewer injuries than their low-volume specialized counterparts.Specialization is the biggest predictor of a previous lower-extremity injury in these high school kids, said McGuine, who presented his findings in January at a meeting of the Pediatric Research in Sports Medicine Society with members of the National Federation of State High School Associations in attendance.The specialization study is not the only one being followed by McGuine, who is also tracking the effectiveness of headgear in reducing concussions among high school soccer players.However, it is one he hopes to expand in the future, giving parents, coaches and athletes a better frame of reference when deciding whether to specialize at a young age. McGuine knows the issue well, having watched his three children each choose to take part in multiple sports throughout high school, where things have become hyper-competitive.Specialization is not about getting a college scholarship anymore, he said, adding: Its about just getting playing time at their high school with their peers now. Thats the way weve made it, and its a real shame."}
{"text": "OVER the past dozen years, the Supreme Court has issued several landmark decisions affirming that adolescents and adults are fundamentally different in ways that justify treating minors less harshly when they violate the criminal law. The court, drawing on psychological and brain science indicating that people under age 18 are not yet fully capable of controlling their behavior, abolished the juvenile death penalty and greatly restricted life without parole sentences for crimes by juveniles. As scientists and legal scholars who specialize in these issues, we have welcomed these changes with enthusiasm.But in recent months, a number of advocates have sought to extend the developmental immaturity argument to young adults, proposing that the age of juvenile court jurisdiction be raised to 21 from 18, where it now stands in almost all states. This idea has gained some real-world traction. Late last year, for example, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut called on his states Legislature to raise the age of juvenile court jurisdiction, and Illinois and Vermont are now contemplating a similar change.Such reform, though well intended, is premature at best. While considerable scientific evidence supports the distinction that the Supreme Court endorsed between adolescents under age 18 and adults, research on the maturity of young adults (i.e., those between 18 and 21) is at an early stage. We know that brain maturation continues past age 18, but it is not clear that the brains of 20-year-olds are so immature that they should be treated as if they are teenagers.For example, research indicates that a hypersensitivity to reward causes teenagers to focus on the short-term consequences of their actions and assign less importance to the future, which often inclines them toward impetuous and risky activity (such as crime). We know of no evidence indicating that the same is true with regard to young adults.A new study complicates things further. In this research, which appeared this year in Psychological Science, a team led by the neuroscientist B.J. Casey (and including several of us) looked at the impact of emotional arousal on impulse control in three age groups: juveniles between 13 and 17, young adults between 18 and 21, and adults ages 22 to 25. The participants were presented with a rapid series of calm, fearful and happy faces and instructed to press a button when one type of face was shown, but to resist doing so when it was one of the other types. During the experiment, the participants emotional state was manipulated from time to time by leading them to expect that at any moment they might experience something positive (winning a prize), something negative (hearing a loud noise), or neither.The study found that when young adults were negatively aroused (anticipating the noise), they made as many mistakes as juveniles, and significantly more than the somewhat older adults. But under conditions of either low or positive arousal (anticipating the prize), the young adults performed as well as their older counterparts, and significantly better than the juveniles. Are people in their early 20s more like teenagers or more like adults? According to this research: It depends.The proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the juvenile system to age 21, in addition to being based on ambiguous science, would also create two potentially serious policy problems. First, just as the adult correctional system is ill equipped to respond to the needs of adolescents, the juvenile justice system is poorly positioned to handle young adults. It is hard to imagine a juvenile facility that could appropriately house 20-year-olds and 14-year-olds, or a juvenile justice staff whose training would allow it to work effectively with young adults. And because a disproportionate number of serious violent crimes are committed by individuals between 17 and 21, the juvenile system would be overwhelmed by the number of young adults it would need to process, and its rehabilitative purpose could be seriously undermined.Second, the juvenile justice system interacts with several other health and child welfare systems. Those agencies have created relatively separate systems for serving children and adults, in part because of important differences between these two ages. For example, some mental illnesses arise only in young adulthood, and professionals have long specialized in providing services either to children and adolescents or to adults. Creating a juvenile justice system that works well for both adolescents and young adults would require significant (and costly) restructuring of many other agencies.Changes in the ways in which we treat young adult offenders are long overdue. This group has its own distinctive educational and mental health needs. But thats an argument for treating them as a special category of offenders in the adult justice system, not raising the juvenile jurisdictional age. In the long run, this may better serve the interests of young adults and juveniles alike."}

Such was the cry which flew round Paris at an early hour yesterday morning [May 1] over telegraph and telephone wire.This was a rude awakening, a sensational opening to the day of the year which the Anarchists, Nihilists, and Revolutionists claim specially as their own. At first the report received little credence. The Parisian can understand dynamite bombs being thrown in any other city but Paris.But what in the world can anyone want to throw a bomb in Paris for? Nevertheless, the story is perfectly true. And the facts are as follows: Yesterday morning, at four oclock, a dynamite bomb was placed, by some person unknown, in the recess of one of the windows of the hotel of the Marquis de Trvise, 2 rue de Berri.The house is a magnificent block forming the corner of the Champs-Elyses, on your right hand as you enter the rue de Berri.

{"text": "THE BAD-ASS LIBRARIANS OF TIMBUKTUAnd Their Race to Save the Worlds Most Precious ManuscriptsBy Joshua Hammer278 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.In the summer of 1826, a Scotsman named Alexander Gordon Laing became the first European to set foot in Timbuktu, a city that would become synonymous with mysterious remoteness. The inhabitants of Timbuktu would have been amused by the British imperialist assumption that their city had been discovered. By the time Laing reached the place, it had been a thriving international center for centuries, the economic and intellectual heart of the sub-Saharan world, where travelers, traders and thinkers, Africans, Berbers, Arabs, Tuaregs and others gathered to trade gold, salt, slaves, spices, ivory  and knowledge.While Europe was still groping its way through the dark ages, Timbuktu was a beacon of intellectual enlightenment, and probably the most bibliophilic city on earth. Scientists, engineers, poets and philosophers flocked there to exchange and debate ideas and commit these to paper in hundreds of thousands of manuscripts written in Arabic and various African languages. The British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper once remarked: There is only the history of Europeans in Africa. The rest is darkness. Timbuktus staggering manuscript hoard is the most vivid proof of how wrong he was.That ancient literary heritage, and the threat it faces from radical Islam, is the subject of Joshua Hammers book The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu, part history, part scholarly adventure story and part journalistic survey of the volatile religious politics of the Maghreb region. The title is quite irritating; the rest of it is very good.Hammer delights in the explosion of medieval scholarship that took place in Timbuktu. By the 16th century, a quarter of the 100,000-strong population were students, drawn from as far away as the Arabian Peninsula. As one proverb puts it: Salt comes from the north, gold from the south, and silver from the country of the white men, but the word of God and the treasures of wisdom are only to be found in Timbuctoo. As well as religious texts, those treasures included works of poetry, algebra, physics, medicine, jurisprudence, magic, mathematics, history, botany, geography and astronomy. Ethicists debated polygamy, usury, conflict resolution and the morality of smoking. The thinkers of Timbuktu even compiled sex advice, as imaginative and unreliable in the 16th century as it is today: The dried, pulverized penis of a lizard placed tenderly into honey then licked will let a man experience full sexual desire and satisfaction.The citys scribes wrote in a variety of calligraphic styles, inks and colors: the African tradition of Hausa with thick brush strokes, the angled Kufic script from Persia and the curved and looping Maghrebi style. The city was a readers paradise, its inhabitants searching with a real passion for volumes they did not possess, and making copies when they were too poor to buy what they wanted. Eclectic scholarship thrived under the mystical, tolerant form of Sufism that dominated what is now Mali. The city, as Hammer puts it, was an incubator for the richness of Islam. But the tradition of open-minded academic inquiry was also subject to periodic attack from bigots and looters, from bouts of anti-Semitism aimed at the citys substantial Jewish population, and the anti-intellectual rigidity of successive waves of jihadis.The history of Timbuktu, Hammer writes, is marked by the confrontation between these two Islamic ideologies  one open and tolerant, the other inflexible and violent. Radical Islamists saw the manuscripts as heretical, and French colonial forces in the 19th century viewed them as plunder, and so another tradition emerged: that of concealment. The custodians of these priceless documents took to hiding them  inside their homes, in holes or in desert caves. Timbuktus intellectual inheritance was not only among the richest in the world, but also one of the most secret.The hero of Hammers story is Abdel Kader Haidara, inheritor and protector of a uniquely fine manuscript collection, a gentle, scholarly man who began gathering manuscripts in the 1980s on behalf of the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research in Timbuktu. Over the course of two decades, Haidara and other dedicated antiquarians scoured the region, buying up ancient texts from remote villages. Hammer estimates that the intellectual patrimony of Timbuktu now amounts to a staggering 377,000 manuscripts.Then came the 21st-century jihadis, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the latest eruption of Islamic intolerance in the region. In March 2012, briefly combining forces with Tuareg rebels fighting for an independent homeland and armed with weapons from the collapsed Libyan regime of Muammar el-Qaddafi, they descended on Timbuktu.Having driven out the government forces, the Islamists set about the now all-too-familiar process of religious cleansing, enforcement and destruction. The wide-ranging music selection on Timbuktu radio was replaced by uninterrupted Koranic verse, women were forced behind veils, men made to grow beards. Squads of enforcers ensured strict Sharia observance at the point of AK-47s; citizens who wore their pants too short, or allowed their cellphones to ring with Western tunes, or otherwise violated the minutiae of strict Islamism were liable to thrashing or worse. While the Islamists set about imposing their rules, Haidara and the other librarians undertook one of the greatest cultural evacuations in history: The manuscript collections were secretly packed into metal trunks, loaded onto mule carts, and hidden in private houses and then in the Malian capital, Bamako.Hammer writes with verve and expertise, but there are two problems with the thriller tone that underpins his story. The first is the question of just how bad-ass Haidara really was. While his teams were removing manuscripts, he had evacuated himself to Bamako, offering coordination and encouragement from a distance. This is a perfectly acceptable decision for a middle-aged scholar with two wives and lots of children, but it doesnt quite make him Indiana Jones.The level of threat posed to the manuscripts is also debatable. Like most terrorists, the forces of AQIM were on the whole very stupid. The Islamists control of Timbuktu focused on wrecking the ancient Sufi shrines, mounting public amputations and boasting on Twitter; the finer points of the citys cultural heritage didnt seem to interest them, and as Hammer acknowledges, the manuscript collections were mostly ignored until the final stages of the occupation. In January 2013, 15 jihadis made a bonfire of 4,000 manuscripts at the Ahmed Baba Institute. But by that time many of the jewels of the collection were already in safekeeping, and the French military was preparing to oust AQIM in what would be an object lesson in the use of force against radical Islamist forces.The great Timbuktu manuscript exodus may have been more prophylactic than urgently necessary, but it was a remarkable achievement, nonetheless, bringing together international funders, a network of smugglers and a handful of dedicated local curators. The exfiltration required careful cataloging of the collections, and this may be the most lasting legacy of the episode: The Islamists accidentally drew worldwide attention to Timbuktus literary heritage, and enabled the first full accounting of its magnificence."}

Thats because one of his largest projects is Itzana, a resort and residential development in Belize opening later this year.The design is a mix of Spanish and British colonial styles and a beach vibe that celebrates indoor-outdoor living, said Mr. Amoia, 33, who worked for the hotelier Andr Balazs and the designer Stephen Sills before founding his own company in 2012. Every room has an outdoor chaise, sofa and dining table.But when it comes to relaxing outside, he added, its the chaise longue that matters most.Mr. Amoia isnt doing much relaxing himself these days. In addition to his work in Belize, he just introduced a collection of furniture at DeLorenzo Gallery in New York, and will receive a Rising Talent award at Maison&Objet Americas, the design fair running from May 10 to 13 in Miami Beach. But for those who do have time to relax, Mr. Amoia offered a few tips on choosing an outdoor chaise longue. Think about how youll use your outdoor space. If it will be both a social gathering space and a place for sunbathing, you need a chaise that offers an upright sitting position and can also function as a bench when flat. Do you plan to move the chaise around? If so, weight is a consideration  and wheels are desirable. How much maintenance are you willing to do? Some chaise longues need more cleaning and upkeep than others, and some also require covers when not in use.Portside Lounger | $549 at West Elm; (888) 922-4119 or westelm.comThe wire-brushed weathered gray finish of this model, Mr. Amoia said, is simply beautiful.

More often, its an unsatisfying mix of those and other variables: The place is right, the timing is spot on  only you were off.I was 22 years old, and one day into an internship at the ABC program Nightline, when the Sept. 11 attacks happened. They woke this country up from the slumber of the 1990s, and in my case, from a jet-lagged coma in a corporate housing unit down the street from the Pentagon. In a week, I went from a sheltered college existence to having ash on the balcony from the smoldering crash site nearby.My fellow interns and I soon realized we werent ready for the real world to introduce itself so cataclysmically. A White House intern friend, exhausted by the unending hours of TV coverage, marched to the video store one night, bought a VHS copy of the movie Notting Hill and proceeded to wear it out with almost nightly viewings. I went in the other direction and consumed hours of news coverage, studying what occurred from every angle, as if I were still cramming for a final exam I needed to ace.It will forever be a dark time for this country. It was also a terrible time in American history to look or appear even remotely Muslim. A Pakistani-American colleague stopped wearing a prayer ring  given to her by her grandmother  that had Arabic script on it because she got suspicious looks on the subway.My friend and roommate, who like me is Indian-American, waited up for me that first week after Id stumble out of the office at 3 a.m. He did this partly to get the latest news, but also to make sure I was safe from the kind of random retaliation Muslims and even non-Muslims like myself were enduring.As the country was putting the pieces back together, we were suddenly forced to construct our identities in a post-Sept. 11 world. And I had it easy; no turban, no beard, and a tendency to overcompensate with niceness.We had a villain back then: Osama bin Laden, the man who caused all that pain, anger and anxiety. Monday is the fifth anniversary of his death. News outlets will most likely focus on what has replaced him, the fragmented, nihilistic terrorism of groups like the Islamic State. But Ive been thinking back to the months after Sept. 11, when Bin Laden spoke to us through video and audio messages  and I voiced them on screen.The tapes arrived randomly, throwing the newsroom into a frenzy and immediately becoming that evenings lead story. One day, a news producer asked the office bullpen if anyone wanted to voice-over the English translation of Bin Ladens latest ominous message. My hand shot up.In hindsight, this was not something a rational brown male shouldve volunteered for so enthusiastically.My first time in the recording booth, I was feeling my way through. I sat up straight, careful not to rustle any papers, which the sensitive microphones would pick up. In truth, I was trying my best to not sound like the immature college kid I knew in my heart I still was.I did a second take, this time offering to do a Middle Eastern accent, because I fancied myself pretty good at accents and assumed I had license as someone of South Asian descent. A producer on a deadline is prone to say, Yeah, whatever, more than is advisable, and it all seemed innocuous enough. It even provided some gallows humor. Whod we get to voice the most feared man in the world? The guy who routinely messes up printing out copies of the scripts.After another tape came out, I stepped back into the booth. I wanted to go beyond a generic accent this time and impersonate Bin Laden himself, as if Emmys could be awarded for Best Performance of a Radical Jihadist on a Network News Show.Bin Ladens voice was soft, meek; not exactly the fiery orator his apocalyptic worldview seemed to warrant. I tried loosening up my posture and speaking from the back of my throat, hoping to give his voice-over more of a laconic, nasal sound.I soon wondered whether the goal shouldnt be mimicry, but to convey the true threat Bin Laden posed, to add a menacing tone to his banal voice of evil. I joked that my parents could brag to their friends: Oh, your son is a doctor? Well, our son is busy instilling fear into millions of people. I was acting every day anyway, trying to convince the world I was an adult able to function in a professional environment. This was just an extension of that.Then came the day I got the review I had been waiting for. One of the executive producers, an intimidating presence whom I managed to disappoint at seemingly every turn, approached me.Are you the one doing the accents on the Bin Laden tapes? he asked.Yeah! I beamed proudly. Here it was. The pat on the back I was waiting for, the validation I so richly needed and deserved.Knock it off, he said tersely, as if I was merely one of a hundred fires that needed extinguishing that day.I was certain Id be fired. More troubling, knock it off felt like a succinct critique of who I was at that time. It was as if he was saying, whatever you think youre doing here, whomever youre trying to be  knock it off. This is real life. This is war. Grow up. Its not about you.I did one more Bin Laden voice-over. We stress the importance of martyr operations against the enemy, I said, delivering it plain, without emotion  exactly the way I shouldve to begin with.Years later, I watched the celebrations after Bin Laden was killed. I can only hope that moment provided some amount of closure to the families of his victims. The deeper he went into hiding, though, the more he lost his terror grip on me. My favorite detail to come out of the compound raid  other than the stash of pornography  was Bin Ladens attempt to rebrand Al Qaeda with corporate-sounding names like Restoration of the Caliphate Group. He had ceased being our villain, and was now apparently working toward a Master of Terror Administration degree.Five years after his death, Bin Laden seems buried in our collective consciousness, as deep as his body is in the ocean. What remains are those tapes, and our memories of that time. It was a moment in my life when the best advice I couldve received was simply knock it off."}
{"text": "Nadia Marie Gaya and Timothy McKenna Martin were married April 30 by the Rev. Ryan C. Fleenor, an Episcopal priest, who performed the ceremony at St. James Episcopal Church in Manhattan.The bride, 33, works in Manhattan as a senior consultant at Deloitte, where she focuses on tax accounting for insurance companies. She graduated from the University of Chicago, received a law degree from Loyola University of Chicago and a Masters of Laws in taxation from N.Y.U. Her previous marriage ended in divorce.She is the daughter of Marie L. Brate of Rochester and Sikander A. Gaya of Greenwich, Conn., and the stepdaughter of Dr. Richard E. Bolt and of Kathleen Milne.The groom, 34, is the assistant comptroller for public finance in the New York City comptrollers office. He graduated from Rutgers.He is a son of Christina M. Martin of Bordentown, N.J., and Edward M. Martin of Mount Holly, N.J.The couple met in May 2013 after Mr. Martin went to look at an apartment in Brooklyn, across the hall from where Ms. Gaya lived.I went to get lunch and hit the button on my elevator and out walked Tim, Ms. Gaya said. I said to myself, Thats the hottest guy Ive ever seen.After a quick introduction from the woman showing Mr. Martin the apartment, Ms. Gaya, nervous and disoriented, entered the elevator and immediately regretted not getting the mystery mans last name. Something happened in that moment, she said. But I figured, thats it. Its done. Im never going to see him again.But they met at the elevator a second time in early July when Ms. Gaya, fresh from the gym, crossed paths with Mr. Martin as the elevator opened to her floor.I was sweaty and he was wearing a suit and tie on his way to work, she said. Mr. Martin told her he had taken the apartment he had visited earlier. She was in apartment 3H, he in 3B.The next evening, Mr. Martin wandered to the roof of the building and found Ms. Gaya having a Fourth of July weekend barbecue. She invited him to join and the two stayed on the roof long after the party ended. The next day he asked her out on a date.At the outset, I was nervous about dating the girl across the hall, Mr. Martin said. Its like the first thing you learn in college: Dont date someone on your floor.Those reservations eased over the next eight months as the couple settled into a routine of treating the two apartments as one. They cooked in one apartment, then took the food across the hall, where the air-conditioning had perfectly cooled the room. They watched TV in Mr. Martins apartment (since she didnt have one) and treated her apartment as a guesthouse when visitors came to town.He got lucky, she says. He moved in and got the girl, too.She came with the apartment, I suppose, he says."}
{"text": "BRASLIA  They were idealists, united in the struggle against Brazils military dictators.As democracy flourished, so did their careers. One of them, Paulo Ziulkoski, became the leader of an association of Brazilian cities. The other, Dilma Rousseff, rose even higher, becoming the president of Latin Americas largest country.But their friendship soon fell apart. During a contentious meeting with the nations mayors in 2012, Ms. Rousseff rejected pleas for a share of Brazils soaring oil revenues. After the room erupted in jeers, Mr. Ziulkoski said, she stormed up to him, poked a finger in his face and humiliated him with a string of expletives.I never imagined a president could utter such words, Mr. Ziulkoski said, noting that dozens of mayors have abandoned Ms. Rousseff and her party. To Mr. Ziulkoski, the public dressing down was the kind of rupture that symbolized the beginning of the end for her administration.As Ms. Rousseff wages a last-ditch battle to stave off impeachment and save her presidency, she has accused her rivals in Congress of creating  turmoil, saying they are orchestrating a coup dtat to oust her.More than two-thirds of Brazils lower house voted last month to approve an impeachment measure on charges that she illegally borrowed from state banks to plug budget holes. (She is not accused of stealing for personal enrichment.) Many experts say the next step, a trial in the Senate that could begin in the coming weeks, will probably end in her removal.I will struggle with all my might until the coup-mongers are defeated, Ms. Rousseff said in an interview.But many political analysts say Ms. Rousseffs slow-motion downfall can also be tied to an autocratic persona and a go-it-alone work style that has driven away scores of political allies, former staff members and cabinet ministers, many of whom have endured searing episodes of public humiliation.Shes alienated so many politicians and squandered the good will of so many people, in part because of her terrible political skills but also because of her arrogance, said Edson Sardinha, the editor of Congresso em Foco, a magazine that focuses on government corruption. In her hour of need, very few people are willing to run to her defense.The upheaval goes far beyond Ms. Rousseffs leadership style. Brazil is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades, with millions of people falling out of the middle class into poverty. Inflaming their rage, political elites of every stripe have engorged themselves in a multibillion-dollar graft scheme involving the national oil company.Ms. Rousseff, who has been politically battered by the scandal, said she was the victim of a naked power grab and sexist assumptions of how a woman should lead. She also said she was a convenient scapegoat for something she cannot control: the global plunge in commodity prices that has sent the economy into a tailspin.But her vow to bring millions of Brazilians into the streets in her defense has produced little popular support. Siding with her opponents are scores of onetime allies, including five former ministers in her administration, the nations vice president, and six justices on the Supreme Court who were appointed by Ms. Rousseff or her most powerful defender, former President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva.In more than five years in office, Ms. Rousseff has largely refused to meet with members of Congress, both opponents and allies, eroding the majority support she once enjoyed in the lower house. The aggrieved include Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and beloved figure in Ms. Rousseffs Workers Party, who said she had turned down multiple requests for a meeting.In politics, either you talk or you die, said Alfredo Nascimento, a former transportation minister. In April, he voted for her impeachment.I cant support a president who is incapable of governing, he said.In Braslia, the capital, most everyone can recount stories about Ms. Rousseffs intolerance for dissent and her short fuse. The anecdotes include the time she smashed an office computer in anger, her refusal to meet with indigenous leaders or gay rights activists and the castigation of aides for the smallest of infractions.She is also finding little sympathy from the Brazilian news media, which has long viewed her as cold and condescending  a marked contrast to the charismatic, backslapping approach of Mr. da Silva.Some agree that Ms. Rousseff is being judged by a double standard that has unfairly tarnished powerful women around the world. Would she be considered so obstinate and uncooperative if she were a man? Or would she simply be called a strong, decisive leader?The president is enduring all the stereotypes and prejudices of Brazils highly patriarchal and oligarchic society, said Rosana Schwartz, a historian and sociologist at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in So Paulo. Ive even heard people say, We will never again vote for a woman. But Antonia Melo, a former Workers Party member, said Ms. Rousseffs gruff manner had alienated many of the party faithful. Ms. Melo described a meeting, when Ms. Rousseff was minister of energy, during which activists hoped to make their case against a contentious dam project in the Amazon.Ms. Melo said she had barely finished her first sentence when Ms. Rousseff cut her off, pounded on the table and vowed to press forward with the dams construction. Then she turned around and left the room.We stood there looking at each other in silence, perplexed, Ms. Melo said. We felt so disrespected and discarded.The episode was stinging given the origin of the Workers Party and Ms. Rousseffs pedigree as a champion of the disenfranchised. The partys founders were Marxist guerrillas who rose to power through a coalition of trade unionists, landless farmers, indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals who helped pave the way for the re-establishment of democracy in 1985.But that coalition is in tatters. Ms. Rousseff is battling accusations that she hid the depths of Brazils economic troubles to enhance her re-election prospects. Many bedrock supporters are disillusioned by widespread corruption in the national oil company, Petrobras, and by what many describe as Ms. Rousseffs about-face, after her re-election in 2014, on several campaign promises to preserve generous government spending.In recent weeks, at least 135 mayors aligned with the Workers Party have changed their party affiliations  about a fifth of the nations mayors who had been elected on the partys ticket. Among them are Joo Paulo Ribeiro, 31, the mayor of a small city, who said he had grown weary of the attacks by residents and even friends who questioned his association with Ms. Rousseffs party.I have to listen to the people, said Mr. Ribeiro, who changed parties last month, hoping to improve his chances for re-election in October.It is not as if the political figures lining up to oust Ms. Rousseff are viewed as saviors. Many of them are battling serious accusations of corruption, and they were in positions of great power as the countrys once-enviable economy ran aground.Rising unemployment and the broad unrest over Brazils economy only added to the strains between Ms. Rousseff and Congress. Had the economy been ascendant  as it was in 2005 when her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, became embroiled in a vote-buying scandal  she might have emerged unscathed.The end of Brazils bonanza complicated the patronage used to navigate the fractious legislature, in which more than two dozen parties fight for government funding.We have a political system based on extracting money from the economy and transferring it to political parties to finance elections, said Rubens Ricpero, who served as minister of finance in the mid-1990s.Many Brazilian economists and policy makers contend that the economic crisis was largely a product of Ms. Rousseffs own making. She increased the governments footprint in the economy, spending large amounts on favored industries and corporations to build up national champions.That not only produced an array of big, unfinished projects and bad debt, which now hobbles the state-owned banks, but also opened the door to large-scale corruption.Brazil insisted in carrying out an industrial policy devoid of logic, said Arminio Fraga, a former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. When the government offers companies all sorts of advantages, through protection, subsidies and contracts, it creates enormous space for this sort of thing.Friends and associates say Ms. Rousseffs worldview and personality were partly shaped by the three years she was imprisoned by the military, a trauma that included torture like beatings and shocks with an electric baton.As president, Ms. Rousseff has refused to seek vengeance against her torturers, and she was widely praised for backing a National Truth Commission that exposed the abuses of the era but did not mete out punishments to the accused. In 2014, she wept on television after receiving the commissions final report.An economist and career bureaucrat, Ms. Rousseff, 68, had not held elected office until Mr. da Silva, who was barred under the Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term, picked her to run for president on the Workers Party ticket. Mr. da Silva has said he was impressed by her grasp of complex data and her no-nonsense managerial style.Idelber Avelar, an early member of the Workers Party, said Mr. da Silva also viewed Ms. Rousseff as a compliant soldier who would continue his policies and keep the economy humming until he could run again.Clearly, he thought Dilma was somebody he could easily control, a technocrat who would run the machine, which is pretty ironic given that shes proven to be a disastrous administrator, said Mr. Avelar, who now teaches at Tulane University in New Orleans. The root of all her problems is a profound aversion to politics.At least 86 cabinet ministers have come and gone since she took office, and only three remain from her first term. Many were forced to resign after being accused of corruption.Nearly two-thirds of the 594 members in Congress face serious charges like bribery, electoral fraud, kidnapping and homicide, among them Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house leading the impeachment effort. He has been accused of stashing $40 million in bribes.Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of graft, though many people question her innocence, given her role as chairwoman of the national oil company at a time when the epic kickback scheme was being hatched.In an interview, Ms. Rousseff brushed off suggestions that her disdain for retail politics and the horse trading required to pass legislation had contributed to her woes. She defended her decision to ignore members of Congress.There were certain types of blackmail negotiations I would not engage in, she said.For a time, the Brazilian public viewed her steely resolve positively. During her first year in office, Ms. Rousseffs popularity stood at 77 percent, among the highest percentages in recent history. These days, that figure is in the single digits.Many Brazilians still admire Ms. Rousseffs ethics. But after two years of economic turmoil, her televised speeches prompt a cacophony on the streets, as thousands bang on pots and pans to drown out her voice.Few give Ms. Rousseff credit for big achievements, including a landmark freedom of information law and measures that gave federal police and prosecutors new tools to tackle corruption.In some ways, analysts said, Ms. Rousseff has become a victim of those laws, which paved the way for the investigations that have claimed scores of the political and business elite, exposing the depths of Brazils political rot.This is one of the greatest paradoxes of her fall, because she put in place the machinery that ensnared the politicians who mattered the most, said Gregory Michener, a professor at Fundao Getlio Vargas, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro. Dilma did a lot for good government, and I think she ultimately wanted good government, but in the end she wasnt a good politician because in Brazils rent-seeking party system, she was unwilling to give her allies their fill."}
{"text": "Luckily for all, reviewers get to return to a restaurant before they render a verdict.The first meal I had at Tillies, a farm-to-table restaurant that opened in Short Hills in November, included items I would happily eat again, like mashed root vegetables beneath a buttery short rib; a winy foie gras sandwiched between golden brioche; and a simple but irresistible sundae. Other dishes, however, did not quite justify the hoopla that surrounded the restaurants opening.A second visit changed my mind. A juicy filet of Long Island sea trout was as hearty as it is rare to find on restaurant menus, and a beurre blanc with bits of grapefruit lime and fresh tarragon lifted a scallop entree into the memorable category. If Wirt Cook, the executive chef and a co-owner, were to argue that the quality of ingredients justified the restaurants prices, which hover in the $30 range, I would take the deal. Scallops, for example, are priced similarly at other restaurants Ive visited, but I think Mr. Cooks are better.Other items that tipped the balance in Tillies favor were the plain, white dinner rolls, so soft and buttery you wished you could rest your weary head upon them, and a deliciously grainy cornbread sweetened with honey. Baked in house, the breads were served with a cold, sweet butter that tasted freshly churned.A pork belly, which Mr. Cook cures and smokes over fruit-flavored wood for six to eight hours, was popular at my table. Its one of his signature dishes, said Karen Cook, the restaurants co-owner and pastry chef and Mr. Cooks wife. The Maine mussels, however, stole its thunder. Thanks to bits of smoked trout, the broth around the mussels was as heady and gripping as that in any well-seasoned bouillabaisse. Only the accompanying slivers of rye toast struck the wrong note; a more absorbent bread, a baguette, perhaps, would have been better for sopping up the broth.Vegetable plates are often dull and austere; Mr. Cooks version is lively and executed with style. Seasonal and purchased from local farms, the several varieties of vegetables, even the potatoes, tasted new and different. As served on the eve of spring, the plate included crispy brussels sprouts; slippery maitake mushrooms; parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes roasted into a kind of candy; and globes of shimmering pearl onions. The liquor from the vegetables turned the faro beneath them into something extraordinary, and roasted garlic suffused the entire dish with a sweet and pungent flavor. Insufficiently filling for dinner, the plate worked well as a shared appetizer or as an extra dish for the table.Does the kitchen err? Occasionally. A Caesar salad was bland despite the capers and anchovies in the dressing, and a mixed greens salad tasted, stunningly, of nothing. A whole poussin bore the deliciously smoky flavor of the wood fire on which it was grilled, but the accompanying faro, lacking the flavorful juices that accented it on the vegetable plate, was unexciting. Disappointing, too, was Mr. Cooks shrimp and grits. Despite the pedigree of its two principal ingredients (Louisiana shrimp and Castle Valley Mill grits), it did not stand out from similar versions, although the sauted onions and peppers beside it were full of fruity pizazz.The room is tastefully decorated, though given the provenance of the food, it seems a bit austere. It lacks the kind of creature comforts that hard Windsor chairs make you desire: cushions, for example.A bite of Ms. Cooks Key lime pie dispels any sense of discomfort. Not even Key lime pies sampled in Florida (or at Steves Authentic Key Lime Pies in Red Hook, Brooklyn) were more satisfying or elegant than Ms. Cooks version, which is fortified with a hard, buttery crust of vanilla wafers, and a filling that she beats until its free of any gelatinous texture. Sundaes, too, are a pure and unequivocal adult pleasure. As for the decaffeinated coffee, compared to whats served at many other restaurants, this version, served in a French press, is a miracle.The restaurants name is a homage to Matilda Hennessey, Mr. Cooks grandmother, who put a hot meal on the table seven nights a week for her 10 children, Ms. Cook told me on the phone after my visits.Both Wirt and I grew up in families where the legitimate heart of the home was truly the kitchen,\" she said. That was the feel we were going for when we opened Tillies.As for the owners last name, I couldnt help but wonder whether this was a calculated name change after culinary school.Ha ha, nope, Ms. Cook replied. He was born a Cook."}

{"text": "After an acclaimed seven-year run, The Good Wife comes to an end on Sunday, May 8. And as the television shows creators, the husband-and-wife team of Robert and Michelle King, and its star, Julianna Margulies, gathered at a SoHo hotel for an interview in mid-April, just three days after filming the 156th and final episode of the CBS drama, it was clear they hadnt quite decompressed yet.Someone said You must feel great, you wrapped, Ms. Margulies said. And I said, I feel like Im in a dream. Im not quite there yet.[ The cast of The Good Wife on favorite moments from the show ]The Good Wife  initially inspired by the spectacle of stand-by-your-man news conferences like those involving Silda Wall Spitzer, married to the disgraced governor of New York  traced the professional and personal re-education of Alicia Florrick (Ms. Margulies), the wife of a discredited politician forced to resume her legal career to support her family.With wryly literate writing, complicated characters and timely explorations of issues like abortion, gun rights, gay marriage and government surveillance, the hourlong drama was an outlier among the procedurals and nighttime soap operas of the broadcast networks. And shows of its kind  serialized dramas stretching nearly two dozen episodes each season  may well be a vanishing breed as actors and writers tire of the grueling July-April filming schedules, preferring the shorter seasons of prestige cable and limited network series. The Kings next TV endeavor is the 13-episode BrainDead on CBS this summer, a satirical mash-up of sci-fi, horror and Washington politics.During a nearly two-hour interview, Ms. Margulies and the Kings often finished one anothers sentences and joked about working together again  on a one-woman show about a female Stalin. In these edited excerpts, they chatted about their goals for the finale, the changes in Alicia and the challenges of shooting sex scenes for broadcast television.Earlier this year, there were rumblings that The Good Wife might return for an eighth season even though the Kings were leaving. How did the decision to end the show come about?JULIANNA MARGULIES I felt like I was put between a rock and a hard place. I was getting messages from all over the place that if you want to keep doing the show, CBS will do it. And in the beginning of the year, Michelle and Robert came to me and said were writing the show as if it were ending, because were out. So suddenly I felt like I was put in this very precarious position. If I say yes, Im screwing them over, because they had a vision for the show, and its their baby. And if I say no, the networks going to be angry, and so is the cast and the crew.But then CBS made that decision for me, and I didnt have to do a thing. David Stapf, who is the head of CBS Studios, called me and he said, The last thing that I would want of the show that has been a feather in CBSs cap for seven years is for the eighth year, without the Kings, to be the one where critics start saying they should have ended when the Kings did. And hes right. I think they were honoring the Kings intentions.ROBERT KING Plus, we were sabotaging things. We kept starting trash fires in the writers room. [Everyone laughs.]Finales can be tricky endeavors, given how viewers chime in on social media. What was your vision for the ending of The Good Wife?MICHELLE KING The only thing Ill say is that the show has always been all about Alicia. So the finale just had to honor the end of Alicias journey.ROBERT KING One of the things we wanted to do is show how much that character had changed. Not just a flipped-switch change but progressively over seven seasons. Thats why there are some memories in some of the shows weve done this year.What were the biggest changes for Alicia?MARGULIES I think her biggest change was not caring what people thought. Which enabled her to forge ahead. She stopped worrying about being the good girl, even though deep down inside thats who shell always be, inherently. And as Alicia started to become better at her job, she managed to change who she was in her private life.MICHELLE KING I do think shes a different person. Thematically for the series, its all about what are the consequences of even unfortunate things in your life. Alicia started with something horrible, when she was publicly humiliated. Her husband cheated on her with prostitutes. But thats what pushed her to have this new and interesting life. Is bad news always bad news? I think youll see that question raised all over.How else did the show change during its seven seasons?MICHELLE KING In Season 1, it was more 50-50 in terms of closed-ended cases versus serialized stories. And then the show became more serialized. And its tricky to do. Theres a reason that serialized shows live more on cable and streaming than they do on network. Because its really hard to top yourself 22 times and not get to melodrama. Scandal embraces it, and good for them. They dont try to live in reality. But if you try to live in reality, like The Good Wife does, thats a difficult thing to do.ROBERT KING You couldnt keep throwing the bombs that we could throw in the fifth season when we knew Josh Charles [who played Will Gardner, Alicias erstwhile boss and love interest] was leaving and that we could break up Alicia and Will, knowing we were going to kill him in the 15th episode. But we couldnt kill someone every episode.Thats why networks like hospital shows. There can be blood on the floor in every episode.For shows that arent formulaic procedurals like the NCIS clan or a nighttime soap like Scandal, does the departure of The Good Wife herald an end of an era?MICHELLE KING If it is an end of an era, and I dont know if it is, its because of the actors. The actors, rightly, dont want to work that many episodes if theres an option. To do 13 or 15 episodes and have a life, and do your best work, I think a lot of stars are now saying thats where Id like to live, please.ROBERT KING One of the reasons why networks struggle with it is because its hard to maintain a voice with 22 episodes. So maybe it is the last, only because its really insanely hard work.MICHELLE KING It could be that stand-alone stories remain on networks, because thats what they do really well. And I think they can be a lot of fun, these strictly procedural, closed-ended shows that dont live and die on the quality of the acting. Part of it is a puzzle element or a mystery.Julianna, what would it take for you to commit to another network show with 22 episodes a year?MARGULIES Theres no amount of money in the world.ROBERT KING Is that true? Even if you like the part?MARGULIES Even if I like the part.ROBERT KING So you wont do network again, but youd do cable?MARGULIES In a heartbeat. I would do cable for sure, because its four months. Its like doing a movie.If a network would do 11 episodes and then have a two-month break and then do 11 [more], I could do it. Because its not just a commitment of time on set. Id come home at the end of a 14-hour day, I have a family to tend to, and then I have nine pages of dialogue to learn. So it just never ends.What characters or plot lines saw their arcs changed or dialed back over the course of the show?ROBERT KING Christine Baranskis character [Diane Lockhart], at the very start of the show, was supposed to be kind of the bitchy boss to Alicia. It was playing off of one premise, which is the mentor who comes to sabotage her mentee. If anybodys met Christine Baranski, though, you can only go so far with that before you embrace just how wonderful she is. She had this incredibly good funny laugh that we would hear in the dailies between the takes. Why are we sending her off in this kind of direction? Lets have other people be villains.One we cut short was because he got another job. That was Jason OMara [who played Damian Boyle]. He was more of a gang lawyer, a little shady. What was supposed to happen was that when Will died, he was someone who really stepped up. Then he got a job, on Complications.MICHELLE KING That happened a lot, didnt it? If youre trying to do a serialized story with actors who are not your regular cast, you have to be a bit nimble.MARGULIES They had a whole idea for Oliver Platt, but then he got a series.MICHELLE KING He was a very smart, very conservative businessman, and it really allowed us to play with issues with the Diane character being such a liberal. And yet to be able to see them as intellectual equals and be very respectful of one another even when they had different opinions, that was really interesting to explore. So it was a great pity when we couldnt have access to that.ROBERT KING One of the things we wanted to pursue on the show more and more is theres a real left-leaning bias on TV, which Ive heard about. [Everyone laughs.] You watch TV, and if theres a priest, you know hes going to be a child molester. Theres a predictability. Its not even trying to be propaganda for the right; its just that there should be an honest discussion that shows that for people on the other side of abortion or on the other side of gay marriage, theres an intellectual argument there.What was it like having to hew to broadcast network standards and practices?ROBERT KING There is a problem standards and practices has with thrusting.MARGULIES Did you just say thrusting?ROBERT KING The thrusting issue. And we would have to delicately go around problems of thrusting in pretend-sex that anybody would have. Wed even have to morph images because we wouldnt get a take that was clean of thrusting.But it was kind of amazing how much CBS let us do. The first episode of the second season was about oral sex.What did the departure of Josh Charles allow you to do differently?ROBERT KING The loss of Josh seemed like it would be catastrophic to us, but I thought it gave us a new lease on who Alicia was, with the underpinning of mourning. How does a [series] show the fact of someone dying, as opposed to a lot of these shows that kill off someone every week?Is there any merit to the rumblings of a feud between Julianna and Archie Panjabi [who played the private investigator Kalinda Sharma], that they didnt film their scenes together toward the end of her run on the show?MARGULIES Its all silly gossip, and I dont want to go there.If the show were to continue, what are some of the issues that you would want to deal with?ROBERT KING Trump and populism. How American democracy is veering a little more toward European populism, both on the left and on the right. The right wing is tending to be anti-immigrant, and the left is looking toward socialism.MICHELLE KING I was just stumbling over the fact that there are certain companies that have manifestoes online about how proud they are for the number of people they fire. And I just thought, oh, thats an episode. And yet there are no more to write.And if there were one more plotline for Alicia, what would it be?MARGULIES One of the things I found interesting this year was what Eli [the political adviser to Peter Florrick] kept saying, that Alicias the star. Because Alicia doesnt see herself that way, at all. So even though there was this jilted run for states attorney that she got thrown under the bus for, I would love to see how far that could go. Especially in the environment of Hillary [Clinton] right now, I think that would be really interesting."}
{"text": "THE COSMOPOLITANSBy Sarah Schulman377 pp. Feminist Press. Cloth, $27.95; paper, $15.95.New Yorkers have a special way of moving. They advance ever forward, says a character in Schulmans voluptuous novel of Greenwich Village in 1958, when you could catch Carmen McRae at Trude Hellers nightclub and buy a brownstone on 10th Street for $30,000. Despite their longtime Village pedigree, however, the neighbors and soul mates Earl and Bette are stuck in place. Earl, a gay black actor consigned to working in a slaughterhouse, is hemmed in by the masquerades of the closet and the debasing roles available to performers of color. Bette, a white ad-agency secretary who, at 50, works for a ditsy young man, cant let go of the grievous treatment she suffered some 30 years earlier at the hands of her Ohio family and former beau.Enter, with suitcase and copy of Stanislavsky, Bettes cousin Hortense, a would-be actress with a fire to rival Eugene ONeills barroom agitator Hickey. If this setup nods to ONeill, Balzac and Henry James, its fringe-dwelling characters channel the lonely-hunter spirit of Carson McCullers (the subject of Schulmans 2002 biographical play). The Cosmopolitans is a book of sighs, for dreams thwarted and for a city that has long since moved on.SCARPIABy Piers Paul Read367 pp. Bloomsbury, $27.Redressing the reputations of reviled antagonists from literature or the stage can seem a potty, if lucrative, enterprise. (See Gregory Maguires Wicked.) In Scarpia, Read sets out to vindicate the unscrupulous police chief from Tosca, who may have been based on a real-life Bourbon baron. In contrast with Puccinis opera and the Sardou play from which it came, wherein the character tortures his rival and blackmails a revered opera diva for sex, this scrubbed-up Scarpia is an old-school romantic vulnerable to the advances of polyamorous women. His Achilles heel, in the words of a superior officer, is a propensity to show mercy. He is unwilling to go for a kill when his man is down.The book opens with fablelike charm as it tracks the mercurial fortunes of its hero, tumbling in dishonor from the Spanish Royal Guards and then ascending among the Roman elite, as well as the rising star of Tosca, a gardeners daughter turned operatic darling. But well before they meet cute in a Venetian gondola, the narrative bogs down in a recitation of power plays between the embattled republican and loyalist factions. A cymbal-crash of a climax is waiting in the wings, but the effect is that of a clanging school bell at the end of a drifting lecture.TIME IS THE FIREBy Alfred Alcorn207 pp. Pleasure Boat Studio, paper, $17.95.When you are named for one of the most influential characters in 20th-century literature, expectations are your daily bread. Such is the lot of Leopold Bloom OBoyle, clerical husband, Harvard-hugger, hot-dog eater and travel writer cum novelist encore manqu famous for a magazine piece called Trekking With Jess, in honor of the lovesick Peruvian guide who abandoned him in the middle of nowhere. On the theory that his Joyce-venerating late father wanted him to write a novel worthy of his name, Leopold vacillates between a navel-gazing update of Ulysses set in 1992 Cambridge, Mass. (as is this novel), and a high-minded exercise in genre sci-fi with one eye on philosophical maunderings and the other on Hollywood.When not toiling over his novels plot (which hinges, inevitably, on the destruction of Earth), Leopold muses on the creation of life with his newly pregnant wife. En route Alcorn entertains with riffs on fiction and a pleasurable cascade of word plays (He had gotten seminal with a seminarian), prankish names (Graham Crocker III), brush stroke perceptions and sexual puns that would heat the cockles of Joyces multitasking heart.GARDEN LAKESBy Jaime Clarke264 pp. Bloomsbury Reader, paper, $16.Give me the child until he is 17 and Ill give you the adult white-collar criminal. This is the thrust of Clarkes earnest spin on the Lord of the Flies formula, wherein a chosen array of Arizona prep-school juniors are corralled for a summer fellowship program and become liberated from the constraints of their elders. Presto: A convocation in character building and leadership skills descends into Camp Runamuck.The pivotal events occur in the late 1980s, though Clarke intermittently jumps to the present for a flat-footed drama that finds the narrator (a veteran of that tumultuous fellowship) now a corruption-busting journalist whose integrity is on the line. His flashbacks avoid any cultural signposts of the boys watershed summer, maybe in a bid for timelessness. But the lack of period specificity only contributes to the generic quality of the ride, which owes less to William Golding than to a Salinger-cum-Dead Poets Society-inflected idea of boarding school in which authority figures are garbed in the primary-color costume of good cop or bad, while their interchangeably roguish wards have cooler-than-thou nicknames (Figs, Smurf, Sprocket) that stand in for actual character development.SHYLOCK IS MY NAMEThe Merchant of Venice RetoldBy Howard Jacobson275 pp. Hogarth Shakespeare, $25.Oy gevalto, were back on the Rialto, a character groans in this ebullient riff on Shakespeare, capturing the novels blend of purposeful dj vu and Jewish fatalism. Jacobson, a Booker-winning author, enlists the moneylender Shylock as a sort of confidant and adviser to his 21st-century counterpart, Strulovitch  a philanthropist, art connoisseur and Zionist with a knotty relationship to his religion: Being a Jew was everything to him, except when it wasnt.When Strulovitchs 16-year-old daughter falls for a much-married uber-goy footballer who favors thuggish displays (e.g., giving a Nazi salute after scoring a goal), Strulovitchs reaction prompts acerbic debates about the role of circumcision, masturbation and comedy in Jewish culture. These culminate in a bracing look at Shylocks pound of flesh bargain with his adversary Antonio (the merchant of Shakespeares title, here updated as a gay importer of objets dart). Jacobsons high-flying wit is more Stoppardian than Shakespearean, even amid rom-com subplots and phallocentric jests equally well suited to Elizabethan drama as to the world of Judd Apatow."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump is leading Senator Ted Cruz of Texas by double digits in Indiana, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, an ominous sign for Mr. Cruz going into the crucial primary there on Tuesday.A loss in Indiana would represent a near-fatal blow to Mr. Cruzs campaign and would significantly increase pressure on him to withdraw from the race.The new poll, released Sunday, shows Mr. Trump taking 49 percent of the vote to 34 percent for Mr. Cruz. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has not been campaigning in the state by agreement with Mr. Cruz, receives 13 percent.If Mr. Trump carries Indiana, which awards its 57 delegates to the statewide winner and to the winner of each congressional district, he will be far better positioned to clinch the Republican nomination on June 7, the last day of primary contests.Mr. Cruz has mounted an all-out fight in Indiana  convincing Mr. Kasich to withdraw from competing there, naming Carly Fiorina as his would-be running mate at a rally in Indianapolis and criss-crossing the state.But on Saturday he gave up a full day of Indiana politicking to appear at Californias state Republican convention with Ms. Fiorina. There, he declaredthat California is going to decide this Republican primary.Candidates wooing local party activists often make such pronouncements, but Mr. Cruzs trouble in Indiana  which is also reflected in private polls conducted by his campaign, according to Republicans briefed on those surveys  suggests that the remark may represent something more significant: a new rationale to remain in the race after Indiana.Mr. Cruzs polls show he is not trailing Mr. Trump in Indiana as badly as he was rightafter dropping five more states late last month, but his supporters are increasingly skeptical about their prospects in Indiana.Mr. Trump said on Fox News Sunday that if he wins in Indiana, the Republican race will be effectively over.Cruz cannot win, hes got no highway, hes got nothing, hes way behind, Mr. Trump said.For his part, Mr. Cruz was asked nine times by Chuck Todd on NBCs Meet the Press if he would support Mr. Trump as the nominee. The Texas senator filibustered, offering reason after reason that Mr. Trump should not be the nominee, but never directly answered the question.Trip Gabriel contributed reporting."}
{"text": "No one talks that much about black love.We often talk about how young black kids love basketball, but rarely about the sustaining love that allowed some to escape the pathology of the ghetto, to flee to predominantly white schools, to the N.B.A., where they earn enough to leave the hood behind  physically, mentally and emotionally. For good.No one talks about the love that sustained the journey.Baron Davis has.In his documentary about the Drew, a summer basketball league in the heart of South Central Los Angeles, Davis uses a basketball league to convey the compassion and the loyalty that allowed him to go from South Central to an exclusive Los Angeles high school to U.C.L.A. and the N.B.A. without leaving home.It is a hood story and its a positive hood story, Davis said in a recent interview. Theres good stuff in our neighborhood: good people, good leaders, good mentors. That was the beauty of the film. We tried to bring out that community element.Davis, a two time N.B.A. All-Star, has quietly pursued a second career as a filmmaker. His film about the Drew, which he completed last year, is his fourth as executive producer. He signed a distribution deal with Showtime, which premiered the documentary on Friday.Daviss powerful story tells a tale familiar to so many players who have survived and overcome to reach the N.B.A. or some other level of professional basketball. Davis said the spark for the documentary came to him during the 2011 N.B.A. lockout. The lockout began in July that year. All of a sudden, the Drew became a magnet for college players who had just graduated, but also for suddenly out-of-work N.B.A. players and pros who had been competing in overseas leagues.You look up, 40 to 50 guys in college, playing overseas, in the N.B.A., and now theyre all at The Drew, Davis recalled. And its cool to be in the hood.I said, We got to capture this moment. Founded in 1973, the Drew  named because the games were played at Charles Drew Middle School in Compton  began as a six-team league designed as a safe haven for young people in South Central Los Angeles, a place to learn through basketball.In 1985, Dino Smiley became the leagues second commissioner. Daviss documentary is as much about Smiley, who still runs the league, as it is about the thousands of players who have come through over the years. Smiley emerges not just as the commissioner, but also as a father and an authority figure, an arbiter of justice, a counselor and a community pillar.Theres a Dino in everybodys hood, Davis said. Theres a Dino in every urban area in America who is opening up these gyms, opening his house, and helping kids change their lives. For us, as African-Americans in this country, thats all we really have.Davis, who turned 37 last month, lived seven blocks from Drew, but he said he only became aware of the tournament at 13, when he felt  or, more likely, some adult felt  that Davis was ready to take the plunge into basketball adulthood.His first exposure was traumatic. Pretty much being cursed out by grown men, he recalled. When a player tried to stand up for Davis, reminding the teammate that Davis was just a kid, the teammate was having none of it. What the hell is he doing here? he screamed. Stop turning the ball over, kid.Stay and take it, or go home and cry. Davis stayed, and grew. He would meet all the players he had heard about  high school stars, playground legends, college stars, N.B.A. players. Byron Scott. Michael Cooper. Lester Conner.For me, these were my legends, he said.Davis has been connected to the Drew ever since, seeing its ups and downs not only as part of its N.B.A. fraternity, but now through the prism of a filmmaker.And now the Drew is being discovered by the mainstream.Now its starting to get the cachet, its starting to get the love from the outside community, from the Westside, from people from Orange County, Davis said. Youre seeing white people in Watts, enjoying the games. This is going to be the tipping point for the Drew.Daviss chief rival in high school was Kenny Brunner, who starred at Dominguez High School while Davis was at Crossroads. While Davis selected U.C.L.A. and flourished, Brunner chose Georgetown, traveled east and floundered. He transferred to Fresno State but was kicked off the team and made misstep after misstep. Eventually, he served time in jail.During an emotional scene in the film, Smiley welcomes Brunner back to the Drew. Brunner cries as they hug.He was crying for so many reasons, Davis said. Not making the McDonalds All-American game, not being able to stay at Georgetown, not going pro.This is the black love that often goes unseen, on film and in life.A lot of times, guys give up, Davis said. We dont get a lot of opportunities, so when we give up, it doesnt just take you two steps back, it knocks you all the way back down the ladder.Id like to see more young African-American athletes tell  and own  the multifaceted stories of their journeys from the Comptons of the world to the pros. While many people can tell that story, black men and women are the only ones who truly know what its like to exist, survive and prosper as black men and women in the United States.For Davis, the challenge of making a documentary about an event so close to his heart was how to bring the joys, the frustrations, the highs and lows to film. But more important: how to let the emotions speak for themselves?So there were scenes of trash-talking, of heated yet playful interactions between fans and players. Davis tells the story of the Kevin L. Dandridge Most Inspirational Player Award, named after a player who exemplified the spirit of the league but was killed in a shooting decades ago.But in producing a film about a world he knew, a community in which he lived, Davis also wanted to get away from the typical black basketball story of desperation: of players desperately trying to reach the pros. Rather, Davis wanted to present the portrait of his community. Of taking life as it comes. Of accepting the bitter with the sweet.How can we make a basketball documentary thats not really a basketball documentary? he asked.The result is a unique approach to a summer basketball documentary. Fresh, because no one talks that much about black love."}
{"text": "Every January for the past decade, Jessica Irish of Saline, Mich., has made the same New Years Resolution: to cut out late night snacking and lose 30 pounds. Like millions of Americans, Ms. Irish, 31, usually makes it about two weeks.But this year is different.Ive already lost 18 pounds, she said, and maintained my diet more consistently than ever. Even more amazing  I rarely even think about snacking at night anymore.Ms. Irish credits a new wearable device called Pavlok for doing what years of diets, weight-loss programs, expensive gyms and her own willpower could not. Whenever she takes a bite of the foods she wants to avoid, like chocolate or Cheez-Its, she uses the Pavlok to give herself a lightning-quick electric shock.Every time I took a bite, I zapped myself, she said. I did it five times on the first night, two times on the second night, and by the third day I didnt have any cravings anymore.As the name suggests, the $199 Pavlok, worn on the wrist, uses the classic theory of Pavlovian conditioning to create a negative association with a specific action. Next time you smoke, bite your nails or eat junk food, one tap of the device or a smartphone app will deliver a shock. The zap lasts only a fraction of a second, though the severity of the shock is up to you. It can be set between 50 volts, which feels like a strong vibration, and 450 volts, which feels like getting stung by a bee with a stinger the size of an ice pick. (By comparison, a police Taser typically releases about 50,000 volts.)Other gadgets and apps dabble in behavioral change by way of aversion therapy, such as the $49 MotivAider that is worn like a pager, or the $99 RE-vibe wristband. Both can be set to vibrate at specific intervals as a reminder of a habit to break or a goal to reach. The $80 Lumo Lift posture coach is a wearable disk that vibrates when you slouch. The $150 Spire clip-on sensor tracks physical activity and state of mind by detecting users breathing patterns. If it detects youre stressed or anxious, it vibrates or sends a notification to your smartphone to take a deep breath.But the Pavlok takes things a step further, delivering a much stronger message.To test the device, I wore it for a week, zapping myself every time I ate dessert. My goal was to curb my craving for sweets after dinner. First I zapped myself before and after I ate a square of dark chocolate, and did it again later in the week after eating ice cream, a red velvet cupcake and a chocolate chip cookie.Set on low, it feels like a strong tickle. Set on high, it hurts. A lot.It should be noted that the creator of Pavlok, Maneesh Sethi, once hired a woman to sit next to him and slap him on the face every time she saw him using Facebook, so he could increase his productivity. I called Mr. Sethi and told him that if we ever met, Id try not to punch him in the face for creating such an awful torture device. Yeah, I get that a lot, Mr. Sethi said with a chuckle. People either love it or hate it.Its not designed to be painful, he added. Its instantaneous, a surprise sensation, a shock that knocks you out of automatic mode.But does this kind of self-imposed aversion therapy actually work?The most clever thing about this gadget is the name, said Dr. Peter Whybrow, a Los Angeles author, psychiatrist and neuroscientist. Its an expensive spin on the idea of wearing an elastic band that you snap on your wrist to stop a certain behavior.Dr. Marc Potenza, a professor of psychiatry at Yale, says researchers have questioned the ethical nature of shock intervention when more comfortable options like cognitive behavioral therapies, pharmaceutical interventions and 12-step programs are available.The practice of aversion therapy has been around for 80 years. Schick Shadel Hospital, based in Seattle, reports that it has successfully treated more than 65,000 people for alcohol or drug addiction using counter-conditioning methods like emetic drugs, which make people feel nauseated if they drink alcohol, or supervised shock therapy. The hospitals medical director, Dr. Kalyan Dandala, said that he was interested in using Pavlok to help people continue recovery once they finish the 10-day inpatient treatment, but added that the device should be professionally supervised.Its better suited as a prescribed tool for behavior modification, Dr. Dandala said. The company needs to refine it, put more education in the tool, and have more oversight.Michelle Freedland, a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Manhattan, has worked with five patients who use the device for nail biting, addictions, compulsive behaviors and more.When one of my patients told me he was using it last year to help him get out of bed in the morning, I was skeptical at first, she said. I mean, the notion of being shocked  you can have a little reservation. But when you understand how to use it properly and people are more engaged in their own treatment, they tend to follow through with it more.Mr. Sethi, the founder, said the company had just begun to collect data on the long-term success of the device, and was planning a clinical trial later this spring. The Pavlok has been available since November, and he said about 10,000 people had used it.Despite the potential for pain and the lack of science backing a long-term effect, user feedback on Facebook groups and message boards has been enthusiastic about the device, especially as a last resort for problems like overeating and binge drinking.Bud Hennekes, 24, a blogger in St. Louis, said he had used Pavlok to kick a nearly two-pack-a-day cigarette habit. When I tried to quit before, I still had the craving to smoke, he said. When I used Pavlok, the cravings completely went away. I dont know if its science or a placebo effect or what, and I dont really care because it worked.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "Andrew Sullivan has returned to journalism (blow, ye trumpets!) with an essay that dovetails in certain ways with my own Sunday column, which made the case thatAmericans both Trumpist and anti-Trump are basicallypining for a king. Sullivans essay puts a political-philosophy spin on the same phenomenon,portraying Donald Trump as the quintessence of Platos tyrannical soul (a man not having control of himself [who] attempts to rule others ) and our society as a hyper-egalitarian and hyper-libertarian fulfillment of Platos warning about the ease with which democracy cansuccumb to tyranny:This rainbow-flag polity, Plato argues, is, for many people, the fairest of regimes. The freedom in that democracy has to be experienced to be believed  with shame and privilege in particular emerging over time as anathema. But it is inherently unstable. As the authority of elites fades, as Establishment values cede to popular ones, views and identities can become so magnificently diverse as to be mutually uncomprehending. And when all the barriers to equality, formal and informal, have been removed; when everyone is equal; when elites are despised and full license is established to do whatever one wants, you arrive at what might be called late-stage democracy And it is when a democracy has ripened as fully as this, Plato argues, that a would-be tyrant will often seize his moment.He is usually of the elite but has a nature in tune with the time  given over to random pleasures and whims, feasting on plenty of food and sex, and reveling in the nonjudgment that is democracys civil religion. He makes his move by taking over a particularly obedient mob and attacking his wealthy peers as corrupt. If not stopped quickly, his appetite for attacking the rich on behalf of the people swells further. He is a traitor to his class  and soon, his elite enemies, shorn of popular legitimacy, find a way to appease him or are forced to flee. Eventually, he stands alone, promising to cut through the paralysis of democratic incoherence. Its as if he were offering the addled, distracted, and self-indulgent citizens a kind of relief from democracys endless choices and insecurities. He rides a backlash to excesstoo much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery  and offers himself as the personified answer to the internal conflicts of the democratic mess. He pledges, above all, to take on the increasingly despised elites. And as the people thrill to him as a kind of solution, a democracy willingly, even impetuously, repeals itself.This is an excellent description of Trumps progress in the Republican primary. But I think the stunning ease of that progress, the strange defeat of the GOP elite, might be encouraging Sullivan (and others) to overestimate the weakness of the American ruling class writ large, and overstate the vulnerability of our cultural-political power structure our Cathedral, to borrow from the neoreactionaries Ive been writing about of late to a purely populist insurgency.Yes, maybe that wider elite, too, has lost the ability to coordinate against a demagogue; maybe it, too, is so disdained and dismissed by We the People that the public can be persuaded to replace our overclass en masse with Corey Lewandowski and his epigones. But despite (or because of?)its many vices,our power elite actually seemspretty unified and confident in its own cosmopolitan virtue, pretty good at steering public opinion on many controversial issues (including issues in which Sullivan has helped with the steering, from Iraq War cheerleading to anti-Iraq War backlash to Obamamania to the gay marriage juggernaut), pretty confident in its own virtue, and pretty determined to keep a force like Trumpism at bay. Which is to say that Im not sure our democratic culture translates to the kind of uber-democratic politics that Sullivan discerns:I doubt that democratic passions can really carry all before them, and I think to overthrow an elite you cant just mobilize against it; you need that elite to be already paralyzed and fractured, as the G.O.P. elite has been in the face of Trump.And that kind of elite fracturing just seems unlikely once this contest moves from the primary to the general election. Which major donor to the left of Michael Bloomberg is going to sit on their hands rather than give to Hillary, the way that many Republican donors sat on their hands rather than go all-in forCruz and Kasich and even Rubio? How manymainstream media figures are going to go all-in for Trump in the style of Sean Hannity or certain segments of talk radio? (Trump will get obsessive mainstream mediacoverage, buthe already gets that, and all those hours of CNN and the nightly news have delivered him a 30 percent approval rating.) Which apoliticalgurusare going to go to work to build his turnout operation, his voter targeting, his web presence, his ad campaign? Which retired generals and foreign policy hands are going to line up behind him, vouching for his soundness of mind and seriousness of purpose? Which pundit-intellectuals are going to channel their Hillary-skepticism into a full-throated support for Trump? (Not Sullivan, clearly )Maybe none of this matters; maybe the insurrectionary potential of mass democracy is sufficient to propel a demagogueforward against a largely unified elite. ButI think Sullivan inadvertently puts his finger on what a Trumpish figure would actually need in order to complete his conquest, when he compares Trump with Barack Obama circa 2008:Obama would never have been nominated for the presidency, let alone elected, if he hadnt harnessed the power of the web and the charisma of his media celebrity. But he was also, paradoxically, a very elite figure, a former state and U.S. senator, a product of Harvard Law School, and, as it turned out, blessed with a preternaturally rational and calm disposition. So he has masked, temporarily, the real risks in the system that his pioneering campaign revealed The climate Obama thrived in, however, was also ripe for far less restrained opportunists. In 2008, Sarah Palin emerged as proof that an ardent Republican, branded as an outsider, tailor-made for reality TV, proud of her own ignorance about the world, and reaching an audience directly through online media, could also triumph in this new era. She was, it turned out, a John the Baptist for the true messiah of conservative populism, waiting patiently and strategically for his time to come.But surely the fact that Obama was a hugely popular figure who swept to a polarized countrys equivalent of alandslide while Palin and now Trump have extremely low approval ratings suggests that we werent just lucky that Obama was fundamentally an establishmentarian; he was lucky, because even in a late-stage democracy, having the establishment in your corner (up to and including elite centrist journalists like, well, Andrew Sullivan) is still crucial to ridinga populist wave into actual real-world power.So if were worried about the risks of tyranny, what we should fear is a Trump-like figure who could also get the kind of media coverage from allegedly neutral journalists that Obama earned in 2008, who could have every A-list celebrityin his corner and not just the National Enquirer and Bobby Knight and Mike Tyson, who could have all the brightest minds in tech clamoring to be on his team and not just rely on free media (as powerful as that can be), who could be endorsed byOprah and Colin Powell and Michael Bloomberg and not just a parade of has-been hacks, and who could enter office with a compliant establishmentready to back him even to an extra-constitutional hilt.If the republic islucky, such a figure simply couldnt exist, because the power elite simply wouldnt go for someone as angrily demotic as Trump, and theres no easy way to combine his plague on both your houses constituency with the support from the mandarin class that youd need to be an effective Caesar. But this is why I found Jim VandeHeis much-maligned Wall Street Journal op-ed calling for a third party alternative to Trump and Clinton so noteworthy, because in the course of imagining a post-partisan ticket uniting someone from the military with someone from Silicon Valley  a Facebook-Pentagon merger, if you will  he capturedthe reality of what youd need to elect and protect our republics very own Augustus: Not just a wave of popular discontent, but sustained support from some important and officially-apolitical segments of the nations establishment, like the military and the tech industry.Trump wont have that.Figuresas opportunisticasHannity and Huckabee (and Huntsman!)exist beyond the G.O.P., but centrist and center-left opportunistsarent going to see the same advantage in joining his rhinocerias their Republican equivalents. Which is why I keep referring to this entire experience as a kind of dress rehearsalfor a darker future, showing us how authoritarian politics canwork, but with the Republican Partyrather than the entire republic as the stage a Republican Party that precisely because its so vulnerable to a hostile takeover is also a poor launching pad for a takeover of the system as a whole.Now lets just hope Im right."}
{"text": "MIAMI  The large-scale dredging of Miamis port to accommodate the newest generation of freighters, an undertaking that prompted a long-running battle with environmentalists, caused widespread damage to a portion of the areas fragile and already distressed coral reef, according to a new report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The report, based on a December survey undertaken by scientists for the agencys National Marine Fisheries Service, found that as much as 81 percent of the reef near the dredging site was buried in sediment, and an Army Corps of Engineers contractor report from August shows up to 93 percent partial coral death because of sediment, despite a plan by the Corps to minimize the damage.The damage is particularly alarming because the world is rapidly losing its reefs, partly because of global warming, experts say.South Florida has the only coral reef in the continental United States and 80 to 90 percent of it has died or been badly harmed over the years, officials say. The causes include ocean temperatures that have dipped too low or risen too high, acidification, sewage and pollution. Several cycles of white plague disease, including one in 2014 that coincided with the dredge, have also badly hurt South Floridas reef. White plague, a virus that bleaches and kills coral, has been destroying reefs around the world.This Florida reef is as important to our country as the sequoias of California, and we are losing it faster than we can figure out why, said Rachel Silverstein, the executive director of Miami Waterkeeper, a nonprofit environmental organization that has sued the Army Corps of Engineers over coral damage. There are a lot of stressors that are impacting and killing coral reefs, but this is a hyper-local example of something we could easily have prevented.The agencys analysis, obtained by The New York Times, contradicts a December report by the corps, which primarily blamed white plague for the coral damage on reef sections near the dredge. In the corpss report, scientists said that white plague was responsible for 85 percent of the coral deaths in the upper and middle parts of the reef and in the control site, and for 18.3 percent of the deaths of coral closer to shore. The report failed to highlight that 93 percent of the corals closer to the dredge had partially died because of sediment, compared with 7 percent at sites farther away, Ms. Silverstein said.Scientists for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disagreed with the corpss emphasis on white plague disease. Rather, they concluded that the majority of the reef, stretching beyond 3,000 feet, showed conclusive damage to corals by dredging sediment.The agencys survey of the extensive damage comes at a time when Fort Lauderdale is seeking final congressional approval for the dredging of its own port, Port Everglades, one of the largest in the country. The dredging project to deepen the port cleared a crucial Senate committee last week as part of a larger water bill and is headed for the Senate floor. Coral reefs are critical to South Florida because they help lessen the damage from hurricanes, are important to marine biodiversity and lure tourists.Environmentalists have warned Congress and the state that the corpss plan to lessen the damage to corals in that area is flawed because it does not take into account new information, much of it bolstered by state and county scientists, about the extent of the coral damage from the port of Miamis dredge. Expansion of Port Everglades is expected to begin next year.The corps is still working on a final assessment of the Miami dredges effects on the coral, said Susan J. Jackson, a spokeswoman for the agency. Scientists will conduct dives this summer and then analyze their findings in the fall, she added.The results of the assessment will aid us in determining whether any additional mitigation may be needed, she said. As for Port Everglades, Ms. Jackson said in an email that lessons learned from all dredging projects are important, and were taking them into consideration during this process.Ms. Jackson added that the corpss plan to protect the coral near Port Everglades was already an improvement over the Miami strategy. The new plan includes planting 103,000 new nursery-raised corals across 18 acres of reef and relocating existing coral to another five acres.We are confident in the extensive work we have done, Ms. Jackson said.But environmentalists said the plan failed to take into account how much farther than anticipated the sediment spread from the dredge site in Miami, a crucial element. The sediment suffocates coral. They want to see the impact zone extended beyond about 3,000 feet from the site. The Port Everglades plan also relies on a six-year-old survey of staghorn coral, which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.The vast majority of staghorn near the Miami dredge site was never relocated by the corps. Either it was missed in 2010 by contractors during the initial survey of the area, or the staghorn reproduced later. The corps ultimately agreed to rescue the remaining staghorn after a legal fight with Miami Waterkeeper and other groups.It also relocated 924 nonendangered corals. In addition, underwater monitors to measure the sediment failed to work, so the corps relied solely on divers to keep tabs on the coral.This time around, the Waterkeeper group is trying to set up independent monitoring of the coral before dredging begins to keep close track of possible damage.The corps like to say they learned a lot of lessons, and they promise they wont do this again in Port Everglades, Ms. Silverstein said. We would like to see less aspirational talk and more mandatory language protecting these reefs."}
{"text": "As a so-called bathroom break girl at the advertising agency BBDO in 1985, Susan Credle took over for receptionists when they left their desks. When she learned how to type quickly and accurately, she was promoted to secretary. In the decades since, she has become one of the most accomplished women in the industry, holding top executive positions at some of the most esteemed creative agencies. She has been behind numerous memorable campaigns, including the humanlike M&Ms characters and Allstates Mayhem ads.But even today, there are male leaders in the industry who do not acknowledge her. At industry parties, people assume they should be talking to her husband, who is an architect. She tries not to show her emotions at work because when she does, she said, I immediately am looked at as the crazy woman.I still to this day, when I feel the blood boiling in me and I just want to let it all out, I cut it by 90 percent because Im a woman, she said.Women now make up almost 50 percent of those working in the advertising industry, including a relatively small number, like Ms. Credle, in top executive positions. Yet when a female employee of the J. Walter Thompson agency filed a lawsuit in March accusing the companys chief executive of racist and sexist behavior, the accusations brought to the surface what women in the industry had talked about for years: that more than half a century after the Mad Men era, gender bias, while often unspoken or acknowledged, continues to affect how they are treated at work, whom they interact with and what positions they hold.Advertising is far from the only industry that has struggled with issues of sexist behavior and gender bias through the years. But in interviews with more than a dozen women, mostly executives, who work in advertising, many said they found it hard to believe how much their particular business still remained a white mans world. Although some women said they had never personally experienced gender discrimination and referred to it as a thing of the past, many said they repeatedly felt ignored or dismissed by male colleagues and left out socially. They recalled times when they were the only woman in meetings with both co-workers and clients. Some pointed to the ads themselves as examples of how the industrys sexism manifested itself beyond office walls.Yes, there is the rapey talk and the grabby hands, but its that subtle stuff thats chronic and can be more damaging, said Jean Batthany, the executive creative director at DDB Chicago.Nancy Hill, a longtime advertising executive who is now president and chief executive of the 4As, an industry trade group, said that men called her young girl all the time, though she has been working in the business for decades.They dont recognize thats demeaning, she said.Megan Pagliuca, the global chief executive of Omnicoms Accuen agency, said sexism revealed itself in the prevalence of social events like golf outings and drinking events being used for business purposes, a sentiment echoed by several other women interviewed. Women, she said, feel pressure to learn to play golf or to generally act more like their male counterparts or risk missing out on establishing important relationships.Do you try to conform and be like them rather than being yourself, or do you stay strong as who you are and know you are the best operator? Ms. Pagliuca said. A challenge for women is making that choice.Ms. Credle, who has been an executive at the agencies BBDO and Leo Burnett and is now the global chief creative officer for the agency FCB, said that the business meetings masquerading as social outings, like when male colleagues go out for steak dinners or watch a sports game together from a box suite, have at times made her feel like an outsider, even as she has become one of the industrys most powerful creative executives.But even more damaging, Ms. Credle said, is when men ignore her. She recalled standing with two men while waiting to go onstage at an annual advertising conference in March when another man came off the stage. That man, who had just spoken about diversity in the industry, acknowledged the two men with her, but didnt bother to look at me, she said. I felt invisible.There are times when I experienced things that I dont think I would have experienced if I werent a woman, she said. At the same time, however, she emphasized that many men in the industry had helped her succeed and that for her the bad experiences had been rare.Some women also said gender discrimination showed up when looking at the ads that agencies produce. Many ads portray stereotypical gender roles, they said, with mothers in the kitchen, for instance, and men driving cars. Several women noted that only 11 percent of creative directors are women, a statistic from the 3% Conference, which supports female creative leadership at agencies.If all the advertising is being created through that dominant male lens and you look at what the result is, theres a bias in that and theres only one perspective, Ms. Batthany of DDB said.There are also more blatant and aggressive expressions of sexism. Several women described frequent comments about their appearance.Twenty-five percent of women in advertising said they had personally experienced gender discrimination, according to a survey by the 3% Conference. Twenty-three percent said they had personally experienced or witnessed sexual harassment.In the lawsuit filed in March against Gustavo Martinez, the chief executive of J. Walter Thompson, the agencys chief communications officer, Erin Johnson, accused him of subjecting employees to an unending stream of racist and sexist comments as well as unwanted touching and other unlawful conduct. She also contended that Mr. Martinez, who has since resigned, made numerous comments about rape and, on multiple occasions, grabbed Johnson by the throat and by the back of her neck. Mr. Martinez has denied the allegations against him.There is a lot of sex and drugs and rock n roll in the business  there certainly was in those days, said Rosemarie Ryan, a former co-president of J. Walter Thompson North America who now leads the agency Co:Collective, referring to her early career in the 1980s and 1990s. I think there are still some remnants of that.For years, executives have talked about improving diversity and getting rid of gender bias in advertising, but many say progress has been too slow.I think everybody thinks its everybody elses problem, said Bill Koenigsberg, founder and chief executive of Horizon Media.One reason, some executives said, is that there are currently other priorities in advertising, given the pressing challenges that stem from a broad shift in how people consume media. Others said women might be reluctant to call out sexist behavior.Several women said male executives became visibly uncomfortable and ended the conversation when the issue of gender and racial diversity was raised. At the annual advertising conference in March, Maurice Lvy chief executive of the ad giant Publicis said the accusations in the J. Walter Thompson lawsuit were a one-man mistake and not representative of what is happening in our industry. The next day, however, Martin Sorrell, chief of WPP, which owns J.Walter Thompson, said there is a problem and Maurice has a habit of ignoring the facts. Mr. Lvy tried to clarify his comments the following week in an internal memo, calling the allegations in the lawsuit jaw dropping, adding, to such an extent that, in my opinion, they can only represent the unforgivable fault of one man, as opposed to an industrywide evil.Even some women acknowledged that it was difficult for them to address gender bias in the industry. Some of those interviewed declined to provide specifics about examples of gender bias they had seen or experienced because they wanted to protect relationships in the industry.Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB North America, said she had felt more subtle discrimination in her career, but acknowledged that, to rise through the ranks, she has blocked much of it out.The truth is, she said, those of us who have made it through  you become impervious to it in some way."}
{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this piece, Times reporter N.R. Kleinfield provides background on his work covering a woman living with Alzheimers.The disease crouches everywhere, but I didnt have much interest in writing about it. After all, Alzheimers was famous. Everyone knew its brute outlines, knew how drip by drip it transformed someone into someone else.Look around and there it was. Your mother had it. Or your father. Your grandparent. Your aunt. Your golf buddy. The upstairs neighbor with the poodle. The man who made sandwiches at the deli.My mother.My sister, Dawn, and I found out relatively late. It is often that way. Our mother lived alone in New Jersey. Like most older people, she had memory lapses. A neighbor called me. She said my mother was not acting right. Better look in on her.She was a little askew but appeared to be functioning well. A few errands needed to be done. I did them. For a while, she had intermittent bad days but generally seemed all right. A friend visited her a couple of times a week.A few months later, the friend called us and said she was deteriorating. We went over and found opened food containers scattered throughout the kitchen, the house disorderly, mail stacked up, bills unpaid. She was in bed, thin, and had not been eating.We took her to the emergency room. The disease worked fast. Soon she was in a nursing home. Soon she no longer knew us, no longer had the right answers. The sunshine withdrew from her life. After a couple of more years, she died.Yes, I knew Alzheimers. Who didnt?Michael Luo, the editor I work with, has established a little routine to settle on new projects. We each compile a list of about 10 ideas, then we sit down, compare them and see if any light up. There were good ideas and bad ideas and middling ideas.One of Michaels was to follow a person who had just received a diagnosis of Alzheimers.Well, sure, good luck. How would you do that? Learn you have Alzheimers, then invite a reporter to tail you. Really?It is a wicked diagnosis. People retreat from it. It carries an unfortunate stigma, encouraging people to mask their condition until it is impossible to conceal it any longer. They do not want to be cast off, seen as broken.Yet the idea had value. Most of the personal stories I had read about the disease dwelled mainly on its concluding stage. Of course, there would be back story, but the core of most stories was the period when a person had surrendered independence, was reliant on constant home care or was already settled in a nursing home and tuned out from the passing world.The most important stage of Alzheimers, however, is the initial one  the period after diagnosis when people still largely control their lives. Then, considered decisions can be made. Something approximating normality can exist, albeit full of asterisks. But one is also waiting for what comes next. Alzheimers is nothing if not a cruel waiting game.The pace of the disease is unpredictable, but the first stage can last years. I thought it would be illuminating to write a story that, in its entirety, examined the particularities of that introductory stretch, when you meet the disease, decide how to accept it and learn how to work with its evilness. Perhaps it would suggest a road map for others.I broached the idea with what was then the New York chapter of the Alzheimers Association, now called CaringKind. Officials liked the idea. They said they would ask around but cautioned that it might take a long time to find anyone willing and able to cooperate.A month later they invited me to meet Geri and Jim Taylor. What struck me most was how upbeat they were. Ms. Taylor, who had the disease, recognized the jolt to her life, but she was without bitterness or self-pity. Jim was very supportive.I told them the lengthy amount of time I wanted to spend with them. They were excited. They both hated the stigma encasing the disease. They hoped they might help shape a new identity for Alzheimers.One challenge of writing about Alzheimers in its first stage is its invisibility. Its effect is vivid near the end. Not in the beginning. Its internal. One of the frustrations that Ms. Taylor and others have is that when they reveal their condition to people, they are told, You dont seem like theres anything wrong, as if they were playing a prank.I needed someone introspective who could distill what was happening inside the brain. Ms. Taylor was ideal, both bright and reflective. She was not reluctant to talk generously about what the disease was doing to her. In fact, she enjoyed doing so. Her insights enabled me to comprehend the movement of Alzheimers through her mind.Alzheimers is far from a cheerful illness. It eats at ones soul. When I began with Ms. Taylor some two years ago, I did not know what the journey would be like, only her prediction.At the conclusion of that first meeting, when we agreed that we wanted to proceed, she wrapped up the conversation by looking at me with her gentle eyes, flashing her smile and saying, Well, you better be prepared to have fun!Did we ever."}
{"text": "As he inched closer to sewing up the needed delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, Donald J. Trump declared on Monday that he has more foreign policy experience than virtually anyone else in the presidential field.I do deal with leaders around the world, Mr. Trump said on CNNs New Day, when the host, Chris Cuomo, asked him about President Obamas mocking his lack of foreign policy chops at the White House Correspondents Association dinner over the weekend.Ive built a great company, and I deal around  right now, we have hundreds of deals being negotiated all over the world by my company, and I deal with presidents, and I deal with prime ministers. I deal with everybody, Mr. Trump said. I probably have more experience than virtually anybody looking at this office, and I make money. Ive made a lot of money doing it. I built a tremendous company and made a lot of money.When Mr. Cuomo noted that Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and former first lady, might question that claim, Mr. Trump said, Hillary Clinton dealt with other countries, too.

Ive made a fortune going out of this country. Ive made tremendous amounts of money dealing outside of this country.He added, So, you know, dont tell me about that. There is no pushback. I have done a lot of traveling. Ive done a lot of deals outside of this country. I deal at the highest level. And thats good. And thats, you know, as far as Im concerned, I think I have great experience.Mr. Trump also criticized Mrs. Clinton for using the phrase off the reservation, to which some Native American groups took exception, to describe her experience dealing with men such as Mr. Trump.I wont even bring up the fact that the Indians have gone wild on that statement, Mr. Trump said. The Indians have said that that statement is a disastrous statement, and they want a retraction. Im not going to get into that, but  When Mr. Cuomo noted that Mr. Trump had in fact just raised it, Mr. Trump replied, I think its a very nasty statement to men, and if I made that statement, it would be a big, big story.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}

{"text": "Last Wednesday, the CBS chairman, Leslie Moonves, ducked into that nights taping of Stephen Colberts Late Show, and then joined Mr. Colbert in his office above the Ed Sullivan Theater.There Mr. Moonves, Mr. Colbert and the shows new executive producer and showrunner, Chris Licht, broke out a bottle of vodka and toasted their new mission: to get the Late Show on track after an uneven first eight months.It was the first time the three had met since Mr. Moonves persuaded Mr. Colbert to have Mr. Licht join the show two weeks earlier, arguing that Mr. Colberts insistence on personally orchestrating details big and small  lighting, script approval, budgets  was diverting his focus from his own performance and that he needed the help.Mr. Moonves says that his visit was a social call on a fledgling show in which he has great faith. We each had a drink and it was nice, he told me. Just three guys.But, of course, it was more than that. It was about whether they could pull off one of the most intriguing experiments in late-night television history; whether Mr. Colbert, who became a leading voice in American political satire by playing a fictional character on his Comedy Central show  holding forth before a cable congregation of the converted  could succeed as himself in the big broad tent of network television, whose commercial and corporate imperatives can be homogenizing.CBS and Mr. Moonves have hundreds of millions of dollars riding on the result, not to mention corporate pride. Mr. Colbert has something more personal on the line: his reputation as a comedic actor who used his longtime perch at Comedy Central to show how integrity, grace and wicked intelligence could inject something politically powerful  and powerfully funny  into the late-night lineup of stupid pet tricks and vapid celebrity interviews.He shared that reputation with his friend Jon Stewart, who left Comedy Centrals 11 p.m. Daily Show several months after Mr. Colbert left his 11:30 p.m. program, The Colbert Report. In their absence there has been a Where is Superman? aspect to this years presidential campaign, especially in Left America, Centrist-Left America and, yes, Media America.If ever there was an election cycle that called for the sharp satirical analysis that Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert once provided on a nightly basis, it is this one. Their successors, Trevor Noah (The Daily Show) and Larry Wilmore (The Nightly Show) provide their share of edgy satire, but they are relatively new and just starting to build their followings, just as Samantha Bee is on TBSs Full Frontal.John Oliver and Bill Maher have made their marks on HBO, but their shows are not nightly, and have not alleviated the sense that Mr. Colbert and Mr. Stewart are badly missed in the face of all the Trumpmania. Thats why you see headlines such as Calling Jon Stewart: America Needs You Now More Than Ever (the liberal website Daily Kos) or declarations like the one made by the former Variety editor Peter Bart, who said that at the moment of truth  this election  Mr. Colbert and Mr. Stewart hid in their foxholes by leaving Comedy Central.Its pretty odd when you think about it. Its like saying, No one has replaced Stephen Colbert, not even Stephen Colbert, when, in fact, hes on television every weeknight, just not as the jingoistic Conservative talk show host alter ego he employed on Comedy Central.But I found myself feeling the same way a few months ago when Donald J. Trump announced his plan for a total and complete ban on Muslims entering the United States after the San Bernardino terrorist attack. I was curious to see what Mr. Colbert would make of it.I was agog when he opened the show with three lingerie models from a CBS Victorias Secret special that was to air the next night, wearing angels wings and eating hot wings. Even Mr. Colbert appeared to blanch at what came off as an example of corporate synergy gone awry. Toward the end of the bit Mr. Colbert looked at the camera, noted that theres more stuff on the prompter, said something along the lines of The heck with it  but in a way that required bleeping  and cut it short.Mr. Colbert did go on to do a fairly serious soliloquy about the attack. But it was hard to square with the hot wings.CBS officials say they didnt force the Victorias Secret tie-in. But it seemed to typify how a big broadcaster will grab whats special and cool on cable and try pressing it into the advertiser-friendly, safe-for-broad-audiences mold.I sensed the same thing in February, when Mr. Colberts interview with the actor Casey Affleck, there to promote the movie Triple 9, turned into a snippy back and forth over Mr. Afflecks wardrobe. Neither acted as if he wanted to be there for the too-familiar promotional exercise.Mr. Colbert has excelled in interviews with big political gets, like Vice President Joseph Biden and House Speaker Paul Ryan, and people who genuinely interest him, like the energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, who, lets face it, is not the sort of A-lister television executives want to see on their flagship late-night shows, but is typical of many guests on The Colbert Report.Of course Mr. Colbert knew what he signed up for when he took the job David Letterman held for more than two decades. He seemed sincere last August when he told GQ he was eager to shed his Colbert Report character. The great irony is that Mr. Colbert is still learning how to be himself on television after nine years of pretending to be someone else.Mr. Moonves noted that many late-night hosts before Mr. Colbert needed time to adjust to the 11:30 time slot. Theres no way you dont have growing pains, Mr. Moonves said, adding that he has patience for what he expects to be a long-running show. These things are generational, he added. To make some adjustments after eight months makes sense to me, and to Stephen.Things could be worse. Mr. Colbert still places second in overall audience  behind Jimmy Fallon on NBC, and ahead of Jimmy Kimmel on ABC. But Mr. Kimmel has been beating Mr. Colbert among the younger viewers advertisers covet. And as Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, Mr. Colbert is lagging in the new currency of viral videos shared through social media. Beyond that, there is the growing consensus that things just arent clicking.Mr. Moonves has asked Mr. Licht to fix that. Mr. Lichts biggest challenge will be redirecting a tight and loyal team that came with Mr. Colbert to CBS from Comedy Central, and which is known for having an almost religious devotion to the star. Mr. Colbert signed off on Mr. Lichts appointment only after an intense three-hour meeting over drinks at the Parker Meridien hotel bar last month. (It was supposed to be secret but they were spotted by national political reporters staying there for the New York primary.)Mr. Lichts background is in news, not comedy, having come from CBS This Morning, which he gave a new identity and a ratings boost. But he appears to be a Colbert kind of guy  for instance, he made a public pronouncement this year that he wouldnt allow Mr. Trump to do This Morning interviews by phone.Mr. Licht has started by taking over some mechanics of the show that Mr. Colbert was insisting on doing himself, so Mr. Colbert can concentrate on being himself.Now its up to Mr. Colbert to decide who that is  and for CBS to let him."}

{"text": "FOR all his purported business acumen, it seems the woman card may not be as valuable as Donald J. Trump thinks: In Maryland on Tuesday, Representative Chris Van Hollen beat Representative Donna Edwards in the Democratic primary race for the Senate seat to be vacated by Barbara Mikulski.In her concession speech, Ms. Edwards railed against the hypocrisy of a party that relies on black female votes but has sent only one black woman to the Senate. What I want to know from my Democratic Party is, when will the voices of people of color, when will the voices of women, when will the voices of labor, when will the voices of black women, when will our voices be effective, legitimate equal leaders in a big-tent party? she asked.If Ms. Edwards had gone on to win in November, she would have been the first black woman in the Senate in more than 15 years.She raises a crucial question, and one that Democrats, even as they come closer to nominating Hillary Clinton, have been bad at answering. Democrats and liberals generally agree that representation matters. This is the party that supports affirmative action, that champions diversity, that pays lip service to getting more women and minorities represented in public office. But does representation matter over other factors?For emphasizing her life story, Ms. Edwards was accused of playing the race card. According to Mr. Trump, Hillary Clinton is playing the woman card, ostensibly by being a woman herself. The implication: In a country that has never had a female president and where it was a record for women to secure 20 out of 100 Senate seats, womanhood confers some sort of unearned advantage.The idea that politicians should reflect the diversity of their constituents is not just about representation for representations sake. There is evidence that female politicians are more effective than male ones, bringing more money to their home districts and getting more co-sponsorship for their legislation. Politicians personal experiences and their lens on life also influence their legislative priorities and electoral strategy.A female candidate, for example, may be less inclined to enthusiastically accept an endorsement from a convicted rapist, as Mr. Trump did last week. Or a female legislator may be more likely to see contraception access as an economic and health issue rather than a moral one.A more diverse class of elected officials is crucial in effectively representing the Democrats voter base. But its also about changing the norms that keep women and minorities out of power in the first place.One of the most stubborn barriers to getting women into positions of power, whether in the workplace or on Capitol Hill, is that authority, competence and power are perceived to be male qualities. Just being named John instead of Jennifer makes potential employers view you as more competent. A similar dynamic appears to exist for African-Americans: Research on typically white or African-American names and hiring has shown that employers view Emily or Greg more favorably than Lakisha or Jamal.In Maryland, there were plenty of reasons voters, and much of the Democratic establishment, supported Mr. Van Hollen. He is pro-choice and a reliable progressive who demonstrated significant skill in getting things done in a notoriously do-nothing Congress. Many found him more likable than Ms. Edwards, who was routinely cast as difficult and self-serving (one challenge for successful women: The more authoritative they are, the less theyre liked and the more theyre perceived as out for themselves).Mr. Van Hollen was also the presumed natural successor to Ms. Mikulskis seat in the Senate (one benefit for white men: It is easier to fit in naturally when you look like the majority of the current personnel). There are always reasons a woman is good, but not as good as a man: In the John/Jennifer employment study, potential employers always had a gender-neutral justification for picking John over Jennifer, it was just that when John had more education and Jennifer more experience, employers wanted more education; when John had more experience and Jennifer more education, they wanted more experience.Fighting these pervasive, subconscious prejudices requires not only being aware of them, but also changing the archetypes of power. The only way to do that is to put more women, and especially more minority women, in positions of influence and authority, so that influence and authority become normal instead of noteworthy.Issues should override identity, but we cant pretend that representative leadership doesnt matter. Black women, Ms. Edwards said last week, have long been standing on the outside propping up the Democratic Party. Whether theyre invited to the leadership table, she said, is the 21st century question. The problem is that the very preconceptions we could fight by putting women and minorities in power are the same ones keeping them out of it.We cant change longstanding assumptions about what a leader looks like unless we change what leaders look like. That means a party dedicated to diversity must champion politicians who arent white men  even if theres a white man who is equally qualified, or the obvious choice.Right now, the woman card and the race card are broadly seen as cynical tactics. Democrats should make them central components of a winning hand."}
{"text": "This is really depressing: Sanders claiming that there will be a contested convention, and suggesting that the nomination fight was rigged. Can someone tell Bernie that hes in the process of blowing his own chance for a positive legacy?Heres how the narrative could have run: although he fell short of actually getting the nomination, Sanders did far better than expected, giving him and his movement a good claim to have a big say in the Democratic agenda for 2016 and perhaps setting the movement up as the partys future. But to take that position  to turn defeat in the primary into a moral victory  he would have had to accept the will of the voters with grace.What were getting instead is an epic descent into whining. He dismissed Clinton victories driven by black voters as products of the conservative Deep South; he suggested that his defeat in New York was unfair because it was a closed primary (you can argue this case either way, but requiring that you identify as a Democrat to choose the Democratic nominee is hardly voter suppression  arguably caucuses are much further from a democratic process); then, with the big loss in the mid-Atlantic primaries,he has turned to a sort of fact-free complaint that any process under which Bernie Sanders loses is ipso facto unfair, and superdelegates should choose him despite a 3 million vote deficit.At this point its as if Sanders is determined to validate everything liberal skeptics have been saying all along about his unwillingness to face reality  and all of it for, maybe, a few weeks of additional fundraising, at the expense of any future credibility and goodwill. Isnt there anyone who can tell him to stop before its too late?"}
{"text": "LEICESTER, England  Soccer-crazed, working-class Leicester is verging on one of those ridiculous seasons, an unimaginable championship that was given worse betting odds at the start than finding Elvis alive.This is rags-to-riches, Rocky and the impossible dream for an unglamorous city in the middle of England best known for having buried Richard III. Now it is getting the kind of recognition that will live on for decades in the fervent, tribal world of English soccer.The Leicester City Foxes were nearly dropped from the Premier League a year ago, but with a middling payroll and few stars the team could now embarrass celebrity rivals including Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.Before this, no one knew who we were, said Kimberley Rayner, 21, hoarse from screaming at the televisions in the hugely overcrowded Counting House pub here on Sunday. A frenetic, heaving mass of supporters saw the Foxes come back to tie mighty Manchester United 1-1, which felt like a victory, especially without their unlikely star, Jamie Vardy, who was sitting out a suspension.You cant put words to it, Ms. Rayner said, asserting that she has been a supporter since her birth, which was exactly at kickoff of a match. Its not about the money  our whole team gets paid what some of these stars get  but passion and dreams.Karen Fox, 56, said she had attended her first Leicester City game at 10, when it cost 25 pence to get in and 5 pence for a program. Now she happily pays more than 415 in British pounds, or about $605, a year for season tickets.Its the victory of the underdog, isnt it? her spouse, Jenny Fox, said. Thats what everyone loves, that anything can happen. Leicesters season, she said, was almost better than Britains law permitting them to marry, after many years together.Chris Marquis, 32, came here from Toronto, after being recruited to Leicester Law School. I didnt know anything about Leicester, but a friend told me on Facebook that they dont have a very good soccer team, he said, managing a pint of lager in one hand and a toddler in the other. I just went back and sent him a note: You were saying? Leicesters winning the Premier League, he said, would be like a Canadian Football League team winning the N.F.L.Leicester, 100 miles north of London, is one of Englands oldest cities, founded 2,000 years ago, and is among its most diverse, with more than 50 percent of its 330,000 inhabitants estimated now to be nonwhite. Twenty percent of the population is Muslim, and almost 20 percent is Hindu or Sikh.But the people here rub together, with more Asian supporters for soccer than in most English cities  the team is owned by a Thai, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who made millions from duty-free shopping  and a significant reputation for tolerance.In fact, Leicester, which is pronounced here as LESS-tah, is better known for rugby.But a soccer team has played here since 1894, and its highest finish previously was in 1929  second place in Division One, the predecessor to the Premier League. Now, if Tottenham loses to Chelsea on Monday night, Leicester will be champion, and can win the league regardless at home against Everton on Saturday.The team is made up of players who were mostly dumped from richer, more star-studded teams. Even its Italian coach, Claudio Ranieri, 64, is considered a dull journeyman, known as the Tinkerman for constantly fiddling with his lineup. When he left Chelsea in 2004, his successor, the star coach Jos Mourinho, said he had been hired because the team wanted to win.Mr. Mourinho, who won it all last year for Chelsea, was fired in December, and Chelsea now sits 10th in the league, while Mr. Ranieri is hailed as a patient genius. At least until next season, when the bigger, richer teams could play closer to their potential and the fairy dust on Leicester could blow away.For now, it all seems magical, even divine. At Leicester Cathedral, the statue of Richard III  whose remains, found in a parking lot, were buried in the cathedral with great ceremony last year after a squabble with York  wore a Leicester City scarf.The Rev. Peter Hobson said the attention was wonderful for the city, and created enormous good feeling after a week when memories of the disaster in 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium, when 96 soccer fans were crushed through police incompetence, filled the headlines with the findings of a new inquest.Hillsborough is the tragedy of football, and Leicester City is the opposite, Mr. Hobson said. For some people who say, Football isnt a matter of life and death, its more important, this has been powerful.Of course, he added, the tragedy in Syria matters more than football, but even if football doesnt mean as much, its still important.Mr. Hobson then cited a common feeling of mystery here, that as soon as Richard III was buried, the fortunes of Leicester City, flirting with relegation, took their extraordinary turn, while the York City Football Club, he said with a benevolent smile, is right down at the bottom of the second league.Leicester is basking in recognition, he said. Weve always been what we are, and now people recognize us for it.I think this is once in a lifetime, Mr. Hobson said. Who knows about next year?For now, no one here cares."}

{"text": "INDIANAPOLIS  As the presidential race came to Indiana, candidates of both parties seized on a fresh example in this industrial state of factory jobs being shipped abroad.Is anyone here from Carrier? Donald J. Trump called out in Evansville, Ind., last week, referring to the Carrier Corporations closing of factories that make heating and air-conditioning units. They let go of 1,400 people to move to Mexico, Mr. Trump said. And you know what? They have to pay a consequence.At a union rally the next day at the State Capitol, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont thundered a message to the chief executive of United Technologies, Carriers parent company. Stop the greed, he shouted. Stop destroying the middle class in America! Respect your workers!The picture of manufacturing decline and middle-class retreat has become a driving narrative of the presidential race, spawning economic populism on both the left and the right.Yet Indiana, which holds its primary on Tuesday, defies an easy picture of Rust Belt decline. By many measures, the state is humming economically, offering a contrarian reality to the gloomy scenario that the presidential candidates are presenting to motivate voters.With nearly one in five jobs in manufacturing, the highest share of any state, Indianas gross domestic product is accelerating faster than any of its Great Lakes neighbors, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department.Unemployment at the end of last year was 4.4 percent, below the national average of about  5 percent. Even though the figure has ticked up in 2016, economists attribute the increase to the large number of people returning to the work force, including job seekers moving to Indiana.Factories in heavily industrial Elkhart County, a center of recreational vehicle manufacturing where unemployment has been significantly reduced, have resorted to calling a homeless shelter to look for workers.The Indianapolis region is growing faster than Chicago, Cleveland or Detroit, and personal income statewide rose 3.6 percent last year, faster than the national average.The economy here in terms of the data is as good as its been in a generation, said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind.Mr. Hicks said that if measured by the value of goods produced, manufacturing has never been stronger in Indiana. The boom in the auto industry has played a big role in this because of the many parts factories in the state.Factory jobs have declined, he added, but not because of trade deals with other countries as Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders assert, but because Indiana factories are increasingly efficient and fewer workers are needed.Manufacturing employment peaked in 1973, he said, adding that since then the productivity of Indiana factory workers has climbed 250 percent. We need far fewer workers, and a very different type of worker, too.In Warsaw, Ind., for example, a global center for manufacturing orthopedic devices, the workers are highly specialized.Despite increases in productivity, wages have stagnated in step with national trends, feeding widespread anxiety about the future. Candidates in both parties have channeled these fears at targets ranging from immigration to trade deals to the government.And Indiana economists point to pockets of weakness within the state. Like other Midwestern states, Indianas rural counties are emptying: Of the states 92 counties, 54 lost population in 2015, according to the Business Research Center at Indiana University.Connersville in Fayette County, which was once called Little Detroit, they had close to 2,000 manufacturing jobs and now are down to about 400, said Timothy Slaper, an economist at Indiana Universitys Kelley School of Business.Patti and Richard Schwalm, owners of a machine shop in rural Henry County, an hours drive east of Indianapolis, said they had to cut their staff to three employees in recent years. They blamed President Obama for hurting the manufacturers that are their clients.The Schwalms plan to vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary. Pressed for details about Obama administration policies that hurt manufacturing, Ms. Schwalm acknowledged, The problems we have are 50 years in the making.Todd Witte, who works in a factory in Fort Wayne, Ind., plans to vote on Tuesday for Mr. Sanders because of the senators opposition to trade deals and his history of walking union picket lines. If Mr. Sanders is not the Democratic nominee, Mr. Witte said, he will probably vote for Mr. Trump if he is nominated. I like his views on the Second Amendment, he said. In our local, theyre either Bernie Sanders or Trump supporters.Mr. Witte was in attendance on Friday when Mr. Sanders addressed members of his union, the United Steelworkers, who were protesting the Carrier layoffs.Even as Mr. Sanders delivered a stem-winding speech about the cost of trade deals, many union members in the crowd who did not work for Carrier said they were personally doing fine.Mr. Wittes plant, owned by Dana Holding Corporation, plans to grow to 900 hourly workers from 535 in the next few years, according to Tom Herendeen, president of the United Steelworkers Local 903, who also attended the rally. Were doing great, he said. We have a lot of new business coming in.Carriers decision to lay off 2,100 workers at two factories gained national attention in February when a video of an executive icily delivering the news to workers generated more 3.5 million views.Mr. Trump took to criticizing the company and threatening high tariffs that he promised would force Carrier to reverse itself. Theyre going to call me and say, Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana, he told the crowd.His protectionist policies, which go against decades of Republican orthodoxy, have brought the issue of trade and its potential costs to workers to the fore of the presidential race. Hillary Clinton has backed off her earlier support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, and during a visit here she vowed to take on China for dumping steel.Because the loss of manufacturing jobs has many factors and predates the latest international trade deals and the rise of China, economists say that steep new tariffs, such as those promised by Mr. Trump, will not restore jobs.Mr. Hicks, the Ball State economist, predicted that Indiana will have 125,000 new openings in manufacturing jobs, in part because of retirements, each year in the next decade. By way of comparison, he wrote in a blog post, we will only have 70,000 high school graduates per year."}

{"text": "Bran Stark, missing in action since the end of Season 4 of Game of Thrones, makes his return to the story on Sunday night.The eldest remaining Stark son, played by Isaac Hempstead-Wright, spent all of Season 5 offscreen, training in a cave under a tree with the Three-Eyed Raven, a mystical guru played in Season 6 by Max von Sydow. There Bran has been developing and refining metaphysical powers that will play a significant role in the story, including abilities to warg into the psyches of animals and to have visions of the past, the future, and of distant events, a gift known as greensight in the Thrones world.When we meet him in Season 6, hes no master yet but he can do some really cool things with his power, Mr. Hempstead-Wright said. (In Luke Skywalker terms, he added, Bran has gone to Dagobah.)The actor, 17, spent the year off on his schooling. Im still maintaining a fairly normal existence, he said. But he allowed that his more active role in Season 6 kind of clinched the notion that hed like to keep acting even after his time on Game of Thrones is over.Previously I was always like, Im no actor, he said. But now Ive thought, no, I do really enjoy this.Mr. Hempstead-Wright recently discussed returning to Game of Thrones, Brans role in the story and Hodor jokes. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Whats in store for Bran this season?This destiny of his has been calling ever since the very first season. There have been hints of what these powers he possesses might be, and what they might be able to do, but theyve been always kind of vague windows into it for a brief few seconds. So Bran has never had a chance to do his thing. Every character has their particular strength and Bran has been trying to get to his for the past five seasons. So when he gets there, finally, its an opportunity for him to completely immerse himself in this new kind of character. Hes got his own calling and his own sense of self, and his own very important place in the world of Westeros.What is Brans role in the story as a whole?That kind of gets explored this season. I dont think hes necessarily going to be the king, and hes not a vengeful character either. I feel like hell be an enabler. Hell be the kind of person who can sit around with this kind of Zen Mother Nature type control over the whole kingdom, and keep everything in order and in balance. Thats what his place is. I feel like hes kind of the key unlocking the world, really, and freeing it of all the tension and warring.Is there anything that was surprising about this season?The way its all tying up this year. Game of Thrones has always been this vast, sprawling network of story lines that maybe cross for one second and then shoot off. But this season theyre all starting to look like theyre coming back toward a central focal point and pave the way for epic, epic things.After taking a year off from the show, as an actor were you able to pick up where you left off?There was definitely a period of readjustment. I felt like it in that year Game of Thrones grew more vast and phenomenal. Coming back onto it was like, Wow, has it changed? Will anyone remember me? Am I still a part of this? Id also forgotten how to act, pretty much. It was like, Right! Now I remember. Theres the cameras, got it.What it was like to work with Max von Sydow?It was really quite extraordinary. Hes such a gentleman. Hes quite old and frail now  hes 87. But his presence on set is astounding. A kind of hush descends upon the room and everyone is just kind of watching him create magic with his voice and his words and the character.In Brans visions he can walk. Was that nice for a change?Oh, it was really nice to walk. Although after a day or two of walking around on a set, it was like, Actually, you know what? Can I get back in the cave and lie down for a bit? I actually fell asleep.Does Hodor still carry you around?Well, were just sitting around. Luckily he doesnt have to pick me up because it would look really silly. My legs would be dragging across the ground.Hodor jokes have probably gotten old by now, but do you guys still make them on the set?Oh yeah. Every now and again someone will kick off a Hodor, and then it will kind of bounce around the entire set. Hodor! Hodor. HODOR!"}
{"text": "INDIANAPOLIS  Bernie Sanders capped off a day of campaigning around Indiana on Monday with a boisterous and energetic rally in downtown Indianapolis.Mr. Sanderss voice sounded particularly hoarse as he railed against income inequality, with many of his supporters reciting parts of his now familiar speech along with him. The rally was one of three he held in Indiana on Monday to court the states voters, who go to the polls on Tuesday, and stress the states importance in his push to win the Democratic presidential nomination.Although the chances have narrowed for the Vermont senator, his supporters were as lively as ever on Monday night, shouting his name and waving signs throughout his speech.Our ideas are the future of America, Mr. Sanders said to loud cheers. Our ideas are the future of the Democratic Party.A victory in Indiana, where polls show that Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton are in a tight race, could help him regain some momentum after tough losses last week on the East Coast. On Monday, Mr. Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he was counting on them to add to his victories.Tomorrow let us see Indiana have the largest voter turnout in its history, Mr. Sanders said at his Indianapolis event. Tomorrow let us see Indiana help lead this country into the political revolution.In Evansville earlier on Monday, Mr. Sanders emphasized that he needed big wins to clinch the nomination. He also said the election system disadvantages insurgent candidates like himself, lamenting that he has been able to get only a small fraction of superdelegates to support him.As of today, in what I call earned delegates, the delegates that you earn after a primary or a caucus, we have won about 45 percent of them, Mr. Sanders said of pledged delegates. There are 10 states left and we have to earn over 50 percent of those delegates and thats what the importance of Indiana is. And we are going to fight as hard as we can for every vote.The senator also made his pitch at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne as well, casting his platform as crucial to achieving health care for all Americans, combating climate change and reforming the campaign finance system.Together we are going to change our national priorities, he said.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}

{"text": "Donald Trump has gone from blaming Bernie Sanderss supporters for disruptions at his rallies to making overtures to them  saying Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats, saying that he would harvest attacks on Hillary Clinton from Sanderss speeches, and even urging Sanders to run as an independent.And, to take it further, CNN reported Friday that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the campaign is ready to bring into the fold anyone in the feel the Bern movement who is not inclined to support Clinton in the general election.The network quoted Lewandowski as saying:You have two candidates in Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders which have reignited a group of people who have been disenfranchised and disappointed with the way Washington, D.C., and career politicians have run the country  Bernie Sanders has large crowds  not as large as Mr. Trumps, but large crowds  and so there is a level of excitement there for people about his messaging and we will bring those people in.This is a fascinating political ploy, but rife with folly.First, it is important to acknowledge that both movements are born of the same populist source: white working- and middle-class voters fear, anger, anxiety and disappointment over what they see as a broken political system, beholden to moneyed interests and oblivious to their pain, suffering and rage.According to a Pew Research Center report published on March 31, Trumps supporters are more likely than supporters of his Republican opponents to say that life in the United States has gotten worse for people like them compared with 50 years ago, and Sanderss supporters were more likely than Clintons supporters to say the same. But still, there was a 40-point gap between the percentage of Trump and Sanders supporters agreeing with that sentiment.This is a largely white American lament. A majority of white voters believe that things have gotten worse, while a majority of black voters and a plurality of Hispanic voters believe that things have gotten better for people like them in the last 50 years. It is these more optimistic minorities who have formed the bedrock of Clintons support and pushed her within striking distance of securing the nomination.Furthermore, the Pew report found that Trumps and Sanderss supporters were the most likely on their respective sides of the ideological divide to be angry at the government; believe that the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests; and are more isolationist, believing that Americas involvement in global problems makes those problems worse.And lastly, there is an implicit, or even explicit, critique of President Obama present in both camps, which seem to see him as a disappointment: either as feckless or fainthearted, either because he went too far or not far enough, either because he was not tough enough with our international adversaries or not tough enough with his congressional opponents.This view of the Obama presidency as, at best, a disappointment, or at worst, a failure, is a pernicious and unsupportable lie that did quite a bit to sour minorities on Sanders and to rally opposition to Trump.Obama wasnt perfect. He didnt accomplish all that he thought he would or could. He made mistakes. But, all told, he was true to the deliberative, center-left pragmatist that he has always been.Indeed, according to PolitiFact, Obama has kept twice as many promises as he has broken.He was never a superhero, but some of the hurt feelings come from him allowing people to believe that he was. As Obama wrote in the prologue to The Audacity of Hope: I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views. The thing is, he did not become what some people projected. He remained himself.That said, these Trump and Sanders supporters are looking at the dragon from different vantage points and seeing fundamentally different dangers.Trumps supporters seem to see a country in decline, a government that is out of control and incompetent, an influx of immigrants that represent an existential threat and a culture that is hamstrung by political correctness.Conversely, Sanderss supporters see a democracy slipping into oligarchy, a country that has utterly failed to keep pace with its global peers on social structure issues  economic equality, taxation, health care and education  and has gone completely off the rails on many others, like criminal justice and mass incarceration.These are not crowds that are likely to lie down together. Indeed, I would imagine that Trumps brand of xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia, misogyny and fascism would not go down easily with the faction of left progressives that swell the ranks of Sanderss supporters.Indeed, The Washington Post reported in March:Polling shows little evidence that Trump has a shot to win large pockets of Sanders voters in November, should Clinton maintain her lead and win the Democratic nomination. Among Democratic-leaning voters who  prefer Sanders to win the party nod, only 13 percent have a favorable view of Trump, compared to 86 unfavorable, according to a Washington Post-ABC News national poll earlier this month.If these numbers are correct, any substantial Trump-Sanders coalition is a nonstarter."}

{"text": "Rick DiPietro is delighted to say that his 15-month-old son, Milo, often greets the day with a mini hockey stick and ball, which he uses to score lots of goals.The only regret is that I wish I had him when I was playing, DiPietro said recently. Hes obsessed with hockey.Although he said he has not filed retirement papers, DiPietro, 34, has not played a competitive game since nearly two and a half years ago, when he told the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League that he was abandoning a comeback attempt after five games.Its probably safe to say no return is coming soon, he said.DiPietro, a goaltender who was the No. 1 overall choice in the 2000 entry draft, was so prone to injury during his 10-year, 318-game N.H.L. career, all with the Islanders, that he adopted as his Twitter handle @HDumpty39, as in the Humpty Dumpty who had a great fall.He is now on the daily sports-talk show Hahn and Humpty on ESPN Radio in New York. He is partnered with Alan Hahn, who used to cover DiPietro and the Islanders for Newsday. A television highlight version of the show is to run on MSG Network this summer.Hes a natural, just like his days as an athlete, said Hahn, who is also an analyst on Knicks telecasts on MSG. In fact, he treats this job much like he does a sport: He has great passion, puts in great preparation and is a quick study. You rarely see that when a pro athlete moves into this side of the business.Three years ago, the Islanders bought DiPietro out of a then-record 15-year, $67.5 million contract that he had signed in 2006. He is to receive $1.5 million annually through 2029.Id rather be playing, he said. Im more disappointed than anything that I wasnt able to prove to everyone that I was worth the deal.His new career has taken an interesting turn. In addition to the radio show, DiPietro was hired by MSG to serve as a commentator before, during and after Islanders telecasts. NBC has taken over for the Stanley Cup playoffs, but DiPietro is working a postgame show on MSG.Weve all been impressed with Ricks ability to connect and engage with fans with his fresh, bold and insightful analysis, Andrea Greenberg, president and chief executive of MSG Networks, wrote in an email. Rick has taken broadcasting very seriously, and were happy to have him as part of our esteemed talent team.But DiPietro is still very much an Islander. When John Tavares scored in the second overtime against the Panthers last week to lift the Islanders to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 1993  nearly eight years before DiPietros first N.H.L. game  he was at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, watching the game.He remembers jumping into the arms of a security guard after the goal. Tavares, the Islanders No. 1 overall draft choice in 2009, could well have been a teammate. The 15-year contract DiPietro signed in 2006 would have had several years remaining.In a perfect world, Id be playing for the team, but that didnt work out, DiPietro said.He said he still considered himself to be an unabashed Islanders fan, but he added, Im just trying to be objective.Its something I try to do, regardless of the sport, he said.Of the radio show, he said, The Rangers fans tell me all the time, We hated you when you were playing for the Islanders, but we love you on the radio.DiPietro grew up in Winthrop, Mass., near Logan International Airport, and went to Boston University after playing at St. Sebastians School in Needham. He was at B.U. for one season, compiling an 18-5-5 record, before the Islanders drafted him.Hours earlier, they traded goaltender Roberto Luongo to Florida in a four-player deal. Luongo, 37, a first-round pick of the Islanders in 1997, has played in nearly 1,000 games in his N.H.L. career  the most recent, in a twist, being the Panthers playoff loss to the Islanders and Tavares.DiPietros playing career was shattered by injuries, especially after he signed the long-term contract. When the Islanders made a gallant last-week run to the playoffs in 2007, a journeyman goaltender, Wade Dubielewicz, led the team to a postseason berth.I always thought I would get into coaching, said DiPietro, who played 175 games after signing the contract.When Hahn started filling in on a sports-talk show on ESPN Radio two summers ago, DiPietro often called in. Hahn asked DiPietro to come into the studio. The two clicked.I like to talk, DiPietro said. Theres something in my personality that really enjoys talking.For both his radio and television gigs, DiPietro is articulate, but he is also sincere and thoughtful, saying, When youre doing a radio show three hours a day, five days a week, you cant fake it.Along the way, DiPietro has gained a new audience. Before the decisive Islanders-Panthers game in the first round, he wore a jacket with a camouflage pattern to emphasize that the Islanders had to battle to move to the next round.When he signed the 15-year contract, he hoped to lead the Islanders to their first Stanley Cup since 1983. Now, Tavares, 25, drives the team. DiPietro has a much smaller role.Youre really trying to capture what its like for the people who casually follow the sport and are just tuning in, DiPietro said. You teach people the sport."}
{"text": "Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBCs reality television show The Biggest Loser, shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months.When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a T-shirt and knee-length shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model.Ive got my life back, he declared. I mean, I feel like a million bucks.Mr. Cahill left the shows stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds.But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his 5-foot-11 frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that seasons 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now.Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose.Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the Biggest Loser contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise.The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss.It is frightening and amazing, said Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. I am just blown away.It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes.Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that The Biggest Loser contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended.What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight.Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat.The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nations obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on weight-loss drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology.Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is new and important.The key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you cant get away from a basic biological reality, said Dr. Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. As long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back.The shows doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestants metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off.Unfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  and thats something we all need to work hard to change, he said in an email.The studys findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people.The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life.Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off.There is always a weight a persons body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  it may be an effect of aging  at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail.Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Childrens Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense.This is a subset of the most successful dieters, he said. If they dont show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?Still, he added, that shouldnt be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches.Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity.There is a lot of basic research we still need to do, said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin.While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert, a full-time caregiver for her mother in Versailles, Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size.What people dont understand is that a treat is like a drug, said Ms. Egbert, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. Two treats can turn into a binge over a three-day period. That is what I struggle with.Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N.I.H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N.I.H.The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot.All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight, Mr. Cahill said. The moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, This is not right. Something is wrong with my body.Sean Algaier, 36, a pastor from Charlotte, N.C., feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size.Its kind of like hearing you have a life sentence, he said.Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the seasons finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat.Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a one-year study funded by Australias National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back.Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose.What was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is, Dr. Proietto said. The body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with long-term use.Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame.Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485.I used to look at myself and think, I am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman, he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt; stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating.I remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, I should just run out in front of a car.He eventually seized on The Biggest Loser as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected.Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the Biggest Loser ranch with the other contestants, Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day, burning 8,000 to 9,000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before.Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own.Mr. Cahill set a goal of a 3,500-caloric deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it.His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a.m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes; bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise.If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his calorie-burn indicator reset to zero at midnight.On the day of the weigh-in on the shows finale, Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in.Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back.Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295.His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. Id eat five bites. Then Id black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, What did I do?Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity researcher at Harvard, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories.Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the bodys systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on.We eat about 900,000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3,000 to 5,000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds, he said. These very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  less than one Starburst candy  but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating.It is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging, Dr. Rosenbaum added.The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out.He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day.Those extra calories, Dr. Hall said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. Unless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight, he said.All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  low-carbohydrate or low-calorie diets, for example  and to exercise and weight-loss drugs, among other interventions.But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. There are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories, he said, but he added that for most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months.Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting two-thirds of the U.S.A., he said.Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. Halls group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain.That shame that was on my shoulders went off, he said."}
{"text": "The Jungle Book sold more tickets in its third weekend in North American theaters than three new wide-release films  Keanu, Mothers Day and Ratchet & Clank  managed to sell combined in their first.Now ranking No. 1 for three weeks running, The Jungle Book (Disney) collected an estimated $42.4 million, for a new domestic total of $252 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Disney also had a blockbuster weekend overseas, where The Jungle Book took in $57.1 million, for a foreign total of $432.7 million, and Captain America: Civil War, which starts screening in the United States Thursday night, began to roll out, collecting $200.2 million.Keanu, a well-reviewed comedy starring Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, a pair who have been a hit on TV but have never before appeared in a movie together, failed to break out. It took in about $9.4 million, below what Warner Bros. and its New Line unit had hoped for before release. Some analysts had anticipated up to $15 million in initial ticket sales. Keanu cost about $15 million to make.Mothers Day (Open Road), with a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson and a badly bewigged Julia Roberts, took in a humdrum $8.3 million; Mothers Day cost at least $25 million to make. And the animated Ratchet & Clank, released by Focus Features on its Gramercy label, flopped with $4.8 million in ticket sales, becoming the latest example of a popular video game that failed to translate on the big screen."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  There is a sequence in the movie Beverly Hills Cop in which three men carry a protesting Eddie Murphy across the lobby of a building and fling him through a window. Glass scatters everywhere, and within seconds, a police car pulls up.When the officers tell him to stand and put his hands on the hood, an incredulous Murphy asks what he is being charged with.Disturbing the peace, he is told.That scene came to mind 4 minutes 13 seconds into the first period Saturday night at Verizon Center, where whatever sliver of peace that existed during the Washington Capitals playoff series with the Pittsburgh Penguins vanished.After Penguins defenseman Olli Maatta released a shot on goal, Washington defenseman Brooks Orpik leveled him with a late shoulder to the head, causing him to fall backward. Two teammates helped Maatta up and off the ice, and he wobbled down a tunnel, not to be seen for the rest of Pittsburghs 2-1 series-evening victory, and perhaps even longer.As for Orpik, he skated over to an official, apparently dubious of any transgression, and then to the penalty box.Two minutes.For interference.By the letter of the N.H.L. rule book, Orpik did interfere with Maatta  with his cognitive functions. The immediate punishment evoked Murphys response as police officers shoved him in the back seat: If he had been pushed out of a moving car, what would he be charged with then? Jaywalking?It was the type of hit, reckless and indefensible, that warranted a five-minute match penalty. It was the type of hit that ratchets up the nastiness quotient beyond the standard hostility that develops between rivals during the course of a series.I thought it was a target to his head, said Pittsburgh Coach Mike Sullivan, who, though teammates suggested Maatta had sustained a concussion, did not offer any updates on his condition except to say that he was not optimistic that he would play Monday. Its the type of hit that everyone in hockey is trying to remove from the game.It was the type of hit, particularly in this age of increased concussion awareness, that merits swift action from the league, whose department of player safety reactedon Sundayby suspending Orpik for three games, beginning with Game 3Monday night in Pittsburgh.In a video explaining its ruling, the N.H.L. said that Maatta should not have been expecting to be hit, and that Orpik, entirely in control on the play, administered a blow that was unacceptably high and excessively late.It looked bad  I mean, you could word it however you want, said the Penguins star center Sidney Crosby, who missed parts of two seasons because of concussion symptoms. He added: To see your teammate in that bad situation and see him stumbling, you know its not good. I dont think you ever get used to seeing that.But more than anything, it was also the type of hit that Orpik should be sensitive about. On April 18, Orpik was rammed into the glass by a hard  but legal  check from Philadelphia center Ryan White and crumpled to his knees, dazed.As ugly as his hit on Maatta seemed, it was Orpiks reaction  his lack of responsiveness, his distant stare while being helped up  that looked worse, and scarier.Orpik missed the final three games against Philadelphia, and sat out for 10 days, cleared a few hours before Game 1 against the Penguins on Thursday night. He will miss time again, now because of his own doing.The Capitals declined requests to make Orpik available to the news media on Saturday night, but his coach, Barry Trotz, after speaking with him, relayed an explanation mired in half-truths.Even if, as Trotz said, Orpik thought Maatta might emerge from his crouch, and even if Orpik did not intend to hit him that high, there is no possible reason, based on the angle of the shot, for thinking the puck would carom back to where Maatta was.If you know anything about Brooks, he plays hard, he plays clean, hes not a dirty player, Trotz said. The Pittsburgh people know that.Across his 13-year career, Orpik has fashioned a reputation as rugged and reliable, beloved by teammates but a nuisance to everyone else. He spent the first 11 seasons in Pittsburgh, where he mentored Maatta, now 21, who also has a history of concussions. So does Kris Letang, whom Orpik punched in the head in the second period. No penalty was called.If theyre going to let that go, its fine, Letang said. Its going to be equal for every team.Orpiks was the third suspension levied this postseason for excessive force. All have involved Washington. The Flyers received the first two suspensions, and they were well deserved: for Pierre-Edouard Bellemares brutal hit from behind on Dmitry Orlov and Brayden Schenns charging T. J. Oshie.Philadelphia was the aggressor in that series, compensating for its comparative lack of skill and depth by striving to agitate the Capitals, who for whatever reason have adopted a similar approach against Pittsburgh. If Washingtons intent has been to goad the Penguins into taking retaliatory penalties or adjusting their style to reflect the increase in physicality, it has failed so far.A lot of teams try to slow us down or try to be extra physical against us, and we know if we get sucked into that then were getting away from our game and were not productive that way, Crosby said. I think its pretty clear that we know if we get caught up in that, we put ourselves in a bad position.Even before Saturday, the Penguins were furious with Washington, whose professional pest, Tom Wilson, was fined  though not suspended  for delivering a knee-to-knee hit against the rookie Conor Sheary in Game 1.Wilson called it accidental, saying that their legs got tangled, and Sheary did not comment much, other than calling it a hockey play.There were plenty of appealing hockey plays in Game 2, from Matt Murrays gorgeous save of a Nicklas Backstrom one-timer to the former Capital Eric Fehrs fending off Orpik to score the winning goal with 4:28 left. But the lasting image is of a player on his knees, unable to stand, an absent look in his eyes, a head injury sustained, and needlessly at that."}
{"text": "LONDON   The hardest league title race to call in Europe right now is in Spain. A single point separates Barcelona, Atltico Madrid and Real Madrid with two games each left to play, and like the plot of a decent detective thriller, this one is going all the way to the wire.The suspense is compounded by the fact that the two Madrid teams have knife-edge semifinal second legs in the Champions League this week. And Barcelona still has the Copa del Rey final to come.Everyone should enjoy the drama, except for Vicente del Bosque, the Spanish team national coach, because every extra game, every extra effort put on heart and mind and sinew will affect the players he needs to defend the European Championship in June.The weekends La Liga games were rolled out like consecutive chapters on Saturday. Gareth Bale rose to head the winning goal in Reals 1-0 victory at Real Sociedad in the early afternoon. Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to strike Atlticos goal, also for 1-0, against Rayo Vallecano in Madrid.And then in the late evening, but still in 77-degree heat at kickoff, Barcelona wore down Real Betis in Seville before Ivan Rakitic and Luis Surez scored to make it 2-0 to Bara.If they carry on like this, Barcelona will win the title. It has the same points total as Atltico, but in Spanish soccer the first tiebreaker is the head-to-head between two teams, and Barcelona beat Atltico home and away earlier this season. Losing out to Atltico in the Champions League doesnt count.Real Madrid is that one point behind. We fought, we suffered, we worked hard until the end, Reals coach, Zinedine Zidane, said after his match. Im happy weve picked up three points. In my head, I wanted Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema in the team, but Im happy for Bale that he scored.Bales injuries seem behind him. Benzema has struggled for some time to finish games. And Ronaldo has reportedly been having stem cell treatment for a thigh muscle injury that kept him out of the Champions League semifinal first leg match against Manchester City last week.Zidane can doubtless remember his own trials and tribulations with injuries, not the least when he attempted to play in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea too soon after tearing a thigh muscle.The prizes are out there, and the athletes try to reach them, regardless of what the body is telling them.Of the three Spanish clubs competing for the league trophy, Atltico looks perhaps the freshest and the fittest at this moment. The coach, Diego Simeone, despite being banned from the field and ordered to the stands for the final three games of La Liga, called the shots.His ban follows a game against Mlaga the previous week when Simeone appeared to tell a ball boy to throw a ball onto the field to disrupt a dangerous attack against his team. He pleaded innocence, but the worldly wise Coach Simeone still took the rap of a three-game sideline ban and a $3,000 fine.Instead of whipping up the players and the crowd the way that Simeone normally does, he sat impassively high in the stands. Impassive, but not idle. From up there, he says, he can see the play more clearly.He made the call to rest seven normal starters ahead of Saturdays game against Vallecano, and he, without anyones seeing him do so, decided the time to make match-winning substitutions.In the 54th minute, Atltico brought on its two main strikers, Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Torres. Less than a minute after that, with his first touch on the ball, Griezmann scored the only goal of the game.Whatever else Simeone can be called, he is a remarkable coach. He galvanizes a work ethic in every single player, he persuades each and every one to go to his limit. And with Griezmann the improvement since he joined Atltico from Real Sociedad in 2014 has been to make him consistently the teams most reliable goal scorer.Just 40 seconds after taking the field, he struck with his first touch. It was a shot on the run, the body immaculately poised, the left foot driven through the ball from 20 yards, the result unstoppable.What was important was winning, Griezmann told reporters. We have to rest because there is a nice match on Tuesday.The nice match is in Munich, against Bayern in the Champions League.But the wins by the two Madrid teams put the heat on Barcelona in Seville. For 50 minutes, Bara toiled, and Betis defended stubbornly on a bone-dry field that the players said inhibited their flow.There was a lack of pace, of movement, of invention  even from Lionel Messi. But one Betis defender in particular effectively handed the points to Barcelona.Heiko Westermann is an imposing, experienced German central defender. Only he can explain his rush of blood when he clattered into Rakitic and Messi with such obvious fouls that earned two yellow cards within seven minutes, and he was sent off before halftime.Barcelona, with Messi pulling the strings from midfield, took full advantage. An angled cross by Messi let to the first goal by Rakitic after the other central defender Germn Pezzella and the goalkeeper Antonio Adn got in one anothers way going for the same ball.Then, the coup de grce: Messi rolled an inch-perfect through pass for Surez to score his 55th goal in 52 games of the season, leaving Barcelona, Atltico and Real in that order atop La Liga."}
{"text": "It is always a joy when, as at the concert of Juilliard415 at Alice Tully Hall on Friday evening, a composer who has long been just a shadowy name to you takes up vivid musical residence in your consciousness. And there is good reason that Georg Muffat, a French-born German composer of Scottish ancestry, was already a name.We owe much of our information about both the French and the Italian orchestra to this very cosmopolitan musician, Robert Mealy, the director of the Juilliard Schools historical performance department writes in program notes. Muffat, he points out, was present at the creation of the orchestra in the 17th century, working with Lully in France and with Corelli in Italy.To judge from Muffats two works here, sonatas from his Armonico Tributo, he absorbed both styles thoroughly and unified them deftly. The long, luxurious Passacaglia from a Sonata in G, which ended the program, was especially impressive: one of those remarkable Baroque inventions over repeating bass lines that seem as though they could spin on forever, and that you want to do so.The attractive program, strenuously conducted from a harpsichord by the Danish early-music specialist Lars Ulrik Mortensen, also offered three concerti grossi by Corelli (with a movement repeated later as an encore) and a sonata by Biber from his Fidicinium Sacro-Profanum (Sacred and Profane String Music). Mr. Mortensen imparted tremendous energy to the young string and, at times, woodwind players, providing occasional keyboard flourishes but leaving most of the continuo work to players on a second harpsichord and a positive organ.The distinction between sonata and concerto was by no means firm at this point in history, as soloists, often in a small group (concertino), began to separate themselves from the main body of instruments. Here, with as many as 29 young players onstage, the various solo stints in the strings were divided among numerous individuals, showing, as so often, a remarkable depth of artistry from students in the Juilliard historical performance program, established a mere seven years ago."}

{"text": "Earlier this year, when the state government of Alabama passed a law to nullify a Birmingham ordinance to raise the citys minimum wage, the racist overtones of the action were jarring. An all-white majority of the state legislature joined forces with the states white governor to deny the stated will of a majority-black city.Birmingham has struck back. A federal civil rights lawsuit filed last week by the Alabama NAACP and other plaintiffs asserts that the nullification bill was motivated by racism and, as such, violates the Equal Protection clause of the United States Constitution. It seeks a declaration from the court to that effect and a judgment to allow the Birmingham ordinance to become city law.The lawsuit bases its assertion of racism on two main points. One, in overturning the Birmingham law, the legislature relied upon authority granted to it under provisions of the states regressive 1901 constitution, which ushered in the era of Jim Crow. The lawsuit argues that in exercising that tainted authority, Alabamas lawmakers were, by definition, exhibiting the same discriminatory intent as the constitutions framers.The lawsuit also argues that racial intent is apparent in the timing, speed and impact of the state legislation. It was rushed through the legislature just as the Birmingham city council was preparing to expedite the local ordinance. Over 70 percent of the 40,000 people who would have benefited from the higher city minimum were African American.Alabamahas no minimum wage of its own, adhering instead to the abysmally low federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. The residents of Birmingham called for a minimum wage of $10.10 an hour by mid-2017.In a colorblind world, Montgomery would have followed where Birmingham was leading. In the real, racist world, Montgomery snarled and attacked. Now the law must be used to force it to back off."}
{"text": "John Beltran found his muse in a graffiti-covered New York City that was broke, dirty and dangerous. He used to tag along as his father, a numbers runner and loan shark, made his rounds in El Barrio and the South Bronx in the 1970s. The streets were a revelation to him, a child who spent his days drawing pictures from the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Suddenly, what he saw in books couldnt compete with what he found on walls.Decades later, Mr. Beltran  now known as SinXero  is a mixed-media artist, painting abstract works whose textures reflect the crumbling buildings of his childhood and whose colors draw upon the rich palette of aerosol art. Picasso had Guernica, I had the Bronx, Mr. Beltran, 46, said. What happened in Guernica affected Picasso and he painted that. Why cant the socioeconomic situation I grew up in  the economic collapse of the Bronx  be part of what surfaces in my painting?That realization has fueled not only his personal work but also his determination to convert drab walls on commercial strips and side streets into alfresco galleries. Over the last three years he has enlisted street artists from New York and beyond to brighten the urban landscape. Last week, the graffiti artist Chris Ellis, who is known as Daze, painted a wall on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx that was made famous by the artists Seen and Duster in the 1983 graffiti documentary Style Wars.To Mr. Beltran, this urge to create is not so different from what he saw as a child, when young graffiti artists had few outlets apart from walls and subway trains. He didnt go to museums growing up. And even though he attended the High School of Art and Design, his stay was short-lived because of frequent fights and the threat of the Decepticons, a  fearsome gang that preyed on teenagers in the 1980s.After some detours, he went on to college, studying literature and learning photography and graphic design. He had a roster of clients for his design work, as well as a full-time job as a medical office supervisor on Park Avenue in Manhattan. But after growing tired of helping other people achieve their dreams, he decided about two years ago to become a full-time artist after being laid off from an office job.With the support of his wife, Myra, he turned the garage behind their Bronx home into a studio, where he paints canvases that are sold in two Manhattan galleries. He is serious and earnest about his artistic goals, especially when it comes to wanting to transform dreary spaces using large-scale murals made under the auspices of TAG Public Arts Project, a nonprofit he founded to encourage street art.The murals he has sponsored adorn Westchester Avenue and feature artists like Damien Mitchell, Marthalicia Mattarita and Luis Zimad Lamboy, among others. The pieces can be colorful and playful, often combining different media. Several landlords along the strip have embraced the project, saying the murals not only liven up the stretch under the elevated train tracks but also deter vandals from scrawling their tags.They really are amazing, said Robert Bieder, the owner of a plumbing supply business who has recommended Mr. Beltran to other landlords. Weve seen people from all over the world coming to admire this work. I had no idea there was such a great following for this kind of artwork.Mr. Beltrans next goal is a second-story alcove above Mr. Bieders shop. The roof already features several pieces, including one by Mr. Beltran honoring Christopher Lee, a graffiti writer known as Shadow, who died in 2013 and was an early supporter of his work. The pieces occupy a prime spot: easily visible from the elevated trains that rumble past.While his list of walls is growing, he is stumped why some landlords wont entertain his ideas, yet continue to allow their walls to be covered with random tags that reappear almost as soon as they are painted over.How long have these businesses been making money in our community? Mr. Beltran asked, pointing to one building along Bruckner Boulevard whose owner, he said, refuses to allow a mural. Every day they make money off our community, and theyre not even maintaining their property. We are offering a free service and a couple of artists to make it look good.Mr. Beltran emphasizes that he is not a graffiti-removal service, even if his murals keep vandals at bay. If anything, he said, he understands the need that some young people feel to find a creative outlet if no other opportunity is offered. That is why he feels a sense of gratitude when he sees young people coming by to watch him and other artists paint their murals.You never know, he said. Its like the same way I imagined myself to be an artist, how art was the one constant in my life. How do we not know that some kid looks at a mural being painted today and says he wants to be an artist and starts painting and drawing? He could be tomorrows next big thing. You never know when you are going to inspire someone."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Some will watch Hell or High Water at the Cannes Film Festival in mid-May and see diversity. Gil Birmingham, one of its stars, is a Native American, of Comanche ancestry.Others will notice political currency. A contemporary Western set in Texas (and shot in New Mexico), the film finds brothers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster settling scores with a bank, and perhaps the 1 percent, over a mothers reverse mortgage gone wrong.But cineastes may spot something else.That might be  depending on your critical sense, and tolerance for West Texas humor  one of the top diner or deli scenes in movie memory, right up there with the chicken salad sandwich order in Five Easy Pieces and Meg Ryans faked orgasm at a deli in When Harry Met Sally.The scene stealer in Hell or High Water is a waitress played by Margaret Bowman, who is 88 and appears to be just a little more grizzled than Jeff Bridges. For the record, Mr. Bridges is pretty grizzled as a Texas Ranger, near retirement, trying to get a bite in the world famous T-Bone Cafe, set in Coleman, Tex.Howdy, maam. How are you today? Mr. Bridges opens, innocently enough.Hot. And I dont mean the good kind, Ms. Bowman says, getting down to business. So, what dont you want?To say more would get deep into spoiler territory. Suffice it to say, Mr. Bridgess character gets off easier than a guy from New York who once walked into the T-Bone and tried to order fish.Previously titled Comancheria, Hell or High Water is based on a script by Taylor Sheridan. Mr. Sheridan also wrote Sicario, a story of the border drug wars, and had a recurring role as Deputy Chief David Hale in the television series Sons of Anarchy.CBS Films is expected to release Hell or High Water in partnership with Lionsgate in late summer, but has not yet set a date.A bit unexpectedly, the movie is directed by David Mackenzie, a Scottish filmmaker who first gained notice with the 2003 film Young Adam, a drama set in working-class Glasgow, with Ewan McGregor, Tilda Swinton and Emily Mortimer in its cast.The movie has a lot of themes that are running in the American election, really: guns, oil, banks, Mr. Mackenzie said, speaking last week from his home in Glasgow.West Texas, Mr. Mackenzie said, first captivated him during a stay with a friend in Alpine. As for Ms. Bowman, a Texas native who began acting when she was 60 and had a small part in No Country for Old Men, Mr. Mackenzie said he knew what he should do as soon as his casting staff had her read for the part.My job as a director was to put it in the right place, and let it run, he said."}

{"text": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo has strengthened the state office that investigates misconduct by prison guards, and also proposed legislation that would make it easier to dismiss corrections officers who commit crimes on the job.These are good first steps toward rooting out the culture of violence that has long dominated the prison system. The next task is to renegotiate a recently expired union contract that has shielded brutal or unqualified guards from accountability in any number of ways.As The Times and the Marshall Project reported jointly in April, the correction departments internal affairs unit  which is responsible for investigating misconduct  has historically been weak and ineffective, partly because it relied too heavily on career corrections officers who lacked investigative experience and were also wary of offending fellow officers.The Cuomo administration has professionalized the staff, bringing in people who have worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. As a result, the unit seems ready to do a better job and has shown a greater willingness to refer cases for criminal prosecution. This does not address the reluctance of district attorneys in places where prisons dominate the local economy to bring charges against their prison guard neighbors. But its an improvement over the status quo.The governor has also proposed giving the corrections commissioner the power to fire workers who commit misdemeanor crimes, instead of sending them into a convoluted arbitration system that inevitably allows guards to keep their jobs.That will require changing the flawed union contract. The current disciplinary system does not give the commissioner final say in dismissing officers who have committed even serious offenses. That power is instead held by arbitrators who are chosen jointly the state and the union  and who try to find a middle ground so as not to fall out of favor with either side.The state needs to negotiate a new disciplinary process like the one for the State Police Department, where charges against troopers are heard by three commissioned officers, two appointed by the State Police superintendent and one by the union. The panels decisions are subject to final approval by the superintendent.A particularly troublesome  provision  in the contract allows guards under investigation to simply refuse to answer questions from the police. The state must also extricate itself from a senselessly rigid seniority system embedded in the contract that gives corrections officers their choice of jobs and bars managers from moving them out of positions in which they can do harm.Until these weaknesses are remedied, there will be little accountability and the prison brutality problem will not be solved."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Thank you for your editorial about Illinois and Kansas as examples of states where policy makers do more harm than good (Sorry Tales From Two Statehouses, April 25).Illinois record 10-month budget impasse is eroding much of its educational and social service systems.

At least 3,200 homebound seniors have lost home-delivered hot meals.Service agencies have laid off experienced and talented staff members, perhaps never to get them back. Lutheran Social Services of Illinois, the states largest social service provider, announced that it would cut 43 percent of its work force.And all 29 Illinois agencies serving sexual assault survivors have instituted furloughs or left unfilled positions vacant, leaving survivors without essential services.The damage is permanent, not easily or perhaps ever remedied.

{"text": "As in any national election without an incumbent president, the candidates are painting a not-so-pretty picture of America: The country is going to hell, bluntly asserts the Republican front-runner Donald J. Trump.The Democratic challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, isnt much kinder and even Hillary Clinton is starting to focus more on challenges than successes.To many voters, the message is: The economy is terrible, the social fabric is disintegrating and America is losing respect around the world.Certainly, problems abound. The recovery from the 2008-9 recession has been uneven and is characterized by widening income inequality; wages for the average working family have stagnated for decades. Racial tensions in some places have worsened, suicide rates are up, terrorism is on the rise, Russia and China are threatening and the political system is dysfunctional.But that is hardly the whole or even the dominant story. Politics aside, there is more good news than bad.For all the inequities, no Western economy has recovered from the recession as well as the United States. The unemployment rate has been cut in half, with 14 million jobs added over the past six years.Most other indexes are encouraging: Consumer confidence has risen and the housing market has basically recovered. Budget deficits have plummeted, there is less reliance on foreign oil than any time in almost three decades, and the health care overhaul has had more positive consequences than negative ones.Still, wages are only starting to creep up. While the federal government is frozen, more than one-third of states have increased their minimum wage.Wages should be a focus of the presidential campaign, though vows such as breaking up the banks or slapping big tariffs on Chinese imports are distractions.There is progress on cultural and social fronts, too. Bitter divides remain, but Americans have become more tolerant. Although some politicians still pander to racial prejudices, young people are more open.The same is true of sexual orientation. Ten years ago, same-sex marriage was an explosive issue; today, there is wide and growing acceptance.There are encouraging developments on issues emphasized by conservatives.There are only about half as many abortions as 30 years ago. Teenage pregnancies have plummeted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that the birthrate among American teenagers had fallen to a historic low. This continues a quarter-century of improvement; especially important to experts is that the sharpest drops have been among Hispanic and black teenagers.And there is good news on crime. Both the murder rate and overall violent crime rate have been cut almost in half since the 1980s. Theres bipartisan consensus to try to do something about the outrageously high incarceration levels, particularly for blacks. There is a chance that even this Congress might pass measures.The world is a dangerous place, but its not as threatening to the United States as it was 10 years ago when two wars raged. There is slow progress in the fight against the Islamic State, though future terrorist acts are inevitable and the danger will remain for years.Critics claim that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has consistently outmaneuvered President Obama. Yet Russia is more isolated today and subject to economic sanctions. And Mr. Putins Syrian involvement could become a quagmire. China is more important and has been more aggressive in Asia, but its internal political and economic problems dwarf those of the United States.To be sure, many of the problems articulated in the campaign are real. The next president faces a host of economic, national security and social challenges.But pessimists still should answer two questions: If the goal is to make America great again, what era should we aspire to return to? And is there any country whose hand you would rather have?"}

{"text": "A high-ranking official in the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department resigned on Sunday after it was revealed that he had shared a series of racist and sexist jokes from his work email account in a previous job with the Burbank Police Department.Sheriff Jim McDonnell of Los Angeles County said in a statement that the official, Tom Angel, his chief of staff, had resigned on Sunday. His resignation came days after The Los Angeles Times first reported on the emails, which the newspaper said were obtained under the states open records act.This incident is one that I find deeply troubling, Chief McDonnell said. Despite the Sheriffs Departments many recent efforts to fortify public trust and enhance internal and external accountability and transparency, this incident reminds us that we and other law enforcement agencies still have work to do.Last Wednesday, The Times published 15 pages of email correspondence that contained jokes about Muslims, Catholics, Latinos, African-Americans and women.In one email, Mr. Angel asked a colleague, How many virgins do Muslims get in heaven?In another, he forwarded a joke about a student who had done poorly on a biology exam. I was asked to name two things commonly found in cells. Apparently blacks and Mexicans were not the correct answers.The emails sent by Mr. Angel also criticized political correctness and supported the racial profiling of Muslims. They were sent between 2012 and 2013, when he was the No. 2 police official in Burbank, Calif.Chief McDonnell said on Sunday that the department would review its training curriculum and hold meetings with community groups to brainstorm ways to improve its understanding and appreciation of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of the area it serves. He also said the department would begin conducting random checks of its employees email accounts.We are only as effective as the relationships, credibility and trust we have with our community, he said."}
{"text": "As the prosecutions witnesses testify in a gang-assault case against nine Rikers Island correction officers, a band of their colleagues keeps watch in the Bronx County Hall of Justice, where the case is being tried.Jurors have heard from a doctor who treated the inmate, Jahmal Lightfoot; investigators who looked into the use of force against him; a prisoner who said he heard Mr. Lightfoot groaning during the July 2012 attack that left him with orbital bone fractures; and Mr. Lightfoot himself.The nine current and former officers are on trial in the beating of Mr. Lightfoot and an attempted cover-up at New York Citys jail complex. The most serious charge is attempted gang assault in the first degree, which carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Other charges include attempted assault, tampering with physical evidence, falsifying business records and official misconduct.Along with the jury, up to three dozen current or retired correction officers and union representatives have been reviewing the evidence and scrutinizing, sometimes audibly, each ruling made by the judge, Steven Barrett.The officers go to State Supreme Court to support the defendants, but they may also see their own fates hanging in the balance of what Justice Barrett described as a simple, almost one-fact case that could rest on whether Mr. Lightfoot had a weapon, or whether officers thought he did.One former officer, Victor Rodman, regularly sits in the back row of the courtroom. He is trying to raise money to appeal a conviction of his own. Mr. Rodman was sentenced in January to 90 days in jail for punching an inmate who then lost the sight in one eye.Its similar, he said of the current trial.Since colleagues helped him get through his ordeal, Mr. Rodman said, he wanted to show his solidarity.He and others following the case share a widespread belief among officers that their profession has been targeted by the city and unfairly demonized by the public.Despite the staunch support from some, Patrick Ferraiuolo, president of the Correction Captains Association, said he was disappointed by the small number that turned out in support from the defendants ranks.He noted the seven officers, a chief and the two captains  including one who is being tried separately  who have been charged. And you dont have a packed courthouse? Mr. Ferraiuolo said. Most people who come to sit and watch, he said, are retired. And that is a sin and Im not going to sugarcoat that.Even though the unions sent reminders to members to attend to show support, Mr. Ferraiuolo said some officers were unaware of the trial, including some who work on Rikers Island.Of those who have shown up, some have expressed skepticism that the officers would be treated fairly.Mr. Rodman, who is already upset with the court over his conviction, said the judge was derided in some circles as A.D.A. Barrett, as in assistant district attorney, for his tendency to side with the prosecution.Justice Barrett seems firm, with a sense of humor, about order in the courtroom. At one point, he admonished defense lawyers for theatrics before the jury and at another time instructed supporters in the courtroom to try not to make any outbursts or grunts with the jury present. The judge also chastised a prosecutor for arriving late.During the trial, events unfolding outside the courtroom have crept in.Since the trial began in March, news has surfaced of a corruption inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Norman Seabrook, the head of the union that represents the citys correction officers, who was in the courtroom for the first day of testimony.Mr. Ferraiuolo was called away from the trial last month when a correction officer was arrested in the assault of a prisoner inside a holding cell at the courthouse. Mr. Ferraiuolo had just detailed in an interview six cases of urine being thrown at other correction officers in one week in March  the same provocation the officer said caused him to beat an inmate with his radio.As news of assault charges against that officer broke, Judge Barrett, at the request of defense lawyers, instructed jurors to ignore news media reports of cases similar to the one before the court.For a group of officers already feeling scrutinized, even their camaraderie can seem like a liability.Defense lawyers have called for mistrials, once recently because of the prosecutions handling of Sandy Arkhurst, an officer who was in the area working overtime when the beating took place but who says he heard nothing.Pishoy Yacoub, an assistant district attorney, asked questions about his relationship with each defendant, eliciting responses about officers having each others backs 100 percent.Even on the stand, right? Mr. Yacoub asked."}

{"text": "MEXICO CITY  Four men have been arrested in the murder of a Honduran environmental and indigenous rights activist whose killing two months ago prompted international condemnation, the authorities said on Monday.The activist, Berta Cceres, led a decade-long fight to block construction of the Agua Zarca Dam along the Gualcarque River, which is sacred to her Lenca people. Despite numerous threats and the killings of other members of her organization, she was undeterred.She was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize last year, but the international acclaim was not enough to protect her. On March 3, gunmen burst into the house where she was staying in La Esperanza, her hometown, in western Honduras, and fatally shot her.The suspects were arrested in raids early Monday. Two of them are linked to the Honduran company that is building the dam, Desarrollos Energticos S.A., or DESA.Since the killing, the Honduran government has been under intense pressure to find Ms. Cceress killers. The murder occurred as President Juan Orlando Hernndez has been trying to project a new image of his country, one of the most violent in the world.Alongside the gang and drug violence, a steady drumbeat of assassinations of journalists, lawyers, labor and peasant leaders and environmental activists has come to mark Honduran politics ever since a 2009 coup.One of the suspects arrested on Monday, Sergio Rodrguez Orellana, is a manager for social and environmental issues for DESA, the company said in a statement, noting that it was surprised by his arrest. We trust that all employees actions are within the law, the company said, and denied any material or intellectual connection to the murder.The company said it had complied with all investigators requests.A second suspect, Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, had worked in the past for a security company hired by the dam project, DESA wrote in response to an email.A military spokesman told the local news media that the two other suspects are an army major and a retired captain.Ms. Cceress family said they learned of the arrests from news reports. They questioned whether the investigation would ultimately lead to those who planned and ordered the killing. Ms. Cceres was not under police protection when she was killed.Because we have been excluded from the investigative process from the start, we have no way to judge whether the arrests are the result of an exhaustive investigation, nor do we know if they included the intellectual authorship at all its levels, according to a statement Monday from Ms. Cceress family and the organization she founded, the National Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras.Silvio Carrillo, a nephew of Ms. Cceres, wrote in an email that officials had told the family last week to expect an arrest soon.The family asked for an independent investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, but the Honduran government rejected it.As we have stated since the assassination, Mr. Carrillo wrote, the Honduran government lacks the veracity and political will to conduct a just, thorough and professional investigation."}

{"text": "BURLINGAME, Calif.  This is the most populous state in the nation, but in presidential elections, it has almost always found itself on the sidelines. The last time a Republican primary in California mattered was 52 years ago, when the party nominated Barry Goldwater.But California will finally play an important role in the drama of presidential politics.The 172 Republican delegates up for grabs in the states June 7 primary, which in most years has taken place well after the partys presidential standard-bearer was known, will determine whether Donald J. Trump can clinch the nomination on the last day of voting and avoid having to wrangle uncommitted delegates at the national convention in July.All three Republican presidential candidates, along with hundreds of reporters, turned up for the partys state convention here over the weekend, the biggest show in memory of presidential candidate firepower at this yearly gathering.California is at a crossroads  California is going to decide this Republican primary, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who may need a win in Indiana on Tuesday to keep his hopes alive here, told hundreds of conventiongoers Saturday. Whod have thunk it?The sudden interest in California, on one hand, has been a cause for celebration in a state that has been starved for attention in presidential contests. A meaningful primary means extensive campaigning, and a national focus on issues of particular concern to the electorate here, rather than the usual brief touchdowns to raise money or appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live!Mr. Cruz, for one, drew appreciative applause when he denounced environmental regulations that he said were depriving drought-stricken farmers of water in the Central Valley. A rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, all but gushed: Im not a big panderer, but I do have to tell you, I love California. I have been coming here for a very long time.As desirable as the attention may be, the prospect of the presidential campaigns arrival in California also poses a threat to the states Republican Party, which has been politically marginalized, with Republican registration at just 28 percent. A Republican has not won a statewide election since Arnold Schwarzenegger was re-elected governor in 2006.Republican leaders are in the midst of a major effort to reposition the party ideologically as it seeks to revive its appeal in a state that is increasingly Democratic and Latino. In large part, that means distancing the state party from national Republicans on issues like immigration and same-sex marriage.Yet Mr. Trump landed on Thursday night in Orange County with a blistering speech attacking immigrants who are in the country illegally and suggesting that Mexicans illegally crossing the border were responsible for a recent spike in crime in Los Angeles. And Mr. Cruz trumpeted the endorsement of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who championed a state initiative in 1994 that would have cut benefits to those in the country illegally and that is widely seen as one of the reasons the party is struggling today.Even if Mr. Trump wins in Indiana and convincingly proclaims himself the presumptive nominee, he is almost certain to continue campaigning aggressively in California to amass enough delegates to fend off any challenges at the Republican National Convention.That is a prospect some Republicans here do not welcome.It does set back Republican efforts in California, said Bill Whalen, a fellow with the conservative Hoover Institution who served as a senior adviser to Mr. Wilson. The California party is in a phase of rebuilding and rebranding. And that means toning down the message and developing a message that appeals to a widening swath of Californians. I cant think of a more toxic situation than him coming in alienating women and Mexicans.Chuck Page, a Republican State Senate candidate from Saratoga, said he was worried about how the presidential campaign here might affect Republicans like him. It makes it harder for me, he said in the atrium of the convention hotel here, protests against Mr. Trump clearly audible outside. Im a middle-of-the-road kind of guy.There was a time when it seemed the fight between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would also remain up in the air until June, providing California Democrats with their own rare opportunity to help decide a national primary. But with Mr. Sanderss chances of overtaking Mrs. Clinton fading, the biggest question here may be whether he will make a strong enough showing to provide her one more embarrassment as the primary calendar runs out.In general elections, Californias 55 electoral votes are the biggest prize on the map. But the state has swung decisively Democratic in recent years: A Republican has not carried the state since George Bush beat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.Californias presidential primary is most often scheduled to coincide with the June state primary  largely to avoid the cost of separate elections. By that point, though, presidential nominations have usually been decided. And when the presidential primary has been held earlier  as in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton defeated Barack Obama in the state  California has had to compete for attention with other states holding contests the same day.We were pretty relevant in 68, said John Burton, the state Democratic chairman, who has been involved in state politics for 50 years. He paused. Yeah, thats a long time ago.Understandably, the prospect of another relevant campaign here has stirred much excitement. When Mr. Kasich, who has won just one state this year, showed up on Friday for an evening news conference, 15 television cameras awaited him. The convention hotels atrium was packed with volunteers passing out buttons for Mr. Cruz or trying to sign up delegates for Mr. Kasich. (Strikingly, no such organizational presence was visible for Mr. Trump.)Ive never seen anything like this this far out, said Jim Brulte, the state Republican chairman, who was besieged by delegates, campaign aides and reporters as he moved through the convention hall.The convention site, as it happened, was 10 miles from the Cow Palace, the scene of the bitterly divided Republican National Convention that picked Mr. Goldwater in 1964.The party is reaping a windfall from the heightened interest: Tickets to hear Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kasich speak were $100 each. Yet there was a cost, too, in the protests outside, and in a three-story banner smuggled into the hotel and unfurled down a wall, reading, Stop Hate.A greater cost, some Republicans fear, could come in setting back efforts to reposition the party on immigration and to appeal to political independents in a state where Latinos make up 39 percent of the population. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, by contrast, are appealing to core Republican primary voters who, polls show, embrace their tough immigration language.Its devastating to us here, said Rob Stutzman, who was deputy chief of staff to Mr. Schwarzenegger and is leading the anti-Trump movement in California. Its so toxic to our brand.And Marty Wilson, a Republican strategist, said the damage extended beyond Latino voters. It hurts us even more with Asian voters, he said. Our growth in California comes because of immigrants from the Pacific.Lanhee J. Chen, a California Republican who advised Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign, warned that a discussion that is as caustic and bitter about immigration as Trump wants is problematic for the long-term prospects of the party. He said that prospects for state candidates in 2016 were nearly impossible already, and that even 2018 would be tough.Its hard to get good candidates, he added, to do kamikaze missions."}

Apple has fallen eight days in a row, and has lost 16 percent of its value in the last two weeks.Technology stocks have been an unexpected drag on the market. Last week, Apple reported its first quarterly decline in profits in years, which sent ripples through the stock market. In response, investors have been moving into safer investments. The Dow Jones utility index, a collection of 15 dividend-paying utility companies, is up more than 14 percent this year.Theres a risk-off sentiment in the market right now, said David Lebovitz, a global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.Overseas, Japans Nikkei stock index fell more than 3 percent overnight as markets there reopened after a holiday. The market fell as Japanese investors continued to react negatively to the Bank of Japans decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The Japanese yen also continues to climb sharply, which hurts Japanese exporters.Its a bit concerning. Mr. Lebovitz said. Investors are beginning to question whether monetary policy can really push Japans economy forward and generate growth.Among individual companies, Halliburton rose after a $34 billion merger with Baker Hughes was called off in the face of antitrust concerns from the Justice Department. Halliburton rose 74 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $42.05. Baker Hughes fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.40.The Apollo Education Group, which runs the University of Phoenix, rose sharply after a group of investors raised its bid for the company. Apollo rose 97 cents, or 12.4 percent, to $8.77.In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said on Monday that its manufacturing index came in at 50.8 last month, down from a 51.8 reading for March but above the 50 threshold that signals growth. The March number ended a five-month losing streak for manufacturers.Export orders grew faster in April, but new orders and production grew more slowly last month than in March. A measure of employment fell, suggesting that factories are cutting workers.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 0.3 percent in March after a 1 percent gain in February. The consecutive increases raised total spending to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.14 trillion, the highest level since October 2007.The increase in February represented an upward revision by the government from its initial estimate that spending had fallen 0.5 percent for the month. But the government revised the estimate for January down to show a drop of 0.3 percent, from a previously reported increase of 2.1 percent.The report showed that the housing market remained robust through the first quarter of the year, said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays Research.Benchmark American crude oil fell $1.14 to close at $44.78 a barrel in New York.

{"text": "KATHMANDU, Nepal  The embryos belonged somewhere, but probably not in this empty fertility clinic in the capital of Nepal.For months, they had sat suspended in a tank of liquid nitrogen at the fertility center at the Grande City Clinic and Hospital, which until recently operated a robust surrogacy business that attracted would-be parents from around the world. But the embryos are now stuck in limbo after Nepal abruptly banned surrogacy in September.Weve gotten to the point now where its shut down and we dont know where to go, said Kain Rafferty, a data services officer from Melbourne, Australia, who has embryos stored in the clinic.Surrogacy may be the only way for some couples to have biological children by implanting an embryo into a woman who carries the child for them. But many cannot afford the process in developed countries like the United States or Canada and have looked for cheaper options in less-regulated countries like Nepal, India and Thailand. Now, one by one, these nations have shut their doors amid concerns over exploitation of the surrogates, oversight and safety, leaving people of less means without many choices.When you look at the global map currently, said Doron Mamet, a co-chief executive officer of Tammuz, a surrogacy agency based in Israel, there are only a few options that are open.The United States regulates surrogacy on a state-by-state basis, and some states are friendlier than others. Californias laws are among the most permissive, while surrogacy contracts are unenforceable in states like Michigan.The process is allowed in a patchwork of other countries, to varying degrees. Canada, like many places, forbids commercial surrogacy, meaning that pregnant women may be reimbursed only for their expenses. Ukraine is one of the few low-cost surrogacy options available to foreigners, but not to same-sex couples like Mr. Rafferty and his partner, who used an egg donor to create their embryos.Israel bans same-sex couples from using a surrogate, and many heterosexual couples consider the process too onerous and expensive. Some couples, like Oshri and Anat Gez, have looked outside the country for easier and less costly options.The Gezes said they came to Nepal after a decade of trying to have a child and four failed attempts with surrogates in India.They had wanted two children, and were expecting twins through a surrogate in Kathmandu when Nepal imposed its ban. Their leftover embryos would have been expensive to store, especially in a country where they could no longer be used, Mr. Gez said.But the twins were born prematurely, the Gezes said, and one did not survive. The Gezes brought home only one child.But by then the couple had already decided to destroy the leftover embryos. Now, the couple must figure out where they can start the process again.We didnt know, Mr. Gez said. We thought we had twins.Mr. Rafferty, the Australian, and his partner are also evaluating their options, and what to do with their embryos. Like many same-sex couples, they turned to Nepal after India closed surrogacy to single people and gay couples. India later shut off surrogacy to all foreigners, and there is a debate over what to do with some of the embryos stored there, too. Complicating matters further, frozen embryos can be more difficult to use successfully than fresh embryos.India and Nepal share a porous border, and some women who wanted to become surrogates crossed easily into Nepal, where there were fewer restrictions, according to several surrogacy experts. That, critics said, was part of the problem.The process of gestational surrogacy has been criticized for taking advantage of vulnerable women with few financial resources. Prabin Pandak, a legal advocate who petitioned the Supreme Court to ban surrogacy, argued that it was akin to human trafficking.The chance of exploitation is very high, said Deepak Dahal, a Nepali journalist who covered the surrogacy debate for the Nagarik News.The Internet is littered with ads for surrogacy agencies, some more respected than others. In Nepal, agents typically acted as go-betweens for prospective parents and the clinics on the ground.The problem with those agencies  some of them of course are probably very good and careful  but anybody can do it, said Lisa C. Ikemoto, a law professor at University of California, Davis, who specializes in reproductive technology. Basically what they do is they set up a website.Surrogates in Nepal often came from poor rural areas of India, and they had few protections if the agency refused to pay them or if they got sick or injured. Critics of surrogacy also worried that agencies and prospective parents had no obligation to take care of ill or disabled babies.But proponents say that surrogates can earn life-changing sums of money. Its true that they do this for the money, said Dr. Sahil Gupta, who has overseen surrogacy at the Grande clinic. Dr. Gupta, who is now based in India and is working remotely with Mr. Rafferty, said that he typically arranged for surrogates to earn about $9,000 each, plus room and board.The thing is, the kind of money that they get out of surrogacy is probably 10 years of their savings otherwise, Dr. Gupta said, adding that he is hopeful that the government will reverse its position.A small handful of pregnant women were allowed to carry their children to term after the ban took effect. One surrogate at the clinic, a shy woman who for privacy reasons wanted to give only her first name, Bibha, said that she earned just a few hundred dollars a year as a seamstress in India. Speaking through a translator who works at the clinic, Bibha said she hoped the Nepalese government would change its mind.Before the ban, Dr. Gupta estimated that roughly 40 to 60 percent of his clients had been same-sex couples. Some went to Mexico, he said, where there was a brief window before banning surrogacy for foreigners, too.For same-sex couples, its become increasingly difficult, said Andrew Vorzimer, a lawyer who specializes in reproductive law.Experts also worry that newer, unregulated surrogacy industries will experience the same swift crackdowns of their predecessors. I am very much in favor of less expensive options for people, but to date there has not been a single place Ive felt comfortable sending people to, said John Weltman, the president and founder of Circle Surrogacy, which is based in Boston, Mass. I would caution dramatically against new and up-and-coming places like Cambodia, and Panama, because the legal framework is not secure."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Chinese Communist Party officials have put an outspoken property tycoon who is a party member on a one-year probation for writing online comments criticizing President Xi Jinpings propaganda policies, according to reports published on Monday by Chinese news websites.The probation means the tycoon, Ren Zhiqiang, could be expelled from the party, which has more than 85 million members, if he steps out of line again. The news was announced on a public holiday by party discipline officials in the Xicheng district of Beijing, a sign that the party wanted to get the news out quietly, perhaps because of Mr. Rens popular online presence.Mr. Ren wrote comments on his microblog in February questioning a major announcement that month by Mr. Xi that Chinese news organizations must serve the party. Mr. Ren wrote on his main microblog, which had nearly 38 million followers, that the Chinese news media should serve the people and not the party.Mr. Ren had a reputation for posting contentious statements, which earned him the nickname the Cannon. Censors quickly deleted his posts on Mr. Xis new policy, and a website managed by the Beijing party committees propaganda bureau said Mr. Ren had lost his party spirit and taken up opposing the party.Then officials at the Cyberspace Administration of China, which controls Internet content, decided to muzzle him by deleting his main microblog account, which had been hosted on the Sina Weibo platform.The Internet control agency took the unusual step of issuing a long statement explaining its move. A spokesman, Jiang Jun, said in a written statement issued on Feb. 28 that Internet users have reported that Ren Zhiqiangs account had been continuously publishing illegal information, and the impact was vile.The censure of Mr. Ren came as a surprise to his friends and online followers, and some liberal Chinese rushed to his defense. Zhang Xin, another prominent real estate developer, posted news of the deletion of Mr. Rens Sina Weibo account the day it happened. Some Chinese scholars, journalists and party insiders wrote commentary criticizing the censure.The public pushback gave a window into the growing frustration among intellectuals over the broad crackdown by Mr. Xi on freedom of speech.Many Chinese businesspeople such as Mr. Ren see party membership as useful, in part because of the access it allows to officials and the party elite.Mr. Ren did not answer calls made on Monday evening to his cellphone.Some political analysts also noted that Mr. Ren was a friend of Wang Qishan  the powerful head of the partys anticorruption agency and an ally of Mr. Xi, who has made the fight against corruption in the party a touchstone policy.The analysts said there had been signs for months that there may be tensions or a power struggle underway in the top party ranks between Mr. Wang and Liu Yunshan, the overseer of the vast propaganda apparatus. Both men are on the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the top governing body in China. The analysts said the attack by censors and the Internet agency on Mr. Ren might have been a swipe by Mr. Liu and his allies at Mr. Wang.Elite party politics in China continues to be opaque under Mr. Xi, and there is often speculation of where the major players stand and who wields greater power and influence."}
{"text": "Jacques Brand, the chief executive of Deutsche Banks operations in North America, will leave the German bank, one of the highest-ranking executives to do so during the firms overhaul.Deutsche Bank will announce Mr. Brands successor in due course, said John Cryan and Jrgen Fitschen, the co-chief executives of Deutsche Bank, in a note posted on the companys website on Monday.Mr. Brand is headed to PJT Partners, said two people briefed on his plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that part of the announcement is not public.His departure comes at a crucial time in the banks evolving relationship with United States bank regulators. The Federal Reserve requires that large foreign banks soon place their United States operations into new holding companies that will then be subject to stricter regulation than foreign banks had been subject to in the past.Mr. Brand was to become chairman of Deutsche Banks new United States holding company. The bank announced internally in March that Bill Woodley, who is currently the deputy chief executive of Deutsche Bank in North America, will serve as chief executive of the new holding company.The stakes are high for Deutsche Bank in this transition because its American operations have fallen well short of the Feds expectations in recent years. Last year, for instance, one of Deutsche Banks American entities failed the Feds annual tests that are meant to assess whether a bank has the wherewithal to make it through stressful economic and market conditions.Mr. Brand began working at Bankers Trust about 26 years ago and moved to Deutsche Bank when it bought Bankers Trust in 1999. He rose through the ranks to become chief executive of North America. The region he oversaw included about 10,000 employees. As a deal maker, he is known for his real estate expertise, notably for helping advise Blackstone in its $26 billion acquisition of Hilton Hotels.Deutsche Bank has advised Marriott International on its acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, and last year it advised Blackstone on its purchase of Strategic Hotels & Resorts.Last year, the firm ranked eighth in advising on global mergers and acquisitions and 11th in advising on mergers in the United States, according to rankings provided by Thomson Reuters.Mr. Brand is the latest banker to leave a large firm in favor of a newer and smaller shop focused on mergers and acquisitions. Paul J. Taubman, a former investment banker at Morgan Stanley, left in late 2012 to start his own firm, which soon merged with a unit of Blackstone.Last year, that entity, which is now known as PJT, offered stock through an initial public offering. Since then, the firm has advised on key deals, including Yahoo, which is considering selling itself."}
{"text": "PHILADELPHIA  Seeking to do more than provide basic homes for its residents, this citys public housing agency is taking a new approach to neighborhood revitalization. In its latest project, it is adding commercial and educational development to its main role of home building, aiming to address the underlying causes of urban distress.In the northern part of the city, the Philadelphia Housing Authority is razing part of the Norman Blumberg Apartments in the Sharswood neighborhood, which has had especially high rates of poverty, crime and urban blight. The agency plans to bring in shops, offices and schools, along with housing, in an ambitious program to breathe new life into a struggling community.The $500 million project, just two and a half miles from downtown Philadelphia, aims to recreate a middle-class community that never recovered after being ravaged by rioting in the 1960s, agency officials say.Two high-rise apartment buildings from the late 1960s that had become symbols of urban decay were imploded in mid-March in the most conspicuous stage so far of the project. Other dilapidated housing has also been removed.Under the multiyear Sharswood Blumberg Choice Neighborhoods Transformation Plan, commercial development and new or reopened public schools, as well as fresh housing, will offer the neighborhood its best chance of recovery, said Kelvin A. Jeremiah, president of the Philadelphia Housing Authority.We never really came up with a comprehensive approach that went beyond housing, Mr. Jeremiah said. If you only focus on housing, what about the crime issues? What about amenities? What about the education?Under the plan, the destroyed towers, as well as some other low-rise apartment buildings on the eight-acre site, will be replaced by 1,200 new housing units. Most will be for rent or sale at below-market prices. The first phase of the new construction, containing 57 units, is underway and is due for completion this fall.Central to the new vision will be the creation of a new commercial corridor along Ridge Avenue, the neighborhoods main street, which lost businesses as the local economy declined.In all, the plan projects 400,000 square feet of commercial space. The agency said it was close to making a deal for a drugstore and a supermarket. It is also seeking agreements with other businesses like banks, Mr. Jeremiah said.The housing authority plans to move its headquarters to the street from downtown, bringing around 1,100 employees, who will bolster demand for businesses.Mr. Jeremiah said the agency was in talks with some private developers who were attracted to the project because of its proximity to adjoining neighborhoods like Brewerytown to the west and Francisville to the southeast. In those neighborhoods, new construction is popping up and property prices are rising as a real estate boom ripples outward from downtown, or Center City, Philadelphia, with residents seeking more affordable options.The Michaels Development Company, a developer of affordable housing, plans to build 42 affordable rental units in Sharswood. The companys senior vice president, Milton R. Pratt Jr., said the neighborhood was well positioned to turn itself around given the buoyant market nearby and its proximity to Center City.This is one of the most attractive neighborhoods in the city for redevelopment, Mr. Pratt said.Similar efforts to involve private developers in public housing projects have taken place in Chicago. Molly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Housing Authority, said the agency had redeveloped several neighborhoods by combining public and market-rate housing with commercial development.The New York City Housing Authority offers commercial space at market rates to businesses like dry cleaners, delis, supermarkets and barbershops.Philadelphia officials say that citys revitalization plan also depends on providing public schools to replace two that shut down in 2013. The housing authority is working with the school district and Big Picture Learning, an educational nonprofit, to decide whether to reopen the shuttered schools or build anew, said Nichole Tillman, a spokeswoman for the housing agency.The project has attracted support from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which awarded it a $500,000 planning grant under its Choice Neighborhoods program. Jane Vincent, an administrator for the federal agency, said the grant reflected the projects potential and federal, state and local involvement.It really is transforming the neighborhood, she said.While other Philadelphia neighborhoods are plagued by poverty and crime, the problems are especially acute in Sharswood, Mr. Jeremiah said.Youre looking at a neighborhood that is severely distressed, he said, noting that the poverty rate in the predominantly black Sharswood community is 53 percent, or twice the rate for Philadelphia as a whole.Mr. Jeremiah said that during an evening trip to the neighborhood in 2013, soon after he became head of the housing agency, he encountered a man who threatened him with a gun when he refused to buy drugs. After hearing residents stories of crime in the area, he thought the housing authority ought to focus on the neighborhood.We have to do better by these families, he said.About 500 families were temporarily relocated to low-income housing elsewhere in the city while the project takes shape.To create space for the new housing, the agency has been buying property from residents, but it has met resistance from some who say it has offered prices far below market value. In some cases, the agency has used eminent domain to acquire parcels.Michael Scott, a resident of Sharswood since 1969, said the agency offered him around $60,000 for a house, a commercial building and a vacant lot that he said together were worth about $300,000. He rejected the offer.Sitting on a wooden fence bordering one of the neighborhoods 1,300 vacant lots, Mr. Scott, 49, said he welcomed the revival plan because its time for the neighborhood, but he is waiting for a higher offer for his property.A neighbor, Kim Wong, 69, said the housing authority offered him $28,000 for his house, one of only three still standing on his block. He said the property was worth $105,000.Ms. Tillman said that the housing agency was committed to giving residents fair prices for their properties and that owners were entitled to a reappraisal at the agencys expense if they were dissatisfied with an offer.David Scolnic, a real estate lawyer with the Philadelphia firm Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, said the redevelopment plan had great potential to improve one of Philadelphias poorest neighborhoods. But its success, he added, hinges on whether new businesses can be persuaded to open there.The key to the whole development is how quickly can you get people back into the neighborhood, and that will give the retailers a chance to succeed if there are sufficient residents there, Mr. Scolnic said. If it works, it could be a model for similar developments nationwide."}
{"text": "Person of Interest has no superheroes, no zombies, no ninjas, no direwolves. But as much as any show on television, it makes the high-low connection thats at the heart of genre and comic-book storytelling.The obvious appeal of this CBS series, which returns for an abbreviated fifth and final season on Tuesday, is pulpy and visceral. Its central cast includes three wisecracking assassins with good looks and hearts of gold, and the spiraling, frantic story lines allow them and their adversaries to run up prodigious body counts. (Secondary characters on Person of Interest almost always come with expiration dates.)But the shows premise, combining fear of sentient computers with fear of unfettered post-9/11 government surveillance, has been sufficiently sturdy and coherent to provide ballast for the comic-book action. It makes you think, or think youre thinking, while you enjoy the gunplay and slightly dopey humor, and it makes you care more than you expect to about the fates of the shows heroic, heavily outnumbered band of hackers, black-ops agents and cops.In the new season the series pushes that conceptual framework hard. Finch (Michael Emerson), the owlish genius who created the crime-predicting artificial intelligence program called the Machine, wonders whether its time to pull the plug: Is the existence of a program that could exterminate us an existential risk the world cant afford? (Two programs, actually, given that the Machines main antagonist since Season 3 has been another artificial intelligence, named Samaritan.) The answer, as fans of Finch will immediately predict, lies in the Machines close connection to its benevolent maker.At the end of Season 4 (a full year ago), the writers killed off or sidelined most of the adversaries of Finchs group, leaving the corporate-backed Samaritan and its shadowy minders as the only significant enemy. In the early going of Season 5 (four episodes were available to critics) the show spins its wheels a little.One of the clever things the shows creator, Jonathan Nolan, did was to encapsulate the creative tension between self-contained, crime-solving episodes (a CBS hallmark) and a long-range conspiracy story by having the Machine spit out numbers that led the heroes to individual, weekly cases. With 13 episodes to go, the producers appear to be leery both of spending time on cases and of setting up their climactic showdown too soon, and the plots have a neither-here-nor-there quality. In the fourth week, however, the reintroduction of some favorite characters begins to bring the story into focus.The most crucial element of the shows success remains the same: Mr. Emersons tremendously appealing, oddly moving performance as Finch, the programming genius who is uncomfortable in every situation but always rises to the occasion. As the new season opens Mr. Emerson has to play a number of very emotional scenes with a computer monitor, carrying on passionate conversations with the blinking cursor. Not one moment of this will tempt you to laugh (in fact, you might have to blink back a tear), and thats a bit of magic as impressive as any string of computer code."}
{"text": "Pep Guardiola arrived at Bayern Munich in 2013. Bayern, the German league champion, had just won the Champions League under its departing German coach Jupp Heynckes, and Guardiola  a Spaniard who had just directed Barcelona through a four-year period in which trophies seemed to pile up like snowflakes in a blizzard  was expected to produce the same continental glory.To date, he has not. And if Tuesdays second leg of this years Champions League semifinal does not produce a trip to the final for Guardiola, he will leave for Manchester City this summer having been beaten at the penultimate stage in all three of his seasons, and each time by a former Spanish rival.An ouster this year would perhaps be the most intriguing. Although Bayerns losses to Real Madrid (2014) and Barcelona (2015) were against sexier opponents, the man on the opposing bench on Tuesday has quickly become one of Europes defining characters. In an era when teams so rarely have a distinctive identity that carries over from season to season, Diego Simeones Atltico Madrid, which holds a 1-0 lead against Bayern Munich after the first leg, is European soccers pink elephant: big, stout and impossible to miss.This is by design. While Guardiola made Barcelona world famous for its silky, possession-oriented style, Simeone has transformed his red-and-white-striped Atltico players into rugged, ruthless defenders who guard their penalty area with fury and look to strike on offense through counterattacks or, quite often, on set plays after restarts.The style has worked particularly well in Europe. Since Simeone took over Atltico in 2011, the Rojiblancos, as the team is known, have conceded Champions League goals at home to only three teams and have lost at Vicente Caldern Stadium just once. This season, Atltico has produced 34 shutouts in 53 games in all competitions, including last weeks first-leg stifling of Guardiolas star-laden team.The Atltico wall has several critical pieces. Among the most important, of course, is the goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, who was a backup until an injury to the starter forced him onto the field last spring. Oblak, a Slovene, responded immediately, saving a penalty and recording a shutout in his first match. He has kept hold of the starting job since.In front of Oblak are a number of hard-nosed players like Filipe Lus, the Spanish national team starter Juanfran and Jos Mara Gimnez, a talented young center back. The captain is Diego Godn, a gritty veteran player whom Simeone praises constantly and trusts implicitly.Godn is typically all over the field, pushing his way into scrums and serving as a backbone to Atlticos unflagging shape. Yet even he did not hesitate, when asked earlier this season, to identify the root of Atlticos success.Simeone is the stone around which this project is constructed, Godn said. He has strengthened this group of players. He has made the players and fans believe, not just with words but with acts.Many of those acts involve Simeones sideline histrionics, which are notably piqued and pugnacious. An Argentine who played in three World Cups for his national team as a midfielder, Simeone cuts a swarthy figure in the bench area, typically wearing outfits that are mostly (or entirely) black and slicking back his flowing hair. With his square jaw and sharp glare, Simeone is imposing when he confronts a referee or stamps his foot or takes off running in celebration after an important goal, particularly in comparison with rival coaches like Barcelonas Luis Enrique, Manchester Citys professorial Manuel Pellegrini or even Guardiola.After retiring from a playing career that included two stints at Atltico, Simeone began his managing career by bouncing around clubs in Argentina. In 2011, he helped the Sicilian club Catania avoid relegation, briefly returned to a job in Buenos Aires and then, in December of that year, joined Atltico.There, Simeone found his place, injecting the club  which has historically played in the significant shadow of Real Madrid  with a needed distinctiveness and a belief that Spanish soccer could be about more than Barcelona and Real. In his first season, Simeone won the second-tier Europa League. The next year, Atltico beat Chelsea to claim the season-opening Super Cup, and in 2013 Simeone won the Copa del Rey, with Atltico beating Real Madrid in the final.Then, in 2014, he delivered the Spanish league title and was a minute away from beating Real Madrid in the Champions League final before losing in extra time.Now, Atltico is back on the verge of another trip to the final. A rematch with Real and its new coach, Zinedine Zidane, is possible if Los Blancos are able to overcome Manchester City on Wednesday, though beating Bayern Munich is challenge enough on its own, and Guardiola will have the added incentive of trying to avoid a personal triad of Spanish dismissals.Its not over yet; we still have a chance, Guardiola told reporters recently. If we lose it, you can kill me. But we still have a chance.Simeone, understandably, was circumspect regarding Atlticos focus. Playing at Munichs Allianz Arena is among the most difficult road games in Europe, yet neither the circumstances, nor the opposing players (even if they include weapons like Thomas Mller or Robert Lewandowski), change Simeones expectations.He expects his players to be brutish. To be firm. To be unbowed.It is what they always are. It is what he has made them."}
{"text": "A doctor who performs abortions at a hospital in Washington filed a federal civil rights complaint on Monday, charging that the hospital had violated the law by forbidding her, out of concerns for security, to speak publicly in defense of abortion and its role in health care.The doctor, Diane J. Horvath-Cosper, 37, an obstetrician and gynecologist, has in recent years emerged as a public advocate, urging abortion providers not to shrink before threats. Last December, her complaint says, officials of the MedStar Washington Hospital Center  imposed what she described as a gag order, but what the officials termed a sensible precaution against anti-abortion violence.At odds in the case are sharply conflicting visions of how best to protect abortion providers and patients. The dispute comes at a time when legal restrictions on the procedure are tightening, many clinics are besieged daily by hostile protesters and an extremist fringe has sometimes made murderous attacks.Dr. Horvath-Cosper is part of a national movement of physicians and other medical staff members who argue that silence about their work only feeds the drive to stigmatize and restrict abortion. Similar sentiments among some patients have led to a Shout Your Abortion campaign on social media.The dialogue is dominated by those who have demonized this totally normal part of health care, Dr. Horvath-Cosper said in an interview.I dont think the way to deal with bullies is to cower and pull back, she said.Still, some hospitals and clinics providing abortion services, and many physicians, especially in more conservative and rural regions, think it is safer to try to keep a low profile.Abortion care is so highly stigmatized that providers have felt safer staying in the closet, and many institutions have also wanted their doctors to stay in the closet, said Dr. Nancy L. Stanwood, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Yale School of Medicine.Each individual has to decide how he or she feels, said Dr. Stanwood, who is the chairwoman of Physicians for Reproductive Health, a national advocacy group that includes more than 3,000 doctors and provides media training to those who want to speak out on medical issues. That is a personal decision based on privacy and risk.According to the legal complaint, hospital officials told Dr. Horvath-Cosper that they were worried about security after a self-described anti-abortion warrior attacked a Planned Parenthood center in Colorado Springs in November, killing three people and wounding nine.In ordering Dr. Horvath-Cosper to end her advocacy, the medical director of the hospital, Dr. Gregory J. Argyros, said he did not want to put a Kmart blue-light special on the fact that we provide abortions at MedStar, according to the complaint.Since then, hospital officials have ordered Dr. Horvath-Cosper to turn down several requests for interviews or articles or risk losing her job, she said in the complaint, which was filed with the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services.If the civil rights office finds that Dr. Horvath-Cospers rights were violated, it can order the hospital to take corrective action or risk losing its federal funding.The hospital on Monday afternoon did not directly respond to the allegations, saying in a brief, emailed statement, MedStar Washington Hospital Center is committed to providing family planning services for our community, and we do so in a respectful, private and safe environment.We look forward to cooperating fully with the Office for Civil Rights, said the statement, which was issued by Donna L. Arbogast, the hospitals vice president for public affairs and marketing.Dr. Horvath-Cospers legal case rests on a little-known aspect of the Church Amendment, which was adopted in 1973 after Roe v. Wade established abortion rights nationwide earlier that year. The bill is best known for offering protections to medical staff members who object to participating in abortions on religious or moral grounds.But the legislative history and final wording of the amendment show it was intended to be two-sided, said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Womens Law Center and a co-counsel in Dr. Horvath-Cospers complaint.The law states that no entity receiving federal money may discriminate against any doctor because of his religious beliefs or moral convictions respecting sterilization procedures or abortions. That means that doctors are protected from punishment for supporting abortion, just as they are protected if they oppose it and refuse to participate, according to the complaint.If she cant speak out about abortion the way other doctors at the hospital do about what they work on, she is being treated differently and that is discrimination, Ms. Borchelt said.Dr. Horvath-Cosper finished her medical residency in obstetrics and gynecology in Minnesota in 2010, and eventually decided, she said, that she wanted to focus on abortion and contraception, and to train more doctors in this subspecialty.There will always be someone to do C-sections at 3 in the morning, she said. But there might not always be someone to perform abortions.She came to MedStar in 2014 on a two-year Family Planning Fellowship, which is offered by a national foundation that subsidizes doctors salaries at selected hospitals as they pursue advanced training in reproductive medicine, including the development of teaching and speaking skills.Dr. Horvath-Cosper created a buzz last November when she wrote an article in The Washington Post that described what it was like to live in fear because of her profession.The Colorado shootings occurred on Nov. 27. On Dec. 4, she was called to meet with Dr. Argyros and other hospital officials who said she should stop her public advocacy and clear any media requests with the public affairs office.Since then, Dr. Horvath-Cosper said, she has forwarded several requests to be interviewed or write articles and in each case has been turned down.Her lawyer, Debra S. Katz, of the Washington firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, who is also co-counsel in the complaint, said she tried to negotiate an agreement with the hospital that would allow Dr. Horvath-Cosper to write about abortion without mentioning where she worked.Hospital officials responded that if she wished to speak about abortion, she should relinquish her fellowship and leave.Dr. Horvath-Cosper said that the MedStar center in Washington, while seeking to silence her, had not carried out many of the physical security measures at the clinic that are recommended by professional groups like the National Abortion Federation."}
{"text": "ISTANBUL  In Libya in 2011, an American-led coalition helped to topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafis 42-year dictatorship. Unfortunately, the coalitions lack of engagement with the countrys transition allowed a political void to form that a number of groups have since then fought to fill.The ensuing mess has made parts of Libya a hotbed for militants inspired by the Islamic State. This in turn has worsened the countrys security crisis, as opposing groups have claimed the right to govern under a banner of secularism.The truth is that Libyas struggle is not between Islamists and secularists. This tedious framework for interpreting Arab politics hides the complexity of Libyas situation. Almost all of the major competing factions in Libya include some number of Islamists, liberals and militia supporters.The real division in the country is between those who want Libya to move forward via the newly installed unity government, and those like the strongman Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who took control of a large part of the east after the fall of Colonel Qaddafi and is loath to give up his one-man rule of his fief, based in the coastal city of Tobruk.The process toward a unity government has been slow and difficult. It wasnt until December that a United Nations-backed effort finally came to fruition with the signing of the Libyan Political Agreement, the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in the capital, Tripoli, Tobruk and elsewhere. The new governments officials finally entered Tripoli only a few weeks ago.Despite the full backing of the United Nations Security Council, this Government of National Accord still has enemies. Some opponents want to thwart the new administrations aspirations for a democratic and prosperous post-revolutionary Libya by returning the country to Qaddafi-style rule. Others simply fear that a unity government will undermine their own standing and authority.The holdouts include leaders like General Hifter, who wants control of the Ministry of Defense, and Nouri Abusahmain, the president of the General National Congress (an interim parliamentary body whose term came to a formal end in 2014 but which has lived on contending its legitimacy), who wants to undo and renegotiate the new political agreement. These opponents usually explain their stance as a response to what they see as unfair behavior by their political adversaries in the unity government.Their goal, though, is not to promote any particular ideology, but to protect the power they grabbed in Libyas post-revolutionary chaos. Theyre mainly worried that the Government of National Accord, in which no faction holds a majority, cant be controlled in a way that would advance their personal agendas.While General Hifters camp justifies its military actions by warning of an Islamist takeover, Mr. Abusahmains loyalists have tried to portray the unity government as a Western plot that, if allowed to govern, will give up Libyas sovereignty and forget about the revolutions original aims. To move forward, Libyans must ignore these reactionary voices.Members of these groups often represent themselves variously as either liberals, moderate Islamists or nationalist-inclined democrats. They speak of working for fair government, but many have accumulated considerable personal power and wealth by exploiting the recent turmoil. Some of the so-called liberals who like to sound the alarm about Islamist influence have aligned themselves with warlords like General Hifter. Apparently, they wouldnt mind riding to political power on the back of a tank, crushing constitutional democracy along the way. A primary purpose of the unity government is to check these factionalists.Libyas ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Aref Ali Nayed, who is affiliated with the House of Representatives in Tobruk, a body backed by General Hifter, has emerged as a leading voice of those who, making no distinction, portray all Islamists as terrorists. Lumping together organizations as far apart politically as the Muslim Brotherhood and jihadist groups aligned with the Islamic State, he accuses them of tyrannizing the Libyan people under the guise of the United Nations-backed national unity administration.He also says that these belligerents tried to legitimize themselves by resurrecting the General National Congress, after it was supposed to give way to an elected House of Representatives two years ago. What Mr. Nayed and others neglect to mention is that in 2014 Libyas Supreme Court ruled that a constitutional amendment passed by the Congress before the election of the House of Representatives was invalid. This meant that the process by which the House of Representatives was formed was null and the new Parliament had to be dissolved.Amid these disputes, Libyas political sectarianism became ever more entrenched. Contrary to Mr. Nayeds claim of tyrannical Islamist rule, many Libyan leaders, including the president of the Justice and Construction Party, a leading Islamist political party (of which I am a member), have worked hard to reduce tensions and make way for negotiations.The formation of the unity government is a great accomplishment, but the road to democratic order is still uphill, particularly when it comes to ending factional violence. General Hifter, in particular, uses the army formed by the House of Representatives as a power base to compete with his political rivals in Tripoli. As Martin Kobler, who leads the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, has pointed out, that force does not represent all of Libya. To give the new government a monopoly on the use of force, all militias, regardless of ideological background, must lay down their arms; the army must be united under a single command structure.The international community understands that Libya cant be allowed to dissolve into a failed state, which is why the United Nations has thrown its weight behind the Government of National Accords presidential council. The real battle for Libya is between those who prefer to re-establish authoritarian rule and those who want to build a peaceful democracy."}
{"text": "On Monday night, Sarah Jessica Parker attended the Met Gala, celebrating the exhibition Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology, wearing a suit by Monse. Here, she explains the decision behind the unusual choice  and, with the help of her stylist Erin Walsh, shows how it all came together behind the scenes.The creative process of landing on an idea of what to wear to the Met Gala happened much later than usual this year because Ive been so consumed with shooting and postproduction. My team takes the theme so seriously each year  and I dont think wed do it any other way. Theres my amazing tailor, Lars Nord, who has been building my Met outfits for like 100 years; Serge Normant, the genius behind my hair; my makeup artist Leslie Lopez; the manicurist Gina Eppolito; the magnificent Alyssa Arminio (C.O.O. of my brands SJP Collection and SJP Beauty); and my talented stylist, Erin Walsh, who has an eye for keeping everything cohesive.Together we are always excited, challenged and befuddled by the themes  and its fun to see it all come together. There are always surprises that occur day-of; things we didnt plan that reveal themselves to us and help move things in a new but exciting direction. Things always change last minute: Serge can do my hair and then decide 40 minutes before I walk out the door that he wants to change it all. Its all part of a process.We had approached Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim of Monse with a general direction of what I was looking for  but our actual idea arrived rather late in the game. This years theme, Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology, is far more challenging than themes of years past, mostly in terms of how I wanted to express it as I understood it. It wasnt as straightforward as past themes, like the era of punk in fashion or examining Chinese culture in fashion. What is technology? And what does it mean when applied to fashion? We didnt want to simply apply lights and actual, physical technology on me. We didnt want it to be about the electronic screen or something that could turn on and off. We wanted it to be about the technology of thought, of application, of fabrication. The technology of the hand and the machine.So we decided that this year, maybe I wouldnt wear a dress; we were interested in trousers. We had been in discussions and reviewing sketches and I just so happened to take my daughters to see the show Hamilton. Ive seen it a few times now, so I can look at singular pieces of the show rather than focusing on the bigger story. I was looking at the costumes and, in particular, the mens suiting of the period. All of a sudden, I was like: Oh, thats it. It was such a specific time, and I was curious how we could use technology with that. What would the technology part of the idea be? Fernando introduced us to these embellishment artists in Brooklyn called Le Studio Anthost, who take the idea of old-fashioned couture embroidery and, with technology, apply it to fabrications using paint. It was the perfect marriage of technology and the hand of man. Together, we were able to really collaborate and meticulously look at the period and redefine what it was that we were trying to achieve.Thats when all of the important details started taking shape: the hair, the idea of doing an open back in the jacket, having the pants fold in a different way, the pinstriped sleeves, the button detailing. The one feminine thing we wanted to use was a corset rather than create a proper mens suit. Frankly, it wasnt going to be very flattering for the occasion. It wasnt going to be festive enough. It didnt feel right. The corset has very feminine framework and detailing, but in terms of overall silhouette and idea, we kept it pretty true to masculine notes without it feeling forced.We picked a very simple shoe silhouette from our collection, the Rampling, without yet knowing what color we were settling on for the suiting. We love this strong teal satin color, but it was a total leap of faith. There had been discussion of painting a stripe up the back, but when we discovered Le Studio Anthost, the idea of them applying their technology really completed the idea for us. Shoes of that period typically had buckles worn in the front  a detail we found inspiring and interesting. So I looked around in my closet and I found two brooches Ive had for 15 or 20 years: The mismatch of them seemed perfect in scale and color on the front of the shoes.I feel very fortunate to work with such a dedicated and loyal team for the Met Gala every year. We all function together like a single organism. It may just be me on the carpet, but theres a whole system of people working together behind the scenes, like the gears of a machine."}
{"text": "Financial disclosure statements from a former senior aide and campaign manager to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, currently at the center of an investigation involving improper lobbying and conflicts of interest, show that he earned at least $70,000 in consulting fees in 2014 from two entities that do business with the state.The aide, Joseph Percoco, was one of Mr. Cuomos closest confidants and was employed by him as his executive deputy secretary until early January, when he left for a job as senior vice president at Madison Square Garden.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are currently looking at whether Mr. Percoco and his wife failed to properly disclose thousands of dollars in income they had received from entities doing business with the state, according to people briefed on the matter.The states Joint Commission on Public Ethics, known as Jcope, received a federal grand jury subpoena seeking copies of Mr. Percocos financial disclosure forms more than a week ago, according to a person familiar with the subpoena. F.B.I. agents from the Buffalo office have executed search warrants at locations around Buffalo, Albany, New York City and Washington, several people briefed on the matter said.Also last week, the governors office received a grand jury subpoena seeking a broad range of records, including correspondence and other documents, reflecting whether Mr. Percoco may have sought a benefit on behalf of any of the companies that paid him and his wife, or anyone else, a person with knowledge of the subpoena said.According to records provided by Jcope, Mr. Percoco reported earning between $70,000 and $125,000 in outside income in 2014 from COR Development, a development company in central New York, and CHA Consulting, an engineering company based in Albany. Mr. Percoco received between $100,000 and $150,000 from the Cuomo campaign itself, which he managed.Mr. Percocos wife, Lisa Toscano-Percoco, is also listed on the Jcope filings as earning between $75,000 and $100,000 from Chris Pitts L.L.C., which appears to be related to a Democratic operative in Connecticut who has worked for Competitive Power Ventures, one of the entities being investigated by federal authorities. Efforts to reach Mr. Pitts by phone and email were unsuccessful.It is not clear when Mr. Percoco earned the consulting fees and if they overlapped with his time on the state payroll; he left the administration on April 20, 2014, to work on the governors successful re-election campaign, and rejoined it on Dec. 8, according to state officials.Mr. Percoco, a longtime Cuomo loyalist who has been referred to as a brother by the governor, is also believed to be one of the focuses of a review ordered by Mr. Cuomo on Friday, shortly after news of the federal inquiry surfaced. Bart M. Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, is to conduct the review; it involves the Buffalo Billion, a signature Cuomo administration program meant to revitalize that long-suffering city, and other elements of the governors nanotech initiative, on which he has hinged much of his upstate economic policy.In his first public comments since the revelation of the federal investigation, the governor offered a qualified declaration of support of Mr. Percoco, who was in his small inner circle during his first five years in office.I know Joe Percoco for many years, and he is a good man, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in remarks to reporters after speaking on Monday evening at an Association for a Better New York dinner in Manhattan. And I would be shocked if he did anything wrong.Mr. Cuomo said he had been aware that Mr. Percoco was considering taking on consulting work for other clients when he left the administration to consult for his re-election campaign. During the campaign and after Mr. Percoco formally rejoined the administration, however, Mr. Cuomo said that they never had a second conversation about which companies Mr. Percoco had consulted for, or even whether he had done so.Youre in the private sector; you can do whatever you want to do, Mr. Cuomo said. So there would be no reason to say, Well, who did you represent?COR, a major developer in Syracuse involved in several upstate nanotechnology and development projects receiving state funds, told The Post-Standard on Saturday that it had not paid any money to Mr. Percoco. On Monday, Maggie Truax, a spokeswoman for COR, repeated the statement: COR Development did not hire, retain or pay Joe Percoco in any capacity and intends to fully cooperate with any investigation into this matter.Michael McGovern, a lawyer representing CHA Consulting, which also has business with the state, said: We are cooperating fully with the U.S. attorneys office and have been responding to their requests. Based on those discussions, it is our understanding that we are not a target of the investigation.A spokesman for Mr. McGovern would not say if someone had specifically told him or his client that CHA was not a target; the spokesman also would not say if CHA had been searched, and had no comment on Mr. Percocos disclosure that he had received consulting fees from CHA.Both COR and CHA  founded as Clough, Harbour & Associates  have been significant donors to Mr. Cuomo. According to records with the State Board of Elections, Clough, Harbour & Associates contributed $195,000 to the Cuomo campaign between 2013 and 2015, including donations of $50,000 in late May 2014, about a month after Mr. Percoco began working for the campaign.COR Development is also a major contributor; its president, Steven F. Aiello, donated $65,000 to Mr. Cuomos campaigns between 2011 and early 2016, while other Aiello family members and officials also donated tens of thousands of dollars.Mr. Percocos lawyer, Barry A. Bohrer, did not respond on Monday to questions emailed to him about the payments.As a part of the governors team when he first took office in 2011, Mr. Percoco has deep connections to Mr. Cuomo, with the former aide often acting as Mr. Cuomos political enforcer and occasional de facto bodyguard. In October, Mr. Cuomos office confirmed that Mr. Percoco  who was earning $175,828 a year  would leave the administration to pursue more lucrative opportunities outside Albany.On Monday, Mr. Cuomo said that he was concerned about Mr. Percoco, whom he characterized as distraught. But he called for a full review of the facts before any judgment was made.Lets know what it was, he said. You dont know what happened. I dont know what happened."}
{"text": "Youve heard of the American dream, right? The American dream was this machine we built to get rid of uncertainty and create security. Its the white picket fence, the job and the minivan. You watch Dan Rather and a sitcom. You go to bed, go to sleep and repeat.It may not be that exciting, but hey, at least its stable. For years  for as long as we can remember  thats been the end goal: stability and security. And millions of us work really hard to get there each year.Theres nothing wrong with that if its what youre into. But theres a whole group of people  and this group is growing, by the way  who have said, Forget that. I want to focus on experiences instead.You probably know the refrains by now: Experiences trump stuff. Experiences tend to bring us happiness. More stuff tends to breed discontent. Theres a wealth of research to back up these ideas up.So people go out and spend a bunch of money to participate in adventure races like the Tough Mudder, just to have an experience. Instead of buying a new television, people buy skis and lift tickets. People pay to go to the rock climbing gym instead of paying to go to the movies. More and more, the economy is moving in this direction.But the idea that you can leave a stable job, a 401(k), sell your house, retrofit your van and spend a couple of years living out of it by yourself, or with your spouse, or even with your kids, is something completely different. Not only is it different, its mind-blowing.This mind-blowing concept is not the choice of experience over stuff. Its not even experience over stability. Its experience over security. And that is a very fascinating development in our culture.Consider the professional baseball player Daniel Norris, who was making $2 million but living in a Volkswagen van. Who told him he could do that? At its extreme, choosing experiences over stuff isnt just about making these kinds of value-based decisions about recreation on your weekends. Its also choosing experience over security and making the same decisions on a life-size scale.Once I began framing it this way, I kept learning about more and more people doing this. There is Jeremy Collins deciding to pursue a life of art and climbing after getting laid off from a comfortable office job, or the writer Brendan Leonard, leaving a copywriting job at IBM (arguably the definition of security) to follow his dreams of being a freelance writer and starting a blog.The more I learn about people completely bucking convention and living these incredibly interesting alternative existences, the more I find myself wondering, If they can do it, can I?Do I dare open that bulletproof, fireproof combination safe where Ive locked up my dreams and say, Oh, Ill do that later, when life is more stable, when Im more secure? What if I try to make this really creative vision, one that Ive always dreamed of, come true and I fail? Do I even dare to ask, What if?As for you, O.K., so you dont want to live in a van. Maybe you dont have a dream locked up inside your own little Pandoras box. Thats fine.But if you do  and my gut tells me that for most people reading this, what Im writing rings true  I am telling you to at least consider that one, simple question, What if?In considering the possibilities, consider also that according to this new set of values, the uncertainty and the insecurity that you feel trying something adventurous and new is all part of the very reason for doing it. Thats part of the tangible benefit. Thats the hard part of the adventure race, the mud in your face and the suffer-fest.As the Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard famously said, Its not an adventure until something goes wrong. Maybe youll lose some money in selling the house. Maybe youll make less income if you quit your job. But thats part of the adventure.If you would make the same experience-over-stuff choice weekend after weekend, maybe its time to start thinking about making the experience-over-security choice for your life. At the very least, you might want to ask yourself, What if?"}
{"text": "Artists Space, the venerable nonprofit gallery that was founded in SoHo in 1972 and has spent most of its peripatetic existence in that neighborhood, will close its main space there on Greene Street in June because its landlord is planning to build a penthouse atop the building.The gallery, which was founded to focus on emerging artists and has been home to several landmark exhibitions during its history, has operated out of a large loft space at 38 Greene Street since 1993 and is one of the few reminders left of SoHos storied art past. Stefan Kalmar, the executive director and curator of Artists Space, said that the institution had 29 months remaining on its lease but decided to negotiate a buyout in light of the building owners planned penthouse expansion. That project would cause construction headaches and would most likely lead to a significant increase in the rent for its exhibition space.He added that Artists Space had already begun hunting for a new location, to lease long-term or to buy, that would be large enough to accommodate its exhibition programs and also the activities of its Artists Space Books & Talks program, which it has run out of a space at 55 Walker Street in TriBeCa since 2012.Mr. Kalmar said that it was too early to say where the institution might alight, but that it was important for it to move into a neighborhood where artists currently live and work, which has not been the case for a long time in SoHo."}
{"text": "Standing in ruin on Monday near Madison Square Park was not only a hub of Serbian life in New York City.Standing in ruin was a landmark of old New York.Standing in ruin, too, was a symbol of restless Manhattan; a spiritual home for wealthy Episcopalians, the lost souls of the notorious Tenderloin and generations of Orthodox Christians, who knew it as the Cathedral of St. Sava. Peter II, the last king of Yugoslavia, attended services there.In this brownstone house of worship at 15 West 25th Street  now scorched and roofless after a fire on Sunday  Edith Newbold Jones was married in April 1885 to Edward Robbins Wharton.At the time, the building was a chapel of ease, built and run by the parish of Trinity Church on Wall Street to serve the gentry Mrs. Wharton would later write about: well-to-do society families who had deserted Lower Manhattan for the pleasant upper reaches of the city, in the East and West 20s.To provide for the return of a portion at least of our faithful and long-tried friends, it was thought expedient to build a new church at their very door, the rector of Trinity Church, the Rev. William Berrian, said at the dedication of Trinity Chapel in April 1855.Richard Upjohn was the architect of both the Wall Street mother church and the 25th Street chapel, which the Landmarks Preservation Commission called a rugged version of English Gothic Revival, reinforced with large buttresses which give it both durability and permanence.Prophetically, Trinity Chapel was the setting in 1865 for what The New York Times described as the first public celebration of the Russian (or Greek) church, not only in this city, but on the American continent.The wedding in 1885 of Pussy Jones and Teddy Wharton, as they were called by family and friends, was a quiet affair. It may have been the happiest day of the troubled marriage, which ended in divorce in 1913.It was in 1914 that Trinitys leaders decided to close the chapel, which was now surrounded by the bad elements of the Tenderloin, a shadowy realm of hotels, saloons, gambling dens and whorehouses.The Rev. Joseph Wilson Sutton was supposed to wind things down as the priest in charge. Instead, surprising everyone, he breathed new life into Trinity Chapel. Enrollment grew. A Sunday school was re-established. Spiritual healing services were introduced, as was a school for organists.By the start of World War II, however, Trinity parish could no longer afford to keep the chapel open.The property was sold in 1943 to the fledgling Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church of St. Sava, led by the Very Rev. Doushan J. Shoukletovich. A year later, it was elevated to become the first Serbian Orthodox cathedral in America.Lending instant luster to the new cathedral were King Peter II and Queen Alexandra, in exile from Yugoslavia, which abolished the monarchy in 1945.The thousands of displaced Serbians who are starving and homeless in Europe look to this king as a symbol of unity, Father Shoukletovich said at the Easter service of 1948.St. Sava suffered its first big structural trauma in 1966, when a bomb exploded at Communist Party headquarters, across West 26th Street from the north side of the cathedral. Whole sections of stained-glass were shattered by the blast. But they were later replaced with Byzantine-style windows.Resilience seems to play a large role in the history of St. Savas.Make of this what you will, but on Monday the great cross over the entrance was still standing against the sky."}

Imagine if Tesla answered the 400,000-plus pre-orders for the new Model 3 by making a few hundred. Imagine if Gordon Ramsay opened a power-lunch restaurant with only two tables.Now you know what watch lovers are up against trying to get their hands on the new Rolex Oyster Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona, scheduled to be released this year.This sleekly contemporary update of one of the most collectible watches of the last 50 years drew audible oohs when it debuted at the Baselworld watch fair in March.Reviewers declared this next-generation Daytona, with its techie Cerachrom bezel, a triumph, the watch Rolex lovers have been waiting for, in the words of Gear Patrol.Despite the $12,400 price, dealers were bombarded with orders. From the moment it was announced, demand was unlike anything weve ever seen, said Ira Melnitsky, the chief executive of Tourneau, the watch retailer.There was just one problem: Daytonas are scarce. Considered a timepiece for cognoscenti, not first-time buyers, the company typically parcels them out in limited numbers to dealers, who, in turn, set aside the few they can get for their most loyal customers.Anyone who knows how many, or few, Daytonas will actually be made is not telling. A spokeswoman for Rolex, a company that is discreet to say the least, declined to discuss production or distribution plans for the new model or even the official release date. (Many aficionados expect it in stores this summer.)Given the surging interest, the situation is starting to resemble a highly genteel version of the Cabbage Patch Kids frenzy of the 1980s, when tight supply for the must-have dolls around the holidays led to near riots in toy stores.Well never have enough to satisfy demand, Mr. Melnitsky said.Indeed, the new model may represent a prime arbitrage opportunity for anyone fortunate enough to get hold of one but crazy enough to sell it. I wouldnt be surprised to see these new Daytona models get flipped in the secondary market for a cool $5,000 premium over retail in the first six months, said Paul Altieri, who runs Bobs Watches, a prominent online dealer of vintage Rolexes in Westminster, Calif. I could sell 10 of them tomorrow.This is hardly the first time that the Rolex Daytona has created a fuss. The storied chronograph, named after the Daytona speedway in Florida, debuted in the 1960s as a tool for auto racing enthusiasts. With its three subdials for timing laps, it was basically the worlds most regal stopwatch.By the 1970s, it was already achieving icon status, with a big boost from Paul Newman, who adopted it as his signature timepiece when he developed a passion for motor sports.In the years since, the Daytona has become the rare timepiece coveted by both tweedy collectors (Christies sold a so-called Paul Newman model from 1969 for $1.1 million in 2013) and paparazzi-dodging celebrities (Daniel Craig, Adam Levine and Eric Clapton, to name a few).Anticipation of the new model has been building for years, especially after Rolex redesigned its Submariner and GMT-Master II models with Cerachrom, a scuff- and fade-resistant ceramic that infuses these venerable midcentury models with a 21st-century flair.The wait was finally over in March. My phone started vibrating nonstop at Baselworld moments after Rolex raised the green window shades, said Stephen Pulvirent, a watch journalist and editor at Surface magazine. Everybody was chirping, Its finally here.That same day, some even lined up outside the Fifth Avenue flagship of Wempe Jewelers, a prominent Rolex dealer, before it opened, said Ruediger Albers, the president of American Wempe Corporation.But for Rolex devotees, the heady rush quickly gave way to a gnawing realization that they were going to have to wait a long time to possess one. To some, it feels like an horological version of Waiting for Godot.Ive heard several times of two-year waiting lists, said Louis Westphalen, one such devotee who oversees vintage watch sales at Hodinkee, the influential New York-based watch site. I have friends who have given up because they were beyond 20th place on waiting lists.To some dealers, even two years seems optimistic. Mr. Albers said the wait could reach five years.Managing expectations is a challenge, said Mr. Albers, who is considering engraving the purchasers names on the back of each watch to discourage buyers only looking to resell for a profit. He is also considering setting aside a couple of Daytonas for loyal customers to borrow for a week, so they can at least enjoy the newness.Even so, the Daytona is likely to remain the most unattainable status symbol in town. It certainly takes less time to get great Hamilton tickets, Mr. Albers said."}

Examples include resistance to controls on tobacco, pollution, seatbelts, civil rights, access to health care, evolution and climate change.Additionally, the general perception that resistance to such changes is based on narrow financial and/or ideological interests has served to further discredit the right.Our civilization is founded on science and technology, without which nowhere near 7.5 billion human beings could possibly be living on this planet.

{"text": "Shortly after he finished college, Eric Shoemaker, a 34-year-old Los Angeles-based public relations executive, allowed his chest hair to grow out. I dont know if it was my age or becoming comfortable with myself, he said, but the thought of getting waxed  which makes your hair follicles bleed and you get ingrown hairs  you have to ask who youre doing it for.Mr. Shoemakers decision came more than a decade after those touchstone Calvin Klein ads, featuring a smooth-torsoed Mark Wahlberg (then known as Marky Mark), popularized the hairless look, which was further endorsed in the next decade by the hit TV show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.Similarly, Gabriel Santos-Rocha, a 31-year-old model manager, stopped depilating roughly eight years ago, in his early 20s. I thought that the ideal body had no hair, he said. But frustration with all the upkeep nudged him back to his natural state. I hated dealing with the maintenance and the stubble and the itching that came with it, Mr. Santos-Rocha said.The response to his furry physique has been positive. Ive never noticed anyone not liking my body hair, he said.For a new generation, the overly groomed body appears to be falling out of favor. Were seeing a return to 70s fashion, said Tim Bess, an analyst at the trend forecasting agency the Doneger Group. The late 60s and early 70s were about freedom, the hippie movement, having lots of hair.Mr. Bess cited Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac  with his unbuttoned shirts and thatch of chest hair  as a prototype, adding that the preened look seems dated. It gets a little too perfect, too mannequin-looking, Mr. Bess said.Christopher Oldstone-Moore, the author of the 2015 book Of Beards and Men and a senior lecturer at Wright State University, in Ohio, believes that an increasingly urban and digitized life has left some men disconnected from their masculinity.There are different ways to connect to your organic masculinity, Dr. Oldstone-Moore said. Hair is one way to do it.An unkempt body is a perhaps unforeseen corollary of the lumberjack look that has long since peaked in certain Brooklyn circles. Even the brand 2(x)ist, known for its sleekly textured models, has opted to show its underwear on the hairy frame of Nyle DiMarco, a recent winner of Americas Next Top Model.Tom Speight, the brands president, said, Weve seen everything from man-buns to full beards go mainstream in recent seasons, and we want to reflect that rugged, a tad unpolished, yet approachable look.As with most things, it is probably not a bad idea to be wary of extremes. I think were going to have to walk slowly, Mr. Bess said. Because if you go too far with it, it can look a little Neanderthal-y."}

{"text": "What in the World offers you glimpses of what our journalists are observing around the globe. Let us know what you think: whatintheworld@nytimes.comShes famous for a lifetime of campaigning for democracy in Myanmar, has been honored with a Nobel Peace Prize, and now, thanks to an electoral triumph, she is the leading political figure in her country.But for anyone who speaks or writes about her, she presents something of a quandary: What do you call Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for short?Western notions of first and last names dont really apply in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Burmese people generally dont hand down family names from one generation to another, or change a birth name upon marriage. And theres no particular pattern to the number of syllable elements, except that very short names like U Nu are becoming a bit less common.Burmese people use courtesy titles to convey social status, and consider them a more essential part of the name than Mr. or Ms. would be in English. Daw is one such prefix; it translates literally as aunt but means something more like madame, and denotes an older or married woman of substance. (U is the equivalent for a man.) When she was a girl, her name would have started with Ma instead of Daw.Parents can draw elements of a childs name from wherever they like, and in Daw Aung San Suu Kyis case, hers came from theirs  her father was the independence leader Gen. Aung San and her mother the diplomat Khin Kyi  as well as from her grandmothers (the Suu part, which also refers to the day of the week when she was born).Her brothers names also start with Aung San, so thats not ideal for a nickname. Instead, Burmese people tend to shorten her name using the Suu part, to Daw Suu or Amay Suu (Mother Suu) or to Dr. Suu Kyi (she has an honorary doctorate from Oxford).Thats also the route Hillary Clinton followed when she was secretary of state: In 2012, for example, Mrs. Clinton referred to her familiarly as Suu Kyi.The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, though, brooks no such familiarity: It advises that the second reference should be Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, which hardly helps in the for short quandary."}
{"text": "DAMASCUS, Syria  Adnan Gimaah was perhaps the sourest purveyor of sweets in the old souk of Damascus.If a customer questioned the quality of his wares, he snorted impatiently. If they haggled too hard, he invited them to leave. His idea of small talk was to grumble about the phone bill his wife incurred in nightly calls to their son, a homesick refugee in Germany.Costing me a fortune, he said.Still, it was impossible to miss the humor that undergirded his gruff manner, and the customers seemed to like it. It matched the mood of the city: a fatigued capital with an increasingly threadbare air, trapped in an interminable season of war.Damascus is shielded from the worst of Syrias turmoil and violence, yet filled with those who have suffered from it  the displaced, the bereaved, those seeking to flee  and so everything, even the candy, is laced with a layer of skepticism.What you do you mean, whats in it? Mr. Gimaah snapped at an elderly woman who had sat down on a couch in the back of his century-old shop and was chewing a mlabbas, a sugarcoated almond. Arent you eating it?The womans name was Najieh Dahir, and she hailed from Deir al-Zour, a besieged city in the far east of the country. In fleeing to Damascus, she had been forced to leave behind her daughter, who was trapped in a neighborhood controlled by the Islamic State and living in fear. One wrong move, and theyll cut the hand off, the mother said, matter-of-factly. Or they can take you as a slave.She had also left her husband behind, but was less bothered by that. Hes no use to me anymore, she said impatiently. He hasnt sent any money. I hope a shell lands on him.Mr. Gimaah, in apparent appreciation of the black humor, allowed himself a little smile. Mrs. Dahir ordered two kilos of mlabbas, then hurried home.A picture of Syrias president, Bashar al-Assad, was draped across a nearby lane. Mr. Assad is a ubiquitous presence in the rump state that he rules, watching from portraits in immigration halls, crowded city streets and desolate army bases. He has a variety of looks: the sharp-suited statesman, the windswept military commander in khaki and shades, or the fearless leader posing with a bear.But as the war drags into its sixth year, Mr. Assad has been joined in the images by the foreign leaders who have played a crucial role in keeping him in power: Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose warplanes have mounted devastating attacks on opposition-controlled areas, including, many believe, the bombing last week of a hospital in Aleppo that killed at least 55 civilians.Mr. Assad rules from a hilltop palace overlooking Damascus  a city that, despite continuing fighting in some rebel-held suburbs, is firmly in his grip. His early plans to modernize Syria have given way in the last five years to the iron-fisted authoritarianism of his father, Hafez al-Assad. Yet the city has managed to preserve a tenuous air of normalcy, at least in its downtown districts. Fashionable weddings spill through the streets on the weekends; the wealthy still gather for meals and to smoke water pipes at plush restaurants and bars.The opera house intermittently offers musical productions, and TV studios are filming drama series, which enjoy a huge following in the Arabic-speaking world. There are few signs of the Russians who have played such a decisive military role over the last six months.But for the most part, Syria, once a middle-income country, has only a tiny minority who can still afford the good life. Many young Syrians have fled abroad, either in search of work or to avoid military conscription. More than half the prewar population has been displaced.Some of those who remain have pawned their gold, a traditional last resort, to cover their living expenses. Everything is changing. We can feel it, said Waddah Abd Rabbo, editor in chief of Al Watan, a private newspaper. The people are tired. And the state is under such great strain, its a kind of miracle that its still going.Across the city, tattered posters from the recent parliamentary election cover the walls. Few people, however, feel comfortable speaking openly about politics, particularly with foreigners, like me  who are accompanied by an official from the ministry of information.There is little enthusiasm for the faltering peace talks in Geneva, which seem to many Syrians like an abstraction at best and an exercise in cynical maneuvering at worst. But frustration with the war-induced hardships is never far from the surface, and unlikely events can become sucked into the wars paranoid politics.After a fire swept through one corner of the old city last week, torching over 100 shops and businesses, rumors quickly circulated on the Internet that Iran, another of Mr. Assads close allies, was somehow responsible. The official explanation was more prosaic: faulty electrical wiring.The next day, Anas Kanoos picked his way through the steaming rubble of his toy store, trying to salvage what he could.Mr. Kanoos was downcast: The business, which consisted of two stores, had been in his family since his grandfather. They had already lost one store, in the Damascus suburbs, to fighting during the war.He kicked a pile of steaming childrens slippers. Then he picked up his phone and started making calls. Time to plan for a rebuilding. What else can we do? he said.Some Syrians, trying to see past their countrys anguish, are choosing to consider events in the broader sweep of history. The citys Great Mosque, a magnificent site revered as one of the holiest in Islam, once drew a stream of pilgrims. Today, that traffic has dried up, but the mosque itself remains untouched.One recent evening, flocks of warbling swallows rose and fell in unison over the mosques ancient courtyard. Inside, the caretaker, Salim al-Rifai, 85, watched over a small shrine that, according to legend, contains the head of John the Baptist.The change in Syria in the past five years was the difference between sky and earth, Mr. Rifai said, fingering his beads as he spoke. But even the worst calamities did not last forever, he added: This, too, will pass.The sound of a distant explosion filtered into the mosque. Mr. Rifai ignored it.First, though, he said, his countrymen needed to change. We need to believe in God and do what he asks of us, he said. And we need to help each other to be human again."}
{"text": "The brief takeover of the Iraqi Parliament building by supporters of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr over the weekend was rich in symbolism. On Saturday, the demonstrators penetrated the heavily guarded Green Zone, toppling cement walls that have long barricaded the countrys ruling elite from the people it is supposed to serve. They ransacked lawmakers offices, waving Iraqi flags as they demanded that the countrys political patronage networks be replaced by a new administration of technocrats. On Sunday, heeding Mr. Sadrs call, they retreated.Its impossible to predict what this remarkable show of force will lead to, given the volatility of Iraqi politics. But it made clear that Mr. Sadr  a former militia leader who has refashioned himself as an anti-corruption crusader  remains a force to be reckoned with.Depending on his next moves, Mr. Sadr could either deepen the countrys political polarization or advance Prime Minister Haider al-Abadis fledgling efforts to form a functional government. The latter possibility, admittedly very slight, is the only one that would give Iraq a fighting chance of recapturing territory from the Islamic State and confronting an economic crisis brought about by the low price of oil.Its hard not to see Mr. Sadrs return to the forefront of Iraqi politics as a threat. For much of the American occupation of Iraq, Mr. Sadr relied on violence to advance his goals. His militia, the Mahdi Army, fired rockets into the Green Zone to destabilize the American-backed government and killed scores of American troops. His fighters played a leading role in the brutal sectarian war that raged between 2005 and 2006. Mr. Sadr was equally disruptive in the political arena. His bloc in Parliament played a kingmaker role in power struggles  most notably by backing Nuri Kamal al-Malikis bid to remain prime minister in 2010. And the ministries run by his allies exemplified the cronyism he now decries.In 2014, Mr. Sadr announced that he would withdraw from politics, and he has since cast himself as a religious leader who champions the poor, regardless of sect. A year ago, he endorsed Mr. Abadis plan to reconfigure Baghdads ethnic quota-based government system by appointing competent ministers, slashing bloated payrolls and battling corruption.These changes are desperately needed. Iraq is dipping into its foreign reserves to make up for a $3 billion monthly budget shortfall. Two of the countrys main cities, Falluja, in the west, and Mosul, in the north, are controlled by Islamic State militants. Last week, Mr. Abadi, who leads the Shiite-dominated government, managed to get five  new ministers confirmed by Parliament, over the protests of several politicians who fear losing their clout if the status quo is upended. The refusal to hold new hearings for other nominees to government posts last week prompted the Green Zone protests.As he directed his followers to leave the Green Zone on Sunday, Mr. Sadr asked them to refrain from violence and to chant nationalist slogans. In a statement, he warned that his followers would call for new elections if lawmakers continued to get in the way of political reform. It is encouraging that the Sadrists have so far largely refrained from violence and that their rallies are not sectarian. If Mr. Sadr keeps it this way, the street protests might give Mr. Abadi the political cover to force Parliament to make the reforms the government needs."}
{"text": "Kenneth Bae says his North Korean captors interrogated him up to 15 hours a day for the first four weeks of his incarceration and yelled with impatience until he wrote a confession to their liking. But they would later allow Mr. Bae to read his Bible and permit him to pray.They told Mr. Bae that nobody from America cared enough to negotiate his freedom and that he would most likely spend his entire 15-year sentence of hard labor in North Koreas penal system, where he toiled on a soybean farm and lost more than 30 pounds. But they let Mr. Bae read hundreds of letters emailed from the United States by his family and friends.The North Koreans also billed Mr. Bae about $300,000 for hospital expenses as one of the conditions for leaving, but apparently dropped that demand in the final phase of his ordeal, which ended abruptly after two years in November 2014. The bill, he said, was never paid.Mr. Bae, 47, a missionary and a father of three from Washington State who was the longest-held United States prisoner of North Korea, revealed these previously unreported details about his imprisonment in a book, Not Forgotten, which goes on sale Tuesday.He was freed with another American, Matthew Todd Miller, in what the North Korean authorities described as a magnanimous gesture by their leader, Kim Jong-un. They were flown home on an American jet by James R. Clapper Jr., the Obama administrations director of national intelligence, who had visited Pyongyang to secure their release.Mr. Baes book, a chronology of events as he saw them, is written as a religious tale, sprinkled with scripture he inserted to reinforce his theme of hope versus despair and his belief that the Christian God had protected him in a country where sharing such thoughts is considered subversive. But the book is also a survival story that shines a light on North Koreas history of seizing United States citizens.About a dozen Americans have been arrested in North Korea in recent years. All but two have been released, usually through intervention by top American officials. Otto F. Warmbier, a college student from Ohio, was sentenced in March to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal a political banner. Kim Dong-chul, a businessman from Virginia, was sentenced on Friday to 10 years of hard labor for spying and other offenses.In an interview before the book was released, Mr. Bae said he knew by the third night of his detention, in November 2012, that he should start keeping a journal. I felt like I had a story to tell, so I decided that maybe it was something I could write about, he said.A naturalized American originally from South Korea, Mr. Bae was arrested in the North Korean city of Rason while leading an officially permitted tour from China, where two years earlier he had started a travel business that specialized in North Korea.His underlying motive in that business was missionary work, which is illegal in North Korea. The North Korean authorities discovered his real purpose by examining files in a computer hard drive that Mr. Bae says he had inadvertently left in his luggage.The first month of captivity, he said, was among the most difficult, as he struggled to explain why he had such material.I felt like an insect, tangled in the spider web, he said. Every time I moved it got messier, with no way out.Mr. Bae said he was questioned from 8 in the morning until 10 or 11 oclock at night, every day for four weeks. It was very intense.His treatment improved after he wrote a confession that satisfied his interrogators, in which he described himself as a terrorist who had plotted to overthrow the government. Mr. Bae said his chief prosecutor told him he was the most dangerous American criminal apprehended in the 60 years since the Korean War.While his prison cell was spartan, Mr. Bae said he was far better off than North Korean felons. The penal camp where he was assigned was apparently meant only for foreigners, even though he never saw another prisoner.It wasnt the Marriott hotel, he said in the interview. It wasnt even Motel 6.During his confinement, Mr. Bae was hospitalized three times for problems including diabetes, an enlarged heart and back pain. The North Korean authorities, he said, wanted to charge him 600 euros per night in a hospital, which he said worked out to about $300,000. I told them, Im a missionary; I dont have that kind of money, he said.While his prison treatment was harsh, Mr. Bae said it also revealed a softer undercurrent of respect toward foreign citizens by the North Korean authorities, who are concerned about their image abroad.He was never beaten, Mr. Bae said. He was allowed to communicate with family members  his mother was even permitted to see him in the hospital. He still carries the Bible he was allowed to keep during his imprisonment.What is most surprising is the access Kenneth Bae had to messages from his family, said Bill Richardson, a former diplomat who has visited North Korea to negotiate the release of imprisoned Americans, and who wrote the foreword to Mr. Baes book. Nonetheless, Mr. Richardson said in a telephone interview, Kenneths ordeal was the toughest.As Mr. Bae realized he was about to be released, he wrote in the book, a prosecutor whom he had nicknamed Mr. Disappointment for repeatedly predicting he would never leave, told Mr. Bae he had done so with good intent.I did not want you to get your hopes up only to have them crushed, Mr. Bae quoted him as saying.Mr. Bae also wrote that he had known about a trip to North Korea in January 2014 by Dennis Rodman, the former basketball player and a friend of Mr. Kims, but wrote that he only later learned that Mr. Rodman had disparaged Mr. Bae in a CNN interview, rather than calling for his release. Mr. Rodmans remarks, for which he later apologized, incited outrage by Mr. Baes relatives in the United States and indirectly galvanized publicity over his case.I thank Dennis Rodman for being a catalyst for my release, Mr. Bae said in an interview with CNN broadcast on Monday. He brought attention to my plight."}
{"text": "Second of two articles.Last week I wrote about the College Advising Corps program at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School, which helps students navigate the application process for college admission and financial aid. Advisers make a difference at schools like Gateway, where virtually all students who go to college will be the first in their families.Bukola Oloyede, now a senior at Gateway, entered it thinking she would go to a college within New Yorks city-run or state-run universities. Two weeks ago, however, she enrolled at Vassar.Oloyede had more than 20 face-to-face sessions with her Gateway college adviser, Justine Rosenthal. But she also benefited from the policies of Vassar.Most highly rated colleges say they seek qualified low-income students. But a vast majority enroll very few. At the most competitive colleges, only 17 percent of students are poor enough to receive the federal education stipends known as Pell Grants. Thats just one percentage point higher than in 2000.At Vassar, by contrast, 24 percent of the student body qualifies for Pell grants. We have a lot of luck with Vassar, said Rosenthal. Getting a bachelors degree is the best way to escape poverty. So its worth looking at what Vassar does that other schools dont.Higher education, once seen as the nations great leveler, has become a guardian of class division and privilege in America. At the countrys most selective schools, three percent of students come from families in the bottom economic quartile, while the top economic quartile supplies 72 percent. A high-achieving poor student is only one-third as likely to go to a competitive school as her wealthier counterpart.Talented students should go to the best college they can  and not just for the career advantages later. A student who could get into a top school is nearly twice as likely to graduate there than if she goes to a noncompetitive school. The top colleges are the only ones where students of all income levels graduate at the same rates. The reason is money: Selective colleges are richer. They can afford to provide specialized counseling and lots of financial aid. And running out of money is the most common reason people drop out.It doesnt seem as if closing this gap should be so difficult. Some 30,000 low-income high school seniors in America each year are top students but dont go to selective schools, or to college at all. Catharine Bond Hill, a prominent economist who studies equity in higher education, found that the share of low-income students at highly selective colleges could rise by 30 to 60 percent with no decrease in academic quality.So why dont colleges just grab these students?One big obstacle is what I wrote about last week  many students dont apply because they dont know elite schools are an option. The top students among them are also hard for recruiters to find, since they are scattered around the country.But when poorer students do apply, they are accepted less often than similar students from high-income families, or they get in but dont receive enough financial aid to go. Some elite private colleges cost $60,000 per year or more. Just thinking about graduating with a five- or even six-figure amount of debt sends many students from financially strapped families scurrying back to state schools.Colleges that enroll the highest percentage of low-income students are need-blind, which means they make admissions decisions without considering ability to pay. They offer enough financial aid to completely close the gap between the cost of college and what a students family can pay. And they actively recruit low-income students.Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst at New America, a public policy institute, said that between 20 and 25 private schools and many public colleges do all three things, among them many Ivies, Stanford and small colleges like Pomona, Wellesley and Amherst (another leader in educating low-income students).The vast majority of colleges dont. Enrolling poor students is costly, especially because each scholarship student will take the place of someone who could pay in full. The financial crisis of 2008 sliced into endowments. States are cutting public schools budgets.In addition, the money colleges do have increasingly goes to students who dont need it. Private colleges engage in bidding wars for talented wealthy students. Burd writes that the same thing is happening at public colleges, where tuition is higher for out-of-state students, and bidding wars for them gobble up a growing percentage of aid. While this crowds out low-income students, and many colleges say they would like to stop, they do not because their competitors are still doing it.Tied to money is the death grip of U.S. News & World Reports much-criticized college rankings. Colleges seek to move up in the rankings by competing on selectivity, student test scores, alumni giving and academic spending, among other metrics on which colleges do best when they stick to privileged students. The college ranking system of The Washington Monthly provides a valuable alternative. It rates colleges for their contribution to the public good, considering (in addition to graduation rates, which U.S. News also looks at) the percentage of students from low-income families, innovative research and the percentage of students who do national service.In January, the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which focuses on helping promising poor students, published True Merit, a report that details many other obstacles in the way of low-income students: Colleges give more weight to students who take Advanced Placement or International baccalaureate classes. These are often unavailable at poorly funded high schools. Students who apply for early admission often double their chance of acceptance. But early admission is not an option for students who need to see and compare all of their financial aid offers. Colleges look for interesting extracurricular activities. A student who can afford to take an unpaid internship in a research lab moves ahead of a student who spent evenings working at Burger King. Students who have a parent or close relative who attended the school get preference (a practice believed to increase alumni contributions). Harvards admission rate for these legacies, for example, is four times higher than for regular applicants. There is no more direct way to perpetuate privilege. Colleges depend heavily on SAT and ACT scores. But these standardized tests are discriminatory  the richer you are, the better youll do, even without test-preparation services and professional tutoring, to which poor kids have no access. Colleges like to see students demonstrate interest by visiting campus. Water polo scholarships. And sailing, crew and squash scholarships. Some schools dont offer athletic scholarships, but do hold places for students who play these sports. Most controversially, even affirmative action can discriminate against the poor, the report said. Nearly 90 percent of African-American students at selective colleges, some of whom were admitted through racial preferences, are middle- or upper-class.Bukola Oyolede visited Vassar for the first time in mid-April, for Focus on Vassar weekend, a three-day visit for incoming students who are first-generation or from underrepresented minorities. She was struck by the beauty of the campus  and the gender-neutral bathrooms. She felt part of the group. That, and her new mentor, who told her all about negotiating freshman year, helped calm her nerves about the extreme switch in environment that looms. It opened up a book full of friends I can communicate with, she said.Vassar was founded to serve another group that wasnt accepted at elite colleges: women. Traditionally, white, wealthy Protestant women. Vassar began admitting men in 1969. But in 2006, when Hill, the economist of higher education, became president of the college, rich and white were still very much the norm. At the time, about 11 percent of students received Pell Grants, Hill said.Since then the school has doubled its financial aid budget  which it spends only on needy students; 58 percent of students get some financial aid. Pell grant students are now 23 or 24 percent, Hill said, and the percentage of students of color has doubled. Academic standards are unchanged, and Hill said that the graduation rate of the low-income students is slightly higher than the colleges average.In 2015, the Cooke Foundation established a $1 million prize to recognize a college that supports low-income students. Vassar was the first winner.Vassar had the most decisive factor for broadening its student body: a leaders commitment. And it was fortunate that Hill began in 2006, before the financial crisis. That buy-in was easier, she said in an interview. The trade-offs didnt look quite as complicated. With the financial crisis we certainly talked about whether we could stay committed to it. The school decided to continue to be need-blind and to provide enough aid to allow every accepted student to come. To say were going to balance the budget by reducing aid to the families that were getting hit hardest by the crisis didnt seem like the right way to go, she said.Beside refocusing its financial aid on needy students, the school also expanded its recruiting. It became a partner of Questbridge, an organization that finds talented low-income students and matches them to elite colleges, and also of community organizations in several cities that do the same on the local level. And it established programs to support those students through graduation.Art Rodriguez, the dean of admission and financial aid, said Vassar has shifted its recruiting, dropping visits to some high-income secondary schools to add more poor schools. And it pools recruiting efforts with Bowdoin, Carleton, Davidson and Haverford to be able to meet more low-income students.Part of the aid for needy students came from ending merit aid, which often went to students who didnt need it. But other cutbacks were necessary. Before the crisis we had let both faculty and non-faculty staff increase, Hill told The Washington Monthly. We pulled that back, primarily by not renewing contracts, and also saved money through vacancies and retirements. That was a little harder. We had to make some changes to the curriculum, too. In the heady days before the financial collapse we would allow a class to go forward even if only two or three students registered for it. That doesnt happen any more. We also postponed on some renovating of buildings.American colleges get large government subsidies to help them provide social mobility for all. They benefit from Pell Grants and federal loans. Colleges get huge tax breaks for their nonprofit status. Some 25 to 35 percent of our revenues probably come from these privileges, Hill told the Washington Monthly. She argues that the government should be doing anything it can to encourage elite colleges to take more low-income students. It is an understatement to say that this is a minority view among college presidents.Burd has one idea. He suggests that schools at which Pell recipients constitute over 25 percent of the students be paid bonus Pell Grants.Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Cooke Foundation, believes that need-blind is the wrong approach: instead, colleges should give priority to low-income students. The True Merit report argues that it is relatively easy for a wealthy student at a prep school to get top grades and test scores. A poor student from a poor school who does so must be someone with unusual amounts of grit and tenacity. Current admissions fail to acknowledge this difference, the report says, adding that they actually punish the striver.But its hard to imagine what could make most colleges see things this way. Every incentive these days is to not get low-income students, said Burd. It takes a huge personal commitment from a leader. The only thing driving it is their conscience."}
{"text": "Once upon a time, there was a city where people looked at each other or their surroundings instead of their cellphones. Where they spoke to one another, rather than making some clever online comment. Back then, in the 1970s, Manhattan was still rough, and not just on the edges, but through and through, it seemed. And so it was a time when street photographers could roam the streets and find inspiration all around, engaging with their subjects to capture moments of subtlety, beauty and serendipity.This was the New York that Carrie Boretz discovered when she started working in 1975 as a photo intern at The Village Voice.  There was enough to be found on the street that she did not have to make a living doing still lifes or fashion. She wanted real life.I just wanted to be on the street and shoot normal people, she said. I saw things clearly. Things just bombarded my vision. It was so easy, it often didnt seem like work, to be honest.The joy of being a photographer in that era is evident in Street, a book Ms. Boretz is doing that encompasses three decades of images through the 1990s. Today, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to finance its publication. The process of rediscovering past moments  all of which she recalls  has reinvigorated her, reminding her of why she became a photographer in the first place.Her images through the decades show a photographer engaged with the city, finding unexpected moments, often with a sly sense of humor. Many of them also have something that can only be called heart, evoking in the viewer a feeling that connects them to what is happening in these carefully composed frames.I never shoot with my eye, Ms. Boretz said. Its my heart that leads. I feel too much, that heart on the sleeve thing. I tried to be an intellectual person, but that didnt fly.Ms. Boretz was born and raised on Long Island, surrounded by images from the Farm Security Administration. Her father, Alvin, was a television writer and playwright who was friends with the F.S.A. photographer Russell Lee. She still recalls how her parents would sit down with her and go through Library of Congress prints by the great F.S.A. photographers.I was mesmerized by images from the 1940s, she said. It seemed natural to want to be one, I was always comfortable with a camera. I was shy, too, and this was a way to get out there.Mr. Lee proved to be an early supporter, after she wrote to him asking for advice. About to graduate from Washington University in St. Louis, where she had worked for the student paper, she wondered if she should do something that would be of direct benefit to people, like becoming a doctor.I wanted him to write back and say, Do what your heart tells you, she recalled.   That photography could affect people in a more indirect way, and that being a photojournalist was just as important. And he did just that.With that encouragement, she set off for New York, working under Fred McDarrah at The Voice. After a few months, she was on her own, landing assignments for magazines and newspapers.At the same time, she also knew that she wanted a family. That meant she didnt want to go off to war zones or spend days on end wandering city streets. She recalled being aghast early in her career when she heard a famous female photographer talk about sacrificing having children in order to pursue her career. Ms. Boretz knew that was not for her.I wanted this normal life, she said. I didnt want to be out all night. Compared to other photographers I knew, it wasnt everything to me.In that regard, the 1990s were good to her. While she was raising her two daughters, she could drop them off at school and still have a good four hours to do day pictures for The New York Times (where her husband, Ed Keating, was a staff photographer at the time).Those were the best years of my career, she said. I had a real reverence for the people I shot. I was never harsh as a shooter. Id go to neighborhoods I had no business being in and try to blend. Then Id go back, and back and back. I was given an opportunity to shoot a slice of New York every day.She switched to photo editing after a while, working at a magazine until 2013. The year before, when her father died, something told her she should start scanning her negatives, which led to her decision to publish Street. That process helped her reconnect with the rush of being a street photographer.They are really touching, she said. Its why I became a photographer. Of course we all think were going to change the world. I just wanted to touch someone with one image.She sounds happy, with no regrets.I chose to have it all, and I think I really did, she said. My kids are fabulous. Theyre amazing. I feel complete.Follow @dgbxny and @nytimesphoto on Twitter. You can also find us on Facebook and Instagram."}
{"text": "Let no one say that India isnt doing its bit to fight global climate change: Government scientists are working hard to reduce carbon emissions by making cows less flatulent.Consider the numbers: India is home to more than 280 million cows, and 200 million more ruminant animals like sheep, goats, yaks and buffalo. According to an analysis of satellite data from the countrys space program, all those digestive tracts send 13 million tons of methane into the atmosphere every year  and pound for pound, methane traps 25 times as much heat as carbon dioxide does.So reducing animal flatulence might actually do some good  especially in India, where there is little chance of cutting back the use of fossil fuels anytime soon. (In fact, the country expects to double its coal production by 2019.)Scientists at the Cow Research Institute in Mathura, around 100 miles south of New Delhi, are tinkering with cattle feed, seeking a formula that will create less gas for the cows to belch out. (That is how most of it is released, by the way; scientists say much less comes from farting.)But a team of researchers in the southern state of Kerala is working on a long-term answer.E.M. Muhammed, a breeding expert, has been experimenting with an indigenous strain of miniature cattle that produce less milk than typical crossbred cows but are much better able to stand very hot weather. An unexpected surprise along the way, he said, was that these dwarf animals, which are about one-quarter the weight of crossbred cows, produce only one-seventh as much manure and one-tenth as much methane.In a side-by-side field trial on a blistering summer afternoon, Dr. Muhammed said, the dwarf cattle did fine while the crossbred animals were struggling to survive  one of them fainted. So he is working to isolate what he calls the thermometer genes in the miniature cows DNA, so his team can develop a large population of cattle that are heat-tolerant and planet-friendly."}
{"text": "Hulu, until now primarily a rerun service for episodes of broadcast television shows, is working to create a more robust offering that would stream entire broadcast and cable channels to consumers for a monthly fee.The still-unnamed service was described by three executives with direct knowledge of Hulus plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mike Hopkins, the chief executive of Hulu, may discuss the concept at Hulus presentation for advertisers on Wednesday.Hulu is planning to introduce the service early next year. While exact pricing details are still being determined, the new service is expected to cost about $40 a month.News of the service was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Hulu wants to offer what is known as a skinny bundle of broadcast and cable channels  in particular those operated by 21st Century Fox, the Walt Disney Company and Comcasts NBCUniversal. Those three media companies co-own Hulu.We believe the important takeaway is that this is a way for programmers to take more control of their destiny in a fragmented pay TV ecosystem with heightened risk of skinny bundle inclusion/exclusion, Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note on Monday.Two executives described the development as part of an effort to rethink the way TV companies approach streaming video to make the experience easier for viewers.The new service would not look like a regular cable channel, instead offering a more intuitive, personalized experience, one person said. It also would allow for more targeted commercials, where advertisers could select particular audiences to see their messages. An ad for cat food, for example, would be aimed at cat owners.Offering a combination of live and recorded programming to streaming services required changing traditional rights agreements, and the TV companies are expected to start making their programs available to other streaming services in a similar fashion, one executive said.Other such slimmed-down streaming television services include Sling TV, available for about $20 a month, and PlayStation Vue, which starts at about $40 a month.The services are aimed at younger consumers who prefer a more tailored streaming experience over a traditional cable or satellite subscription package and customers known as cord cutters who resist paying for bundles of hundreds of cable channels.Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a recent research note that while a new Hulu offering would allow TV companies the chance to capitalize on the push toward more tailored bundles, it also would come with a number of risks.One major risk could be that traditional cable and satellite distributors might see the new Hulu service as a declaration of war. That could put at risk the billions of dollars the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors.Mr. Juenger painted a picture of future negotiations. We expect every future distribution negotiation would start like this: Why should we carry your networks at all? If consumers want them, they can buy them directly from you? Thanks for making our decision easy  youre dropped.Another risk is that the networks left out of the new offering might join together to create their own lower-cost competitor, he said."}
{"text": "ATHENS, Ohio  Hillary Clinton typically ignores protesters who confront her on the campaign trail, but she fired back at one high-profile rabble-rouser who had stood outside her West Virginia event on Monday.I heard Mr. Blankenship was outside my event yesterday protesting me, Mrs. Clinton said on Tuesday, referring to Donald L. Blankenship, the former chairman and chief executive of the Massey Energy Company. Mr. Blankenship, one of the wealthiest men in Appalachia, was sentenced in April to a year in prison for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards after an explosion killed 29 men in 2010.Mr. Blankenship, who is set begin his sentence within months, had stood in solidarity on Monday with the anti-Clinton protesters in Williamson, W.Va., many of whom appeared to be coal workers and held signs supporting the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump. They chanted Go home, Hillary! and Bring back our jobs! as the former of secretary of state walked into a health and wellness center in Williamson, in Mingo County, an area of West Virginia particularly hard hit by the downturn in coal jobs.If Donald Trump wants the support of someone like that, he can have it, Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said at a rally here on Tuesday, pointing to legislation she supported that would put into effect additional workplace safety measures and attempt to hold executives accountable.She said Mr. Blankenship had neglected workers safety for years before the 2010 explosion at Masseys Upper Big Branch mine, which killed 29 brave men in the deadliest accident in American coal mining in four decades.Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs. Clintons West Virginia state director, Talley Sergent, said Mr. Blankenship had demonstrated blatant disregard for our miners and their safety.In a statement Tuesday, Mr. Blankenship said Mrs. Clinton should understand that as a lifetime member of coal country and a proud West Virginian, I am interestedin any suggestions she has to addressthe problems coalminers and coal communitiesface today. But, he added, it is disappointing that she is choosingto promote her political campaign by demonizing me.Mr. Blankenship, a Republican donor who rose from a working-class childhood in Appalachia to lead the nations sixth-largest coal company, continues to have deep ties in West Virginia, which holds its Democratic primary on May 10.In April, a Federal District Court sentenced Mr. Blankenship for his connection to the Upper Big Branch explosion. He was not accused of directly causing the incident and has emerged as a lightning rod in a legal case that the news media called The People v. the Coal Baron. Mr. Blankenships verdict was the first time such a high-ranking energy executive was convicted of involvement in a mining safety violation.Mrs. Clinton endured a hostile greeting when she campaigned Monday in Mingo County, a center of white working-class voters drawn to Mr. Trumps brand of populism.Her two-day bus tour of Appalachia turned into an apology tour of sorts for comments she made in March to CNN that if elected, she would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Republicans skewered Mrs. Clinton for the remark, made in the context of creating new clean energy jobs in depressed parts of the country, and she spent much of her time here explaining the remark and laying out her plan to help coal country.To put it plainly, I misspoke, Mrs. Clinton said at the final event of her two-day Appalachia tour on Tuesday. One reason I took this trip is to say it directly to the people it affected.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "A scrap between two well-known soccer players in a vital Premier League game is certain to make news. But when a manager later bizarrely raises the specter of sex masochism, interest in the incident will undoubtedly explode.While tangling during a corner kick in the first half on Sunday, defender Robert Huth of Leicester pulled on the expansive hair of Marouane Fellaini. In response, Fellaini drove an elbow into Huths neck area.The referee missed the episode, and neither player was punished, although both could still face three-match bans for violent conduct.But the incident wound up being overshadowed by Manchester United Manager Louis van Gaals memorable postgame reaction, which roamed into areas not normally discussed in sports interviews.Asked about the scrap, van Gaal told an interviewer, Manish Bhasin, of BBC Sport, When I grab your hair now, youll react also.Punctuating the remark by gesturing to pull Bhasins hair, he said, Because its not in the books that somebody has to grab with the hair and pull it behind.Only in sex masochism. Then it is allowed, he added, lifting the session into the pantheon of extraordinary interviews.Bhasin thanked van Gaal for not pulling his hair, but perhaps prudently elected not to follow up on van Gaals surprise remark.Mirth ensued in Britain over the comment.The game ended in a draw, 1-1. The result delayed Leicesters clinching of the Premier League title and also was a blow to Manchester Uniteds hopes for a top-four finish and a Champions League place. It now stands 4 points behind Manchester City for the vital fourth place with a game in hand.Van Gaal has made statements that went into strange territory before. In February, he was asked, Is that the challenge then, to match the same sort of desire the other team has?He replied: Yeah, you are right, and your word is fantastic. Desire. Hungry. And a lot of times I use the word horny to my players. After laughter from reporters, he turned to midfielder Juan Mata, to his right, and asked, Is true? Mata nodded yes, with an uncomfortable grin on his face.Van Gaal walked out of a news conference after five minutes at Christmastime last year after being deluged with questions about his job status. His unusual farewell line was, Enjoy the wine and a mince pie. Last summer, he referred to his player Chris Smalling as Mike.English is not the native language of the Dutchman van Gaal, who has also coached in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. The language gap can certainly go a long way to explain his unusual locutions. Those who mocked Pedro Martinez for saying the Yankees were his daddies often did not account for his efforts to use a modern idiom in a language not his own.There may not be many more van Gaalisms being issued from Manchester. Widespread speculation is that he will be fired after two seasons, probably to be replaced by Jos Mourinho, the former two-time Chelsea manager.Still, van Gaal remains defiant. After Sundays game, Leicester Manager Claudio Ranieri told van Gaal in a friendly way that he was doing a fantastic job. Van Gaal replied, I am."}
{"text": "As longtime readers know, a prime focus on Dot Earth has been testing ways to clarify disputes over consequential science  a need thats amplified in complex arenas laden by persistent uncertainty. Its not quite a law of physics yet, but a theres a consistent pattern in such cases in which a paucity of evidence leads to an overabundance of assertion.Lately, Ive come to framethe challenge as a question: Can we foster an online (and real-life) culture in which veracity is cool? Youll see more on this here in the coming months.Early on, I tested various ways to annotate important speeches and documents. But I never had the time to refine such tools or sustain the effort. In 2011, I used Mediabugs, an online tool aimed at correcting errors in news articles, to challenge assertions in a Breitbart report on cosmic rays and climate. Sadly, Mediabugs is defunct, mainly because it required buy-in from news websites  most of which are not quick to embrace external critiques. I hope youll listen to my chat with Scott Rosenberg, who was one of Mediabugs developers.I was encouraged to see the 2011 launch of Hypothes.is, an open Web annotation tool developed by Dan Whaley and others, and its evolution and wider adoption since. The modest goal now is annotating all knowledge. Doing so in a way that adds value and meaning in our world of #TMI overload is the challenge. Learn more about the roots and goals of Hypothesisin Annotating the scholarly web, a recent article in Nature by Jeffrey M. Perkel. Marc Perton has an invaluable broader piece in Newsweek on the merits and limits of online annotation, focusing on both Hypothesis and Genius.For Dot Earth readers, the most relevant use of the Hypothesis toolso far is byClimate Feedback, through which a large (and hopefully growing) network of scientists studying climate change and related subjects is applying a layer of external peer review and a reliability rating to news articles and commentary on global warming.Read on foran introduction toClimate Feedback and description of expansion plans written by its associate editor, Daniel Nethery, and founder, Emmanuel Vincent (the commentary was first published in The Guardian):Climate scientists are now grading climate journalism\n\nBy Daniel Nethery and fEmmanuel VincentThe Internet represents an extraordinary opportunity for democracy. Never before has it been possible for people from all over the world to access the latest information and collectively seek solutions to the challenges which face our planet, and not a moment too soon: the year 2015 was the hottest in human history, and the Great Barrier Reef issuffering the consequences of warming oceans right now.Yet despitethe scientific consensusthat global warming is real and primarily due to human activity,studiesshowthat only about half the population in some countries with among the highest CO2emissions per capita understand that human beings are the driving force of our changing climate. Evenfewer people are aware of the scientific consensuson this question. We live in an information age, but the information isnt getting through. How can this be?While the Internet puts information at our fingertips, it has also allowed misinformation to sow doubt and confusion in the minds of many of those whose opinions and votes will determine the future of the planet. And up to now scientists have been on the back foot in countering the spread of this misinformation and pointing the public to trustworthy sources of information on climate change.Climate Feedbackintends to change that. It brings together a global network of scientists who usea newweb-annotation platformto provide feedback on climate change reporting. Their comments, which bring context and insights from the latest research, and point out factual and logical errors where they exist, remain layered over the target article in the public domain. You can read them for yourself, right in your browser. The scientists also provide a score on a five-point scale to let you know whether the article is consistent with the science. For the first time, Climate Feedback allows you to check whether you can trust the latest breaking story on climate change.Last year the scientists looked at some influential content. Take the Popes encyclical, for instance. The scientists gave those parts of the encyclical relating to climate science a stamp of approval. [Explore their comments here.]Other feedbacks, as we call them, have made a lasting impact. When the scientists found that an article inThe Telegraph misrepresented recent research by claiming that the world faced an impending ice age, the newspaperissued a public correction and substantially modified the online text.But theres more work to be done. Toward the end of the year the scientists carried out a series of evaluations of some of Forbes magazines reporting on climate change. The results give an idea of the scale of the problem were tackling. Two of the magazines most popular articles for 2015, one of which attracted almost one million hits, turned out to beprofoundly inaccurate and misleading. Both articles, reviewed by nine and twelve scientists, unanimously received the lowest possible scientific credibility rating. This rarely occurs, and just in case youre wondering, yes, the scientists do score articles independently: ratings are only revealed once all scientists have completed their review.We argue that scientists have a moral duty to speak up when they see misinformation masquerading as science. Up to now scientists have however had little choice but to engage in time-consuming op-ed exchanges, which result in one or two high-profile scientists arguing against the views of an individual who may have no commitment to scientific accuracy at all. Climate Feedback takes a different approach. Our collective reviews allow scientists from all over the world to provide feedback in a timely, effective manner. We then publish an accessible synthesis of their responses, and provide feedback to editors so that they can improve the accuracy of their reporting.Weve got proof of concept. Now we need to scale up, and for that we need the support of everyone who values accuracy in reporting on one of the most critical challenges facing our planet. Climate Feedback wont reach its full potential until we start measuring the credibility of news outlets in a systematic way. We want to be in a position to carry out an analysis of any influential internet article on climate change. We want to develop a Scientific Trust Tracker  an index of how credible major news sources are when it comes to climate change.Were all increasingly relying on the Internet to get our news. But the Internet has engendered a competitive media environment where in the race to attract the most hits, sensational headlines can trump sober facts. Were building into the system a new incentive for journalists with integrity to get ahead. Some journalists are already coming to us, asking our network of scientists to look at their work. We want readers to know which sources they can trust. We want editors to think twice before they publish ideological rather than evidence-based reporting on global warming.On Friday, 22 April, 2016, more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate agreement. But this unprecedented international treaty will lead to real action only if the leaders of those countries can garner popular support for the measures needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The fate of the Paris deal lies largely in the hands of voters in democratic countries, and we cannot expect democracies to produce good policy responses to challenges of climate change if voters have a confused understanding of reality.Scientists from all over the world are standing up for better informed democracies. You can help them make their voices heard. We invite you to stand with us for a better Internet. We invite you tostand with science.For more on the benefits and drawbacks of this effort, click back to Tom Zellers article on Climate Feedback in Forbes andLaura Dattaros piece for Columbia Journalism Review.One big issue, of course, is that you can only see the scientists comments if youre using the tool, just like youd reach fora pair of reading glasses to gain a clearer view. That makes this project somewhat likeDot Earth Defender  a bit of software that, years ago, created a screen blocking ones view of commenters deemed non-constructive. Both could simply reinforce tribalism rather than building a bigger tribe focused on reality.This leads back to my open question: Can we foster a culture in which veracity is more valuable than ones cultural identity as a liberal or libertarian, group hugger or individualist?That, to me, is the only route by which this effort will spread beyond a small societal sector eager for reality  like the folks who visit this blog. Another issue can be a cultural bias in those doing the critiquing. Will they be as assiduous in grading pieces that overstate the significance of some single-study finding pointing to climate doom as they are with coverage challenging climate alarm?Because Climate Feedback is a step in the right direction, I chipped in a very modest contribution to their crowd-funding effort. You can do so here.Heres their pitch:"}
{"text": "KANDAHAR, Afghanistan  The Afghan security forces began a push to break the Talibans hold on a crucial southern highway through Oruzgan Province, officials said on Monday, hoping to ease the insurgents intensifying siege of an important provincial capital.While the most public and urgent security concerns in the south have been focused on the fighting in Helmand Province in recent months, the insurgency has also been slowly choking the city of Tirin Kot, the provincial capital of Oruzgan.The province next door, where many of Talibans founding leaders hail from, became a softer target for the insurgency last year. Since the mysterious assassination in March 2015 of Gen. Matiullah Khan, the former police chief and strongman who largely kept the insurgents at bay, the provinces security leadership has fallen into chaos.Now, Tirin Kot has been cut off from most of its surrounding districts. Last week, the Taliban overran dozens of outposts on the highway connecting the city to Kandahar, the southern regional economic and military hub, according to Muhammad Karim Khadimzai, the head of the Oruzgan provincial council.The highways closing has raised food prices in Tirin Kot and districts nearby, and increased fears that the insurgents might take the city, Mr. Khadimzai said.The security situation is deteriorating in Oruzgan day by day, he said. We only have access to Chora district, which is close to the capital; the rest of the districts are cut off from the provincial center.A stronger Taliban foothold in Oruzgan would further destabilize the surrounding areas, including Kandahar, and large parts of central Afghanistan. While Kandahar has remained relatively safe as other parts of southern Afghanistan has come under fire from the territory-gobbling insurgency, the province is vulnerable in the districts bordering Oruzgan and Helmand.The operation to clear the highway connecting Kandahar to Tirin Kot, as well as the surrounding districts, was led by Lt. Gen. Abdul Raziq, the powerful police chief of Kandahar.Clearance operations are ongoing in several districts in Kandahar, including Shawalikot and Mianshin, which is key to reopening the highway, said Zia Durani, a spokesman for the Kandahar police.On Sunday morning, engineering units trying came under fire while trying to clear Taliban land mines around the highway, Mr. Durani said. He said that 45 Taliban fighters were killed in the six-hour battle, including two senior commanders for Kandahar Province.Since the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001, Oruzgan has been largely run by strongmen allied with former President Hamid Karzai through his Popalzai tribe.One of those was General Khan, the powerful Oruzgan figure who made a fortune as a highway militia leader providing security escort to NATO convoys. He was killed in a targeted suicide bombing in downtown Kabul.Soon after his death, General Khans younger brother, Rahimullah Khan, demanded to be appointed police chief despite lacking formal military experience or basic literacy. The central government, realizing that much of the police force in Oruzgan was made up of General Khans escort militia, reached a compromise with Rahimullah, appointing him deputy police chief.Security officials say Rahimullah Khans lack of experience and mismanagement, including abandoning checkpoints in several districts including around the highway, has been one factor in the Talibans gaining ground. A widespread security collapse in Oruzgan was narrowly avoided four months ago only after the army stepped into push back the Taliban."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO  WhatsApp, a messaging service owned by Facebook, was shut down in Brazil on Monday after a court order from a judge who is seeking user data from the service for a criminal investigation.Judge Marcel Maia Montalvo ordered telecom companies operating in Brazil to suspend WhatsApp nationwide for 72 hours. As of just after midday Monday, Brazilians said they could not use the popular messaging service.The shutdown is the latest twist in a case that has embroiled WhatsApp in legal trouble. The case, which is under seal, involves an organized crime and drug trafficking investigation in the court in Lagarto, in the northeastern state of Sergipe. The court has been seeking data from WhatsApp to aid in the investigation. Diego Dzodan, a Facebook executive, was briefly taken into custody in March for refusing to comply with orders to turn over WhatsApp information in the case.The judge who ordered WhatsApps shutdown on Monday is the same one who ordered Mr. Dzodans arrest. Mr. Dzodan was released after one night when a higher court judge said the arrest was an extreme measure.This decision punishes more than 100 million Brazilians who rely on our services, a WhatsApp spokesman said of the shutdown, adding that the company had cooperated to the full extent of our ability with local courts.The shutdown is the second time a Brazilian judge has ordered a nationwide ban of WhatsApp in the last few months. In December, a judge in So Paulo ordered telecommunications carriers to block WhatsApp for 48 hours because it had not complied with police eavesdropping requests in a separate criminal drug case.An appeals court overturned the ban the same day it took effect, saying that it was not reasonable to suspend a service used by so many people simply because the company had not provided information sought by the courts.A debate over law enforcement access to tech companies data has been raging. In the United States, Apple recently grappled with a court order asking it to help unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist. Apple refused, leading to a standoff with the United States government that was tabled when the F.B.I. found an alternate way into the device.American tech companies and law enforcement are now sparring over access to digital data in other venues, including Washington, where many are lobbying over a new draft encryption bill released last month by Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee.Concern is growing in Brazil that its Congress may pass laws that would weaken digital privacy. One measure calls for Internet companies to remove content deemed critical of politicians within 48 hours, while another calls for imprisonment for violating an Internets sites terms of use. The proposals worry many Internet privacy advocates, including the authors of Brazils widely respected Internet bill of rights or Marco Civil.The full Congress is considering several of these proposals and could vote on them this week.On Monday, Brazilians took to Twitter to lament the loss of WhatsApp, which is used there as much by professionals as by students. But some appreciated the respite. @IZATLEITE, a Twitter user, wrote, now without WhatsApp, Ill finally be able to read without being disturbed or interrupted."}
{"text": "Colorados Supreme Court on Monday struck down local government prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, handing oil and gas companies a victory in a lengthy battle over energy production in the environmentally conscious state.In separate rulings, the court said a moratorium in Fort Collins  and a ban in Longmont were invalid because state law pre-empted them. A lower court had reached the same conclusion earlier.Two other cities and Boulder County have prohibitions on fracking that presumably are affected by the decisions. With oil and gas exploration in a slump nationwide, the short-term effect of the rulings in Colorado will be small, industry officials said.But when the slump ends, activity in urban areas across the Front Range  the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains and Colorados most populous region, where oil and gas production is concentrated  could be significant.The land opened to exploration by Mondays rulings is comparatively small. More significant, said experts on both sides of the conflict, is that the rulings shut down future efforts to stop fracking in local jurisdictions.Officials of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association said the decisions go beyond prohibitions on oil and gas operations, preventing localities from imposing any rules on those operations that conflict with state laws and regulations.Colorados regulation of oil and gas production is the most stringent in the nation, said Dan Haley, the associations president. This continues to protect citizens and continues to protect the water and air in Colorado, but allows our operators to develop natural resources that have been off-limits for a number of years.Officials in Fort Collins and Longmont said they were disappointed by the rulings. Environmental groups said the rulings would give new momentum to efforts to force a statewide referendum.The Supreme Court has approved signature-collecting efforts for three fracking-related ballot initiatives; the two most significant would effectively reinstate local control over fracking and other activities, and outlaw fracking within 2,500 feet of occupied buildings, waterways and public open spaces.Supporters must gather nearly 100,000 signatures by August for each of the initiatives to place them on the November ballot. I think this is definitely going to add fuel to the fire for folks to get out there and help get these initiatives passed, said Lauren Petrie, a senior organizer at Food and Water Watch in Colorado, an opponent of fracking.Spurred by the rise of hydraulic fracturing, Colorado has become one of the nations largest producers of oil and gas. The state has more than 50,000 active oil and gas wells.Environmental advocates say that the Front Range oil and gas boom has contributed significantly to an ozone haze that sometimes blankets the area, and that a coming report will show that well leaks of methane, a greenhouse gas, are common. They also argue that the chemicals used in fracking can leach into water and pose significant health hazards.Mr. Haley, of the oil and gas association, said Colorados strict rules have led to a reduction in pollution from wells even as oil and gas production rose in recent years.Colorado is one of several states where the oil and gas industry has faced citizen-led efforts to ban fracking. New York has banned fracking statewide, and Pennsylvania has granted local government authority over hydraulic fracturing. The Texas Legislature responded last year to one citys ban on fracking with a law that pre-empts local control over a broad range of drilling activities.Gov. Jerry Brown of California came out against a fracking ban last year, but advocacy groups are waging a statewide campaign to place a ban on the ballot.Its 2 to 2, and Californias still in play, said Bruce Baizel, the energy program director for Earthworks, an environmental advocacy group that focuses on mining and energy exploration."}

{"text": "FRANKFURT  The head of development for Porsche has left the automaker seven months after he was suspended for possible involvement in Volkswagens emissions cheating scandal, Porsche said Tuesday.Wolfgang Hatz, 57, a well-known figure in motoring circles, left Porsche at his own request, the company said. Mr. Hatz was suspended in September soon after Volkswagen, which is Porsches parent company, admitted rigging diesel engines to evade emissions tests.Porsche said in a statement Tuesday that an internal investigation had found no evidence that Mr. Hatz shared responsibility for the emissions cheating. But he decided to leave the company in light of the continuing investigation and suspension, Porsche said.Volkswagen diesel vehicles, as well as some Audi and Porsche models, were programmed to run emissions controls at full capacity only when the cars were being tested. At other times they flouted pollution limits.Mr. Hatz, the former head of engine and transmission development at Volkswagen, helped develop the motor at the center of the emissions scandal. He was also a critic of the pollution regulations imposed on automakers.In 2007, shortly after being named head of engine and transmission development at Volkswagen, Mr. Hatz complained at an event in San Francisco that new rules on tailpipe emissions in California were unrealistic.I see it as nearly impossible for us, Mr. Hatz said of a proposed regulation during the event, which was filmed by an auto website.As recently as February, Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Porsche, said he would like to bring Mr. Hatz back to the company. In a statement Tuesday, Wolfgang Porsche, a member of the family that founded the sports-car maker and the largest shareholder in Volkswagen, praised Mr. Hatzs outstanding work and gave him credit for reviving Porsches racing program.Mr. Hatz had overseen Porsches famed development and testing center in Weissach, Germany, since 2011. He was responsible for the introduction of the 918 Spyder, a plug-in hybrid super sports car that can accelerate from zero to 60 miles an hour in less than three seconds.Mr. Hatz will be succeeded by Michael Steiner, 51, who has held various management positions in Porsche research and development, most recently as head of quality."}
{"text": "Young rats prone to obesity are much less likely to fulfill that unhappy destiny if they run during adolescence than if they do not, according to a provocative new animal study of exercise and weight. They also were metabolically healthier, and had different gut microbes, than rats that keep the weight off by cutting back on food, the study found. The experiment was done in rodents, not people, but it does raise interesting questions about just what role exercise may play in keeping obesity at bay.For some time, many scientists, dieting gurus and I have been pointing out that exercise by itself tends to be ineffective for weight loss. Study after study has found that if overweight people start working out but do not also reduce their caloric intake, they shed little if any poundage and may gain weight.The problem, most scientists agree, is that exercise increases appetite, especially in people who are overweight, and also can cause compensatory inactivity, meaning that people move less over all on days when they exercise. Consequently, they wind up burning fewer daily calories, while also eating more. You do the math.But those discouraging studies involved weight loss. There has been much less examination of whether exercise might help to prevent weight gain in the first place and, if it does, how it compares to calorie restriction for that purpose.So for the new study, which was published last week in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers at the University of Missouri in Columbia and other schools first gathered rats from a strain that has an inborn tendency to become obese, starting in adolescence. (Adolescence is also when many young people begin to add weight.)These rats were young enough, though, that they were not yet overweight.After weighing them, the researchers divided the animals into three groups.One group was allowed to eat as much kibble as they wished and to remain sedentary in their cages. These were the controls.Another group, the exercise group, also was able to eat at will, but these animals were provided with running wheels in their cages. Rats like to run, and the animals willingly hopped on the wheels, exercising every day.The final group, the dieting group, was put on a calorie-restricted meal plan. Their daily kibble helpings were about 20 percent smaller than the amount that the runners ate, a portion size designed to keep them at about the same weight as the runners, so that extreme differences in body size would not affect the final results.After 11 weeks, all of the animals were moved to specialized cages that could measure their metabolisms and how much they moved around. They then returned to their assigned cages for several more weeks, by which time they were effectively middle-aged.At that point, the control animals were obese, their physiques larded with fat.The runners and the lower-calorie groups, however, although they also had gained ounces, had put on far less weight than the controls. None were obese.Both exercise and portion control, in other words, had effectively protected the animals against their fated fatness.But beneath the skin, the runners and the dieters looked very unalike. By almost all measures, the runners were metabolically healthier, with better insulin sensitivity and lower levels of bad cholesterol than the dieters. They also burned more fat each day for fuel, according to their metabolic readings, and had more cellular markers related to metabolic activity within their brown fat than the dieting group. Brown fat, unlike the white variety, can be quite metabolically active, helping the body to burn additional calories.Interestingly, the runners also had developed different gut microbes than the dieters,  even though they ate the same food. The runners had greater percentages of some bacteria and smaller populations of others than the dieters or the control group; these particular proportions of gut bugs have been associated in a few previous studies with long-term leanness in both animals and people.Perhaps most striking, the runners showed no signs of compensatory eating or compensatory inactivity, said Victoria Vieira-Potter, an assistant professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri who oversaw the study. They didnt scarf down more food than the control group, despite running several miles every day and, according to the specialized cages, actually moved around more when not exercising than either of the other groups of rats.In essence, the runners, while weighing the same as the dieters at the end of the study, seemed better set up to avoid weight gain in the future.Of course, these were rats, which do not share our human biology or our tangled psychological relationships with food and body fat.This study also involved young, normal-weight rodents and cannot tell us whether exercise or dieting alone or in combination would aid or hinder weight loss in people (or animals) who already are overweight, Dr. Vieira-Potter said. Metabolisms change once a body contains large amounts of fat, and it becomes increasingly difficult to permanently drop those extra pounds.So better to avoid weight gain in the first place, if possible. And in that context, she said, restricting calories can be effective, but exercise is likely to be more potent in the long term and, of course, as common sense would tell us, doing bothwatching what you eat and exercisingis best of all.Related:Interested in running?

{"text": "A general election that pits Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump will produce a decisively more affluent and better educated Democratic presidential electorate and a decidedly  less affluent and less educated Republican one than in any previous election going back as far as 1976.It is no secret that Trump is the driving force behind this years reconfigured coalition on the right. He has successfully appealed to middle- and lower-income white voters motivated by opposition to liberalized attitudes and social norms on matters of race, immigration and womens rights.Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm, analyzed a survey conducted in April by NBC and The Wall Street Journal. Respondents were asked to choose between Clinton and Trump, and the results demonstrate that there will be substantial shifts in the income and education levels of Democratic and Republican voters, at least as far as this presidential election is concerned.One of the largest shifts is among college-educated voters, who are expected to defect from the Republican Party by the millions if Trump is the nominee. In 2012, President Obama lost college-educated voters by four points; this year, according to Public Opinion Strategies analysis, Clinton will win them by 29 points.In addition, the NBC/WSJ poll reveals that Clinton should make substantial gains among voters from households earning in excess of $100,000. While Obama lost these affluent voters in 2012 by 10 points, the NBC/WSJ survey shows Clinton carrying them by 12 points.There are two groups among whom Trump will gain and Clinton will lose: voters making less than $30,000 and voters with high school degrees. Both less affluent groups are expected to increase their level of support for the Republican nominee over their 2012 margins, by 13 and by 17 points.For the Democratic presidential coalition in 2016, the net effect of this shift will be to further reverse the working class tilt of the party, which has been trending upscale since 1992. The Republican coalition of 2016, in fact, will look increasingly like the Democratic Party of the 1930s.A Trump versus Clinton contest will deepen the partisan divisions that have set those who support the social and cultural revolutions of the past five decades on race, immigration, womens rights, gender equality and gay rights  as well as the broader right to sexual privacy  against those who remain in opposition.First, lets take race.Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, examined answers to racial resentment questions in a Presidential Election Panel Survey conduced by the RAND Corporation in December and January to see how the responses correlated with presidential voting intentions.The racial resentment scale is based on favorable or unfavorable responses to survey questions like this:In addition, the RAND survey sought to measure ethnocentrism by asking respondents to rank their own racial or ethnic group on a seven-point scale for lazy or hardworking, intelligent or unintelligent and trustworthy or untrustworthy. The respondents were then asked to rate other groups by the same measures. Those ranking their own race or ethnic group higher than others ranked high on ethnocentrism.Teslers findings are illustrated in the accompanying chart. There was a dose effect: The higher you scored on racial resentment, the more likely you were to support Trump; the more you resented immigrants or professed your white ethnocentrism, the likelier you were to plan to vote for Trump.On March 3, Tesler and John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, published an article in the Washington Post: How political science helps explain the rise of Trump: the role of white identity and grievances. Using data collected by American National Election Studies, Tesler and Sides ranked white respondents by their level of white racial identity  determined by asking white respondents questions like How important is being white to your identity?; How important is it that whites work together to change laws that are unfair to whites?; and How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead?In each case, Trumps level of support in the survey rose in direct proportion to your level of agreement with each of these statements.Trump has also recruited strong support from those who have not come to terms with the womens rights, reproductive rights and gay rights movements.Ron Lesthaeghe and Lisa Neidert of the University of Michigans Population Studies Center have done pioneering work that sheds more light on Trumps success so far. They have ranked all 3,140 counties in the United States by their level of entry into what researchers call the second demographic transition.The Second Demographic Transition: A Concise Overview of Its Development, by Lesthaeghe, summarizes this concept:These revolutions have reordered much of society. Lesthaeghe continues:The second accompanying chart summarizes the key cultural and social transformations put into effect by this demographic transition.Measured by these criteria, the top-ranked counties were cosmopolitan centers, with a larger percentage of affluent, highly educated residents: New York City, the District of Columbia, Pitkin County, Colo. (where Aspen is), San Francisco and Marin County, Calif. The counties at the bottom tended to be small, white, rural, poor and less educated and they were located in the South and the Mountain West: Millard County, Utah (population 12,662), Loup County, Neb. (pop. 576), Perry County, Miss. (pop. 12,131), and Roberts County, Tex. (pop. 831).To see where Trump has been getting his strongest support in terms of the Lesthaeghe-Neidert measures, it is useful to look at county level results from the Republican presidential primaries in four states: Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Tennessee. With rare exceptions, the same pattern emerged in all four states: the lower the S.D.T. ranking, the higher Trumps votes compared with his statewide average; the higher the S.D.T. level, the lower Trumps vote. In many cases, the spread was 10 percentage points or more.Take Manhattan. In these rankings, it is the highest of the 3,140 counties in the United States. Trump won the entire state of New York with 60.4 percent of the primary vote. In Manhattan, however, Trump lost to John Kasich, the more moderate candidate, 41.8 percent to 45.2 percent.Or take two Virginia counties, Arlington and Alexandria, which rank high on the S.D.T. list at seven and eight. Trump carried all of Virginia with about 35 percent of the vote (Marco Rubio came in second, with about 32 percent), but in Alexandria and Arlington, Trump won only 18.8 percent and 16.8 percent.Compare that with two Texas counties, Tyler and St. Augustine, which rank near the bottom in the S.D.T. ratings. Trump lost Texas to his former opponent, Ted Cruz, 43.8 percent to 26.7 percent. In St. Augustine, Trump outperformed his statewide results, winning 39.6 of the countys votes, a 12.9 point improvement. In Tyler, Trump received 35.9 percent, 9.2 points better than his statewide average.Similarly, in Ohio, Trump exceeded his statewide average in 15 out of 18 counties ranked near the bottom on the Lesthaeghe-Neidert scale, while falling well below his statewide percentage in four metropolitan counties  Franklin, Delaware, Cuyahoga and Hamilton  near the top of the rankings.The nomination of Donald Trump will sharpen and deepen the Republican Partys core problems. Trump gains the party ground among declining segments of the population  less well educated, less well off whites  and loses ground with the growing constituencies: single women, well-educated men and women, minorities, the affluent and professionals.This is especially true in the case of Trumps dependence on support from communities at the bottom of the Lesthaeghe-Neidert S.D.T. scale. Not only are more and more Americans adopting the practices and values described by Lesthaeghe and Neidert  self-expressiveness, gender equality, cohabitation, same-sex couples, postponed marriage and childbearing  but so too is much of the developed world.This transition has effectively become the norm in much of Europe, and as Lesthaeghe points out, it is gaining ground in regions as diverse as East Asia and Latin America.In this country, the transition has led to partisan schism. For decades now, the Republican Party has been conducting a racial and cultural counterrevolution. It proved a successful strategy from 1966 to 1992. Since then, as the percentage of Americans on the liberal side of the culture wars has grown steadily, the counterrevolutionary approach has become more and more divisive.In this respect, Trump is not, as many charge, violating core Republican tenets. Instead, he represents the culmination of the rear-guard action that has characterized the party for decades. There is a chance that Trump will bring new blood into a revitalized Republican coalition. Its also possible that he will accelerate the Republican Partys downward spiral into irrelevance."}
{"text": "Mychal Denzel Smith isnt operating a branch of Niketown from his tiny bedroom in Bushwick, Brooklyn. It only looks that way.There are two over-the-door shoe organizers full of sneakers, and a metal retail display rack against the wall cant fit another pair. A column of unopened Nike shoe boxes teeters over the bed, reaching nearly as high as the bookshelf next to it that is crammed with classics of black literature past and present, like Notes of a Native Son by James Baldwin, and How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America by Kiese Laymon.A few pairs of high-top basketball shoes rest on a plastic container at the foot of the bed, the first thing Mr. Smith sees when he wakes in this apartment he shares with three roommates.Man, this is a lot of sneakers, you say, taking it all in.There are more under the bed, Mr. Smith pointed out, trying to telegraph that he isnt a hoarder, just a sneakerhead. What do I spend my money on? he said. I spend it on what you see: books and shoes.Mr. Smith, a contributing writer at The Nation and an Alfred Knobler Fellow at the Nation Institute, didnt always have so many sneakers, upward of 200 pairs by last rough count. For a while, he mostly wore Converse Chuck Taylors.When I moved to New York, I was a broke, broke freelancer, he said, standing amid his collection. Shoes were not in the budget.But Mr. Smith, 29, soon began appearing on TV as a commentator and signed a deal for his first book, Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching, an impassioned memoir that will be published June 14 and aims to capture what its like to be young, black and male in America today. And with success came sneakers.In fact, one can chart Mr. Smiths last few years in New York through the kicks he bought to mark big events. A life story told in shoes, if you will. Lets start with the Nike Air Jordan 3 Retro Infrared 23 pair.Mr. Smith bought them at the Footaction store on 34th Street near Eighth Avenue after he earned a raise from his employer.Id never had a pair of Air Jordan 3s before, he said. Theyre the first shoe that Jordan did with Tinker Hatfield, who is Nikes golden god in terms of design. They have a huge place in the Jordan legacy.The shoes  white-and-black high-tops, with the gray above-sole pattern known to aficionados as elephant print  were heavy in the rotation after Mr. Smith got them. So much so that the toe crease is no longer fresh and he is thinking about donating them.These days, he is more enamored by another pair of Nikes, the Air Jordan 11, which he calls the greatest sneaker of all time. They were worn by Michael Jordan during the 1995-96 season when the Chicago Bulls went 72-10, then a record, and won the championship. (This season, the Golden State Warriors bettered that record by a game, at 73-9.)But perhaps the shoes are meaningful because Mr. Smiths parents refused to buy them for him as a child.I remember them saying, Were not buying an 11-year-old child patent-leather sneakers, Mr. Smith said with a laugh.So after he signed his book deal in 2014, he bought a reissued pair. He called the patent-leather design forward thinking, adding that it was meant as a dress-up sneaker.Lifting his foot to show the shoes he was wearing ( Air Jordan 1s in a white, orange and black colorway known as the shattered backboard), Mr. Smith explained that he wore them to a debate at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, in Harlem, to shatter expectations of respectability.I kind of throw it in peoples faces a little bit, he said. Because I know theres an association people make with sneakers with a lack of intelligence, a lack of engagement with the world, with black youth, with wayward black youth.Marc Lamont Hill, 37, an author and Distinguished Professor of African American Studies at Morehouse College who has been a mentor to Mr. Smith, said that Mr. Smith brings hip-hop attitude and style to the role of public intellectual.Typically the price of entry to be on TV is you have to put on the suit, you have to put on the tie, Dr. Hill said. Hip-hop is about interrupting spaces. Mychal really likes to dress like that. Its quintessentially hip-hop.Mr. Smith said: I need to wear my sneakers. Thats when I feel most myself.Given the love of sneakers and hip-hop, one might assume he owns a pair or two of Yeezy Boosts, the fashion sneakers Kanye West designs for Adidas.In Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching, which takes its title from a line in the 1999 Mos Def song Hip Hop, Mr. Smith professes his admiration for Mr. Wests music, and describes the moment in 2005 when the rapper called out President Bush during a telethon for Hurricane Katrina victims as spurring a political awakening in him.But Mr. Smith doesnt own a pair of Yeezys. I dont like the look of them, he said. Kanye is meaningful to me. I just dont like his sneakers.With a few exceptions, what Mr. Smith likes are high-top Nike basketball shoes, particularly Jordans. More than a decade after the player retired from the game, he still holds tremendous appeal in the sneaker world, even among young black men like Mr. Smith, who wasnt born when Mr. Jordan debuted in the National Basketball Association in 1984.In his book, Mr. Smith criticizes Mr. Jordan for not being an outspoken political athlete in the way Muhammad Ali was.But Mr. Smith also thinks that by his bodily genius on the court, the basketball star represented something important to black men. He embodied a certain black cool, a black masculine cool that everyone wanted to emulate, Mr. Smith said during the interview in his apartment.Buying and wearing big, bold, brightly colored sneakers is a way to be associated with Mr. Jordans cool factor and worldwide visibility.When Im wearing a pair of Jordans, I feel more confident, Mr. Smith said. I walk taller. I walk straighter.He opened a shoe box at the foot of his bed and pulled out a pair of Air Jordan 1s in the classic red-white-and-black colorway, a 30th anniversary reissue of the 1985 high-top that started it all.He bought them after he finished the manuscript for his book, and got a second pair for his editor as a gift, for seeing him through the writing process.I knew exactly what I wanted, Mr. Smith said. I finished my first book, Im buying the first Air Jordans.He still hasnt worn them. He is saving them for the first promotional event for his book, a reading at Barnes & Noble on the Upper West Side on June 9.Mr. Smith laid them back into the box. Got to keep the toes fresh."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The capital regions subway system has failed to adequately learn from a series of dangerous and sometimes fatal episodes in recent years, making little or no progress toward instituting a culture of safety, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded on Tuesday.The assessment came as the board discussed the findings of a more than yearlong investigation into a fatal instance of smoke filling a tunnel in January 2015.Its conclusion painted the most complete picture to date of the how the aging infrastructure, flawed safety response and inadequate local and federal oversight combined to cause the event, which killed one person and injured 91 others.But the investigation also allowed the board members to express concerns about how the nations second busiest subway system has acted  or not acted  to address prominent safety lapses.When the N.T.S.B. finds itself issuing a continuous stream of accident reports to address the basic safety management of a single transit rail system, something is fundamentally flawed, Christopher A. Hart, the boards chairman, said. Here, that something is safety oversight.The report came as the newly installed managers of the transit agency, known here as Metro, grapple with several high-profile setbacks and continuing funding woes facing the system.The N.T.S.B. members acknowledged that Metro, under that leadership, appeared now to be taking steps in the right direction and offered more than 30 recommendations to the authorities involved in the incident, primarily involving maintenance and safety training.They also renewed their criticism of the Federal Transit Administration, which has overseen the systems safety since October, arguing that it does not have the ability, the experience or the disciplinary authority to do its job adequately.Instead, Mr. Hart and other board members said, Metro should be reclassified as a commuter rail system and its oversight moved to the better-established Federal Railroad Administration until authorities here conclude their long-stalled efforts to create a federally approved local safety oversight body.That suggestion prompted a response after the meeting from Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, who defended the F.T.A. in a letter released to the board and said it should continue its oversight of Metro.Though many of the investigations findings were forecast in a preliminary report in the days after the smoke event and during investigative hearings last June, the final report gave a step-by-step account of what went wrong and who was to blame.Investigators concluded that the Jan. 12, 2015, episode was caused by a prolonged short circuit that consumed power system components that had been allowed to lapse under ineffective inspection and maintenance practices.Water that contaminated the faulted cable, a dearth of smoke detectors in Metros tunnels, ventilation fans that did not work properly, and staff that was not trained in how to use them exacerbated the problem, the N.T.S.B. said.The board also said that city fire and emergency services were not prepared to respond to such an event.Whatever could go wrong that afternoon did go wrong, Robert L. Sumwalt, a member of the board, said, while questioning N.T.S.B. investigators. To quote a Shakespearean play, it was a comedy of errors. Except, it was not funny.N.T.S.B. members made frequent comparisons to conclusions reached in a similar investigation after a 2009 train collision that killed nine people near the citys outskirts.Top Metro officials attended Tuesdays meeting. Paul J. Wiedefeld, its new general manager, is expected to announce a systemwide maintenance plan in the coming weeks.And on Monday, in advance of the safety boards report, Metro took steps to address at least one of its concerns, announcing that it would station a fire department official at its operations control center at all times to help coordinate emergency responses."}
{"text": "A general election matchup between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton became all but certain on Tuesday after Mr. Trumps decisive victory in Indiana.He would begin that matchup at a significant disadvantage.Yes, its still a long way until Election Day. And Mr. Trump has already upended the conventional wisdom many times. But this is when early horse-race polls start to give a rough sense of the November election, and Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton by around 10 percentage points in early general election surveys, both nationally and in key battleground states.He even trails in some polls of several states where Mitt Romney won in 2012, like North Carolina, Arizona, Missouri and Utah.Could Mr. Trump overtake Mrs. Clinton? Sure. Mrs. Clinton is very unpopular herself. Her polling lead is a snapshot in time, before the barrage of attack ads that are sure to come her way. There have been 10-point shifts over the general election season before, even if its uncommon. But there isnt much of a precedent for huge swings in races with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. A majority of Americans may not like her, but they say theyre scared of him. To have a chance, hell need to change that.Mr. Trumps biggest problem is that he would be the most unpopular major party nominee in the modern era, with nearly two-thirds saying they have an unfavorable opinion of him. More than half view him very unfavorably or say theyre scared of his candidacy  figures with no precedent among modern presidential nominees.Mr. Trumps ratings are worst with the voters who made up the so-called Obama coalition of young, nonwhite and well-educated voters who propelled President Obamas re-election four years ago.In some ways, Mrs. Clinton is not a natural fit to reunite Mr. Obamas supporters  especially the younger voters who have overwhelmingly preferred Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. But whatever challenges she may have among these groups dissipate against Mr. Trump. Recent surveys even show her leading among 18- to 29-year-old voters by a larger margin than Mr. Obamas when he won them four years ago.Mrs. Clintons strength among young, nonwhite and well-educated voters would be enough to make her a favorite. The G.O.P. path to victory without adding some of these voters is narrow. The Republicans would need to do nearly as well among white voters as Ronald Reagan did in his 18-point re-election landslide in 1984 merely to fight to a draw in todays far more diverse country. Nonwhite voters could make up nearly 30 percent of the electorate in 2016, up from 14 percent in 1984.But what raises the possibility of a more decisive defeat for Mr. Trump is that he is struggling to reunite the voters who supported Mr. Romney  especially white women and white college-educated voters.A recent ABC/Washington Post poll showed Mr. Trump with just a 29 percent favorability rating among white women and 23 percent among white college graduates, while 68 percent and 74 percent had an unfavorable opinion.Mr. Trump is faring worse than Mr. Romney among white voters in all of the presidential battleground states. Polls even show Mr. Trump losing white voters in states where Mr. Romney won them, like Colorado, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Its enough to put him at a big disadvantage in early surveys of diverse battleground states like Florida and Virginia  as well as North Carolina and Arizona, two states Mr. Romney won in 2012.Mr. Trump has even trailed in a poll in strongly Republican Utah, which is one of the best-educated states in the country. Its unlikely that Mrs. Clinton could win Utah in the end, but its nonetheless telling that Mr. Trump trails in a survey of a state where Democrats have not reached 35 percent of the vote in the last 11 presidential elections.The Trump campaigns aim to compete in industrial Democratic-leaning states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio has not looked promising either. Thats in part because of his broader challenge with well-educated whites (a recent NBC/Marist survey showed Mr. Trump trailing by 29 points in the Philadelphia suburbs), but its also because he isnt connecting among white working-class Democrats the way the campaign had hoped.The same NBC/Marist survey showed Mrs. Clinton leading in western Pennsylvania, where Mr. Obama lost many registered Democrats to Mr. Romney.Part of the problem for Mr. Trump is that the anger that has driven his success in the Republican primaries isnt seen at the same levels in the general electorate.A majority of Americans now narrowly approve of Mr. Obamas performance  a big improvement from his standing in surveys ahead of the midterm elections, when his ratings were decidedly negative. An ABC/Washington Post poll found that just 24 percent of Americans were angry at the federal government.There also isnt much evidence that Americans are particularly dissatisfied with the state of the economy. The unemployment rate is at 5 percent, and gas prices are low. Consumer and economic confidence indicators are well within historical norms.By all of these measures, national political and economic conditions are more favorable to the presidents party than they were at this time in 2012, when Mr. Obama won re-election. These indicators might make Mrs. Clinton a slight favorite even if she were facing a more typical Republican nominee. Instead, it seems she will be facing a nominee who has both defied expectations and created enormous challenges for himself."}
{"text": "After sliding into a banquette at Brasserie Cognac, a French restaurant on Broadway, Eric Ripert didnt even give the lunchtime menu a glance.I want cheese souffl, steak au poivre and tarte Tatin, he told Jolie White, the general manager. He asked for the steak cooked rare. He decided the meal deserved a glass of red wine.Voil, Ms. White said with a brisk nod of affirmation. Classic.Mr. Ripert, 51, works a few blocks away as the chef at Le Bernardin, the holy seafood sanctuary that has been viewed for decades as a gold standard of culinary exquisiteness. (Since its debut in 1986, the restaurant has received four stars from The New York Times all five times it has been reviewed. Mr. Ripert landed there in 1991.) When he wants to come home to classic bistro fare, though, he often heads to this far more everyday place.To me, theres something magical about souffl, he said. To this day, when I see a souffl rising, Im mesmerized. Im just like a kid again.On the surface, it may look like an exercise in gauzy Gallic nostalgia, but anyone who dips into Mr. Riperts forthcoming memoir, 32 Yolks, will realize that just like a kid again is a very complicated phrase for Mr. Ripert.His formative years in France and Andorra were marked by a fair share of misery. His parents split; his dashing and beloved father died of a heart attack when Eric was 11; and his stepfather, whom he refers to by the pseudonym Hugo, seemed to delight in dishing out an endless array of torment.He was a parasite, Mr. Ripert said. It was a disaster for the family. He basically destroyed our life. (With Mr. Riperts encouragement, his mother eventually kicked Hugo out of the house.)For a while, Mr. Ripert, lonely and angry, was shipped to a boarding school, where he says he fended off the advances of a predatory former priest, and his early forays into the hospitality business included mishaps both comic (a Marx Brothers-style spilling incident in culinary school) and agonizing (a Martin Scorsese-style body-scalding in the kitchen at La Tour dArgent in Paris).Mr. Ripert has been a prominent figure in New York City since 1991, but fans of his cooking, and even his closest friends, have remained unaware of his youthful pain.I had no idea, said Anthony Bourdain, who has spent countless hours talking and traveling with Mr. Ripert. The chef has always struck him as a happy and balanced person, prone to neither the neurosis nor the self-sabotage that would hint at the presence of hidden scars.I knew it wasnt a happy childhood, but I had no idea how dark, Mr. Bourdain said. You just dont see evidence of that darkness. He compared 32 Yolks to a Dickens novel. I was absolutely, as the Brits say, gobsmacked, he said. I read it in one sitting.In the book, composed in collaboration with the author Veronica Chambers, who met with Mr. Ripert for scores of conversations in a private room at Le Bernardin, food serves as a frequent source of comfort and an occasional arena of agony.There are the elaborate, nourishing meals prepared at home by his mother, Monique. My mother worked six days a week at her boutique, but she cooked like a Michelin-starred chef every single night, Mr. Ripert writes.And there are lessons in the soul of cooking from men like Jacques Quillacq, a stocky and temperamental chef in Andorra who befriended the young Eric after the death of his father, and Georges Desbouges, a gentleman farmer in Gascony who took Mr. Ripert under his wing (and taught him about meat and smoke and country fare) just before Mr. Ripert moved to the United States and began to make a name for himself.But there are also brutal tours of duty in the kitchens of La Tour dArgent and Jamin, the three-Michelin-star atelier where the chef Jol Robuchon ruled, according to 32 Yolks, like the nit-picking, trip-wired Darth Vader of degustation.Everyone dealt with the pressure differently, Mr. Ripert writes of his comrades at Jamin. Some guys shook all the time. Some went downstairs and cried in the stairwell. I saw a few guys punch the walls. Some guys suffered crippling anxiety attacks.Over lunch, Mr. Ripert said he still endures a recurring nightmare about Mr. Robuchon. The dream happens every two or three months, still, Mr. Ripert said. I fail in America in my career, and I go back to work for him.(In a response for this article, Mr. Robuchon wrote in an email, Let me be clear, I am very demanding with my team, almost as much as with myself, but I condemn violence in any form whatsoever. He said that the book described a high-pressure period when Jamin was trying to win its third Michelin star, and that in the years since, he had become more flexible. He described Mr. Ripert as a friend with whom he regularly keeps in touch.)Mr. Riperts book is also full of passages of mystical beauty and raw emotion, including a heartbreaking scene in which the young Eric experiences a visitation from his dead fathers spirit and finds a moment to say goodbye. In spite of all the rich material, though, an editor at Random House had to pursue Mr. Ripert relentlessly, for years, to persuade him to do the book.He resisted for the same reason that his close friends knew next to nothing about his childhood: He is not wired to spill or to linger in the past. Im very much in the present, and I never go back in time, he said.All of the experiences chronicled in 32 Yolks, both bright and dark, feed into Mr. Riperts work at Le Bernardin. He strives to run his kitchen the kind way, the compassionate way, as a sharp break from the reign-of-terror, chef-is-God approach embedded in centuries of French tradition.You can achieve the exact same results, he said. But going the kind way is a much longer process. If you get kicked in the butt, you learn immediately.In his culinary aesthetic, the discipline and precision that he absorbed from Mr. Robuchon are paired with a deep love of home cooking and a rustic honesty that Mr. Ripert picked up along the way.The power of the flavors  that comes from soul food, he said. Without such roots, he added, your food stays pretty and superficial.Much of what he cooks, and eats, is tangled in the memories that he explores in 32 Yolks. The cheese souffl at Brasserie Cognac reminded him of his mothers crab souffl.Everything is in this souffl, for me, he said. It warms your body. It warms your soul at the same time. His mothers rendition was so delicate that it defied being made in volume.It was my big frustration not to be able to do the crab souffl at Le Bernardin, he said. As a child, he was (in his own words) something of a glutton, and his appetite has never really waned. I dont eat for memory, he said. I eat because I love what Im going to eat, and then it brings the memory.Mr. Riperts appetite for comfort food and memories was in evidence over lunch, where he inhaled all but a few scraps of his colossal repast. When it comes to food, he feels no impulse to hold back.Why would I? he said. I cannot eat and think about restriction. When I eat, I eat. I do not understand the idea of guilty pleasure. Its all about pleasure."}
{"text": "In Levantine landscapes, history is piled high. The present is layered on the remnants of the past, both modern and ancient.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Lebanons capital, Beirut. Sparkling buildings and sweeping urban highways rise up out of heaps of rubble that remain a quarter-century after the 1975-1990 civil war. Yet the crumbling edifices of earlier eras are also, amazingly, still inhabited.Beirut is an organic museum, vibrant and wretched. Pain and hope coexist on its overflowing, labyrinthine streets, and on sinuous coastal roads, shameless wealth lies alongside desperate poverty. A struggling middle class is caught in between. But neither rich nor poor can escape the stench from mounds of uncollected refuse, the evidence of the countrys infamous trash crisis.Metaphors involving unwanted detritus have been irresistible to commentators as Lebanon again finds itself in the crossfire of geopolitical conflict. The regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia has found a new focal point in Lebanon with its uneasy equilibrium.At the center of the crisis is the growing role of Hezbollah, the Shiite political party and militia. Beyond its Lebanese strongholds, the group has also become one of Irans main strategic assets in the region: Heavily supported by Hezbollah fighters, the Russian-Iranian surge in Syria has swung the momentum of the war back in favor of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.Lebanons own political dynamics have also shifted. Beirut has long been trapped in a Syrian orbit; as the fortunes of the Assad regime have revived, Hezbollahs power in Lebanon has grown. Hezbollah had already angered the Saudis and their Gulf allies by its intervention in Syria and support for Iran. The Shiite group has also stalemated domestic politics by blocking the selection of a new Lebanese president.In January, the Gulf states were deeply affronted when Lebanon declined to support an otherwise unanimous (including even Iraq) Arab League condemnation of a mob attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran after the execution of a dissident Shiite cleric in Saudi Arabia. This snub from Beirut convinced them that thanks to Hezbollahs rise, Lebanon was now in Tehrans pocket. Warnings to the Gulf states Lebanese allies that Hezbollahs influence needed curbing seemed to go unheeded; in practice, though, those factions have little alternative but to deal with Hezbollah as usual.Worse, from the Saudi perspective, Hezbollah has started operating not just beyond Lebanon but in the kingdoms back yard. The Saudis see Hezbollahs hand, as well as Tehrans, behind the Houthi rebels in Yemen. This caps a history of accusations of Hezbollah subversion in the Gulf.Yemen was the last straw for Riyadh, which axed $4 billion in support for Lebanons military and intelligence services. The Gulf states also declared Hezbollah a terrorist group and outlawed support for it.Punitive expulsions of Lebanese expatriates from the Gulf, which is suffering its own economic problems from the collapse in oil prices, have left Lebanon reeling from the loss of remittances. Travel warnings from the Gulf governments have also damaged Lebanons tourism industry.Other sectors of the Lebanese economy long supported by Gulf financing, like media outlets, have been hard-hit, too. The financial crisis is palpable and widespread, so that the stinking piles of garbage and wandering bands of desperate Syrian refugees in Beirut may be harbingers of a deeper malady.The drying up of Gulf funds now threatens the foreign exchange flows on which Lebanons banks depend. The remaining reserves are rapidly depleting, which in turn imperils another backbone of the national economy, Lebanons financial services industry.The Gulf states cutting off aid to their Lebanese allies  an incongruous grouping of Sunni, Druze and Christian factions whose only common ground is a shared fear of Hezbollah  undoubtedly cedes the field to Iran. But as a senior Gulf diplomat told me, Our money in Lebanon just didnt stretch as far as Irans. It did not have the same political impact because most Gulf aid went to national institutions like the army, while Irans mainly goes directly to a proxy militia: Hezbollah. With the growing power of Hezbollah, the Gulf states felt that, by underwriting Lebanons national institutions, they were subsidizing what were becoming, in effect, Iranian assets.The key to Lebanons relative stability, as the veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt told me, is that its security services are able to work with the Syrians, the Saudis, the Iranians and the West simultaneously. If that balance is lost, Lebanons fragile equilibrium may collapse.Worse, with proxy conflicts raging in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, Lebanon, too, is a potential battleground for indirect Iranian-Saudi hostilities. So far, the countrys competing factions have united to quarantine the spillover of the Syrian war to a remote part of northern Lebanon. But should Tehran or Riyadh authorize a new theater of confrontation, Lebanon is a potential powder keg.The Gulf states have made their point. But unless they resume their engagement with Lebanon, then, as the Obama administration has warned, Tehrans control can only grow.The international community must shore up Lebanons economy and help it cope with the staggering Syrian refugee crisis. Washington should use its ties to Riyadh and newfound leverage with Tehran to persuade both that stability in Lebanon is in their interest: All have a stake in stopping the Syrian conflict from expanding into Lebanon and preventing the Islamic State from radicalizing local Sunnis. As a first step, they should ensure Lebanon at last gets a new president.The country is poised, in a way familiar to the Lebanese, between tense calm and a potential conflagration. But the pressures are rapidly mounting, and outside actors will have a decisive role in determining whether the country can avoid being sucked into the inferno raging around it."}

{"text": "The N.H.L. suspended Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Kris Letang for one game for an illegal hit on Washington Capitals forward Marcus Johansson.Letang will miss Game 4 of the teams Stanley Cup playoffs series on Wednesday night.The N.H.L.s Department of Player Safety ruled that Letang had made significant head contact with Johansson well after Johansson had released the puck during a sequence in Pittsburghs 3-2 victory on Monday night in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series.Johansson was carrying the puck into the Pittsburgh zone when he made a pass to the boards as four Penguins converged on him. Letang drilled Johansson in the upper body. Johansson briefly left the game.Letang received a minor penalty for interference after the play and was issued the suspension after a brief hearing on Tuesday.The league pointed out that because Johansson was not in possession of the puck, he was not eligible to be checked on the play. The N.H.L. stopped short, however, of describing the hit as charging, which could have carried stiffer discipline.Letang did leave his feet while finishing the check, but the league attributed that to the force of the collision. The N.H.L. also said the head was not the main point of contact.Johansson went through the N.H.L.s concussion protocol before returning to the game, although he did complain of some neck pain after the game. The Capitals trail, two games to one, in the best-of-seven series.Washington held Johansson out of practice Tuesday, and he will be evaluated on Wednesday, Coach Barry Trotz said.Letang said he had no intention of hurting Johansson.I saw him coming full speed, Letang said.

Panels on a nearby pedestrian bridge that were damaged are being replaced.The latest erasure is occurring along the main wall of an east-west underground gallery that links Santiago Calatravas transportation hub to Battery Park City.Much of the wall follows the footprint of the original 1 World Trade Center, the first building to be hit by a hijacked jetliner during the attack. The footprint also defines the edge of the National September 11 Memorials north pool, which is about 25 feet behind the gallery wall.Until mid-March, the wall was a vast expanse of unadorned white marble. Pedestrians might not have understood its implicit symbolism. Yet its spartan solemnity seemed to acknowledge the power of what stood behind it.Now, a gigantic electronic billboard is taking over the wall.Gigantic. As long as the spire of nearby Trinity Church is high: 280 feet. Nine and a half feet tall. With an LED display operating at all hours. Sometimes it will be kinetic; sometimes static. Mercifully, it will always be silent.The billboard is part of Westfield World Trade Center, a luxury shopping mall that is to open in August in the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.The heart of the mall is Mr. Calatravas birdlike Oculus. Its underground limbs include the east-west gallery.Because the gallery opened to the public in 2013, well before retail tenants had set up shop, there have been years to appreciate it without any commercial veneer.But it was never intended to stay that way, the operators of Westfield World Trade Center said.The digital signage network throughout the facility has always been part of the retail program, the Westfield Corporation said in a statement. The goal is to integrate physical and digital experiences across the facility.As for the 280-foot-long sign, the Westfield statement said, The objective is to create moments of interest for those passing through the east-west gallery.How can the public reflect on history looking at a wall ablaze with advertising, store promotions, and arts, culture, news and information programs?Isnt that disrespectful? Westfield does not think so.Westfield is a partner of the September 11 Memorial and Museum foundation and has deep respect for the site and its history, the company said in its statement. There will be no digital media (no screens or other signage) facing the memorial and Westfield has been and will remain sensitive to the memorial.And yet.At street level, the footprints of the original trade center towers are treated reverently. They define the edges of the memorials twin pools. They are the frames around which the names of victims are inscribed.At bedrock level, they are treated respectfully. Clad in shimmering aluminum, the footprints help visitors to the National September 11 Memorial Museum orient themselves and understand where the buildings stood.In the gallery between those levels, however, one edge of the 1 World Trade Center footprint will now be the backdrop for a high-energy marketing device.Mr. Calatravas renderings of the hub do not show any advertising on the scale of the billboard. Though he has said nothing publicly, it would be hard to imagine that he is not frustrated by Westfields plans for signage.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built the gallery, cares principally that the billboard not show explicit political or sexual material. (The two are frequently confused.) The agency can veto content, Westfield said, but that issue is not expected to arise.The nonprofit National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation does not object to the billboard. In fact, the foundation said it may collaborate with Westfield on the content shown on digital screens elsewhere in the hub during the annual commemorative period in September.Somewhere under all that content, something real will have been lost."}
{"text": "I AM PAN!Written and illustrated by Mordicai Gerstein46 pp. Roaring Brook Press. $18.99. (Picture book; ages 5 to 9)The great author-illustrator Mordicai Gerstein, who won a Caldecott Medal in 2004 for The Man Who Walked Between the Towers, often gravitates to myths, legends and folktales, adding his own frisky touch while mining their timeless human dimensions. His newest book, I Am Pan!, is as exuberant as youd expect, and may even have some deep life lessons buried in it. Certainly, young readers or listeners will finish the book with a better understanding of Greek mythology, which these days seems an indispensable feature of kid culture. But mainly its pure unadulterated fun without for one moment being pandering  the kind of book called for when, say, a sluggish mood has descended upon story time, and youre the one in the readers seat. With an energetic style that seems to owe as much to Old Hollywood as to modern graphic novels, Gerstein celebrates the often overlooked god of sheep, shepherds, noise and confusion as an irrepressible character without a shred of self-doubt, who brought a bit of needed levity to a family that took itself very seriously indeed.Gerstein creates a cinematic scope for Pans story before the title page has even appeared, as were introduced to the ancient Greek setting and cast of characters  Zeus and Hera along with a handful of the more charismatic gods and goddesses of Olympus. In bursts Pan, who turns out to be our narrator. He seems determined to steal every possible glimmer of spotlight. Furry-legged and cloven-hoofed, hes got curling rams horns on his head but big human hands stretched out as if he wants to hug the entire world.The illustrations, a vibrant mixture of furiously loose pen-and-ink lines and dabs of rainbow-bright color, are laid out in boxes that often partition the pages, comics style  or, perhaps, in the style of movie storyboards. The effect is to heighten the sense of storytelling rooted in the visual (though with the ever verbally agile Gerstein, as much as his illustrations seem to be whats taking you places, the words are never an afterthought). As Pan tells of being born to a human-seeming mother and her husband, Hermes, the messenger god, the slapstick comedy begins: The midwife is horrified by the babys appearance and flees the premises, but Hermes is so excited he flew right through the roof to tell Papa Zeus the news. We see red roof tiles flying about as the golden-hued god leaps out into the sky on the way to Olympus.Pan gambols his way through several more stories, surviving war, heartbreak and vicious Mount Olympus gossip. Gerstein ends with a wonderful gag about Pans death, centuries after his peak years, when people sailed new seas, fought new wars, and worshiped new gods. Pan claims he announced his own death, just so he and the rest of the gods could retire in peace, free from all the responsibility. He leaves us with a parting reminder that he still likes to incite a little chaos now and then  but when you sense a mood of confusion approaching, dont panic! Were reminded, not for the first time in the book, that the word itself derives from the mischievous gods name  another way that learning Greek mythology from a book like this is, perhaps in spite of Gersteins best effort at subversive frivolity, eminently useful."}
{"text": "For a guy at the center of an international diplomatic incident, Jan Bhmermann is pretty self-effacing and modest. Funny, for sure, since comedy and satire are his profession. But also thoughtful and intellectual, as well as bemused that a performance on his weekly TV show has triggered a court case and raised the ire of Turkeys leader.Mr. Bhmermann, who met with the editorial board on Tuesday, is the German comedian who caused a ruckus in March by reading a crude poem intended to offend Turkeys incredibly thin-skinned president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Mr. Erdogan, an autocrat who is doing his best to crush free speech in his own country and beyond, responded by formally demanding that the comic be punished under an obscure 19thcentury German law that allows prosecution for insulting a foreign leader.The legal complaint seems to be having its intended chilling effect. Mr. Bhmermann said that as he returns to his show on May 12 after a hiatus of several weeks, he will be more cautious. Knowing the prosecution hangs over him, Im actually not allowed to say anything about the Turkish president, he said, adding: Im not as free, as you can imagine. I go on stage and I have to think about what I can say.What few would have predicted is that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a democracy where free speech is supposed to be a cherished right, allowed the case to proceed. It would not have gone forward if she mustered the courage and good sense to say no.Instead, she unwisely chose to indulge Mr. Erdogan because she needs his help in stemming another potentially overwhelming and destabilizing flow of refugees to Europe this year.We were completely surprised at the response of the chancellor, Mr. Bhmermann said. When he and his team were putting together the segment on Erdogan, no one even knew about the obscure law he is now being investigated for violating.The poem was intended to be edgy but it was more like an illustration of an insult than an actual insult, intended to show the German public what satire is and what is allowed and what is not allowed in Germany. He added, we didnt think about it too much.There are ironies in this story. One is that Mr. Erdogan used poetry to make a political point in 1997when he was a rising Islamist-leaning politician and was jailed for four months by the countrys military and secular leaders. The other is that Mrs. Merkel has a reputation as a human rights defender and was even among the world leaders who gathered in Paris last year to show solidarity with the French people after the deadly attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine.Mr. Bhmermann called Mrs. Merkels contradictory reactions quite strange, especially since we are not Charlie Hebdo. We dont make fun of religion at all.He also finds her sense of humor lacking. Unlike President Obama who is the greatest comedian in the world, he said, Ive never heard Angela Merkel telling a joke and I cant even imagine her being like funny in a natural way.Mr. Bhmermann expects to present his side of the story to prosecutors soon. He said he has great confidence in the German judicial system and is pretty confident that they will deal with it in a just way. The only just conclusion is to discard Mr. Erdogans spurious complaint and repeal the anti-democratic law.In parting, Mr. Bhmermann offered some thoughts on the problems with being a German comic, reproduced below:Jan Bhmermann: We proved that we are a complete humorless nation. [] I think its because of our language. [] In English you can make a joke and you dontyou dont ah, give away the punchline during the setup. But our language is so complicated that you always give away the punchlineduring the setup, because we like, put the verbs its so, its strange, it really is strange. Yeah. It is, it really is.Q: The location of the verb is a problem.Jan Bhmermann: Yeah, the location of the verb. Put it at the end. You dont know what a German wants to say to you until you get to the end. Very rude, or very nice, but you haveits always nerve-wracking toyou know, its tough, it really is tough toits actually no joke. Its tough tobe funny in German."}

Neither gravitational waves nor black holes  both predictions of Einsteins theory of gravity, general relativity  had been seen directly before.It was also a good day for the researchers, for whom great honors were immediately predicted. Now those predictions are coming true. On Tuesday, Yuri Milner, a Russian Internet entrepreneur and philanthropist, announced that he was giving $3 million to the gravitational-wave discoverers. The award is a special addition to the $3 million Breakthrough Prizes in Fundamental Physics he awards every fall.The three ringleaders of the gravitational-wave experiment, known as LIGO, Ronald P. Drever and Kip. S. Thorne of the California Institute of Technology, and Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will split $1 million. The other $2 million will be split among 1,012 scientists who were authors of the  article in Physical Review Letters, or who made major contributions to the study of gravitational waves."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada grabbed international headlines recently with a simple explanation of a cutting-edge technology called quantum computing. Now IBM is trying to do something similar by making a research-oriented quantum computer and a  relatively  simple tutorial available online for anyone to try.The possibilities of a new class of computers that are able to exploit the most basic properties of energy and matter to speed calculations beyond what is possible with todays digital systems has long held both promise and controversy. The systems are based on the notion of a qubit, or quantum bit  a basic value capable of encompassing more information than the 1s and 0s that are the basis of classical digital computing.A computing system composed of just five qubits, which is what IBM built, would not be able to replace current personal computers. However, the IBM Quantum Experience will allow students, hobbyists and even serious researchers to experiment with algorithms that are radically different from the ones now used for everything from word processing to speech recognition.Its meant to be educational, but also to be the beginnings of a larger framework, said Jerry M. Chow, manager of the Experimental Quantum Computing Group at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.IBM researchers have recently demonstrated a quantum computer that they believe will one day be scaled up to a machine that might have hundreds of qubits and be able to run a wide range of algorithms more quickly than todays computers.Some quantum computing theorists believe that such a computer one day might be designed as a universal computer capable of performing any task much faster than machines now in use.IBM has been gradually enhancing the power of its quantum computer, which is assembled from a network of qubits made from metals that become superconducting when they are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero.Researchers at the company announced the construction of a four-bit quantum computer last year and in February reported they added a fifth qubit and were making progress in refining certain error-correcting methods that are important for quantum computing.The IBM quantum computer will offer visually oriented online tutorials that are intended to help people and companies understand how programming such a computer will be different from programming a digital computer. In addition to visual simulations of quantum computing, it will include a gamelike system that will parcel out access to the actual quantum computer for online users.The idea of computers that might exploit the spooky laws of quantum behavior that describe nature at an atomic level was first broached by the physicist Richard Feynman in 1981. Since then, scientists have proposed specialized algorithms that might allow quantum computers to break computer codes or even simulate complex biological processes.The IBM simulator is not the first quantum computing simulator available online. For example, in 2014 Google engineers made available the Quantum Computing Playground that allows online users to play with a simulated quantum computer with between six and 22 qubits."}

{"text": "MADRID  King Felipe VI of Spain signed a decree on Tuesday to dissolve Parliament and hold a rerun of national elections for the first time since the countrys return to democracy in the late 1970s.The step followed months of political paralysis and discord over who should form a government after inconclusive elections in December. That election resulted in a fracturing of Spains political landscape with the emergence of insurgent parties that challenged the establishment, marking a sea change in the nations politics.The repeat election is now scheduled for June 26, but opinion polls suggest that the outcome of a new vote could look much like the first, which split ballots among four main parties, with no single one close to a majority.Turnout, however, could fall amid growing frustration about the intense but fruitless party squabbling.Whatever the outcome in late June, Patxi Lpez, the Socialist president of the lower house of Parliament, called on Tuesday for an electoral overhaul to tighten future deadlines for forming a government and to ensure that Spain does not spend so much time again in political limbo. He also urged party leaders to draw lessons now from their failure to break the deadlock since December.We havent managed to fulfill the citizens mandate, Mr. Lpez told a news conference after meeting the king on Tuesday morning. I hope that these four months have served to understand a few things.The repeat of elections was virtually guaranteed a week ago, when Felipes final round of consultations with party leaders ended in failure.Since then, the party leaders have instead opened a new round of mutual recriminations over who should be held responsible for leaving Spain without an elected government at a time of economic, social and political challenges.Spains unemployment rate rose again slightly in the first quarter, to about 21 percent, according to figures released last week by the National Statistics Institute.On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also warned Spain about its budget deficit and soaring debt, as well as unemployment, even as the countrys economy continues to recover at about twice the growth rate of most other European nations.Without additional budgetary tightening, Spain will most likely fail to meet its European obligation to lower its deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product until 2018, according to the European Commissions latest forecast.The financial crisis exposed growing economic imbalances in Spain and also brought to the surface several corruption scandals involving kickbacks, mostly from the construction industry, paid to politicians from established parties during a property boom, which collapsed in 2008.Such scandals helped two emerging parties challenge the traditional two-party system and alternation of power between the conservative Popular Party of Mariano Rajoy, the caretaker prime minister, and the main opposition Socialist party.But after the Dec. 20 elections, the two newcomers  the center-right Ciudadanos and the far-left Podemos  also ended up in an acrimonious standoff that played a significant part in the overall deadlock that stalled forming a coalition government.The latest polls indicate that the Popular Party will once more win the most votes in June, but not enough to regain the parliamentary majority that it had until Decembers elections.Even though Mr. Rajoys party recently got entangled in more corruption scandals, particularly in the eastern region of Valencia, it could benefit from a low turnout, as the conservative electorate is seen as a more disciplined force when it comes to voting.In fact, after turning down the kings offer to try to form a coalition government in January, Mr. Rajoy has largely stayed on the sidelines of the negotiations  as well as the debating in Parliament. He and his ministers have refused to appear before lawmakers, while openly questioning the legitimacy of an assembly that did not elect the government and was in any case likely to be short-lived.Since the elections, Spains main party leaders have not only failed to form a coalition government but have also struggled to maintain their party stewardship.In fact, all the main parties except Ciudadanos face internal divisions that they will try to contain ahead of the vote, Antonio Barroso, a Spanish political analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, said in a recent analysis.The turmoil in Spain comes as politicians in the northeastern region of Catalonia are forging ahead with plans to secede from the rest of the country.The Spanish vote could also be affected by Britains referendum on whether to leave the European Union, scheduled for June 23, just three days before Spains new election, according to Antonio Roldn, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos.Should British voters decide to leave the European Union, the shock waves would be felt across the 28-nation bloc, but perhaps particularly in countries like Spain that already face fiscal challenges and that were on the front line of the euro debt crisis, he said.If Britain exits the bloc, the countries on the periphery will look particularly vulnerable, and Spain will stand out as the only country without a government as well as a large deficit hole, Mr. Roldn said. This will be a very fragile situation."}
{"text": "Its the rare wine list that can be all things to all people. Only the most well-financed restaurants have the resources to range freely the world over and present the best of the best. Instead, most wine-conscious restaurants narrow their visions and choose a style or region in which to concentrate.The selection must complement the cooking. And, ideally, it must convey something significant about the restaurants identity and aspirations.Im thinking, for example, of the wine list at Marta, which reels you in both with its counterintuitive emphasis on Champagne  With pizza? Really?  and with its pricing, which distinguishes it as among the least marked-up Champagne lists in New York. It offers a wide selection of Italian wines as well.Another restaurant, Wildair, offers a hard-core list of wines grown and made naturally. Within that stylistic realm, which speaks to the wine director Jorge Rieras passionate belief in the beauty of these wines, Wildair offers a wide variety of grapes from different regions.Allow me to go a step beyond these quirky, focused lists and present Freeks Mill, a new casual restaurant in Gowanus, Brooklyn, which has one of the deepest, most narrowly concentrated selections Ive seen. You say youve been yearning for a nice glass of pinot grigio? Forget about it. You may as well be ordering a hamburger in the old Saturday Night Live cheeseburger skit.If you want Beaujolais or a chenin blanc from the Loire Valley, though, Freeks Mill is the place to be. Of roughly 200 bottles on the list, about 70 of them are chenin blancs from various Loire appellations, and another 65 are Beaujolais, almost entirely from the 10 Beaujolais crus, the best parts of the region.You have a few other options. Freeks Mill has pulled together nice selections of wines from the country of Georgia, all made in the ancient way of using indigenous grapes like kisi and rkatsiteli, and fermenting and aging them in terra-cotta qvevris, amphora-like vats buried in the cool earth. These wines can be stunningly delicious, but they are to the proverbial pinot grigio what the traditional polyphonic choral music of Georgia is to a commercial ditty.Freeks Mills list was constructed by Alex Alan, the sommelier and a partner in the restaurant, which opened in early April. In putting it together, he lands Freeks Mill squarely in the middle of an age-old debate: Is a restaurant obliged to give customers what they want by offering something for everybody? Or can it stay true to a vision, no matter how narrow, uncompromising or esoteric?Mr. Alan said his choices were not originally philosophical, but instead grew out of a draft of the restaurants opening menu, which emphasized seasonal vegetables, small plates and a wood-burning oven.I put it all together in my head based on the flavors and how they worked, he said. As it turned out, I have a lot of Beaujolais and chenin blanc in my house. Its what I like to drink.Knowing that Freeks Mill was on a quiet block of Gowanus, where the prominent local landmarks include a coffin wholesaler and a shuffleboard theme bar, Mr. Alan pondered whether obsession might have its advantages.I started thinking that no one was going to come out to Gowanus unless I go all the way down the rabbit hole with these two regions, he said. Id provide something else if people arent interested, but thats just a pressure-release valve.Even with such a concentration in two regions, Mr. Alan insists that customers have plenty of variety from which to choose. From the Loire, chenin blancs come from Vouvray and Savennires, Montlouis and Jasnires, Anjou, Touraine and Saumur. The various appellations offer a multitude of terroirs, and its a fascinating opportunity to compare different expressions of the same grape.I think chenin plays in an amazing variety of sites, from light, lean Montlouis to rich Savennires, Mr. Alan said. Even if the flavor profile has something in common, I would say you have more variety between Montlouis and Savennires than anywhere in the world.In Beaujolais, too, Mr. Alan sees a wide spectrum of expressions between, say, the light fruitiness of Brouilly and the denser, more textured wines in Morgon.In a perfect world, I want to give customers what they want, Mr. Alan said. But I also want to teach them something without it feeling like Im teaching them something.Nobody has complained yet about the narrowness of the list, he said. But if people do, Mr. Alans safety-valve selections may not offer a comfortable landing. Among the 13 whites labeled Not Chenin Blanc, he offers a 2014 Pazo de Seorans Albario for $50 and a 2014 Pattes Loup Chablis for $75, but also a Hungarian juhfark for $55 and four vintages of a blend of obaideh and merwah from the legendary Lebanese producer Chateau Musar. These wonderful age-worthy wines will set you back $115 to $350 a bottle, depending on how old a bottle you select.Hopefully, theres enough there, Mr. Alan said. If you want to stick to your guns, Im going to offer it to you. But its top tier.Prices for Beaujolais run for $40 for a 2015 Jean Foillard Beaujolais Nouveau, one of four non-cru selections, up to $100 for a 2014 Lapalu Brouilly Cuve des Fous, a rare bottling made from vines over 100 years old that is gorgeously vivid. Freeks, by the way, is a nontipping restaurant, so list prices have an extra percentage figured in.I applaud Mr. Alan for going all in on his list. For the most part, he has chosen wonderful wines that will reward consumers who put themselves in his hands. And, honestly, Beaujolais and Loire chenin blancs are distinctive and delicious but well within any notion of what constitutes the mainstream.For truly adventurous palates, I highly recommend exploring the selection of Georgian wines. They are unusual, particularly the amber wines, whites that are made like reds. Instead of removing the pigment-bearing skins from the grape juice, as is the case with conventional white wines, the skins are left to macerate with the juices, giving the wines an amber cast and a tannic rasp that is rare in a white. They feel great in the mouth, and the tannins give the wine an extra bit of heft. As a group, these are honest, authentic, delicious expressions made by small farmers.Though the lists bandwidth may seem narrow, the opportunity for pleasure is great. If you just cant live without Bordeaux or pinot grigio, however, a few thousand other restaurants in New York will have what you want."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Justice Department took steps Tuesday to restore the access of some government watchdogs to sensitive internal records, but officials called on Congress to enact a permanent, wider fix.The inspector general offices for 72 agencies across the federal government charged that legal policy changes made by the Obama administration over the last several years had curtailed their access to records, harmed a wide range of investigations and compromised their independence.At least 20 investigations into topics such as sexual abuse at the Peace Corps and fatal shootings by the Drug Enforcement Administration were slowed, hindered, or sometimes closed as a result of the changes, the inspectors general said.Justice Department officials said Tuesday that a new directive and an accompanying legal opinion would address some of those concerns.In a memo dated Monday, Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates said that responding to investigations by the Justice Departments inspector general is of the highest priority for the department, and she directed officials to provide timely access to all the material requested.That includes grand jury documents, wiretapping records and other confidential materials that a controversial Justice Department legal opinion last year concluded could be withheld in some circumstances. Ms. Yatess memo was first reported by The Associated Press.In December, a congressional spending bill signed by President Obama threatened to cut off funding if records were improperly withheld from the inspectors general for the Justice Department and five others covered by the bill: the Commerce Department, NASA, the National Science Foundation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Legal Service Corporation.A legal opinion last week by the Justice Departments office of legal counsel  replacing the one that came out last year  said that because of that funding measure, all material must now be turned over to those watchdogs through the end of the fiscal year in September.In a telephone interview, Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Departments inspector general and leader of the governmentwide association of inspectors general, said it was unfortunate that it had taken the threat of a cutoff in funding by Congress for his office to see its full access to investigative records restored for now.The I.G.s have a right to access these documents  period, he said.He urged Congress to act on a proposal that would ensure permanent access for all 72 inspectors general  not just those covered by the funding measure through September.Justice Department officials said they, too, welcomed congressional action to clear up what they said were ambiguities in the law."}

Bumper cars designed like genitalia? Check. Snack bar serving aphrodisiac recipes? Check. Sex on the premises? Uh, better not.Entrepreneurs in Brazil are seeking to build an adults-only theme park called ErotikaLand near the city of Piracicaba, about two hours drive from So Paulo, and they hope to open its doors by 2018. But the project is setting off debate over public displays of sexuality in Brazil, where Carnival celebrations feature scantily clad dancers and thousands of short-stay love motels strive to please an exacting clientele.We cannot be known as the capital of sex, Matheus Erler, a member of the Christian Socialist Party who leads the Piracicaba City Council, told reporters. He said he was worried that the park would attract debauched individuals.The businessman in charge of the project, Mauro Morata, tried to ease some local concerns when he made clear that the park would be built outside the city limits. Still, municipal leaders in Piracicaba and nearby So Pedro have maneuvered to block the project. Mr. Morata says he is pressing ahead anyway with his search for an acceptable site, and emphasizes the projects economic upsides: 250 new jobs and thousands of visitors who can afford $100 apiece to get in.As for the racy theme, the investors behind ErotikaLand say the park will promote a healthy approach to sex. Parkgoers will be able to tour a museum exploring the history of sexuality, and employees will promote condom use. The park will have a sex playground, but it will feature a labyrinth, Ferris wheel and water slide.What the customers cannot have, the investors say, is any actual intercourse  at least, not in the park.This wont be a place for nuns, but its not like were trying to recreate Sodom and Gomorrah, Mr. Morata said. If attendees want to take things to another level, they can go to a nearby motel  which we will operate."}
{"text": "THURSDAY PUZZLE  One of the fun things about solving crosswords, particularly those of the Thursday variety, is seeing exactly what constructors can get up to with their themes; what kind of ACEs they might have up their sleeves, as it were.Lets break down this tricky puzzle by David Poole and find out :If you have a hidden advantage, as the revealer at 52A says, you have an ACE IN THE HOLE. Today, Mr. Poole uses symmetrical black squares as his holes, and hides four ACEs in them.I realized that something was up right away at 1A, because no way is a cartoon cel made out of TATE. Thats just silly. And its not a rebus, because TATE works with the Down entries. But I do know that a cel that is used in cartooning is made of (ACE)TATE.Now the question is, how do you write that ACE prefix into the grid with only four empty squares? Today, you have two choices. You can remember that the word ACE needs to be inserted either before or after four of the entries, or, if you are solving in print, you can grab a white marker and try to write it into the black squares.Similarly, the only hitch at 24A is that you have just enough room to write in AMAZING GR. But theres that extra black square to the right, just waiting to be used. And sometimes we just have to break the rules and write outside the white boxes. Even if you had never heard of the Broadway show AMAZING GRACE, you might have guessed it based on the part of the clue that calls for a spiritual.Go ahead and see if you can find the other two ACEs. And remember what I said above about symmetry.15A: A few bucks? is a familiar phrase having to do with money, but watch out for that question mark. Things here are not what they seem; what other kinds of bucks do you know? Could it be DEER?21A: Holder of The Sun and The World is classic misdirection. You might think that Mr. Poole is talking about the holding companies of two now-defunct newspapers, but what else holds items called The Sun and The World? In this case, Mr. Poole is thinking about a TAROT deck.6D: European country whose telephone directories list people alphabetically by first name might seem like an unusually cruel trivia question, but dont give up. You can get this by tackling as many of the crossings as possible before you realize that the answer is ICELAND.54D: Places to get the lead out? is a classic mispronunciation clue. It might seem like a weird clue for E.R.S, but if you pronounce it leed, as in a medical lead (as opposed to led as in the chemical element), the clue makes much more sense.This one was tricky for me, but fair. You might not always expect to have to write in the black squares, but it does happen. All is fair in love and crosswords, and youve been warned. Now you know.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "BRUSSELS  The eurozone economy continues its long slog.With growth slowing and the region facing a wide array of challenges  from the long-running Greek debt crisis to the possibility of a British exit from the European Union  the European Commission, the 28-nation blocs executive arm, warned on Tuesday of high risks and substantial uncertainty in the economy.Here are some highlights from the commissions latest forecast:Output in the eurozone, the 19-country currency union, is finally back to levels reached in the early months of 2008, before the financial and debt crises emerged. But a slowdown in China, the European Unions second-largest trading partner behind the United States, makes export growth an uncertain prospect. Low inflation, or even periodic falling prices in the eurozone, has also stoked fears that the region could suffer a lost decade, while many of the Continents people are also grappling with widespread unemployment and falling wages.On Tuesday, the commission lowered its growth estimates for the euro area for this year and next. Gross domestic product is expected to advance 1.6 percent in 2016 and 1.8 percent next year, compared with a previous forecast in February of 1.7 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017. The commission also lowered its forecast for economic growth in the broader European Union, now expected to hit 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017._____There have been signs that the Greek economy has bottomed out, and the commissions assessment is comparatively rosier for the country. In February, the commission forecast that Greeces economy would shrink 0.7 percent this year and grow 2.7 percent in 2017. On Tuesday, it predicted the decline this year would be a less-severe 0.3 percent, and it held firm to its forecast for 2017.Despite those forecasts, there are still challenges. Political instability has made it difficult for Greeces left-wing government to carry out changes needed to improve the climate for business, and there is also the threat that Athens could default on its debts this summer unless it receives more bailout aid. For many Greeks, the economic situation remains dire. Output has fallen by more than a quarter since 2010, around 25 percent of the work force is unemployed, and about half of all bank loans are in default._____A slew of reports have warned that a vote by Britain on June 23 in favor of a departure from the European Union, a so-called Brexit, would have serious economic costs for the country, including a drop in growth and exports. Experts predict a period of uncertainty, particularly over the future of Britains free trade arrangements with the rest of the bloc. British companies currently enjoy automatic access to the European Unions single market. A vote to leave the bloc could also encourage other countries to consider that path, threatening the European Union with fragmentation.In February, the commission predicted that Britain would grow 2.1 percent in 2016, and the same amount next year. Its latest forecasts, however, are sharply lower, with the country now expected to grow only 1.8 percent this year, and 1.9 percent in 2017._____A slowdown in emerging markets has left Germany, the eurozones biggest economy, looking vulnerable. If German manufacturers remain wary and confidence in the economy remains weak, companies may cut back on investment or hiring, pushing growth closer to the lackluster eurozone average of about 1 percent. On Tuesday, the commission cut its forecasts this year and next for Germany by 0.2 of a percentage point, predicting advancement of 1.6 percent in both years.Germany also has significant savings that could be invested in infrastructure projects, providing stimulus to the domestic and wider European economy. But Germany has been reluctant to countenance such spending, and the countrys leaders have been unwilling to allow other European states to run larger deficits. Some economists say that has exacerbated the painful effects of austerity policies enacted over the past six years across the region._____In September, the commissions president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said migration could be an antidote to looming labor woes in Europe, where an aging population threatens economic growth. In its autumn forecast, officials predicted that the three million migrants expected over the next three years would provide at least a small lift  a net gain to the European economy of perhaps a quarter of 1 percent by 2017."}
{"text": "Before she became a neuroscientist, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang was a seventh-grade science teacher at a school outside Boston. One year, during a period of significant racial and ethnic tension at the school, she struggled to engage her students in a unit on human evolution. After days of apathy and outright resistance to Ms. Immordino-Yangs teaching, a student finally asked the question that altered her teaching  and her career path  forever: Why are early hominids always shown with dark skin?With that question, one that connected the abstract concepts of human evolution and the very concrete, personal experiences of racial tension in the school, her students resistance gave way to interest. As she explained the connection between the effects of equatorial sunlight, melanin and skin color and went on to explain how evolutionary change and geography result in various human characteristics, interest blossomed into engagement, and something magical happened: Her students began to learn.Dr. Immordino-Yangs eyes light up as she recounts this story in her office at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California. Now an associate professor of education, psychology and neuroscience, she understands the reason behind her students shift from apathy to engagement and, finally, to deep, meaningful learning.Her students learned because they became emotionally engaged in material that had personal relevance to them.Emotion is essential to learning, Dr. Immordino-Yang said, and should not be underestimated or misunderstood as a trend, or as merely the E in SEL, or social-emotional learning. Emotion is where learning begins, or, as is often the case, where it ends. Put simply, It is literally neurobiologically impossible to think deeply about things that you dont care about, she said.This rule holds true even across subjects and disciplines, Dr. Immordino-Yang writes in her book, Emotions, Learning, and the Brain. Even in academic subjects that are traditionally considered unemotional, such as physics, engineering or math, deep understanding depends on making emotional connections between concepts.As a teacher, I know what an emotionally engaged student looks like on the outside, but Dr. Immordino-Yang showed me what that student looks like on the inside using a functional M.R.I., a scanner that reveals brain function in real time.When students are emotionally engaged, she said, we see activations all around the cortex, in regions involved in cognition, memory and meaning-making, and even all the way down into the brain stem.As she went on to explain why emotion is vital to high-quality learning, Ms. Immordino-Yangs cheeks flushed pink, her eyes brightened, and her hands became animated and expressive. While shed provided me with pages of quotes, studies and images meant to illustrate all she wanted to teach me during those two hours in her office, her enthusiasm for the topic served as the most powerful exhibit.Great teachers understand that the best, most durable learning happens when content sparks interest, when it is relevant to a childs life, and when the students form an emotional bond with either the subject at hand or the teacher in front of them. Meaningful learning happens when teachers are able to create an emotional connection to what might otherwise remain abstract concepts, ideas or skills.Creating this emotional connection might sound like a daunting task, but research has shown that the investment reaps huge dividends in the form of increased learning and better grades. When teachers take the time to learn about their students likes, dislikes and personal interests, whether its racial issues brewing at their school, their after-school job, or their dreams and goals, learning improves.I experienced this a few years ago, with a parent who asked me how to get her daughter interested in school. The girl dreamed of becoming a dairy farmer like her father and grandfather, and felt that her classes were irrelevant.And yet, given a few moments to think and some creativity, we both realized that dairy farming is a perfect laboratory for everything from biology to math, chemistry to geometry, history to government; all of these subjects are relevant and important in the life of a dairy farmer. When the catalog for I.V.F.-ready bull semen arrives in the mail, shell need to know about dominant and recessive genetic traits. Shell need to understand soil chemistry, microbiology, botany, the geometry of herd rotation as it relates to land use, and the political and financial realities of keeping dairy farming viable as an industry.The emotional connection that can result when teachers make learning personally relevant to students is what differentiates superficial, rote, topical assimilation of material from a superlative education marked by deep mastery and durable learning. While there are no silver bullets in education, emotional engagement and personal relevance is the tool that has the potential to improve the educational experience of every child, in every school in America.Jessica Lahey is an educator, writer and speaker and the author of The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed.Interested in more Well Family?

{"text": "At the Pike Place Market in Seattle, its the glistening, freshly caught salmon piled high that youll notice first. The fishmongers are jolly, and sales are brisk.You might think all was well in the world of wild salmon, but youd be wrong. Its actually a wonder that wild salmon is even a possibility in the 21st century, considering the rampant overfishing that made Atlantic salmon, both here and in Europe, nearly extinct.The only Atlantic salmon for sale now is farmed (and it is called Atlantic even if the fish is farmed in Norway or Chile). But inexpensive farmed salmon is a bland, sorry alternative to wild. Artificial dyes and pesticides are often used, and the farms pose environmental hazards.Pacific wild salmon has survived despite great odds, due mostly to careful, often extreme management. Concerted efforts by conservationists have averted its total demise.Fortunately, there is hope for the wild salmon that inhabit Bristol Bay, a relatively pristine fishery off Alaska that so far has remained unharmed and is well managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Bristol Bay residents have depended on salmon for physical and spiritual nourishment for generations.When wild Pacific salmon season opens in late spring along the West Coast, from Alaska all the way down to San Diego, there is reason to celebrate. The years first wild salmon, whether king (also called chinook) or sockeye, has incredibly brilliant red flesh; an exquisite, sweet, mild flavor, and a tender velvetlike texture.I bought a beautiful piece of king salmon the other day. It wasnt cheap at $40 a pound, but it was enough to make four diners extremely happy, and there were no complaints about the four-ounce portion  only moans of pleasure. I let the thin slices cook gently in butter, making sure they were just done, which took no more than four minutes.A spoonful of lightly whipped cream, seasoned in a savory way with salt, pepper, lemon zest and a dab of mustard, was the sauce. (Its a great effortless topping to use for other kinds of delicate fish, too, or for garnishing pured vegetable soups.)We all agreed, for a luxury like wild king salmon, its well worth paying a pretty penny and keeping the preparation perfectly simple.Recipes: Wild King Salmon With Savory Whipped Cream | More Salmon Dishes"}
{"text": "Rafael Nadal easily defeated Andrey Kuznetsov, 6-3, 6-3, on Tuesday to reach the third round of the Madrid Open while Andy Murray advanced with a hard-fought 7-6, 3-6, 6-1 win over Radek Stepanek.Nadal broke Kuznetsovs serve once in the first set and twice in the second to secure the win in his opening match at the event, a clay-court tournament that he has won twice in the last three seasons.The match lasted just 1 hour 18 minutes, during which Nadal had four aces and no double faults as he won his 11th consecutive match. He has not lost since his opening match at the Miami Open in March and is coming off consecutive title wins at the Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open.In the third round, Nadal will face either Sam Querrey or Lucas Pouille, who play each other on Wednesday.Another tournament win in Madrid would allow Nadal to match his total number of titles from last year and would certainly give his confidence a further boost heading into the French Open, which begins at Roland Garros Stadium in three weeks. Nadal last won there in 2014.After struggling last season, Nadal is off to a good start in 2016. He has reached at least the semifinals in six of the eight tournaments he has played, with early eliminations at the Australian Open and at Miami.Im happy with the way I started the clay-court season, Nadal said. Today, another victory, so thats great news. Im excited about this tournament.Nadal dominated on Tuesday by serving extremely well. He needed only eight second serves the entire match and lost only five points on his first. He hit 22 winners and had only nine unforced errors at the Magic Box center court in Madrid.My serve has been solid, Nadal said. I served well both in Monte Carlo and in Barcelona. And its going to be vital to serve well here, as well to have a good tournament.Nadal, who is Spanish, has won the Madrid Open four times, including 2013 and 2014, but he lost the final last year to Murray.The second-ranked Murray battled hard to get past Stepanek, 37, who on Monday had become the oldest player to win a match at a Masters 1000 tournament since Jimmy Connors in 1992.Murray was broken early in the first two sets but came back strongly in the third to close out the match and secure a spot in the next round. He had 11 aces over all, including four in the decisive set.He played very well; it was not easy, Murray said of Stepanek. He was hitting the ball big up the lines. There was nothing I could do.In womens singles, sixth-seeded Simona Halep routed Karin Knapp, 6-1, 6-1, while eighth-seeded Carla Surez Navarro beat Sabine Lisicki, 6-3, 6-2.Dominika Cibulkova lost the first nine games of her match but recovered to defeat Caroline Garcia, 0-6, 6-3, 6-4, and reach the round of 16.Tenth-seeded Timea Bacsinszky beat Ekaterina Makarova, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, and Samantha Stosur advanced to the third round when 11th-seeded Lucie Safarova withdrew because of a stomach virus.FRENCH FEDERATION RAIDED French prosecutors seized documents after carrying out a series of searches at the countrys tennis federation and the home of its president, Jean Gachassin.Frances financial prosecutors office said in a statement that the searches had related to possible misappropriation of property and influence trafficking pertaining to the existence of an illicit system of reselling tickets for the French Open tournament and to the awarding of the contract for the renovation and enlargement of Roland Garros.The searches resulted in the seizure of documents useful to the investigation, the office added.In a brief statement, the tennis federation said it was fully cooperating with the investigators.Havas Voyages La Depeche, a travel agency based in southern France, was also searched as part of the investigation.In February, the French newspaper Le Canard Enchan reported that French Open tickets had been sold to the travel agency for a significant profit."}

{"text": "Silicon Valley is built on precise engineering, data-driven analysis and software as rational as the semiconductors on which it runs.It is also one of the most emotional locations in American business.In this case, were not talking about the irrational exuberance in the management of a company like Zenefits, where greed for growth may have led to regulatory cheating, and greed for fun meant beer kegs at work.There is also the irrationality of glitz and aura and living with fickle consumers, as Brian Chen discusses in his story on Fitbit.Fitbit makes a device that tracks things like steps and sleep from a wearers wrist. Founded in 2007, the company has over 1,000 employees and last year sold 21.3 million devices, almost twice the number of a year earlier.Sound good? It might be, but for the aura accorded to Apple products. For many tech product reviewers and fans, Apples Watch, wrist-worn and capable of doing what Fitbit does, it the standard by which Fitbit falls short.The Apple Watch does more things. The Apple Watch is an Apple product, and those sell well. Fitbit announces a new product and its stock drops, because it is not Apple.Never mind that Fitbits sell for much less, probably to a different audience, or that Apples last quarter showed declining sales. While Apple is quick to trumpet its sales triumphs, after a full year it still hasnt given numbers on Watch sales. (Estimates are that it sold 12 million, but with unknown profitability, partly because of the huge marketing put behind Apple Watch.)The real problem the company seems to be struggling with is that it is not Apple, which basks in an aura of cool design excellence and unbeatable success.Fitbit is a single-purpose device, unlike the multipurpose iPhone or Watch, but thats been true for years, and Fitbit keeps increasing sales. It may be that there is room in the world for both things.On the other hand, that may be too rational a view for the tech world and its investors."}
{"text": "I have Parkinsons disease  at least, I think I do. I have a slight tremor in my right hand, my posture is becoming more stooped and I have a diminished sense of smell. I have not spoken about this with a physician. I have discussed it with a couple of other people who have the disease.Im 70 years old, and I have decided to apply for long-term-care insurance. If I am correct about my Parkinsons, I am statistically at much higher risk of needing long-term care than the average insurance applicant. I have answered all the questions on the insurance application honestly. One of the questions begins, Have you consulted a physician regarding any of the following conditions, and it lists many illnesses, including Parkinsons. Well, I have not consulted any physician about my condition. And I dont think I will until the symptoms become strong enough that I require the use of pharmaceuticals to help me manage.Must I make a special effort to inform the insurance company about my suspicions? It will probably affect my eligibility or increase my premiums. Or am I just another point in their actuarial tables? A lot of people get insurance and subsequently discover a condition that needs long-term care. Name WithheldInsurance is about sharing risk. Among people with homeowners insurance, say, many will pay more in premiums than they will ever collect. Others  those whose homes burn down  will collect more than theyll ever pay. Both groups have the confidence that a mishap wont wipe them out financially. And the reason insurers stay in business is that people are better at predicting aggregate risk (How many of our homes will burn down?) than individual risk (Which of our homes will burn down?).Because insurance takes on functions we consider basic to social welfare, it tends to be a heavily regulated industry. Federal statutes now mean that medical insurers generally cant charge more for a pre-existing condition or take genetic information into account. Long-term-care insurance, though, is a different creature. Here, insurers can sort applicants into different risk classes based on their medical histories and even their parents medical histories. They can charge higher rates, or deny coverage altogether, to certain applicants.Which brings us to you. The insurer could have asked other questions and learned facts that would have been relevant to your policys expected cost. Some questions go unasked because theyre not legally permitted (your race or national origin) or because the company has no way of telling if you have answered truthfully (Do you sometimes wake up with leg cramps?). Even if you think the insurer would be better off knowing the answer to a question it didnt ask (Do you think you have Parkinsons?), youre under no obligation to disclose it.After all, insurers already know about you. In the aggregate, I mean. You exemplify what they call adverse selection. Its the tendency of individuals who think they may be at particular risk to seek to insure themselves against that risk. Actuaries and underwriters aim to factor in the existence of such people (albeit not always successfully). Research has shown that, say, people at risk for Huntingtons are much more likely to have long-term-care policies. Underwriters stay in business by being students of human behavior. So youve already been priced in.As long as you are truthful in your application, then, youre not the fly in the ointment. You are, so to speak, on the ointments list of ingredients. All that said, the long-term-care insurance market doesnt work especially well these days. People are living longer, and ailing longer, than was anticipated two or three decades ago, when these products became available, and fewer policies have been dropped. Insurers have lost money; policyholders have faced sharp increases in rates; the overall market is small. Meanwhile, as more information about genetic susceptibilities becomes available to people, long-term-care insurers will want to know what applicants know.We could pass laws to prevent genetic discrimination (as we have with medical insurance), but knowing less than their applicants could drive insurers out of this market. In the end, I suspect, its going to seem sensible to create publicly funded arrangements that cover everyone.Finally, some medical (rather than ethical) advice. You might want to get yourself to a doctor to see whether your amateur diagnosis is right. For all you know, your symptoms might be the result of a condition best treated soon.I am a liberal white woman whose work is focused mainly on social justice (through education). I have an aunt by marriage who often posts links on Facebook that I find to be bigoted and racist. If my aunt were to express any of these views in person, I would immediately attempt to dissuade her. However, because these are merely posts on Facebook I have not spoken up. What is my moral and ethical obligation in this situation? My students are often on the receiving end of police brutality and systemic racism, and sitting idly by seems hypocritical. Name WithheldTwo things about your aunts posts are troubling. The first is what they reveal about her views. The second is what they add to the general level of online intolerance (which may contribute to the social wrongs that you mention). You might be able to do something about the first issue on your own. A persons life is ethically diminished when she has odious feelings and views, even if she doesnt act on them. Although its hard to get people to reconsider their positions, we have a better chance with those we know and love.On the second front, each of us can do a little, but change will only come from the concerted actions of many. People who realize these views are not only false but also harmful should say as much when the occasion arises. In so doing, as you point out, we also express our solidarity with those who suffer as a result.But we have to do this carefully. The object is to try to change peoples attitudes, not to make ourselves feel good. My bet is that your aunt doesnt recognize that shes a bigot. Some of her mistaken views may simply be the result of misinformation. Correcting facts can be more effective in changing a persons views than accusing the person of a vice, such as racism. And criticizing someone in public can be hurtful in a way that keeps the substance of what you are saying from being heard. So let me acknowledge a potential conflict between what will help your aunt be a better person and what will help improve the atmosphere on the web, which, at least in principle, may include taking issue with these views in front of third parties. Without wading into the debates over call-out culture, I suspect that especially with a relative, theres a good case for calling in, rather than calling out.You dont say how often you see your aunt in the flesh. When you do, it might be worth taking up these issues with her gently. Emails and Facebook comments are not very effective forms of communication about difficult issues. On the web, Im convinced that its more productive to produce and pass on helpful, positive ideas than to keelhaul people with harmful, negative ones. Evidence suggests, however, that this is a minority view."}
{"text": "The New York Times Company reported a $14 million net loss for the first quarter of 2016 as it continued to grapple with how to offset falling revenue in print advertising. Digital subscriptions remained a bright spot for the company, showing robust growth.In its earnings release on Tuesday, the company said it added 67,000 net digital-only subscriptions in the quarter, the most in a quarter since the end of 2012. The Times now has roughly 1.2 million digital-only subscriptions for its news products. Including its crossword product subscriptions, which accounted for about $2 million in revenue in the first quarter, the company counts close to 1.4 million digital-only subscriptions. By the end of the year, it expects to have more than 1.5 million digital-only subscriptions.This was a very strong quarter for our digital subscription business, Mark Thompson, the companys chief executive, said in an earnings call with investors. The rate at which we are adding subscriptions is continuing to accelerate.The net loss for the quarter was roughly the same as in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenue fell about 1 percent, to $380 million, from $384 million in the first quarter of 2015.Circulation revenue increased roughly 2 percent, to $218 million, as growth in digital subscription revenue and an increase in home-delivery prices offset a decline in print copies sold. The Times has a daily print circulation of 590,000, and 1.1 million on Sunday. Revenue from digital-only subscriptions increased about 14 percent, to $54 million, from $47 million in the first quarter of 2015.Advertising revenue remained a trouble spot, falling about 7 percent, to $140 million. Print advertising revenue dropped 9 percent, and digital advertising revenue fell about 1 percent, to $42 million, a figure that represents about a third of the companys total ad revenue. The company took a $41 million loss related to the announced closing of a paper mill in Maine.We remain bullish about our strategy, Mr. Thompson said, and believe that our timely pivot from traditional digital advertising towards branded content and marketing services, video and more seamlessly integrated ad formats on both mobile and desktop will deliver growth in the second half of 2016.The Times announced last week that it was planning to close its editing and prepress print production operations in Paris, which would result in the elimination or relocation of up to 70 jobs. It also said last month that it would invest more than $50 million over the next three years in an ambitious international digital expansion plan.These two announcements  demonstrating a willingness to invest substantially in digital growth, while applying rigor and realism to the economics of our mature print platforms  illustrate the approach we are taking everywhere, Mr. Thompson said.Adjusted operating profit, the companys preferred method for assessing performance, decreased to $52 million in the first quarter, from $59 million in the year-ago period.We believe there is considerable scope for further savings in the company, and we will be going after it in the coming months, Mr. Thompson said."}
{"text": "Islanders Coach Jack Capuano did not hide his anger after Brian Boyle scored an overtime goal to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a 5-4 victory Tuesday night at Barclays Center.Its a direct shot to the head, Capuano said, referring to an unpenalized hit Boyle had made on Islanders defenseman Thomas Hickey just before the goal. Those are the type of hits were trying to eliminate from our game.Such is playoff hockey.Boyle scored 2 minutes 48 seconds into the extra period to give the Lightning a two-games-to-one lead in the teams Eastern Conference semifinal series. The Lightning had forced overtime when Nikita Kucherov scored with 39 seconds left in the third period.Its just too bad it had to end that way, Capuano said. I thought we played one of the best games of the year. We came out tonight and played a hard game. Our guys should be proud of the effort.Asked if he thought he could be disciplined for the hit, Boyle, a former Ranger, said: I dont think so. Ive never had anything like that happen in my career.In a series needing a spark, the drama started in pregame warm-ups as Islanders defenseman Travis Hamonic had words at center ice with Boyle. The enforcers, Matt Martin of the Islanders and Mike Blunden of the Lightning, joined the discussion, and it was game on.The Lightning knew they would have to deal with a raucous crowd at Barclays Center, and the Islanders came out flying, bombarding Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop with 17 shots in the opening period.Josh Bailey, back in the Islanders lineup after missing the first two games of the series with an upper-body injury, scored the first of his two goals 7:55 into the first period.An eight-year Islanders veteran, Bailey had perplexed his coaches and fans with a confounding lack of offensive production. But Capuano made it clear after the optional morning skate that he still wanted Bailey in the lineup.It doesnt surprise me that he scored two goals, Capuano said. It doesnt surprise me that he gave us a boost. Thats what veteran guys do.Capuano said the Islanders, coming off a 4-1 loss on Saturday in Game 2 in Florida, needed to be more physical against the speedy Lightning.While there were no fisticuffs, the Islanders and the Lightning displayed their rugged best. There were numerous scrums after the whistle as players pushed and shoved one another.We knew they would come out strong in front of their home crowd, said Bishop, who made 35 saves. We knew there would be a push.The punishing play continued in the second period. Lightning forward Jonathan Drouin was dazed after an open-ice collision with Hickey, and the play started a skirmish in front of Islanders goaltender Thomas Greiss, who made 36 saves. Drouins head collided with Hickeys shoulder, sending Drouin flying. He left the game but later returned to assist on Kucherovs tying goal.The brisk pace continued as defenseman Victor Hedman put the Lightning ahead by 2-1 with a booming slap shot from the point 8:10 into the second. Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy answered with a point blast of his own at 14:50 to tie the game at 2-2.Bailey rewarded Capuanos faith by poking the puck past Bishop on a power play 2:27 into the third to put the Islanders ahead by 3-2. But Tampa Bays Vladislav Namestnikov answered at 3:25 to knot the score again.Cal Clutterbuck gave the Islanders a 4-3 lead with a goal at 11:23, and the Islanders seemed destined to capture a victory in regulation. But then Kucherov scored his team-leading seventh goal of the playoffs.Bailey said he was already turning the page after his strong performance and looking ahead to Game 4, at home on Friday.These swings in momentum are all part of the ride, he said. You refocus and get ready for next one."}
{"text": "Sheldon Silver, who rose from the Lower East Side of Manhattan to become one of the states most powerful and feared politicians as speaker of the New York Assembly, was sentenced on Tuesday to 12 years in prison in a case that came to symbolize Albanys culture of graft.The conviction of Mr. Silver, 72, served as a capstone to a campaign against public corruption by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has led to more than a dozen state lawmakers being convicted or pleading guilty.But none had the power, cachet or longevity that Mr. Silver, a Democrat, had enjoyed, and prosecutors sought to make an example of him. They asked that he receive a sentence greater than the terms that had been imposed on other New York State legislators convicted of public corruption offenses.The longest such sentence cited by the government was 14 years, the term imposed last year in the case of another former Democratic assemblyman, William F. Boyland Jr., who was tried and convicted in federal court in Brooklyn.Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in Manhattan noted that even before Mr. Silvers arrest, when some of his fellow legislators had been arrested on corruption charges, he remained undeterred. One would think that the image of Mr. Silvers colleagues being arrested and led off to jail would have caused someone who was basically honest to reappraise what was going on, Judge Caproni said.Instead, she said, Mr. Silver stopped nothing, continuing to lie to his staff and to the press while holding himself out as a paragon of virtue.Judge Caproni said that there had been an incalculable, intangible harm to the people of New York, and that the cumulative effect of public corruption makes the public very cynical. She then listed some of Mr. Silvers misdeeds and addressed him directly: Mr. Silver, those are not the actions of a basically honest person.In court, Carrie H. Cohen, an assistant United States attorney, had asked that Mr. Silvers sentence reflect the massive damage caused to the public by his crimes.The sentence, Ms. Cohen continued, should send a message that this is not the way business is done in Albany, or at least that it shouldnt be, and that no one, including Sheldon Silver, is above the law.Mr. Silver briefly addressed the court before his sentence was delivered, saying he had let down his constituents, family and colleagues. Im truly, truly sorry for that, he said.Mr. Silver was convicted on Nov. 30 of charges that included honest services fraud, money laundering and extortion. Upon his conviction, he forfeited his Assembly seat. Two weeks later, Dean G. Skelos, who as majority leader had been Mr. Silvers Republican counterpart in the State Senate, was also convicted of corruption.Mr. Skelos is to be sentenced on May 12; a week later, John L. Sampson, a former leader of the Senate Democrats, will face his own sentencing. Prosecutors scrutiny of New York lawmakers continues: Several inquiries are now focused on possible wrongdoing connected to the administrations of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats.To date, however, Mr. Silvers precipitous fall has no recent rival in the world of New York politics.In a statement issued moments after the sentencing, Mr. Bharara said that the stiff sentence is a just and fitting end to Sheldon Silvers long career of corruption.Mr. Silver had served for more than two decades as the Assembly speaker, imposing his will on matters large and small; he had a reputation as a staunch defender of New York City, a shrewd negotiator in budget talks and, at times, a recalcitrant opponent of anything he disliked.But during a five-week trial last fall, a different side of Mr. Silver emerged. Evidence showed that he had obtained nearly $4 million in illicit fees in return for taking official actions that benefited a prominent cancer researcher, Dr. Robert N. Taub, at Columbia University, and two real estate developers, Glenwood Management and the Witkoff Group.Mr. Silver had expressed regret that his actions made the State Capitol the object of ridicule. In a letter sent last month to Judge Caproni, he offered an emotional apology, saying that he had failed the people of New York.His lawyers had argued that the former speaker should be allowed to use his unique talents to benefit others, and that a sentence that incorporates extensive community service and little  if any  incarceration could do that. Mr. Silvers lawyers had suggested that he could work with the Fortune Society to help current and former inmates find jobs.One of Mr. Silvers lawyers, Joel Cohen, told the judge that his client had been devastated and crushed by everything that had happened. Notwithstanding everything he has done, Mr. Cohen said, his obituary has already been written.Another prosecutor, Howard S. Master, on Tuesday questioned the authenticity of Mr. Silvers contrition, noting he had insisted that he would be exonerated until the very moment of the jurys verdict.Judge Caproni, citing Mr. Silvers age, said she would not adhere to sentencing guidelines that recommended a term of roughly 22 to 27 years, calling such a sentence draconian and unjust. The courts probation office had recommended a 10-year sentence.The judge ordered that Mr. Silver forfeit more than $5 million in proceeds from his crimes and pay a $1.75 million fine.She rejected a defense assertion that Mr. Silvers actions had not caused discernible harm. She said the specter of corruption made it impossible to know whether government officials were making decisions for the right reasons or for personal financial gain.His crimes cast a shadow over everything he has done and has thrown into doubt every difficult decision any legislator has ever made, the judge said.Mr. Silver must surrender himself by noon on July 1; his lawyers have requested that he serve at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N.Y., a prison known for its familiarity with the housing of prisoners who, like Mr. Silver, are Orthodox Jews.Governor Cuomo said on Tuesday: Todays decision sent a simple message that officials who abuse the publics trust will be held accountable. Justice was served.Last month, prosecutors, in a written submission to the judge, offered what they said was additional evidence of the ways Mr. Silver had abused his office for personal benefit, by helping two women with whom he had conducted extramarital affairs.One of the women had regularly lobbied Mr. Silver on behalf of clients with business before the state; he had used his official position, prosecutors said, to help the other woman get a state job.Mr. Silvers lawyers said after the hearing that his case would be appealed. Mr. Silver, addressing a crowd of reporters, said, I believe in the justice system in this nation, and well pursue whatever remedies the system makes available."}
{"text": "If the structure of the universe is a result of a pattern of vibration, what causes the vibration? Stephon Alexander asks in his new book, The Jazz of Physics. And does that vibration mean that the universe is behaving like an instrument? In the most engaging chapters of this book  part memoir, part history of science, part physics popularization and part jazz lesson  Dr. Alexander ventures far out onto the cutting edge of modern cosmology, presenting a compelling case for vibration and resonance being at the heart of the physical structure we find around us, from the smallest particle of matter to the largest clusters of galaxies.A professor of physics at Dartmouth College and a lifelong student of jazz, Dr. Alexander has taken on the challenge to find an isomorphism between jazz and cosmology. Establishing this analogy is a fascinating prospect and a tall order. Though Dr. Alexander doesnt succeed in uncovering a profound connection between jazz and physics, or proving that they share a common shape, his report on the state of research into the structure and history of the universe  his own academic field  makes for compelling reading, as does his life story.The son of working-class immigrants to New York from Trinidad, he was considered slow as a child. But he steadfastly clung to an inspiration sparked during a school trip to the American Museum of Natural History as an 8-year-old, where he saw a photograph of Albert Einstein posing in front of a wall of equations. Against considerable odds, he went on to get a Ph.D. in physics  he says he was one of only three black doctoral students in physics at the time in the United States  and eventually received tenure at Dartmouth as an associate professor of physics and astronomy. All the while, he pursued his passion for jazz saxophone and improvisation.Some of Dr. Alexanders analogies to jazz feel natural. In a chapter on quantum physics, he likens the physicist Richard Feynmans conception of the motion of a quantum particle to the way a jazz improviser may aim for a target note during a solo: In both, he says, all possible paths to the destination are considered before one is settled on. Later, at a jazz club, the saxophonist Mark Turner says to Dr. Alexander, When Im in the middle of a solo, whenever I am most certain of the next note I have to play, the more possibilities open up for the notes that follow. This is analogous in Dr. Alexanders eyes to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the more one knows about the position of a quantum particle, the less one can know about where its going.Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science, but man needs both, Fritjof Capra wrote in his 1975 best seller, The Tao of Physics, which explores parallels between quantum physics and Eastern mysticism. The question that can be asked of that book and The Jazz of Physics is whether each subject really illuminates the other, whether the analogy adds up to more than the sum of its parts.Do we understand Feynman diagrams or the Uncertainty Principle any better for having seen them through the lens of improvisation? Or better understand jazz for having compared it to quantum physics? Not really. And these are the analogies that work best. Many others feel strained, like Dr. Alexanders idea that John Coltrane incredibly, correctly realized that cosmic expansion is a form of antigravity, which rests on the titles that Coltrane chose for his late-period albums, among them Cosmic Music and Stellar Regions.Deep down, the book feels like an attempt by Dr. Alexander to understand how his passions for physics and jazz can coexist so intensely. It also makes clear that thinking deeply about music has helped him to think freely  and led him to some of his best academic research. But the connection is above all personal.Dr. Alexander valiantly if laboriously takes us through the full history of physics, from Pythagoras to Einstein. But it is in the later chapters investigating the forefront of cosmological inquiry that his book really comes to life, even if this has little to do with jazz. Still, you are left with the feeling of having had some basic concepts overexplained while some tantalizing, speculative ones  like the left- or right-handed spin of gravitational waves, which he says interact with matter and antimatter differently and could explain the emergence of matter in the early universe  are merely touched on.The art of analogy is a difficult one, especially when its being sustained for the duration of a book. In juggling, if the path of each ball, from the throw to the catch, is just right, the crossing of the balls in the air can create magic. But fumble one and the whole performance suffers. Dr. Alexander fumbles too often here  his writing about music is plagued by factual errors. A few examples: When a string tuned to the note C is divided into one quarter of its length, we get an F note, he writes, when in fact we would get a C, two octaves up.Later, in an analysis of a mandala drawn by Coltrane for Yusef Lateef, he says that in a reading of the diagram, we get C, C-sharp, E, F and F-sharp, which is an all-interval tetrachord, when a tetrachord has only four notes, and the all-interval tetrachord, which is asymmetric, couldnt logically be outlined in Coltranes entirely symmetric drawing. A diagram purporting to show the fivefold symmetry of the C major pentatonic scale incorrectly implies that the interval between C and G is the same as that between E and C.Considering Dr. Alexanders scientific bent, its surprising that its in the technical aspects of music that he falters. His more poetic ideas about music can be powerful, like his speculation that the reason why music has the ability to move us so deeply is that it is an auditory allusion to our basic connection to the universe. This not only feels true; it is what musicians live for."}
{"text": "Declan Walsh recently visited Damascus, the war-weary Syrian capital, and the government-controlled part of the divided city of Aleppo. Below, he answers selected readers questions about his reporting trip to Syria, life in devastated parts of the country, and how Syrians view their prospects.Q: Is there any semblance of normal life in Aleppo, or is it on complete lockdown? Do you see office workers commuting every morning, vendors selling street food, taxis, etc.? Or is it more of a ghost town?  MICHAEL SANDER, @speedplane on TwitterA: One of the most striking things about Aleppo is how much of the city appears to be functioning relatively normally. Much of the periphery has been reduced to rubble. But in the city center, I saw people on the sidewalks, traffic flowing, hotels and cafes with plenty of customers, and universities and schools open for students.The strange part is that the backdrop to the daily bustle is a cacophony of booms. I regularly heard explosions from falling shells or, from the other side of the front line, the sound of Russian jets bombing rebel-held areas. Many of the residents I met said they just filter those noises out; theyve just gotten used to it.It was only when we got close to the front line, which divides government-controlled Syria from rebel-held territory, that things changed dramatically: Streets were emptied out, and some parts of the city, including the old city  a Unesco-designated World Heritage site  were sealed off by the military.Q: Im always surprised to read how normal life can be in war zones  the fact that there even is an upscale restaurant to eat in amazes me. This also means it might not take that long to make Aleppo livable again. From what you have seen, how much of a challenge will reconstruction eventually be?  MARKUS WAGNER, Vienna, Austria (@MarkusWagnerAT on Twitter)A: Reconstruction, when it finally happens, will be a daunting challenge in Syria. In Aleppo, huge swaths of the city have been reduced to rubble, and the basic municipal infrastructure  water, electricity, sewage  has been badly compromised too.Residents are getting by with jury-rigged systems: a network of private diesel generators, and some emergency solutions put in place by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other aid groups. Walking down the street, I saw a lattice of electricity cables overhead. Thats how people in Aleppo are drawing their power from these private generators. But those makeshift systems are highly vulnerable to the fighting.Aleppo was Syrias industrial hub before the war, and it still has a large community of wealthy businessmen. I met two of them at the Aleppo Chamber of Commerce last Thursday, and it was very strange to hear them speak bullishly about Aleppos prospects, and their plans to rebuild, while something like a dozen bombs exploded during our hourlong interview.Q: What is the status of rebuilding in Aleppo? Have the souk merchants been able to replenish their supplies and regain clientele?  RICK HAUSER, @RAH2009 on TwitterA: The front line runs right through the old souk, which has been partially destroyed by combat. I got to visit one small part of it, where I interviewed Rose Abu Jaffar, the former zookeeper. To talk safely, we had to drive quickly through a maze of narrow and empty streets until we got to the little bunker where she and a couple of other government fighters were posted.So whats become of the shop owners? Many have transplanted their businesses to a sort of sidewalk souk in safer parts of the city: A long line of stalls have popped up outside a row of apartment buildings and shops in the downtown area. Aleppo has lots of broad, French-style boulevards wide enough to accommodate the new stores. But the sidewalk souk is much smaller than the original.Q: Is the average citizen more pro-Assad or anti-Assad?  ALDEN LOFQUISTA: From the immigration hall, where I crossed into Syria from Lebanon, to the most remote desert outposts, I saw posters of President Assad. It got me thinking about whether that profusion of imagery represents strength or weakness. Its hard to tell.As in most war zones, its very difficult to gauge public opinion because people fear the consequences of speaking their mind, or even discussing politics openly. In Syria, its all the more difficult because the country is geographically fragmented, divided among rebels, Islamic State militants and government forces.Still, there were some indicators of Mr. Assads popularity. In Aleppo, I met people from minority communities  particularly Armenian Syrians  who were unabashed supporters of his rule. They saw Mr. Assad as their protector against Islamist rebels who, they said, would push them from Syria if they won the war. But I also met a disillusioned military officer  a Sunni Muslim, from a different part of the country  who quietly asserted that it was time for President Assad to go. After 46 years of rule by the Assad family, the officer said, we have lost more than enough. He did not want to be identified, for obvious reasons.Q: The situation in Aleppo is very dangerous. How did you and The Times make the decision to go? What precautions did you take? Did you travel with a government and/or rebel minder?  LUKE JOHNSON, Washington, D.C.A: The New York Times has detailed security procedures for reporting from countries like Syria. Before leaving Damascus for Aleppo, I sent an outline of my trip to editors in New York and a security manager in Europe, with details about how I was traveling, with whom, and where we would stay. I carried a flak jacket and a first-aid kit, and was in regular contact with a Times security officer via a messaging service.After a discussion, we figured the risks were manageable: The road into Aleppo, although it had been under attack a month ago, was now open to regular traffic. International aid officials in Damascus who had been to Aleppo advised that it was possible to work there, with precautions.Still, such plans are inevitably provisional, and on the ground the best security often involves taking advice from local residents. That is how it worked in Aleppo when, on my second day of reporting, the area where we were staying came under intense rebel shelling.I traveled with an interpreter and a Syrian Information Ministry minder named Bacil. He was very polite, didnt usually get in the way of my reporting and had some charming idiosyncrasies. A huge fan of British culture, Bacil told me that he had learned English, in part, from TV series like Blackadder, Fawlty Towers and the childrens cartoon Danger Mouse. When his mobile phone rang, it played the BBC World Service theme. He had never visited Britain, but said he hoped to do so one day.Ostensibly Bacils job was to facilitate my work and translate as necessary, particularly with government officials. But he was also there to keep tabs on where I went, who I met and ensure that I didnt take photos of military checkpoints. In Aleppo, our team picked up a second minder, from the local information ministry. In interviews I was often accompanied by at least three other people  not ideal, but there was little choice in the matter.Q: People say Syrians should stay in their country and fight to keep it rather than leaving for other countries. How realistic is it for ordinary people to stay there and fight back?  ANN D. HOANG, San Francisco, Calif.A: Just a couple of days of interviews in Damascus offered an eye-opening perspective on the plight of displaced Syrians.So many people had been displaced once, twice or even three times in the course of this long war. Their homes had been destroyed, or lay behind rebel lines. I could see why so many had sent family members  sons, daughters, cousins  on the dangerous journey to Europe.Young men face the possibility of conscription into the Army, and being sent to the front lines, if they remain in Syria. If they leave, they can send their families a remittance from abroad  even $100 a month can go a long way in Syria.Few of the people I spoke to appeared to have any appetite for a fight. The war now involves a number of foreign forces, including Russia, Iran, the United States and Saudi Arabia. It has become impossibly complicated. I didnt ask them if they wanted to fight, but if I had, I imagine their response would have been: Fight whom? And for what?"}

{"text": "HONG KONG  Chinese regulators have begun an investigation into the Internet giant Baidu after the death of a college student who said he received distorted information on cancer treatment from the companys search engine.The student, Wei Zexi, 21, from the central province of Shaanxi, died of synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer, on April 12. Before his death, he wrote a long post on a Chinese website that detailed his experience seeking treatment.In a promoted search result on Baidu, he learned of a hospital in Beijing that offered treatment for people with his condition. His family borrowed money to raise the more than 200,000 renminbi, or about $30,000, to pay for a type of immunotherapy from the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps.Mr. Weis form of cancer is generally treated with surgery and chemotherapy, and he accused Baidu of taking money to promote less proven treatments in its search results. After his death, the search company has been denounced online, with some people calling it by the similar sounding , or 100 poisons.China has strict laws against false advertising in medical products, but how they apply to online search results is not clear. It also is unclear whether the promoted link that Mr. Wei followed was in fact misleading.\"Companies that were involved in services that deal with human life should be particularly conscientious of their duties when conducting their businesses, the website of Peoples Daily, the Communist Partys flagship publication, wrote in a commentary that questioned Baidus corporate ethics. Billions of net users trusted Baidu for their search engine and online forum services, the company is hence responsible for the trust and is obligated to taking up their social responsibilities.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the countrys online regulator, acknowledged the public complaints and said on Monday that it would conduct a joint investigation into Baidu with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce as well as the National Health and Family Planning Commission.Government and military health authorities have announced a separate investigation into the hospital, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported on Tuesday.Our deepest condolences go out to Wei Zexis family, Tracy Hu, a Baidu spokeswoman, wrote by email. Baidu is a trusted company and we uphold extremely high standards to make our platform safe and trustworthy.On its Weibo account, Baidu said that the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps, where Mr. Wei received treatment, is a top-level institution.We will cooperate with law enforcement investigations to the best of our ability and crack down on all illegal behavior, Baidu said in a Weibo post. And we strongly call on the management departments of related hospital bureaus to strengthen hospital supervision and build a trustworthy treatment environment for patients.The Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps has not yet commented on the case. A representative for the hospital could not be reached on Tuesday.Baidu has faced criticism before over the handling of health-related information. In January, it overhauled its health forums after the moderator of a hemophilia discussion group said the management of the page had been sold to a private hospital. In 2012, Zhou Hongyi, the chief executive of the Internet company Qihoo 360, accused Baidu of relying on advertisements of fake health care products for 30 percent of its revenue.Mr. Wei wrote that he did not know that when he consulted Baidu for medical information.Baidu, at that time I didnt know how sinister it could be, he wrote. Bidding for ranking on medical information, or the matter with the hemophilia page, should make it clear what sort of thing it was.Baidu says it applies particular vigilance to health care pages and has proactively cleaned up the customer base by using certification standards and screening potentially misleading ads.Mr. Weis death has also increased attention on medical entrepreneurs connected with the so-called Putian system, named after the city in Fujian Province from which many of them came. The entrepreneurs made money by selling folk remedies and went on to invest in hospitals around the country.They are now represented by a national association, the Putian (Chinese) Health Industry Association. Last year, the association was reported to have 8,600 member hospitals, about 80 percent of all private hospitals in China.The spread of the Putian hospitals has relied on widespread online advertising, and Chinese news outlets have questioned the reliability of such promotions.It is necessary to conduct an in-depth review, alongside a serious investigation over whether Baidus business is legal, of why, despite prohibitions and supervision, a number of Putian system medical institutions can still rely on swindling to become a formidable presence in Chinas medical market, The Beijing News wrote in a commentary on Tuesday.It was not immediately clear if the department in the Beijing hospital that treated Mr. Wei had a connection to a Putian system company. Although some Chinese news outlets suggested a link, a nurse at the hospital told Huashang Bao, a newspaper based in Xian, that the hospital itself controlled the department."}
{"text": "MANCHESTER, England  Who wants Brexit? Not David Cameron, the British prime minister, for he opposes it. Not the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, whose Euroskepticism is subsumed by fear of Little Englander nationalism. And not even Boris Johnson, the mayor of London and unofficial leader of the campaign to leave the European Union, who has spent much of his career arguing that Britain would be better off in a reformed union.But Mr. Johnson wants to be prime minister, and many of the Conservative Party members who will select their next leader are euroskeptic. And so last month Mr. Johnson came to Manchester to campaign for Brexit in a disused television studio that was ugly, cold and half-filled with an audience that was largely white and middle age.Its a question of sovereignty. I would like our parliament to be sovereign and make its own decisions, said Michael Powell, a retired doctor. I fear that if we dont leave the E.U. we shall be overwhelmed by people who wish to come here.I feel that we are being taken over. This open border with all the trouble in the world is so scary, said Susan Fink, another retiree. It seems its only the common man on the street who seems to know that its being used to traffic people and terrorists all over Europe.It is usual for europhiles to call euroskeptics racists and imbeciles dreaming of a Britain that never was  a happy Britain in control of one-quarter of a happy world. But many of the people I met were rational and frightened. (Others were more amorous: I met a femme fatale with a leg in plaster cast. On it was scrawled, like a lovers note, #Brexit.)Then came Mr. Johnson. His weapon is comic derision, his tragic flaw is glibness. Some call him Britains Donald Trump. Both men are raging narcissists and blondes, both are media obsessions, both loathe detail  for what has that to do with them? But I do not think Mr. Trump speaks Latin, as Mr. Johnson does, so I will assist him: The Latin for Mexicans Go Home is Mexicani Ite Domum!He rolled on his heels and called Brits passengers locked in the back of a minicab with a wonky satnav driven by a driver who doesnt have perfect command of English and going in a direction we, frankly, dont want to go. He thinks he is Winston Churchill, but he is really Lord Halifax who, after the fall of France in 1940, wished to lead Britain out of the turmoil of Europe and back to the splendid isolation of 19th-century British self-confidence. In 1940 this position was called appeasement.The Remain Camp oppose isolation, splendid or dismal. If Britain leaves the European Union, this camp says, we will lose our global prominence and the economy will shrink by a very precise 6 percent by 2030.Knickers to the pessimists and to the merchants of gloom, said Mr. Johnson to the audience, who cheered. If we hold our nerve and were not cowed and we vote for freedom and we vote for democracy on June 23 then I believe this country will prosper and thrive as never before  and yes it will be independence day on June 24.Even as he delighted the crowd, I pondered Mr. Johnsons ability or even desire to save democracy in Britain. His Conservative party has disenfranchised voters and is planning to cut funding to opposition parties. Mr. Johnsons term as mayor of London, which ends this week, has been marked chiefly by crises left unsolved. (In a poll last year Londoners had the most pessimistic views of any region in Britain of his prime ministerial potential.)He likes to distract from his inadequacies by, say, dangling from a zip wire while holding two union flags, as he did in 2012, or by bullying journalists, as Mr. Trump might. At the rally in Manchester Mr. Johnson spotted Michael Crick, a television journalist, doing a piece live on camera. He said, Shut up ... Can we tell Crick ... Can someone go and interrupt Crick at the back there?A bald man tried to stop the broadcast but Crick was insistent: Im just trying to explain whats going on here, he said. Mr. Johnson did not want Mr. Crick to explain anything. He prefers the trivial questions, and Mr. Crick does not ask them. During the Q&A that followed his speech, a man asked Mr. Johnson who styled his hair. The moderator asked, Do you have a real question? But I have followed Mr. Johnson for years, and that is a real question.He also resorts to Little Englander nationalism  not from conviction, but from cynicism: Last month Mr. Johnson suggested, in an essay for a right-wing British tabloid, that the part-Kenyan Barack Obama might have an ancestral dislike of the British empire.The Brexit camp is not all nostalgists longing to return to British exceptionalism. Mostly it attracts people who fear that Brussels excludes them and that there is a genuine deficit of democracy in Britain; that the political class, with a few exceptions, has forgotten them. They are not wrong. Where they err is in believing that a politician who deals in trivia and bombast will treat them any better. Mr. Johnson believes in Mr. Johnson. The Brexit campaign is only a step on the path of his ambition."}

{"text": "HONG KONG  In China, an iPhone can be found for a small fraction of the official price. It just might not be a phone.A Chinese company has won the right to sell its leather goods under the iPhone trademark after years of legal back-and-forth with Apple, according to an article in Chinese state news media. The case is yet another that centers on names that are well established in much of the world but that have had to fight for control in China, such as the basketball star Michael Jordan and the shoe brand New Balance.The Chinese company, Xintong Tiandi, applied for the iPhone trademark in China just after the first Apple smartphones came out, in 2007, according to an article by the state-run Legal Daily last week. Still, Xintong Tiandis trademark in China, for leather goods, was approved before Apples, which had applied for the rights in 2002, the article said.The website of Xintong Tiandi features a range of leather products, including pen cases, passport holders, handbags and wallets, all stamped with iPhone. None of the products are phones. In a news release issued last week, the company also featured photographs of its other products, like a leather iPad case labeled iphone next to a bottle of Rmy Martin Cognac.In the news release, the Chinese company said that the huge victory brings esteem to Xintong Tiandis promise to protect the iPhone trademark, before adding that it was willing to work with the American technology giant.The sentiment may not be shared, however. Apple is disappointed the Beijing Higher Peoples Court chose to allow Xintong to use the iPhone mark for leather goods when we have prevailed in several other cases against Xintong, the Silicon Valley company said in a statement on Wednesday. We intend to request a retrial with the Supreme Peoples Court and will continue to vigorously protect our trademark rights.While the Chinese companys approach might be perplexing, it testifies to the power of Apples name recognition in the country. The iPhone brand signals middle- or even upper-class status in China, and many are expected to be willing to pay for a passport cover or other item labeled with the Apple products name as a way to show that they have made it.The iPhone ruling, in a high court in the Beijing municipality, is just one of a spate of high-profile trademark and piracy cases in China. The countrys huge number of factories, bolstered by a 100 million-strong class of migrant workers, has made China the workshop of the world, able, among other activities, to quickly pump out products that can make a company a quick profit on the impulse to imitate.Aiding them is a first-to-file trademark system that lets unrelated third parties register trademarks which are copies or imitations of well-known brands, according to a post last year from law firm DLA Piper.Among other high-profile cases, Michael Jordan lost the rights to the name he is known by in China, and New Balance paid $16 million in damages for what a court said was the illegal use of the Chinese name for the company, which a person had trademarked.Apple had previously faced a similar situation with the iPad. In 2012, the company was forced to pay $60 million for the rights to use the iPad trademark in China. Apple had bought the rights to the name in a number of countries, but after iPad tablet sales took off in China, a Chinese company said it had not secured the rights in that country.The case caps a tough couple of weeks for Apple. Last month, the companys iTunes Movies and iBooks stores in China were ordered shut by a national regulator. The company also reported last week that sales in China had dropped, as it struggles to keep the loyalty and admiration of fickle Chinese consumers."}
{"text": "These are the strange and tortuous days in Presumptive Trump America.Its Cinco de Mayo, and the Republican National Committee just put out a statement honoring the many ways Mexican-Americans have enriched our countrys culture. Its not clear whether this includes the millions of them that the partys likely standard-bearer has vowed to deport, but these are the kinds of awkward matters that will preoccupy Presumptive Trump America in the weeks and months ahead. Where to even begin?Maybe here, with something that popped onto my Twitter machine yesterday via The Manchester Union-Leader: N.H. Senator Ayotte Will Support  but Not Endorse  Trump, reads the headline. That certainly clarifies things.It also helps explain why so many people think politicians are weenies. And why they are fundamentally correct. And why Donald Trump is now completing his bull-rush though the paper wall of the Republican Party.For as remarkable as Trumps rise has been, whats maybe more remarkable is how he has exposed the lameness of the political ranks he is seeking to join. Why does he even have to bother with some of these losers now? Trump seemed to be wondering as much Wednesday morning when he was asked on the Today show whether he would be able to unite the Republican Party. I am confident that I can unite much of it, he said. There are parts of it I dont want. This struck me as the kind of perfectly Trumpian declaration  smirking, confident and dismissive  that explains how Trumps romp over what was supposedly an elite Republican field looked almost easy in the end.With the ranks of the defeated now completed  John Kasich quit the race on Wednesday  Trumps victims are now lining up to demonstrate their rationalized devotion to their abuser. It is a diminishing spectacle. Bobby Jindal, a onetime Republican star who flailed wildly at Trump during his short-lived quiver of a campaign, said on Wednesday that he would most likely be voting for Trump in November. Im not happy about it, he felt the need to add.Neither, apparently, are some officials at the Republican National Committee. Committee staff members were told that if they cant support Trump, they should leave by the end of the week, according to The New York Times. The words kicking and screaming come to mind: unity, or else.On Monday, Jon Huntsman, a former Republican governor of Utah and proponent of the gentlemans centrism embodied by his nonprofit group, No Labels, seemed to endorse Trump, the Master Labeler himself  the man who labeled Lyin Ted Cruz, Little Marco Rubio and Low Energy Jeb Bush, among others. Yes labels.You can certainly see how many Republicans find themselves in a tough spot. They think that Hillary Clinton is awful and that it might be politically problematic for them as Republicans to say theyd vote for her, even if they believe Trump would be worse. Its considered unseemly for politicians to say they plan to stay home in November rather than vote, even if thats what they plan to do. No third-party option has come forward. But theres also something hilarious about Marco Rubio calling Trump the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency during his campaign and then last week pivoting to say that Trumps performance has improved significantly. He added that hes more certain than ever that he will support the Republican nominee now that its apparent that Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic nominee, as if that prospect came out of nowhere (or that he might be Feeling the Bern otherwise).Ted Cruz, meanwhile, called Trump a pathological liar and a narcissist at a level I dont think this countrys ever seen as recently as Tuesday. (This was after his father said electing the alternative to his son would signal the destruction of America, which led Trump to insinuate that Raphael Cruz had a role in the John F. Kennedy assassination. 2016.). And yet Cruz has said repeatedly that he would support Trump if he were the Republican nominee  though he did show signs of perhaps reconsidering after Trump started mocking Cruzs wife. Cruz said nothing about supporting Trump in his departure speech on Tuesday night, while Trump played gracious and praised Lyin Ted as tough, smart and one hell of a competitor.If Cruz really does plan to be the skunk at the garden party that he claimed, shouldnt he have made it clear by now that he would not support Trump under any circumstances? But this is Presumptive Trump America, a land of heavy pressure to finesse and contort  even if it lands you on the side of a pathological liar who would ensure the destruction of America. Also, Cruz will probably run again in 2020, for what thats worth. There are always considerations. It will be awkward."}

And though Guardiola tried to say on Tuesday that titles are not everything, he knows that that is how he will be judged.He inherited a Bayern that won everything, including the Champions League, in the final season of his predecessor, Jupp Heynckes. And to lose not one, but three semifinals in his three-year term as Heynckess successor will inevitably go down as a legacy of failure.Outside, on the grass where Atltico Madrid had on Tuesday done just enough to eliminate Bayern, Atlticos coach, Diego Simeone, ended the night as we have not seen him before.At the final whistle, Simeone was bent over. Crouched on his haunches, his face hidden in his hands, he tried to hold back tears and stop trembling. He was elated and emotionally spent. His team, with comparatively fewer resources and with substantially less of the ball, had squeezed victory out of adversity.The format of Champions League soccer invites this conundrum. When teams finish with one game won and the other lost, and tied on the aggregate score, the away goals break the tie.Atltico won 1-0 in Madrid last week, and lost 2-1 in Munich this week.Without dirty or particularly ugly play, Simeones Atltico had done exactly this to Barcelona in the quarterfinals, too. We played against two of the three best teams in the world, Simeone said. We went through, with difficulties; Im very proud.In the first half tonight, we were up against the best team Ive seen in my career. Bayerns display was unbelievable. We fought, we had to suffer, and weve made it through to the final.Atltico, like the remarkable Leicester City, is noteworthy for the heart and spirit and inexhaustible effort with which it defies the odds. Leicesters winning the English league was a 5,000-to-1 shot; and what would be the odds against Atltico Madrids reaching the final of the Champions League for the second time in three years? And, moreover, for a second time having sold its top strikers and top goalkeeper and found others to step up to the defiant way that Coach Simeone wins contests.Let us be clear. There are more ways than one to win matches, and if Guardiolas way is to coax beauty almost like a symphony of talents out of great players, there is also virtue in Simeones achieving results with supposedly lesser players and with tactics that contain the opponents before striking them when they are weary.Simeones teams are unfailingly fit to run the 90 minutes, and more. They are competing  again  against Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Spanish league, which is tougher to win than the German Bundesliga.And when it is played within the rules, Atlticos minimalist style has to be acknowledged. The purpose is to reach the next round, and Simeones team exposes as nonsense the current trend to throw numbers at everything and to draw conclusions from those numbers.The statistics say that Atltico had barely one-third of ball possession in the four games of the Champions League against Barcelona and Bayern. Atltico beat neither on goals scored. But it did the hardest thing, scoring an away goal in each contest.So when both coaches, and the computer wizards, avow that Bayern appeared overwhelmingly the more accomplished side in the Allianz on Tuesday, their opinion is baseless.Bayern missed chances before it opened the scoring Tuesday through a free kick from Xabi Alonso that deflected into the net off the knee of the defender Jos Mara Gimnez.Moments later, Gimnez conceded a penalty kick that was wasted by Thomas Mller, whose meek shot was anticipated and saved by the excellent goalkeeper, Jan Oblak.We did many things right, and a few things wrong, Mller said. It may not have eased his pain that Atltico was later given a generous penalty kick, and that was similarly tamely struck by Fernando Torres and saved by Manuel Neuer.But before that, Atltico had changed its tactical approach at halftime. Its new plan was to press Bayern deeper, to suppress the home side in its own half.Simeone had dared to take off a defensive midfield player, and replaced him with a winger. That approach paid its dividend in the 54th minute when Atltico broke like a stone out of a sling.Torres passed to Antoine Griezmann from the center circle, and Griezmann had the speed to get behind the Bayern defense, and the composure to wait for Neuer to rush toward him before calmly stroking the ball around the keeper.Griezmann follows a long line of Atltico strikers  Sergio Agero, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa among them  polished by Atltico and sold for profit. It is a wonderful trick.Simeone has others. His team suffered when Bayern regained the lead through Robert Lewandowskis headed goal in the 75th minute. That left a quarter-hour, 20 minutes given time added on for deliberate time-wasting by Atltico, but by then exhaustion had set in, and organized resistance rode out the pressure.Bayern feels the hurt, Atltico is in another final, and Simeone is trying to win Europes most coveted title before, inevitably, Griezmann is sold to the highest bidder."}

{"text": "In response to calls from the Anti-Defamation League, Donald J. Trump on Thursday said he disavows comments by David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, about Jewish extremists who opposed his candidacy.It is the latest instance of Mr. Duke praising Mr. Trump, who was condemned by politicians across the spectrum months ago for refusing to explicitly disavow Mr. Duke, a white supremacist who has exalted the the Manhattan businessmans political rise. Mr. Trump has previously rebutted the criticisms by saying he had disavowed Mr. Duke on other occasions.Jewish chutzpah knows no bounds, Mr. Duke said on his radio program, excoriating some of the donors involved in the Stop Trump movement. Those donors include the billionaire financier Paul Singer, a Jew for whom Israels security is a primary focus in determining the candidates he backs.I think these Jewish extremists have made a terribly crazy miscalculation because all theyre really going to be doing by doing the Never Trump movement is exposing their alien, their anti-American-majority position to all the Republicans, Mr. Duke said. And theyre going to push people more into awareness that the neo-cons are the problem, that these Jewish supremacists who control our country are the real problem and the reason why America is not great.Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement that David Dukes latest remarks  smearing Jews and Jewish Republicans specifically  are as unsurprising as they are hateful.The onus is now on Donald Trump to make unequivocally clear he rejects those sentiments and that there is no room for Duke and anti-Semitism in his campaign and in society, he said. Mr. Trump can and should speak up now. If not, his silence will speak volumes.Later Thursday, Mr. Trump said in a statement that he totally disavows Mr. Dukes remarks.Antisemitism has no place our society, which needs to be united, not divided, said Mr. Trump, who has been accused of using overtly racial appeals to motivate his largely white, working-class political base.The Anti-Defamation League has criticized Mr. Trump before, and has redirected his previous donations to the group because of his remarks about Muslims and others. Mr. Trump has often cited his ties to the Jewish community, noting, for instance, that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an Orthodox Jew, and that his daughter, Ivanka, converted to Judaism."}
{"text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn.  Zenobia Dobson removed the envelope from her mailbox and placed it, unopened, in her apartment in the Lonsdale Homes public housing complex, her living room already crowded with artifacts of mourning, respect and unrecoverable loss.There were the football jerseys, framed but not yet hung on the walls, in honor of her dead son. Proclamations from the city and county. A large painting of his face in the clouds. His weight bench, still by the front door.There was also a collage, produced for his funeral, that included a reproduction of the Twitter message from President Obama that made her son Zaevion posthumously famous. It declared him a hero at 15, and asked, Whats our excuse for not acting? on gun control legislation.Ms. Dobson ran some errands and then came home and opened the envelope. It was full of poems from University of Tennessee students she had never met, and their professor, the poet Marilyn Kallet, who wrote:I want to kill the bullet that Killed your son, Zenobia. Want to stop this madness.Ms. Dobson read the poems, and then she cried as if it were still Dec. 17. That evening last year, Zaevion, the youngest of her three sons and a promising high school football player, was shot in the chest a couple of blocks from home in what the police say was a retaliatory gang attack. Zaevion, the police said, was an innocent bystander with no gang affiliation. He died shielding two young women from the attackers.On Jan. 5, a few days after the presidents Twitter post, Mr. Obama mentioned Zaevion again in a tearful speech in which he proposed more vigorous gun-control legislation. The killing of this innocent teenager, he said, should allay any doubt as to why you should feel that fierce urgency of now.But that was not the feeling in Knoxville, the third-largest city in a state where there has been little political appetite for a new gun-control crusade.The Republican-controlled legislature here is one of the most gun-friendly in the nation. In February, it passed a resolution naming a semiautomatic weapon, the Barrett Model M82/M107, as the official state rifle. On Monday, Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, allowed a bill to become law that will allow faculty and staff members at public colleges and universities to be armed.The mayor of Knoxville, Madeline Rogero, a Democrat in a city with a strong Republican presence, has decided that Zaevions story would best serve as an argument for strengthening programs for at-risk youth, and addressing the root causes of gang violence.In an interview, Ms. Rogero, with what seemed like a mix of pride and exasperation, noted that she had been named as a defendant in two lawsuits challenging a city policy that banned firearms at the annual Tennessee Valley Fair. The National Rifle Association opposes the policy.When you make it just about guns, then you dont really get more to the root cause of why somebody takes up a gun, she said.The police chief, David Rausch, who joined the mayor for an interview at City Hall, agreed that it would be tricky to make the teenagers death a gun issue. Because then you polarize people, he said.And so, with guns off the table, the response to the killing in this city of 184,000 has played out instead with a focus on themes that do not polarize in the American heartland: a respect for chivalry, sacrifice, football and mothers who resolve to raise good sons.The state legislature has voted to name a freeway overpass for Zaevion, and at the Lonsdale Homes, a playground will be built and dedicated in his name. Fulton High School, where Zaevion, as a sophomore, played linebacker and fullback for a football program that has won numerous state championships, has created a scholarship named for him. A countywide Zaevion Dobson Day will be commemorated each Jan. 24, in honor of the number  24  that he wore on the field.Among the items in Ms. Dobsons living room is a citation of excellence presented by the Knoxville Police Department, extolling Zaevions heroic act of valor and bravery in giving his life by placing himself in grave danger to protect others.Ms. Dobson, 46, is a single mother who grew up in the same project where she raised her boys, encouraging their interest in sports and staying in close contact with their teachers. With the death of Zaevion, she has become something of a public figure. Strangers recognize her from the news. They just stop me at the mall and want to give me a hug, she said.The response, for many here, was an example of Knoxville at its best, transcending the dividing lines of partisanship, race and class. State Representative Eddie Smith, a Republican who represents Zaevions neighborhood, was instrumental in having the overpass named in his honor. His first thought was to jump on top of those girls and protect them, he said. What high school student would have thought to react that way?But Mr. Smith is among those who are adamant that gun control should not be part of the conversation. Criminals will always find a way, he said. Im a Christian, so I go back to Cain and Abel. It didnt involve a gun. It involved a rock.After burying her son, Ms. Dobson returned to her job at a meals-on-wheels program for the elderly. Her politics are no secret: A digitally altered image hanging in her kitchen shows Mr. Obama, Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. together, striking similarly pensive poses.She is grateful for the posthumous recognition Zaevion has earned, but frustrated that gun control is not part of the discussion. On April 16, Zaevions 12-year-old cousin, Jajuan Hubert Latham, was killed in an unrelated gang shootout that is under investigation.All I can do is just pray that one day theyll have a change of heart, she said of Tennessee lawmakers.Ms. Dobson has been following her sons case closely. Chief Rausch said that five people of interest had been picked up and questioned. None have been charged for the killing, though four are being held on other charges. The police have not released information about the weapons used, except to note that there was more than one.Last week, the mayor invited Ms. Dobson to the unveiling of the proposed city budget, which includes funding for a new recreation and jobs center for young people, and increased funding for an antiviolence program called Save Our Sons. Ms. Dobson could not attend. She had to work.But she did go, during her lunch break, to hear Ms. Kallet and her students at their poetry reading on Friday afternoon. They were poems of condolence, mostly, with hints of bewilderment and rage. Senseless shooting spree,  Ms. Kallets poem read, echoing the language of news reports,As if there could beA meaningful shootingSpree After reading, most of the poets approached Ms. Dobson and hugged her. She hugged them all back. And when they were done, she dried her tears, and made her way back to work."}
{"text": "LONDON  Adidas said on Wednesday that it was seeking to sell parts of its golf business including TaylorMade, one of the worlds best-known brands of golf equipment.The German sportswear maker began a strategic review last year of its golf business, announcing that it had hired an investment bank to explore options for the business, which has struggled in recent years to gain momentum.On Wednesday, Adidas, which is based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, said that its executive board had concluded the review and had decided to enter concrete negotiations with interested parties to sell parts of its golf division.Adidas said that it would actively seek a buyer for its TaylorMade, Adams and Ashworth brands and would instead focus on golf footwear and apparel sales through its Adidas golf brand.TaylorMade is a very viable business, Herbert Hainer, the Adidas chief executive, said in a news release. However, we decided that now is the time to focus even more on our core strength in the athletic footwear and apparel market.A final decision on selling the business, including any potential agreement, is subject to approval by Adidass supervisory board.TaylorMade was founded in 1979 by Gary Adams, a golf equipment salesman, and it was acquired by Adidas in 1997. Its clubs are carried by professional golfers including Justin Rose, Jason Day and Sergio Garca.As Adidas expanded its golf business, it acquired the Ashworth brand for $72.8 million, including debt, in 2008 and the Adams brand in 2012 for $70 million.The TaylorMade-Adidas Golf business posted sales of 1.34 billion euros, or about $1.5 billion, in 2012, but they have steadily declined in recent years. It posted sales of 902 million last year.In the first quarter of this year, Adidas said that revenue in its TaylorMade-Adidas Golf business decreased 1 percent on a currency neutral basis. The company said that growth at the core brands TaylorMade and Adidas Golf was more than offset by sales declines at Ashworth and Adams in the quarter."}
{"text": "PRAIA, Cape Verde  Some countries have oil, diamonds or cocoa beans. Cape Verde, a tiny archipelago about 385 miles off the west coast of Senegal, has music, and it is betting on that resource to help bolster its fragile economy.This month, music promoters and producers from the United States, Europe and some African nations landed in Praia, the countrys capital, for the Atlantic Music Expo, a four-day talent showcase that the government bills as a music professionals meeting. They attended seminars, networked and hopped from one stage to another, joining crowds of giggling teenagers, dancing elders and excited children to watch aspiring local and international singers.The Atlantic expo, which ran from April 11-14, was followed by the privately sponsored Kriol Jazz Festival, now in its eighth year, which promotes creole-inspired island music.Its essential to see people perform live before you book them, and there is nothing better than experiencing a music culture where its actually from, said Paula Abreu, the director of programming for SummerStage, an annual New York City music festival. You immediately know if an artist has what it takes to entertain a public of thousands.Ms. Abreu booked the musicians Mayra Andrade, Dino DSantiago and the Cesria vora Orchestra for last years SummerStage after seeing them at the Atlantic expo.The model for many Cape Verdean artists is the international star Cesria vora, who put Cape Verde on the map of the music world with her renditions of mornas, the islands ballads of love and longing.Here, from the rural areas to the breezy beach towns, everyone sings and has a beautiful voice, said Jos Da Silva, who developed the Kriol festival and is the producer of the Atlantic Music Expo. What matters is who works hard enough to be discovered.Mr. Da Silva, a music producer who helped to relaunch the career of Ms. vora in the 1980s, worked with the Cape Verde Ministry of Culture to create the Atlantic Music Expo, now in its fourth year. This year, the government spent about $227,000 to finance the expo, which also had corporate sponsors.Together, the two events attract thousands of fans and music professionals each year and pump more than $1 million into the islands economy each year, officials said.That is no small amount in Cape Verde, which became independent from Portugal in 1975. The youth unemployment rate is 36 percent, according to the national statistics office, and it is one of the few countries that has more diaspora citizens than locals: a population of about 500,000 on the islands but more than 700,000 abroad.When we became independent, all we had was people, said Abrao Vicente, the newly appointed culture minister and an artist and poet himself.Today, all we export is music, maybe because it was always the easiest art, added Mr. Vicente, whose wife is a prominent Cape Verdean singer who uses the name Lura. You dont need any material to sing.Mr. Vincente said one of his goals was to attract tourist dollars by staging musical events like the Atlantic expo across the islands. To finance these, Mr. Vicente plans to collaborate with international producers by offering space for their own festivals.But of course, he said, Cape Verdeans should be the ones involved, for those who dont have a stage to find one.Last years breakout star was Elida Almeida. Scouted by programmers from France, the United States and Africa at the music expo, the 23-year-old from a mountainous village on the main island of Santiago has since toured the United States, Canada and is now performing in major African cities.Ms. Almeidas song Nta Konsigui has been used as the soundtrack for a Portuguese telenovela and her videos have received almost two million views on YouTube.I feel privileged to have gone so far in so little time, Ms. Almeida said in a Skype interview from Cotonou, Benin, where she was performing. My objective is now to take Cape Verdean music as far as possible.Empty of human life before their discovery by the Portuguese during the 15th century, the Cape Verdean islands were an early center for the shipment of slaves from the West African coast to the Americas.We are positioned in the middle of the Atlantic, right between the African continent and the Americas, so we were at the cross point, both culturally and physically, said Charles Akibod, a historian who was instrumental in getting Cidade Velha, one of the first settlements for transcontinental slavery, designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site.For Helio Batalha, a 27-year-old hip-hop artist who performed at the music expo, that blending of cultures and history has led to a form of identity crisis for young Cape Verdeans. We are told we are African, but we dont know much about the continent, Mr. Batalha said, sitting outside his uncles tiny storefront in Ponta dAgua, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Praia.He said the music expo had allowed him to meet producers and programmers, but nothing is booked for now. There is a fantasy that after A.M.E., you get handed a plane ticket, he said. Lets wait and see.Not every Cape Verdean thinks the festivals are a worthy investment.There are problems that could be solved with those amounts of money, said Mirto Cesar, a 40-year-old unemployed electrician in Praia with two children. There is real misery here, drugs, crimes, hunger. Misery music cant solve.Nonetheless, Mr. Cesar said he would still take his children to hear afternoon performances on the towns main square.Dont get me wrong, it is part of their culture, he said.At 4 a.m. on the Saturday of the Kriol festival, Praia was still resonating with music. The crowd had moved to a seaside stage overlooking the Kebra Kanela beach. Up to play was a Cape Verde jazz veteran, Teofilo Chantre, known for having been a composer and musician with Cesaria Evora many years ago. He had never played so late, he admitted, and for this concert he had decided to ask musicians from the younger generation to accompany him.On stage, Mr. Chantres languid, nostalgic voice seemed ignited by a different energy. Afterward, he seemed pleased with the collaboration, conceding he probably now had more to learn from the young players than they could from him.Music matters so much because we were always isolated here, he said. Its what reconnected us, it put us on the map."}
{"text": "When Michael Pomeranc was growing up in the mid-1960s in Rego Park, Queens, his parents and their friends spent countless evenings discussing their harrowing experiences in World War II. All were survivors of the Holocaust, and Mr. Pomeranc often saw them chain-smoking and crying late into the night. The absence of anything tangible from their histories plagued him most.Not having the ability to understand where everybody went was very, very traumatizing, Mr. Pomeranc, 58, a prominent New York City hotelier, said recently as he sat in the lobby of his hotel, Sixty SoHo. What happened to the cemeteries of my great-grandparents? Where are my grandparents and my aunts? Can you go there? Would you see anything? It was like they were talking in an abyss.The Pomeranc family is well known in New York real estate circles. Jack Pomeranc came to America after the war and amassed a fortune building residential properties and airport hotels, mostly in New Jersey. Now 88, he still spends most days commuting from his Fifth Avenue apartment to his office in Fort Lee. His sons Larry, Michael and Jason, the youngest and a frequent presence in the style pages, built up a national chain of celebrity-friendly boutique hotels.But the past was always with them, particularly for Michael, who spent nearly three decades working to uncover the fate of his murdered relatives, last seen in Adampol, a Polish agricultural town near Belarus. In the 1990s, he began searching historic records and tracking down leads across Europe. It was not until this year, when Caroline Sturdy Colls, a forensic archaeologist he had hired, completed three years of research, that his efforts led him back to Adampol.In January, Dr. Sturdy Colls, an associate professor of forensic archaeology and genocide investigation at Staffordshire University in England, published the first full-scale investigation of Adampol. According to her findings, as many as 1,000 Jewish victims are buried there in mass graves, beneath farmland, woodland, rubbish heaps and a shooting range. Because of Mr. Pomeranc, efforts are now underway to erect a monument and protect the site from development.Adampol is significant, said Paul Shapiro, the director of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. To really know  not to guess  where these sites are is huge. And of course that poses the question: Once we know, what will the world do about it?In recent years, researchers have uncovered a vast network of more than 42,000 relatively unknown Nazi camps and ghettos, many of which were behind the Iron Curtain or had few surviving eyewitnesses who could tell their stories. Most of the sites remain unmarked, neglected and poorly documented. Attempts to mark these areas are increasing, and are also often controversial.The reality is that today, in some little town, someone decides to build a supermarket and when they go to dig, they find human remains, Mr. Shapiro said. Unless something is done, you have the prospect of the remains of the victims of the Holocaust simply strewn across the European continent, and ultimately, built on top of.Preserving an area for remembrance can be a complex process that necessitates cooperation from local authorities and the Polish government. The chief rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich, who must also sign off, is currently reviewing the Adampol findings.It is not only in the Pomeranc family that Adampol looms large. Survivors settled in various countries, including Britain, Canada and Israel, and many have since reconnected via Facebook and other online outlets.Adampol was a horrible catastrophe, and yet no one has ever heard of it, said Helen Maryles Shankman, who lives in Teaneck, N.J.She turned her mothers stories of surviving Adampol as a child into several fictionalized retellings, including In the Land of Armadillos, her most recent book, published this year by Scribner.For Arie Hochberg, who was born just after the war in Lublin, a town to the south of Adampol, the discovery offers a flicker of hope. It is very possible that my grandmother and aunts and uncles were buried there, said Mr. Hochberg, who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.His mother, Anna Yuchtman, was a 20-year-old nurse when the war broke out and survived by escaping to Russia. She returned after the war to discover just one sister still alive. The rest of her family disappeared, said Mr. Hochberg, who runs a business importing Israeli wines and sits on the board of the Blue Card, a Holocaust organization. Until her death in 2004, she didnt know where or how they died.Adampol featured a landed estate owned by a Polish prince, which was converted during the war into a slave labor camp. Jews worked the estates fields and slept in its barns and stables. At first, Jews from the surrounding areas flocked to Adampol, driven by the mistaken notion that it would be safer than staying in the towns and ghettos where executions and deportation to the nearby Sobibor death camp were increasingly common. Like many others, the Pomeranc family, including Jack, his parents and five of his siblings, sought refuge there (an older sister, Chaja, had earlier fled to Belarus).Adampol turned out to be far from the safe haven the Pomeranc family had hoped. The conditions of the camp were undeniably harsh, with endless hours of manual labor and meager food rations. The constant threat of mass shootings was most terrifying.We were afraid every minute of every day, Jack Pomeranc said. Every few months there were shootings. We never knew when. They would suddenly appear and everyone would try running and hiding. We were lucky the woods were nearby.In those woods, which were large and deep and still border the town of Adampol, hid a ragtag group of Jewish partisan fighters. The young men and women, starving and poorly armed, raided farmhouses in search of food and supplies and conducted missions to free fellow Jews. Jack and his older brother Jurek often sneaked out of the camp and stayed with the partisans.In September 1943, Jurek and his cousin returned to Adampol for Abram, Jacks 8-year-old brother. Before the boys could return to the woods, another mass shooting began. They scrambled to safety but their parents and two youngest sisters, who were probably ages 3 and 4, were shot and thrown into shallow graves.Jack, his brothers and their sole surviving sister, Cesia, remained in the forest with the partisans for the rest of the war. Death was always near. In one instance, Jack was shot in the back during a raid, and he hid in a dirt hole for weeks while Cesia tried healing him with salves made from leaves.Jack survived the war, but those he lost were never far from his mind. We were not the typical American family, said Michael Pomeranc, who recounted the family stories Jack had told him. When my father came home from work and would see all of us around the dinner table, he would get very emotional. We lived two lives  the public life and the private one.To provide a modicum of healing for his father and some resolution for himself, Mr. Pomeranc set out to uncover as much as he could about the family. He searched for birth certificates, school papers and other personal documents. He hired researchers to interview townspeople in Adampol and villages where his family lived before the war. He offered rewards  no questions asked  if they returned items that had once belonged to Jews. He unearthed a few photographs, but nothing more.Then Mr. Pomeranc hired Dr. Sturdy Colls, who had conducted similar research at Treblinka, a Nazi extermination camp in Poland. Because Jewish law forbids disturbing the dead, archaeological excavations of Holocaust sites is not possible. Instead, she combed through thousands of pages of postwar trials, witness testimonies and government papers, unearthing stories of camp life and the murders that occurred there.She visited Adampol, hoping to spot evidence with her naked eye, and was successful: Next to one of the buildings someone had dug a pit for a drain pipe and in the soil there were burned bone fragments that were quite easy to see, and you could see there were additional bones, so it was likely they were scattered, she said.Dr. Sturdy Colls also employed advanced technologies like light detection and ranging, or lidar, which shoots pulsed-laser beams from sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites to measure the height of the ground surface, and produced detailed three-dimensional maps. She uncovered several large depressions indicating mass graves and one area where the graves were perfectly aligned in straight rows. I think there could be in the region of 800 to 1,000 mass graves, but it could be more, she said.While Dr. Sturdy Colls has finished her report, Mr. Pomeranc would like her to go back to Adampol to uncover more definitive proof of the grave sites. But first they must obtain Rabbi Schudrichs approval.People wonder, why dig so deep into this past? Mr. Pomeranc said. The truth is, we never left the past. Weve never entirely been able to leave the death camps, and the partisans and the forests behind."}
{"text": "Going through airport security, which has never been pleasant, is becoming a hellish experience as wait times increase around the country, in some cities to several hours.Security lines have gotten longer in part because more Americans are flying and government spending on security has not kept up with that growth. Passenger traffic was up nearly 5 percent, to 807 million trips, in the 12 months that ended in January, according to the Department of Transportation. But the number of authorized employees in the Transportation Security Administrations airport security operation is down nearly 3 percent from the 2015 fiscal year.In fact, the number of screeners has fallen every year since 2013. And even though the needs are growing, the Obama administration has asked Congress for a modest addition of only 323 positions, or less than a 1 percent increase in staffing, for the 2017 fiscal year.On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security, of which the T.S.A. is a part, appeared to act with more urgency. It said that the government would hire more airport screeners and increase the number of bomb-sniffing dogs. Money for these measures will come from other parts of the T.S.A. budget, but the department and Congress need to do more.Congress authorized $4.15 billion for the T.S.A.s airport screening operation in 2016, up just $37 million from the year before. Thats clearly inadequate, given the increase in passengers. In addition to more money, the T.S.A. needs greater flexibility to increase spending when demand for air travel surges. For example, Congress should allow the department to tap into more of the money the government collects from a security tax levied on tickets when traffic grows faster than projected. In the past, Congress has diverted some of that revenue to the general fund.The security agency can also reduce wait times by making smart adjustments that dont require congressional action. One step, suggested by a trade association representing airports, is to give local T.S.A. managers the power to spend more money on overtime during busy periods without consulting headquarters.The agency also needs to get more passengers to sign up for the PreCheck program, which allows those who have been preapproved by the T.S.A. to go through security without removing their shoes and belts or taking laptop computers out of bags. That reduces wait times for everybody by cutting the number of people in the main security line.The T.S.A. has set a goal of signing up 25 million passengers to PreCheck in the next three years. So far, it  has registered only 2.5 million, though officials say enrollment is picking up. The Department of Homeland Security has signed up 6.5 million people in other trusted travelers programs, like Global Entry; those people are also eligible for PreCheck. The T.S.A. might be able to encourage more sign-ups if it reduced the $85 registration fee, which is good for five years.The recent terrorist attack in Brussels showed that airports remain a big target, and agencies like the T.S.A. have a difficult job. It was heavily criticized last year after an investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security revealed that airport security workers often failed to detect weapons, mock explosives and other prohibited items. Travel experts say some of the steps the agency took in response probably contributed to the increased wait times.Clearly, safety cant be compromised to reduce wait times. But there is no doubt that the T.S.A. and Congress can do a lot more to make screening more efficient and a better experience for travelers."}
{"text": "Republican elected officials, donors and strategists grappled uncomfortably on Wednesday with the inevitability of Donald J. Trump as their presidential nominee, an unexpectedly sudden denouement that left many in a state of political paralysis and others vowing to oppose the partys new standard-bearer.While some called for unity, many Republican leaders refrained from falling in line behind Mr. Trump, with dozens avoiding inquiries about where they stood or saying they wanted Mr. Trump to detail his policies or tone down his language first. Others tied themselves in knots as they praised and criticized Mr. Trump in a single breath, or suggested that they could abide Mr. Trump but loathed his agenda.Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is in a tough re-election race, signaled that she would support Mr. Trump but not endorse him, as a spokeswoman put it, a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately. Representative Ral R. Labrador of Idaho, a staunch conservative, said he would support Mr. Trump but derided him for not knowing much about the Constitution or politics. Former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida, who retains a strong network of donors, said he would raise money for Mr. Trump but was unsure about his proposals, like temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States.For a party that usually rallies around its presumptive nominee quickly, the brutal primary campaign and the questions about Mr. Trumps substance and style have fueled a remarkable level of dissatisfaction  antipathy that will not fade simply because Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have ceded the race to him.The journey from denial and resistance to grudging acceptance, and even peace, with the Trump nomination may never be complete for some Republicans. But leaders hope to change that quickly, to save the party from splintering and to have a real shot at winning in November.There will be some that will take days and weeks to realize that there are two choices and that its between Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee, which most of us believe will be Hillary Clinton, said Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Mr. Bryant, who supported Mr. Cruz, called on him and others to back Mr. Trump. Realistically, and I think Republicans are realists, this is an opportunity to have a Republican president sitting in the Oval Office, he said.But Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a veteran House member and Republican strategist, said he was counseling his colleagues in competitive races to be coldblooded about how they approach their nominee.Position yourself in the way you think is best for you, he said, allowing that it is difficult for some members.I know a lot of Republicans who are in red-leaning districts in blue states who see Trump as more helpful to them than they would have Cruz, Mr. Cole said, citing Representative Elise Stefanik, who represents a sprawling district in upstate New York. But if youre in a heavily Hispanic district, your calculation is very different.Mr. Trumps achievement also drew a rebuke of sorts from the last two Republican presidents. Aides to former Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush said they would not participate in or comment on the presidential campaign. By contrast, they supported the Republican nominees in the last two elections: John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. Mr. Trump ran a sharply negative campaign against former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the son of the elder Mr. Bush and brother of the younger, who dropped out in February.For some in the party, the question of whether to embrace Mr. Trump is not merely an intellectual exercise. Some staff members at the Republican National Committee were told Wednesday that if they were unable to get behind the nominee, they should leave by the end of the week.Representative Peter T. King of New York, whose Long Island district Mr. Trump won overwhelmingly in the April 19 primary, echoed other Republicans in pledging to vote for Mr. Trump even though he had reservations, calling Mr. Trump a guy with no knowledge of whats going on.As far as any involvement or campaigning, its really going to depend on him filling in the gaps and consolidating his policies, Mr. King said. Right now, theres no real coherence.The lingering resistance to Mr. Trump is especially strong in some of the states and congressional districts with hotly contested races this year. Representative Carlos Curbelo, who is from a competitive district in South Florida and has been outspoken about his refusal to support Mr. Trump, said Hispanics in his district were furious at Mr. Trump over his inflammatory language about Latinos.Resentment is a kind way of putting it, Mr. Curbelo said. People are offended and really incredulous. He added that he would consider supporting a third-party presidential candidate, though that option did not appear to have much support among other Republicans on Wednesday.But the widespread discomfort and anxiety about Mr. Trump was utterly clear in the hours after he became the presumptive nominee on Tuesday night. Most leading Republicans were publicly silent. And the dearth of congratulatory news releases and Twitter posts spoke volumes.Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet; others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or too busy to email, call or release a statement.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said in a news release issued after 7 p.m. Wednesday that Mr. Trump had the opportunity and the obligation to unite our party around our goals.Democrats were gleeful: Mrs. Clintons campaign issued a list of more than 40 conservatives denouncing Mr. Trumps success, among them Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, who said Wednesday that he would not vote for Mr. Trump. (A spokeswoman later said Mr. Baker would not vote for Mrs. Clinton, either.)Some of the biggest Republican donors were warily eyeing Mr. Trump on Wednesday. Associates of the billionaire Paul E. Singer and of the Ricketts family, both of whom helped finance the failed Stop Trump efforts, said they were still evaluating the race.While most donors and Republican leaders had become resigned to the probability that Mr. Trump would be their nominee, the withdrawals of Mr. Cruz on Tuesday night and Mr. Kasich on Wednesday forced them to face up sooner than expected to a question they had been dreading.A ton of Republicans are waking up this morning  and I know because weve already chatted  and many are saying, Im not getting in this mess,  said Gregory W. Slayton, a top Republican fund-raiser who remains adamantly opposed to Mr. Trump. Some are saying, Well, Im going to have to back Trump, and of course many are saying, I dont know what Im going to do. Two influential Republican groups, the Club for Growth and the Republican Jewish Coalition, said they planned to focus on helping House and Senate candidates this fall and on keeping both chambers under Republican control, rather than making the presidency their top priority.William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said the hostility toward Mr. Trump could be damaging if the Republican convention this summer gets out of hand or if his unusually high negative ratings end up hurting other Republicans on the ticket.I think people are underestimating the degree to which you could see a crisis in the Republican Party, he said.Still, in some quarters, reconciliation between Mr. Trump and his onetime critics is underway. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump before dropping out of the presidential race, has had multiple phone conversations with him recently, according to Republicans close to Mr. Trump. (Aides to Mr. Rubio declined to comment.)And Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who supported Mr. Rubio and had castigated Mr. Trump at times, issued a statement Wednesday reiterating that she would support the Republican nominee for president. A spokesman for Ms. Haley said she and Mr. Trump had not spoken.Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi who supported Mr. Kasich, said he thought more Republicans would come around to Mr. Trump once they appreciated his appeal among conservative Democrats and independents, as well as among Republicans who do not traditionally vote.The thing about Trump is, he has been turning out historic numbers, even in my state here, Mr. Lott said. I talk to some labor union people in my hometown, theyre for Trump."}
{"text": "On a warm spring evening, James Lee sat drinking a gin and tonic on the balcony of the apartment he shares with two roommates in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He had the night off from his job as a server at a Manhattan restaurant, and he was talking about the high cost of living in New York and what its like to have roommates at his age (33).Thats when one of the men he lives with, Andrew Rosenthal, stepped outside. What do you want for dinner? Mr. Rosenthal asked. Do you want me to make the baked ziti?No, Mr. Lee said. You put way too much salt in the baked ziti.Dude, salt is amazing, Mr. Rosenthal said. Gandhi almost freed India because of salt. You just want to order in?Yes, Mr. Lee said. Once his roommate was gone, Mr. Lee added, This is going to be a very expensive dinner.The two had not had a meal together for a while because Mr. Lee works nights and spends much of his free time with his girlfriend, Rachael Field, a vocational counselor in Brooklyn Criminal Court. Ms. Field happens to be Mr. Rosenthals best friend from childhood. In recent months, Mr. Lee had been pressing Ms. Field about moving in together.Theres definitely part of me that thinks, Im almost 34 and I still have two roommates, Mr. Lee said. Its out of economic necessity. I would do anything for my girlfriend and me to have our own place together.A bit later, while waiting for dinner to arrive, Mr. Rosenthal, a 34-year-old clinical coordinator at a homeless shelter, pointed out his contributions to the living space: the art on the walls, the tomato plants on the balcony, the compost heap.James is the definition of a nice person, Mr. Rosenthal said of his roommate. He doesnt ask the hard questions, which is frustrating, but hes a kind, generous person.Even so, the roommate life is not always ideal. If you asked me 10 years ago if this was going to be my life, I would have slit my wrists, Mr. Rosenthal said. But I have made it, to the best of my ability, the life that I wanted. Im going to build a life for myself and not compromise, and Im not going to wait around for a woman to mature me, which is what Ive seen with so many guys.Mr. Rosenthal is not alone in hanging on to a living arrangement more typical for people in their 20s. Data on the living arrangements of Americans from the ages of 18 to 44 suggests that nonfamily households have become more common in recent years, and a United States Census Bureau study, taking a broader view, also reported an increase, to 6.1 percent from 1.7 percent, from 1970 to 2012.For all that, Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University, noted that, for men, living with nonfamily members was not unusual long ago.Theres a long tradition of men living with something like roommates, Dr. Klinenberg said. Men used to live in boardinghouses quite commonly. You had places like the old Y.M.C.A.s. These were really significant parts of the housing stock a century ago. They have since become far less common.These days, adult men living with roommates are the outliers. I think its flipped, Dr. Klinenberg said. Theres much less of a stigma being a 40-year-old man living alone than being a 40-year-old man living with a male roommate. Living alone has become far more viable. A hundred years ago, that would have been completely different.To be part of any household  whether with a partner or spouse, other family members, or roommates  means giving up the freedoms that go with the living-alone life.But it can also ward off loneliness. And the almost constant presence of others is something that Sam Jackson, 35, likes about having roommates. Growing up in Houston, he was part of a family with 10 children, and he never had the chance to feel alone. Nor did he want to.There are moments where Im not super-social, and I just go to my room and shut the door, said Mr. Jackson, a lawyer for a city trade union. But theres something comforting about knowing that theres someone possibly in the living room.I could ask one of the guys, if it was a Wednesday night, Hey, do you want to go out and get a drink? With your other friends, you have to call them and you have to meet somewhere, whereas, sitting here with a roommate, you can say, Dude, youre not doing anything, either, and all you have to do is go to a bar.He was seated on a couch that has seen better days. On the walls of the apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that he shares with two other men were mirrored advertisements for beer brands. A row of dusty basketballs occupied a nearby shelf. When this place cleans up, its a looker, Mr. Jackson said.Some people may say he is living out a prolonged adolescence.If someone were to use that as a description of me and how I live my life, I would be totally O.K. with that, Mr. Jackson said. I like being perceived as young and living as a responsible adult. If I were in Pittsburgh, I would just run out of stuff to do. Your peer group would be paired off  seriously paired off. I think if I were in Houston or any other city, it would probably be a lot harder to live a prolonged adolescence.Jeremy Owens, too, likes having other people around, even at 41. He rents out a room of the apartment he owns in the Bronx, a place he once shared with his wife, to the 24-year-old sister of a previous roommate.After his divorce, Mr. Owens, who teaches middle school math, lived in this apartment with two other men. He took the living room for himself and put up bookshelves as a divider. His current roommate is about to move out, which has left him at something of a real estate crossroads.I was talking to a friend of mine, trying to figure out what to do with the place, and he said, If you want to, come live with us, Mr. Owens said. Hes in late 20s, and Id be one of four. The other guys are 26, 28, 31. Then, 41. We all get along, but one of these things is not like the other.Mr. Owens recalled that when his marriage ended, he found himself out of step with men his age.When you first arrive here in your late 20s, you have tons of people in the same situation youre in, he said. But now you ask yourself: Am I going to live a 20-year-old life or a 30-year-old life? Am I supposed to be doing that at my age?Jon Derengowski, 31, a television script coordinator, found himself in a similar situation after a breakup. Now he lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where he has lived with nine different people since 2008. But one of those people was his longtime boyfriend. When the relationship ended, after a year and a half, he had to replace his partner with a stranger who could help with the rent.Maybe its not depression, but theres definitely a bit of self-criticism that sets in, Mr. Derengowski said of the period after his boyfriends departure. Youve hit this very defined point on the trajectory that most people agree is the right thing to be doing, and then youre not there anymore.Even though he gets along with his roommates, Mr. Derengowski said he does not necessarily want to see someone sitting on the couch when he gets home from work.I have a routine, he said. If I just want to come home and check out and open a bottle of wine, I dont want to feel obligated to include somebody else. The worst thing is when you walk in the door and youve got $30 of groceries in your hand and somebodys got every pot and pan going in the kitchen, and you go, Ugh. So what do you do? You wait an hour or give up and go to a restaurant.Joe Tobal, 35, a bartender who writes fiction, has had roommates most of his adult life. At the moment, he shares an apartment in Astoria, Queens, with two women in their 20s. But having recently come into some family money, he is about to move out on his own.I am so excited, Mr. Tobal said. If I wake up in my boxers, I want to be able to walk in the kitchen and grab a glass of water.He added that he feels as if he has lived in what he called a subset of adulthood. He pays his bills and college loans on time, he owns a car and he isnt having ramen for dinner. But, as a bartender, he is often out long after midnight.Its certainly not a lifestyle I want to be in another 10 years, Mr. Tobal said. I dont want to be that guy, the guy whos 45, 50 years old, whos trying to pick up girls every night. I hope to God thats not the path the Lord has set me on. Having his own place, he said, feels like moving forward.Of his life now, he added, This has been a fun vacation for a little while, but its not sustainable.Not long after my first interviews with Mr. Lee and Mr. Rosenthal at the apartment they shared in Crown Heights, their living arrangement was about to change. Mr. Lee and his girlfriend, Ms. Field, had decided to move in together.To be precise, Ms. Field is the one who made the final decision. Like Mr. Lee, she was living with two roommates. But when faced with renewing her lease, she decided to act on the thing he had been asking her about for a long time. She called him and simply told him it was time.Were both looking forward to having our own space, Ms. Field said. Theres a higher degree of ownership and permanence, at least for me. It feels a little more grown-up.Because of their work schedules, it turned out that she was the one to tell her longtime friend (and Mr. Lees roommate) Mr. Rosenthal. The first conversation did not go well, Ms. Field said, but she understood. After all, Mr. Rosenthal was losing not only a solid roommate, but also a friend.Making it trickier for Mr. Rosenthal was the fact that Mr. Lee would be building a new life with his best friend from childhood. And now he will have to start the search for a new roommate.Its always stressful, Mr. Rosenthal said, after learning that things were about to change. Its always not a pleasant experience. Youre always trying to find someone who can be an adult, for lack of a better term."}
{"text": "Will(Dead Oceans)Opposite tendencies can develop in culture at the same time. Look in one direction, and you see complex thought compressed into 140 characters, high-resolution video and audio, the sharpening of the pop-song hook: a process of individuation, definition, concision. Look in another direction, and the waters are rising. A song is a mixtape is an album is a video is a Soundcloud or a YouTube stream; no format seems to have primacy. Length and repetition arent a problem. Blurriness, in sound and meaning, may be a plus.Julianna Barwicks music belongs to the oceanic category. Her songs are built of short-cycle vocal lines, singing for the feeling, singing for the sound. Theyre echoed and stacked, with indistinct words, and the instrumental aspects of the music sound like voices, too: continuous tones in repeating patterns. The effect is churchly and vaguely Renaissance, but also very now.On Will, her third full-length solo studio album, Ms. Barwick is working with only a few others: the singer Thomas Arsenault, who performs as Mas Ysa; the cellist Maarten Vos; and the percussionist Jamie Ingalls, from Chairlift, among other bands.Being part of a larger tendency  which could be called ambient music but is really the echoed-and-repeated-vocal subcategory thereof  Ms. Barwick has been cheerful in interviews about the artists shes compared to. Sometimes its Brian Eno. (On this record, Big Hollow, with its single-note piano line, recalls his early ambient records from the late 70s.) Often its Grouper, Liz Harriss one-woman project.In a few recent interviews, Ms. Barwick has brought up an analogy made by a writer some years ago: she as the white witch of this kind of music, Ms. Harris as the dark witch. Those terms kind of work, especially for Will, which may be Ms. Barwicks most conventionally light, soothing record, and is sometimes a little inert as a result. (I get fuller contemplation out of The Magic Place and Nepenthe, although comparing them feels like comparing the sensation of swimming underwater in different lakes. And the presence of See, Know, the final song on Will, changes the records sum effect: It uses live drums and a faster cycle of synthesizer notes, building a crescendo, verging on a dance track.)In general, Ms. Harriss work is full of irresolution. It connotes loss and even erasure. By comparison, Ms. Barwicks is consonant and genial. It connotes fulfillment and presence. Whom you prefer comes down to which disposition you want to spend your time with."}
{"text": "FLINT, Mich.  The Flint city worker who was one of three people charged last month in connection with the citys water crisis, has agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for reduced charges.The city employee, Michael Glasgow, Flints laboratory and water quality supervisor, had been charged with tampering with lead testing reports, a felony punishable by five years in jail, and with willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor.On Wednesday, prosecutors threw out the tampering charge and Mr. Glasgow pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor on the condition that he continue to cooperate with state and federal investigators, who have said that more arrests in relation to the crisis are on the way.A deal for Mr. Glasgows cooperation was widely anticipated. His arrest came as a surprise to some, as he had voiced concerns over the decision to switch the citys water supply to the Flint River from Lake Huron in 2014. When no corrosion controls were added after the switch at Flints water treatment plant, pipes started leaching lead, poisoning much of the citys water.The deal came with conditions. Judge Jennifer Manley of Genesee District Court said the court would revisit the agreement every three months to make sure that Mr. Glasgow is holding up his end of the bargain. Robert Harrison, Mr. Glasgows lawyer, called the arrangement unusual but said Mr. Glasgow was pleased to contribute to the investigation.Todd Flood, special counsel for the states investigation into the Flint water crisis, said its possible that all charges could be dropped after one year. He has to fulfill the conditions, Mr. Flood said.Mr. Flood declined to comment on what information Mr. Glasgow could contribute to further investigations. When asked how crucial Mr. Glasgows cooperation was, he said, I wouldnt have done it if it wasnt.A hearing on Wednesday for the other people arrested so far, two state Department of Environmental Quality workers, was postponed."}

{"text": "OTTAWA  Walls of flame driven by strong, shifting winds raged out of control on Wednesday in and around the evacuated city of Fort McMurray, Alberta, where firefighters were helpless to stop the destruction and where about 88,000 people had fled their homes.To date, the fire has resisted all suppression efforts, Bernie Schmidt, an Alberta forestry official, told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday. This is a very complex fire, with multiple fronts and explosive conditions.Rachel Notley, the premier of the province, said that at least 1,600 buildings had been destroyed. No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the danger was far from over.This is a really dirty fire, Darby Allen, the regional fire chief for the area, said on the conference call. There are certainly areas within the city which have not been burned, but this fire will look for them, and it will take them.The entire population of Fort McMurray, the main center for Canadas oil sands region, was ordered to evacuate on Tuesday evening once the fire, which began in woodlands outside the city, had overwhelmed firefighters efforts to hold it at bay. Cars and trucks jammed the only route out of the city, Highway 63, which runs north to the oil-sands work camps and south to Edmonton, the nearest sizable city, 270 miles away.As the road became gridlocked, it took motorists five hours or longer to cover 12 miles to evacuation centers at the work camps. And southbound travel was impossible for several hours on Tuesday when flames blocked the highway. Some motorists took to Highway 63s grassy median and even drove the wrong way on the opposite side in hopes of escaping the city faster.Jasmin Herold, a German filmmaker who has lived in Fort McMurray for the last two years, had a harrowing time getting out. Like many in the city, she said she thought the worst of the fire had passed when Tuesday dawned bright and sunny. But when the smoke returned in midafternoon, she gathered up her dog, her notes, laptop and hard drives with documentary footage and jumped into a small Toyota sedan with her boyfriend, Michael Beamish.Getting from her neighborhood to Highway 63, normally a two-minute drive, took an hour and a half, Ms. Herold said in an interview, and all the while through the back, I saw the flames reaching for our area. Highway 63 was jam-packed, so they tried local roads to get to the south end of town, and found themselves driving through a tunnel of fire.It was hot in the car, very hot  I thought maybe this was it for us, she said. With little choice, they pressed on, she said, and finally went up a hill and into sunshine again.The southbound highway was littered with abandoned cars, trucks and buses. The evacuation had drained Fort McMurray of gasoline, and many motorists ran out of fuel in the clog of traffic fleeing the city. The jams had cleared by Wednesday afternoon, and gasoline tanker trucks began patrolling the highway to refuel stranded vehicles.Hundreds of firefighters were in Fort McMurray on Wednesday, with more on the way, but many of them were standing by, waiting for a chance to go into action. Helicopters and airplanes dropped water and chemical suppressants, but the speed of the fires progress and frequent shifts in its direction have so far made it too dangerous to tackle it from the ground, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the provincial government.As the fire spread into the city, reporters and witnesses said, the sound of exploding propane tanks filled the air. The downtown business district of Fort McMurray was still largely undamaged on Wednesday, but several businesses on its fringes were destroyed, including a gas station and a hotel, and there were signs that the fire was once again headed its way.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday that he had pledged the national governments total support for the firefighting efforts, aid for evacuees and other needs during a telephone call with Ms. Notley, the premier, who flew to Fort McMurray on Wednesday. Mr. Trudeau said offers of support from local governments across Canada had been pouring in as well.Canada is a country where we look out for our neighbors, Mr. Trudeau said in Ottawa, where he was meeting with lawmakers of his party.The defense minister, Harjit Sajjan, told reporters on a conference call that the military was prepared to offer whatever assistance was requested. Alberta is home to several large military bases.Most of Fort McMurrays oil sands operations are north of the city and well outside the likely path of the fire. Ian D. Gates, chairman of the department of petroleum engineering at the University of Calgary, said that it was unlikely that the oil sands deposits underground would be affected, but that the bitumen in oil sands already at the surface, exposed by mining or erosion, might burn if a sufficiently hot wildfire were to reach them.Thousands of oil sands workers live in other parts of Canada and commute by air to the region for a few weeks work at a time, sleeping in company-owned or leased work camps between shifts. Several oil companies shut down or curtailed operations and flew employees out to make room in their camps for evacuees.The citys airport remained open on Wednesday, but only for a limited number of departing civilian flights. Military aircraft arrived carrying emergency personnel and supplies. WestJet, a major Canadian airline, brought in aircraft on Tuesday to evacuate more than 100 patients from Fort McMurrays hospital.Ms. Stewart, the provincial spokeswoman, said the immediate cause of the fire, which started over the weekend, was still unknown. But she added that the winter and spring had been unusually dry and warm, parching the forests that surround the city. The weather this week has been unseasonably hot, with temperatures on Tuesday reaching about 90 degrees Fahrenheit  rare in Fort McMurray even at the peak of summer  with relative humidity of just 13 percent.Fire and emergency services officials said that shifting winds and continued high temperatures could increase the size of the fire, which covered about 25,000 acres on Wednesday morning. Satellite thermal images showed that the fire jumped a river on Wednesday and was curling back toward downtown Fort McMurray, on one hand, and toward the citys airport and an industrial park on the other. Firefighters spent Tuesday night clearing fire breaks near the industrial park and airport, but the intensity of the fire made it unclear whether those efforts would have any success.Ms. Notley, the provincial premier, said that officials were holding off on flooding the area with assistance until the shape of the fire becomes clearer and the weather turns cooler, which may help make the fire less destructive.Your first thought is to say: Get more people, get more stuff, go, go, go,  Ms. Notley said, but that approach could cause added danger and hamper firefighting work by clogging the citys small airport. Instead, she said, the province has been concentrating on sending specially trained firefighters and specialized equipment in from other parts of the province.David Martell, a professor in the Fire Management Systems Laboratory of the University of Toronto, said that large forest fires are effectively impossible to fight in hot, dry conditions, because they can shoot out flames more than a mile ahead of their fronts. All that crews can do right now, he said, is prepare plans and resources to really go in and hammer it when the weather changes."}

{"text": "At first, not everyone thought that the art fair Frieze New York was such a great idea, given its location on the seldom-traveled Randalls Island in the East River.There was a certain amount of skepticism among dealers, said Fergus McCaffrey, proprietor of an eponymous gallery in the art-dense New York neighborhood of Chelsea. Would people travel to Randalls Island?They would, and they did. Frieze New York returns for its fifth edition on Thursday and runs until Sunday, featuring 202 galleries from 31 countries.I was one of the skeptics, but I was quickly converted, said Mr. McCaffrey, who started showing at the fair in its second edition and this year devotes his booth to the work of the post-Minimalist sculptor Richard Nonas.The success of Frieze New York can be attributed to its points of difference  fine-food offerings and a serpentine, unusually light-filled tent  but also some basic market factors.We all chase our tails from one art fair to another, but the heart of the matter is that New York, and America, are the absolute center of the commercial art world, Mr. McCaffrey said.Victoria Siddall, formerly the director of Frieze Masters, which is based in London and takes place in the autumn, has taken over as the director of Frieze New York for the first time this year. She said the fair had been expanding its focus beyond just fresh-off-the-easel contemporary pieces.We have been bringing in the blue-chip, New York galleries, Ms. Siddall said. Last year, we added Acquavella Galleries and Per Skarstedt, and they were showing Dubuffets and Picassos, which we hadnt seen before. And there was a lot of demand for that. Two newcomers, Dominique Levy Gallery and Mitchell Inness & Nash, will be beefing up the blue-chip lineup this year.Larger changes include a tweak in the fairs layout. The galleries in the Focus section, all less than a dozen years old, were previously scattered, but are now gathered in one place to create a destination, Ms. Siddall said.A new publication, Frieze Week, is also being introduced. It will include information on fair offerings as well as other cultural happenings around town in May.The dealers on hand have the challenge posed by every art fair: how to fit in, while also remaining distinct.P.P.O.W., based in New York and back for its third round in the main section, will feature what its co-founder, Wendy Osloff, called a massive installation by the late David Wojnarowicz, Untitled (Burning Boy Installation) from 1984. Also on display will be works by Carlos Motta and Martin Wong.No matter what art fair it is, we try to create a place that is a little different from the other booths, Ms. Osloff said. Were trying to appeal to curators and really big collectors.The lens of geography is another way to look at the offerings, said Clara M. Kim, a newly appointed curator at Tate Modern in London who organized the Spotlight section.Spotlight, for solo presentations of 20th-century art, has great artists from all over the world, but theres a focus on California art this year, Ms. Kim said. We didnt set out to do it, but there was a happy synergy.Ms. Kim, who is from Los Angeles, said she was pleased to show incredible figures who are lesser known from California, including the painter Joe Goode and the late sculptor and architect David Ireland.For the first time, Frieze New York also includes three Chicago-based galleries, which Ms. Siddall said proved that interesting galleries come from everywhere.John Corbett, co-founder of Chicagos Corbett vs. Dempsey, said: Weve been trying to crack the code of the New York art fair. We havent found the right fit yet, and were excited that this might be it.The gallery is sharing a booth with the Thomas Dane Gallery of London and showing works by various artists under the banner of eccentric figuration.Many of the artist names may be unfamiliar to visitors  including Rebecca Shore and Margot Bergman  and thats the point. Fairs are important for us, even though they are not our preferred mode of exhibiting, Mr. Corbett said. You need them if you are not showing household names.The High Art gallery, based in Paris, is making its debut at Frieze New York in the Frame section, featuring solo exhibitions by galleries that are less than eight years old. The booth will be devoted to the New York artist Valerie Keane.One of High Arts directors, Jason Hwang, described Ms. Keane as a young, emerging talent who makes jagged sculptures in stainless steel, acrylic and rubber that address the body and sexual fetishes.In the last five or six years, this new generation has looked past the post-Internet group and found their own language, Mr. Hwang said. Instead of presenting a conceptual framework, they live the subject  they are the subject.One signature element of Frieze New York over its previous four editions has been its playful artist commission series, known as Frieze Projects. For this year, Alex da Corte has created an enormous balloon that will hover over the fair. Maurizio Cattelan  subject of many major solo museum shows over the years, including one at the Guggenheim  has technically retired from art-making, but he is re-creating a 1994 installation consisting of a live donkey underneath a chandelier.David Horowitz is doing a performance of sorts: He will be acting as a reverse pickpocket. Instead of stealing, he will be dropping small sculptures into peoples pockets, said Cecilia Alemani, who again curated Frieze Projects, as she has for every edition. People will leave with an artwork they didnt even have to pay for. There are 1000 small sculptures in total, mostly pewter, and a handful of golden-colored ones for the extra-lucky visitors.What ties the projects together, Ms. Alemani said, is not a theme but an interactive element. The fair layout can get repetitive, she said. These can provide a surprising encounter."}

{"text": "CHARLESTON, W.Va.  For his first act as the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump strode on stage, extended his arms and conducted the crowd through a chorus of Take Me Home, Country Roads.We need to put our miners back to work! he shouted Thursday to the crowd of more than 12,000 in the sunken, cavernous concrete Civic Center here. Hundreds of miners invited by the campaign to sit behind his podium rose in an extended standing ovation.What followed, in his first campaign event as the last candidate standing in the Republican nomination process, was a Trump rally evolving for the general election, still retaining the energetic, fervent and free-flowing style that endeared him to voters and vaulted him to victory.Gone was lyin Ted, but replaced in equal vitriol with crooked Hillary. Mr. Trump spent extended riffs going after Hillary Clinton, repeatedly referencing her comments about wanting to put the coal industry out of business (her campaign says she misspoke). He called the Clinton Foundation disgusting, referred to the investigation into her emails as secretary of state and Bill Clintons role in creating the North American Free Trade Agreement, and made a thinly veiled joke about Mr. Clintons infidelities.The Clinton administration, of which Hillary was definitely a part, Mr. Trump said, continuing, she was a part of almost everything. Almost, I say, not everything. Almost. Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) May 6, 2016He paused for a beat, as the crowd grew into a mix of laughter and cheers.Terrible, Mr. Trump said, a wry joking tone in his voice. I didnt think the people of West Virginia thought about that. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Terrible, terrible people.Also gone were his complaints about the system being rigged against his candidacy, although for that he gave an honest answer. I used to say its a rigged system, but now I dont say it anymore because I won, he said. I dont care.And gone were the repeated boasts of being self-funding.By the way, for the general election, Im going to help raise money for the party, he said.Notably, he made no reference of the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, who hours before the event said he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump.But over all, the candidate was in good spirits, relishing his victory and buoyed by the feverish crowd, which shrieked its support at every applause break in his speech.Mr. Trump even donned a hard hat after receiving the endorsement of the West Virginia Coal Association, miming using a pick and shovel, before taking it off and risking his carefully crafted hair.You know youre not allowed to hair spray anymore because it affects the ozone, he said.He added, in an allusion perhaps to his campaigns overall slogan: Hair sprays not like it used to be. It used to be real good.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "John Kasichs suspension of his presidential campaign eliminates the last remaining, and most reasonable, Republican opponent to Donald Trump.Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, polled higher than Mr. Trump against Hillary Clinton. That became his sole rationale for remaining in the race as he almost cheerfully racked up primary losses, winning only his home state and fewer total delegates than did Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out in March.In a brief speech on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kasich focused mostly on the people he met on the campaign trail. He said that their stories reminded him that the spirit, the essence of America lies in the hearts and souls of us.He did not mention his opponents or any specifics about his future. As I suspend my campaign today, I have renewed faith, deeper faith, that the Lord will show me the way forward and fulfill the purpose of my life, he said.Mr. Kasich hoped to be an alternative to Mr. Trump in a contested convention in July. With Tuesdays Indiana results having effectively closed off that possibility, is he on Mr. Trumps vice-presidential shortlist? Will he appear alongside Gov. Chris Christie in Mr. Trumps next victory-speech tableau? The Kasich campaign wont say.The Democratic National Committee noted that Mr. Kasichs failed candidacy was further proof of the G.O.P.s irretrievable slide rightward. His positions on abortion rights, same-sex marriage and public-sector unions are very conservative. But his bucking of his own party to expand Medicaid in his state, his support of a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, and his outspoken rejection of Mr. Trumps and Senator Ted Cruzs draconian plans for Muslim immigrants set him apart.Mr. Kasichs belief in the power of government to improve peoples lives, and his use of words like compromise, made him seem a Republican from a different time, which indeed he was, having brokered budget and other deals with the Democrats while in Congress during the 1980s and 90s.Some Republicans say that Mr. Kasichs relatively moderate profile would have been great in the general election, but doomed him among voters who backed Mr. Trump in the primaries. Other Republicans cited his reputation for snappishness while in Congress as a weakness.As candidates more palatable to the Republican leadership than Mr. Trump dropped from the race, few came to Mr. Kasichs side. Mitt Romney, one of the authors of the Never Trump movement, didnt mention Mr. Kasich in his speech denouncing Mr. Trump, and later said hed vote for Mr. Cruz, as did many Never Trumpers.Even John Boehner, the former House speaker from Mr. Kasichs home state, was lukewarm on him. During a forum  at Stanford University last week, in which he called Mr. Cruz Lucifer in the flesh, Mr. Boehner had nicer things to say about his golf partner and texting buddy, Mr. Trump, than about Mr. Kasich, who he said requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends. Some Republicans interpreted those remarks as a clear signal to establishment conservatives to rally around Mr. Trump.Whatever the reasons, in this year of negativity, Mr. Kasichs positive campaign never got off the ground. As he returns to the state that appreciates him, his constructive approach and focus on issues important to peoples lives will be missed."}

The piece begins:There was a moment in Eli Paperboy Reeds gospel quartet class recently, at the end of Blind Willie Johnsons plaintive Let Your Light Shine on Me, when Asher Bethune, a reserved 19-year-old, hit a note so low, so unexpectedly, that the other students jumped and shouted. No one had heard Mr. Bethune sing like that before.Luke Waldron, 17, declared the presence of the supernatural.Hes in this room! he shouted.Mr. Reed, the teacher, beamed and shook his head. Quartet singing will do that to a person, he knew. It had done things to him.In Against Tough Odds, a High School Arts Program Fosters Success Miranda S. Spivack writes about a high school in Maryland that has been a crucible for young artists:DISTRICT HEIGHTS, Md.  Inside a crumbling school building in a neighborhood dotted by pawn shops, fast-food restaurants and strip malls, a security guard is shouting into the girls restroom to make sure there are no problems. Outside, a gaggle of boys is smoking. Trash overflows from a bin just beyond the schools fence.Oblivious to the grim surroundings, young artists are hard at work inside the building, Suitland High School. Those artists are eager participants in a rigorous, four-year academic and arts program that has survived budget cuts, neighborhood violence and a constant shortage of art supplies. Although the program, the Center for Visual and Performing Arts, founded in 1986, has had dwindling enrollment, it has been a crucible for emerging artists, many of them African-Americans, and some now rising to national prominence.Sam Vernon, Suitland class of 05, is represented in three current shows in New York City, including one at the Brooklyn Museum. Eric N. Mack, Suitland 05, is preparing a show that opens in the fall in Paris. The two artists said that the world inside the Annex, as the arts center is known, was where it all began  where they spent up to four hours a day with art teachers, all practicing professionals. Close friends since ninth grade at Suitland, both Ms. Vernon and Mr. Mack went on to Cooper Union and later Yale. Several of this years Suitland graduates are also headed to well-regarded college arts and design programs, many with substantial financial aid. Among them is Malik Mills, 17, who managed to produce finely detailed pen-and-ink drawings even as his family members faced eviction from their home. My photography teacher was the first person to introduce Conceptual art to me, he said.For students intent on a career path in the arts, Suitland is an exemplar program for what we seek to see in schools all over the country, said Jeff Poulin, arts education manager for Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit advocacy group. Yet programs such as Suitlands, he said, are always at risk in public school systems with tight budgets.Students: Read both articles, then tell us: Would the programs described in these pieces interest you?

{"text": "MADRID  Two years ago, a tiny Spanish village gained fame for deciding, finally, to break any possible link to the persecution of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition.It held a referendum in which the villages 56 registered inhabitants agreed to shed its medieval name  Castrillo Matajudos, which roughly translates as Little Hill Fort of Jew Killers. Instead, it is now called Castrillo Mota de Judos, or something like Little Hill Fort of Jews.Since then, however, the village has become a victim of repeated acts of vandalism, mostly anti-Semitic graffiti, that the mayor attributes to unknown far-right extremist groups that, he believes, have no direct connection to his village.The mayor, Lorenzo Rodrguez Prez, filed a police complaint on Tuesday after the latest aggression, in which the villages brand-new road signposts were sprayed over the weekend with anti-Semitic and fascist graffiti, he said.The signposts will need replacing, the mayor said. They had been erected last October, when his village officially completed its name change after the May 2014 referendum.In a handful of recent incidents, he said, extremists painted offensive graffiti onto the facade of the town hall, and damaged public benches and other parts of the village.A name change, sadly, doesnt only bring about positive consequences and the respect it deserves, Mr. Rodrguez Prez said. There are some people who want us to forget the Jews  and certainly not get closer to Israel  but we will not bow to any attempt to create a threatening environment here.As part of the overhaul, the villages authorities have also been promoting its Jewish roots. There is an archaeological project to dig up the remains of a synagogue and other buried evidence of the historic settlement.And in June, Castrillos mayor will lead a delegation of seven officials from the village on a weeklong visit to Israel, during which Castrillo is to be named the twin village of an Israeli community, Kfar Vradim.Since the village announced its name change, the Israeli ambassador to Spain, as well as representatives of the Jewish community in Spain, have visited Castrillo. The rapprochement and official visits have generated some protests by pro-Palestinian activists, the mayor said.We have respected such protests and expect others to respect the choice of people here to change our name, the mayor said. But there is always a portion of people who are too intransigent to understand such basic rights, even in a democratic country like Spain."}
{"text": "What is truth? The idea of what it is and isnt frames The Lyon Who Cried Wolf in several ways. As a result, the viewer is left with more questions than answers. Jamal proclaims, I work damn hard to walk in my truth as an openly gay man. Yet, he enters into a situationship (not an official relationship but maybe more than friends with benefits) with D Major, a man who prefers to keep his sexuality a secret. Considering his characters arc this season, the choice of his new love interest feels like a step backward. Then again, at some point, most people compromise some of their truths in the pursuit of love and companionship. So maybe theres room for both of their truths to coexist?Lucious encourages his sons to be honest in their joint music collaboration, which addresses the tabloid fodder over their family strife. Honest? Thats what you really want? Hakeem says. Unless youre scared, his father replies. Does his willingness to receive that feedback indicate that hes ready to speak more of his truth as well? Well have to wait and see. But speaking of familial ties that bind us, Andre is right when he notes, Time and again we are confronted with the truth of what a mess we all are, and time and again we choose one another. Think that sounds silly? We all have a family member who we continue love, even if they are a hot mess.There are few places where the Lyon family dysfunction comes to a boiling point more than at Leviticus. The club serves as a de facto business venue for the label as well as an extended living room for family meetings. Since the shows beginning it has remained a space where deals have been brokered and broken, beefs squashed and started, truths revealed and hidden.On a particular night its Luciouss turn to make a confession. Or not. As Cookie wrangles him, Hakeem and Jamal for a rehearsal, Andre walks in and introduces a special guest  Leah Walker. Lucious has done many things but surely he wouldnt lie about his mother being dead, right? Well, he didnt. At least not in his eyes. My mother died the day that they locked her up, he later tells Cookie. Leahs re-emergence prompts Lucious to emotionally revisit some lighter moments, like their shared love of music. He keeps her at a firm distance, though, instructing his housekeeper to monitor her every move. Leah may be a guest in his home but shes not a welcome one.Interestingly enough, there are no childhood flashbacks in this episode. However, moments like when Leah forces Lucious to eat cake, (while wielding a knife a tad too close to him) serve as reminders to those darker times. Lucious may have left Dwight, his former self, behind but Leah still retains a certain hold over him. No name change, amount of fame or hush money can undo that. Thirsty Rawlings might be right: The truth is not more important than what you can persuade people to believe.Some questions about Lucious and Leahs relationship I was fine until you were born. Im sorry I was too weak to kill you when I had the chance.  LeahWelp. Its safe to say that Lucious wont be buying Leah a necklace from Tiffanys for Mothers Day this year. She initially seems to want to reconnect but later becomes hostile toward him. Why does she really want to be in Luciouss home? Given his strong feelings about the danger she poses, why did he agree to let her stay? Side note: Who let her in the kitchen to bake all of those cakes? And why did his staff take orders from her? I needed her to stay dead. None of yall understand how dangerous she really is.  LuciousBeing in jail, facing the serious prospect of losing his company, Cookie being released from prison  nothing has terrified Lucious like the sight of his mother, back after more than 20 years. In a rare moment on the show, he appears truly terrified. Its less about her physical proximity than it is about her ability to remind Lucious of the emotional scars of his childhood and the possibility she could inflict new ones. Lucious has cried wolf in his own ways a number of times. Will anyone believe that Leah is as dangerous as he says she is? Or does she know of other skeletons in his closet?"}
{"text": "Tensions between Iran and the United States, never far from the surface, showed signs of worsening on Wednesday, with the Iranians threatening to block a vital Persian Gulf access route and protesting what they called the American meddling approach and tone.The Iranian messages, conveyed in statements by a commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and by the Foreign Ministry, came a few days after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, expressed exasperation with the United States, questioning the longstanding deployment of the Navys Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf.It is Americans who should explain why they have come here from the other side of the world and stage war games, the ayatollah said in remarks widely reported in Irans state news media.Together, the messages appeared to reflect a steady buildup of anti-American sentiment in Iran recently despite the nuclear agreement that took effect in January, which, on paper at least, eased the countrys economic isolation. American and Iranian diplomats had hoped the agreement would help lead to a new period of dtente in the estranged relations between their countries.But the Iranians have not yet benefited economically and have accused the United States of obstructing their ability to do business and attract investments, in part because of other American financial restrictions unaffected by the nuclear agreement.Iran is not experiencing the benefits it envisioned after sanctions relief, said Alireza Nader, an Iran expert at the Washington offices of the RAND Corporation, a research group. The increasingly angry tone from Iranian leaders, he said, can be partly traced to Iran signaling its displeasure about that problem.The Iranians have also taken note of efforts by some lawmakers in Washington who opposed the nuclear agreement and who have warned against a resumption of commercial dealings with Iran.On Monday, for example, three members of Congress sent a letter to Boeings chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, urging him in the strongest possible terms not to execute any sales to Iran, which the company is considering after meeting with Iranian aviation officials last month. Boeing has not commented on the letter but has acknowledged opening discussions with Iran.The Iranians have also been seething over an April 20 Supreme Court ruling that permitted the use of nearly $2 billion in seized Iranian assets to compensate American victims of overseas attacks that United States officials have attributed to Iran despite its denials. Iran remains on the State Departments list of state sponsors of terrorism, another sore point with the Iranians.Last week, Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, known for his good relations with Secretary of State John Kerry and for advocating improved relations with the United States, wrote to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, calling the ruling a crime and an example of American arrogance.The warning from the Revolutionary Guards about blocking American access to the Persian Gulf waterway known as the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping route, appeared to be partly a response to a congressional resolution introduced April 28 by Representative J. Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia.The resolution condemned what it called Irans illegal detention of American sailors patrolling near Iran in January and said Iran had undermined stability in the Arabian Gulf.The use of the term Arabian Gulf has long irritated Iran, which bans publications that do not use Persian Gulf to describe the body of water.On Wednesday, Irans Fars News Agency, which has links to the Revolutionary Guards, said Lt. Cmdr. Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami had issued a warning to the United States to avoid escalation.Iran will decisively confront any menacing passage through the Strait of Hormuz, Fars quoted him as saying. We warn the Americans not to repeat their past mistakes, and they should learn from historical realities.In what appeared to be a coordinated message, the Foreign Ministry delivered a note of protest on Wednesday to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents American interests. The official Tasnim News Agency said the note, referring to Mr. Forbess resolution, slammed Washingtons meddling in the security affairs of the Persian Gulf and strongly objected to the use of a fake name for the body of water in a resolution proposed by a U.S. congressman last week.Political analysts in the United States noted that the Strait of Hormuz has long been a potential flash point for American-Iranian animosity, but questioned whether Iran would risk a military confrontation by closing it or denying American access.Eugene Gholz, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas and a former Pentagon adviser, played down Irans umbrage at the use of the term Arabian Gulf.Nobody is seriously going to contemplate fighting a war over that, he said. But he added that he did not rule out further escalation, saying, People who are looking for an excuse to fight will find something."}

Trump now that he has become the Republican Partys presumptive nominee.Yes, Im a Republican, hes a Republican, Mr. Adelson said in a brief interview. Hes our nominee. Whoever the nominee would turn out to be, any one of the 17  he was one of the 17. He won fair and square.Mr. Adelson made the comments while at a gala dinner in Manhattan for the World Values Network, a Jewish organization.Mr. Trump went after Mr. Adelson on Twitter in October, writing that the donor wanted to make Senator Marco Rubio of Florida his perfect little puppet. But Mr. Trump also courted him; the two men met in December. Mr. Adelson later said that they discussed Israel and that he found Mr. Trump very charming.Mr. Adelson ultimately stayed neutral through the last few months of nominating contests.Mr. Adelson said on Thursday that he had spoken to Mr. Trump recently, but did not elaborate about the timing or nature of their communication. He told another journalist that he thinks that Mr. Trump will be good for Israel.Mr. Adelsons voice of support was particularly notable given that the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group he has funded heavily, suggested after Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee that it is focusing mostly on preserving Republican gains in the House and the Senate.Also on Thursday, Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, whose family helped finance a super PAC devoted solely to stopping Mr. Trump, will endorse the Republican Partys standard-bearer at an Omaha rally on Friday, an aide confirmed.Taylor Gage, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Ricketts would appear and give remarks at the event with Mr. Trump.The governor has said for months that he would support the Republican nominee, Mr. Gage said.Members of the Ricketts family donated millions of dollars to the Our Principles PAC and seeded its earliest efforts at denying Mr. Trump the nomination. The PAC is still active, but it spent lightly in the Indiana primary, which Mr. Trump won soundly on Tuesday night.Mr. Trump also won support from a former rival and  the former Texas governor, Rick Perry, who told CNN on Thursday that he would try to help Mr. Trump and was open to being his vice-presidential nominee.Mr. Perry had carved out early territory in the presidential race last summer by describing Mr. Trump as a cancer on conservatism. But Mr. Trump essentially rolled over him, claiming him as an early victim of his own candidacy.Mr. Perry told CNN he would do everything he could to help Mr. Trump.Those endorsements came on the same day that the House speaker, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, said he was not prepared to support the nominee yet. Mary Matalin, a former adviser to Dick Cheney, told Bloomberg Politics that she had switched her registration to Libertarian."}
{"text": "In the American cinephile circles of the 1960s, each new film from the French director Jean-Luc Godard was an event. Vital film critics like Manny Farber, Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael and public intellectuals like Susan Sontag weighed in, creating a near-constant colloquy on how this director was reinventing cinema. The buzz and argument were equally fevered in Paris, Mr. Godards home at the time.But Anna Karina, the Danish-born model turned actress who during this period was Mr. Godards muse, leading lady and wife  one of the screens great beauties and an enduring symbol of the French New Wave  doesnt recollect the hype or intellectual foment. Reminiscing about working with Mr. Godard, she largely remembers freedom and fun.We did not see ourselves as remaking cinema at the time, at least not in my view, Ms. Karina, now 75, said, speaking in English by phone from Los Angeles. Myself and the other actors were not part of the industry; we werent inside the star system. We were running around, shooting in the streets, hiding behind trees to do our makeup. It was a very simple way of working.Ms. Karina, who lives in France, is making a rare visit to the United States, where, in Los Angeles and New York, she is presenting several Godard films at various theaters. On Friday, she will appear at Film Forum in Manhattan for a newly restored version of Mr. Godards wry, eccentric quasi-caper Band of Outsiders (1964).She met Mr. Godard when she was still in her teens. He was preparing his debut feature, Breathless, and wanted to cast her in a bit role; she balked at its nudity requirement. They began a romance, acted opposite each other in an Eric Rohmer short and married in 1961.When he was a critic in the 1950s, Mr. Godard wrote, The cinema does not query the beauty of a woman, it only doubts her heart, records her perfidy and sees only her movements.Ms. Karina, 10 years younger than Mr. Godard, cheerfully allowed that their relationship had more than a touch of Pygmalion to it, and she spoke admiringly of him as a teacher, recalling his erudition with some awe. Their films together can be read as a multivolume work about their relationship.In Le Petit Soldat, their first film together (although its release was held up for several years by French censors), she was the young revolutionary as object of desire. In A Woman Is a Woman (1961) she was a stripper flirting with domesticity. In Vivre Sa Vie, Ms. Karina played a desultory beauty who drifts into streetwalking on the way to cinematic sainthood.Band of Outsiders saw her as nave, coquettish but clever, with a streak of mischief. In Alphaville, she was a robotic woman of the bleak future, introduced to love via poetry by the tough guy Eddie Constantine. For their final collaborations, Mr. Godard made his soon-to-be-ex-wife a femme fatale. (They divorced in 1965.) In Pierrot Le Fou, she seduces and double-crosses Jean-Paul Belmondo, and in Made in U.S.A. she gender-reverses the trench-coated noir antihero, leaving a trail of corpses.We appreciated that what we were doing was different through the way Jean-Luc directed us, physically, she said on the phone. In older Hollywood movies, a character will make an entrance, close a door, light a cigarette, sit down, have a drink. In Jean-Lucs movies, you were doing everything at once, and sometimes you wouldnt shut the door all the way. Sometimes your cigarette wouldnt light on first try. You were always moving through the scene in an active way that was more like being than acting.While Mr. Godard never worked from a standard script, Ms. Karina insisted that the actors were not improvising. He would come in with prepared texts for us, which we rehearsed, and were required to say as he presented to us.She added: The only thing I can recall being allowed to improvise was the little singsong I dont know what to do chant in Pierrot Le Fou. Which I came up with because I literally did not know what to do!The Godard-Karina relationship was famously tumultuous. She told a dizzying story of the pairs embarking on an impromptu road trip to the South of France: Maybe I didnt understand Jean-Luc exactly. There I was thinking wed have a nice holiday in the South of France; about 200 kilometers in, I look at him and say, Youre not happy. And he says, Im not unhappy, Im just a little disappointed, I canceled a meeting with Truffaut in Paris. So he turns back. And after 100 kilometers, he looks at me and says Youre not happy, and he turns around again. And so it goes.Ms. Karina said the turmoil did not bleed into their working relationship until very late. But when she recalled Mr. Godards presenting her with a difficult monologue on the set of Made in U.S.A. and insisting on shooting it right away, her incredulity and indignation made it sound as if she was upset about something that had happened just yesterday. He was making a fool of me, and he did it on purpose, she bristled.After parting ways with Mr. Godard, she seemed to take roles that flirted with international stardom, working with eminent directors like George Cukor and Tony Richardson. Of the 1969 adaptation of Vladimir Nabokovs Laughter in the Dark, she said, It was a mistake for Tony Richardson to change the setting from prewar Germany to contemporary London with all the miniskirts and the bling-bling.She is currently working on a memoir about her early years and putting together a stage musical for which she has written songs.Ms. Karina seems to regard her work with Mr. Godard with pride and affection. Its very touching, wherever I go, to see very young people come to the films, whether in Japan or South Korea or the United States or France, she said. The films feel like they are not old, or old fashioned; they still feel fresh and touch people. Its a fantastic gift he gave to me."}

{"text": "Q. Can you recommend a better image viewer than the one that comes with Windows 10? The old Windows Photo Viewer was fine  maybe it is possible to get that back?A. The Photos app for Windows 10 automatically sorts your pictures into albums and comes with image-editing tools to improve and enhance your shots, but if you prefer the older Windows Photo Viewer program, you may be able to revive it. If you upgraded your computer from the Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 operating system, Windows Photo Viewer may still be lurking out of sight on the computer after being benched by the Photos app.One way to check if you still have Windows Photo Viewer is to right-click on a photo file, select the Open With command from the contextual menu and see if Windows Photo Viewer is in the list of programs to use instead of the default app. If it is, you can use it to open the file at this point, or go to the System area in Windows 10 Settings app and select Windows Photo Viewer in the Default Apps area.If you installed a fresh version of Windows 10 on the computer instead  and did not upgrade from an older version of Windows  getting Windows Photo Viewer is possible, but harder to do. Several Windows-oriented sites (including TenForums.com) have posted instructions for restoring Windows Photo Viewer to prominence, but you do need to fiddle with the Windows Registry to do it. Back up your system and proceed at your own risk.Should you decide to move on without Windows Photo Viewer, Microsofts Windows app store has several image-editing programs, including Fhotoroom and Adobe Photoshop Express, which are free with some in-app purchases for additional features. If you prefer a more nimble photo-viewer program, (typically used to open and browse images in a wide variety of file formats), well-reviewed apps include XnView, Imagine Picture Viewer, IrfanView and FastStone Image Viewer."}
{"text": "HONG KONG  On Java Road in Hong Kong, a new pair of brown leather Gucci loafers, lovingly wrapped in cellophane, hangs from a storefront  the deal of a lifetime at less than $3.Just not this lifetime.The shoes are paper replicas, meant to be burned as offerings to relatives who have died  a modern twist on an old Chinese custom. At specialty shops across this city, the bereaved can choose from an impressive array of goods to send to their departed loved ones, including Italian sports cars, smartphones, six-packs of beer, cigarettes, dress shirts and sport jackets.One store, next to Hong Kongs Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, even sells paper replicas of McDonalds value meals, complete with fries, soda and a package of something called Chicken MuNeggtc.But the Gucci handbags and shoes that grandmother may have cooed over when she was among the living now appear to be out of her ethereal reach. A shopkeeper quickly snatched the loafers away from one inquiring customer, explaining that they were no longer for sale.It seems Guccis zeal to protect its brand extends into the hereafter.Last week, its parent company, Paris-based Kering, sent a letter to six local stores that sell the paper offerings, telling them to stop selling replicas of Gucci products because they were using its famous trademark that graces shoes, wallets, hats, jewelry and womens purses.What we are trying to do is let them know that Gucci is a trademark and we are trying to protect it, Charlotte Judet, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Kering, said by telephone. We fully respect the funeral context.Elaborate paper offerings for the dead are for sale the world over, available for purchase by the living across Asia, from Cambodia to mainland China. In China, the bereaved, with a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a smartphone, can buy replicas of everything from bonsai plants to flat-screen televisions for home delivery.As incomes have soared and consumerism has taken hold across the continent, the cardboard replicas, once limited to fake currency, have become increasingly elaborate. One shop offers a paper wall-unit air conditioner, presumably for relatives who may be in the lower reaches of the hereafter.The practice has even migrated across the ocean. In 2011 in New York, one Chinatown shopkeeper was arrested for selling cardboard replicas of designer handbags and loafers, and charged with copyright infringement.But Gucci chose to make a stand in Hong Kong, not in Beijing, New York or Bangkok. The forces at play essentially define Hong Kongs place in the world. Here is a city that combines a no-holds-barred consumer culture, a strong bond to Chinas old traditions, and a robust legal system, inherited from the British, that respects and enforces intellectual property rights. Hong Kong is, at its essence, a fusion of Eastern culture, global capitalism and Western law.People in Hong Kong are law-abiding, Alice Lee, an associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong who focuses on intellectual property, said in a telephone interview. We have had the benefit of British rule for such a long time.But Ms. Lee said Gucci would have a difficult time proving that makers of paper offerings infringed on its trademark. To successfully sue for trademark infringement, she said, a company has to demonstrate that people confuse the cardboard replicas with real Gucci products, which is highly unlikely.Her colleague Haochen Sun, a professor who studies trademark protection of luxury brands, said Gucci might have a case under Hong Kong law if it argued that the paper offerings, sold in shops only blocks from the companys own retail outlets, blurred the distinctiveness of Guccis brand or caused it harm.The subtleties of trademark law have yet to trickle down to the street level.Instead of laughter, Guccis letter, which threatened no legal action and asked for no compensation, prompted compliance from some of the shops that sell the paper offerings. Along Java Road, Gucci-branded offerings for the dead disappeared from the shelves, as shopkeepers feared that their tiny businesses could collapse if subjected to a lawsuit.Sitting on a stool in the back of one shop, past the incense and ersatz packs of cigarettes from brands like Danhill, Lucky Strlke, Marlbero and Sailem, one proprietor, who asked to be identified by only her last name, Chan, said she and others had little choice because their businesses were so small.For Gucci, it was an easy win, even though its letter did draw some ridicule in the local press.The symbolism of a global, multibillion-dollar luxury company warning perhaps some of the poorest retailers in the city over items that could not ever be taken for the real thing just seems a little bullying, Jing Zhang, fashion editor for The South China Morning Post, wrote Tuesday.Ms. Lee, the law professor, had a different interpretation. Purpose served, she said. They want to show the world that they are taking their intellectual property rights seriously.The shopkeepers lament what they see as the absurdity of it all. Their target market  the dead  does not appear to intersect with the well-heeled, or aspiring-to-be wealthy, living and breathing Gucci customers who frequent the outlets shops in Hong Kong, one of the companys top markets.Our customers are totally different, said one shopkeeper outside Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, who gave only his surname, Lan. They burn these things to send to the spirits.Neither Ms. Chan nor Mr. Lan had received a letter from Gucci. Ms. Chan read about it in a local newspaper and quickly moved to exorcise her store of any paper replicas of Gucci projects.Actually, the word Gucci rarely appears in the world of paper offerings. In almost all instances, the enterprising manufacturers  from somewhere in mainland China  alter the spelling. Those Gucci loafers at the shop next door were labeled Guuci. Mr. Lan, who as of Monday had not heard of the warning letter, had one paper Gueei purse on offer.Ms. Chan said the whole idea of Gucci threatening such action was odd. It has nothing to do with us, she said."}
{"text": "The wearable fitness device maker Fitbit on Wednesday forecast profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analysts estimates, overshadowing a strong first-quarter report and sending the companys shares down 13 percent in after-hours trading.Fitbit has been spending heavily to diversify its portfolio of colorful wristbands and clippable devices that track calories, sleeping patterns and heart rates, to better compete against rising rivals from Apple and Garmin, as well as to tap into new markets.The time to invest is now, said the companys chief financial officer, Bill Zerella. He added that Fitbit would need to increase spending in China and India as it builds a global brand.Fitbits operating costs nearly tripled to $215 million in the first quarter, which ended April 2, largely because of marketing for the $200 Blaze smartwatch and the Alta wristband, the companys first global releases.Fitbit forecast an adjusted profit of 8 to 11 cents a share for the second quarter, widely missing analysts average estimate of 26 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But it slightly raised its forecast for full-year revenue and profit.Net income attributable to common stockholders fell to $11 million, or 5 cents a share in the first quarter, from $15.6 million, or 22 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, Fitbit earned 10 cents a share, breezing past analysts average expectation of 3 cents.Revenue jumped 50 percent to $505.4 million, beating the average estimate of $443.1 million.The company said it sold 4.8 million connected health and fitness devices in the quarter. Worldwide sales of wearable devices are expected to grow 18.4 percent in 2016, to 274.6 million, according to research firm Gartner.Shares of Fitbit are down 42 percent this year through Wednesdays close of $17.10."}
{"text": "ISTANBUL  The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will soon leave office, a government official said. His departure is occurring amid a disagreement between the two men over Mr. Erdogans drive for more power.The two leaders met on Wednesday night, according to the Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been announced publicly. Its unlikely that Davutoglu will run for leadership again, he said.The prime minister is expected to hold a news conference on Thursday after a meeting with officials of the governing Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., according to Turkish news reports, which also said that Mr. Davutoglu was likely to step aside after a coming special party congress.The leadership change atop the Islamist party comes as the country is facing multiple challenges, including a war with Kurdish militants, terrorist attacks by Islamic State fighters, and the arrival of millions of Syrian refugees. The shuffle clears the way for Mr. Erdogan, who critics say has become increasingly authoritarian, to consolidate even more authority.Under Turkeys Constitution, the prime minister is the most powerful official, and the president, although he has some genuine powers, is a largely ceremonial figure. But Mr. Erdogan has not been like previous Turkish presidents, and there has been little doubt that he is the countrys pre-eminent political figure.Mr. Davutoglu, who became prime minister in 2014, after Mr. Erdogan was elected president, had long been seen as subservient to Mr. Erdogan.But simmering tensions between them boiled over this week, leading to speculation in the Turkish news media about a rift. The tensions apparently reached a breaking point last week, after party officials stripped Mr. Davutoglu of his power to choose provincial party leaders.Even with a person as compliant as Davutoglu, the relationship didnt work, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and the chairman of the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies, a research organization here.In public, Mr. Davutoglu has sought mostly to play the role of party loyalist and devotee to Mr. Erdogan, but analysts say the two men have privately differed on several issues.Mr. Davutoglu was said to be resistant to Mr. Erdogans long-held ambition to rewrite Turkeys Constitution and establish an executive presidency.Recently, Mr. Davutoglu had suggested he was willing to return to peace negotiations to end a long war  which resumed in earnest last year  with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., while Mr. Erdogan has appeared more hawkish.The two leaders also seemed to differ on monetary policy, with Mr. Davutoglu supporting the independence of the central bank, and Mr. Erdogan seeking to intervene for lower interest rates.In choosing to step down as the leader of the A.K.P., Mr. Davutoglu will clear the way for Mr. Erdogan to pick a new party boss who will then become prime minister.The new elected prime ministers main mission will be to drive forward the presidential agenda, Mr. Ulgen said.But even with a new prime minister, it will not be so easy for Mr. Erdogan to alter the Constitution as he wants. The A.K.P., which has been in power for more than a decade, with Mr. Erdogan the prime minister for much of that time, does not have enough seats in Parliament to approve the changes on its own or call a national referendum on a new constitution. Most opinion polls show the Turkish public opposes Mr. Erdogans proposed presidential system.Mr. Erdogan rose to power in 2003, and the A.K.P. won several national elections. But last June, the party lost its parliamentary majority and the Kurdish political party won seats in Parliament for the first time.That is when war resumed between the Turkish state and the Kurdish P.K.K., which seemed eager to return to arms. Critics of Mr. Erdogan said he sought to use the conflict as a political strategy to regain nationalist votes.Indeed, after failed coalition talks with opposition parties last summer, Mr. Erdogan called for new elections, and the party regained its majority in November.With Mr. Erdogans not having enough support to amend the Constitution, analysts have predicted that with a new prime minister, he could move to hold early elections in a bid to amass more seats in Parliament."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM  The 50 paintings in Twilight Over Berlin: Masterworks from the Nationalgalerie, 1905-45, many of them labeled degenerate by the Nazis, have become a cause clbre since the show opened at the Israel Museum here in October.Extended through June 7  because of high demand, Twilight Over Berlin carries with it a sense of homecoming, even though most of the paintings had until now never left Germany.The exhibition is a meandering and harrowing collection of several styles of art that flourished in Germany in the decades before the war: German Expressionism, New Objectivity, Dadaism and Bauhaus, most prominently.Taking up several rooms of this sprawling hilltop museum, Twilight Over Berlin chronicles how Nazism chipped away at the creativity and reputation of dozens of artists who hit career highs in the waning years of the Weimar Republic.These works, which had never left the Berlin museum  many of which were painted by Jewish artists and others who came to Germany and fled to other countries during and after the Nazi era  have become a revelation for both the throngs of viewers and for those who mounted the exhibition.Israelis are very thirsty for the expression of a time that is so critical to our history, said Adina Kamien-Kazhdan, the exhibitions curator. They know what happened to our people, they know the history, and now theyre able to see how these avant-garde artists commented on those living through that era.What that means for viewers  and for Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan and her colleagues  is a visual and emotional journey to an era long depicted in movies, archival footage and history books, but rarely through such a collection of works that represent so many artistic styles.The 50 pieces were available as the Nationalgalerie undergoes an extensive renovation, and Twilight Over Berlin evolved as a collaborative effort to mark the 50th anniversary of the Israel Museum and of diplomatic relations between Israel and Germany.There have been a lot of requests to the Nationalgalerie over the years to consider allowing these iconic works to leave, but we felt it was ideally timed for these two important anniversaries, said Udo Kittelmann, director of the Nationalgalerie. Its the very first time that such a collection of important German art has gone to Israel. It was also important to allow them to stay in Israel for quite a long time, as this exhibition is doing.The legacy of such a popular show, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said, is that it includes artists unknown to many viewers, which humanizes the experience since its not just about celebrity artists. Whereas there are many recognizable names  such as Max Beckmann, George Grosz and Emile Nolde  there are lesser-known but equally important names who challenged the artistic status quo in 1930s Germany: Curt Querner, Paula Modersohn-Becker, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. They provide a fresh interpretation of a well-documented piece of history.You see the trauma of World War I and World War II and the connection between them, but its more palatable than just seeing photographs. Its something you can deal with more emotionally, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said. We distance ourselves from those difficult images weve seen dozens of times and become immune to it. But this is about resensitizing us.Twilight Over Berlin mostly displays art from the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in 1937, which attracted three million visitors. The artworks were maligned for not depicting the Aryan values and artistic realism that the Nazis coveted. Many of the artists ultimately fled the country for America, Israel and other countries. The artwork was shown in a demonizing way. Intellectual, Socialist, Bolshevik, Jewish  it was all lumped into the same category, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said. At the same time, the Nazis staged the Great German Art Exhibition, which showed muscular men emphasizing military power as opposed to the fallen soldier.This mixture of styles was evident on a recent tour of the exhibition on a rare snowy day in Jerusalem. Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan highlighted a few paintings, focusing on the raw beauty of many works that offer a dark perspective on a country in turmoil between two wars.The opening painting in the exhibition is Christian Schads Sonja from 1928, a staid portrait of a woman in a cafe. Beneath its placid surface lies the beginning of what would become degenerate art in the eyes of the Nazis.Schad shows the new woman of the roaring 20s in a cafe in Berlin smoking Camel cigarettes with her androgynous haircut, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said. The men are cut out, probably emphasizing the changing role of women who were part of the workforce because of World War I.Something as simple as this was labeled as degenerate almost as much for what it doesnt show as for what it does. And many of the artists were not rebellious against the rise of Nazism or politically motivated in their art.Only six out of 112 out of artists in the Degenerate Art Show in 1937 were Jewish. Its not even being a Jew that is the issue. Degenerate artists lost their jobs in the academies and couldnt teach. They were persecuted people, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said. For example, Emil Nolde was a member of the Nazi party, but that didnt even exonerate him. It didnt help to even engage in the ideology if you were engaging in this kind of avant-garde art.But beyond the shifting depiction of women that the Nazis found so offensive, many of the prewar artists were merely depicting the brutal aftermath of World War I. This show portrays some of the most powerful anti-military works of the 20th century, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said.One of the best examples of that is Otto Dixs The Skat Players from 1920  similar in theme to War Cripples, a work by Dix that was in the 1937 Munich exhibition  which offers a disturbing peek into a simple card game between three hideously disfigured World War I veterans. Their bodies are so destroyed that Dix said their three bodies dont add up to one whole human, she said, pointing out their various injuries and deformities.The exhibitions final chapter features the Bauhaus artists who fused industrial design with art. More than 20 of them fled to the British Mandate of Palestine during the war, and other names from the Bauhaus movement shaped the modern world, Klee and Kandinsky among them, as well as lesser-known names.The majority of these artists are well known, but many arent, Ms. Kamien-Kazhdan said. Visitors to the exhibition seem to share that sentiment.Ive lived in Israel for 46 years and have never seen anything this comprehensive about such a rich and difficult piece of history, said Diane Spitz, a resident of Jerusalem. It makes dramatically clear that insane politics can influence art and gives us an understanding as to how this led to such a great tragedy."}
{"text": "Last November, Meg Muoz went to Los Angeles to speak at the annual West Coast conference of Amnesty International. She was nervous. Three months earlier, at a meeting attended by about 500 delegates from 80 countries, Amnesty voted to adopt a proposal in favor of the full decriminalization of consensual sex work, sparking a storm of controversy. Members of the human rights group in Norway and Sweden resigned en masse, saying the organizations goal should be to end demand for prostitution, not condone it. Around the world, on social media and in the press, opponents blasted Amnesty. In Los Angeles, protesters ringed the lobby of the Sheraton where the conference was being held, and as Muoz tried to enter, a woman confronted her and became upset as Muoz explained that, as a former sex worker, she supported Amnestys position. She agreed to respect my time at the microphone, Muoz told me. That didnt exactly happen  the woman and other critics yelled out during her panel  but I understand why it was so hard for her.Muoz was in the middle of a pitched battle over the terms, and even the meaning, of sex work. In the United States and around the globe, many sex workers (the term activists prefer to prostitute) are trying to change how they are perceived and policed. They are fighting the legal status quo, social mores and also mainstream feminism, which has typically focused on saving women from the sex trade rather than supporting sex workers who demand greater rights. But in the last decade, sex-worker activists have gained new allies. If Amnestys international board approves a final policy in favor of decriminalization in the next month, it will join forces with public-health organizations that have successfully worked for years with groups of sex workers to halt the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS, especially in developing countries. The urgency of the H.I.V. epidemic really exploded a lot of taboos, says Catherine Murphy, an Amnesty policy adviser.Onstage, wearing a white blouse with lace, her face framed by glasses and straight brown hair, Muoz, who is 43, looked calm and determined as she leaned into the microphone to tell her story. She started escorting at 18, after she graduated from high school in Los Angeles County, picking up men at a dance club a couple of times a week and striking deals to have sex for $100 or so, at a hotel or their apartments. She had a part-time job as a restaurant hostess, but she liked feeling desired and making money on the side to spend on clothes and entertainment. I really, really did love the work, she told her Amnesty audience of more than 100. I was a little reckless. The same recklessness led her to methamphetamine. When her parents found out she was using, they sent her to rehab. She stopped escorting and using drugs and found a serious boyfriend. When she was 24, the relationship ended, and around that time her parents sold their house. Muoz started living on her own for the first time. With rent and car insurance to pay, and a plan to save for college, escorting became her livelihood. I was moving toward a goal, and sex work helped me do that, Muoz told the crowd.A few years later, however, another ex-boyfriend, with whom she was still close, started to take advantage of the underground nature of Muozs work. At first, she told me, he asked her to pay to get his car back after it was towed. Then he started demanding more money and dictating when she worked and which clients she saw. Muoz didnt exactly seem like a trafficking victim; she was driving her own car, going to school and paying her expenses. But looking back, she says thats the way she sees herself. Because the work I was doing was illegal, he started to hold it over my head. He blackmailed me by threatening to tell everyone, including my family.The man was violent, and Muoz extricated herself with the help of a friend, whom she later married. Haunted by the control her ex-boyfriend had exerted over her, she founded in 2009 a small faith-based group called Abeni near her home in Orange County, to help other women escape from prostitution, as she had. A couple of years later, Muoz, who now has four children, started letting herself remember the period earlier in her life when escorting served her well, as a source of income and even stability. Struggling internally, she had a crisis of conscience, she says, and came to regret her assumptions about what was necessarily best for Abenis clients. She stopped taking on new ones, and then turned Abeni into one of the few groups in the country that helps people either leave sex work or continue doing it safely.At the Amnesty conference, Muoz told the crowd that she thinks decriminalization would have benefits for many people by bringing the sex trade out from underground. I believe in the empowered sex worker, she said. I was one. But the empowered sex worker isnt representative of the majority of sex workers. Its O.K. for us to be honest about this. She was referring to the social and economic divide in the profession. Activists in the sex-workers movement tend to be educated and make hundreds of dollars an hour. The words they often use to describe themselves  dominatrix, fetishist, sensual masseuse, courtesan, sugar baby, whore, witch, pervert  can be self-consciously half-wicked.Some of their concerns can seem far removed from those of women who feel they must sell sex to survive  a mother trying to scrape together the rent, say, or a runaway teenager. People in those situations generally dont call themselves sex workers or see themselves as part of a movement. Its not something people we work with would ever talk about, says Deon Haywood, the director of Women With a Vision in New Orleans, an African-American health collective that works with low-income women and trans clients. Some of them sell sex, Haywood says, because its more flexible and pays better than low-wage work at businesses like McDonalds.Human rights advocates tend to focus on people in grim circumstances. Like many feminists, Im conflicted about sex work, says Liesl Gerntholtz, executive director of the womens rights division at Human Rights Watch, which took a stand in favor of decriminalization four years ago. Youre often talking about women who have extremely limited choices. Would I like to live in a world where no one has to do sex work? Absolutely. But thats not the case. So I want to live in a world where women do it largely voluntarily, in a way that is safe. If theyre raped by a police officer or a client, they can lay a charge and know it will be investigated. Their kid wont be expelled from school, and their landlord wont kick them out.Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, along with other groups that support decriminalization  U.N.AIDS, the World Health Organization, the Global Commission on H.I.V. and the Law and the Open Society Foundations  acknowledge that there can be grave harms associated with the sex industry, but say that they see changes in the law as a precondition to reducing them. Last year, an analysis in The Lancet predicted that decriminalization of sex work could have the largest effect on the course of the H.I.V. epidemic, by increasing access to condoms and medical treatment. Governments can free themselves to crack down on trafficking and under-age prostitution, human rights advocates argue, if they stop arresting consenting adults.Its a pragmatic argument. But the sex-workers movement also hinges on an ideological conviction  the belief that the criminal law should not be used here as an instrument of punishment or shame, because sex work isnt inherently immoral or demeaning. It can even be authentically feminist. Once youve done it, you always know: When it comes down to it, I have everything I need to survive, says Anna Saini, a former sex worker who is now a sex-worker activist and law student living in Brooklyn. Thats powerful. This view poses a deep challenge to traditional Western feminism, which treats the commercial sex industry as an ugly source of sexual inequality.The activists themselves are a fractious bunch. They belong to a variety of small and sometimes competing groups and question one anothers bona fides on social media and a blog called Tits and Sass. Women who publicly argue the case for decriminalization tend to be white. Women of color say that its harder for them to get an audience; they also dont want white women to speak for them. Trans women raise similar objections. Dont tell my story in support of a cis womans story, Monica Jones, who is black and transgender, cautioned me. She did sex work without qualms to help pay the tuition for her social-work degree at Arizona State University. If you want to be with me, youre going to pay me or buy me a ring, she says frankly of her partners. Two years ago, she accepted a ride to a bar with a man and was found guilty of prostitution; her case became a cause clbre when she challenged her conviction, saying she was just going out for a beer that night, and won her appeal.Some opponents of decriminalization call themselves abolitionists, consciously invoking the battle to end slavery as well as the one for equality. If prostitution is legal, and men can buy womens bodies with impunity, its the extreme sexualization of women, says Yasmeen Hassan, the global executive director of Equality Now, a womens rights group that campaigns against trafficking. Theyre sexual objects. What does that mean for how professional women are seen? And if women are sex toys you can buy, think about the impact on relationships between men and women, in marriage or otherwise.The United States has some of the worlds most sweeping laws against prostitution, with more than 55,000 arrests annually, more than two-thirds of which involve women. Women of color are at higher risk of arrest. (In New York City, they make up 85 percent of people who are arrested.) So are trans women, who are more likely to do sex work because of employment discrimination. The mark left by a criminal record can make it even harder to find other employment. In Louisiana five years ago, 700 people, many of them women of color and trans women, were listed on the sex-offender registry for the equivalent of a prostitution misdemeanor. Women With a Vision, Deon Haywoods group, won a lawsuit to remove them in 2013.Because abolitionists see these women as victims, they generally oppose arresting them. But they want to continue using the criminal law as a weapon of moral disapproval by prosecuting male customers, alongside pimps and traffickers  though this approach still tends to entangle sex workers in a legal net.Last July, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, an abolitionist group, accused Amnesty of supporting a system of gender apartheid, in which some women are set apart for consumption by men, in a letter with 400 signatories, including Gloria Steinem, Lena Dunham, Kate Winslet and Meryl Streep. Anna Saini, the Brooklyn sex-worker activist, went from feeling betrayed by the celebrities to feeling victorious. They threw all this fame and name recognition at us, and Amnesty is still doing whats right, she said. That was super exciting. The fight has become, Liesl Gerntholtz of Human Rights Watch says, the most contentious and divisive issue in todays womens movement.The battle lines among American feminists over selling sex were drawn in the 1970s. On one side were radical feminists like the writer Andrea Dworkin and the lawyer and legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon. They were the early abolitionists, condemning prostitution, along with pornography and sexual violence, as the most virulent and powerful sources of womens oppression. Ive tried to voice the protest against a power that is dead weight on you, fist and penis organized to keep you quiet, wrote Dworkin, who sold sex briefly around the age of 19, when she ran out of money on a visit to Europe.Other feminists, who called themselves sex positive, saw sex workers as subverters of patriarchy, not as victims. On Mothers Day 1973, a 35-year-old former call girl named Margo St. James founded a group in San Francisco called Coyote, for Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics. Its goal was to decriminalize prostitution, as a feminist act. In its heyday, Coyote threw annual Hookers Balls, where drag queens and celebrities mixed with politicians and police. It was a party: In 1978, a crowd of 20,000 filled the citys Cow Palace, and St. James entered riding an elephant.By the 1980s, Dworkins argument condemning prostitution moved into the feminist mainstream, with the support of Gloria Steinem, who began rejecting the term sex work. St. James and the sex-positivists were relegated to the fringes.The abolitionists moved into the fight against global labor trafficking in the 1990s, focusing on sex trafficking, though most estimates suggest that the majority of trafficking victims are forced into domestic, agricultural or construction work. The abolitionists wanted to erase the traditional legal distinction between forced and consensual prostitution by cracking down on all of it as trafficking. In 1998, they tried to persuade President Bill Clinton  and Hillary Clinton, who was the honorary chairwoman of the Clinton administrations council on women  to adopt their broad definition in an international crime treaty and a federal trafficking bill. It was a striking effort to expand and stiffen criminal punishment, a strategy Elizabeth Bernstein, a Barnard sociologist who studies sex work and trafficking, termed carceral feminism. Abolitionists have relied upon strategies of incarceration as their chief tool of justice, she wrote in 2007. They lost the fight to define all prostitution as trafficking during the Clinton administration. Those were depressing years, Donna Hughes, an abolitionist researcher and womens studies professor at the University of Rhode Island, said in an interview in National Review in 2006.When George W. Bush was elected in 2000, Hughes and other abolitionists formed a coalition with faith-based groups, including evangelical Republicans, to lobby the new president. The Bush administration funded Christian groups, like the International Justice Mission, to rescue girls and women abroad. I.J.M. helped to raid brothels in Cambodia, Thailand and India, working with local police officers who broke down doors while American TV cameras rolled. Donations poured in to I.J.M. from the United States.But local human rights and womens groups complained about the tactic. After some raids by police forces in India and Indonesia, girls and women were deported, detained in abusive institutions and coerced into sex with the police, according to a 2005 bulletin by the World Health Organization and the Global Coalition on Women and AIDS. Two years earlier, when I.J.M. reported that there were minors in a brothel in Thailand, the police raided it and locked the women who were working there in an orphanage. The women strung together bedsheets to escape from a second-story window.Franoise Girard was director of the public-health program at the Open Society Foundations when she met with Gary Haugen, the leader of I.J.M., and Holly Burkhalter, a senior adviser, in 2007. I.J.M. said, If we can save one girl, its worth it, says Girard, who is now president of the International Womens Health Coalition. I said, What happens to the girls? And they couldnt answer. Burkhalter says she doesnt remember Girards question, but the police did not permit I.J.M. to go on the raid in Thailand. If we had, it would have gone much better, she says, adding that now, when I.J.M. helps with raids, each victim has a case worker.The Bush administration also funded abolitionist research on the harmful effects of prostitution, prominently featuring references to that work on the State Departments website. Hughes, the abolitionist womens-studies professor, denounced strip clubs and lap-dancing in a 2005 report on trafficking that was funded with more than $100,000 from the State Department. Melissa Farley, a psychologist who received Bush funds, wrote in 2000 in the journal Women and Criminal Justice that any woman who claimed to have chosen prostitution was acting pathologically  enjoyment of domination and rape are in her nature. Non-abolitionist researchers criticized her for presenting the brutal harm of some experiences of prostitution as the near-universal reality without solid evidence.In part as a response to lobbying by feminist abolitionists and evangelicals, in 2003 Congress barred groups that aided trafficking victims from receiving federal funds if they supported the legalization or practice of prostitution. The same year, President Bush committed $15 billion to the international fight against AIDS, but required all recipients of the funding to sign an anti-prostitution pledge. The result was a head-on collision between AIDS prevention and abolitionist ideas. Brazil turned down $40 million in American funds. Sangram, a public-health and human rights organization that was distributing condoms in Sangli, a red-light district in rural southern India, refused to sign the pledge and returned American funds in 2005, at a time when U.N.AIDS cited it as a trusted source on H.I.V. and human rights. We were distributing 350,000 condoms a month, says Meena Seshu, the director of Sangram, who has a masters degree in social work and has published in The Lancet and won an award from Human Rights Watch. Do you actually work with people, or do you give them morals? That was the choice.The Obama administration continues to fund organizations involved in rescue missions. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the anti-prostitution pledge for groups in the United States, ruling that it violated their free-speech rights. But the decision didnt apply to foreign groups, which still cannot receive federal funding to fight AIDS if they support the sex-workers rights movement.The current debate over sex work in the United States is often framed as a choice between international legal systems. Abolitionists embrace what they call the Swedish (or Nordic) model. In 1999, at the urging of feminists, Swedens Parliament passed the Sex Purchase Act, making it a crime to buy sex. Prostitution itself had not been a crime, but the new law deemed it a serious harm both to individuals and to society, giving the legislation a moral underpinning and aiming to flush the johns out of the Baltic, as a media campaign declared. A decade later, Sweden announced a reduction in street prostitution by as much as 50 percent and proclaimed the law a success. Though no one had recorded data on street prostitution before the law passed, the claimed drop became the chief selling point for a system that punished men. Yet online advertising for sex increased in Sweden, leading researchers to conclude that the small market was shifting indoors. Norway and Iceland adopted the Swedish model in 2009, and in the last two years, Canada and Northern Ireland enacted modified versions.Sex-worker activists reject this model. People think the Swedish state criminalized clients, and not us, because they cared about us, but that was not the case, says Pye Jakobsson, a Swedish sex worker who is the president of the Global Network of Sex Work Projects. The law is about protecting society, and were seen as a threat. Some sex workers say that criminalizing male behavior pushes them to take greater risks. Women who worked on the street used to have safe spots where they would tell the client to drive, Jakobsson explains. Now clients say no, because of the police. They want to go someplace else remote. How can the woman be safe there? In December, a Bulgarian sex worker was found brutally murdered in a deserted parking lot at the harbor in Oslo. Her friends  also migrants from the Balkan States, like many women selling sex in Sweden and Norway  looked for her when she went missing. But they did not go to the police until they found her body.When the police investigate whether a man has bought sex, they use it as a reason to check womens documents, says May-Len Skilbrei, a criminology and sociology professor at the University of Oslo. She says that these inspections can lead to deportations. Sex workers also face the possibility of losing custody of their children and being evicted. If the police tell the landlord they think youre escorting out of your apartment, he has to evict you, or he could be prosecuted, Skilbrei says. The Norwegian police called a long-running Oslo crackdown on prostitution Operation Homeless.The Swedish government has been clear that it considers the problems the law causes for sex workers an acceptable form of deterrence, reporting in 2010 that the negative effects must be viewed as positive from the perspective that the purpose of the law is indeed to combat prostitution. When France adopted the Swedish model in April, the bills sponsor in Parliament said one goal was to change mentalities. On social media, American sex workers poured out their sympathy for their French sisters, who were marching in protest.Sweden may not be a relevant model for the United States, where the kind of hardship that often pushes people into street-level sex work is more widespread and the safety net much weaker. The difference is relevant, says Rachel Lloyd, the founder and C.E.O. of Girls Educational and Mentoring Services (GEMS), based in Central Harlem, which helps about 400 girls and young women in New York annually who have been involved in prostitution. She opposes legalization, because she thinks it will increase trafficking. She visited Stockholm two years ago and found it significant that there are so many family services, that few teenagers are in foster care and that most have access to state-funded universities. I came away thinking: In the U.S., were not there, she says about adopting the Swedish model. We dont have the social services. Lloyd says that not enough of the tens of millions of dollars in government funds and donations in the United States that go to fight trafficking are used for services, like housing for teenagers leaving foster care; 70 percent of GEMS members have been in that system. When youre trying to move forward, you need an apartment, Lloyd says. You need to go to school. (In Sweden, she was also surprised to learn that men who are caught buying sex are fined rather than arrested, paying an amount that depends on their income and generally ranges from $300 to $4500, according to a news report.)Australia has adopted a very different legal model from Swedens. In 1999, the Australian state of New South Wales repealed its criminal laws against prostitution, freeing consenting adults to buy and sell sex and allowing brothels to operate much like other businesses. (Other Australian states have a variety of laws.) Four years later, New Zealand implemented full decriminalization. Abolitionists predicted explosive growth of prostitution. But the number of sex workers stayed flat, at about 6,000 in New Zealand and somewhat more in New South Wales. Condom use among sex workers rose above 99 percent, according to government surveys. Sex workers in brothels in New South Wales report the same level of depression and stress as women in the general population; rates are far higher for women who work on the street, who are also often intravenous drug users. While the New Zealand government has found no evidence that sex workers are being trafficked across the countrys border, last November, the Parliament of New South Wales gave the police more power to monitor brothels, after reports that some were linked to organized crime and prosecutions for sexual servitude and exploitation. One involved a Thai woman who was recruited in Bangkok and told she would learn to be a hairdresser.A couple of years ago, a Seattle dominatrix and outspoken activist who goes by the name Mistress Matisse flew to Australia for three weeks and spent a week working. I just had to see what it was like, she says. At home, she writes for The Stranger, Seattles alternative weekly, and frequently tweets about the practice and politics of sex work to her 27,000 Twitter followers.In Australia, Matisse worked at a small brothel called the Golden Apple (small bar, six bedrooms) in Sydney, which is in New South Wales, and a larger one called Gotham City. I thought: I wont be Mistress Matisse. Ill just be a girl doing full service  intercourse  which I hadnt done for years, she says. She saw three or four clients a night and then went to the beach.Matisse contrasted working in Australia with working in a brothel in Nevada several years ago. She much preferred Australia. Nevada limits legal prostitution to a small number of brothels in rural areas, and they are subject to strict licensing requirements. In Australia, you go home every night, and you can have a cigarette, go on a date, stay in a normal head space, Matisse said. In Nevada, you had to be in the brothel 24/7. It was like a cross between summer camp and a womens prison. Most prostitution in the state takes place illegally outside the brothels, in Las Vegas and Reno, with more freedom but also more risk.Germany has a similar two-tiered market. The country became a growing destination for sex tourism after introducing in 2002 new regulations for the legal sex trade, with an estimated 400,000 sex workers. Migrant women working underground, some of whom are lured into crossing the border, face the same threat of deportation as in Sweden. Meanwhile, licensing requirements raised the cost of setting up brothels, favoring chains and big businesses, including a 12-story, neon-lit brothel in Cologne. Whats strange is how industrial the brothels are, says Skilbrei, the professor at the University of Oslo. They control the women, for example with health checks. Thats not the model sex workers are fighting for, because it diminishes their autonomy.Amnesty distinguishes the laws in Germany (and the Netherlands, where sex work is legal but regulated by local authorities) from those in New Zealand and Australia, which place greater control into the hands of sex workers to operate independently, self-organize in informal cooperatives and control their own working environments, the human rights group states. Melissa Farley, the psychologist and abolitionist researcher, rejects all of these models. The state functions as a pimp, collecting taxes, which I consider blood money, she wrote in an email last December. In the most recent government research, a 2008 survey of 770 sex workers by the New Zealand government, most reported that they were not likely to report violence to the police, which the government attributed to their sense of stigma. Farley sees this as proof that wherever prostitution exists, the harm goes with it, regardless of legal status.To Amnesty, the lesson is that decriminalization isnt like flipping a switch  it takes time for attitudes to shift. There are signs that this has begun: In the 2008 New Zealand survey, 40 percent of sex workers also said they felt a sense of camaraderie and belonging, suggesting that their relationships with one another may provide an antidote to stigma. Annah Pickering, who does street outreach for the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective, describes a more recent dynamic with the police that would be unthinkable almost anywhere else. We used to wave the police down for help, and theyd keep driving, but now they take sex workers complaints seriously, she said. She told me about an incident in South Auckland last year. One client negotiated with a street worker; she did the act, and he refused to pay. She waved a cop down, and he told the client he had to pay and took him to the A.T.M. to get the money.Sixty years ago, after Gloria Steinem graduated from Smith College, she spent two years in India on a fellowship observing village-based land reform. Returning to the country in 2014, she called prostitution commercial rape, making headlines. Until recently, Indian feminists shared Steinems views of prostitution, but many have gradually shifted their thinking. In 2014, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, the chairwoman of Indias National Commission on Women, came out in favor of decriminalization, saying it would help protect sex workers from violence and improve their health care. Reaction within India was mixed. But the refusal of Americans like Steinem to rethink their broad-brush condemnation of sex work, or the wisdom of rescue tactics, angers some feminists there. Why have you locked yourself into saving sex workers in India and not engaged with the larger womens movement? asked Geeta Misra, who runs the human rights group C.R.E.A. in New Delhi, which tries to build feminist leadership and expand sexual and reproductive freedom.The debate shifted in India largely because of the role of the countrys sex-worker collectives, which are among the largest in the world, and which exert a social and political force that has no parallel in the United States. Founded in the early 1990s, the collectives first proved adept at helping to slow the spread of H.I.V. Melinda Gates went to Sonagachi, the red-light district in the city of Kolkata, in 2004 and wrote in The Seattle Times about a sex worker named Gita and her peers, who have helped to increase condom use from zero to 70 percent in their district, and to reduce H.I.V. infection rates to 7 percent  compared with rates as high as 66 percent among sex workers elsewhere. Gates concluded by announcing that the foundation she created with her husband, Bill Gates, would spend $200 million to fight H.I.V. in India, an amount later raised to $338 million.The sex-worker collective in Sonagachi, the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (D.M.S.C., the Unstoppable Women Committee), now has 65,000 members and runs schools for the children of sex workers, who often face discrimination, and has established banks where sex workers can open accounts. In rural Sangli, 6,000 people belong to Veshya Anyay Mukti Parishad (or VAMP, Sex Workers Fight Injustice), an offshoot of Sangram, the public-health group.While its illegal to own a brothel or sell sex on the street in India, indoor prostitution is not against the law. Enforcement is uneven, and the police sometimes demand sex or bribes. Nevertheless, the relationship between the police and sex workers can approach a tenuous dtente that allows the collectives to assert themselves. A project of the Gates Foundation, from 2005 until 2011, used the collective model to organize 60,000 sex workers in Karnataka. They brought in peer educators to talk to the police and lawyers to teach sex workers about their rights not to be harassed and, often, not to be arrested. As arrests dropped, so did violence by the police, pimps and clients, along with the H.I.V. rate, according to a study last year in The Journal of the International AIDS Society.Human rights advocates, including Amnesty, think the sex-worker collectives are a far better means of preventing trafficking and under-age prostitution than brothel raids. D.M.S.C. and VAMP run screening boards in Sonagachi and Sangli, which interview women who are new to the district, asking if theyve entered the sex trade willingly and sometimes checking birth certificates for proof that the women are at least 18 (partly out of self-interest, because older women often dont want to compete with younger ones). Its not a perfect system by any means. Among other shortcomings, high-end brothels in Sonagachi, run by people called agrawalis, dont participate in the collectives condom distribution, say researchers, including Prabha Kotiswaran, a faculty member at Kings College, London, who conducted months of field work in Sonagachi for her book Dangerous Sex, Invisible Labor. The agrawalis are a source of under-age trafficking, Kotiswaran says. At other brothels, however, she saw D.M.S.C.s staff trying to help girls leave and find better options than state-run protective custody, where they often wind up after raids. Thats a nightmare, like prison, Kotiswaran says.Indian feminists want poor women to have alternatives for making a decent living, but they are hard to come by. Kotiswaran found that women could make roughly six times as much doing sex work in Sonagachi as they could at a garment factory. In one study in 2011 of more than 5,000 women across India, only 3 percent said they were forced into the sex trade, and only 10 percent said they freely chose it. The rest fell into the gray area in between, giving reasons related to poverty or issues like domestic violence or desertion.In any other context, American feminists would celebrate tens of thousands of women organizing to improve their lives. But Steinem expresses deep suspicion of the Indian sex-worker collectives. D.M.S.C. has enabled the sex industry to attract millions of dollars from the Gates Foundation, creating a big new source of income for brothel owners, pimps and traffickers, she wrote in the newspaper The Hindu in 2012. Last fall, in an interview with Esquire, she called the foundations work in India a disaster and said there was no evidence that women have the power to make men use condoms. (Through a spokesman, the Gates Foundation declined to comment.) Yet studies have shown large jumps in condom use when sex workers organize, and the annual rate of new H.I.V. infections in India has fallen by half.Steinems guide in Sonagachi, and during part of her 2014 trip, was Ruchira Gupta, an Indian former journalist who founded a group called Apne Aap, which tries to help women leave sex work and has helped the police raid brothels. Gupta has strong ties with American abolitionists. She received funding from the State Department during the Bush administration, won a Clinton Global Citizen Award in 2009 and is scheduled to receive an honorary degree from Smith College this month. Steinem is on Apne Aaps advisory board. Nicholas Kristof, an opinion columnist for The New York Times who has gone on brothel raids (including one in Cambodia that he live-tweeted), has called Gupta a brilliant social entrepreneur. When I asked Gupta about the Gates Foundations work preventing AIDS, she said: Theyre thinking about the 45-year-old man who is the client. Instead of protecting women and girls from rapists, they protect the men from AIDS. Gupta similarly denounced Amnesty and Human Rights Watch: They see a little girl in a brothel and think its fine, if we give her a condom. Rachel Moran, author of the recent memoir Paid For, who calls herself a survivor of prostitution in Ireland, also says that Amnesty International has taken their views directly from pimps and traffickers. Amnesty categorically denies these accusations, explaining that it consulted sex workers along with doing extensive research. We recognize that harm can occur in sex work, but to characterize the sex-workers rights movement as a front for pimps is really shocking, Catherine Murphy of Amnesty says.Steinem declined to talk to me. Her assistant said she would defer to Gupta as her source on this subject. Human rights advocates question Guptas approach because of the complexity of sex work in India. Many women who sell sex do so alone or in small groups, out of homes or in side streets, truck stops, parks or railway stops. Some rent rooms from women who have done or continue to do sex work. Those women are often the ones arrested on charges of brothel-keeping or trafficking, says Siddharth Dube, a public-health expert and former senior adviser at U.N.AIDS who writes extensively about sex work in India in a memoir, No One Else. He adds, And this is a disaster, because this is a helpless impoverished woman in her 40s or 50s trying to survive.There is another side to prostitution in India, which Dube says is far less prevalent: Small rural communities in which, for some families, prostitution is intergenerational, and women or girls are expected to enter the trade. These are some of the most difficult places in which to fight trafficking. You must try, Dube says. But youre walking into a very complex and explosive situation where you can make huge errors of judgment in identifying who is a trafficker. Like everyone I spoke to, he opposes under-age prostitution. But to address it, you cant just have raids in a slipshod way or seek publicity. You have to really painstakingly try to solve these problems with the community.Apne Aap concentrates much of its work in these kinds of communities and has brought in the media to cover raids and intergenerational prostitution. But one TV segment, The Fallen Women of Perna, which was broadcast on the TV show India Today, provoked beatings by some family members of some of the girls and women who appeared on the show, according to former American and European interns and Indian staff members of Apne Aap who wrote letters criticizing the organization in 2014. They sent the letters to Apne Aaps main funder, the NoVo Foundation in New York, founded by Warren Buffetts son Peter.Gupta questioned whether the beatings occurred and said that if they did, it wasnt because of Apne Aap. She told me she hated the shows title, but the group promoted the segment, which included an interview with her. Through the use of occasional media, Gupta says, we frighten the local authorities not to collude with the traffickers, and we frighten the traffickers to think what theyre doing will go public.The former Apne Aap employees also wrote that there is a disconnect between the organizations head office and the needs and voices of the field offices and the girls and women they aim to serve. After the letters, Apne Aap ended the international intern program. It also stopped renting an expensive office and house in Delhi, far from its field work, and hired Dalberg Development Associates to assess its impact over the previous five years. Dalberg praised Apne Aaps work bringing women together, providing legal training and, in particular, helping to place children at risk of prostitution in residential schools, but recommended that the group reduce or delink direct involvement in brothel rescues.Apne Aap is halfway through receiving a two-year $700,000 grant from the NoVo Foundation. In an email, NoVo said it continued to support the organization out of concern for the marginalized girls and women who rely on Apne Aap for essential services. The American support, in particular by Steinem, for Apne Aaps model saddens and frustrates Indian feminists who promote the sex-worker collectives. Gloria Steinem was one of our icons, says Meena Seshu of Sangram. We really looked up to her. Why doesnt she come and listen to the people here, with respect and dignity?A few years ago, VAMP, the Sangli collective, made a short film, Save Us From Saviors. On camera, a leader in the collective named Shabana says: I started doing sex work when I was 12 years old. One of my sisters was burnt to death. I might also have been killed, so I ran away. In the next shot, dressed in a bright yellow sari, she sits with her two children, and one of them kisses her on the head. It is only recently that Ive started thinking its good that Im in sex work, Shabana says. I dont have to depend on anyone for anything.What would decriminalization in the United States look like, if the sex-workers rights movement got its way? Its hard to apply lessons from other countries. Some activists think the best way to find out would be to start with a local experiment. You need one place to try it, Meg Muoz said to me, mentioning the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. You need the right testing environment. Its not clear where that would be, though; San Francisco voters rejected a decriminalization referendum by a wide margin in 2008.The way decriminalization might play out probably lies in the unsexy details of implementation. Cities could use zoning ordinances to address concerns about the effects on residential neighborhoods by confining brothels, like strip clubs, to industrial areas and limiting their size. Trafficking and promoting under-age prostitution would remain crimes. People could work discreetly in their own homes or hotels without fear of reprisal. The sex industry could become safer, as activists hope. Its also possible that the sex trade would grow, as abolitionists warn, especially if one area turned into a sex-tourism hot spot.Until now, abolitionist ideas about punishing men and treating women as victims have dominated legal reform in the United States. Seattle, for example, has announced a shift toward arresting male clients and connecting sex workers with services. But sex workers I spoke to around the country, in a variety of life circumstances, raised questions about how punishing buyers would make their lives better; they would still be participating in illegal transactions and have something to hide. An older escort told me that if she didnt dread exposure and losing her business, she would report under-age prostitution and trafficking to the police if she witnessed it.Three years ago in New York, abolitionists encouraged the establishment of Human Trafficking Intervention Courts for people arrested on prostitution charges. Judges mandate services like counseling to address trauma and can dismiss charges against those who attend and arent rearrested. Its better than having a criminal record, sex workers and their advocates say, but women who dont comply can still end up in jail, and some of those who attend say they resent being forced into the mandated counseling. The courts also authorize pretrial detention, sending women to jail to protect them from men in their lives, if a judge deems it necessary, or simply to prevent their immediate return to prostitution. These courts are an experiment in penal welfare because they repackage criminal intervention as social services, argues Kate Mogulescu, the founder and supervising attorney of the Exploitation Intervention Project at the Legal Aid Society. A few months before the trafficking courts opened, New York State passed a bawdy house law, making it easier for prosecutors to institute eviction proceedings for prostitution if landlords do not.Last spring, with support from abolitionists and conservatives (the same coalition from the days of the Bush administration), Congress passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which makes the crime of buying sex from a trafficking victim equivalent to sex trafficking itself. The maximum sentence is 99 years in prison. Rachel Lloyd of GEMS thinks the emphasis of reform should be on helping girls and women, not increasing penalties for men who pay for sex. In 2008, she helped pass a safe-harbor law, which treats juveniles in prostitution as victims, rather than criminals, in New York. (More than half the states have such laws.)Talking to sex workers across the country, in a variety of life circumstances, I heard a range of feelings about what they do. A self-described East Indian courtesan in New York said she loved playing a role, developing a fantasy we can both walk into out of our mundane lives. A dominatrix who lives on the Upper East Side told me she sometimes felt good about making an emotional connection. Then her tone changed. But God, I hate putting on the strap-on. A woman in Brooklyn said her clients meant nothing to her. I only care about my kids, she said. This is about providing for them. Mistress Matisse, the Seattle dominatrix, treats some clients as friends; one does her taxes, and another, an exterminator, checks her house for bugs. She raised thousands of dollars from clients and online donors to help a woman named Heather in West Virginia, who told me she hated sex work but was doing it to buy heroin, pay for living expenses and go into drug treatment. If you dont want to do this work, you shouldnt have to, Mistress Matisse told me. I can see how it would bruise your heart. Other women, sounding numb or even traumatized, said that they had to dissociate to get through their time with clients. Ceyenne, an activist who was arrested a few years ago while doing fetish work in New Jersey, said, Mentally and physically, its a lot to carry. She wrote a memoir, and she speaks regularly to L.G.B.T. youth groups. When I talk to these girls coming up now, I tell them to reach for more.The traditional feminist argument against decriminalization is that legitimizing prostitution will harm women by leading to more sexual inequality. The human rights argument for it is that it will make peoples lives better, and safer. In this fight over whose voices to listen to, who speaks for whom and when to use the power of criminal law, the sex-workers rights movement is a rebellion against punishment and shame. It demands respect for a group that has rarely received it, insisting that you can only really help people if you respect them."}
{"text": "It was an act of desperation that led us to write the email. My wife and I felt overwhelmed and hopeless. Two years into our marriage, we began discussing the possibility of seeking professional help. The problem was our home.We had finally acquired some furniture, including a dining table and chairs, a credenza, a properly proportioned couch and a side table. Considering I had lived as a single man with little more than an overlarge sofa and a TV on the floor, it was a big improvement. But our rental apartment still wasnt coming together.Framed art sat on the floor because we didnt know where to hang it. The furniture floated independently with no cohesion. We went to stores and shopped online, but the thought of buying anything caused paralysis: We feared wed make a costly mistake.In the bathroom, I had already painted the walls glossy black years earlier, a decorating disaster. The space also lacked storage and needed a new recessed medicine cabinet. Neither of us are Bob Vila types. These were jobs for a decorator and potentially a contractor. But we had no clue how to find reputable professionals.Then my wife, Cara, came home one day and told me about a service she had heard about. It offered a free consultation with an interior designer who comes to your home, discusses your goals and creates a plan. If you hire the designer, you pay by the hour.I had stubbornly held on to the idea that if we studied enough shelter magazines, we could pull together our space ourselves. But its at your lowest point that youre sometimes willing to try something new.O.K., lets contact Homepolish, I finally said.Homepolish was founded in 2012 by the 24-year-old Stanford graduate Noa Santos and his partner, Will Nathan. Mr. Santos, a business and architecture major, moved to New York for a job at a high-end residential design firm. Within weeks, he said, he knew two things: He loved design, and his chosen profession was terribly obsolete.Mr. Santos, now 27, thought the traditional commission structure gave designers an incentive to inflate budgets, breeding distrust among clients and creating unnecessary drama. And he disliked the way talented staff members often worked for years for a big-name designer without a chance to establish their own reputations or firms.Mr. Santos also noticed that when friends and people he met discovered what he did, they were desperate for advice.It was this light bulb in my head, he said. Why is everyone so eager for me to help them? They didnt have access to this anywhere else.Soon after, Mr. Santos quit his job and started Homepolish with Mr. Nathan, to give designers access to clients and provide clients with accessible design expertise.Initially, Mr. Santos was the only designer. But before long the roster had grown to 60, and now there are more than 500 designers affiliated with the company. Some have recently graduated from design school; others have years of experience and are moonlighting or testing the waters to go out on their own.The process is akin to online dating. Prospective clients log on to the website, enter basic information (location, budget, goals, preferred style) and are matched by one of the companys queen bees with a designer suited to their project. A free consultation follows, either in person at home or via Skype.If clients dont think they jibe with the Homepolish designer, they notify the queen bee and  as simply as swiping on Tinder  are rematched. (The queen bee also acts as a go-between if any problems arise during the design process.)Once a match is made, clients can buy either a single-day session (three hours) for $349 or a set number of hours, which are bought in chunks of five, starting with a 10-hour minimum, at an hourly rate of $130.I dont presume $130 an hour is affordable for everyone, Mr. Santos said. We say its accessible. Our clients typically make as a household $100,000, and they typically have $10,000 to spend on a project.Homepolish has opened up personal design to this large segment of professionals who, though successful by most measures, were nevertheless previously unable to afford most decorators. Chris Wallgren and his partner, Brijen Shah, fit the category.Mr. Wallgren, 38, is a consultant for public transportation agencies; Dr. Shah, 39, is a doctor at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. The couple bought a two-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side three years ago, and after a few tentative furniture purchases, grew frustrated trying to decorate the place themselves.Im at a stage in my life where I dont want this to look like college, Mr. Wallgren said.But when the couple interviewed designers and architects, they were stunned, Mr. Wallgren said. The decorator comes to your apartment and says, O.K., this is going to cost a hundred grand, he said. You need a $30,000 couch.Instead, on a friends recommendation, they tried Homepolish. During the initial consultation, the designer they were matched with rearranged some furniture. It was an immediate improvement and set the couple at ease about spending money. The designer projected a $25,000 budget and 50 hours of work.Thats what he estimated, and thats what he stuck to, Mr. Wallgren said, adding that it was a collaborative, largely stress-free process that resulted in a home that feels complete.Haley Weidenbaum, a 28-year-old designer in Los Angeles who has become something of a star within the Homepolish stable, said the loose approach was what made the process feel collaborative and unintimidating.Usually at a firm, its more than one person on a project, Ms. Weidenbaum said. This feels more personal and less business-y. The client just feels like, Oh, this person is helping me with my home.Ms. Weidenbaum is juggling around 20 projects at the moment, and while many of them are for young professionals and first-time homeowners (Ive done a lot of nurseries, she said), she also works with some very wealthy clients.Twenty years ago, if you lived in Bel Air, youd hire the top designer and theyd do everything custom, she said. In the last 10 years, magazines and blogs have shown you dont need to pay three times as much to make your home look good.My wife and I hope thats true. We were paired with a young designer, Michelle Zacks, who was a clothing designer for many years before switching to interiors, working for a Brooklyn firm and later as an assistant prop stylist.She came over one evening, and we discussed our goals: a renovated bathroom, a living room that looks pulled together, more lighting and a non-Ikea storage solution for my record collection.My wife liked her energy, and I liked that she humored me by looking through my giant stack of shelter magazine tear sheets. We agreed to the initial 10-hour buy-in, with the possibility of buying more hours and increasing our $5,000 budget as the project goes along.So far, so good. When we met with Ms. Zacks to go over lighting and storage solutions she had sourced, she showed that she understood our style. She also arranged for a reasonably priced contractor to look at our bathroom and give us a quote, which we have accepted.Its comforting to know that we can go in baby steps, without committing too much time or money upfront. And as Ms. Weidenbaum said, the process feels informal, as if a friend with good taste and connections is helping us get our place together.For Mr. Santos, the Homepolish co-founder, thats the whole point.People find the task so daunting, he said. Its such a big spend. What people want is a design partner.That, and a living room where the art is off the floor and on the walls.Other online services that take the fear out of decorating.Homeowners can get per room online design services by filling out a style questionnaire and uploading pictures of the space that needs a makeover. One of Havenlys designers will email custom concept boards and product suggestions. Prices start at $79 a room. www.havenly.comThis service is similar to Havenly in that it pairs clients with designers, and the process happens online. The basic package (two concept boards, a furniture layout and a personalized shopping list) costs $299 a room. For $1,299 a room, you get those benefits and extras like a 30-minute phone call with a design assistant. www.decorist.com"}
{"text": "When Caitlyn Jenner was first emerging from the shell of gold medalist Bruce Jenner, Americans were riveted, voyeuristic  and surprisingly accepting.So much has changed since then. Hesitant acceptance of transgender people has dissolved into a national furor over bathroom laws. And among liberals, initial enthusiasm for Jenner faded with the discovery that she is a Republican who admired Ted Cruz!I accompanied Jenner as she visited a Brooklyn school, the Academy for Young Writers, that is in a gritty, working-class neighborhood and that has been a leader in making L.G.B.T. students feel welcome. The meeting was a collision of sorts: a wealthy transgender celebrity encountering a group of low-income L.G.B.T. teenagers of color, coming from different worlds but sharing anxieties and pain.The students challenged Jenner, and some had earlier pulled down a photo of Jenner from a wall because they felt she wasnt doing enough for L.G.B.T. people. Jenner spoke with the students for hours, winning them over by airing differences (and taking selfies with them) while also bonding over common concerns  like the North Carolina bathroom law.Its a total misunderstanding of the issue, Jenner said, arguing that there are already laws to deal with predators and that there have been no reported case of a trans woman ever entering a womens restroom and abusing anyone.There are three Republicans who have been arrested in mens bathrooms for lewd behavior, Jenner noted. So, you know, maybe we should kind of ban the Republicans from going in there!The real people to worry about, she said, are trans kids who are struggling with bullying and ostracism. One national study found that 41 percent of trans people surveyed had attempted suicide, 57 percent had experienced family rejection and almost one-fifth had endured homelessness.And now the state joins in the bullying and the harassment, Jenner added. You will lose lives because of it in our community.Some of the students in the room have faced just these challenges. Spencer Washington, a black 17-year-old who was assumed female at birth but has felt male since he was a toddler, once attempted suicide (fortunately, he couldnt manage a hangmans knot and cried himself to sleep).Let people pee in peace, Spencer pleaded.Jenner said she was working behind the scenes to address the North Carolina law and criticized Republicans on that issue. But she was unapologetic about being a Republican, saying that she was conservative on economic issues. (For my part, I believe in being accepting not just of transgender people but also of Republicans!)Less than 1 percent of the population  one rough estimate is perhaps one-third of 1 percent  is transgender, a far smaller share than is gay. Jenner thus puts a face on a category of people prone to be vilified, a group that may be among the most marginalized in America.Maybe this is the reason God put me on this earth, to tell my story, to try to make a difference in the world, Jenner said. Because this story and this issue  trans, gender identity, nonconforming, whatever it may be  is bigger than what I did back in 76 and winning the Games. Its bigger than breaking world records and doing all that kind of stuff. This is about life. This is about life and death. People destroy their lives over what we all kind of deal with.Jenner says that the hardest thing about coming out as a woman was the criticisms from the transgender community, and she acknowledges she had a lot to learn: Until a year ago, she had never met a transgender person. But she says she finally feels authentic about her identity.For so many years, little Caitlyn has lived inside, she said. And Bruce kind of took over the world, and did his thing. It was time to put him inside and lets let her live, O.K.?I became interested in these issues after coming across homeless kids struggling with school, drugs, police, sexual abuse and suicide  and disproportionately they were transgender kids who had been rejected by family and society.Thats what I think the public doesnt get: Sure, there are complicated issues of which sports team a child should be on, or which shower to use, but those are secondary. The primary concern should be to keep kids safe and alive  and not in crisis each time their bladders fill.So remember, this isnt about Jenner, who can look after herself. Its about the thousands of kids across the country who, on top of all the craziness of adolescence, are also realizing, often to their horror, that their bodies and souls do not align, and that as a result they may face a lifetime as pariahs. We can do better than that.Lets listen to Spencer, who says, I just want to be loved for who I am."}
{"text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.  On a picture-perfect Wednesday morning, mayors, city leaders and advocates huddled in unremarkable hotel conference rooms in here, to discuss something disturbing and seemingly intractable: violence among  and the violent deaths of  young black boys and men.It was the third annual convening of Cities United, the group President Obama praised in the 2014 announcement of his My Brothers Keeper initiative as a bipartisan group of mayors who have made improving the lives and outcomes of young black men a priority in communities across the country.And they continue to do so, this year meeting under the mantra The Fierce Urgency of Now, a phrase made famous decades ago by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.And yet the ferocity and urgency for this cause among the broader public and the news media remain elusive.In the wake of the incredible level of attention garnered last year by citizens who were rightly outraged by state violence  often at the hands of law enforcement, directed disproportionately at black citizens  the issue of community violence receded.When it did surface, it was often used as a cudgel against activists like those supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.The message was invariably some version of: If black lives really mattered, activists would focus on black-on-black violence instead.The implication being that there is something pathologically broken about blackness that makes black people prone to self-destruction, and that attention to anything else is a minor diversion from a larger truth.But in fact, this argument is the diversion.Both state violence and community violence are problems, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. One exacerbating factor of community violence is the present and historical factors that helped form the communities and created the conditions for violence.It is not hard to explain, as many have, how every level of government, and by extension society itself, used every possible lever of power for centuries to create the conditions in black communities that now make fertile ground for violence.This is not to say that personal choice plays no role, but rather that human beings make choices within an environmental context, which at its base level is affected by state and federal policy.Our society treated black bodies as disposable, if not bound for eradication. Generations of educational, employment, housing, lending and criminal justice policies form the substrata roots of this problem, and they are deeper and more complex than the visible weed of community violence that is so tall and tangled.Even urban infrastructure like highways were used as a tool to distance and destroy black neighborhoods, as Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx explained in March at the Center for American Progress. As Foxx put it, The growing gaps between the wealthy, the poor and the middle class have been exacerbated by our transportation system, and Attitudes about race and the poor have been embedded in our infrastructure for far too long.The roads to Americas prosperity either plowed through black and poor communities or were literally designed to pass them by.It is easy to argue that these policies took centuries to carve their scars and will likely take a long time to heal (that is, once the country truly decides to begin that healing, instead of plunging the shiv deeper into the wound).But that is the long view. What do we do now, in the short term, about the disproportionate number of black lives caught in a vortex of violence? What do we do in the meantime? In the space between where we are and where we must arrive, how do we stop filling the cemeteries with the bodies of ever more young black men?At the Cities United meeting, I discussed this dilemma with Mayor Betsy Hodges of Minneapolis, a city recently caught up in a storm of protests over the shooting death of Jamar Clark, a young black man, by police officers who were not charged in his killing.That case drew national attention. What drew less attention are numbers supplied to me by a senior policy aide in Mayor Hodgess office: a 78 percent rise so far this year in gunshot wound victims, with a 153 percent rise in the Fourth Precinct alone, the precinct in which Jamar was killed.Mayor Hodges talked passionately about addressing universal issues and treating violence as a public health issue. She advocated dealing with upstream issues like stable housing and trauma. But the more she spoke, the more I was reminded of the enormity of the problem we as a society have created and continue to face.Our policies, disinvestment and avoidance have created a sort of perpetual motion machine in which violence has become increasingly difficult to stanch.That dilemma encapsulates both the fierce urgency of now and the plodding monotony of it.Maybe the only way to think about this is bifurcated: on the one hand, in small, doable first steps; and on the other, in grand philosophical truths. As Mayor William Bell of Birmingham stressed to me, we have to talk across differences  ideological and generational  to find the center of our collective moral authority. From that point progress, and the path to it, becomes clearer.Possibly.But for me, in this moment, its important to first find a way of accepting that we can both protest state violence and detest community violence  and not let either discussion deprive the other of oxygen."}
{"text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C.  Adam Scott has a daughter, his firstborn, who will be 18 months old this summer. After careful consideration, he decided his child should take precedence over the baby conceived by an abbreviation-heavy crowd  the I.O.C. and Augusta National, the P.G.A., the R&A, the L.P.G.A., the U.S.G.A. and the I.G.F.  for delivery at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics after a seven-year gestation period.After a disappointing tie for 42nd at the Masters in his sixth start in an eight-week stretch, Scott took stock of his schedule. If he participated at the Rio Games in golfs modern-era Olympic debut, Scott would have spent seven days with his family in the nine weeks between the United States Open, which starts June 16, and the end of the mens Olympic competition in mid-August. In that span, he would be competing in three majors and a World Golf Championships event.With too many important tournaments and not enough time with his daughter, Bo Vera, at an important stage in her development, the math did not add up for Scott, who bowed out of the Olympics. Ranked seventh in the world, Scott, the first Australian to have won the Masters, is the most conspicuous golfer in his sports budding Olympic Medals Dont Matter movement.The tough part was to choose not to represent Australia, Scott said Wednesday, adding, But I feel like I do that every week.Scotts decision opened him to criticism in his homeland, where the Olympics are highly valued, and in the tight-knit circle of athletes for whom an Olympic gold medal is the most treasured currency.Michael Phelps, the most successful Olympian in history with 22 medals, including 18 golds, said last week, I think it stinks not having Adam in there, somebody who has been such a big part of the game over the last few years.Phelps, 30, mentioned Jordan Spieth, a 22-year-old American who has enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to compete.You see some of these golfers who are so excited to have a chance to be back in the Olympics, Phelps said. You could probably argue that some of these guys probably think the Masters, the rest of the majors, are bigger than what the Olympics is. In reality, the Olympics is the largest level in athletics in the world. Theres no higher level of competition.The scheduling nightmare that Scott and the worlds other top golfers are expected to sleepwalk through so that the sport may field its Dream Team in Rio comes into sharp relief when you consider this: Between the United States swimming trials, where Phelps is expected to qualify for his fifth Olympic team, and his next competitive start, in Rio, the golfers will contest two majors (the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship) and a World Golf Championships event.If the power brokers in golf had taken care to carve out room in the schedule for the Olympics instead of shoehorning them into the calendar, it definitely could have changed Scotts decision, he said. But in their courtship of the I.O.C., the top golf officials were like the ardent suitor who gives little consideration to the future beyond the presentation of the attention-grabbing engagement ring.Rory McIlroy, who will defend his title this week at the Wells Fargo Championship, will represent Ireland in Rio. McIlroy, the third-ranked golfer in the world, said, I feel like the officials were patting themselves on the back for getting golf in, instead of treating the sports inclusion in the Olympics as the first step in a marathon of planning.Golfs ruling bodies had seven years to smooth over the ruffled feathers of sponsors or tournament officials whose events could have been sacrificed this year for the greater good of the game. They also could have fought for a mixed-gender event, which Scott said would have been a great platform, or a team format at the Olympics. Instead they took the path of least resistance, a stroke-play event that guaranteed a maximum star presence and a minimum overall impact.The powers-that-be whiffed. And because they would not make the tough calls, the players are left to wrestle with the difficult decision on whether to opt out of the Olympics.The recent withdrawals of players like Scott, the South Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel and the Fijian Vijay Singh, who have won a combined six major titles, will surely be followed by others before the Olympic rosters for the 60-player mens and womens fields are made final on July 11.Peter Dawson, the president of the International Golf Federation, called the withdrawals regrettable, as if he were an innocent bystander and not an architect of the design flaw that is causing so many high-profile recalls.Three top-25 players bypassing the Olympics gives golf a black eye. The players have yet to be subjected to the World Anti-Doping Agencys drug-testing program, which includes unannounced out-of-competition retrieval of blood and urine samples. They officially enter the testing pool on Friday. Given that one player in the world top 20 said his understanding was that random testing came with 24-hour advance notice, more fireworks may ensue.McIlroys concern is that golf will be banished from the Olympic family after the 2020 Games.Im not sure if were going to have another opportunity to win a gold medal after that, he said, adding: Its off to a rocky start. If we dont do something to change the narrative and get people excited about it, Im worried what will happen.Maybe most golfers do not covet an Olympic gold medal the way they do a Masters green jacket or the British Opens claret jug. But in time their attitudes could change. McIlroy, a four-time major champion, said he was willing to get his vaccinations for potential diseases; leave his fiance, Erica Stoll, at home as a precaution against the Zika virus; and give the Olympics a whirl.Go play four rounds really competitively and try and win a gold medal, McIlroy said. And if you do, I dont know how that will stack up against the other things that Ive done in my career now, but maybe I might look back in 20 years time, and a gold medal might be one of my crowning achievements in the game."}
{"text": "It is as iconic an image from the criminal underworld as the Tommy gun or the getaway car, a grim last act for the unfortunate soul whose life is about to end in a new pair of footwear.Cement shoes.One would be hard-pressed to think of a worse way to die than being fitted, as the saying goes, for cement shoes  fate hardening with every passing minute until the time comes to be dumped, feet first, into a watery grave, never to be seen again.Never again  that is the whole point, and it is exactly why cement shoes are the unicorn of true crime. Everyone can describe them, but who has seen them?Before Monday, precious few. Which makes the  discovery that morning in Brooklyn of a cement-shoed corpse all the more remarkable.The body of Peter Martinez, 28, better known on the streets as Petey Crack, had washed up near Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn. At one end, his head was wrapped in duct tape. At the other, where his feet should be, was a five-gallon bucket filled with rock-hard concrete  a mix of cement, sand, gravel and water  encasing his legs up to the shins.The police said Mr. Martinez had a long history of arrests. He had been reported missing in February by his girlfriend. It seems that strong currents dragged Mr. Martinez, despite the homemade anchor, to shore, where he was discovered by a college student. There were no arrests in the case as of Wednesday, and the results of an autopsy were not yet complete.How long his body had been in the water was just one of the mysteries the police were sorting through; Mr. Martinezs last outfit  gray sweatpants, blue boxer shorts and a black jacket  was intact, and his tattoo of the Virgin Mary holding a rose was still visible.Crime historians were mystified, struggling to think of similar cases.No, said Thomas Reppetto, an author of books about organized crime. Not right offhand.Mike Dash, a crime writer in London who has written about Mafia killings, said: Ive definitely never heard of this happening before. Its just one of those stories that goes around. I think youve got a first there, by the sounds of things.There are countless accounts of those shoes over the years. They are there in the opening pages of E. L. Doctorows 1989 novel, Billy Bathgate, in which a character, barefoot, delicately, gingerly, placed one foot at a time in the laundry tub in front of him that was filled with wet cement.The scene resembles a killing rumored to have happened in the 1930s, but the real body was never found. Countless similar examples exist  cement shoes believed to be worn by men never seen again, and therefore, by definition, themselves never seen. And yet the shoes fit snugly on the imagination.At the 1987 trial of John Gotti, a prospective juror was dismissed after relating what a boyfriend had once told her: If you do anything wrong, Ill get the Mafia after you. Youll be wearing cement shoes.Making a pair of cement shoes sounds easy enough. A bag of concrete mix, some water and a large bucket would seem to be all one needs for the job.But there is one more important ingredient: time. An amount of uninterrupted time not commonly associated with murderers looking to cover their tracks.How long would cement shoes take to harden? Paul Bartelotti, owner of M&B Concrete in Brooklyn, tried to imagine the process.They could have gotten just a bag and added water, he said. Not too much  the consistency has to be just right. Like Carvel ice cream. Not, like, paint-thick. A little thicker.For several hours, the captive could still pull his feet out. It would take at least, I would say, the better part of the day to not get your feet out, Mr. Bartelotti said. Depends on the temperature.Concrete hardens quickly in warm temperatures, he said. Mr. Martinez disappeared in February.It was cold, Mr. Bartelotti mused. If you let it sit from 12 hours to a day, the guy wouldnt be able to get his feet out. He considered the situations. They could make it wet and make the guy stand in it, or put his legs in and pour the cement around it. He could have been dead and they just stuck his feet in.Mr. Martinez had survived brushes with death before. He was shot in the leg in 2008. The scar was there on the body that was found on Monday, high enough on the leg to be above the concrete. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are as murky as everything else.The discovery of his remains, the actual sighting of a thing of legend, may be the moment for which Mr. Martinez will be forever known."}
{"text": "Red carpet hair can be tiresome. Even Monday at the Met Gala, which is known for bolder fashions and hairstyles than Hollywood awards shows, you could have bet your blow dryer there would be an ingnue with effortless beach waves or a more serious actress going for the shock of an impenetrably sleek blowout.That the menu has become as predictable as the one at your local Drybar is disheartening. These are women, after all, who make their money on their image (and, yes, sometimes their talent).That is, unless youre a client of Adir Abergel.Mr. Abergel, a stylist based in Los Angeles, has been steadily leading his roster of actresses down more challenging paths. The simple yet stunning gold-twined braids Saoirse Ronan wore to the Golden Globes in January? Mr. Abergels innovative way of eschewing hair accessories.Its about being creative, he said, admonishing those who reach too quickly for a barrette.Kristen Stewarts post-Twilight oily strands? The stylists personal mission to bring back grunge and break that mold of classic Hollywood hairdos, he said.Or how about the parade of Rooney Mara updos that have ranged from geisha robot to neo-warrior? The result is a mutual collaboration Mr. Abergel is grateful for.Rooney likes to wear her hair back  most women dont, he said. You really start to think about form and texture and shape in a different way. She really pushes me.A few days before he styled Ms. Stewarts hair for the Met Gala (a punk-hacker chic coif with bleached white strands defined by a single cornrow), Mr. Abergel, 38, was dressed casually for a late breakfast at Gemma in the Bowery Hotel. His clothes were monochromatic, but he had accessorized with a silver and turquoise statement necklace and gold wire earrings that looped dizzyingly around his lobes like gilded bird nests.With his anything-goes personal style and ready laugh, it is easy to imagine him cajoling a client into letting her freak flag fly. Why not the leather-bound topknot?(Or as Ms. Stewart put it in a text message: Adir has a forward energy. It moves everyone around him.)But that is not his sole point, Mr. Abergel insists. Rather, as a hairstylist, he advocates individuality. Not all his of ladies are of the intrepid Ms. Mara variety.I have clients like Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Garner who are classic beauties, he said. Its not even that they wouldnt go there. It wouldnt fit who they are as a person.Mr. Abergel is also forthright. I know I am a talented hairdresser, he said, but he also knows that celebrity hairstyling requires additional skills, like being able to bring a difficult actress out of a high-and-mighty funk.For Ms. Garner, his longest-running celebrity client (they met when she was just an Alias baby, he said), he stands out because of what she calls his uncanny ability to walk into a room, read the energy, melt into it and then shift anything funky to fabulous.It helps that he has a nurturing personality. Its the Israeli-Moroccan in me, he said. I grew up with my family hosting a 20-person Shabbat dinner every Friday night.Mr. Abergel grew up in Jerusalem and Los Angeles, the son of a human-rights activist and a painter. He took an early interest in womens hair by experimenting on his mothers friends. He was sidetracked only temporarily in his early teens by the club scene in New York, where he lived from 13 to 16. (I wanted to be a dancer, he said.)When he returned to Los Angeles, he landed a plum job as an assistant to the stylist Arthur Johns. Only 16 at the time, he had marched into Mr. Johnss salon and brazenly declared him his mentor. He was doing everyone from Olivia Newton-John to Chaka Khan to Tina Turner, Mr. Abergel said.But it was not only Mr. Johns who taught him the foundation of hair. The starry clientele had plenty to say, too. Regulars like Edie Adams (an actress and singer in the 50s and 60s who died in 2008) would share the secrets behind their signature dos, which became a lasting influence.Hair is really about architecture, Mr. Abergel said, noting that red carpet hair needs to last through the carpet, premiere and after-party. That deceptively simple blowout on his client Gwyneth Paltrow? There are secret daubs of mousse at the roots to create lasting volume.By the time Mr. Abergel struck out on his own, he had already begun to build a reputation. At 26, he worked in London for a year, assisting European hair greats like Odile Gilbert and Julien dYs, and taking on clients like Sienna Miller and Maggie Q. It was in London that he began to realize that Los Angeles stylists lacked fresh inspiration, instead reaching for the same old images of Rita Hayworth and Veronica Lake.L.A. doesnt have street style, which affects the way you interact with your craft, he said, adding that when he travels, he takes time to sit and observe street fashion and hair trends.And despite our image-oriented age, he thinks that originality has been lost. If he searches Pinterest for, say, edgy, structural updos, the images are all homogenized, he said. The boards reference the same images over and over.Aside from the Met Gala, Mr. Abergel was in New York exploring opportunities for a hair-care line of his own  not just for the money, he said, but to take back some control over his time. (No surprise that celebrity hairstylists are often at the mercy of  well, celebrities.)I have my own life, he said, including a husband, who, as an immunologist, is actually doing things to save the world. He wants to start a family. Being pregnant would be my dream, he said. (The couple hope to adopt down the line.)In the meantime, Mr. Abergel has his ladies to tend to, many of whom have become friends, if not nearly family. Ms. Garner said, I have no secrets from him."}
{"text": "A federal jail guard was sentenced on Wednesday to seven years in prison after an inmate gave testimony about how he raped her inside a Manhattan jail.It wasnt consensual sex, the unidentified woman told the guard, Rudell Mullings, as she read from a statement in federal court in Brooklyn. It was rape.Mr. Mullings pleaded guilty last year to a charge of sexually abusing a prisoner, which carries a term of up to three years in prison under sentencing guidelines.The inmate, who was sentenced to 30 years for a homicide, told Judge Edward Korman of Federal District Court that Mr. Mullings had harassed her for several weeks before accosting her on Feb. 14, 2015, in a hallway where she was waxing the floor.On Wednesday, Mr. Mullingss lawyer asked for six months of jail time and six months of house arrest.But Judge Korman  after criticizing prosecutors for not making Mr. Mullings plead guilty to more serious charges  called the guidelines ludicrous, given the circumstances. A harsher sentence was needed, he said, to send a message that this conduct is totally unacceptable and deserves severe punishment."}
{"text": "The bodies of murdered young women began turning up one by one more than 30 years ago in South Los Angeles. The killer became known as the Grim Sleeper, so named because he apparently took a long break between victims. On Thursday, a jury convicted a small-time car thief, Lonnie D. Franklin Jr., of 10 murders, capping nearly three months of wrenching testimony and decades of uncertainty for the victims shattered families.Mr. Franklin was found guilty of 10 counts of first-degree murder, and one count of attempted murder because one of his victims escaped.Family members of the victims in the courtroom sobbed as the verdicts were read. Its just unimaginable how you feel once you get what youve been waiting to hear, said Porter Alexander, 75, whose daughter Alicia Alexander was killed in 1988. Im so glad.In the trial that began in February in Los Angeles Superior Court, prosecutors said Mr. Franklin had stalked a fairly circumscribed area of South Los Angeles from the mid-1980s until 2007, when the last known victim was found. Most had been shot with a .25-caliber pistol, and some had been strangled. DNA or ballistics evidence linked Mr. Franklin, 63, to each of the victims  nine women and one teenage girl  prosecutors said.Most of these victims have been dead for over 20 years, Beth Silverman, the deputy district attorney, said during closing arguments this week. Its time. Its time that justice was served in this case.Mr. Franklins lawyer, Seymour Amster, had tried to raise doubts about the reliability of the evidence, and during closing arguments, he proposed that an unnamed relative could have been the killer.A court clerk pronounced the word guilty over and over as she read the verdicts in the order that the victims died: Debra Jackson, 29; Henrietta Wright, 35; Barbara Ware, 23; Bernita Sparks, 25; Mary Lowe, 26; Lachrica Jefferson, 22; Alicia Alexander, 18; Princess Berthomieux, 15; Valerie McCorvey, 35; and Janecia Peters, 25.The penalty phase begins on Wednesday. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty.The effort to capture the killer, who appeared to stop in 1988 and begin again in 2002, had dragged on for so long because of a lack of witnesses and evidence, officials said. The number of murders that pervaded Los Angeles in 1980s, including the work of several other serial killers, also complicated the investigation.But some family members and victim advocates saw a more troubling factor: They suggested that the case had not spurred a sense of urgency in law enforcement or in the news media because of the victims involved: young African-American women living at the margins, many of them cocaine users and at times prostitutes.Margaret Prescod, an advocate for the families, contrasted this case with that of Natalee Holloway, the white Alabama teenager whose 2005 disappearance in Aruba caused a media sensation.These are 10 women here, she said. And you walk around the city of Los Angeles and ask people, most people have never even heard of it. Can you imagine that?The break in the case came after Mr. Franklins son, Christopher Franklin, was arrested in 2008 on a charge of carrying a weapon and had to provide a DNA sample. Investigators determined that he had a familial link to evidence from the cold case.The authorities said the fathers connection to the murders was confirmed after a detective posed as a pizzeria busboy and collected a partly eaten slice that he had left. At the time,  familial DNA to capture a murder suspect represented a first in American law enforcement. The technique is now used in at least 10 states.On July 7, 2010, the authorities announced the arrest of Lonnie Franklin, a former sanitation worker and Police Department garage attendant. He was captured in front of the lime green home he shared with his wife, just a few miles from the alleyways where the bodies had been found. The Grim Sleeper had been there, hiding in plain sight, the whole time, officials said.We never gave up on this investigation, not for one minute, Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement at the time.In a search of the elder Mr. Franklins home, the authorities found hundreds of photographs of women, many of them naked. Among them was a picture of Enietra Washington, who is believed to be the serial killers only survivor.Ms. Washington, 57, provided some of the trials most riveting testimony as she recounted the day she was attacked in 1988. She said Mr. Franklin pulled up next to her in an orange Ford Pinto as she was walking to a friends house and asked if he could give her a ride, pressing the offer repeatedly. After she got in, he shot her in the chest, Ms. Washington testified.You shot me? she recalled saying, according to The Los Angeles Times. I asked him, Why?She was dogging him out, or disrespecting him, she recalled him saying.Ms. Washington said he sexually assaulted her, took photographs of her and left her for dead on the street. In court, prosecutors presented the picture found in Mr. Franklins home, showing Ms. Washington bloodied and partly exposed.Mr. Franklin did not testify, but he has maintained his innocence. During the trial, the jury was shown a taped interrogation of Mr. Franklin. Los Angeles detectives placed photos of the victims on a table, asking him if he recognized them, one by one, according to  The Los Angeles Times.Each time, Mr. Franklin rejected any connection to the women. I havent killed anybody, he said.Since the case began lurching toward trial in 2010, investigators have linked him to at least six additional victims. They believe there could be others.In an unexpected twist on Wednesday, prosecutors disclosed that Mr. Franklin had been convicted of rape while serving in the Army in Germany, ABC7 reported. Ms. Silverman, the deputy district attorney, said he and two friends had driven to a village, dragged a woman to the vehicle and sexually assaulted her.Ms. Silverman said she would bring up the case during sentencing.Ms. Prescod, who founded a group Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders, said the conviction of Mr. Franklin might represent a bit of respite for the victims families.But for us its not over, she said on Thursday. She noted that 35 women appearing in the photographs found in Mr. Franklins home remained unaccounted for.Where are they? she asked. Where else could that happen and it not be an outrage?"}

The rookie Radek Faksa had the other goal for Dallas.Vladimir Tarasenko scored his sixth goal of the playoffs on a first-period breakaway and added an assist for St. Louis, giving him five points in the last two games. Paul Stastny also scored off a deflection from Tarasenko.Game 5 is set for Saturday in Dallas.Eakin has a goal and seven assists in the postseason. He beat Brian Elliott on a three-on-two break after the Blues pressured goalie Kari Lehtonen on the opposite end.The Stars are 1-2 in overtime in the playoffs, and the Blues are 2-2.Tarasenkos goal was an exception to the rule in a tight-checking first period. Somehow he found the defense napping and scored his 16th career goal in 24 playoff games, beating Lehtonen between the pads.The Stars looked worse on the play given that they had six men on the ice, an infraction that went undetected.Faksa, who had the deciding goal in the Stars Game 1 victory, tied it on an unassisted goal off a giveaway by another rookie, Joel Edmundson. Sharp had a tap-in for his first point of the series on a power play off an assist by Jamie Benn, giving the Stars two goals in 1:09 and the lead.Dallas had been 0 for 12 with the man advantage before Sharps fourth goal of the playoffs over all.Edmundson played sparingly the rest of the period, totaling 2:38 in four shifts.Stastnys first goal of the playoffs on a deflection from Tarasenko tied it on a four-on-three power play at 13:06 of the second.Tarasenko leads the Blues with 11 points in the postseason."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  In an extraordinary rebuke of his partys presumed nominee, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nations highest-ranking elected Republican, said Thursday that he was not ready to endorse Donald J. Trump for president.Mr. Ryans announcement represented a split among Republicans not seen in at least a half century, and it came only two days after Mr. Trump said he would unify the party after essentially clinching the nomination with his victory in the Indiana primary.As the chairman of the Republican National Convention, Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said he would support his partys nominee as Republicans tried to regain the White House and solidify control of Congress.But the combination of Mr. Trumps at times outrageous remarks  insulting women, Hispanics and Muslims  and his broad rejection of many core Republican policies proved too toxic a brew for Mr. Ryan as he defended his majority in the House, the reputation of his party and his own viability.Within an hour, Mr. Trump offered a biting rejoinder, saying in a statement that he was not ready to support Speaker Ryans agenda.Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people, he said. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!Mr. Ryan, who made his remarks in an interview with CNN, said Republicans want a standard-bearer that bears our standards.I think conservatives want to know: Does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution? he said. Theres a lot of questions that conservatives, I think, are going to want answers to.Mr. Ryans ambivalence toward Mr. Trump adds another layer of division in a party torn by the billionaire developers ascent, placing him at odds with his fellow Wisconsinite, Reince Priebus, the party chairman, who pronounced Mr. Trump the presumptive nominee and said Republicans should fall in line. Mr. Priebus was not aware Mr. Ryan was going to make the statement, his spokesman, Sean Spicer, told CNN.Although Mr. Ryan said he had expected the race to run at least a few more weeks, he had spent the last day honing his position, aides said, even as others, like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, voiced unequivocal if not effusive support for Mr. Trump. While Mr. Ryans defiance put him in line with a number of other prominent Republicans, Mr. Trump has defied convention throughout the campaign, so the long-term effect was at best uncertain.In a campaign that has delivered a daily dose of head-shaking moments of awe, Mr. Trump on Thursday continued the trend, in a manner that made some Republicans cringe. In honor of Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Trump posted  a photo on Twitter of himself digging into a taco bowl  made in the Trump Tower food court, of course  and included in the caption I love Hispanics.A party nominee has never failed to gain the support of a House speaker or majority leader from his party in modern times. In 1896, Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed ran against William McKinley and made it be known he would not serve as vice president, but ended up backing the nominee.In 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater had to wait a bit uncomfortably for the endorsement of Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, but Mr. Dirksen gave it and thus ended the stop-Goldwater movement.While Mr. Ryans remarks caught Republicans off guard, it also gave them essentially a permission slip to go their own way on Mr. Trumps candidacy. Had Mr. Ryan issued a forceful endorsement, it would have put pressure on fellow House Republicans to follow his lead, a step many have been unwilling to take.Im not there right now, Mr. Ryan said. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party, and I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.Mr. Trump, who once said Mr. Ryan would pay a big price if he did not support him, knows that the speaker and other opponents did not have great sway over primary voters. But Mr. Ryan, who has helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Republicans, may well be a more notable voice in a general election.Outside of Mr. Trumps remarks about Muslims, Hispanic immigrants, women and other groups  which Mr. Ryan has at times gone out of his way to denounce  his policy positions on many major issues, notably trade and entitlements, stand in stark contrast with Mr. Ryans.Mr. Ryan has been signaling a willingness to carve out some terrain to differentiate himself by insisting that House Republicans write their own policy agenda this year, and he has left bread crumbs of ambivalence for months by giving speeches that at times criticized Mr. Trumps views.After Mr. Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, Mr. Ryan strongly disagreed. This is not conservatism, Mr. Ryan said in December. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for, and more important, its not what this country stands for.He also criticized Mr. Trump for declining to distance himself from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games, Mr. Ryan told reporters in early March.This is fundamental, Mr. Ryan added at the time. And if someone wants to be our nominee, they must understand this. I hope this is the last time I need to speak out on this race.While saying Thursday that I dont want to underplay what Mr. Trump accomplished, Mr. Ryan picked up on those earlier themes, adding, We hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln and Reaganesque, someone who appeals to a wide, vast majority of Americans.Mr. Trump is expected to be a drag on some Republican candidates running for the House and Senate this November, given his intense unpopularity with key voting groups, including women, Hispanics and voters with college degrees.Even before Mr. Ryan spoke out, Mr. Trump was confronting the prospect of crippling defections within the Republican elite. Both George Bush and George W. Bush, the only two living former Republican presidents, announced on Wednesday that they would not back his candidacy.Mike Shields, president of the American Action Network, a conservative outside spending group, said Mr. Ryan had effectively cleared the way for others in the party to decide for themselves how to handle Mr. Trump. Mr. Shields said that with Mr. Ryan as an example, many candidates could cleave to a message and an issue agenda distinct from Mr. Trumps.This is something that every Republican can say at the local level, Mr. Shields said. Its great leadership on Paul Ryans part, because it puts them in a place where all these other members can turn around and say the same thing, which is, Look, there are some things that weve got to stand for. In exit polls, big chunks of the Republican electorate said they remained deeply wary of Mr. Trump. In Indiana, the state where he effectively locked up the Republican nomination, about a quarter of Republican voters said they would be scared to see him as the president.Mr. Ryan alluded Thursday to the broad stakes for his party. I just think you always run like everything is on the line. My focus this fall is, has been and will be the House majority, Mr. Ryan said. He added, But I also really love this country, and I want to see us win this election."}
{"text": "Seven years ago, Chris King, known around hockey rinks as Kinger, was cut loose from the Islanders radio team because, well, it had actually ceased to exist. To save costs, the team opted to simulcast MSG television broadcasts on two Long Island radio stations.It was a disaster  just a terrible decision  and everybody realized it immediately, King said recently.So, a year later, King was brought back to a new spot on the radio dial, but with an unusual new partner  or, to be more accurate, partners. Games were to be presented on WRHU-FM, the Hofstra University station, and the broadcasts would largely be produced by Hofstra students.King, 54, is unfailingly enthusiastic, but he knew that a lot of long-suffering fans were snickering. To involve a college radio station in a professional hockey teams broadcasts seemed, to many Islanders fans, to be not only cheap, but also bush league. King pushed on.Islanders games can still be heard on WRHU. But with the team in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, facing the Tampa Bay Lightning, the broadcasts are also simulcast on WFAN (when the Yankees are not playing at the same time) or WCBS  two king-size New York radio stations.King has become a mentor as well as a play-by-play man, and he now says of working with students: Its one of the best parts of my job. I never saw that coming, because most professionals dont have to do that.The unusual Hofstra-Islanders double team has worked, but the Islanders recent success could jeopardize the arrangement.We created the Islanders Radio Network in order to hit the New York and Long Island market, and Hofstra is our Long Island station, Barry Baum, the chief communications officer for Brooklyn Sports and Entertainment, which operates the Islanders arena, Barclays Center, said in a statement. Its a one-year deal, and theres been a lot of interest from 50,000-watt stations in New York for next season. Our plan is to explore all options, with the focus on providing the widest possible distribution for Islanders fans.Nevertheless, Radio Hofstra University, with help from professionals like King and John Mullen, a 39-year-old producer, has helped the Islanders find a loving home. Dozens of students have also gained hands-on experience in the last six years.This is the first season that color commentary for King on the broadcasts has not been provided by a rotating team of students; Greg Picker, formerly of the Islanders communications department, is now the analyst.But many students have benefited, among them Mark Weiner, a senior journalism major from the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, who will graduate this month. Weiner has done a little of everything: producing in the studio, analyzing games and reporting from games and practices.Its everything Ive ever dreamed about, said Weiner, who has also done broadcasts of Hofstra sports events. Kinger has probably been the best mentor Ive ever had. He doesnt treat us like college students  he treats us like professionals. Hes a mentor for everybody. There are a lot of pro broadcasters who wouldnt have done that.There is virtually no difference between the broadcasts in the regular season on WRHU (also carried on WRCN-FM in Suffolk County and WNYE-FM in New York) and those in the playoffs on WFAN and WCBS. King, though, has found a new audience.His joyous call of John Tavaress game-winning and series-winning goal in the second overtime of Game 6 against the Florida Panthers in the first round of the playoffs, punctuated with a Yes, yes, yes! was played to television and Internet audiences in the United States and Canada. The playoff series win was the Islanders first since 1993.You can kind of call me the jinx because 1994 was my first year on the Islander broadcasts, said King, a former software engineer who became a disc jockey before joining the Islanders as a host of pregame, intermission and postgame broadcasts.King, a Long Island native, and Mullen essentially design the broadcasts, and, Mullen said, RHU uses the same model that a regular major network would use.Students collaborate at the studio and on-site, mixing sound, operating the board, producing commercials, cutting highlights and gathering interviews with players that can be broadcast before, during and after games or turned into features.Mullen said: The people we have, instead of 25, theyre 18, 19, 20, 21. The things that the students have displayed are maturity, professionalism and dedication. Becoming a member of the broadcast team has become competitive among students.He added: Once people hear the broadcast, we get positive feedback. If they didnt know anything about it, theyd think it was a standard, deep network product.Hofstra students did not join King and Picker in Tampa, Fla., for Games 1 and 2 of the series against the Lightning, but they and Mullen were in the studio, pitching in as they prepared for final exams.Of his changing cast of teammates for six seasons, King said, They do have classes  I forget that, too, at some point.He added: I love seeing the students progress. Theyre raw, but theyre talented. Its fun to see what they can do."}
{"text": "PALMYRA, Syria  Russia has made its mark on Syria with the crash of bombs and the thud of artillery. On Thursday the Russians added gentler sounds: live classical music echoing through an ancient stone theater and into the eerie, empty desert.Extending its soft power into the Syrian conflict, Russia deployed a symphony orchestra led by one of its best-known conductors, Valery Gergiev, and the cellist Sergei P. Roldugin, an old and  according to the Panama Papers documents leaked last month  very wealthy friend of President Vladimir V. Putin.Their performance space was Palmyra, the city of ruins left by Roman and other ancient civilizations and ruined further by the depredations of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.The orchestra played pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach and two Russian composers, Sergei Prokofiev and Rodion Shchedrin, in a second-century Roman amphitheater, the set for a 2015 film produced by the Islamic State that featured the execution of 25 people.The contrast was intended to underscore what Russia sees as its underappreciated role in helping Syrian forces liberate Palmyra from zealots and fighting on the side of civilization against barbarism.The Russians were so eager to make that point that they flew a group of reporters from Moscow to Syria and then bused them to Palmyra to see the performance. The production, attended by a heavily guarded V.I.P. guest list, was broadcast live on Russian state television.Viewers in Russia saw the concert spliced with videos of Islamic State atrocities, part of a domestic political operation intended to mobilize pride in Russias military role abroad, at a time when the economy at home is mired in the second year of a deep recession.Mr. Putin thanked the musicians by video link from his vacation home on the Black Sea.He said the performance signaled hope for Palmyras revival as the heritage of the whole humanity, but also as hope that our contemporary civilization will be relieved from this horrible disease, international terrorism.The deployment of classical musicians in territory reconquered, with Russian help, by Syrian forces just two months ago reprised a performance conducted by Mr. Gergiev in August 2008 to celebrate Russias victory in a brief war with the former Soviet republic of Georgia over South Ossetia. That Georgian region, also with Moscows help, has declared itself an independent state, like the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.Mr. Gergiev, the artistic and general director of the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra in St. Petersburg, music director of the Munich Symphony Orchestra and previously the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, has long been an eager supporter of Russias direction under President Putin. He joined other prominent cultural figures in signing an open letter in 2014 in support of Russias annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.Also taking part in the Palmyra spectacle, before an audience of Russian and Syrian soldiers, officials and dignitaries, was Mr. Putins friend Mr. Roldugin, the cellist whose name surfaced last month in leaked papers from a Panama law firm that indicated he had $2 billion in offshore accounts.Wearing a white cap and accompanied by the orchestra, he played Quadrille from Not Only Love, an opera by Shchedrin.Mr. Putin has dismissed the so-called Panama Papers disclosures as a plot to weaken us from within and said Mr. Roldugin had used the money attributed to offshore companies he controlled to import musical instruments.The dignitaries attending the concert included several foreign ambassadors to Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency based in Paris, which has declared Palmyra a World Heritage Site.Darko Tanaskovic, the ambassador from Serbia, said the gathering was a way for international society to give Syrians hope.We have to solve the problems of migrants in Europe, but we have to give them hope to live here as well, he said.Shortly before the concert, the desert silence was broken by a thud from a Russian demining center near the ruins.Russia has a history of turning to classical music for morale in conflict, using talented artists to display its cultural strengths. It did in August 1942 when, during the Nazi siege of Leningrad, as St. Petersburg was then called, starving Russian musicians, supplemented by military performers, gave the citys first performance of Dmitri Shostakovichs Symphony No. 7, otherwise known as the Leningrad Symphony.The concert on Thursday, like Mr. Gergievs 2008 concert in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, involved much more than just music. While showcasing Russias musical richness, it was also a military mission, with guests bused in a heavily guarded convoy escorted by helicopter gunships. The route from Latakia, the site of Russias main military base on Syrias Mediterranean coast, led past Syrian military outposts, destroyed villages, clusters of burned vehicles and other reminders of the fierce fighting that had raged in an area held by the Islamic State from May 2015 until March this year.The concert, performed by Mr. Gergievs Mariinsky Theater Orchestra, was held just a week after Unesco experts had visited to assess the destruction inflicted by the militant group. They reported extensive damage to the citys museum, where statues had been defaced, smashed, their heads severed, the fragments left lying on the ground. Also destroyed was an arch and the Temple of Baal Shamin, which the experts said had been smashed to smithereens.Western governments have been reluctant to endorse Russias military role in Syria, which they have repeatedly portrayed as an effort to not merely uproot terrorism but to help Syrias president, Bashar al-Assad, crush all opposition, including rebel groups supported by the West. Russia has also been accused of bombing hospitals, something Moscow denies, and propping up a brutal dictator.Russias military first became directly involved in the Syrian conflict last September. Declaring the mission mostly accomplished, Mr. Putin in March ordered the withdrawal of the main part of Russian forces.Yet at Russias base in Latakia this week there was no sign of any pullout at an airfield clogged with warplanes and helicopters. Su-24 fighter-bombers were taking off and landing regularly.A library established in a shipping container offered a growing collection of Russian-language novels and other books. Sgt. Alexander Korenyev, the librarian, said it had 1,476 titles when he arrived three months ago and about 2,000 today. Many have military themes, like a tome titled The Winged Heroes of Moscow.The officers like history, the soldiers science fiction and the women in the canteen  well, you understand  like romances, the librarian said.The Russian military has also opened a rest center  called a psychological unloading in Russian  in a base tent. Oil paintings of a birch forest and a snowy landscape adorn the tent walls to help soldiers forget Syria.As part of a push to persuade skeptics of its intervention, Russia has deployed teams of officers to promote reconciliation between the Syrian government and its opponents.The Russians, like the American military in Iraq after the 2003 invasion, are diving into tangled local politics.A day before the concert, the Russian military took reporters to Kaukab, a village east of Latakia, where local chiefs held what was described as a reconciliation ceremony with the Syrian government. The village, on a hill overlooking orchards and badly damaged by recent fighting, looked deserted at first, but when the buses carrying reporters arrived, a crowd of children appeared waving portraits of Mr. Assad.The Russians said they had carried out 92 such ceremonies involving 52 armed groups.As shadows lengthened in Palmyra after Thursdays concert and dusk cooled the heat of the day, Mr. Roldugin, the cello maestro, said he had left his Stradivarius home.I wouldnt bring such a cello to this climate, with the heat and the dust, Mr. Roldugin said, portraying himself as a musician of modest means that seemingly belied his vast  at least on paper  offshore wealth. Its a rare instrument, he said. It costs a lot."}
{"text": "PARK RIDGE, N.J.  The walls in Kendra and Allan Daniels townhouse are crowded  very crowded. There are folk-art paintings. There is an original drawing from Winnie-the-Pooh. There is a watercolor by Humphrey Bogarts mother.Even the bathrooms are something to see. A first-floor one is filled with framed originals by an illustrator for children, Nura Woodson Ulreich. One on the second floor has a watercolor by Yves St. Laurent.If there is such a thing as collectionitis, the Daniels have it. They have already reduced their holdings with what amounted to his-and-her sales  his at Christies in 2001, hers at Sothebys in 2011  and with steady gifts to museums. Still the four levels of their townhouse are overflowing with objects. Twenty-six hundred square feet can hold only so many 19th-century weather vanes, old carousel giraffes and camels and display drawers with St. Laurent necklaces.Its like living in a submarine, Mr. Daniel said. Very tight.And it is going to get tighter.After the exhibition Mystery and Benevolence closes at the American Folk Art Museum in Manhattan on Sunday, 10 or so items will be sent back to the Daniels, who donated to the museum the 190 other objects that were part of the show  signs, plaques, banners, clock faces, carved picture frames, even a wooden grave marker.This presents a challenge for Ms. Daniel, who does the arranging in the townhouse: where to put the items that have served as place holders? Because, months ago, when those things were taken down and sent to the museum in time for the January opening of Mystery and Benevolence, she filled the vacancies.Mr. Daniel said he did not know how many objects they live with. Ive never done an inventory, he said.Whatever the count, it was enough to send a visitor, still on the first floor, into sensory overload. Anne-Imelda Radice, the executive director of the folk art museum, said she was just blown away the first time she visited the Daniels home.You dont often see so many beautiful things in one place at one time, she said. Yes, its their home, and its a nice, warm place, but you have a sense that the art rules. Its shown in a way that you really see each piece. Thats the kind of exhibiting that you see in a museum.The Daniels were art dealers when they met and married in the 1990s. He had concentrated on folk art, she on illustrations for children. Mr. Daniel, 82, said he stopped working as a dealer after he joined the board of the American Folk Art Museum in 2008.They have vintage womens shoe heels in a narrow cabinet on the second floor and dog figurines on shelves in the kitchen, a few feet from a weather vane of the angel Gabriel, made in 1840 for a church in Massachusetts. It was depicted on a postage stamp in 1965 and, more recently, shown at the National Gallery of Art.It is just steps from what Ms. Daniel described as the Mona Lisa of their collection: Portrait of a Young Girl and Her Cat, by the artist Ammi Phillips, who crisscrossed New York and New England for decades before his death at age 77 in 1865.We bought it because its beautiful, because we really love it, Mr. Daniel said. It was kind of out of our price range, but sometimes you have to really step out to get something that is so dramatically beautiful. Thats the good part. The bad part is, it makes everything else pale by comparison.Ms. Daniel spoke up: I dont think it does.They acquired the canvas at an auction at Christies in 2007. The trade publication Antiques and the Arts Weekly reported that they paid $1.24 million for it.And then they faced a familiar problem. As soon as he bought it, she said, I ran in here and started clearing things.The folk art museum has its own Phillips of a girl in a red dress with a cat  a different girl with a different cat (and a dog, as a bonus). Ms. Hollander, the curator, said Phillips painted maybe four or five children in red dresses going back to 1830, when the one in the museum was painted.The one belonging to the Daniels came later, about 1835, according to Ms. Hollander, who says theirs is more sensual, and the colors more lush. Ammi Phillips, as an artist, changed with the times, she said. He had the ability to give his customers what they wanted, what was up-to-date, what was fashionable.Ms. Daniel was an artist, she said, before she began collecting American paintings, though from a period somewhat later than those Mr. Daniel favored. Before she came along, he had displayed works the way Andy Warhol had. You know, where you put it on the floor against the wall, Ms. Daniel said. Warhol did an exhibition where things were where he left them. Allan was the same way.She is not. She arranges the objects in the townhouse in a way that is organized and precise rather than cluttered and busy.To return the Odd Fellows serpent staff that the museum borrowed to its place, Ms. Daniel will take down a cane that carries the faces and names of the commanders in chief from George Washington to Grover Cleveland. It was probably carved during Clevelands first term, because Benjamin Harrison, whose presidency came and went between Clevelands two terms, is nowhere to be seen.An Independent Order of Odd Fellows harp is also going back to its spot. Its place holder has been a barber pole. Ms. Daniel will find somewhere else to put that.Ive been saying we need a bigger house, Mr. Daniel said. Kendras been saying we need less stuff."}
{"text": "Everythings in service of the images in Bridgend, a stylishly shot, eerily scored and moodily acted film that wants for nothing but a plot. Depending on how you like your movies, this is either a walkout or a must-see.No matter which side you fall on for this fictional film, its based on a morbidly intriguing real-life tale. In the county of Bridgend, Wales, dozens of young people have killed themselves over the last decade, many by hanging. There have been theories about the deaths, but few solutions to end this so-called suicide cluster, which seems to be continuing.In this film, Sara (Hannah Murray) and her father, Dave (Steven Waddington), arrive in a village to relocate for Daves new assignment as a police officer. Sara soon falls in with a group of mysterious youths who seem connected to a spate of recent deaths.By and large, thats it. We watch Sara party with her friends, walk with them in the woods and mourn some of those who have taken their own lives. Magnus Nordenhof Jonck, the cinematographer, creates an unnerving atmosphere despite the static story and pretentious, repetitive shots of skies and of people blurred through windows.The director, Jeppe Ronde, fixes on the signals and silences these young people use to communicate. His attention to subtext is beguiling, and exasperating as you seek a little clarity. Some viewers will say that such confusion is what suicide feels like to those left behind. Others will long for a stronger attempt at understanding.If, like me, you fall in that second group, you can still see the ideas behind Mr. Rondes approach, and appreciate Ms. Murrays and Mr. Waddingtons bleak and immersive performances. So maybe theres a middle ground  admiring what you see, while wanting something more."}

Its sleekness betrays no hint of the gentrifying neighborhoods tatty, crime-ridden past or the creative experiments that have gone on there since 1980, when PS122 opened at the corner of East Ninth Street.What began as a squat in an old public school building would become a stage for people like Spalding Gray and Meredith Monk, for Eric Bogosian and the preglobal Blue Man Group.We had sort of a charmed life growing up there, said Mark Russell, the organizations artistic director from 1985 to 2005.That past, and the larger history of performance in the East Village, will be available, beginning on Saturday and continuing for the rest of the month, through a free self-guided, smartphone-enabled mobile tour that starts at PS122 and heads east to Tompkins Square Park before wending down Avenue A to the Pyramid Club, then over to Howl!

A kickoff event on Saturday at 2 p.m. will include a semi-guided tour, with a few iPads available for those without smartphones.A short video is paired with each location on the walk. At Howl!, its a homage to the performance artist Tom Murrin and his full-moon shows. At PS122, its about the time in November 1988 that the artist David Leslie, dressed  la Julie Andrews as Maria von Trapp, scaled the building for a piece called Stunt and plummeted five stories  which was part of the plan. In a clip of the performance, the crowd below reacts in horror. But Mr. Leslie survived; in the video, hes the one telling much of the tale.The tour, presented in conjunction with Lower East Side History Month, is a bit of a public-relations exercise for PS122, whose building has been closed for renovations since 2013. It has continued to present programming elsewhere in the meantime, but its staff members have been working out of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, since late 2011.Vallejo Gantner, PS122s artistic director, worries that young artists dont know that the organization is part of the East Village, and neither will some of its neighbors when it reopens, which it expects to do next year. He doesnt want it to seem, he said, as if we parachuted in.The challenge is to talk about the artistic exploration that has happened there, but in a way that is not just about nostalgia. He would like to see PS122 remain the hub of an innovative, generative culture, even if East Village rents mean fewer of its artists live around the corner.That ethos doesnt have to die just because the neighborhoods changed, he said. Because thats the thing that made it interesting, and will make it interesting in the future.Interesting, of course, is not always fun. Mr. Russell, now director of the Under the Radar Festival, remembers some of the downsides of making art in a neighborhood he said was a pioneer area.It was pretty beat, pretty dangerous, he said. We would get robbed, usually just after our benefits. That was really sad.For security, if not fire safety, he installed a roll-down, corrugated steel gate in the middle of a hallway.But PS122 flourished amid the boom of the 1980s and soon developed an international reputation. It became a magnet for experimental artists including Richard Maxwell, Young Jean Lee and Karen Finley. Participants in a four-day benefit before the center closed for renovations included Philip Glass, Elevator Repair Service, the Wooster Group and some neighbors from the building, Mabou Mines.Mr. Gantner said that he intended this months mobile tour to be the first part of a video project that would grow over time, celebrating the presence of boundary-pushing art in a neighborhood that, he said, does not need another hidden cocktail bar.If we wanted to live in a rich kind of financial hub, we could live in Frankfurt, Mr. Gantner, who is Australian, said. We could live in Singapore and be bored out of our skulls. We live in New York because its an exciting, dynamic, creative scene where were surrounded by interesting people.Thats been true of the East Village, Mr. Russell said, for longer than many might think. W. H. Auden lived on St. Marks Place, some of the Beat-era writers and painters migrated from the West Village, and Ellen Stewart started La MaMa in a basement on East Ninth Street, a half-block from where PS122 is now.Its good to know that, Mr. Russell said, when you walk down the street."}
{"text": "American workers are reaping fewer of the gains of a growing economy in the form of pay and benefits. Shareholders are reaping more in the form of corporate profits. That shift has been one of the most important economic stories of the last several decades, and it is the key to understanding stagnant wages for middle-class workers and a soaring stock market in the last quarter-century.Here is what is less widely understood: That trend appears to be reversing itself.It is early and the reversal may not last. And it certainly hasnt fully undone the shift underway since the 1980s. But the numbers are quite clear that in the last couple of years workers have claimed a bigger piece of the economic pie and shareholders a smaller one.The evidence available so far in 2016  steady growth in wages and weak earnings for publicly traded companies  suggests that the reversal is continuing this year.At the start of 2013, for example, 61 percent of national income went to pay and benefits for workers. But by the end of 2015, that had risen to 62.6 percent. (That said, in the early 1990s, that figure was around 66 percent.)If the proportion of national income going to workers in early 2013 had stayed constant, there would now be $251 billion a year less flowing into Americans paychecks than is the case. That is about $1,900 a year per household.At the same time, corporate profits share of national income has fallen, from 14.2 percent in the middle of 2014 to 12.1 percent by the end of 2015. That translates to $328 billion less in annual corporate profits than there would be if the earlier proportion had held.You can pick different numerators and denominators to get at the same concept  using just wages and salaries instead of total compensation, for example, or dividing by gross domestic product instead of the related concept of national income  but the same basic pattern reveals itself.And there is plenty of other anecdotal information and data consistent with the shift. Among the companies in the Standard & Poors 500, first-quarter earnings are on track to be 7.6 percent lower than a year earlier. Weak earnings growth, and lately an outright contraction in corporate profits, are a culprit in a stock market that has largely moved sideways for more than two years.A big part of the story is a steep decline in the profitability of the energy sector, reflecting a much lower price of oil and natural gas. Total corporate profits were $64 billion lower in 2015 than in 2014. A fall in the profitability of the petroleum and coal products sector accounted for $40 billion of that.There may be something broader going on that is holding back corporate profits beyond simply cheap oil. You might expect that the hit to profits in the energy sector caused by cheaper fuel would be counterbalanced by higher profits in sectors that use fuel, like airlines and trucking firms.That is where the other side of the equation  higher worker compensation  comes into play. Part of the reason corporate profits are falling appears to be that companies are having to pay their employees more.Hiring has been quite strong over three years, with millions of Americans getting jobs. That has pushed the unemployment rate steadily downward, to about 5 percent. Very gradually, a labor market that was very much tilted in favor of employers is tilting the other way.That means companies are having to work harder to attract good employees. They do that by paying higher wages and salaries (up 10 percent in 2015 compared with 2013) and more generous benefits package (up 6 percent over the two-year period).It is worth noting that this doesnt necessarily mean that pay is rising by that much for the typical worker. After all, the pay for chief executives and other highly paid people counts in those compensation numbers.Still, paired with other evidence, it doesnt look as if this is solely a phenomenon of the highest-paid workers making more. For example, average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial private sector workers rose 2.56 percent in 2015 in a year of very low inflation. That number was only 1.69 percent in 2012, when inflation was higher.It is hard to say definitively what has driven these trends, but heres a try:The shift of national income toward shareholders and away from workers since the 1980s was driven in part by a decline in union power and a rise in shareholder-driven capitalism that made managers more ruthless than their predecessors in seeking to minimize salary expense. (That includes refusing to give raises and laying off employees.)That long-term trend, along with a cyclical downturn during the 2008 recession and its aftermath, left workers with very little bargaining power and shareholders with the upper hand.In the last two or three years, as the economy has firmed up, workers have regained some of that bargaining power they lost in the recession. But they have not, at this point at least, gained the power they lost over the last three decades.In the meantime, workers celebrate getting a little bit bigger piece of the economic pie, and shareholders bemoan their smaller piece.It would be better if the pie were bigger to begin with. If overall national income were rising rapidly (it decidedly isnt), there would be room for both workers and shareholders to be fat and happy. One of the great questions for the economic future is what it would take to make that happen."}
{"text": "For foreign-born students desperate to stay in the United States, the University of Northern New Jersey seemed like the perfect solution: They did not have to go to class, but they could get coveted student visas and still work at their dream jobs.They just needed to pay a broker anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. Over the last three and a half years, more than a thousand agreed.That was their mistake.On April 5, the government revealed that the university was a fake  part of an elaborate  sting operation that resulted in the arrest of 22 brokers who arranged for students to enroll. These brokers belonged to an underground network of recruiters operating throughout the country who acted as middlemen between students and fraudulent schools known as visa mills, the government said.Twenty-five students were listed as anonymous co-conspirators, but officials say all of them knew they were committing fraud by not going to class. Within days, 1,076 of them were ordered to appear in immigration court, facing deportation or even a lifetime ban from the United States.They were 100 percent fully aware, said Alvin Phillips, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. All purported students are recorded at some point or another fully going along with the pay-to-stay scheme.There are both audio and video recordings from the presidents office in New Jersey, when students called or visited, Mr. Phillips said. He personally witnessed some of these exchanges, and heard students admit they knew the university would not have classes.But in interviews, more than a dozen students insisted that they were collateral damage in the sting operation, duped by both the brokers and the government.In some cases, their efforts to verify the university or even transfer were rebuffed by the brokers, they say. In other instances, the students point to what they say was active deception by the government: in-person meetings with the universitys supposed president, letters confirming they could work instead of go to class, and Twitter messages about classes canceled because of bad weather.In October, A., a young man from Shanghai living in New York City, was so frustrated when the university had not sent a needed eligibility form that he rented a car and drove to the campus. (A., like most of the students, insisted on being identified only by an initial because their immigration cases were still pending or their families back home did not know their situation.)At the universitys office in a nondescript building off the Garden State Parkway in Cranford, a man presenting himself as the institutions president, Steve Brunetti, signed the form. He told A. how proud he was of all his students and gave him a souvenir.It was a slick T-shirt with the letters UNNJ on the front. On the left sleeve was an American flag.A. said he did not think the experience was odd. I just figured that was the way it was done, he said.Winona Sun, an art therapist in Brooklyn, learned of the sting operation while she was in China visiting her parents, when her visa to re-enter the United States was revoked. I feel its over-punishment, she said in a telephone interview from China. If the target is for the brokers, why do they want to tear people down and lie to me?The federal government accredits 8,687 educational institutions in the United States to enroll international students; 1.18 million are currently studying here. The students enrolled at the University of Northern New Jersey had all come to the United States legally and had earned degrees from schools including the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan and Fordham.But after graduation, the clock was ticking for those who wanted to stay in the country. A program called Optional Practical Training lets foreign-born graduates remain for 12 or 36 months, depending on their field. Companies can apply for a temporary skilled worker visa, known as an H-1B, for employees, but around 230,000 people apply annually for the 85,000 visas given out.A number of the students failed to get an H-1B and seemed out of options  with jobs at Facebook, Google and Morgan Stanley on the line. Others were seeking to transfer from colleges they heard were under investigation to stay one step ahead of immigration officials.That is when the University of Northern New Jersey beckoned.According to some students, brokers assured them that they could immediately earn credit hours for their work experience in a program called Curricular Practical Training, without taking classes.It is very much like a honey trap because you have a very, very great temptation being waved in front of these young men and women, said David Grunblatt, co-head of the immigration and nationality group in the labor and employment law department at Proskauer Rose in New Jersey. He represents companies concerned about hiring foreign graduates for practical training.Most of the students were from China and India, where working with brokers is a familiar way of doing business. But in retrospect, they seem to have ignored what should have been red flags, whether because they were overly trusting, willfully ignorant or willing participants in visa fraud.Corey Lee, an immigration lawyer in Manhattan, said: If you didnt go to a class for a year, you should expect something is going on.Ms. Sun, 29, earned a masters degree in art therapy at a Massachusetts college and moved to New York to work for a nonprofit social services agency. (She declined to name the college or the organization because she did not want to endanger her application for a waiver to return to the United States.)Her employer applied for an H-1B visa for her, but she faced a gap of several months before it would come through.Ms. Sun said her broker told her she could work instead of taking classes, but referred her to the university. In February 2015, after she enrolled, Ms. Sun said she called there approximately 20 times; no one responded.If one person called me back and told me it was fake, I would not have gone to the University of Northern New Jersey, Ms. Sun said. What else can I do? I dont know the American system.Louis Farrell, the director of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, part of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said academic nonimmigrant student visas require the holder to enroll in a full course of study and attend and pass all their classes and that they should be wary of any recruiter who promises they can work without restrictions while attending school.But there seem to be inconsistencies in the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services definition of a full course of study. In one entry on its website, it says that the designated school officer can determine a full course of study. Farther down, it says that a student must complete at least 18 hours of classroom study.Ultimately, the students said that because the Department of Homeland Securitys website certified the University of Northern New Jersey, they believed the institution was legitimate. In addition, the website of the New Jersey Education Department listed it as approved. So did the website of the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, a national body. Its director, Michale S. McComis, later said he had certified the university in order to cooperate with the governments investigation.Z., who is 27 and also from China, did not win the H-1B lottery. He found the University of Northern New Jersey online without a broker. How risky will it be for obtaining full-time C.P.T. without attending any classes? he wrote to the university in an email he showed to The New York Times, referring to Curricular Practical Training.The response, from the generic info@unnj.edu: If you are not comfortable with what we have offered, I ask you to try another university in the New Jersey area.Without a direct answer, Z. said he fell back on the universitys government accreditation. A year passed.When he asked how he would provide evidence for another H-1B application, the university suggested making up classes from a template, and to send it in with $620.That was the final flag. Unlike students who were listed as co-conspirators, Z. did not fabricate school transcripts. Instead, he transferred.But on April 5, his student status was terminated because he had been enrolled at the fake university for more than 45 days.K., a 30-year-old from China who earned an M.B.A. in New England, began to suspect something about the university after he had worked for a year and did not hear about the start of classes. I was wondering if there was a lecture or something I could attend, he said. His broker told him online classes were coming soon.K. said that he, too, relied on the universitys accreditations. If the government is not trustworthy, who should we trust? he said.His girlfriend, S., 26, whom he met at business school, was accepted to the university the next year, in January 2016. But she said the broker told her that her authorization form and the school schedule would be delayed while the university expanded to two more campuses.The couple went to the campus in Cranford in March, only to find the doors locked, supposedly because it was spring break.Then at 8:20 a.m. on April 5, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents knocked on the door of their rural New England home.K. and S. were detained in separate cells for several hours. The next day, K. resigned from his job at a local company. They are both waiting for hearing dates.Like the other students, they were notified that they needed to leave the country or apply for reinstatement of their student visas. But students have said that few colleges, if any, have been willing to sponsor them after they were tainted by the University of Northern New Jersey. Reinstatement ultimately depends on the governments approval.The students say they have been put in an untenable position financially. They paid thousands of dollars either to brokers or directly to the university. Eight students alone said they spent a combined $46,000. Some paid the university via PayPal or cash, with the money going to a holding company listed on some students invoices: Waterfall Properties.As they wait for a hearing in immigration court that could take a year or longer, they cannot legally work.Typically in any fraud investigation, it is our policy that we do not refund any money, Mr. Phillips, the Homeland Security spokesman, said.Absolutely there was a message, Mr. Phillips added. We welcome international students in America, but they must do so according to the standards, the right way.But Barmak Nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, wondered why government officials bothered to create a fake university when such places already existed. Several fraudulent universities have been shut down in previous years.The brokers may have recognized the University of Northern New Jersey as a visa mill, Mr. Nassirian said, but he could see how some students could be deceived by its certifications. Can you really blame a student, he said, even if they are a little greedy, a little gullible, or a little too hopeful?"}

The downside of all those personal connections is that when things go wrong, they go very wrong.As Katie Benner reports, Xfund, a venture capital firm, was formed two years ago and manages more than $100 million. It has put money into start-ups like the genetics company 23andMe. But a dispute between its two partners over the firing of an employee ballooned into allegations of abuse, hidden cameras and an investigation by the funds investors.This could be amusing to Silicon Valley haters, a bit of schadenfreude for the type of people who say they are changing the world but more often than not invest in food delivery apps. Except for one thing  the money.As we glorify or villify venture capitalists, we often forget that they are usually playing with other peoples money. So when they mess up, its usually at someone elses expense. At Xfund, investors had to come up with a way to salvage the fund. In other words, find a way to make sure their money wasnt flushed down the drain."}
{"text": "Members of the Budapest Festival Orchestra, which under the leadership of the conductor Ivan Fischer has become a world-class ensemble and one of Hungarys most important cultural exports, is planning a demonstration on Saturday to protest a steep cut in funding from the city of Budapest.While the orchestra gets most of its support from the state, it also receives aid from the city. The orchestra said that its municipal aid was reduced by more than three-quarters last month, cutting its overall budget for the current year by 7 percent. The orchestra said that it planned to cancel some concerts in Budapest and community and education projects.Mr. Fischer has emerged as an outspoken figure in Hungary as the country has drifted rightward in recent years. In 2013 he performed his opera The Red Heifer there that served as a rebuke to what some saw as a growing tolerance for anti-Semitism in the country.In The Times of London this week, Richard Morrison raised the possibility that there was a more sinister reason than austerity behind the recent cuts. He quoted a statement from the mayor of  Budapest, Istvan Tarlos, that warned that if Mr. Fischer is not capable of putting a stop to his demanding hysterics, threats and troublemaking, we shall have to rethink our support."}
{"text": "When I started running 10 years ago, my family thought it was a funny thing to do. This was in 2006, two years before a running boom took hold in the United States and put a race in my small corner of New Jersey just about every fall and spring weekend. I did my first 5K because a magazine asked me to run it and report back on what was then still a somewhat novel fitness activity. I continued to run because it helped me deal with a romantic breakup, work stress and the ups and downs of being a human being.My mother, who wasnt allowed to run in high school because she was a girl, came with me to some of those first races. She was there to cheer, but after a while, she got bored with watching. She also complained that she was overweight and out of shape.I saw you running and everybody else running, and I thought, I can do that too, she told me. I took her to buy her first pair of running shoes. She ran her first 5K at age 58, and for her second, I walked/ran beside her, my foot in an air cast, during her towns Fourth of July race.It wasnt long after that my brother and sister-in-law started to run, completing half marathons. My sister and her husband joined the family bandwagon, finishing a 5K, then a half-marathon, then a full marathon. My dad, who is divorced from my mom but remains on friendly terms, kept track of all of our Facebook posts about running and listened in on our conversations about running. This past December, I took him to buy his first pair of running shoes, too.My thing had become their thing. At family parties and holidays and even a recent extended family vacation to Walt Disney World, running shoes and fuel and race schedules entered the rotation of safe discussion topics, along with the Philadelphia Phillies, Eagles and the Jersey Shore.So when I decided to run the 2016 New Jersey Marathon, on May 1, I was happy when my sister told me shed be joining me, and my mom said shed run the half that would be held on the same course on the same day. I thought it would be a fun family activity, especially the week before Mothers Day.But Id forgotten that I become a basket of nervous energy and stress before a race, a trait that my family appears to share. On the car ride to the starting line, my dad, who was driving, got mad about traffic. Then my sister got mad at him for being mad about traffic. Then I got mad at her for getting mad at my dad for being mad about traffic. Then she yelled at me for flipping out.As the starting time grew nearer, our car barely inched ahead. After my sisters snap, no one talked. My brain was stuck on the foot injury Id sustained three weeks before, wondering if Id finish the race. My mother sat quietly beside me, knowing better than to step in.And thats when I asked myself: Why didnt I just run my marathon alone?By the time my dad inched the car to within a half-mile of the starting line, I asked him to pull over, and my sister, mom and I shuffled out into a light drizzle. I didnt want to talk to anyone, not to my mom about my nerves or the ache in my foot, or to my sister about her lost headphones. Nothing. No one. I wanted to be left alone with my dread.But when the race started, that feeling receded with every mile crossed. My foot didnt hurt so much anymore. The downpour theyd been forecasting never came.My corral started ahead of my sisters, but I knew shed beat me because of my interrupted training. I was grateful around mile six when she checked in on me and asked how my foot was doing as she passed by.Seeing my usually mellow dad jumping up and down and screaming at mile 9.5, while my brother yelled at me that I was losing the race and to run faster, gave me a jolt of energy. Thats when I knew Id run the full thing instead of bailing at the half-marathon mark.My boyfriend greeted me with a cowbell at mile 18, another boost that helped me press on.At mile 19, runners turn around to head to the finish line, and when I saw my sister running south as I still ran north, I screamed at her that shed better keep up that pace and beat me.At mile 20, my boyfriend met me again, and I told him Id make the last 6.2 miles.When I came through the final yards of the marathon to break my previous personal record  one that Id set on that course in 2013  my dad was there and ready with his camera. My mom had finished her own half-marathon and was waiting for me just beyond the finish line, a medal draped around her neck.No one had come to my first two marathons. Before my third, my dad told me that if I died, hed be the one to bury me, and all had been pretty solitary affairs. So for this marathon, my sixth, I felt honored to have my mom and sister on the course with me, and my dad and brother and his wife and my boyfriend there cheering me on. And though Ill be taking a break from marathons while I recover, I cant wait to cheer them on at their next running events.Jen A.

{"text": "Three-point records have fallen rapidly this season, mostly to the mighty Warriors. On April 24, Golden State made 21 in a first-round game against the Rockets, setting a playoff record.But on Wednesday night, the Cavaliers took that record away and added another: Cleveland hit 25 3-pointers, not just the most in a playoff game, but more than the regular-season record, as well.The Cavaliers 3-point marksmanship has been overlooked this season in the shadow of the Warriors. While Golden State made 1,077 3-pointers, a record, Cleveland made 880 of its own, the fifth-highest total of all time. J. R. Smith led the way with 204, but Kevin Love, Matthew Dellavedova, LeBron James and many others had 3-point punch, as well.Ten Cavaliers made 3s in Wednesdays game. Smith hit seven, one off his season high, and James and Kyrie Irving had four each.J. R. is the only one on the team who has the ultra-green light, James told reporters after the game. Its fluorescent.Even Dahntay Jones, who played most of the season for the Grand Rapids Drive of the N.B.A. Development League, drained one in his five minutes on the court.The Cavaliers shot 25 for 45 from 3-point range. They tried and made more 3s than 2s, and shot them at a higher percentage, .556.The Hawks could not stand up to the barrage of 3s. They were never in the game and lost, 123-98. Atlanta was 11 for 27 from 3-point range, and no player made more than two.With Kevin posting the basketball, smaller guys have to double-team, Coach Tyronn Lue explained to The Cleveland Plain Dealer. With LeBron being aggressive and driving the ball to the basket, and Kyrie getting to the basket, teams are trying to shut the driving lanes off. That makes for guys kicking it out.The regular-season record is 23, shared by the 2009 Magic against the Kings (Jameer Nelson made five) and the 2013 Rockets against the Warriors (Jeremy Lin also made five).Since the adoption of the 3-point shot, teams have been hoisting up bombs in hopes of stealing a last-second win, rallying from a deficit or punctuating a win. And while the 3-pointer was initially dismissed as a gimmick, to be used only in unusual situations, it has increasingly become a crucial weapon.Just about every 3-point record that can be thought up has fallen in the last few seasons. Golden States Stephen Curry made 402 this season, shattering his own record of 286 from the season before. The Warriors set the team record, and N.B.A. teams made, on average, 8.5 3s a game, up from 5.7 a decade ago and 0.8 in 1979-80, the shots first season.After a sweep of the Pistons (with 12, 20, 12 and 13 3-pointers), the Cavaliers now lead the Hawks, two games to none (15 and 25).The Cavaliers are 6-0 and untroubled in the playoffs so far. Playing in the weaker Eastern Conference, they look like a good bet to make the finals.The result of a potential Cavaliers-Warriors series is uncertain. But it is a sure thing the 3s would be raining down."}
{"text": "KARMEI YOSEF, Israel  When David Woo and Margalit Shinar decided to buy a house after 28 years of a peripatetic life together, Israel was the only option for the couple, but it was not an obvious choice.They had spent most of their life together in London, Washington and New York, where Mr. Woo is a managing partner and heads the research desk at Bank of America.Mr. Woo, now 48, is Taiwanese by birth, but left home when he was 15, to study in the United States. He met Ms. Shinar, 20 years his senior, when he was in college at Tufts University in Massachusetts, and she was studying for her masters degree.Twenty eight years later, the time had come to settle down. Ms. Shinar, an American by birth who was raised in Israel, is 68 and wanted to return to the land where her family still lives.The only question was where.They knew they wanted a house, something pastoral, with a large garden and not too many neighbors.The communities along Israels coastline, where the agricultural lands have become suburban enclaves, were not quite right. They were either too expensive, or had crowded lots that did not leave enough room for privacy.A real estate agent specializing in country properties took them to Moshav Karmei Yosef, an agricultural community in the Judean foothills that is mentioned in the Bible and is still home to many farms, as well as two wineries.The first plot they looked at was the former home of Ida Nudel, a former Soviet refusenik who had been gifted the land by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Ms. Nudel had planted an extensive garden full of plants and trees mentioned in the Bible, and it radiated peacefulness and calm.When I saw this place, I said, thats it, its done, Mr. Woo said. Youre buying for the plot and this lot is particularly lovely. It has gentle terrain and we fell in love with the garden. Its like magic.The half-acre garden behind the house slopes down toward a private, locked gate that leads to a public forest next door, the houses very own secret garden.They call this area Little Tuscany, Ms. Shinar said. We even have a monastery nearby and olive trees and wineries.There were also no looming houses nearby, said Ms. Shinar, who wanted to be far from the madding crowds.People told me I wouldnt last here, that I would die from being so far from urban life. But what seduced us is the proximity to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.Karmei Yosef is halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, about a 30-minute drive to either city.There was a simple house already on the property, but Ms. Shinar had never considered living in someone elses home.The idea that I would buy someone elses house never crossed my mind, said Ms. Shinar, an architect by training whose former husband and daughter are also architects. And Im fussy. I want this and not that, and especially in Israel, which has very young architecture, the chances of finding something Id really like and afford, well, there was practically no chance.They began working with an architect, but when Ms. Shinars architect daughter, Kedem Shinar, helped solve a particular troubling issue with the black iron staircase leading to the second floor, Ms. Shinar knew she had found the right professional.Mr. Woo felt the same way.We wanted something modern; we didnt want to build another Tuscan villa in Israel, said Mr. Woo, referring to the style of some of the nearby houses. We wanted something original, so almost by definition you go down the path of modern, but modern with a soul, that would be homey, with the context of Israel. And we wanted a garden and to draw inspiration from the East.Kedem Shinar earned her architectural degree in Japan, where she lived for four years. More important, the two women and Mr. Woo share a similar aesthetic, she said.We see eye to eye on many things, Kedem Shinar said of her mother and Mr. Woo.Mr. Woo, a longtime New Yorker, loves lofts and wanted the airy, spacious feeling of a high-ceilinged loft in the country. He is a tall man, and did not want to feel cramped in any space. Finally, the couple are writing a novel together and wanted to be sure to have plenty of nooks that would encourage creativity.What they created was the sum of all those parts. The square, spare house, 350 square meters on a half-acre plot, is large and airy, but not too big, which settled Ms. Shinar, who has lived most of her life in fairly small spaces.The double-door entrance on the eastern side of the Bauhaus-inspired house leads into a spacious public space, divided into an airy living room and dining area furnished with Eames-inspired pieces, including a comfortable, twill-covered L-shaped couch, Turkish rugs and a long plank dining table. The focus, however, is on the interplay of walls and windows leading out to the garden, with double-height windows and sliding doors open to the garden and the forest of cypress and fir trees beyond.I was scared stiff of double-height windows, Ms. Shinar said. I was brought up in Israel, where you dont open big windows to the sun.The house has a northern exposure, however, with sun coming from the east in the morning, but never any direct sunlight. The wraparound sliding doors offer complete exposure to the garden, creating one of the houses many frames to the garden, Mr. Woo said.The open kitchen is on the other side of the public space, taking up a spacious corner by the back door that opens onto the kitchen garden, planted with herbs for easy picking. With the burners set into the kitchen island and liberal use of wood and metal in the cupboard doors and surfaces, Ms. Shinar has the efficient, attractive work space that she lacks in their New York apartment, while Mr. Woo has the right kind of space for cooking Chinese food, which can create a lot of smoke.An upper gallery houses the floor-to-ceiling library and office, with a wood-and-iron bridge that floats over the double-height living room. And while the palette of the house is mostly neutral, from the poured concrete floors and wooden elements to the iron doors and stair treads, there are many touches of color, from the area rugs, textiles and bright orange barstools set at the kitchen counter.Ms. Shinar also preferred creating a modern interpretation of something local, whether it was her kitchen window designed with glass squares framed in metal, known as a Belgian window in Israel, or the iron staircase, in homage to the ironworks seen in many Israeli homes.If youre in Jerusalem, you have to use Jerusalem stone, she said, referring to the citys law requiring facades of the creamy limestone, but for me, stucco is Israel, and so are Belgian windows and cement floors, because thats what Israelis use. You want to be able to live in it, and put things down on the counters and tables, without ruining some composition.On the west side of the house is the iron staircase that leads up to the master bedroom, also offering a full view of the garden and forest beyond. Downstairs is a guest room and on the side of the house is another apartment with a separate entrance that can be used for guests or family. Like all the other rooms, it faces the forest, said Kedem Shinar, pointing to the wraparound windows.Were always oriented toward the garden, she said.For Kedem Shinar, it was important to include those elements of Eastern influence, although she is aware of how much she has to learn from the enigmatic culture.Im careful when I mention being influenced by Japan, she said. Its not about copy-and-paste or planting bamboos. I consciously tried to take some of the elements that I had deeply learned and understood.One of the elements she included is the concrete and wood deck that leads from the living room  a mix of materials that was cheaper and more practical, and also blended with the colors of the garden  and floats, Japanese style, over the garden. It is a concept found in traditional Japanese houses and shrines, creating a strong connection between inside and outside, she said.Mr. Woo said, If we wanted to build a house that was totally integrated with nature, we could have lowered the house to the level of the garden. I think the reason the Japanese create a little distance is to allow you to contemplate nature and enjoy it. Its not totally being part of it, but its a reverential thing.The garden, which slopes down toward the forest and is divided into different zones, has areas where Mr. Woo and Ms. Shinar can sit on a bench and contemplate their surroundings, work on a tale or weed in the garden. Theres an English-style garden outside the front door, with tall, colorful flower beds of Mediterranean flora, a fruit and olive tree orchard and a grape arbor being developed toward the back, near the secret door leading to the forest.The house is respectful of nature, but its not an environmental house, Ms. Shinar said; its a more of a philosophical approach.Mr. Woo said he often wondered if, like them, Ms. Nudel, the Soviet refusenik, preferred the forest to the mountainous side of the community.Im sure she did, Ms. Shinar said. The mountain offers drama, the forest offers peace."}

{"text": "RALEIGH, N.C.  The Republican leaders of North Carolinas General Assembly defiantly announced Thursday that they would not meet a Monday deadline to suspend or repeal a state law limiting bathroom access for transgender people, setting up a potential legal showdown over what has become one of the nations most explosive cultural issues.We will take no action by Monday, said Tim Moore, the speaker of the State House of Representatives, referring to the deadline the Justice Department gave the state to tell federal officials whether the law would stand. That deadline will come and go.Though Mr. Moore criticized the deadline as unreasonable, he also seemed to signal that Republicans might eventually agree to alter the law, which forbids people to use public building restrooms that do not match the gender listed on their birth certificates.The legislative process doesnt work where a response can be given by just a few days, he said, so were going to move at the speed that were going to move at to look at what our options are at this point.His comments, as well as a private meeting later with a leading critic of the law, Mayor Jennifer Roberts of Charlotte, were indications that lawmakers here may be concerned about the potentially damaging consequences of keeping the law intact and defying the Justice Department.The Obama administration contends that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and its finding could push the federal government to withhold in federal aid.The law puts more than $4.8 billion in federal funding to state and local governments at risk, according to a recent analysis by the Williams Institute, a research organization at the University of California, Los Angeles, law school that focuses on sexual orientation and gender identity law. The bulk of those losses would be from education funds, though the state could also lose money for career services, health care, housing and other purposes.We had a productive discussion, and were looking for solutions, and I look forward to further dialogue, said Ms. Roberts, whose citys effort to protect transgender people spurred the legislative drive that produced the law. She made her comments after she huddled for more than an hour with Mr. Moore and Senator Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the State Senate.Neither Ms. Roberts nor Mr. Berger, one of the most influential Republicans in the General Assembly, ruled out additional meetings. We had a conversation, Mr. Berger said. Everyone had an opportunity to express where they are. I think everybodys looking for solutions and hope to continue to have further conversations.Wednesdays letter from the Justice Department brought new urgency to a debate that has surrounded the General Assembly for more than a month. In a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, the departments top civil rights lawyer warned that the law was a violation of the Civil Rights Act because North Carolina was engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination against transgender state employees.The letter notes pointedly that the Justice Department could seek a court order to ensure compliance with the Civil Rights Act when it has reason to believe that such a pattern exists.Mr. McCrory, who is in a tough re-election fight, signed the law hours after the Legislature approved it in a one-day special session in March, arguing that it was a common-sense matter of privacy and public safety.But the law, which also prohibits local governments from passing anti-discrimination ordinances, prompted a fierce outcry from gay rights activists, as well as several major corporate leaders, some of whom canceled plans to create jobs in the state.That has brought severe headaches for Mr. McCrory, allowing his Democratic rival this autumn, Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has said he will not defend the law in court, to argue that the governor has not been the good steward of the state economy that he claims to be. In local and national news media, the debate over the law has largely eclipsed Mr. McCrorys argument that he has engineered a Carolina Comeback by cutting corporate tax rates and enacting other pro-business policies.Mr. McCrory  who is not as conservative as the legislative leadership and has clashed with them in the past  remained silent on Thursday amid speculation that he might be considering some kind of unilateral action to stave off litigation by the Justice Department.But several legal experts, as well as some members of the General Assembly, said the governor did not have the ability to suspend or revoke the law. Gerry Cohen, a lawyer, lobbyist and former bill drafting director for the Legislature, said that the matter was settled by the North Carolina Constitution, which states that no authority may suspend a law without legislative consent.Norma Houston, a faculty member at the University of North Carolina School of Government, agreed. But she said that Mr. McCrory did have the ability to engage in settlement negotiations leading to the suspension or revocation of the law.Mr. McCrory could raise that option with the Justice Department, Ms. Houston said. He could also direct lawyers for the state to enter into a negotiated settlement of a pending federal lawsuit that challenged the bathroom law in late March, in hopes of arriving at an outcome that satisfies the plaintiffs and the Justice Department.If a protracted lawsuit cannot be avoided, the political effect would be mostly bad for Mr. McCrory, said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Stuff like that just interrupts and creates static at the core of his campaign, Mr. Guillory said. It again raises a question about whether the governing authorities in Raleigh are on top of things.At a White House news briefing Thursday afternoon, the press secretary, Josh Earnest, was asked if the letter was meant to send a signal to other states that pass similar legislation.Mr. Earnest replied by saying the decision to inform Mr. McCrory that North Carolina had violated federal law was made by the Justice Department, and independent of any sort of political interference or direction from the White House.At the Legislative Building here on Thursday, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican, accused the federal government of engaging in extortion by effectively threatening to withhold federal aid for education. And he said that he did not expect Mr. McCrory to do anything to block the law.I expect the governor to stand strong, he said."}
{"text": "In the summer of 2010, the troop surge in Afghanistan was underway, and for months my infantry unit  part of the 101st Airborne Division  had been training for what we were told was going to be a big and possibly bloody fight. On a tiny base in Kyrgyzstan, the day before we flew into Afghanistan, I met a soldier who had just left the district in Kandahar where my unit was headed for a yearlong tour. He told me it was bad, and I could tell that he wasnt lying. He said a lot of us were going to die.To say I was scared is an understatement. I was petrified. Alcohol is off limits when youre deployed, so to calm my nerves, I went to the Internet cafe on base and began looking up famous battles from American history. I wanted to read about others who had faced the kind of heavy combat I was certain Id soon experience. I needed real-life examples of bravery, of men who had experienced the level of fear I was experiencing and had pushed through it. A pep talk from some officer wasnt going to cut it.Ordinary people doing extraordinary things in combat: Thats the stuff I was after. And of course I found plenty of examples in valorous awards citations of enlisted American soldiers who had fought in World War II. I read their stories late into the night. Reading them didnt cure my fear, not by a long shot, but they provided me with the perspective I needed at that moment. If those soldiers could do what they did, and on battlefields as perilous as the ones they encountered in places like Bastogne and Iwo Jima, I could handle the improvised explosive devices and sniper fire that awaited me in Kandahar, which, by comparison, seemed manageable.This week, those stories came back to me when I heard that James Bradley, the author of Flags of Our Fathers, which chronicles the raising of the American flag during the battle of Iwo Jima, acknowledged that his father might not have been one of the Marines featured in Joe Rosenthals iconic photograph. For many people, Id imagine, this isnt a big deal. After all, its just a photo. And Mr. Bradleys father, John, a Navy corpsman who was wounded during the battle, did, in fact, raise a flag at Iwo Jima that day, but he wasnt a member of the patrol that raised the second flag  the scene that would become legend.So does it really matter that one of the guys in the photograph isnt who we thought he was? For many veterans, like me, it does. John Bradley may very well have thought, as his son believed, that he was one of the six men in the photograph, but evidence to the contrary has existed since Day 1. The Marine Corps has stood firmly behind this story for nearly 70 years, and some amateur sleuths proved it wrong. Thats a problem. Ensuring these stories are as accurate as possible is an obligation of the United States military.When young soldiers or Marines turn to these stories for inspiration and courage, they must have faith in their legitimacy. They must believe, as I did, that they are fact, not fiction. But, more important, they must know that the military will go to whatever lengths necessary to set the record straight in the event that they, too, find themselves at a crucial juncture in history. Id like to believe that most soldiers dont go to war in pursuit of glory, but glory is part of the deal.By any standard, John Bradley was a hero: a combat veteran who raised the American flag over the black sands of Iwo Jima. His glory is not in dispute, but the facts are, and we owe it to his memory and to everyone who has ever put on the uniform to ensure that these pivotal moments in war history are true.Look at a Medal of Honor citation. Its a painstakingly detailed account of a single heroic act  a blow-by-blow description of a life-or-death event as it occurred over the course of hours, minutes or even seconds. Its written that way because in combat detail is paramount, not only while its unfolding, but afterward, when we begin the process of evaluating what went wrong or right and giving credit where credit is due. When a soldier rushes through a hail of bullets to neutralize a bunker, or tightrope-walks through a minefield to save a fallen comrade, he or she can take a certain level of comfort in knowing that the military doesnt treat such acts lightly. Preserving the integrity of the stories that emerge from the battlefield is important because the mythology of war does a lot more than inspire by real-life example. It reassures the war fighter that the sacrifices he or she makes, or is willing to make, in combat wont be misplaced or forgotten.By the time my initial fear of being in Afghanistan gave way to anger and boredom, I was, I think, willing to die for the cause. Some of my friends did. On one occasion, a photographer was there. Six of our guys were buried under the rubble of a compound that had been struck by a car bomb. More than a few of us were crying as we scrambled to retrieve their lifeless bodies. I watched a distraught staff sergeant run over to the photographer, whose presence at that moment felt intrusive, and tell him to go away.The photos were published in The New York Times the next day, and there we were: a bunch of soldiers clawing desperately at a pile of rubble. Eventually, everyone, including the sergeant, agreed it was a good thing. The photos were for us. It was our story, in all its agony and truth. Six years later, its the only record we have of that terrible day."}
{"text": "Visitors to Frieze New York, one of the art industrys larger trade shows, housed in a white tent on Randalls Island, are greeted by what could be taken as a new fair branding symbol: a giant, helium-inflated figure of a fat, howling baby with a tiny brainpan and an immense open mouth.Titled Free Money, this 25-foot-high outdoor sculpture is the work of the young American artist Alex Da Corte, who has based his career on sending pop culture through the spin cycle. In this case, he appropriates an image from Tim Burtons 1989 Batman. In the film, to bring out the people of Gotham, the Joker stages a parade with flashy floats, like this one, promising to cap the event with a shower of cash. What the crowds get instead, though, is a fog of poison gas.This is an apt image for an art fair, even if a fairs only conspicuous killer effect is to raise the worlds quotient of junk art and the prices paid for it. Frieze, which originated in London a quarter-century ago, certainly contributes to these spikes, and is geared to an audience that wants to see what it already knows. Its main value lies, however, in shining light on some unfamiliar galleries and in bringing forward art we might not otherwise see.Absorbing the whole event, which runs through Sunday, requires strategizing, helped somewhat by the fairs organization into several almost manageable parts. Mr. Da Cortes colicky kid, for example, is one of a group of special projects commissioned from individual artists. The more than 200 galleries participating are divided into four broad categories.The largest consists of galleries that have been in business long and profitably enough to be able to afford the fairs steep expenses. The smaller Focus section is made of galleries established since 2004 and showing work that hasnt previously appeared in an art fair. Under the label Frame come relative newbies, galleries eight years old or younger. A section called Spotlight offers what passes for history at this fair: solo shows of 20th-century art from the 1960s forward.There are rewards in all categories. If youre a shopper itchy to lay down some bucks, you may find general inventory displays, with a few things by several artists, most attractive, and there are plenty of these. Some mix this and that, gallery artists with resale items. Youll find plenty of these. Others are artful installations in themselves.Theres a beauty at the New York gallery Salon 94, where Judy Chicagos moody, spray-painted 1983 EU-22 Earth Birth is on the same fluid wavelength as a picture by the Sudanese painter Ibrahim el-Salahi, and both gain in sensuality from the contrasting presence of tough pieces by the great Pakistan-born American sculptor Huma Bhabha and the Japanese ceramist Kentaro Kawabata.Other group shows are less striking for coherence than for including extraordinary individual artists. At Broadway 1602, a downtown New York space recently relocated to Harlem, youll find two in the American Pop artists Idelle Weber and the Polish sculptor Wanda Czelkowska, both with work from the 1960s. And a four-artist show at Foksal Gallery Foundation, from Warsaw, is particularly interesting for the presence of drawings by Erna Rosenstein (1913-2004), an artist-poet with a rich story and vibrant hand. (She was recently in Unorthodox at the Jewish Museum here.)A wall of wild and dirty little doll-puppets by a Belgian duo, Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys, makes Gavin Browns Enterprise a destination. And two galleries from Bogot, Colombia, are well worth tracking down for a glimpse of wonderful artists all but unknown here. Casas Riegner has tiny abstract paintings on woven fabrics by Carlos Rojas (1933-1997) and two figurative paintings by the political artist Beatriz Gonzlez, subject of an unforgettable 1998 retrospective at El Museo del Barrio and still hard at work in her 80s.A second gallery, Instituto de Visin, with Alberto Baraya, Otto Berchem, Pia Camil and Wilson Daz, was awarded one of two Frieze Stand Prizes this year for its visually and thematically striking mix. A comparable award might have gone to Andrea Rosen Gallery, a staple of New Yorks Chelsea, which brings together a funky Mika Rottenberg air-conditioner piece; a mirrored installation with coconuts by David Altmejd, a faux hot spring by Hayden Dunham, and all-but-blank paintings by Simon Fujiwara. For some reason it all clicks.Mr. Fujiwara also has a solo at Taro Nasu, a gallery from Tokyo. As a viewing experience, the one-artist format is particularly satisfying, maybe because its conducive to concentration. Some such shows, like the Dumpsters-worth of Damien Hirsts at Gagosian, are a drag, but others cast a spell even in a fairs mall-like atmosphere. Theres a magnetic example in a multipart installation by David Wojnarowicz at P.P.O.W., made in 1985 and virtually unseen since, just inside one of the fairs two entrances, and another, almost invisibly casual, by a newcomer, Ann Cathrin November Hoibo, at Standard (Oslo), just inside the other one.In general, solo shows are the way to go. Many combine the fairs least splashy material with the brightest thinking. At Stevenson Gallery from Cape Town, South Africa, theres an invaluable mini-survey of Moshekwa Langas art, something almost impossible to imagine in almost any New York commercial space, Skoto Gallery in Chelsea being an exception. Similarly, only Aicon Gallery, isolated on a block near the Bowery, is likely to come up with the focused look at the Indian modernist S. H. Raza that it gives us here. Barbara Thumm, from Berlin, brings early paintings by Jo Baer: Who remembers that an artist associated with geometric abstraction, once did, and is now again doing, big, Surrealist-inspired figurative things?The fairs Spotlight section provides refresher courses in the careers of Alan Shields (his fabulous early 1970s Inverted Gumdrop, all painted canvas strips and hippie beads, is at Van Doren Waxter) and in those of two conceptualists, David Ireland (at Anglim Gilbert, San Francisco) and Mary Kelly. Ms. Kellys work at the Pippy Houldsworth Gallery, London, includes a 1974 study for her Post-Partum Document, a project that examined maternity as a form of labor and caused an uproar by incorporating her childs feces-stained diapers. She remains a linchpin presence in the history of international feminism.Save Londons Parafin gallery for a spell of quiet time with Nancy Holts exceptionally beautiful and seldom seen 1968 Western Graveyards series of photographs. Haunting in a different way are the photographs called Reconciliation Studies, by Howard Fried at the Box, from Los Angeles. The pictures are all of clothes from Mr. Frieds mothers wardrobe, taken after her death in 2002. The individual items depicted are also for sale as art objects, though with contractual strings attached. For details, talk to the gallery staff, who will be wearing some of the outfits during the fair.For many New Yorkers, Mr. Fried will be a discovery. Isnt discovery what fairs should be for? Check out the spicy political work of the Mexican painter, performer and book publisher Felipe Ehrenberg, at Baro Galeria, from So Paulo; and the witty kinetic art of Abraham Palatnik at Galeria Nara Roesler, another So Paulo space. Finally, a selection of drawings by Denzil Forrester, at the nonprofit White Columns, is both news and a preview of things to come. Born in Grenada in 1956, Mr. Forrester graduated from the Royal College of Art, London, and has been steadily producing large paintings on the theme of reggae dance hall culture. White Columns will organize a New York exhibition of his work in November, but you saw it first here at the fair.What Ive pulled out here is some of what interested me. A lot did not: acres of over-upholstered abstract paintings; fussy machine-tooled sculptures; second-tier auction bait; and tired work by good artists. (William Kentridge, for one, needs a rest.) The blank impression made by new galleries in Frame is particularly dispiriting.Mr. Da Cortes gape-mouthed baby captures some of the big emptiness built into the art fair phenomenon. It also manages the currently popular ploy of being at once critical and self-aggrandizing. The master of this game is Maurizio Cattelan, another of the fairs commissioned artists. A while back, he announced that he was retiring but has since been revisiting it. His Frieze project recreates his first New York gallery solo, in 1994, which was also the last show at the SoHo space run by the dealer Daniel Newburg.For that occasion, Mr. Cattelan installed a chandelier and a live donkey in the gallery, and he has done so again at Frieze. Does this bit of history matter to anyone other than the artist or Mr. Newburg? I doubt it. And whats the piece about: a Goya-like jibe at art world grandiosity and dumbness by someone who has done very well by nibbling away at the hand that feeds him? Whatever, it was of some interest, at the fairs V.I.P. preview, to watch the 1 percent audience that Frieze is custom-designed for, lining up with coffee cups and Champagne flutes and waiting for quite a while to take a look and maybe try to figure it out."}
{"text": "Elstree 1976, a documentary both sweet and bittersweet, might sound as if its only for Star Wars nerds. But in telling a small story of bit players, the director, Jon Spira, captures a more universal picture of the droplets of fame created by a pop-culture tidal wave.The film checks in on a handful of actors who played small parts in the original Star Wars, parts of which were filmed at Elstree Studios near London. They include Dave Prowse, who played Darth Vader (though that characters memorable voice was provided by James Earl Jones), a few other named characters, and some extras who appeared only as Stormtroopers or faces in a crowd.Their anecdotes about how they came to be in the movie and their experiences during filming are delightful, but Mr. Spira also finds a certain melancholy in their tales. Some view their Star Wars moment as just a blip in a long life. Others have embraced the culture that sprang up around the movie, working the convention circuit, and the glimpses of that world are sad somehow, especially the descriptions of a hierarchy in which actors who had defined roles look down on mere extras.Star Wars fans will, of course, love this film, but its also a thought-provoking exploration of the dawning of our current age, in which level of fame doesnt necessarily match up with level of genuine accomplishment, and individuals can find themselves transformed by fast-moving fads and phenomena beyond their control."}
{"text": "The Whit Stillman-esque romantic melodrama Those People goes to great lengths to humanize Manhattans upper crust, with generally successful results. Its hero, Charlie (Jonathan Gordon), a gay 27-year-old painter in graduate school, may have been raised among the Upper East Side elite, but that doesnt keep him from agonized ambivalence when it comes to love. Even in his Manhattan of formal wear, glowing interiors, glittering nighttime streets and leisurely affluence, heartbreak rears its ugly head.Charlie has pined for his childhood friend Sebastian (Jason Ralph) for years. But the dissolute Sebastian  whose Bernie Madoff-like father has just been sent to prison for defrauding his moneyed peers out of millions  keeps Charlie at arms length, playing coy. When Charlie catches the eye of the worldly, slightly older Tim (Haaz Sleiman), a barroom musician and accomplished classical pianist, jealousies and long-repressed feelings emerge amid passionate hookups and tearful confrontations. Just whom will Charlie choose?The director, Joey Kuhn, making his feature debut from his own script, has created fairly credible and sympathetic characters, despite the 1-percenter milieu. The actors, especially Mr. Ralph, who could pass for a distant cousin of Dane DeHaan, are equally persuasive, though the plots contrivances eventually wear thin. Its unfortunate that female characters, including Charlies mother (Allison Mackie) and Charlie and Sebastians friend Ursula (Britt Lower), compared with the men, are given short shrift. But thanks to the cinematographer Leonard DAntoni, the locations, including Lincoln Center and the High Line, have rarely looked lovelier."}

{"text": "How will the news media handle the battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? I suspect I know the answer  and its going to be deeply frustrating. But maybe, just maybe, flagging some common journalistic sins in advance can limit the damage. So lets talk about what can and probably will go wrong in coverage  but doesnt have to.First, and least harmful, will be the urge to make the election seem closer than it is, if only because a close race makes a better story. You can already see this tendency in suggestions that the startling outcome of the fight for the Republican nomination somehow means that polls and other conventional indicators of electoral strength are meaningless.The truth, however, is that polls have been pretty good indicators all along. Pundits who dismissed the chances of a Trump nomination did so despite, not because of, the polls, which have been showing a large Trump lead for more than eight months.Oh, and lets not make too much of any one poll. When many polls are taken, there are bound to be a few outliers, both because of random sampling error and the biases that can creep into survey design. If the average of recent polls shows a strong lead for one candidate  as it does right now for Mrs. Clinton  any individual poll that disagrees with that average should be taken with large helpings of salt.A more important vice in political coverage, which weve seen all too often in previous elections  but will be far more damaging if it happens this time  is false equivalence.You might think that this would be impossible on substantive policy issues, where the asymmetry between the candidates is almost ridiculously obvious. To take the most striking comparison, Mr. Trump has proposed huge tax cuts with no plausible offsetting spending cuts, yet has also promised to pay down U.S. debt; meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton has proposed modest spending increases paid for by specific tax hikes.That is, one candidate is engaged in wildly irresponsible fantasy while the other is being quite careful with her numbers. But beware of news analyses that, in the name of balance, downplay this contrast.This isnt a new phenomenon: Many years ago, when George W. Bush was obviously lying about his budget arithmetic but nobody would report it, I suggested that if a candidate declared that the earth was flat, headlines would read, Shape of the Planet: Both Sides Have a Point. But this year it could be much, much worse.And what about less quantifiable questions about behavior? Ive already seen pundits suggest that both presumptive nominees fight dirty, that both have taken the low road in their campaigns. For the record, Mr. Trump has impugned his rivals manhood, called them liars and suggested that Ted Cruzs father was associated with J.F.K.s killer. On her side, Mrs. Clinton has suggested that Bernie Sanders hasnt done his homework on some policy issues. These things are not the same.Finally, I can almost guarantee that well see attempts to sanitize the positions and motives of Trump supporters, to downplay the racism that is at the heart of the movement and pretend that what voters really care about are the priorities of D.C. insiders  a process I think of as centrification.That is, after all, what happened after the rise of the Tea Party. Ive seen claims that Tea Partiers were motivated by Wall Street bailouts, or even that the movement was largely about fiscal responsibility, driven by voters upset about budget deficits.In fact, there was never a hint that any of these things mattered; if you followed the actual progress of the movement, it was always about white voters angry at the thought that their taxes might be used to help Those People, whether via mortgage relief for distressed minority homeowners or health care for low-income families.Now Im seeing suggestions that Trumpism is driven by concerns about political gridlock. No, it isnt. It isnt even mainly about economic anxiety.Trump support in the primaries was strongly correlated with racial resentment: Were looking at a movement of white men angry that they no longer dominate American society the way they used to. And to pretend otherwise is to give both the movement and the man who leads it a free pass.In the end, bad reporting probably wont change the elections outcome, because the truth is that those angry white men are right about their declining role. America is increasingly becoming a racially diverse, socially tolerant society, not at all like the Republican base, let alone the plurality of that base that chose Donald Trump.Still, the public has a right to be properly informed. The news media should do all it can to resist false equivalence and centrification, and report whats really going on."}
{"text": "Chip Foley has competed in 50 triathlons, but now hes turning his focus upside down. My ultimate goal is to be able to do a handstand and hold it for 30 seconds, he said.To achieve the feat, he is pursuing a rigorous training regimen: attending daily classes at Lyons Den Power Yoga, a studio in TriBeCa that specializes in hot yoga; studying handstand videos on YouTube; and doing core-strengthening exercises at home four or five times a week. Im obsessed with it, said Mr. Foley, 38, who spends his right-side-up time as the owner of a Manhattan-based technology consulting firm.Why the fixation? Social media could be the culprit. Sarah Turk, a lead analyst with IBISWorld, a market research firm, said yoga poses lent themselves to showing off. And Instagram has the numbers to support that statement: The hashtag yogaeverydamnday has racked up over five million posts; #handstand and #handstands, over 400,000.Theres a level of badassness to it, said Metta Murdaya, 41, who has been working on her handstand for the past two years. Ms. Murdaya, co-founder of JUARA Skincare, said her inversion practice made her feel more confident, fearless and focused, which she channels into her work as an entrepreneur.Literally, you succeed because you refuse to fail, she said.The rise of the inversion comes with the rise of the yoga and Pilates industry in the United States, which brought in an estimated $9.1 billion in 2015, according to an IBISWorld report prepared by Ms. Turk. A Yoga in America study recently found that the number of yoga students increased to 36 million in 2016 from 20.4 million in 2012.Owners of trendy studios that have cropped up to meet New Yorkers demands for new ways to practice yoga, like Lyons Den, Pure Yoga and Y7 Studio, said that they had noticed an uptick in requests for inversion workshops and time devoted to handstands and headstands in class. Y7, which holds yoga classes set to pop and hip-hop music in rooms heated by infrared light, has already held four sold-out, two-hour inversion workshops this year, said Sarah Larson Levey, a founder of the studio.Kiley Holliday, who teaches at Pure Yoga and Equinox in Manhattan, says handstands are popular among her students because of the feeling of accomplishment they experience when they are finally able to do them.Inversions help students be present in the moment, a perennial objective among yogis, she added. You will never be more focused than when you are upside down, Ms. Holliday said. It is impossible to think of anything else than what you are doing.The danger, of course, is taking a tumble, which for many is a rite of passage. We all fall, said Lauren Abramowitz, 39, founder of Park Avenue Skin Solutions, who has posted pictures of herself online in an advanced-level scorpion pose (a handstand with a backbend). Its not a matter of if, its how do you get back up.Dr. Gregory Galano, an orthopedic surgeon affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital, said he often saw patients with yoga-related injuries. Doing repetitive or long-lasting handstands can lead to everything from low-grade wrist sprains and tendinitis to more serious labral tears in the shoulder, he said.He recommends that people slowly work up to more challenging poses. You want to do things in a controlled and safe manner, Dr. Galano said.To that end, the trainer Kira Stokes prepares students for handstands with a variety of core-strengthening moves in her Stoked 360 class at BFX Studio, the studio brand of New York Sports Clubs, owned by Town Sports International. One of her favorite exercises, a pike on a stability ball that involves bringing the hips over the shoulders, also helps improve shoulder stability and balance.Its more than a good party trick, Ms. Stokes said of achieving a handstand. It takes strength, balance, coordination and body awareness  all in one move. She likes to do them, she said, because the practice boosts my energy and is great for the circulatory system.For those who are starting out, just propping your legs against a wall and breathing deeply can give you some of the same energy-boosting benefits, said Sally Melanie Lourenco, a yoga and meditation teacher. A lot of people arent comfortable flipping their world upside down.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}

Trumps being the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.She described herself as a voter as a provisional Trump and a never Hillary, referring to the leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.Pressed on Thursday about why she switched political parties, Ms. Matalin told Bloomberg Politics that she was a Republican in the Jeffersonian, Madisonian sense.Im not a Republican for a party or a person, she continued. The Libertarian Party represents those constitutional principles that I agree with.Of Mr. Trump, Ms. Matalin said she liked his attitude and what she knew of his economic policies, adding: I just dont know enough. I think not only could he win, I think he could win in a landslide if he would stop his high school boy antics with women; otherwise hes going to force suburban women to Hillary.She said conservatives were angry after two successive presidential elections in which they lost and with what appeared to be no response from Washington as the party was falling apart.Ms. Matalin is probably best known for her appearances on television as a staunch defender of Republican policies. For more than a decade, she appeared on CNN with her husband, James Carville, a Democratic strategist.The husband-and-wife team were two of the networks best-known contributors. For years they were co-hosts of Crossfire. After it was canceled, they were regulars on The Situation Room and election night specials. They announced in early 2013 that they were parting ways with CNN.Ms. Matalin was President George Bushs campaign director and was assistant to President George W. Bush. She was also assistant and counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney, according to her website.She worked at the Republican National Committee in 1984 as national voter contact director for the Reagan-Bush campaign and later as chief of staff to the chairman of the committee."}
{"text": "Mayor Bill de Blasios prospects of getting the Legislature to renew his control of New York Citys schools were thrown into doubt on Thursday, when the leader of the State Senate issued a statement harshly criticizing Mr. de Blasios performance at a hearing on the issue.Too often, the mayor showed a disturbing lack of personal knowledge about the city schools, the Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, said in a statement. In addition, he has left too many unanswered questions and failed to provide specifics on many of the issues raised by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.Until that occurs, Mr. Flanagan added, I will not entrust this mayor with the awesome responsibility of operating the New York City school system.The animus between Mr. Flanagan and Mr. de Blasio is not new. The mayor is the subject of a multipronged investigation by state and federal authorities over an unsuccessful effort in 2014 to oust Senate Republicans from power. Last year, when Mr. de Blasio went to Albany seeking renewal of mayoral control of schools, originally granted to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2002, Mr. Flanagan made sure he received only a one-year extension.Still, Mr. Flanagans statement had the feeling of a sneak attack. On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio appeared before members of the Senate in Albany to argue for a seven-year extension of mayoral control. Mr. Flanagan did not attend the hearing, and the questioning was relatively mild, although one Republican senator, Terrence P. Murphy, asked why, given the multiple investigations Mr. de Blasios administration is facing, he should trust the mayor to run the citys schools.In an exchange that may have given Mr. Flanagan his opening, another Senate Republican, John DeFrancisco, asked the mayor about the back pay being given to the citys teachers under the most recent contract. Mr. de Blasio did not know the answer to the question, although it was a simple one, which prompted Mr. DeFrancisco to respond with derision.On Thursday, a spokesman for the mayor, Austin Finan, did not respond directly to Mr. Flanagans criticism, saying the mayor and the schools chancellor, Carmen Faria, articulated a clear and compelling case for the state to grant a multiyear extension of mayoral control.From pre-K for all to graduation rates above 70 percent, Mr. Finan continued, the successes of a school system with direct, mayoral accountability cannot be denied.A second hearing is scheduled for May 19 in New York City."}

The partys chairman asked all candidates to sign a unity pledge promising to support the eventual nominee. But by the end of the brutal nominating contest, all of the three remaining candidates broke that pledge.Mr. Trump boasted about the increase in voter participation in the primaries.

How dangerous are they, and should young people have access to them?Should e-cigarettes be banned for young people under the age of 18, or even 21?Sabrina Tavernise reports on how the Food and Drug Administration has issued tighter rules that for the first time will extend federal regulatory authority to e-cigarettes:The Food and Drug Administration made final sweeping new rules that for the first time extend federal regulatory authority to e-cigarettes, popular nicotine delivery devices that have grown into a multibillion-dollar business with virtually no federal oversight or protections for American consumers.The 499-page regulatory road map has broad implications for public health, the tobacco industry and the nations 40 million smokers. The new regulations would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to Americans under 18 and would require that people buying them show photo identification to prove their age, measures already mandated in a number of states. The rules also impose regulations on cigars.The regulations, which will take effect in 90 days, establish oversight of what has been a market free-for-all of products, including vials of liquid nicotine of varying quality and unknown provenance. Producing them has taken years. They stem from a major tobacco-control law Congress passed in 2009. They were first proposed in draft form in 2014.The process has started, and it has been incredibly difficult, said Matthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a health advocacy group. This gives the F.D.A. the authority right away to prohibit some of the most outrageous marketing claims. It imposes nationwide rules that makes it illegal to sell to kids under 18 with real enforcement authority.Ms. Tavernise also recently reported that e-cigarette use by teenagers in the United States rose last year.E-cigarette use continued to rise among young teenagers and preteens in the United States last year, according to new federal data, but cigarette smoking overall did not increase, suggesting that, at least so far, fears that the devices would hook a new generation on traditional cigarettes have not come to pass.Experts said it was too soon to answer the essential question about e-cigarettes: Will they cause more or fewer people to smoke? But the broad trend in youth cigarette smoking has been down in recent years, and researchers have been taking note of that.We do not have any strong evidence that it is encouraging smoking among kids but neither do we have good evidence that it wont over time, said Kenneth E. Warner, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan.The article continues:Young people are a particularly vulnerable bunch, and many public health experts agree that with so little known about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, the fact that so many youths have started using them is worrying, even if they do not use them as a bridge to traditional cigarettes. Others argue that even nicotine can be harmful. In all, about three million middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in 2015, the data showed, up from 2.46 million in 2014.No form of youth tobacco use is safe, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C. in a statement. Nicotine is an addictive drug and use during adolescence may cause lasting harm to brain development.Students: Read both articles, then tell us: Should e-cigarettes be banned for young people? What should be the minimum age required to buy e-cigarettes? Do you or your friends ever smoke either traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes? Are e-cigarettes growing in popularity among young people in your community? Why do you think teenagers decide to start smoking, either traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes? Because e-cigarettes are such a new product, research on them is still in its early stages, and there are many questions that scientists dont know the answers to. Will they cause more or fewer people to smoke traditional cigarettes? Will the nicotine and chemicals in e-cigarettes prove to be harmful, especially to adolescents developing brains? Based on what you have read or seen, do you think that e-cigarettes are unhealthy or dangerous, especially for teenagers? Why do you think that?

{"text": "For years, it has often seemed that those most passionately pressing for a rapid transition from still-abundant fossil fuels to non-polluting energy sources have been as focused on attacking each others arguments as they have on fighting powerful interests defending the status quo (as well as perhaps the biggest foe  inertia, both in society and infrastructure). The result has often felt like a three-legged race  or worse.So it felt like a fresh spring breeze to see constructive discussion sparked by Fighting Climate Change With Innovation, a Foreign Affairs essay proposing a public-private mix of clean-energy investments, policies and incentives aimed at overcoming technological hurdles and accelerating deployment. The piece was written byVarun Sivaramof the Council on Foreign Relations andTeryn Norris, a young analyst (featured here before) who was most recently working for the Department of Energy.Sivaram just wrote a post on the Council on Foreign Relationss Energy, Security, and Climate blog responding to and exploring the reactions to the essay. His piece is reposted below with permission, followed by some overarching thoughts from me.Beyond Climate Confusion: Why Both Energy Innovation and Deployment Matter\n\nBy Varun SivaramI have a new essay in the May/June issue ofForeign AffairsThe Clean Energy Revolution: Fighting Climate Change with Innovationwhich I co-authored with Teryn Norris, a former advisor at the Department of Energy (DOE). We are grateful for the positive and constructive comments weve received, but I do want to respond to apairof criticalpostsby Joseph Romm, formerly an acting Assistant Secretary at the DOE under President Clinton. I hope we can put to rest an unhelpful debate among those passionate about confronting climate change, or, at the very least, respectfully agree to disagree.First, heres some of the positive coverage of our essay. Bill Gates called it One of the best arguments Ive read for why the U.S. should invest in an energy revolution. A visionary who plans to double his personal investment in clean energy technology ventures to $2 billion over the next five years, Mr. Gates is reinvigorating the sector, and were honored by his endorsement.One of the best arguments Ive read for why the U.S. should invest in an energy revolution: https://t.co/58978QoWeY https://t.co/xJV5Dm8hSp Bill Gates (@BillGates) 20 Apr 16Gernot Wagner, a senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and author of Climate Shock, called it clean energy revolution, walk-and-chew edition: price carbon, *and* innovate. On the other side of the aisle, Rich Powell, Managing Director at the conservative ClearPath Foundation, called it the best summary of our clean energy innovation challenge Ive read.Finally, David Roberts at Vox also wrote an article about our essay, remarking, Heres a sign of a more constructive debate on clean energy innovation. I was gratified he recognized our intent to embrace intelligent policies that advance both innovation in and deployment of clean energy technologies without forcing unnecessary either-or choices.[1]He quoted our essays thesis:Fighting climate change successfully will certainly require sensible government policies to level the economic playing field between clean and dirty energy, such as putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. But it will also require policies that encourage investment in new clean energy technology, which even a level playing field may not generate on its own.We set out to write an inclusive essay, and we sincerely appreciate that most readers recognized that. Unfortunately, Dr. Romm chose to interpret our essay as a one-sided argument for innovation at the expense of deployment. That characterization is neither accurate nor constructive, as Ill demonstrate.\n\nOf Red Herrings and Straw MenThe first critical post runs over 4,000 words, under the headline, We Fact-Checked A High-Profile Article On Climate And Energy. It Wasnt Pretty.[2] The post boils down to three central contentions: We have made a factual error by asserting, If the world is to avoid climate calamity, it needs to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 percent by the middle of this centurya target that is simply out of reach with existing technology. It is impossible to achieve deep reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by mid-century using mysterious nonexistent technology. Existing clean energy technologies have fallen in cost and will continue to do so as a function of their deployment, which implies that they are sufficient to achieve ambitious climate goals.It should be clear that only the first contention is amenable to straightforward fact-checking. So the title is a red herring that does not reflect the bulk of the posts discussion, which invites complex, rather than yes/no, answers.We answered the factual question immediately after Dr. Romm published his post. Climate models suggest that global GHG emissions must fall by 7590 percent by 2050, compared with 2010 levels, to provide the best chance of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is a warming level above which scientific uncertainty about the effects of climate change increases substantially. As a result, the Paris Agreement reflects an aspiration to meet this target. Dr. Romm did not contest this fact. We do concede, however, that we could have been clearer in explaining the context behind the 80 percent GHG reduction figure. Still, whether the required reduction is 60 percent (to limit warming to two degrees) or 80 percent by 2050, improved technology can accelerate progress toward either of the targets. And the emissions reduction challenge will not end in 2050, another reason why it is crucial to make long-term investments in innovation today.The second contention suffers from another logical fallacy: it sets up our essays argument for supporting innovative technologies as a straw man argument favoring mysterious nonexistent technology. I am genuinely surprised by this contention, especially because of its author. Dr. Romm and I are both trained physicists. And my experience in the lab, working with some of the best scientists in the world on a revolutionary solar energy technology, proved to me that the breakthroughs we need are within reach. The technologies we need to develop are neither mysterious nor nonexistentscience and technology enable us to probe materials at the nanoscale and simulate novel ideas on supercomputers. And, as Dr. Romm and I both know, the academic literature brims with sanguine reports that do just that.Concretely, in our essay we propose several clean energy technologies that the world needs to achieve deep decarbonization. We write:New reactor designs could make nuclear meltdowns physically impossible, and nanoengineered membranes could block carbon emissions in fossil-fueled power plants. Solar coatings as cheap as wallpaper could enable buildings to generate more power than they consume. And advanced storage technologiesfrom energy-dense batteries to catalysts that harness sunlight to split water and create hydrogen fuelcould stabilize grids and power vehicles. The wish list goes on: new ways to tap previously inaccessible reservoirs of geothermal energy, biofuels that dont compete with food crops, and ultra-efficient equipment to heat and cool buildings. Every one of those advances is possible, but most need a fundamental breakthrough in the lab or a first-of-its-kind demonstration project in the field.For example, there are several candidate chemistries for an energy-dense battery that could power long-range, inexpensive electric vehicles (DOEs Quadrennial Technology Review names lithium-sulfur, magnesium-ion, zinc-air, and lithium-air), but further lab science is needed to develop these technologies. And whereas solar perovskites have excelled in lab efficiency tests, they still need real-world experience to persuade investors and customers to trust the product.None of these technologies are mysterious or non-existent, but they will require resources and time to achieve commercial entry and displace fossil fuels. Dr. Romm argues that the pace of previous energy transitions and the colossal amounts of capital required for such a transition preclude next-generation technologies from playing a major role before 2050.I disagree. That Dr. Romm can point to a particular example of a slow technology development cycle (he references thorium-based nuclear power) should not entail inductive license to dismiss every other technology out of hand. At the 2015 Paris summit, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz provided a compelling vision for nuclear technology development:If we have a viable pathway at building nuclear power in smaller bites, the whole financing structure can change and make it much more affordableIf we can demonstrate lets say the first modular reactor in the early part of the next decade, then what we hope is its part of the planning process in the middle of the next decade for our utilities. Around 2030 the 60-year lifetime of existing reactors will start to kick in, and thats a time period when utility commitments to a new round of nuclear will be especially important If a couple of [the more than 50 privately funded companies developing advanced nuclear technologies] make it its a big deal.And even though there may not be a good precedent for a rapid transition in the energy sector, there are other infrastructure sectors that have been transformed rapidly by innovation. Consider fiber optic networks, which compose a massive global infrastructure system. Over the last four decades, the information capacity of these networks has increased by a factor of roughly ten million. Real scientific breakthroughs and the deployment of innovative technologies made this possible (for more on the science, see this article on Kecks Law).Partnering Innovation with DeploymentDr. Romms third contention is actually one on which we share substantial common ground. We should celebrate the fall in the costs of several clean energy technologies as a function of their cumulative production (the experience effect). But I do disagree with Dr. Romms extrapolation that existing technologies will suffice to meet the climate challenge. Still, I think that their deployment plays an important role in paving the way for superior technologies to succeed them.Deployment can lead to financial and business model innovation, as we see with residential solar leases in the United States or rural microgrid ventures in India and East Africa. Similarly, governments can hone policies through the experience of deployment, like the streamlined renewable energy permitting, inspection, and interconnection regimes in Germany. Utilities learn how to manage grids that overflow with intermittent power. Investors learn how to finance large projects that deliver steady cash flows but are unfamiliar to most investors. And innovative companies look for viable deployment pathways to ensure that their investments in technology development can pay off. Todays technologies alone wont actually power tomorrows world. But they could make it possible for advanced successors to do so.There are clear limits to the potential for existing technologies to meet climate targets. For example, the International Energy Agency warns, Carbon capture and storage (CCS) remains a vital technology to meet long-term global climate goals for emissions reductionTo reduce the cost gap and stimulate innovation, increased policy action is needed to create more market opportunities in parallel with continued research and development (R&D). As emerging economies like India invariably build more fossil-fuel generators, cost-effective CCS technology will indeed be essential.Early CCS deployment efforts have experienced setbacks, such as construction delays and cost overruns (cf. Southern Companys Kemper Project), but the deployment process will yield valuable insights into how to better budget, plan, and implement large CCS retrofit projects in the future. Still, the technology used in current-generation CCS projects to capture CO2, amine absorption, is inadequate for a widely deployable solution to decarbonizing the worlds fossil-fueled power plants. Instead, membrane separation and metal-organic framework capture technologies, which are showing promise in the lab, could meet the performance criteria for a scalable CCS solution.[3]Dr. Romms argument is more convincing with respect to solar energy, which has become increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources as a result of rapid deployment.Harvard Professor David Keith recently predicted that solars dramatic price declines may obviate the need for technology improvements. I think the jury is still out, but we have good reasons to expect that technology improvements will be necessary for solar power to become truly mainstream by mid-century, as GTM Research director Shayle Kann and I wrote in Nature Energy last month. Still, I will be pleasantly surprised if I am proven wrong. Indeed, just this week, a Saudi-backed consortium placed an astonishingly low bid to build a solar farm in Dubai for only 3/kWh, half the local price of power from natural gas. Existing technologies may surprise us, as Dr. Romm suggests, especially if this bid turns into a contract and Dubais prices can be replicated elsewhere in the world. (I am skeptical, though, of the latter possibility).[4]Deployment and innovation go hand in hand. Sometimes, policies that encourage deployment can discourage innovation. I contend, for example, that some solar deployment policies create ring-fenced markets in which mature technologies can lock out emerging competitors through incumbency advantages. But in most cases, public and private resources for deployment do not come at the expense of resources for innovation. And by holistically designing policies that support both emerging technologies as well as mature ones, as we argue in our essay, policymakers can most cost-effectively confront climate change. We assert that a price on carbon, in conjunction with increased support for research, development, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies, can best coordinate innovation with deployment.I hope this resonates with anyone committed to the cause of combating climate change. I invite Dr. Romm and others who might disagree with me to engage in civil discoursewe have a lot to learn from each other. And if we find we have irreconcilable differences, I will be more than happy to respectfully agree todisagree.~~\n[1] I also want to thank CFRs Michael Levi and Andy Revkin at the New York Times for helping me understand the importance of an inclusive approach to climate change mitigation that embraces both innovation and deployment.[2] Dr. Romms second post references the disagreements with our essay previously set out in his first post. But the second one focuses on Bill Gates and makes a third logical fallacyan inappropriate ad hominem attack: Gates, however, appears to be someone who doesnt really listen to the advice of experts. This afflictioncommon to billionaires (Im looking at you Donald Trump)shines through from the very beginning of this interview [with the magazine, Technology Review].[3] I thank Mengyao Yuan at Stanford University for technical guidance on CCS research.[4] Developers building projects at Dubais Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park enjoy a lower cost of capital than any counterpart around the world. Equity has historically been cheap because the Dubai Electricity and Water Agency (DEWA) takes a majority equity stake; debt is also cheap because of sovereign guarantees, for example from the Saudi government. And DEWA has set up the solar park to minimize regulatory and installation costs for developers.My ReflectionsIts clear that practical paths toward addressing consequential but complex issues can only emerge through sustained dialogue, probing for common ground amid divergence, aiming to identify when a disagreement is the result of differing values or risk perceptions rather than flawed analysis. Lately, Ive been championing a model for resolving tough fights over scientific methods employed at the John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis in Colorado. A recent EOS essay by participants and managers beautifully describes how this works, in the context of a seismological tussle over how to improve earthquake threats.Im still working on developing a forum, both online and face to face, called Room for Agreement, that could build on the Powell Centers success and also use the techniques of a master mediator like the departed Ted Kheel to help clarify whats actually in dispute.Keep it up, Varun and Teryn.Its a long climate and energy march.In the meantime, I prompted a rich discussion on the deployment/innovation question at the Our Energy Policy website.* Heres how I framed the question:In todays political world of binary debates, is there a way to get traction simultaneously on both deployment of todays clean tech where it makes the most sense and on greatly boosting spending on fundamental science related to energy systems?You can read the answers here.As Sivaram wrote, there will be instances where champions of different energy paths will have to agree to disagree. Stepping back from the strategic and competitive fights among clean-energy camps, and among the countries that have signed on to the Paris climate agreement, I still see merit in the idea that this diversity, including the tension, is fundamentally in humanitys best interests.Ive explained my thinking in two slides that build on an important 2003 study of ecosystem resilience. Have a look here:Response Diversity Builds Resilience in Ecosystems  Society, Too?In working to boost energy access while limiting global warming, #ResponseDiversity is vital. But is it tolerable? https://t.co/cbC5MiNmQQ Andy Revkin (@Revkin) 6 May 16Im exploring this idea with a variety of social scientists. Im not sure its a testable hypothesis. But it is clearly the human way, whether we like it or not.Disclosure note | I signed on this year as a topic director, one of a batch of energy wonks (I dont see that as a pejorative label).

{"text": "In ancient times, scribes churned out documents  love poems, prayers, lawsuits  for clients who were illiterate or too busy to write. Although reams of the texts survive on papyrus, bark and parchment, the ingredients of the inks remain a mystery. Scientists, archaeologists, curators, historians and conservators are collaborating on testing these writings and crumbs of ancient pigments to unlock the ink recipes.At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the conservator Yana van Dyke has been creating experimental inks from plant extracts, including oak galls, or swollen tissue on oak trees infested by wasps, to compare with those used on manuscripts. Hilary Becker, an assistant classics professor at the University of Mississippi who plans to join the faculty at Binghamton University in New York this fall, is completing a book titled Commerce in Color, about the ancient Roman pigment trade.The Ancient Ink Laboratory, a collaboration between Columbia University and New York University, is using nondestructive techniques like micro Raman spectroscopy, microscopy and infrared photography to scrutinize inks on documents. The lab is also studying fermentation residues from winemaking that may have gone into ancient ink mixtures and crusts found inside ancient inkwells at the University of Michigans Kelsey Museum of Archaeology.In poring over Roman texts, Ms. Becker has found references to indelible and invisible inks on the market, some of them highly valued, and complaints about adulterated ingredients and poor quality. In the fifth century, Roman law mandated that only emperors could write with prized purple ink made from charred seashells, for example. Anyone else who obtained this expensive dye would face the death penalty.David Ratzan, the head librarian at N.Y.U.s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, said that no one is certain how soot and other charred ingredients in black inks were made and harvested. Pliny the Elder mentions that the best kind of black pigment is adulterated with the soot from furnaces and baths, which is used for writing.All this new scholarship could be useful for experts authenticating manuscripts and for conservators trying to stabilize documents damaged by corrosive inks. Extracts in the formulas may also indicate where tree species once flourished and help identify the trade routes for ink products.Its all part of a puzzle, Ms. van Dyke said.From the 1880s to the 1910s, the painter J. Alden Weir vacationed with fellow intellectuals in a sleepy corner of eastern Connecticut. At his home there in Windham, he sketched meadows bordered by picturesquely sagging fences and encroaching railroad lines and textile mills; his visitors included John Singer Sargent and Childe Hassam. Anne E. Dawson, an art history professor at Eastern Connecticut State University, has spent seven years tracking down documents and artworks for A Good Summers Work: J. Alden Weir, Connecticut Impressionist, opening on Saturday at the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London, Conn., and a book, Rare Light: J. Alden Weir in Windham, Connecticut, 1882-1919, from Wesleyan University Press.The Windham artists colony has largely been forgotten, unlike some of its counterparts along the Connecticut coast and in the New York suburbs. Mr. Weirs other family home, in Wilton, Conn., is now the Weir Farm National Historic Site, and studio spaces there are still stocked with brushes, palettes and paints. In Windham, he worked in a converted shoe factory that has since been demolished; its weeded-over remains are not far from the Weir familys graves. His paintings of the area have often been mislabeled as scenes of the countryside around Wilton.Ms. Dawson analyzed Mr. Weirs correspondence as well as family inventories. The artist sometimes adapted his natural surroundings in Windham to improve his compositions on canvas, shifting hill contours and adding hollyhocks and other plants. He called the technique hollyhocking.On May 20 and 21, Boyd Auctions in Portsmouth, N.H., will offer antiques passed down to Mr. Weirs descendants, including art supplies, paintings, letters and family photographs. Ms. Dawson said that she would document the material before it is dispersed.Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, a father-and-son team of Bohemian-born glassmakers based in Dresden, Germany, were known for bending wisps of glass into detailed models of flowers and marine life. In the late 1800s they supplied displays for schools, museums and aquariums while also making prosthetic glass eyes and lab equipment for export. After a few decades on view, the botanical and zoological pieces were often considered outdated; countless items ended up in storerooms, their petals shattered and tentacles snapped.In recent months experts have been restoring the Blaschkas glass minutiae in preparation for Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, an exhibition opening on May 14 at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y. It will explore the Blaschkas methods of reinforcing models with wires and glue, the their shipping crates and the surviving glass creations worldwide. Videos will show conservators repairing the antiques, many of which belong to Cornell University.The curator of the Cornell holdings, Drew Harvell, a marine biologist, researched the contemporary fates of the creatures that were immortalized in glass for her recent climate-change-related book, A Sea of Glass: Searching for the Blaschkas Fragile Legacy in an Ocean at Risk (University of California Press). She collaborated with the filmmaker David O. Brown on a documentary about the subject, Fragile Legacy, and the teams footage of marine life depicted by the Blaschkas will be screened at the Corning Museum.An exhibition of the photographer Guido Mocaficos close-ups of Blaschka sculptures runs through May 24 at Hamiltons Gallery in London. Harvards Blaschka  collections are the subject of a book due this fall, Sea Creatures in Glass: The Blaschka Marine Animals at Harvard (Harvard Museums/Scala), and a renovated display that reopens there on May 21."}
{"text": "ISTANBUL  In pursuit of more power, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has purged the judiciary of enemies, jailed journalists and crushed anti-government protests. Now, he has ousted his closest political ally, the countrys prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, whose modest effort to check Mr. Erdogans ambition was too much for the president.Mr. Davutoglu, publicly loyal to Mr. Erdogan even as he pushed back privately on some of his excesses, said Thursday that he would step aside as the leader of the Islamist Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., and give up his position as prime minister.Clearly shaken, but a loyal party soldier to the end, Mr. Davutoglu described his relationship with Mr. Erdogan as brotherly.You will never hear me say negative things about our president, he said Thursday, his voice quavering. My loyalty to him will last until the end.Mr. Davutoglus resignation exposed a rift between the two men over Mr. Erdogans moves to expand his power. Their split signals that Mr. Erdogans transformation from democrat to autocrat is nearly complete, his ambition of establishing an executive presidency closer at hand.As an Islamist leader who presided over a growing economy and seemed serious about advancing democracy in Turkey, Mr. Erdogan was embraced by the West when he came to power in 2003. A dazzling and charismatic reformer, he seemed to embody the promise that Islam and democracy could coexist.In recent years, critics have argued that Mr. Erdogan never intended to become a liberal leader, citing an old quote attributed to him that democracy is like a bus, when you arrive at your destination, you step off.Mr. Erdogan has tried to silence his critics, sometimes with comical effects, and is seeking to change the Constitution to establish a more powerful presidency and solidify his status as the pre-eminent political figure in Turkey.The ouster of Mr. Davutoglu offered another vivid example of Mr. Erdogans autocratic style and his mastery of power politics that Turks this week likened to characters from The Godfather or House of Cards.Mr. Erdogan is often compared to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his authoritarian style and his ability to keep winning elections while eroding the quality of Turkeys democratic institutions. Mr. Erdogan burnished that image when he switched from prime minister to president, something Mr. Putin had done to preserve his political supremacy.Mr. Davutoglu, long seen as subservient to Mr. Erdogan, was often compared to Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Putins loyal deputy. But Mr. Medvedev has stuck around and Mr. Davutoglu is out.Mr. Erdogan doesnt even want someone like Davutoglu, who was pretty much singing his tune, with some nuances, said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker with the A.K.P. and the chairman of the Center For Strategic Communication in Ankara. Step by step, hes making sure his political objective, which is the presidential system, is achieved.The resignation of Mr. Davutoglu follows one of his greatest successes as prime minister: a deal with the European Union to stem the flow of refugees from Turkey to the Continent.Mr. Davutoglu, not Mr. Erdogan, was front and center in those negotiations, and the international attention he received angered Mr. Erdogan, analysts said. Mr. Davutoglu also sought a meeting with President Obama, according to Turkish news media reports, and though the meeting did not transpire, the analysts said it nevertheless raised the ire of Mr. Erdogan.Erdogan has been deeply suspicious of Davutoglus attempts to gain international credibility through his dealings with the European Union and attempts to meet with Obama, said Aykan Erdemir, a former opposition lawmaker with Turkeys main secular party who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.As part of the refugee deal, the European Union agreed to visa-free travel for Turks to parts of Europe and to speed up Turkeys long-stalled negotiations to join the bloc. With Mr. Davutoglu out, that process is further in doubt.In public, Mr. Davutoglu has largely been deferential to Mr. Erdogan. He was praising him and glorifying him, said Mr. Kiniklioglu, the former lawmaker.But Mr. Davutoglu was known to be less enthusiastic than Mr. Erdogan in pushing for a presidential system, something that would have eliminated any remaining authority in the office of prime minister, which under Turkeys Constitution is the most powerful position.There is no major ideological divide between the two, said Omer Taspinar, an expert on Turkey at the Brookings Institution. Its a power struggle, with Erdogan pushing for total loyalty and full support for his presidential agenda and Davutoglu showing slight resistance in order to keep checks and balances to protect his role as prime minister.While his public comments indicated little distance between him and Mr. Erdogan, there were signs lately that Mr. Davutoglu was trying to assert himself and, at least modestly, challenge Mr. Erdogans authority.The basic problem is that Erdogan seeks to eliminate anyone in the party who has any ambitions of authority of their own, said Svante E. Cornell, a Turkey analyst with the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, a research organization.The split between Turkeys top two political leaders added another element of turmoil at a time when the country is facing numerous challenges: a war in the southeast against Kurdish militants; spillover from the war in Syria, with cross-border shelling; and the arrival of millions of refugees.Mr. Davutoglu had been the chief architect of Turkeys Syria policy, which is widely viewed as a failure.For years, Turkey allowed its southern border with Syria to be an easy conduit for weapons and fighters, a policy criticized by the United States and other allies for allowing the rise of the Islamic State. The refugee crisis shows no signs of abating, and Syrias president, Bashar al-Assad, remains firmly in power, backed by Russia and Iran.Analysts say Mr. Davutoglu will most likely be cast as the scapegoat for Turkeys Syria policy by Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle.The country also endured a period of political instability last year, after the A.K.P. lost its parliamentary majority before regaining control in a snap election. During this period, Turkish stocks fell and the Turkish lira lost value against the dollar, reflecting investors concerns about Mr. Erdogans unchecked power.Mr. Kiniklioglu said that Mr. Davutoglus assertiveness on international issues very likely raised concerns among Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle that the prime minister was slowly trying to exercise his own authority.Referring to Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Kiniklioglu said, He just wants someone who sits quietly in Ankara until the executive presidency is in place.Mr. Davutoglu said he would step aside after a special party congress to choose a new leader to be held on May 22.Mr. Erdogan, who as president is supposed to be above party politics, is expected to help choose a successor to his former acolyte who will be subservient and lead his effort to rewrite the Constitution and establish a presidential system. That would most likely require new elections for the A.K.P. to gain more seats in Parliament to approve any constitutional changes.Mr. Davutoglu, a bookish and professorial counterweight to the brash and abrasive Mr. Erdogan, agreed in 2014 to be prime minister when Mr. Erdogan was elected president. Other top A.K.P. officials had demurred, fearing that they would have no authority under Mr. Erdogan.Analysts say Mr. Erdogan, given his power and his vast popularity among Turkeys pious masses, is unlikely to face much political cost in removing Mr. Davutoglu."}

Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)Long Days Journey Into Night In Jonathan Kents stately and static revival of Eugene ONeills masterwork, the powerhouse team of Gabriel Byrne, Jessica Lange, Michael Shannon and John Gallagher Jr. is acting up a storm, for sure. Yet its hard to avoid the feeling that this tempestuous climate is artificially controlled. The standout: Mr. Byrnes fine-grained portrait of a hope-stripped father (3:40). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)On Your Feet! This latest jukebox musical to plug in to Broadways power strip tells the story of Gloria and Emilio Estefans rise to pop-chart success with crowd-pleasing flair and plenty of itchy-feet-making dance music. The vibrant Ana Villafae and Josh Segarra star as the Cuban-born Estefans (2:20). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, 877-250-2929, onyourfeetmusical.com. (Isherwood) School of Rock: The Musical Andrew Lloyd Webbers friskiest show in decades. Based on the 2003 movie, this story of a rock n roll nerd (played by Alex Brightman, a bouncing Super Ball of energy) who teaches a class of regimented fifth-graders (a fabulous band of preadolescents) to stick it to the man is as amiably easygoing as it is loud (2:20). Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, schoolofrockthemusical.com, 212-239-6200. (Brantley) She Loves Me Scott Elliss rapturous revival of this 1963 musical about love at the workplace in old Budapest is a reminder of the pleasures of exalted ordinariness. Embodied by an expertly attuned cast that includes Zachary Levi, Jane Krakowski and a honey-throated Laura Benanti, this sumptuously produced work has a lingering and deeply satisfying sweetness usually lacking in brassier shows (2:20). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-239-6200, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley) Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed George C. Wolfes reimagining of this all-black musical from 1921 often feels as if its been written according to a checklist of essential historical and editorial points to be made. But the clunky exposition doesnt overwhelm the sweeping grace of its vintage musical numbers, vibrantly choreographed by Savion Glover, or Audra MacDonalds robust, witty turn as a Jazz Age chanteuse (2:40). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, shufflealongbroadway.com. (Brantley) Tuck Everlasting A refreshingly small-scale family musical based on the popular childrens book by Natalie Babbitt. Sarah Charles Lewis plays the lonely Winnie, who in 19th-century New Hampshire meets a mysterious boy, Jesse (Andrew Keenan-Bolger) and discovers his familys strange secret. The book, by Claudia Shear and Tim Federle, and the score, by Chris Miller and Nathan Tysen, are both nicely turned; and Casey Nicholaws climactic ballet is a knockout (2:15). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, tuckeverlastingmusical.com. (Isherwood)Waitress A thrilling performance by Jessie Mueller (Beautiful: The Carole King Musical) brings some much-needed depth of feeling to this slick but superficial musical based on the movie about a pie-baking diner worker in distress. The score, by the pop singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, is also beguiling, but Diane Pauluss production flattens the ancillary characters into cartoons (2:35).

(Isherwood)Cagney When the hero of Robert Creighton, Christopher McGovern and Peter Colleys Hollywood musical shows his stuff as a tap dancer, you may want to buy war bonds.

(Anita Gates)Daddy Long Legs This sweet, beautifully sung and only occasionally unsettling musical adaptation of Jean Websters 1912 novel is predicated on the lengthy correspondence between a pert orphan and her anonymous benefactor. Even if the relationship between the adorable Jerusha and the debonair Jervis reads as at least a little creepy, their voices twine charmingly (2:15).

(Soloski) Dear Evan Hansen As a lonely high schooler, Ben Platt gives a heartbreaker of a performance as the title character in this terrific musical, with a clever book by Steven Levenson and nifty songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Michael Greifs direction and a flawless cast add to the pleasure (2:30). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, 212-246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)The Dingdong Occasionally hilarious and mostly harmless, Mark Shanahans adaptation of Georges Feydeaus farce, produced by the Peal Theater Company, centers on a wife who wont commit adultery unless her husband strays first. Under Hal Brookss direction, the pacing comes and goes, though with all the frothy lingerie and funny accents, however, you might not notice (2:00). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, 212-563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Soloski) Drunk Shakespeare Probably youve seen streamlined, amped-up productions of Shakespeare before, but the gimmick here is that as the performance of Macbeth begins, one of the actors downs a mind-fogging number of shots. What follows is a wild mash-up of Shakespeare and pop-culture references that seems chaotically improvised but takes a deceptive amount of skill to execute. The audience sits right up against the action and sometimes gets drawn into it (1:30). The Lounge, Roy Arias Stages, 300 West 43rd Street, fourth floor, drunkshakespeare.com. (Neil Genzlinger) The Effect The irreducibility of love is the subject of Lucy Prebbles very clever  and ultimately more than clever  play about a couple who meet as guinea pigs for a clinical trial for an antidepressant. David Cromers deeply empathic production  and Susannah Flood and Carter Hudsons intense central performance  remind us that in exciting theater, feeling trumps science (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com. (Brantley)Full House! The Musical! This frenetic, ribald and exhausting satire from the creators of Bayside! The Musical! barely stops for breath. Only Marshall Louise freezes time with her delicious sendup of the grown Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Her impersonation may be one-note, but it is something to treasure (2:00).

(Andy Webster)Idiot A response to Dostoyevskys novel The Idiot, Robert Lyons and Kristin Martings immersive show zeros in on four characters, with Daniel Kublick exuding a sweet otherness in the title role. Something crucial is missing, though, from this sleekly designed production. The action feels uprooted from its original soil but not yet firmly planted in a new one (1:15).

(Laura Collins-Hughes)Kentucky Leah Nanako Winklers comedy-drama is a riff on the family play, the homecoming play, the coming-of-age play and also occasionally a musical. If the script is overstuffed and the tone frenetic, it is also the full-length debut of a distinctive new voice  mouthy, sly and bourbon-sweet, with the expected kick (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, 866-811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Soloski)One Funny Mother In this solo show, Dena Blizzard jokes about her children and her husband, but she never really makes her household anything other than a generic one. There are plenty of laughs but no overarching theme or point. Its a show aimed at parents, especially young mothers, who want to foster the idea that raising children is an impossibly demanding task (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, 212-239-6200, onefunnymother.com. (Genzlinger)The Place We Built In Budapest, as the political climate shifts rightward, a collective of young adults must decide whether to try to save the scruffy cultural space where theyve been reconnecting with their Jewish heritage. But collectives often have a dispersive energy, and, unfortunately, so does this sprawling play by Sarah Gancher, in an immersive production by Danya Taymor (2:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, 866-811-4111, theflea.org. (Collins-Hughes) Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again. Alice Birchs implosive, vitalizing play has a way of making you question everything you say when it comes to discussing 21st-century women in a society that hasnt caught up with them. Directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz, with a cast that revels in acting up and acting out, this production finds the theatrical exhilaration in civil disobedience (1:05).

(Brantley)The Robber Bridegroom The director Alex Timbers brings enlivening wit and a macabre picturesqueness to this rowdy bluegrass adaptation from the 1970s of Eudora Weltys fairy-tale novella of old Mississippi. Featuring a book by Alfred Uhry and music by Robert Waldman, the show suggests a boisterous singing hayride, with lots of exuberant twanging. Steven Pasquale is the dreamy renegade hero (1:30).

This spiked Shirley Temple of a show, which first opened in 1992 and now returns with less fizz, follows the adventures of Tina Denmark (Tori Murray), a stage-struck prepubescent with occasional homicidal tendencies.

(Soloski)Shear Madness This astonishingly durable interactive murder mystery has been running in Boston since Jimmy Carter was in the White House, and some of the jokes in the late-arriving New York incarnation definitely show their years. But the tone of this improv-heavy play depends hugely on the performers. They lend an inclusive spirit of fun to the proceedings, set in a Manhattan hair salon where the audience determines which character is the most likely suspect (2:00).

(Brantley) Thank God for Jokes Mike Birbiglia, who had success in 2008 with Sleepwalk With Me, is back with another monologue, and its spectacular. His subject is humor  the structure and purpose of a joke, the rules for when and where to tell one  but this is no lecture. His core anecdote involves an infamous joke he told while hosting an awards ceremony, but its the frequent, elaborate detours that make this show such a delight. By the end, you realize that somehow some thoughtful points have been slipped in while you were laughing nonstop for almost an hour and a half (1:23).

{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO  Brazils Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Eduardo Cunha, the powerful lawmaker who orchestrated the effort to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, must step down because he is facing a corruption trial.The decision added to the political turmoil in Brazil, a country deeply divided over its scandal-plagued leaders. Just this week, Vice President Michel Temer, the man preparing to take over the presidents office from Ms. Rousseff, was ordered to pay a fine for violating campaign financing limits.The twin decisions are not expected to save Ms. Rousseffs presidency. Support for her ouster remains strong in the Senate, which is preparing to vote next week on whether to remove her from office and put her on trial over claims of budgetary manipulation.Still, the decisions tarnish the men in line to take over from her. Despite his conviction, Mr. Temer is still expected to become president if Ms. Rousseff is removed by the Senate. Yet the ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician who may be barred from campaigning ends up running the country.On Thursday, a Supreme Court justice, Teori Zavascki, ruled against Mr. Temers powerful ally, Mr. Cunha. As the speaker of the lower house of Congress who oversaw the vote in April to impeach Ms. Rousseff in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Cunha had adroitly fended off charges of taking as much as $40 million in bribes.Scholars and political analysts described the initial ruling by Justice Zavascki, which the 11-member court later endorsed, as reflecting the capacity for Brazils legal system to curb abuses of power. Joaquim Barbosa, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, called the move extraordinary and courageous.The ruling to remove Mr. Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator, sidelines a top political opponent of Ms. Rousseff after much of his role in impeachment process had been completed. The impeachment decision is now in the hands of the Senate, which is expected to vote against the president on May 11.Mr. Cunha can appeal the ruling against him, and he is expected to do so. A spokesman for Mr. Temer said he would not appeal his conviction and would pay a fine of about $23,000. (Mr. Temer, 75, has already signaled that if he were to become president, he would not run for re-election.)In a statement, Mr. Temers office said that he had exceeded the limit for campaign donations because of a calculation error. Mr. Temers office also said that he would become ineligible to run for office only if another court chose to act on the electoral courts ruling.In the lower house, attention now shifts to Waldir Maranho, an obscure ally of Mr. Cunha poised to take over as speaker. Like Mr. Cunha, Mr. Maranho is under investigation on graft charges, raising the possibility that the Supreme Court could also order him to step down.The legal clouds around Mr. Cunha and Mr. Temer raise concerns over the legitimacy of a possible government led by their centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which recently broke an alliance with Ms. Rousseffs leftist Workers Party to seek her impeachment.The ruling involving Mr. Temer was issued on Tuesday in a case before an electoral court in So Paulo. In that case, prosecutors were trying to increase the fine against him over campaign donations he made in 2014. The court decided against increasing the fine, but it upheld the ruling that Mr. Temer had violated campaign finance laws.While prosecutors have determined that Mr. Temer will not face an investigation over testimony implicating him in the colossal graft scandal engulfing Petrobras, the national oil company, various politicians identified as potential ministers in Mr. Temers cabinet are battling their own corruption cases.The figures under investigation include top allies of Mr. Temer such as Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazils largest government-controlled banks; Romero Juc, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon; and Henrique Alves, a former tourism minister.Mr. Temer said this week that he saw no problem naming such politicians to his cabinet, maintaining that they were innocent until proven guilty.An investigation is just that, only an investigation, Mr. Temer said in nationally televised comments."}
{"text": "Sometimes fashion is art, sometimes it is just stuff to wear. Other times it is mind-boggling craft and exquisite technique whose aesthetic strangeness can render the art question moot.Thats the effect of Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology, the latest of the Metropolitan Museum of Arts annual fashion extravaganzas from its Costume Institute, and one distinguished by a lack of Met Gala-style hoopla. It celebrates the luxury wares of mostly French fashion houses, but brings fresh focus to the convergence of traditional haute couture and high-end ready-to-wear. A new closeness has emerged, partly through a shared reliance on intricate tech-savvy processes. The exhibition is sponsored by Apple  perhaps an improvement over the often-too-cozy patronage of fashion houses  and comes at a time when a few tech companies are edging into fashion with their own athleisure lines.The show is unusually thoughtful  a stately, gorgeous tutorial. Encompassing 170 ensembles and dresses, it examines how haute couture, long associated with impeccably handmade garments tailored to individual clients, is increasingly integrating breakthroughs in technologies and materials. Technology (machina) is not replacing the hand (manus); rather, the two are collaborating as never before, stimulating innovation and expression.This is evidenced by an assortment of dresses, several of them by the imaginative Dutch designer Iris van Herpen, that border on sculpture in their form and lack of function. The often complex joinings of forces are spelled out in labels where various kinds of handwork mingle with references to 3-D printing, laser this and laser that, ultrasonic welding and custom software-rendered patterns.As these extravaganzas go, Manus x Machina is exceptional, its clarity and serenity distinguishing it from quite a few of its predecessors at the Costume Institute. It was organized by Andrew Bolton, who became its head curator in January, with the retirement of the widely respected Harold Koda.Mr. Bolton has always aimed high, often guided by a flair for showmanship. He has risked failure and, at times, been its victim. He was responsible for the finely honed spectacle of the Alexander McQueen retrospective in 2011 and the ambitious but flawed China: Through the Looking Glass last year. But he has also organized exercises in frenetic vacuity like AngloMania, Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy and the overreaching Punk: Chaos to Couture.With Manus x Machina, Mr. Bolton is in fine form: over the top, but with a dignity and restraint more typical of his predecessor, especially in Mr. Kodas last major exhibition, an examination of Charles Jamess wonderfully architectural garments.Mr. Boltons show is structured according to six of the mtiers  or trades  of dressmaking that are as essential to couture today as they were in the mid-18th-century, when Diderots encyclopedia formalized their tools and processes. (The pertinent volumes are on view.)The mtiers here progress from embroidery and featherwork, through artificial flowers, pleating, lace and leatherwork. Mtiers have usually been handled by outside specialists famous in their own right, among them Maison Lesage (embroidery), Maison Sophie Hallette (lace) and Maison Lemari (feather and leatherwork).The show also includes a section titled Tailleur & Flou, or tailoring and dressmaking, the traditional divisions within a couture house. Here youll also find toiles, or muslins  prototypes used in early stages of the design process. Included are both actual muslins and irreverent contemporary garments inspired by them, from designers like Martin Margiela, John Galliano for Dior and Alber Elbaz for Lanvin.Manus x Machina occupies the two-story Robert Lehman Wing  a new location in the Met for Costume Institute shows. It is blissfully low-tech. A few short videos on tiny screens allow glimpses at the designers or artisans at work. The shows only soundtrack is Brian Enos soothing, slightly ecclesiastical An Ending (Ascent), which is almost certain to enhance concentration.So will the exhibitions wonderfully understated gallery treatments conceived by Shohei Shigematsu, who leads the New York office of Rem Koolhaass Office for Metropolitan Architecture, in collaboration with the Mets design department.The clothes are set against white cotton backdrops that sharpen their colors. In addition to lining the walls, this muslinlike fabric is used for scrims that form arched niches and domes, transforming the space into a glowing, abstract cathedral.A false floor has also been built across the Lehmans atrium, creating a central gallery, an interesting precedent that other museums saddled with uninspiring spaces might study.The show opens in this center gallery with the first of several case studies, the term used here for a featured garment whose making is detailed in an extended wall label. This one is a Renaissance-style wedding dress designed in 2014-15 by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. Made from creamy synthetic scuba knit  which holds shape very well  it has a 20-foot train painted and printed with slightly pixelated gold foliate pattern based on a sketch by Mr. Lagerfeld. This pattern is also projected, greatly magnified, on the dome high overhead  a beautiful effect that recurs more modestly with the other case studies.The clothes here arent always the latest thing. They reach back over 100 years, indicating that couture has always kept up with innovations, among them the sewing machine (used to make a Paul Poiret coat in 1919) and machine-made lace (Coco Chanel, in the late 30s).The difference between handmade and machine-made is sometimes hard to discern, sometimes blatant, as in the shows dynamic lace section. Plastic is usually a sign of machine intervention, but even the thatches of common plastic straws  clear and black  in two recent dresses by Gareth Pugh are hand-cut and attached individually. Mr. Pughs garments introduce the featherwork section, where the shocker is a dress by Ms. van Herpen that includes laser-cut silicone feathers and three silicone-dipped gull skulls, while the stunner is a long princess-line evening dress by Raf Simons for Dior that is covered with small (hand-glued) rooster feathers in a rainbow of subtle colors.Different sections unfold like small shows unto themselves, loosely thematic and color-coordinated, full of interesting cross-references. The embroidery section has an aquatic tone; scales are a frequent motif and sequins a recurring material, as signaled by Yves Saint Laurents astounding sardine dress of 1983 (a case study). Blues, greens and silvers dominate this section, and even exceptions are oceanic: a coral-colored gown dotted with coral beads by Givenchy and a tour de force from the Alexander McQueen designer Sarah Burton (2012, ready-to-wear) that looks like solid coral, including numerous branches, but is often pink-dyed shells.Each section also encompasses widely divergent sensibilities. The artificial flowers portion includes Hussein Chalayans metallic gold cast-fiberglass Kaikoku floating dress of 2011-12, a motorized cone on wheels decorated with dozens of little crystals on wings that, prompted by remote control, fly into the air  like pollen, the label says. Across from this cousin of R2-D2 stands another Chanel wedding ensemble case study, this one from 2005-06 and made completely by hand.The garment is a full-length array of silk camellias ranging from buds to large blossoms, trimmed at the neck and wrists in ostrich feathers. Near the sublime lurks the ridiculous: a 1999 wedding ensemble by Saint Laurent that is basically a bikini of artificial roses, and two short dresses from 2009 by McQueen made of painted-metal flower petals that look like crushed bottle caps.The first part of the pleating section is a feast of color that traces the inventive pleats of Mariano Fortuny, Mary McFadden (who figured out how to make Fortunys pleats mechanically) and Issey Miyake. Mr. Miyake is represented by three dresses in bright polyester on mannequins, opposite the same garments laid out flat like shaped paintings, and also by his accordionlike flying saucer dress displayed in three states, flat to fully extended.The extremes of the lively lace section start with an 1870 Irish wedding dress hand-crocheted in cream-color cotton that is abloom with rather legible flowers. At the other end of the spectrum are extraordinary recent excursions into 3-D printing with synthetic polymers by Ms. van Herpen, threeASFOUR and Noa Raviv, whose dresses feature bulky, corsagelike curving forms reminiscent of Frank Gehrys computer-aided designs.Sometimes its more inspiring to see technology used in ways that seem to promise wider use, which Mr. Lagerfeld does in the tailoring section. Next to one of Coco Chanels classic boucl tweed suits from the mid-1960s, Mr. Bolton has installed three new versions by Mr. Lagerfeld. At first you may notice that the fabric is quilted, slyly evoking Chanels little quilted purses with the gold chains, then, that its perforated.This material is actually a finely gridded facsimile of weaving that was designed by Mr. Lagerfeld and 3-D-printed in a polyamide developed by Materialise. A video of models wearing the suits suggests that flexibility is still an issue, and probably expense is too. Still, its not hard to imagine this material as part of everyday life a few years down the road, especially without the gold, Lesage-embroidered sequins visible behind it.Saint Laurent is known to have said: Art is a very big word for couture. Its a mtier like any other, but a poetic mtier. Mr. Bolton quotes these words in his ravishing exhibition, which makes fashion feel bigger without fussing over its artistic status."}

{"text": "James Haughton, a civil rights advocate who aggressively challenged racial barriers to hiring at construction sites in the 1960s and 70s and promoted programs to train black and Hispanic apprentices in the building trades, died on April 17 in Manhattan. He was 86.The cause was a chronic urinary tract infection, his partner, Ronnie Asbell, said.Mr. Haughton, a construction workers son, was best known for breaking with more moderate proponents of equal opportunity in hiring and housing to form what became known in 1969 as Fight Back, a group based in Harlem.Fight Back documented discrimination; staged boycotts, protests and sit-down strikes; and filed lawsuits (sometimes with Columbia Universitys Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law) against contractors and unions that were closed to newcomers, a consequence, the group said, of nepotism and racism.Fight Back also provided counseling and placement services when jobs became available.In 1972, racial minorities made up more than a third of New York Citys population but accounted for only about 2 percent of union members in skilled construction jobs. Today, minorities make up about two-thirds of the citys population and about half the membership of unions affiliated with the Building and Construction Trades Council, the organization says.The construction trades have changed a lot since then, said Michael Merrill, dean of the Harry Van Arsdale Jr. Center for Labor Studies at Empire State College of the State University of New York. Haughton was part of the tide, and he brought visibility and prominence to the issue.Mr. Haughton also lobbied for greater investment by the federal government in housing, both to improve living conditions and to provide employment. Timothy J. Cooney, an assistant city housing administrator, was so impressed with Mr. Haughton, who had been picketing his office in 1967 seeking more minority jobs, that he quit his municipal post and joined Fight Back.He was the first black man Id ever met who had a real feeling for the potential power of a housing public-works program to put black and Puerto Rican people to work, Mr. Cooney told The New Yorker in 1970.James Haughton Jr. was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 8, 1929, the son of West Indian immigrants, James Haughton Sr. and the former Mary Miller. He grew up near the Fort Greene section and graduated from Boys High School and, in 1951, the City College of New York. He served as an Army lieutenant during the Korean War and received a master of public administration degree from New York University in 1960.His wife, Eleanor Burke Leacock, an anthropologist, died in 1987. Besides Ms. Asbell, he is survived by four stepchildren, Elspeth, Claudia, David and Robert Leacock; and six step-grandchildren.After serving in Korea, Mr. Haughton worked as a youth counselor with street gangs in New York and Los Angeles and as an assistant to A. Philip Randolph, the president of what in 1960 was called the Negro American Labor Council. Mr. Haughton left in 1964 and founded the Harlem Unemployment Center, which also dealt with hiring in other industries.In Constructing Affirmative Action: The Struggle for Equal Employment Opportunity (2011), David Hamilton Golland gave credit to Fight Back for increasing the number of skilled blacks employed in the construction of SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, the Harlem State Office Building and the World Trade Center.Mr. Haughtons assertive tactics, in which hundreds of demonstrators were arrested, won concessions from public agencies and private developers on hiring goals and job training, although a number of contractors complained of excessive pressure by some local groups to hire neighborhood residents, as community coordinators or security guards.Mr. Haughton argued that community pressure on contractors is the only way these workers can obtain jobs.The criminality is with the government, for not giving jobs to black and Hispanic workers, he said."}
{"text": "The most repeated story about the career of Alden Ehrenreich, an actor whose name is worth committing to memory now, is a story of discovery, a miracle of luck and circumstance not unlike Lana Turners at the soda fountain.But because Mr. Ehrenreich, 26, is a young Jewish prince of the Palisades and our story begins in the early aughts, the soda fountain is a Los Angeles bat mitzvah and the discoverer is Steven Spielberg.Mr. Ehrenreich is used to retelling the details, he said, though over the years, people have become more and more apologetic about asking for them again.The broad strokes are these: At the age of 13, noodling around with a video camera, he and a friend made a funny video for the bat mitzvah of a friend of a friend. It was a surreal and haphazardly plotted love story, which began in the present and eventually cut to 20 or 30 years later, with Mr. Ehrenreich, in a kimono, screaming to stop a wedding.When we showed it to our parents, they said, You look like a moron, you cant let anyone see this, Mr. Ehrenreich said.He was not even at the bat mitzvah where it was screened, but Mr. Spielberg was. A call from DreamWorks, the studio Mr. Spielberg helped found, and a meeting with its casting director followed.Mr. Ehrenreichs progress has been slower than that overnight-sensation story would suggest.After the video, he spent years auditioning, bagging stray cameos on procedurals and in teen-friendly TV shows. He built himself up by gradual persistence, and though his name is not yet immediately familiar to you, it is to a handful of Hollywood heavyweights: Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen, the Coen Brothers, Warren Beatty.I think youve chosen a good person to be writing about, Mr. Beatty said when a reporter called, citing Mr. Ehrenreichs unusual combination of sensitivity and intelligence and humor. My feeling is that he is going to be a major player in movies.That may happen sooner than later. Mr. Ehrenreich is suddenly being discussed all over Hollywood, as trade papers and gossip columns on both coasts trumpeted this week that he has landed the role of Star Wars Han Solo in the coming Solo standalone movie, scheduled for 2018, rumors of which have circulated for weeks. When asked, Mr. Ehrenreich said he could not say anything about it, though he did cop to being a Star Wars fan. (Who isnt? he said. Star Wars vs. Star Trek? Probably both.) A representative for Disney, which distributes the Star Wars films and owns Lucasfilm, which produces them, declined to comment.Before then  most likely  Mr. Ehrenreich will star in Mr. Beattys long-gestating film about two young strivers who arrive in Hollywood to work for the mogul Howard Hughes. (Mr. Beatty has had it in mind since the 1970s.) In April it was reported that the film would be released this fall, though Mr. Beatty said that a date had not been chosen.Mr. Ehrenreichs rise comes after a few starts that stalled. Tetro, a modest family drama by Mr. Coppola, was warmly received but played at only 16 theaters in the United States at its widest release. Beautiful Creatures, a big-budget supernatural teen romance, fizzled.Then came Joel and Ethan Coens back-lot comedy, Hail, Caesar!, with a star-making turn for Mr. Ehrenreich.Hail, Caesar! is a loving sendup of old Hollywood, a jaunty caper of kidnapping and Communist intrigue set at Capitol Pictures, a fictional studio. Its plot functions mostly as a way to cram a variety of 1950s studio-system genre flicks and scenery-chewing actors into a dizzy pastiche.George Clooney does his best Charlton Heston in Hail, Caesar!, a Ben-Hur-ish film within the film. Scarlett Johansson vamps as an Esther Williams-style mermaid. Channing Tatum tap-dances a homoerotic homage to Gene Kelly.Even in such company, Mr. Ehrenreich stood out. As the cowboy crooner Hobie Doyle, a Western actor shoehorned into a prim drawing-room comedy called Merrily We Dance (another film within the film), he made off with entire scenes.He went nose to nose with Ralph Fiennes in what may be the films most endearing bit of shtick: a painstaking elocution lesson in which a country boy butchers a line (Would that it were so simple!) in attempted mid-Atlantic English.Hail, Caesar!  the Coen brothers film, rather than the Capitol Pictures one  was met with mixed response (though it was a hit with many critics, wise to the countless Hollywood in-jokes). But Mr. Ehrenreich in particular, who took lessons in rope tricks (with both lasso and spaghetti), horseback riding, guitar and gun slinging to prepare, earned raves.Charming, The New York Times wrote. Superb, Variety wrote.Alden is the kind of actor that steals every scene hes in, Mr. Clooney wrote in an email. Its so much fun to watch how hard he works and how effortless it seems.Hobie Doyle would seem an odd choice for Mr. Ehrenreich, a kid from Los Angeles (he attended the Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences, in Santa Monica, Calif., where Jonah Hill and Jack Black were also students). He campaigned for an audition and won the role  in part, one suspects, because he has such an affinity with old Hollywood himself.Unlike many of his contemporaries vying to be X-Men or rom-com heartthrobs, Mr. Ehrenreich resembles the stars of an earlier era. At 26, his hair is already silvering, as if by force of will. Raised by movie-buff parents, Mr. Ehrenreich speaks worshipfully of Paul Newman and Jimmy Stewart, Frank Capra and Elia Kazan.When you watch a lot of movies as a kid, the stories do shape a little bit how you view the world, he said.Mr. Ehrenreich spent a few years at New York University but left in 2011, without completing a degree. Film was always the goal. I just had a feeling of I know what I want to do, and I want to start doing it again, he said.In effect, he put himself through his own film school with Mr. Coppola, with whom he lived for weeks while preparing for Tetro. I was young enough that I didnt know not to pepper him with questions all day long, so thats all I did, Mr. Ehrenreich said. All day long, Im like, What was Robert Duvall like? What was Pacino like? It was the greatest mentorship I could have ever imagined from essentially my favorite director of all time.He repeated the process with Mr. Beatty, over hourslong meetings and lunches at the Musso & Frank Grill in Hollywood.When Mr. Ehrenreich got the Tetro role, he had appeared in zero films. But he impressed one of its executive producers, Fred Roos, who has worked with Mr. Coppola on casting and production since The Godfather.I think he can be a real star, Mr. Roos said. You will build movies around him. I think hes talented enough to bring off anything. One of my oldest friends in the business, whos a movie star that never fit any mold, is Jack Nicholson. Alden kind of has the Jack personality from the get-go.Mr. Ehrenreich is not a star, yet. Despite the accolades for Hail, Caesar! his day-to-day life is not radically different. He still goes most days to the one-room office he rents in West Hollywood to read scripts and write, on the lot where, by coincidence, Hail, Caesar! was shot. (It is the site of the original United Artists, the studio founded by Mr. Chaplin and others.)The office is so sparsely furnished as to be Kafkaesque, bare but for a cheap desk and two office chairs, an AM/FM radio and a college-dorm mini fridge plugged into one wall. The only bit of dcor, balanced facedown against one wall, is the oversize prop poster for Lazy Ol Moon, a Hobie Doyle western glimpsed in Hail, Caesar!Mr. Ehrenreich walks to work. The paparazzi have not yet noticed.Things changed a little bit, maybe, professionally, but Im learning how much you are always ignorant of what the life of something is outside of it, he said. It starts from zero every time. Every time you finish, youre unemployed.But whether he is aware of it, people are watching, inside the industry and outside of it. He has already shot the Iraq war drama The Yellow Birds, and Mr. Beattys film, whenever it arrives, will likely bring Mr. Ehrenreich even more attention. I think itll be a real step up for him, as far as things being offered to him, said Mr. Roos, who saw it in a private screening.So for now, he is adjusting to life on the cusp of stardom.You get used to it, though I dont think you ever really get used to it, he said of seeing himself onscreen. I remember the first time with Tetro. Its like when you look in the mirror at the end of a long day: Thats who I was all day? And its that, times 10."}
{"text": "PARIS  The Chinese-French conceptual artist Huang Yong Ping is known for fusing complex multicultural allusions into forms that are easy to recognize but hard to interpret. His latest creation, Empires, commissioned for theParis Monumentaart show, which begins on Sunday and runs through June 18, will take on the realms of military history and economic globalization.If bigger is better, this should qualify as top-notch art. Empires will fill the main hall of the Grand Palais exhibition space with 305 shipping containers piled in eight islands; a mobile gantry crane partly supporting an aluminum snake skeletonthat ismore than 250 meters, or 820 feet, long and coiled over the boxes; and a representation of Napoleons bicorn hat 50 times the size of the original. If Rabelaiss infant giantPantagruel had played with Lego bricks, his nursery might have looked like this.Putting it all together was a labor of Hercules, said Kamel Mennour, who represents Mr. HuanginParisandlooked after the logistics of the show. Forging the 130-ton snake alone involved five specialized metal foundries, one of them in China, Mr. Mennour said, andinstalling the artwork required a team of hundreds, working in shifts for more than 20 hours a day for 12 days. Its the biggest thing Ive ever done, he said.When you are inside the Grand Palais, you will not have a global view of the installation, Axelle Blanc, the Monumenta project coordinator, said in a joint interview with Mr. Huang, Mr. Mennour and Jean de Loisy, the curator of Empireand president of the Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum, before the opening. You will just see parts of it, she said. It is an artwork that initially resists global comprehension.Napoleons hat is a blown-up version of one he wore at the Battle of Eylau in East Prussia. The containers, bearing the logos of international shipping companies, are avatars of the boxes that transport 90 percent of world trade. The snake, a recurrent element in Mr. Huangs art, is an enigmatic symbol in both Chinese and Western mythology, endowed with multiple, contradictory qualities. Visually, the vertebrae of the snake mirror the delicate Art Nouveau iron ribs of the domed roof of the Grand Palais; and the rectangular arch of the gantry crane riffs on the series of arches inand near Paris, including the Grande Arche de la Dfense, which was built in 1989 for the bicentennial of the French Revolution.That was the year Mr. Huang, invited to participate ina group show at the Pompidou Center, left China for France. Finding himself abroad during the protests in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he chose to stay in the West, in exile.Mr. Huang, who was born in 1954 in Xiamen, had built a reputation in China as an avant-garde provocateur. In 1986, he founded Xiamen Dada, a postmodern group mixing Zen Buddhism with Dadaist surrealism, influenced by artists including Joseph Beuys, John Cage and Marcel Duchamp.Mr. Huang described hisartistic practicein that periodas anti-art, anti-history and anti-self-expression, a time when he created works formulated by the spin of a roulette wheel or the throw of divining sticks. In one piece, he conflated Chinese and Western art history by taking a book about each, and pulping them together in a washing machine.He is an artist like no other, Mr. de Loisy added. He is an artist-philosopher, at the same time a very classical artist and a very contemporary one, both very Chinese and very European.Hegel, Kant  he reads a lot of philosophy; and in his work he loves to recount stories, Mr. de Loisy said. He is a great fabulist, and his tales are totally open to interpretation.A lot of reading wentinto telling the tale that is the Monumenta show, Mr. Huang said.In history, empires were military and colonial; today, its more and more about economics, trade and markets, he said. You have the rise of multinationals that are sometimes larger than countries. They fight against each other to be the greatest empires. Its about delocalization, the globalization of all those powers. Its a food chain: They eat each other. The installation is a commentary about that, he added. Shipping containers are the instruments of a globalized economy and the real measure of the world chain of values."}

Millennials like me are going to be looking very closely at Mr. Trump, because it wouldnt feel like much of a democracy if for most of our lives the president was a Clinton or a Bush.If Mr. Trump tacks back to the center and takes a more liberal tone on things like social issues, he will win over a lot of people.Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic Party have lost touch with us young people. We are the cogs that are being ground to dust by a system perpetuated by the establishment. No matter how many glass ceilings Mrs. Clinton breaks, she is the center of that establishment.

{"text": "Under ordinary circumstances, naming a polar research ship after the naturalist David Attenborough would have made perfect sense.But these were not ordinary circumstances, because in announcing on Friday that the vessel would carry Mr. Attenboroughs name, the Science Ministry in Britain chose to disregard the opinion of the 124,000 people who voted for a different name in an online poll: Boaty McBoatface.The public provided some truly inspirational and creative names, and while it was a difficult decision, Im delighted that our state-of-the-art polar research ship will be named after one of the nations most cherished broadcasters and natural scientists, the universities and science minister, Jo Johnson, said in a statement.The Natural Environment Research Council, a British government agency, had tried to open things up on the Internet and let people suggest a name for the $287 million vessel in an online survey in March.That plan backfired, when the name Boaty McBoatface received overwhelming support. Many of those who voted for it were quick to express their disappointment.The initial suggestion to name the ship Boaty McBoatface took off: A Twitter account was created; a train was called Trainy McTrainface for a day; and even Cheesy McCheeseface surfaced online.Mr. Attenboroughs name received over 11,000 votes, putting him in fourth position when the poll closed on April 17.The government signaled that it was unlikely the name Boaty McBoatface would ever grace the ship. Mr. Johnson told The Daily Telegraph the government was looking for something that fits the mission and captures the spirit of scientific endeavor.On Friday, Mr. Johnson said the ship would be named after Mr. Attenborough in celebration of the broadcasters contribution to natural science.If the peoples will was ignored, their voice was heard: The name Boaty McBoatface will live on as a high-tech remotely operated submarine that will collect data and samples.Were ensuring that the Boaty name lives on through the sub-sea vehicle that will support the research crew, Mr. Johnson said.Still, that failed to satisfy supporters of the Boaty McBoatface handle, who made clear that this was not what they had voted for.James Hand, the man who initially coined Boaty McBoatface, said he was pleased that the name would live on.The name appeals to the child in us: Thats one of the reasons its been so popular, he said in a statement that referred to the Natural Environment Research Council. I never expected Boaty to become as popular as it has, and Im glad N.E.R.C. have chosen to harness some of that interest.He added he found the ships name, R.R.S. Sir David Attenborough, a fitting and excellent choice. He voted for Attenborough, despite having prompted the social media frenzy around the Boaty name.One of Britains most adored personalities, Mr. Attenborough said he was honored to give his name to the ship.I have been privileged to explore the worlds deepest oceans alongside amazing teams of researchers, he said in a statement. And with this new polar research ship, they will be able to go further and discover more than ever before."}

{"text": "The Republican Party banner was yanked at the seams on Thursday. Whether it unravels remains unclear.The highest-ranking elected Republican, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, told CNN that he could not yet support the partys standard-bearer, Donald J. Trump. The reason, he said, was that Mr. Trump did not yet bear the partys standards, a sentiment emphasizing the effect of Mr. Trumps statements about women, his aggressive comments and his positions that are at odds with the Republican platform in some cases.Yet Mr. Trump did not yield. In an uncharacteristically circumspect statement, Mr. Trump responded that he was not yet ready to support Mr. Ryans positions. The speaker is not only a favorite of Republican elites, hes a powerful elected official who has been seen as a savior of the conservative movement from which he emerged. Mr. Trump said he hoped that the two could come to terms at some point, another rarity from the presumptive presidential nominee.Mr. Ryans comments are not only about trying to leverage Mr. Trump to sand down his rougher edges, but they could position Mr. Ryan neatly for a presidential run in 2020, should Mr. Trump lose. He was the partys vice-presidential candidate in 2012, and some of his supporters hoped he would run this time.But the split indicates that it is unclear to whom precisely the Republican Party belongs. Right now, the party is a coalition of aligned interests stitching together a dwindling base of national support.

{"text": "Tampa Bay forward Brian Boyle was showered with boos Friday evening when the Lightning took the ice against the Islanders at Barclays Center for Game 4 of their N.H.L. Eastern Conference semifinal series.No surprise there.During pregame warm-ups on Tuesday, Boyle skated across the Islanders logo and mixed it up with defenseman Travis Hamonic.But the play that made Boyle villain No. 1 for Islanders fans came in overtime when Boyle flattened defenseman Thomas Hickey with a big hit at the blue line. Boyle then took a loose puck, passed to Victor Hedman and tapped in the rebound after Hedmans shot missed.Game over.The official on the play either overlooked Boyles hit or was too busy managing a game that is now being played at the speed of light, by athletes with larger and better-conditioned bodies, built like machines.Bigger, faster and stronger than in the past, hockey players are also just as committed as their predecessors were to getting away with as much as possible.Boyle, the Lightning center, is 6 feet 7 inches. So is goalie Ben Bishop. So is defenseman Andrej Sustr.The size of a professional football field has remained the same since the N.F.L. came into existence in 1920. The standard size of a basketball court has not changed in more than 50 years. Hockey has been played on a 200-by-85-foot rink over the last 50 years. With bigger and faster athletes playing on rinks and fields and courts whose dimensions have remained constant for decades, every sport  not just hockey  is impossible to referee without the all-seeing eye in the sky.There was a time when an officials word was sacrosanct, unimpeachable, irrefutable and undeniable. The official was the absolute authority.No longer.With the expanding use of video replay, its now common to have multibillion-dollar leagues issuing apologies and admitting that the officials on site blew a crucial call.This is not a case of sudden humility. The innovation that was supposed to be an entertaining bauble for fans has become a second-guessing Cyclops that has imprisoned the sports industry.Whats changed all this is technology and the access by fans to games, Lightning Coach Jon Cooper said after practice Thursday.A couple of decades ago, two cameras might have covered a game. Officiating mistakes happened, but they were less likely to be noticed. Today, 20 cameras are trained on a game  cameras trained on the blue line for offsides, or on players to monitor legal and illegal hits. What the naked eye might have missed is being seen by millions.So now, youve got all these eyes focused on our game, and it does nothing but back you into a corner, Cooper said, referring to the officials.The decline of the referee and the rise of the electric eye is a boon to fans. This probably gets them more engaged, Cooper said. Whether it makes them mad or sad or enraged, it keeps them engaged.Hockey, like its violent cousin, football, finds itself in the precarious position of trying to achieve a delicate balance of making a rough game appear safe while giving the fans what they crave. What they want is blood: hard hits and bone-crunching checks.The N.H.L. amped up the sport by removing the red line, combating obstruction, hooking and holding. Couple that with more athletic players competing in a confined space, and there will be lots of crowd-pleasing, rock-em sock-em action  not to mention an increasing number of injuries.You did everything to speed up the game and nothing to slow down the game, Cooper said. It makes the game exciting and fun, but theres a negative to that.When they hit harder, skate faster, eventually injuries are going to happen.Fans, in large part, want the unsafe. In hockey, officials walk a thin line about which bone-jarring hits to allow, and which to penalize.Replay was quickly used in Game 4. With 10 minutes 49 seconds left in the first period, Ryan Stromers redirected shot on goal was credited as a save, although the shot appeared to carry Bishop into the net. The official wanted to make sure, and after a five-minute consultation, the call on the ice was upheld.Still, getting it right with the naked eye seems to be growing increasingly rare. Officials miss a lot. We always knew they did, but the video now confirms it.The prevalence of instant replay has reduced officials to waiters who drop the puck, take care of the ball during breaks or try to prevent players from fighting.This week, the N.B.A. acknowledged that officials had missed five calls in the final 13.5 seconds of a game that the Oklahoma City Thunder won by a point over the San Antonio Spurs. Last season, the N.F.L. admitted that officials had missed several crucial calls in a playoff game.Owning up to mistakes is all well and good, but if I am a fan of the team that has been victimized by a call that cost it the game, the apologies do me no good.When it comes to a critical error, how far are leagues willing to go not only to get it right, but also to make it right? How far are we from the day when leagues will actually change a games result?I dont know if there is any way that you can do that, Cooper said. Technology is where its at, but ultimately Im a true believer in the idea that humans are playing the games, humans should officiate the games.For the time being, in Brooklyn, Islanders fans just wanted Brian Boyle to get what they thought he had coming to him."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  The lawsuit over Sumner M. Redstones competency took a startling turn on Friday when the judge interrupted afternoon testimony to say that he was strongly entertaining a motion by Mr. Redstones lawyers to dismiss the whole case.The development came after the ailing media mogul, in halting but fiery videotaped testimony, appeared to forcefully reject the proposal that his former lover, Manuela Herzer, who brought the lawsuit, make his health care decisions.Judge David J. Cowan delivered what amounted to a judicial bombshell as Dr. Stephen L. Read, an expert witness for Ms. Herzer, finished his testimony relating to Mr. Redstones competence. Gabrielle Vidal, a lawyer for Mr. Redstone, asked that the judge reconsider their request for a dismissal. Judge Cowan said that he was leaning toward dismissal, but that he would review the matter over the weekend, and asked both sides to submit briefs.A decision to dismiss would put an end to a bitter, monthslong legal battle that has included thousands of pages of documents and exposed lurid details that industry observers say have tarnished both sides. It would also leave in place, for now, the controlling structure of his two big media companies, Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone is a director, chairman emeritus and controlling shareholder of both, and remains in control until he is either declared incompetent or dies.In bringing the suit, Ms. Herzer had claimed that the 92-year-old billionaire wasnt competent when he removed her from a directive that would have put her in charge of his care. But in reopening the question of dismissal, Judge Cowan said he was relying heavily on Mr. Redstones own statements in a profanity-laced video that was played behind closed courtroom doors.I think he said what he wanted to say, Judge Cowan said of the 18-minute video, in which Mr. Redstone repeatedly used obscene epithets in referring to Ms. Herzer, and said he did not want her involved with his health care.How can I sit here and say, after seeing that video, No, youve got to have Manuela? Judge Cowan asked.In a brief verbal response to the judges remarks, Pierce ODonnell, Ms. Herzers lawyer, said that he still had a great deal of evidence to present. He further noted that the judge appeared to be reducing a complicated decision about Mr. Redstones well-being into a far simpler one  whether Ms. Herzer or Mr. Redstones until recently estranged daughter, Shari Redstone, should be left in charge of his care.In addition to Mr. Redstones testimony, the judge said he was also strongly influenced by Dr. Reads acknowledgment under cross-examination that Ms. Herzer at this point would not be a viable choice for management of Mr. Redstones current or future care.In his testimony, videotaped on Thursday, Mr. Redstone said that he hated Ms. Herzer. In response to a question about whether he wanted Ms. Herzer to make health care decisions for him, Mr. Redstone replied, No.I want Manuela out of my life, Mr. Redstone said at the end of the session when his lawyer asked what he wanted at the end of the trial. The videotaped testimony was shown after reporters and spectators were cleared from the courtroom and a transcript was provided to news organizations afterward.In response to a question from his lawyer about who he wants to make his health care decisions if he is unable to do so himself, he responded with the name of his daughter: Shar  Shari. He also confirmed that he had been seeing his family lately and was happy with the nursing care that he was receiving.While Ms. Herzer claims that she is concerned about Mr. Redstones well-being, his lawyers say that she is after his money. On the same day Ms. Herzer was removed from the health care directive, she was also removed from Mr. Redstones estate plan, in which he had planned to give her $50 million and his $20 million Los Angeles mansion.In his testimony, Mr. Redstone was able to answer some questions  especially those with yes or no answers  but did not respond to others. When asked what his birth name had been, for instance, he remained silent. (It is Sumner Murray Rothstein.) The transcript shows that the flow of the testimony was sporadic, and at one point his interpreter asked that Mr. Redstones dentures be adjusted in order to better understand him.But at other times Mr. Redstones comments were decisive and showed a glimmer of his well-known ferocity and penchant for profanity.In the first question, he was asked who Ms. Herzer was. His response denigrated her with two obscene words. He repeated that description of her several times over the course of his testimony.During the testimony, Mr. Redstone said yes in response to a question about whether Ms. Herzer stole money from him, but was not able to say how much money she stole. He also confirmed that he once said that she was the love of his life, but that he did not still love her.When he later was asked by his lawyer why Ms. Herzer was ejected, he said, She lied to me.When asked what Ms. Herzer had done to assist in his health care, he struggled to find words, repeated his obscenities about her, and failed to help an interpreter spell out an answer.Whats the first letter? the interpreter finally asked.L. The next letter? H. H. Next letter? I. E. H. E., the interpreter continued. She helped? Helped?In opening statements, Ms. Herzers lawyers sought to show that Mr. Redstone was mentally incompetent and under the undue influence of others when he removed Ms. Herzer last October from an advance directive that would have given her authority over his health care.Mr. ODonnell cast Ms. Redstone as the central villain in a supposed conspiracy to deceive and manipulate him.She established a broad intelligence-gathering network inside Mr. Redstones home, featuring a ring of spies, Mr. ODonnell said, in describing what he said was a yearlong effort by Ms. Redstone, then estranged from her father, to get control of his money and media properties.Robert N. Klieger, who represents Mr. Redstone, sharply dismissed the notion of a conspiracy. Instead, he said Ms. Herzer had worked to remain in Mr. Redstones good graces, and to share his wealth, by weaving lies about other women with whom the media executive had become romantically involved.The first witness to follow Mr. Redstones testimony Friday was Dr. Read, a psychiatrist who examined the media mogul in late January and in a report said the executive lacked decision-making capacity.Dr. Read called Mr. Redstone a thin shadow of what he was. He said he rated Mr. Redstones dementia, based on an earlier examination, as being toward the severe end of moderate.Dr. Read noted Mr. Redstones extreme difficulty in swallowing, and with what he called language production.Dr. Reads testimony also revealed that Mr. Redstone engaged in sports betting with friends and family. Mr. Redstone often doesnt know who is playing, but the bets are arranged so that Mr. Redstone always wins, Dr. Read said, adding that the mogul thinks he has a perfect record.In the afternoon, as testimony resumed after Judge Cowans statements about dismissal, Ms. Herzers legal team shifted gears by calling a Redstone caretaker. They sought to portray him as having been at the center of a conspiracy orchestrated by Shari Redstone, with an eye toward ousting Ms. Herzer and an another Redstone companion, Sydney Holland.That caretaker, a vocational nurse named Joseph Octaviano, acknowledged having regularly provided Ms. Redstone with reports of her fathers behavior, including his relationships with Ms. Herzer and Ms. Holland.Asked whether he would have been fired had Mr. Redstone known that he was reporting intimate details of his life, Mr. Octaviano said, Yes. Asked whether it would be fair to say that he hated Ms. Herzer, he again answered, Yes.Neither Keryn Redstone, a granddaughter of Mr. Redstone, nor Philippe Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, testified as scheduled."}
{"text": "After assuring Americans he is not running for president to make things unstable for the country, the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, suggested that he might reduce the national debt by persuading creditors to accept something less than full payment.Asked on Thursday whether the United States needed to pay its debts in full, or whether he could negotiate a partial repayment, Mr. Trump told the cable network CNBC, I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.He added, And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you cant lose.Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent. The United States government is able to borrow money at very low interest rates because Treasury securities are regarded as a safe investment, and any cracks in investor confidence have a long history of costing American taxpayers a lot of money.Experts also described Mr. Trumps proposal as fanciful, saying there was no reason to think Americas creditors would accept anything less than 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of Mr. Trumps deal-making prowess.No one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the U.S. Treasury tried to make that call, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP. Why should they? They have a contract requiring payment in full.Mr. Trump told CNBC that he was concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on the cost of servicing the federal debt. Were paying a very low interest rate, he said. What happens if that interest rate goes two, three, four points up? We dont have a country. I mean, if you look at the numbers, theyre staggering.The Congressional Budget Office projects that interest payments on the federal debt will climb to $500 billion in 2020 from roughly $250 billion this year. That is based on a projection that rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury will reach 4.1 percent in late 2019, still a low level by historical standards. If rates were to climb more quickly, or reach higher levels, debt payments would be higher.Pressed to elaborate on his remarks, Mr. Trump did appear to step back. He said that he was not suggesting a default, but instead that the government could seek to repurchase debt for less than the face value of the securities. The government, in other words, would seek to repay less money than it borrowed.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that she shared Mr. Trumps concern about the size of the federal debt, but that the issue needed to be addressed through changes in fiscal policy  some combination of less spending and more revenue.Its a policy problem, not a debt-management problem, she said. When it comes to fiscal responsibility, people are always looking for the easiest of answers. If there were low-hanging fruit here, the Treasury Department would already be on it.Repurchasing debt is a fairly common tactic in the corporate world, but it only works if the debt is trading at a discount. If creditors think they are going to get 80 cents for every dollar they are owed, they may be overjoyed to get 90 cents. Mr. Trumps companies had sometimes been able to retire debt at a discount because creditors feared they might default.But Mr. Trumps statement might show the limits of translating his business acumen into the world of government finance. The United States simply cannot pursue a similar strategy. The government runs an annual deficit, so it must borrow to retire existing debt. Any measures that would reduce the value of the existing debt, making it cheaper to repurchase, would increase the cost of issuing new debt. Such a threat also could undermine the stability of global financial markets.In 1979, for example, what the government described as bookkeeping problems temporarily delayed $120 million in interest payments. In the aftermath of the delay, investors pushed up interest rates on Treasuries by about 0.6 percentage point, according to a 1989 study by Terry L. Zivney of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and Richard D. Marcus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. That cost taxpayers roughly $12 billion.In 2011, federal borrowing costs climbed as congressional Republicans refused for a time to increase the federal governments statutory borrowing limit, raising doubts about the governments ability to repay its debts. The Bipartisan Policy Center calculated that the higher rates will cost taxpayers about $19 billion.There is a limited opportunity for Mr. Trump to pursue bond buybacks without disrupting markets. He could seek to take advantage of the markets preference for brand-new Treasuries. In a longstanding quirk, older vintages of Treasuries trade at slightly lower prices than the latest issuance. Treasury officials have discussed issuing new debt to fund purchases of older debt, but they would do so because newer securities are easier for investors to buy and sell. That might improve the workings of financial markets. Any savings, however, would be small change.It would not move the needle at all on the overall debt, Mr. Crandall, the economist, said."}

{"text": "WILLIAMSON, W.Va.  Hillary Clintons campaign is trying to seize on the turmoil Donald J. Trumps ascent has caused within the Republican Party, hoping to gain the support of Republican voters and party leaders including former elected officials and retired generals disillusioned by their partys standard-bearer.The efforts come after the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, on Thursday said he was just not ready to back Mr. Trump, comments the Clinton campaign giddily blasted out in an email and on social media. At the same time, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton, intends to reach out to Republican megadonors disillusioned by their partys presumptive nominee.More broadly, Mrs. Clintons campaign is repositioning itself, after a year of emphasizing liberal positions and focusing largely on minority voters, to also appeal to independent and Republican-leaning white voters turned off by Mr. Trump.With the Democratic nomination in sight, Mrs. Clinton has broadened her economic message, devoted days to apologizing for a comment she previously made that angered working-class whites, and pledged that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains widely popular among the blue-collar voters drawn to Mr. Trump, would come out of retirement and be in charge of creating jobs in places that have been particularly hard hit.The effort is a striking turn after she spent the past year trying to mobilize the liberal wing and labor leaders in the Democratic Party. But her campaign, confident that the young people and liberals backing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will come around to support Mrs. Clinton in November, is focusing its efforts on white working-class women and suburban women who tend to vote for Republican presidential candidates, but who polls show hold negative views of Mr. Trump.Im here because I want you to know whether people vote for me or not, whether they yell at me or not, its not going to affect what I will do to help, Mrs. Clinton told residents at a health clinic here on Monday, as protesters chants outside of Hillary, go home! could be heard.The campaign expects to assemble a Republicans for Hillary group, and Mrs. Clinton has, from her days in the Senate and as secretary of state, cultivated strong relationships with prominent Republicans and their top staff members. Mark Salter, a top adviser to Senator John McCain, this week expressed his support for Mrs. Clinton on Twitter minutes after Mr. Trump clinched his partys nomination. Mrs. Clinton has also enjoyed a strong relationship with former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, a Republican, who described her as a superb representative of the United States all over the world.In the past, Mrs. Clinton has praised David H. Petraeus, former director of the C.I.A., who is a Republican. In February, he said that Mrs. Clinton would be a tremendous president.Mrs. Clintons two-day swing across Appalachia this week served as the beginning of the campaigns full-court press to convince persuadable white voters that she would run a more inclusive campaign than Mr. Trump  and to signal that she would cede no demographic group to him.I invite a lot of Republicans and independents who Ive been seeing on the campaign trail, whove been reaching out to me, I invite them to join with Democrats, Mrs. Clinton told CNN on Wednesday. Lets get off the red or the blue team. Lets get on the American team.In the Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton has struggled with non-college-educated white voters and self-identified independents, often losing those groups by wide margins to Mr. Sanders. But faced with the choice between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, 51 percent of independents and 59 percent of moderates favor the former secretary of state, compared with 41 percent and 39 percent for Mr. Trump, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll.If the primary happened to be over already, we feel the coalition weve built has the makings of a winning coalition as it is in a general election, said Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman. But, he added, were not satisfied with that. We want to make inroads even with populations that arent supporting her in great numbers.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said while campaigning with her at a diner in Athens, Ohio, on Tuesday that the suburban women in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati could ultimately decide the November election. I think educated suburban white women, to be sure, are going to be turned off en masse and there will be more of that, he said, referring to their opinion of Mr. Trump.On Friday, President Obama helped in Mrs. Clintons effort. Republican women, voters, are going to have to decide, Is that the guy I feel comfortable with representing me, and what I care about? he said of Mr. Trump at a news conference.But if Mrs. Clintons Breaking Down Barriers Tour in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia this week provided a road map for her campaigns strategy in the weeks ahead, the antagonistic reception she received also highlighted her own vulnerabilities and tendency to divide people  weaknesses Mr. Trump plans to exploit.At Mrs. Clintons event in Athens, a protester, Peter Schmidt, 34 and a miller, held a handmade sign that read Id Rather Be Home Reading Your Goldman Sachs Transcripts, a reference to the paid speeches she delivered to the Wall Street bank. Mr. Schmidt said her tour of Appalachia felt like pandering. I dont trust her, he said. Thats why Im holding this sign.Mr. Trump, who has proved adept in connecting with white working-class men, also plans to hit Mrs. Clinton on her previous support for global trade deals that many Americans blame for jobs moving overseas. He has giddily seized on a comment she made to CNN in March that were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.The backlash over that remark  made in the context of replacing coal with clean energy jobs  turned Mrs. Clintons campaign events into an Appalachian apology tour, as she was repeatedly, and pointedly, forced to explain what she called a misstatement.I cant take it back, Mrs. Clinton told one out-of-work coal industry worker, Bo Copley, 39, a father of three and a registered Republican, when he emotionally confronted her about the comment. What I want you to know is Im going to do everything I can to help no matter what happens politically, she added. That is just how I am made.The Clinton campaign is also moving to exploit the public criticism of Mr. Trump by prominent Republicans.On Wednesday, the campaign released an online ad that quotes Mr. Trumps former primary opponents describing him as a know-nothing candidate, a narcissist and the most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency, among other epithets.Mrs. Clinton has portrayed Mr. Trump as a loose cannon on foreign policy and often points to her husbands record as evidence that she would help blue-collar voters. The brilliance of Bill Clinton gives her a particular edge, said Gaston Caperton, a Democratic former governor of West Virginia who supports Mrs. Clinton.Even with Mr. Clinton in its corner, the Clinton campaign does not expect to win voters like Mr. Copley, who said he is undecided but who generally fits Mr. Trumps core demographic of supporters. But Mrs. Clinton hopes to make inroads with women like Mr. Copleys wife, Lauren  voters whom Clinton aides call megachurch moms and describe as religious, Republican-leaning women who reject Mr. Trump.Christine Matthews, a researcher who advises Republicans on how to win female voters, said that portraying Mr. Trump as dangerous on foreign policy could help Mrs. Clinton draw some Republican women whose most important issues are national security and terrorism. Can she drive moms who have kids who think, Oh my gosh, this is too scary a prospect and our country wont be safe if hes elected president?  Ms. Matthews said. You can imagine that attack ad in your head.Democrats acknowledge that the prospect of terrifying skeptical voters into supporting their candidate would not be the most inspirational campaign message.It is a far bleaker appeal than Ronald Reagans message of American exceptionalism and Mr. Clintons promise to restore the forgotten middle class, both of which inspired white working-class voters to cross party lines.But Mrs. Clintons pitch to Republicans reflects the grim political realities of 2016: More than half of the registered voters who said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton planned to do so in opposition to Mr. Trump, rather than in support of her candidacy, according to the CNN/ORC poll.Her bumper sticker for Republicans should be Unified Against Trump or Vote for the enemy. Its important,  said Ben Howe, a Republican and a contributing editor at the conservative online publication Red State, who posted the Clinton campaigns #ImWithHer slogan on Twitter after Mr. Trumps decisive victory in Indiana.Or, as Jan Franck, 65, a retiree in Charleston, W.Va., put it after hearing Mrs. Clinton speak on Tuesday: She could be a sock puppet running against Donald Trump, and Id vote for her."}
{"text": "Shareholder activism has expanded well beyond the stereotypical irate hedge fund manager, pounding his fists on the table for corporate changes. Mutual funds have started agitating publicly, as have pension funds. And on Friday, even a prominent family stepped into the ring.Wildcat Capital  which manages $1.79 billion for David Bonderman, the founding partner of the private equity firm TPG Capital, and his family  is seeking a corporate-governance overhaul at Sorrento Therapeutics, a developer of cancer treatments based in San Diego. The stock of Sorrrento, a biotech company, has plummeted more than 75 percent since July, to a $220 million market valuation.The move is an uncommon one for a family office, which is a professional investment manager for a wealthy family. Given that such offices do not manage outside capital as a hedge fund or mutual fund would, and that they deal with the finances of billionaires, their activities are often private.Wildcat Capital, which owns 2.5 million shares, or 6.5 percent, of Sorrento, took that rare step on Friday, calling out egregious actions undertaken by Sorrentos management and board in a letter it publicized. The family office, led by Leonard A. Potter, demanded that the board fire Sorrentos chief executive, put a halt to the remainder of a private placement, appoint three new directors and hire an investment banker to help sell the company.As activism has spread to almost every corner of investing over the last few years, a few family offices have felt so emboldened. This year in London, for example, Western Gate Private Investments, the family office for the Portuguese physicist Luis Amaral, began demanding management changes at Stock Spirits, a vodka maker.In his long letter to Sorrentos board on Thursday, Mr. Potter, the president and chief investment officer of Wildcat, explained the actions that led him to take his first activist stance.Sorrento was transferring assets into various subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries then issued significant amounts of stock options and warrants, some with higher-priority voting privileges, to a select group of executives and board members, according to the letter. This series of transactions appears to be little more than a looting of the company assets, Mr. Potter said.Mr. Potter also criticized Sorrentos licensing and investment strategies, which have prevented the company from gaining control or influence in those situations. Sorrento also engaged in a private placement of as much as $150 million worth of shares with two groups of Asian investors, which could represent 45 percent of the companys outstanding shares. Mr. Potter said that investors did not receive sufficient disclosure related to this transaction and that it diluted the holdings of existing shareholders.As a result, Mr. Potter called for the immediate termination of Henry Ji, the chief executive of Sorrento, and asked that the company halt the portion of the private placement that has not yet been issued. The letter also requested that the board appoint three directors nominated by Wildcat, create a committee to find an interim chief executive and hire a banker to sell the company.We are not activists  in fact, we tried to be constructive and offered our assistance to Dr. Ji, said Mr. Potter in an emailed statement. However, after being rebuffed and seeing the continuing actions of Dr. Ji and the board, we felt it was necessary to take this step immediately in order to protect and maximize shareholder value.Kevin M. Herde, chief financial officer at Sorrento, declined to comment on the Wildcat Capital letter.Sorrento shares plummeted more than 15 percent to about $5.50 on Friday, almost half the price at which Wildcat Capital acquired them last May. Wildcat is the second-largest investor in Sorrento after the Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation."}
{"text": "Devon, Alberta  I DONT know if my house still exists. I believe it does, for now. The latest reports show 12 homes destroyed in our neighborhood in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Theyre trailer homes, on the other side of the main road from us, edging up against the forest. This is oil sands country, and although this is a depressed economy, the trailer homes are worth about $500,000 each. Even in Canadian currency thats a lot.Ive been in Alberta about a decade now. We revel in our cowboy culture here, our Texas-meets-Montana beef-ranching and oil-pumping way of life. When it comes to crises we pride ourselves on being able to manage. But the fires that are raging now are growing at a rate that can barely be managed, let alone put out.The Fort McMurray community of nearly 80,000 is in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands region. Unlike drilling, extracting oil from sand is costly, and works best when the price of oil is high. The last decade saw a boom of near-Klondike proportions. People from all over the country moved here, and a lot of them maxed out their lives  adding A.T.V.s and dirt bikes to their driveways, and working too many shifts to ever drive them. Then, around 2014, the overtime dried up, though people were still trying to live a time-and-a-half life. During the boom, people planned new facilities and infrastructure upgrades dependent on a future blessed with oil at $100 a barrel. Now empty lots lie undeveloped, waiting for the next upturn. If it comes.Weve had perfect conditions for a fire: A mild winter and a drier than usual spring caused lower moisture levels. One spark can grow quickly here, in boreal Canada, where forests surround the town. Unseasonal swirling winds took it from brush fire to disaster.When we left our home to drive north to a safe place to take shelter on Tuesday, the roads were clogged, with traffic almost at a standstill. The trip we set out on normally takes 45 minutes; this time it took six times as long. For people who left after we did, it took twice as much again. I tried to imagine what that would have been like: nine hours, crawling along with an anxious beagle and a fractious 7-year-old on board. No thanks.As we drove, we could see the fire in the distance, threatening the town. Radio reports confirmed what we finally realized. This was no overnight inconvenience. The evacuation was Albertas biggest, a whole town emptied in a polite and orderly fashion, according to the Canadian stereotype.My wife was out at site, the local name for the oil sands businesses. Her company, Syncrude, reopened lodgings set to be demolished, and by my reckoning were able to accommodate close to 3,000 employees and their families, for which we were all thankful. The mattresses had dubious stains and no bedding, but they were safe from the fire.We left at just after 5 the next morning, heading back south to somewhere we could stay longer. Everybody who left town and drove north, between 10,000 and 20,000 of us, knew that at some point we had to return. Past our burning homes and our deserted city.As we came back toward town, the smoke was wall-like, reducing visibility to a few yards ahead of our lights. The flames had crossed the highway already, and we had been told they had also jumped the Athabasca River, about the length of a football field. It was scarcely believable until we saw the burned grass on both banks.Our home was surrounded by houses that are burning. Later we heard the firefighters had been pulled out of our suburb. Either theyve won, or lost. We fear the latter.The day we left, some of our friends were dousing their cedar-shingled roofs with their garden hoses. It was futile, and they knew it, but the brain seizes under pressure. One neighbor packed his lawn mower, surely not an essential wherever he was heading. Later, on the way north, I fretted about the bananas I had left on the counter, wondering if they would ooze all over the place as they rotted.The smoke billowed and hovered, rank and nasty. It felt like a film set. Tom Cruise would come around the corner and be told off by Emily Blunt. Theyd laugh, hear Cut, and call for a do-over. But there are no second chances in Fort McMurray, not at the moment. My family and I made it out of town on Wednesday 30 minutes before they closed the road south. We dont know when we will be allowed back. Home is an R.V. parked at my brother-in-laws house. Were lucky.Throughout all of this, the population of Fort McMurray kept growing: Two babies were born in work lodges north of the city.I sought counsel from people who had made it through a 2011 fire. Keep your receipts, and when you get home dont try to clean a fridge with two weeks worth of rotten food. Get rid of it, advised a survivor of both infernos.I think I can stop worrying about my bananas."}
{"text": "LEXINGTON, Ky.  Buried on the grounds of Gainesway Farms perfectly manicured 1,500 acres are several champion racehorses, including the prolific gray sire Mahmoud, a grandfather of the first gray horse to win the Kentucky Derby.Not far from the grave site, Tapit, a gray sire whose libido and fertility are rivaling those of the greats, resides in a plush corner stall next to his son Tapizar and across the way from American Pharoahs grandfather Empire Maker. Tapit is brilliant white now, almost ghostlike, and blends in among the eight white stucco stallion barns.At 15, he has passed along enough of his hot blood, as the stallion manager Carl Buckler likes to call it, to establish himself as a two-time champion sire and to command a $300,000 stud fee, the highest in North America. So far, his progeny have won 45 graded stakes races, including 17 in Grade I, and earned more than $91 million.On Saturday, three of his sons  Mohaymen, Creator and Lani, all gray  plus a fourth gray colt, Destin, a son of Giants Causeway, will compete in the Kentucky Derby, casting a rare silver sheen on the most famous horse race in America. (Two daughters, Royal Obsession and Taxable, raced in the Kentucky Oaks on Friday.)The highest number of gray horses to run in a Derby field dating back to 1930 is five, in 1968 and 1981. Only eight gray horses have won the Kentucky Derby: Determine (1954) and his son Decidedly (1962); Spectacular Bid (1979); Gato Del Sol (1982); Winning Colors (1988); Silver Charm (1997); Monarchos (2001); and Giacomo (2005). Yet if Saturdays race goes off with a full 20-horse field, there is a 20 percent chance the winner will be gray.To have four gray horses heading into the Derby starting gate, let alone three sired by Tapit, is a statistical oddity considering that only 1,937, or 8 percent, of the 23,169 foals registered with the Jockey Club from the 2013 foal crop were gray or roan. Bay was the most popular color, with 8,211, or 35 percent.He really seems to be positioning himself for greatness because he has had so much success, said Edward L. Bowen, a horse racing historian and the president of the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. The influence of Tapit will go on for generations.The gray of all grays was Native Dancer, whose only career loss came in the 1953 Kentucky Derby. Nicknamed the Gray Ghost, Native Dancer captured the attention of many by standing out on black-and-white television screens.Another standout gray, Skip Away, the champion 3-year-old male in 1996, was purchased by the Hall of Fame trainer Sonny Hine for his wife, Carolyn, who had vision problems and wanted a gray horse because they were easier to spot on the racetrack.Tapit won the Wood Memorial in 2004, but his racing career was cut short after only six races because of recurring lung infections. So he was sent to the breeding shed, where he could pass on genes he inherited from standouts like Native Dancer, Mr. Prospector, Seattle Slew, A. P. Indy and Unbridled.He had a fabulous pedigree, and all the qualities needed, so we thought he would make a good sire, said his trainer, Michael Dickinson. I cant say that we thought he would be this good. But we always had a lot of confidence in him.To produce a gray horse, only one copy of a dominant gene is needed, from either the mother or the father, according to Ernest Bailey, a geneticist at the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky. If both parents are gray, there is at least a 75 percent chance the foal will be gray, Bailey said. If one parent is gray, there is at least a 50 percent chance of the foals being gray. But every horse that is gray has at least one gray parent.When gray horses are born, they are usually a solid color, like bay or chestnut, and have flecks of gray hair. Some would identify that as roan. But just like humans, as the horses age, they become more gray and eventually turn almost white. The colors gray and roan were once recognized separately by the Jockey Club on certificates of foal registration, but the categories were merged beginning with the foal crop of 1993.Combining the two colors into one category reduced the number of corrections, saving breeders and owners the time and expense associated with filing for corrected certificates of foal registration, said Rick Bailey, the Jockey Club registrar.The only clear differences between gray horses and bays or chestnuts, is that grays are easier to spot and harder to keep clean. Tapit, who loves to roll around in the mud, is given multiple baths a day and is even vacuumed to keep him looking regal.Because they stand out, gray horses have become popular among bettors: Im betting the gray is a common phrase heard at racetracks.The Derby is so unique because you have a lot of people betting who dont normally bet, and pick horses based on names, numbers and colors, Bowen said. It will be interesting to see if the allure of the gray has an effect on the odds Saturday.Sarah Duffy, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, is one of those fans. There is something mystical about the grays, she said. They have a spirit.This year, she has plenty of grays to choose from. She is picking Mohaymen to win the Derby because she likes the even color of his coat and the look in his eyes. She is hoping that he can treat fans to a second consecutive Triple Crown sweep, following American Pharoahs sweep last year.Ive been a fan of the ponies since I was a young girl, Duffy said. My mom claims it is because she and I watched the last Triple Crown winner when she was pregnant with me. I waited the full 37 years to see one on the outside.Tapits sire, Pulpit, was known to be a handful, and Tapit has passed on his fathers aggressive nature to several offspring. His progeny at the Derby have acted up while training on the racetrack, in the paddock and in the starting gate.If you didnt know the horse, hed be a tough horse to fool with, Buckler, the stallion manager, said of Tapit. But if you get to know him, and respect him, hell respect you. Hes more aggressive than my other horses. I say its his bloodline. At least we got the good end of it: stakes winners.Tapits demeanor serves him well in the breeding shed, where he has no trouble keeping his focus.Hes easy to handle when he gets into the breeding shed; its all action, Buckler said. Theres no coaxing. Zero. You just stand behind the mare with him and let him get ready.His owner Ron Winchell, who retained a 50 percent stake in Tapit and is able to watch him any time of day from a security camera feed, said Tapit was more playful than anything else. When he was racing, he would literally take stuff out of his stall and throw it, he said. Its not a mean aggressive, more of like, Ha ha I got you. Winchell is in an awkward spot this week. He owns Gun Runner, who is trained by Steve Asmussen and is not a Tapit colt. But Asmussen also trains Creator, a Tapit colt not owned by Winchell. Either way, though, Winchell would win if one of those horses crossed the finish line first.I would have thought our horse in the Derby would have been a Tapit, but its not, and its even funnier that Steve has a Tapit, and its not ours, Winchell said. Ideally it would be us in first, and a Tapit in second.No matter what happens Saturday, Tapit will keep breeding up to 135 mares a year, performing up to three times a day. His handlers hope he keeps producing champions.The only competition Tapit has is himself, Michael Hernon, the director of sales at Gainesway, said, referring to Tapits earnings of $18.3 million in 2015, breaking his own North American record of $16.8 million in 2014.Asked if the farm staff would do anything special for the champion stallion should one of his sons win the Derby  adorn his stall with roses, perhaps  Hernon replied: I dont know if hes a roses kind of guy. He prefers Champagne."}
{"text": "Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment.1. This victory is not a surprise to the average American, such as graduates with masters degrees working for $12 an hour, trying to pay off $30,000 in student loans or 50-year-olds with $400 left in savings after being unemployed for two years.We need jobs, not handouts. Hillary wants to help the poor.Heres a better idea  create jobs so there arent any poor to help. Trump gets it. He is one of the few who understand what the average American is going through. Lark, reacting to an article about Donald J. Trump all but securing the Republican presidential nomination after the Indiana primary.2. Im voting for Trump because he is the best chance we have to destroy the Republican party. He may get to try some crazy stuff for two years. However, he is president, not dictator.Then, in two years, liberals (I hope a liberal Third Party develops) take over Congress. Then, in four years, we got a generation of liberal control.Since the media and the Democratic party destroyed Bernie (our real hope for change), the only option left to produce radical change is to vote Trump. Jacqueline in Colorado.3. What sank Cruz is that despite liberal assurances to the contrary and even Republican fears, the people clearly believe that Trump is the most electable Republican  and I agree.As president, Trump clearly wouldnt apply ideological litmus tests to decisions, but identify what he perceived to be Americas interests and decide on that basis. Doubtless, there would be both Democrats AND Republicans who disagreed with him; but, you know  I suspect that I wouldnt. Richard Luettgen in New Jersey, reacting to a column by Frank Bruni about Senator Ted Cruz of Texas ending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.4. I joined the party of Lincoln and Reagan, but I cannot belong to the party of Trump.Ill likely vote for Gary Johnson in November, but if somehow the polls show a close race between Trump and Clinton, Ill do what six months ago I would have considered inconceivable: vote for Hillary Clinton. Time for a shower now  Michael in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., reacting to an article about prominent Republicans questioning whether they can vote for Mr. Trump.5. Regardless of the outcome of this primary, Bernie Sanders has indeed been crucially important in reminding the Democratic Party that  yes, indeed  the people support, and are willing to fight for, progressive policies.These are the same policies which once defined the Democratic Party until they jettisoned them in the late eighties in their pivot to the right.Like it or not, the views of Bernie Sanders are the future of the Democratic Party.If they want to keep winning elections  including this one  they had better internalize this, and start acting on it. Dominic in New York, reacting to an editorial about Senator Bernie Sanderss role in pushing the Democratic Party further left.This comment received over 790 reader recommendations.6. Heres the deal. The people cited in this article  obese subjects and the researchers alike  can complain, overstudy, overmedicate ... whatever.But the truth is the truth. Want to stay skinny and look good? Prepare to work out hard every day ... and to be hungry.Its that simple. IJN in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., reacting to an article about a study conducted on former contestants on The Biggest Loser, and why they struggle to maintain weight loss.This comment received 46 reader responses.7. When I had toddlers, I child-locked all the kitchen and bathroom cabinets, I gated off the stairs, I child-proofed the house.I put them in car seats and strollers with straps. They slept in cribs with high rails and bumpers. I tested the temperature of their bottles.I treated them like the fragile precious beings that they were.My number one job for the first five or six years of their lives was to make sure they didnt accidentally kill themselves.The thought of leaving anything dangerous within their grasp let alone a gun gave me anxiety.What kind of person leaves a gun anywhere near a child? Aimlow Joe in New York, reacting to an article about four toddlers who accidentally shot and killed themselves during one week in April.This comment received over 1,100 reader recommendations.8. Ive worked with a lot of women and gay men (Im a psychologist) who have been involved in sex trafficking and prostitution. Ive yet to find one who found it empowering, or thought they had any other choice.Legalizing it will not change it or make it safe, just like legalizing drugs does not eliminate the underground drug market.It should not be legal, and it is not victimless.If we really want to make a difference, how about creating programs to give at-risk women and youth other options?And for those that like prostitution and have the luxury of being able to freely choose it  rest assured, there will always be a market for you. PG in New York, responding to a Times Magazine article about a movement among sex workers and activists to decriminalize prostitution. This comment had over 320 reader recommendations and 22 reader responses.9. The word purse has always disgusted me.A combination of the sound and also the thing  the constant piece of luggage that women are sentenced to lug around.Hate the closed jaws. Just hate the word and the thing. Yuck. Socanne in Tucson, reacting to an article about a study that explores why some words induce a visceral disgust reaction.10. As a food lover, this is horrifying and absolutely disgusting. Nails are one of the dirtiest places on the human body. Calla Meza on The Timess Facebook page, responding to an article about KFC marketing a line of lickable, edible nail polish in two flavors, Original, and Hot and Spicy, in Hong Kong.This comment received 83 likes."}

{"text": "VARIETY PUZZLE  One of my favorite things about digging into a cryptic crossword puzzle is the chance to really see the many devious ways in which constructors like Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon think. For beginners, the clues in a cryptic crossword might sound like gibberish, but there is a method to their madness.Each cryptic clue has a recipe of sorts: There will be a definition of the entry, followed or preceded by a hint as to how to figure it out and a number or numbers in parentheses that indicates how many words are in the answer and how many letters are in each word. The constructor will do his or her best to make a sentence that sounds like it means one thing but really means something entirely different. You will be asked to rip words apart and put them back together again in ways you might never have thought were possible. You will find yourself thinking about puns, anagrams, soundalikes and more.Cryptic crosswords are fun, and theyre a chance to give your brain a really fun stretch. Plus, if you go to any other part of the world and feel like doing a crossword puzzle, this will be what you see; the puzzles you do during the rest of the week here are known as American-style crosswords. So its as good a time as any to get used to them.This post is by no means a thorough look at how to solve cryptics, but here are a few interesting clue/entry pairings and their categories that will at least get you started: 1As Toasted snacks from a varied spectrum (8) has a single-word, 8-letter answer. Heres a hint: any time you see a word like varied, think anagrams. Sometimes a constructor will use words that connote changing the letters around, like mixed, jumpy, tossed about or scrambled. The definition will always be at the beginning or the end, and today its at the beginning: Toasted snacks, and we have to make them from a varied spectrum. Varied tells us to anagram the only 8-letter word in the clue, spectrum, and from that we get CRUMPETS. Yum.Still with me?Constructors see things differently than most people do. They might look at a word and see components that make other words, then rip them apart and put them back together again to make different ones. 11As Nary a cheer for Ms. Jones (5) has the definition at the beginning as well. In this case, however, we need to figure out who Ms. Jones is and why she was snubbed so badly. You might be thinking of singer NORAH Jones, and youd be correct, but do you know why? Its because if you split her name up as NO RAH, you get a synonym for nary a cheer.These are the types of clues that will make you snort, if you succeed in figuring them out. 3Ds Spinoza followers job at a trouser shop? (9) may seem opaque, but its hilarious. Youve been told that youre to think about a trouser shop, so you know this will have something to do with pants. If you know anything about Baruch Spinoza, you know that he was a pantheist, in that he saw God in all things. Lets take a closer look at that word. PANTHEIST can be separated into two words: PANT HEIST. Darn it if that follower of Spinoza didnt pull a HEIST, or a job, at the PANTs shop. Youve got to watch those philosophers.I know, my brain hurts too. But it hurts in a way that feels good, doesnt it? Cryptics are a totally different experience than American-style crosswords, and I hope you grow to love them as much as I do. It just takes some practice to get the hang of the solve.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "It already looks clear that many Obamacare insurance plans are going to raise their prices significantly.Over the last few years, average premium increases in the Obamacare markets have been lower than the increases for people who bought their own insurance in premiums before the Affordable Care Act. But several trends are coming together that suggest that pattern will break when plan premiums are announced in early November. Many plans may increase prices by 10 percent, or more. Over the last two years, Ive written articles warning against scary headlines that exaggerate premium increases. Next year, those scary headlines are more likely to be accurate.Peter Lee runs the countrys largest and most stable state marketplace, Covered California. The typical rate increase has been only 4 percent over the last two years. Next year will be different. We expect our rates to go up more than that this year, he said at a recent meeting with health reporters. He predicted big rate increases in other states.Only two states have collected proposed rates for 2017 yet, but in both of them, popular carriers are asking for double-digit increases. Insurers dont always get what they want, and there is local variation in insurance rates, but these early requests are in line with statements from insurance officials and regulators about what to expect.Most people who are buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces will not feel the effects of these increases; the formula that calculates federal subsidies will offset the increases for them. But rising prices will hurt higher-income Americans who have to pay their own premiums. That group is already paying a lot for health insurance, and the coverage often comes with high deductibles and other forms of out-of-pocket expenses.Thats a problem, but some context is helpful. Higher prices are not, by themselves, a sign that the insurance marketplaces are dysfunctional or failing. Most of the reasons prices will go up next year are pretty predictable. The initial prices for Obamacare plans were much lower than forecasters expected. To some extent, the coming increases will be a correction, not a sign that markets are spiraling out of control.There are three main reasons premiums are likely to be substantially more expensive  and one factor offsetting the increases:Being treated will cost more in 2017 than it does now. Thats true for everyone using the medical system  not just people with Obamacare plans. It will be true for people in government insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid and for people who get their insurance through work. The cost of medical care basically goes up every year, so thats not a huge surprise. But the last few years, that growth has been very slow by historical standards. Actuaries are predicting that 2017s bump will be a little bigger. That increase is not because of Obamacare, but because of drugmakers releasing more new, expensive products; hospitals raising prices; and doctors offering more technologically complex treatments. Actuaries differ a bit in their estimates, and the cost of medical care varies by place, but the estimate Ive heard in my reporting is somewhere around 6 percent.The health law included some protections for insurance companies in the first few years, devised to help the markets become stabilized and protect insurers who made miscalculations in setting prices while they were getting used to things. Two such programs expire at the end of this year. One is currently paying the bills for the rare patients who require extremely expensive medical care. Another was set up to protect insurers who made bad guesses on how sick their overall pool of customers would be. Together, the loss of those protections is expected to raise rates by about 4 percent.Even if medical costs stayed flat and the early buffer programs continued, a lot of insurance companies would still be raising their rates. Thats because the prices many of them charged in the first few years werent high enough to cover the medical bills of their customers. Some insurers bet so badly that they have gone under or have chosen not to return to sell to the new marketplaces. Others plan to return, but will need to raise rates to make the business more sustainable.Some of the early underpricing may have been strategic  as insurers were hoping to hook new customers with low prices and to try to keep their loyalty as prices rose. But it seems that a lot of the underpricing was a mistake, as insurers made bad estimates of how many people were likely to enter the markets in the early years and how much it would cost to pay for their medical care.Not every insurance company is losing money in the Obamacare markets, so this last factor wont affect every plan. But there is evidence that underpricing was fairly widespread, so it will affect a substantial number of them.As part of its spending deal late last year, Congress gave the insurance industry a big financial gift that should help drive down premiums. It temporarily eliminated a tax on health insurance premiums. The tax had been passed along to customers, as taxes usually are, in the form of higher prices. Experts claim that the savings should flow the other way  making price increases about 2 percent less than they would be otherwise.There are other ways the insurance plans can help keep down costs. Many have started narrowing their networks of doctors and hospitals to those they believe to be lower priced. That trend may continue and may help some insurance companies hold down price increases.Most states need to submit proposed rates to the federal government next week. But the final numbers for most states wont be clear until Nov. 1, when HealthCare.gov opens its doors for shoppers.While headlines about high prices may be right, beware of predictions that they mean Obamacare is failing. A one-year price increase does not spell doom."}
{"text": "A statue of Jesus stolen last weekend from outside the rectory of a Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn by three laughing thieves has been returned by a young man who said he found it in a nearby trash can.The SS. Peter and Paul Church in the Williamsburg neighborhood had appealed for the return of the statue on Thursday after reviewing surveillance video that showed the thieves taking it from its pedestal outside the church rectory at 71 South Third Street on April 30. In the video, a young woman wearing ballet-style flats lifts the statue off its base and tucks it under her right arm, laughing with her companions as they run away.The statue, a plaster mold, had replaced a ceramic version that was stolen from in front of the rectory in 2012 and never found.Carolyn Erstad, a spokeswoman for the Diocese of Brooklyn, said on Friday that a young man found the replacement statue in a trash can a few blocks from the rectory on the same night it was stolen. He gave it to his mother, Ms. Erstad said, but when they saw news reports and realized where the statue belonged, they called the church and returned it.The statues right hand and base were damaged, said Mother Maria Bendita, the mother superior of the Williamsburg parish to which the church belongs. It was taken for restoration to a company in Mount Kisco, N.Y., whose owner planned to give the church a new, heavier statue to put outside the rectory, she said. The older one will go inside the churchs new building, scheduled for completion in 2019, she said.The police said on Friday that there had been no arrests in the case. Mother Bendita said she would like to hear from the thieves who took it.What they did, it had consequences, she said. They stole something that was sacred for us, so wed really like to see what they have to say."}
{"text": "HONOLULU  He has called China provocative and expansionist, accusing it of creating a Great Wall of sand and clearly militarizing the disputed waters of the Western Pacific. Youd have to believe in a flat earth to think otherwise, he said in one appearance before Congress.These are the words of the American commander in charge of military operations in the Asia-Pacific region, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., who has turned heads  and caused headaches  in Beijing as well as in Washington with language starker than any coming from his commander in chief, President Obama.Admiral Harris makes no apologies for his candor, which has unsettled a more cautious White House. As China builds militarily fortified islands in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway long dominated by the United States, it is his job, he says, to talk to Congress, the American public and allies abroad about the threat.There is a natural tension between elements of the government and the chain of command, and I think its a healthy tension, he said during an interview in his office, perched high above Pearl Harbor. Ive voiced my views in private meetings with our national command authorities. Some of my views are taken in; some are not.For the Chinese, Admiral Harris, 59, is not only a tough talker. He was born in Japan, the son of a Japanese mother and an American father who was a chief petty officer in the American Navy. The Chinese have zeroed in on his ethnicity as a mode of attack.Some may say an overemphasis on the Japanese background about an American general is a bit unkind, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, wrote. But to understand the Americans sudden upgraded offensive in the South China Sea, it is simply impossible to ignore Admiral Harriss blood, background, political inclination and values.The derogatory comments had two goals, the admiral said. First, they were meant to show that the Pacific Command was disconnected from the rest of government, an idea that was completely untrue.Second, they seemed intended to tarnish him. You know when I am described as a Japanese admiral its not true. I am not sure why they have to have an adjective in front of admiral.When his family moved back to rural Tennessee, his mother refused to teach him Japanese, insisting that her son was 100 percent American. In that vein, the admiral does not make much of the fact that he is the first Asian-American to be appointed a combatant commander.That insistence on his American identity makes the Chinese comments particularly galling to him. In some respects, they try to demonize me, and thats really ugly, he said. I think in a lot of ways the communications that come out of the Chinese public affairs organ, they are tone deaf and insulting.A United Nations tribunal in The Hague is expected to rule soon on a case brought by the Philippines that could make Chinas recent fortifications on islands in the South China Sea illegal. The panel could declare Beijings claim over most of the South China Sea, which stretches from the coast of China to the beaches of Southeast Asian nations, invalid.The decision is widely expected to be unfavorable for Beijing, with potentially sharp consequences for the increasingly brittle relationship between China and the United States.How boldly China reacts to the ruling is a major concern for Admiral Harris, whose task is to recommend military options should China push forward, either in the short or longer term, with its efforts to control a waterway through which trillions of dollars in trade, including oil and gas, passes every year.Chinese military commentators have said China plans to make the Scarborough Shoal, an atoll Beijing grabbed from the Philippines four years ago, into a fortress. Only 120 miles from the Philippine coast, it would be a potential threat to an American ally. Beijing could also declare an air defense zone over parts of the South China Sea, forcing civilian airliners to make long and expensive detours to avoid risking encounters with the Chinese Air Force.The stakes are so high that Mr. Obama warned the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, during their recent meeting in Washington not to move on the Scarborough Shoal or invoke an air defense zone, said an American official who was briefed on the details of the encounter and spoke anonymously because of the diplomatic sensitivities.Neither side wants conflict over specks in the sea. But the possibility has to be considered, and Scarborough Shoal is now the place Pentagon officials say the United States might take a stand.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., recently asked Admiral Harris just that question. In a conversation overheard by a reporter while the two men chatted at the Pentagon, the admirals answer was indistinct.Asked later  war or not over the Scarborough Shoal  the admiral chuckled.It is good that my voice is low, he said, popping a Coca-Cola as he sat on a couch in his expansive office. I will say Im a military guy. I look through the lenses darkly, and thats what Im paid to do.To defend American interests, he said, I have to do it with the tools I have, and they are military tools, and they are great tools.In the China piece, we just have to be ready for all outcomes from a position of strength, Admiral Harris said, all outcomes whether it is Scarborough, South China Sea in general, or some cyberattack.He said he was worried not so much about miscalculations in the South China Sea between the Chinese military and the forces of other countries. I view them as a professional military. The bigger risk, he said, is a clash caused by Chinas paramilitary ships that could bring American forces to bear in defense of American allies.The job of a United States combatant commander  there are nine across the globe  is to serve as soldier, diplomat and an advocate of his theater to just two bosses, the president and the defense secretary.The admiral has added another facet to his job: communicator, an unusual objective for a military leader. In his commanders intent, a document he drew up last year describing his goals, he wrote, We must communicate clearly with key audiences, including allies, partners and potential adversaries.Wherever he goes, he points out that his responsibilities cover not just China but also North Korea, a pressing current danger, and beyond. From Bollywood to Hollywood, from polar bears to penguins, is how he puts it.He recently carried his message to New York City, speaking to 30 members of the Council on Foreign Relations. He met with Henry A. Kissinger (and whipped out a first edition of Mr. Kissingers Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy for an autograph).Then it was on to Malaysia to fly in an American P-8 spy plane with Malaysian defense officials, a trip intended to persuade that country to align more closely in the South China Sea dispute with the United States over its chief economic benefactor, China.After graduation from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., Admiral Harris trained as a naval flight officer. In 1991, he flew over the Persian Gulf during a naval war in which the United States sank the Iraqi Navy in 48 hours.Although most of the admirals assignments have been in Asia, he has made some detours.About a decade ago, he served as the commander at Guantnamo Bay. He studied the ethics of war at Oxford. Then came a posting as the military adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when he monitored the road map for the final status accord between Israel and the Palestinians.Harry  Thanks for traveling the world with me  Hillary reads a handwritten note on a photograph of the two of them that hangs on a wall in his office.A wall map of the South China Sea sprinkled with islands hangs to the left of his desk. Black circles show the three artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago where the Chinese have built military-capable airstrips and other assets. Admiral Harris refers to those islands as Chinese bases.Behind his desk, bookshelves are stacked with accounts of world affairs. In reading history, it is those countries with militaries who are prepared and ready that fare much better than countries that have no militaries and arent, he said.The admiral talks about how his forces must be ready to fight tonight. One of his recent reads, This Kind of War, by T. R. Fehrenbach, about the Korean War, drove that point home. He says the United States was not ready, he said. It is really a powerful book."}
{"text": "Late last month, Venezuelans lined up in droves to support a petition for a referendum that could force President Nicols Maduro out of office. Opposition leaders had a month to collect at least 200,000 signatures, the first step of a complex and lengthy process.Within a few days, they had gathered more than 1.8 million, evidence of mounting frustration in a country that is being led by an incompetent autocrat. The effort to recall Mr. Maduro, whose current term ends in 2019, has the potential to deepen the standoff between his socialist government and the opposition. It would be catastrophic if the struggle were to result in widespread violence.Venezuelas economy is expected to shrink by   8 percent this year, primarily as a result of the low price of oil. In the face of runaway inflation  which has forced Venezuelans to use large bundles of cash  and dwindling cash reserves, the government will soon be unable to afford to print more bills. Residents have been looting stores and hoarding food, anticipating that shortages of basic goods may worsen. Caracas, the capital, has become one of the most violent cities in the world. A persistent drought, meanwhile, has led to power shortages because Venezuela depends heavily on hydroelectric power.Mr. Maduro has no sound ideas for addressing the crisis, which is largely of his making; mostly he blames his governments failures on foreign conspiracies.In response the energy crisis, for instance, Mr. Maduro urged women to stop blow-drying their hair. He recently imposed a two-day workweek for public servants, arguing that keeping them home would save energy. Meanwhile, he has relied on his loyalists in the judiciary to block virtually every important measure the Parliament has passed, including financial reforms, a public housing law and a bill that would have freed political prisoners.The path to oust Mr. Maduro through peaceful and constitutional means is narrow, in large part because the president and his predecessor, Hugo Chvez, have weakened the countrys democratic institutions by doing away with term limits and packing key institutions with loyalists.Opposition leaders hope that rallying international support for their efforts can put pressure on Mr. Maduro to leave. At the Organization of American States, Secretary General Luis Almagro is expected to call for a special session in the next few weeks to debate the perilous state of democracy in Venezuela. This could force the countrys neighbors to vote on measures that could include expelling Venezuela from the diplomatic body. While expulsion is unlikely, the session could cause Venezuelas neighbors  many of whom have been publicly silent  to rebuke the Maduro government.Meanwhile, Vatican officials are considering stepping in to play a mediating role between Mr. Maduros government and the opposition. Pope Francis recently sent Mr. Maduro a letter expressing concern about the crisis, and the Vaticans top diplomat, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, is well acquainted with the political leaders in Venezuela, having been posted there from 2009 to 2013. It may be too late for international mediation to bridge the divide between the government and the opposition, but its worth trying.As opposition leaders push forward on a referendum to hold early presidential elections, they also need to articulate a plan to address the countrys problems. As long as they remain fractured and primarily defined for their loathing of the ruling party, they wont be able to end the chaos even if they succeed in ousting Mr. Maduro."}
{"text": "MANILA  A carnival-like atmosphere has descended on this country ahead of the presidential election on Monday: dancing showgirls at campaign events, candidates inviting one another to slap me, and reports of cash distributed in exchange for cheers. The Philippine system of government, inherited from our American colonizers, is unique, with its raucous collection of political parties based not on ideology but on personality.Five candidates are running for president and six more for vice president, who is elected separately. But real choice is scarce. Most politicians come from among a few dozen familiar dynasties that have ruled the country for the last two generations. The economy is booming, but corruption and cronyism, inequality and poverty remain chronic.Many Filipinos are fed up. Thats why they are turning to candidates who promise an iron fist or a return to the glory days of a dictatorial past.The front-runner for the presidency is Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking mayor of Davao, the Philippines third-largest city. He threatens to dissolve Congress and impose a revolutionary government if his reforms meet resistance. I am a dictator? Yes, it is true. he said. He also vows that if he is elected he will end crime in six months. If I fail, kill me, he said.Meanwhile, many voters have been misled by nostalgic tales of the dictatorship of Ferdinand E. Marcos, who ruled from 1965 to 1986. His son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., known as Bongbong, a senator, is leading the race for vice president and taking advantage of the short memory in a country where the median age is 23. I am a beneficiary of the good work that was done in my fathers time, said Mr. Marcos, who praises his father, the ousted strongman, as the countrys best president.The years after Philippine democracy was restored in 1986 were a time of festive optimism. My family, like many others, returned from exile abroad, excited by a new elected government and a new Constitution. But since then, the hope has faded thanks to a succession of discredited presidents and, moreover, the incompetence of a resurgent oligarchy.Of this years five presidential candidates, three are backed by the wealthy Cojuangco family, which has influenced politics for the last four decades. One candidate is the grandson of a president, another a former mayor who established a dynasty that is accused of being grossly corrupt, while the third is a neophyte senator allied with a president who was ousted for plunder.Some economists estimate that 40 of the Philippines richest families control 76 percent of gross domestic product. Senator Miriam Santiago, who promoted an unsuccessful anti-dynasty bill, said 178 dynasties ran the countrys politics, with 73 of the nations 80 provinces ruled by clans. The Center for People Empowerment in Governance, a think tank, found that roughly 80 percent of the 229 congressional seats were controlled by dynastic politicians.Its little wonder that many Filipinos now question the value of democracy.Mr. Duterte is polling 11 points ahead of his closest rival and has the support of one in three Filipinos. He presents himself as a simple man fed up with the system, vowing to fix the nation at all costs. He has been linked to more than 1,000 extra-legal executions of petty criminals during his time as mayor. Not only has he admitted to supporting the killings, he has promised that as president he will turn the 1,000 into 100,000 and dump their bodies in Manila Bay and fatten all the fish there.Mr. Dutertes campaign symbol is a fist  intended for lawbreakers, but seemingly also aimed at the oligarchy. He is the only man who offers radical change, said one of the many petitions urging him last year to run for president. The message resonates with the frustrated poor who feel let down by the government, but his fans span all classes. Mock elections at universities consistently pick him as the winner, while a chamber of commerce of wealthy Filipino-Chinese business leaders lauded him as the man who gets things done.This image as a brash, no-nonsense leader explains why nothing he says is able to damage him. He repeatedly described a rival using a homophobic slur. He called Pope Francis a son of a whore. He told human-rights groups to go to hell. He joked that he should have been first in the gang rape of an Australian missionary. Thats how men speak, Mr. Duterte explained. I am not a son of the privileged class. His supporters, who often threaten his critics on social media with death and rape threats, defended him with an offensive, but telling, rhetorical question: How can people get so upset at a rape joke when politicians have been raping the country for so long?Mr. Duterte has energized Filipinos in a historic way. One of his slogans is change is coming. Its the exactly right message from the completely wrong messenger. His and Mr. Marcoss campaigns are fueled by frustration, but other candidates offer reason and hope: Leni Robredo, a vice-presidential candidate who recently overtook Mr. Marcos, has surged thanks to her advocacy for gender equality. Walden Bello, a former student radical who is now a respected academic, has been lauded locally and internationally for his integrity and democratic activism in the Legislature.Filipinos should look to such politicians for inspiration. But they should also look to themselves. As Jose Rizal, our hero of national independence, once wrote, There are no tyrants where there are no slaves.For my whole life Ive witnessed a tendency among Filipinos to elect people who pose as saviors. We long for a disciplinarian, but meanwhile we squabble among ourselves, willingly pay bribes and flout rules. We choose candidates based on regional ties or entertaining personalities. All of us recognize that our government, dominated by an oligarchy, is severely broken  but we need to select leaders who will educate and empower us to fix it ourselves. More, real, democracy is necessary, not less.Outside the headquarters of the Philippine National Police, a sign declares: This is your police. We serve and protect. Continued, in red spray paint, is scrawled:  the ruling class. Whoever wrote it voices what so many feel. Only the people themselves can change that."}
{"text": "More than almost any other show on television, Outlander is ruled by the internal life of its female lead character. Between the occasional voice over and how her perspective shapes the shows mood and tone, Claire has proved to be the emotional anchor. Even though Jamies point of view has taken center stage in a few episodes, its Claire that guides the audience, allowing us to understand the politics and intrigue of the various worlds she moves through. Which is what makes this weeks episode, Untimely Resurrection, such a curious one.Yes, her voice over makes an appearance. Yes, her own emotional dynamics shape much of what occurs  witness how time slows to a crawl when she first sees Black Jack Randall at Versailles. Even when Ive disagreed with Claires decisions in the past I have found it almost impossible to not get swept up in her passion and at the very least understand the thoughts behind her actions. But for the first time there is something inauthentic to how certain events play out.There is a lot of time spent on political dealings. Jamie finds himself forced to work with St. Germain in an attempt to sell some wine in order to get enough money to start Prince Charless holy war in earnest. Men talk over port in offices, in brothels or on the grounds of Versailles inspecting horses as much as they do each other. But the main plot of the second season has yet to capture my interest. And for all his cunning, St. Germain has yet to prove himself to be a compelling villain. Its only in the latter half that the episode comes into focus because of Randalls reappearance.Given the predicament his younger brother, Alex, finds himself in  first being imprisoned in the Bastille, then being without a job even after the rape charges are dropped thanks to Marys letter  it was only a matter of time until Randall appeared. Ive been torn on the current chapter Outlander finds itself in. The French setting provides an intoxicating lushness particularly in the set and costume design. Yet the inner-workings of how Claire and Jamie try to undo the rebellion tend to undercut more interesting plot lines. But the gardens of Versailles provide a perfectly incongruous setting for Randalls emergence.Part way through her tense conversation with Claire, Annalise notices a dashing man that is staring rather intently. Claire searches the grounds, her eyes moving across the women in conversation until Randall comes into focus. The mood pivots abruptly. Even the score signals the darkness that unfurls as he strides toward Claire and Annalise, who quickly runs along to fetch Jamie. Among the delicate flora and ornate dresses, a war quietly rages. The fates are toying with us, Randall whispers to Claire. He delights in putting her in a precarious situation. She cant outright cross any of the very particular social boundaries of the French. She has a reputation to maintain and far greater goals even though shes seething. Another wrinkle in any sort of vengeful action? King Louis and his court are standing right behind her.Were so used to seeing Randall with the upper hand. Whether it be the way he coolly undoes Claires social graces or his outright sadism. But the French play by different rules than hes accustomed to. King Louis cleverly insults the way he speaks French while complimenting Claire, mocking his English ancestry and the bluntness of his people.I find war preferable to politics. In war at least you know your enemies, Randall counters. Its an astute observation, which even King Louis admits. It also speaks to not only the current scene but the entirety of what Claire grapples with in France. Its difficult to parse out who is truly an ally when everyone seems to have multiple facades.Jamie eventually joins the conversation. He can barely look at Randall. Beneath their casual pleasantries is an intense anger that even the King notices. When Randall states what brings him to France and Alexs predicament, King Louis notes that you cant ask a man like the Duke of Sandringham a favor. You have to beg.On your knees, King Louis says to Randall. For the first time in Outlander Randall is literally and figuratively brought to his knees. Hes laughed at, taunted, and mocked. Its an incredible reversal of fortune and a thrill to watch although in moments it seems like an oddly comical way to reintroduce such a character.Randall unsurprisingly affects the current trajectory of Claire and Jamies relationship. Jamie sets a duel (which is illegal) with Randall. Claire short circuits it by filing a false claim against Randall, accusing him of being one of the attackers that hurt Mary in the alley. Claire ruining Jamies chance at revenge in order to protect Franks future leads to an epic argument between the couple.I understand Claires loyalty toward Frank. But shes been myopic. Must I bear everyones weakness? What about my own?, Jamie asks Claire. Jamie begrudgingly agrees to spare Randall for one year. In order to save Frank she in turn sacrifices what progress her relationship with Jamie has made. How could she not foresee this? Why cant Claire and Jamie just be frank with each other instead of bringing the same sort of games theyre dealing with elsewhere into their bedroom? When he warns her do not touch me at the close of the episode, I wondered if Claire was regretting what her loyalty to Frank has cost her.Other Gossip Murtaghs sense of honor and loyalty is incredibly touching especially when set against all the conniving and con games that are playing out around him. I failed you, he says to Jamie when discussing the alley attack everyone is still reeling from. Annalise still proves to be a rather confounding figure. She also speaks of Jamie as if she has a level of ownership over him and even knows him best. When I knew him he was a boy, you turned him into a man, she says to Claire. If everyone this season, save for Murtagh perhaps, is playing their own personal confidence games, Im curious what is Annalises? There is a touching scene between Claire and Mary though that provides insight into how shes reckoning with her own assault. Mary is as fragile as a sparrows bone. Dressed in white, the only color on her the bruise across her face she seems like a ghost of her former self.Claire: How do you feel?Mary: Ashamed."}
{"text": "Art insiders are calling it a gigaweek  and indeed, the lineup of auctions next week in New York is impressive, on paper. Sothebys and Christies will go head-to-head on four successive evenings in marquee sales of Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art. In addition, Christies is offering a themed selection of contemporary works on Sunday, immediately followed by Phillipss evening auction of 20th-century and contemporary art.This crush of events is expected to raise at least $890 million. Yet the hype that attends these auctions comes as demand at the top end is contractingbecause of turbulence in the financial markets and the uncertainty of this years United States presidential race. Last May, the equivalent themed and evening contemporary sales at Christies alone brought in $1.4 billion, with Sothebys taking in $379.7 million.A sea change has occurred at auction, said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviserin New York. The night sales are smaller, the estimates more conservative, the guarantees less exuberant, the great works fewer and far between.At the moment, Ms. Cromwell added, collectors will not part with masterworks unless they are offered ridiculous sums of money.It would seem that Christies, which is privately owned by the French luxury-goods magnate Franois Pinault, is no longer willing to make that kind of offer.Last May, that auction house and third parties pledged minimum prices to the sellers of more than half of the 117 works  including a $179.4 million Picasso  in Christies evening themed and contemporary sales. (Sellers ofguaranteed works typically receive all of the hammer price and part of the buyers fees, with the auction house sometimes making a minimal profit.)This year, Christies and third parties have guaranteed just 18 of 100 lots atthat houses two headline contemporary auctions. And no work is valued at more than $40 million, at any of the houses.The guarantees arent there any more at the highest level, said Todd Levin, another art adviser based in New York. Christies has stepped back, and the market is no longer on steroids and is returning to its normal state.That said, Sothebys and Phillips are continuing to gamble on guarantees to attract art. On Wednesday night, Sothebys smaller-than-usual 44-lot salewill include 10 works that the company has guaranteed for a total of more than $70 million; last May it guaranteed five, with a total low estimate of $61 million.Amy Cappellazzo, the new chairwoman of Sothebys global fine arts division,said that some guarantees next week had been taken on by third parties.This will be the first evening New York contemporary sale Sothebys has held since paying as much as $85 million in January for the Manhattan art advisory company Art Agency, Partners, led by Ms. Cappellazzo, the former chairwoman of Christies contemporary-art department, and the highly regarded adviser Allan Schwartzman.Sothebys previous joint global heads of contemporary art, Alex Rotter and Cheyenne Westphal, and Melanie Clore, the companys worldwide co-chairwoman of Impressionist and Modern art, are among several directors who have left since that acquisition. The brain trust has been depleted, and its really affected their competitiveness, Mr. Levin said. Sothebys evening auction is about 10 lots short of what it should be.Ms. Cappellazzo said, We feel confident about the deals that have been done for May, and expect to be pleased with the results.Seats at the auction are reserved, though the live action is streamed onauction house websites. Heres what to watch for.Perhaps the title was intended to manage expectations: Bound to Fail is the latest themed auction organized by Christies deputy chairman of postwar and contemporary art, Loic Gouzer, who organized last Mays blockbuster $705.9 million Looking Forward to the Past sale.Sundays 39-lot event is estimated to raise at least $59.4 million. The auction is billed as presenting artists who have challenged the concept of fine art and commercial success.The title lot  Bruce Naumans relief of a bound torso  is a cast-iron limited-edition version of a unique 1967 sculpture that sold at auction in 2001 for $9.9 million, a sensational sum at the time. It is estimated at $6 million to $8 million.The selection of Mark Bradford to represent the United States at next yearsVenice Biennale should encourage bidding at Phillips, which is offering three works. The 12-foot-wide mixed-media canvas Building The Big White Whale, from 2012, is estimated at $3 million to $5 million. The 37-lot sale could raise at least $40.85 million, and includes 18 third-party guarantees and two company guarantees, according to Phillips.Next weeks Impressionist and Modern art auctions are conspicuously short of major-name masterworks. The standout in Sothebys 62-lot selection is Andre Derains 1906 Fauve gem, The Red Sails, valued at $15 million to $20 million.Christies postwar and contemporary auction has 61 lots, estimated to raise at least $285.6 million, with just three works carrying company guarantees. Jean-Michel Basquiats monumental 1982 painting Untitled, backed by athird party, is arguably the trophy of the week, estimated to sell for at least $40 million. The seller, the New York collector Adam Lindemann, bought itat auction in 2004 for $4.5 million.Sothebys contemporary evening sale, at 44 lots, is far smaller than last springs 63-lot auction. As in last Novembers auction, this sales most valuable lot is a 1968 Cy Twombly blackboard abstract. It is offered with a low estimate of $40 million, without a guarantee. The previous years biggerUntitled (New York City) sold for $70.5 million.Claude Monets 1919 water lily canvas, Le Bassin aux Nymphas, rates star billing at Christies evening auction of Impressionist and Modern art. This signed and dated Monet hasnt been seen at auction and is estimated at $25 million to $35 million."}
{"text": "BANGKOK  Myanmar recognizes 135 ethnic groups within its borders. But the people who constitute No. 136? They are the people-who-must-not-be-named.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmars first democratically elected government since 1962, embraced that view last week when she advised the United States ambassador against using the term Rohingya to describe the persecuted Muslim population that has lived in Myanmar for generations.Her government, like the previous military-led one, will not call the Rohingya people by that name because it does not recognize them as citizens, said her spokesman, U Kyaw Zay Ya, a Foreign Ministry official.We wont use the term Rohingya because Rohingya are not recognized as among the 135 official ethnic groups, said Mr. Kyaw Zay Ya, who was at the meeting. Our position is that using the controversial term does not support the national reconciliation process and solving problems.The stance does not bode well for the Rohingya or for rights activists who had hoped Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a  Nobel Peace Prize laureate, would reverse discriminatory policies that have marginalized the Rohingya and prompted many to flee.She is not saying anything about the Rohingya people in Myanmar and their rights to religion and education and health care, said U Aung Win, a Rohingya community leader in Rakhine State. As a Nobel Peace Prize winner, why is she so silent?The United States Embassy confirmed that the newly arrived ambassador, Scot A. Marciel, had met with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi but would not comment on their discussions.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis position on the name has taken on great significance as her party, the National League for Democracy, or N.L.D., establishes the countrys first nonmilitary government in decades. Barred by the military-drafted Constitution from serving as president, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi holds the posts of state counselor and foreign minister, among others, but she is the countrys de facto leader. The new government took over in March.The Rohingya in Myanmar, Muslims in a primarily Buddhist land, are denied basic rights, including citizenship, freedom of worship, education, marriage and freedom of travel. More than 100,000 who were driven from their homes by violence in 2012 are in resettlement camps. Many fled on dangerous sea voyages.Many nationalist Buddhists reject the name Rohingya and call them Bengalis, implying that they are interlopers from Bangladesh, a position also taken by the former military government.The United States Embassy recently drew criticism for using the word Rohingya in a statement expressing condolences for the deaths of at least 20 people whose boat capsized on April 19 off the coast of Rakhine.Nationalist Buddhists challenged the new Myanmar government to protest the Americans use of the word and staged a demonstration outside the United States Embassy in Yangon.At an April 28 news conference, Mr. Marciel responded by saying that it was standard practice around the world to let communities decide for themselves what to be called. And normally, when that happens, we would call them what they want to be called, he said. Its not a political decision; its just a normal practice.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis decision to raise the issue with Mr. Marciel the next day was an apparent concession to the extremists and was welcomed by the nationalist Association for the Protection of Race and Religion, also known as Ma Ba Tha.We dont want that word because they are not our nationality, said U Thaw Bar Ka, a leader of the group. And now I read the news that the Foreign Ministry agrees with us. Its really good. At first, I thought the new government would be useless on this issue.Rights advocates expressed disappointment that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was not willing to go against popular opinion and support a dispossessed people.Its dismaying that the new N.L.D.-led government is continuing this wrongheaded effort to police the language of Yangon-based diplomats about the Rohingya, said Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch.Mr. Kyaw Zay Ya said that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had not ordered the Americans to stop using the word or threatened consequences if they did."}
{"text": "With every bit of good fortune the Yankees have received recently, the tincture of optimism evaporated as quickly as it had arrived.After the Yankees placed Alex Rodriguez on the disabled list Wednesday with a strained right hamstring, C. C. Sabathia  somewhat surprisingly  picked up the team, resembling his former All-Star self and stifling the Baltimore Orioles for seven scoreless innings in a 7-0 win.It was, in a time of despair, a glimmer of hope.Fatefully, on Friday, Sabathia joined Rodriguez on the disabled list with a strained left groin. Then, after the first inning of the Yankees game against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, Jacoby Ellsbury exited after grabbing his hip.But amid the mounting injuries, Aaron Hicks made a winner of the Yankees by leading off the seventh inning with a home run, his first of the season. Andrew Miller escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth inning, sealing a 3-2 win and ending a tumultuous day on a positive note.My hearts still racing, Miller said.The afternoon began less fruitfully. Sabathia did not speak to reporters in the clubhouse Friday, but Manager Joe Girardi lamented that Sabathia had probably had his best outing in the past couple of years against the Orioles.It will be intriguing to see how the Yankees handle their growing list of injuries while they try to climb out of last place in the American League East. Cracks are already spider-webbing through their roster after they entered the season hoping that an aging core that included Sabathia and Rodriguez could guide them to the postseason.Sabathia turns 36 on July 21. Six days later, Rodriguez will be 41. They are injured, and they are expensive.Rodriguez is signed through the 2017 season, when he will make $21 million. Sabathia, too, could remain on the Yankees books until the end of next season  he has a vesting option for $25 million, depending on the health of his left shoulder and on whether it causes an extended or a season-ending trip to the disabled list this year.While the Yankees have long recognized the restrictions those salaries would have on any retooling of their club, their concern could grow if veteran players became more injury-prone as they played out their contracts.Girardi said Sabathia first felt pain in the fourth inning of Wednesdays game, but he did not notify the team about it until after he had finished pitching. Sabathia wanted to take a day to rest, and the team on Friday suggested a magnetic resonance imaging test.Lo and behold hes got a groin strain, Girardi said.Sabathia missed three weeks during the 2012 season with a similar injury. Girardi said he would feel fortunate if Sabathia returned as quickly this time.Girardi was also unsure about how long Rodriguezs injury would keep him out of action. After a review by the teams physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad, Girardi said that Rodriguez, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list this week, had a 1-plus strain. Grade 1 strains are typically mild or pulled muscles; Grade 2 indicates a partial muscle tear.Thats my hope, hes back in 15 days, but well have to see how he heals, Girardi said of Rodriguez.The Yankees will also watch Ellsburys progression. Girardi described Ellsbury as having a little strain on a hip muscle and classified him as day to day.After David Ortiz hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Michael Pineda, Ellsbury led off the Yankees half with a walk. He stole second and later third after a pitch by Rick Porcello got past catcher Christian Vazquez. Deciding he could not score on the play, Ellsbury forcefully stopped his momentum rounding third base, and then grabbed his right hip and leaned over.Ellsbury gingerly went home after Brian McCann hit a two-out double.As the Yankees were battling the Red Sox and dealing with injuries, they received a small lift when Aroldis Chapmans 30-game suspension under baseballs new domestic-violence policy was reduced by one game. Chapman will be eligible to pitch Monday.Before the game, Girardi, after discussing so many ailments to his team, became excited when Chapmans name was mentioned. I think it can be a lift for us and Im looking forward to him getting here, Girardi said.On Friday though, his current closer thrived under duress. The Red Sox loaded the bases with one out in the ninth. Ortiz had a 3-1 advantage on Miller, but a slider was called for strike two. Ortiz became furious, and Red Sox Manager John Farrell quickly came out of the dugout to protect Ortiz and was subsequently ejected for arguing. Farrell later said Ortiz would have needed a hockey stick to hit the pitch.Miller finished off Ortiz, who then was also ejected for continuing to argue the call. Ortiz stormed back onto the field causing a delay, but Miller struck out Hanley Ramirez to end the game.Finally, a break had gone the Yankees way.They got an infield hit, a blooper, what else do they want to go their way? Miller said. They cant have it all."}
{"text": "BANGKOK  Plans by the Malaysian government to shut down the troubled state fund at the heart of a multinational investigation could saddle the government with billions of dollars in debt and may be a first step toward a government bailout, opposition leaders said.The government announced plans this week to close the fund, which was created by Prime Minister Najib Razak and is suspected of being the source of hundreds of millions of dollars deposited in his personal bank accounts.The Finance Ministry said on Wednesday that it would absorb the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad. The ministry, which Mr. Najib oversees in his capacity as the countrys finance minister, will take over 1MDBs remaining assets.Critics are concerned that the ministry will also assume the funds estimated $6.75 billion debt, setting the stage for a government bailout.My reading is that they will take the opportunity to transfer as much of the debt as possible to the Ministry of Finance, said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament. Our fear is that the Ministry of Finance will mount a multibillion-dollar bailout of 1MDB, which is now unable to pay its debts.Government officials did not respond to requests for comment. The funds president, Arul Kanda Kandasamy, declined to discuss plans for scaling back the fund, how much it owes or the possibility of a government bailout.Malaysian officials once had high hopes for the fund, which Mr. Najib created in 2009, promising that its investments would produce significant revenue for the country. The fund had planned a $3 billion initial public offering for its energy assets as recently as last year, which could have generated even more cash.But critics say that the wealth fund was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme and that huge sums it borrowed were fraudulently diverted to well-connected insiders.At least seven countries are investigating 1MDB and numerous international bank transfers involving the fund. Swiss investigators said in January that $4 billion may have been misappropriated from 1MDB.Mr. Najibs role in establishing 1MDB as prime minister, overseeing it as finance minister, directing its advisory board and reportedly receiving money from the fund has raised many questions about his culpability.He denies any wrongdoing.In January, Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali, who had been appointed by Mr. Najib, cleared him of any crime related to the transfers of $681 million into Mr. Najibs personal bank accounts. Mr. Apandi said the money was a gift from the Saudi royal family.The Saudi Foreign Ministry  disputed that explanation in February but changed its position last month, confirming that the money was a Saudi donation.In all, Mr. Najib has banked more than $1 billion from various sources, his office has acknowledged.The moves announced on Wednesday were in keeping with recommendations by a parliamentary committee, which issued a report critical of 1MDB last month.The Foreign Ministry said that it would take over 1MDBs assets, accept the resignation of the 1MDB board effective May 31 and abolish its advisory board, which Mr. Najib had overseen.The ministry said it would appoint new members to the board to reflect the limited business profile of 1MDB.An adviser to Mr. Najib said that sales of 1MDB assets that are underway, combined with the transfer of other assets to the ministry, would leave 1MDB as a shell company without any operations. The fund will continue to service any remaining obligations, he said, but will eventually cease to exist.Mahathir Mohamed, a former prime minister and a leading critic of Mr. Najib, charged that the funds debts could bankrupt the government.The sum is so huge that if the government cannot pay them (the financiers), it could be bankrupted, he wrote in The Malaysia Chronicle on Thursday. This has happened to Greece.Mr. Mahathir also challenged the contention by Mr. Najibs allies that much of the money that the prime minister received came from a Saudi donor.None of his explanation can be believed, Mr. Mahathir said. No one would give this huge amount to anyone even if he had done something for Islam or for any other cause. The belief is that the money came from 1MDB, the only source of such sums accessible to Najib."}
{"text": "In a sharp and public escalation of its response to a raft of investigations, the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit political group tied to Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that it would refuse to comply with a subpoena issued by a New York State ethics panel.The letter, written by the groups lawyer, Laurence D. Laufer, accused the ethics panel of a blatantly political exercise in seeking further information related to possible lobbying activities.The state panel, known as the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, has been investigating the activities of the Campaign for One New York since last year over concerns, voiced by good-government groups and in the news media, that the group may have violated state regulations by acting as a lobbyist without registering as one with the state. The group registered as a lobbyist in 2014, but did not do so in 2015.In the 12-page letter, Mr. Laufer argued that Campaign for One New York did not perform any lobbying activities in 2015, and therefore was not required to register. He questioned several aspects of the investigation, its timing and its targets, noting that the panel sought information related to potential lobbying of the State Legislature, the mayor and the City Council, but not to any potential lobbying of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.We will no longer cooperate with what has obviously become a blatantly political exercise by an agency whose very independence is deeply in question, Mr. Laufer wrote in the letter, provided to reporters and addressed to the panels executive director, Seth Agata.Hours after receiving the letter, Mr. Agata suggested in a telephone interview that the panel would go to court to compel production of the documents, as early as next week.We have the option of going into court, he said, adding that regulated entities do not get to chose their regulators. We want the documents and we want them now.The letter, which provided some new details of the panels investigation, was the second time in two weeks that Mr. Laufer has accused a state investigative agency of a political motivation, amounting to a barely veiled suggestion that some of the inquiries targeting Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, in recent weeks were being orchestrated in Albany.In both instances, Mr. Laufer questioned the political motivation of leaks of information to the news media and suggested that any member of the ethics panel who shared confidential information would be guilty of a crime.Its an open threat, said Mr. Agata, who declined to address the specifics of Mr. Laufers letter, saying he could not share details of the investigation. I have one arm tied behind my back.The panels investigation began in May 2015, according to the letter, with a request to interview Bill Hyers, who managed Mr. de Blasios 2013 mayoral campaign and who helped establish the Campaign for One New York, which the mayor created to promote his agenda, the following year. The basis of the inquiry appeared to be fund-raising materials used by the group, including those that were related to school issues and would require state approval. The materials suggested to the panel a possible intent by the group to lobby in 2015, as it had done the year before.Groups are required under state law to register with the panel within 15 days if they reasonably anticipate spending more than $5,000 on lobbying activities.But Mr. Laufer argued that the investigation had gone beyond its original scope and, in seeking information about fund-raising, had drifted outside the panels jurisdiction. And he said the timing of an earlier subpoena, served in August, suggested it had been drafted sometime after an April dinner with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and just before the former executive director of the ethics panel left at the end of July to rejoin the executive branch, and therefore could have been influenced by the governors office.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomos office said that its only knowledge of the investigation is what has been reported in the news.The mayors group will continue to cooperate with investigations into other aspects of Mr. de Blasios fund-raising, by the United States attorneys office for the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan district attorneys office, Mr. Laufer said."}
{"text": "WINDSOR, Ontario  In the last year, Sergio Marchionne took a few test rides in Googles self-driving car, and he came away impressed with the speed. But it is the breathtaking pace at which the technology is advancing, not how fast the car travels, that has really grabbed his attention.Each time it got better and better, said Mr. Marchionne, the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which is now collaborating with Google. It isnt pie in the sky. People are talking about 20 years. I think we will have it in five years.Mr. Marchionne was speaking at the auto companys plant here, which is starting to make a new minivan, the Pacifica. Under the partnership unveiled this week, Fiat Chrysler will make about 100 modified Pacificas that Google will outfit with sensors and computers it has developed. The two companies will put together a joint engineering team, based in Michigan, to hone the technology.In his first public comments on Fiat Chryslers agreement with the tech giant, Mr. Marchionne acknowledged it was unclear how far their collaboration will go, or how they will share the results of their work.We are approaching this in a completely open-ended fashion, he said. We need to get to a stage where the car is viable so we can discuss the spoils of that work. We are not there yet.Others in the industry are also rushing to put autonomous vehicles on the road in real-world situations.General Motors and Lyft, the ride-hailing start-up valued at $4.5 billion, intend to test a fleet of self-driving taxis in an American city as soon as within a year, according to a person who has been briefed on the two companies plans. That would most likely begin using the technology inside the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about unannounced initiatives.G.M. and Lyft formed a partnership in January and said they planned to introduce an on-demand autonomous network of self-driving vehicles. A spokesman from G.M. and a Lyft spokeswoman declined to offer additional details about their plans.News of the taxi tests was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Until now, Fiat Chrysler had said little about its autonomous car plans. Mr. Marchionne spent much of 2015 focused not on vehicles of the future but on shaking up how cars are made today. In a blunt presentation he called Confessions of a Capital Junkie, he suggested the auto industry was headed for a crisis unless companies consolidated and stopped wasting billions of dollars to develop engines and other components that customers never touch.He then tried, without success, to persuade General Motors or other automakers to enter merger talks.Some analysts were skeptical of the agreement with Google.They are providing Google with 100 minivans, which is great, but theres not necessarily a lot of ongoing collaboration, said Karl Brauer, an analyst at the research firm Kelley Blue Book. So it remains to be seen how much work they actually do together.Other carmakers like Ford Motor and Audi have made no secret of spending millions of dollars to create driverless cars, usually with the idea of heading off any competitive threat that could come from driverless cars being developed by Google and its Silicon Valley rival, Apple. Some have tried to recast themselves as mobility companies that will provide the means of moving people around, whether by cars they own, rent or hail via an app.On Friday, Mr. Marchionne said the mobility concept was a lofty ideal.He also said he was not imagining a merger with Google, although he was counting on the tech giant to help Fiat Chrysler catch up in driverless car technology. We will be walking in a collaborative fashion with them at their speed, he said. We are exploring with them to allow us into their world.He also said that rival automakers working on their own autonomous cars, in competition with Google, were taking a risk that their investments may not pan out.Its too early in this process to make the call who is going to end up with the winning solution, Mr. Marchionne said. Precluding development with others is a very dangerous bet."}
{"text": "ROME  Pope Francis, receiving a prize for service toward European unification on Friday, urged leaders to remember the ideals of the European Unions founders, calling for an update of the idea of Europe at a time of mass migration, economic sluggishness and fears about terrorism.The past can serve as an inspiration to confront with courage the complex multipolar framework of our own day, and to take up with determination the challenge of updating the idea of Europe, the pope told European leaders in the Sala Regia at the Vatican, where he was awarded the Charlemagne Prize, named for the ninth-century king of the Franks who became Holy Roman Emperor.A Europe capable of giving birth to a new humanism based on three capacities: the capacity to integrate, the capacity for dialogue and the capacity to generate, he said.Francis was selected as this years recipient for reiterating values central to Europe: solidarity, compassion, tolerance and respect for others, as well as for his message of peace and understanding. You are the pope of hope for all of us, Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said at Fridays ceremony.The accolade  officially the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, the German city where Charlemagne died and is buried  was first awarded in 1950. Its organizers describe it as the oldest and best-known prize awarded for work done in the service of European unification.Past recipients include Winston Churchill, Bill Clinton, Henry A. Kissinger, Vaclav Havel and Pope John Paul II, who won an extraordinary Charlemagne Prize in 2004.As in his 2014 address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Francis raised his concern that Europe was flagging in its commitment to a common vision.What has happened to you, the Europe of humanism, the champion of human rights, democracy and freedom? the pope asked on Friday. What has happened to you, Europe, the mother of peoples and nations, the mother of great men and women who upheld, and even sacrificed their lives for, the dignity of their brothers and sisters?Those questions have become more pressing in recent years as the vision of political and economic unity has clashed with the realities of an economic downturn, threats of terrorism and the largest movement of migrants since World War II on an unprepared Continent. Populist politics, often tinged with an anti-European message, is also wearing down the desire of many European leaders to arrive at a shared response to these pressing issues.Faced with the difficulties of the present, the pope challenged Europes leaders to revive the de facto solidarity and concrete generosity that followed the Second World War, and to recognize that the identity of Europe is, and always has been, a dynamic and multicultural identity that today requires a profound cultural integration.The soul of Europe is, in fact, greater than the present borders of the Union and is called to become a model of new syntheses and of dialogue, the pope told the audience, which included leaders of the European Unions principal institutions and its central bank, as well as elected officials including Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The true face of Europe is seen not in confrontation, but in the richness of its various cultures and the beauty of its commitment to openness, he said.He also called on leaders to put in place more inclusive and equitable economic models, aimed not at serving the few, but at benefiting ordinary people and society as a whole. And the pope asked them to develop better opportunities for Europes youth, who are stymied by record-high unemployment rates and face pressures to emigrate.We cannot look to the future without offering them the real possibility to be catalysts of change and transformation, he said. We cannot envision Europe without letting them be participants and protagonists in this dream.Francis urged leaders to refer to the Continents founding fathers, who dared to change radically the models that had led only to violence and destruction.They dared to seek multilateral solutions to increasingly shared problems, he said.Finally, the pope shared his dream for Europe: a Europe that cares for children, that offers fraternal help to the poor and those newcomers seeking acceptance because they have lost everything and need shelter.In his Europe, being a migrant is not a crime but a summons to greater commitment on behalf of the dignity of every human being; young people live a simple life undefiled by the insatiable needs of consumerism; and getting married and having children is a responsibility and a great joy, not a problem due to the lack of stable employment.I dream of a Europe that promotes and protects the rights of everyone, without neglecting its duties towards all, he said. I dream of a Europe of which it will not be said that its commitment to human rights was its last utopia."}

{"text": "HAVANA  Idania Wambrug teaches dance in a capacious, brick-vaulted studio with so much light streaming down from high windows that it almost feels like an outdoor pavilion. Its the same studio where she was a student in the 1960s, and over the years, all that natural light has been helpful when the electricity has gone out.The studio is in the National School of Dance here in Havana, part of the National Arts Schools, an avant-garde architectural project conceived not long after the 1959 Cuban Revolution but never completed. What Ms. Wambrug teaches comes from that time as well. With a mandate from the revolutionary government, the Cuban choreographer Ramiro Guerra created tcnica cubana, a hybrid of American modern dance  the language of Martha Graham, Jos Limn and others, which Mr. Guerra had studied in the United States  with ballet and Cuban tradition, both Spanish and African.For a dance-cognizant visitor from the United States, watching a class in tcnica cubana is heady: very familiar and then suddenly not, as torsos contracting in Graham style turn ultra-sinuous, ultra-African, or a standard ballet exercise swerves into the gestures of an Afro-Cuban god. Yet the alloy is coherent and potent. Its a great, under-recognized invention that develops dancers of extraordinary strength with the agility to manage all of its wild twists.Still, tcnica cubana can seem rather like the 1950s Chevys famously still cruising Cubas streets: gorgeous, miraculously maintained, way behind the times. (Cuban ballet, better known and also better funded by the state, is even more trapped in amber.) Information about dance, in the form of videos or visiting choreographers, is easier than automobiles to get through a blockade, but traces of developments in American modern dance from the last 40 or 50 years, though present, are scarce here.[ Read about Cuban ballets proud past and promising future ]Like everything else in Cuban-American relations, that may now be changing. And the dance-maker taking the most advantage of the changes is Osnel Delgado, Ms. Wambrugs son.Mr. Delgado studied tuition-free at the National School of Dance, as did both his parents and as do most professional modern dancers in Cuba, unless they train at one of the islands excellent ballet schools. After he graduated, he joined Danza Contempornea de Cuba, the countrys foremost modern dance troupe, founded by Mr. Guerra in 1959. In 2011, the company made its first United States tour. Mr. Delgados performance at the Joyce Theater in New York was a moment of triumph, but at 25 he had already decided to break off on his own as a choreographer. Everyone told him he was making the wrong move.On Tuesday, he returns to the Joyce  for the third time in three consecutive years  with his own company. Its called Malpaso, which in Spanish means misstep. His wrong move came at the right time.What Obama and our president just did, Malpaso has been doing for a while, Mr. Delgado said after a recent rehearsal in Havana, just a month after President Obamas visit. He and Malpaso were back home after a busy spring touring the United States. Soon they head north again for more tour dates, a schedule no other Cuban troupe can match.When Mr. Delgado first formed Malpaso with Fernando Saez, a friend and a savvy administrator with the Ludwig Foundation, they applied for government funding. When they were told it was unavailable, they went ahead anyway, becoming one of very few Cuban troupes not reliant on government money.When the Joyce sent the renowned American choreographer Ronald K. Brown to Havana in 2013 to create a work for a Cuban troupe of his choosing, Mr. Brown picked Malpaso. The piece he made shared a program with one by Mr. Delgado at the fledgling companys United States debut, at the Joyce the following year.The year after that, Malpaso returned to the Joyce with a new dance by another prominent American choreographer, Trey McIntyre. Now its bringing Bad Winter, an older work that the smitten Mr. McIntyre has presented to Malpaso as a gift.Partly a fluke of timing, this engagement with the United States has become central to Malpasos mission, setting it apart from other Cuban troupes, of which there are a surprising number. It offers American presenters something Cuban along with something more familiar, as Mr. Delgado and his dancers absorb American influences.For decades, the main outside influence on Cuban dance has come from Europe. That can be seen in DanzAbierta, a troupe that will make its New York debut on May 14, following Malpaso in the Joyces 12-day festival of Cuban dance. Marianela Boan, who founded DanzAbierta in 1988 and who has since moved to the Dominican Republic, believed in what she called contaminated dance and drew heavily on European dance-theater, like that of Pina Bausch.Her aesthetic has been furthered by Susana Pous, a Spanish choreographer who has directed DanzAbierta since 2008. Her works, collaborations with Cuban visual artists and musicians, are, she said, about the problems of Cuban life, more than just pretty dance. Many of Ms. Pouss pieces  like Showroom, which DanzAbierta is bringing to the Joyce  address and resist exotic stereotypes of Cuban dancers still promulgated by tacky tourist cabarets.An ambivalence about Cubas dance heritage is expressed more intensely in the choreography of George Cspedes, one of Danza Contemporneas most prolific homegrown talents. His recent pieces seem to tamp down on the dancers virtuosity and sensual pleasure, to be about a Cuban body struggling within a dour, oppressive conceptualism.In person, hes refreshingly frank. While many Cubans respond to questions about how Cuba is changing by rolling their eyes, Mr. Cspedes says that maybe his grandchildren will see change. Having started an independent company three years ago, hes trying to get back into the government-funded system. Its too hard, he says, to survive outside.Mr. Delgado, whose company is surviving and who may find a different path forward through American models, is somewhat concerned about Cuban dance losing its identity  buffeted by European influences and now by the coming flood of tourist money and what kind of dance that might encourage. He can sound a lot like a modern-dance choreographer in New York (who would envy his free dance education and health care): pining for a bigger audience, longer runs and a permanent space to work. He wishes he had a place to host a choreographic lab, which we really need in Cuba, he said.The most recent policy changes announced by the Obama administration mean that presenters in the United States, previously restricted to providing only travel expenses and per diems, will soon be allowed to pay Cuban companies like Malpaso to perform. But this improvement has already generated controversy about how the Cuban government may tax that income  one of many examples of the bewildering legal and economic limbo in which a group like Malpaso has to operate.Meanwhile, Mr. Delgado is doing what modern choreographers do, trying to develop his own way of saying what he has to say. A ballet class is part of Malpasos everyday training, but not any classes in tcnica cubana. That technique is our base, my blood he said, but we dont dance like that.Recently, many of the Malpaso dancers gathered in a restaurant that one of them had opened, a source of income that would have been unlikely before restrictions loosened in 2010. With them was Isidro Rolando, a man with five decades of experience as a dancer, teacher and choreographer for Danza Contempornea. He taught Mr. Delgados parents. He recalled the importance of the company in establishing the legitimacy of Afro-Cuban culture. We created things of value, he said ruefully, but they will probably disappear.Mr. Delgado rose from his chair and physically quoted a bit of Mr. Rolandos choreography. His attitude was respectful and affectionate, but it didnt contradict what Mr. Rolando had said."}
{"text": "Updated, 8:58 p.m. | Donald J. Trump is opening a line of attack on Bill and Hillary Clinton, focusing on the former presidents impeachment and the Democratic presidential hopefuls treatment of her husbands accusers.At rallies on Saturday in Eugene, Ore., on Friday and in Spokane and Lynden, Wash., on Saturday, Mr. Trump suggested that the Clintons were not in a position to question his treatment of women.There was nobody that was worse, nobody than Bill Clinton, with women, Mr. Trump told the crowd in Spokane.Shes married to a man who was impeached for lying, Mr. Trump said of Mrs. Clinton. He was impeached for lying about what happened with a woman. And shes gonna take ads about little Donald Trump? I dont know. I dont think so.Describing Mrs. Clinton as an enabler, he added, Some of these women were destroyed, not by him, but by the way that Hillary Clinton treated them after everything went down.Over the years, some people close to the Clintons have described Mrs. Clinton asinvolved in efforts to discredit a string of women who made accusations against Mr. Clinton, going back to his days as a governor of Arkansas. Mrs. Clintons allies see the issue as being pushed by Republicans looking to revive issues that have long been dormant, or that have been litigated publicly in the past.But Mr. Trump and some of his advisers believe that some younger voters are unfamiliar with those sagas, and will be troubled by them when they learn the details. The risk for Mr. Trump is that voters may rally around Mrs. Clinton if he raises the subject.Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clintons campaign, said in an email: In a week in which Donald Trump casually suggested destabilizing the entire U.S. economy and cited his attendance at the Miss Universe pageant in Russia as proof of his foreign policy experience, of course he wants to try to change the subject.Hillary Clinton doesnt care what he says about her, he continued. She will continue to call him out for his outrageous positions and divisive comments.Democrats have made clear that they plan to resurrect in ads Mr. Trumps comments over the years, including those on the Howard Stern radio show, belittling women for their appearance. In polls, Mr. Trump is facing negative ratings with women, largely over such comments.Mr. Trump said Saturday that some of his comments about women were simply entertainment, adding two can play that game.He also spoke about his well-publicized feud with Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor, that began after she questioned him about his treatment of women at the first Fox News debate.The following day, Mr. Trump told a CNN host that Ms. Kelly had blood coming out of her eyes and blood coming out of her wherever, a reference that many took to refer to menstruation.Mr. Trump insisted that only dirty-minded people took it that way, and that no one respects women more than he does.He noted that his displeasure with Ms. Kelly, with whom he has since made peace, had started after she questioned him for being critical of Rosie ODonnell, whom he once called a fat pig.Who the hell wouldnt speak badly about Rosie ODonnell? he asked the crowd.Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton is playing the woman card and that she would have zero chance of winning without that. Men, he said, are petrified to speak to women anymore.The women get it better than we do, folks, alright? he added.In Lynden, speaking before a massive American flag at a fairground, he also attacked Mrs. Clinton on a range of other issues, including her trigger happy foreign policy, ties to Wall Street and affinity with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been jousting with Mr. Trump on Twitter.He included a new, if factually incorrect, criticism of Mrs. Clinton on gun rights, claiming she wants to abolish the Second Amendment.She wants to take the bullets away, Mr. Trump said.Mrs. Clinton has campaigned on creating new gun control legislation, but has never said or inclined that she would abolish the Second Amendment."}
{"text": "It has not yet been seen on television, but the early notices for a digital advertisement from a Democratic candidate for the Senate from Arkansas, Conner Eldridge, suggest it could well become a blueprint for how other Democrats  incumbents and challengers alike  attack their Republican opponents by linking them to Donald J. Trump.THE AD Highlighting some of Mr. Trumps most misogynistic remarks, the ad alternates between those quotations and slowly spelling out the definition of the ads title: Harassment.A white, blinking cursor on a black screen begins to peck out a dictionarys entry for harassment, before the screen cuts to video and audio clips of Mr. Trump: She ate like a pig. Id look her right in that fat ugly face of hers. The cursor continues typing the definition  To subject someone to hostility  before cutting again to the voice of Mr. Trump opining about a womans cosmetic surgery: The boob job is terrible.This continues for a full minute before the cursor blinks ahead of a new phrase: Trump enabler: Arkansas Senator John Boozman, who is shown in a black-and-white photo as he is heard saying he will support the Republican nominee, regardless of who we pick, even if it is Mr. Trump.THE IMPACT The two-minute ad was instantly seen as a preview of general-election attacks on down-ballot Republican candidates with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket. It received even more attention on the right than on the left: This is brutal, wrote Erick Erickson, a conservative writer who opposes Mr. Trumps candidacy. He called it a road map for how Democrats are going to take back the Senate.THE TAKEAWAY Mr. Trumps victory in the primary campaign has created a sense of worry and uncertainty for lower-level Republican candidates, unsure if he will drag them down or if they will need to hold onto his avid supporters to have a chance in November. The threat contained in this ad  effectively using Mr. Trumps and Mr. Boozmans own voices against them  could well prompt some Republicans to try to distance themselves from their presumptive nominee. Either way, it provides a warning: Every vow to support the Republican standard-bearer  normally a routine statement, not a fraught one  may now be turned into a Democratic cudgel.One of Senator Ted Cruzs final commercials sought to tie Mr. Trump to Hillary Clinton, calling them two sides of the same coin on tax increases, guns and transgender bathrooms. But something seemed off: It showed Mr. Trumps and Mrs. Clintons profiles on a spinning gold coin  the sort ordinarily reserved for esteemed former presidents. Then again, at least the ad reflected Mr. Cruzs desire to return to a gold standard.NextGen Climate, a super PAC run by Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager turned environmentalist, released a 30-second ad showing Mr. Cruz dismissing climate change as not science and Mr. Trump calling global warming a hoax. But in the ads second half, Mr. Steyer, a Democrat, faces the camera in blue shirt sleeves, with rolling green hills behind him  classic Im a candidate staging. He urges people concerned about climate change to vote, without saying for whom. But the healthy face time could help make him a more familiar figure in California, where he is said to be considering a run for governor.Mrs. Clinton and her allies were ready when Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee. Both her campaign and Priorities USA released digital ads mocking his promise to be a unifier. One showed other Republicans calling Mr. Trump a con artist, phony, bully and more, with Jeb Bush saying Mr. Trump needed therapy. Another repurposed Mr. Trumps own unifier audio over video showing violence and protests at his rallies.$2.8 million: Total spent in Indiana by Mr. Cruzs campaign and a super PAC supporting him.$2.6 million: Amount spent in Indiana by super PACs opposing Mr. Trump.$900,000: Amount spent in Indiana by the Trump campaign."}
{"text": "One evening in December 1989, John Gotti had a conversation with his acting underboss, Frank Locascio, about murdering a troublesome underling in the Gambino crime family who had failed to show up to a meeting.Louie DiBono, Mr. Gotti said. You know why hes dying? Hes gonna die because he refused to come in when I called. He didnt do nothing else wrong.Mr. Locascio predicted Mr. DiBono would be bringing Mr. Gotti a large sum of cash the next day. But I wouldnt take nothing, the crime boss answered, affirming in colorful language that Mr. DiBonos days were numbered.That taped conversation, along with the testimony of the familys third-in-command, Salvatore (Sammy the Bull) Gravano, was enough to convict Mr. Locascio of conspiring to murder Mr. DiBono, who met his end violently in a parking garage 10 months later. Mr. Locascio received a life sentence for murder and racketeering.For years, Mr. Locascio, who is 83, has insisted that he tried to talk Mr. Gotti out of killing Mr. DiBono. He claims he tried to broker a deal that Mr. DiBono would pay Mr. Gotti $50,000 to make peace.And he contends the same audiotapes used to convict him, if enhanced with modern digital techniques, would prove he is right. Many of his words are inaudible during the conversation with Mr. Gotti, swallowed up in music and background noise.Having exhausted his other avenues of appeal, Mr. Locascio is now locked in a legal battle with the federal government over access to two of the tapes, which were sealed by Judge I. Leo Glasser in 1998. He has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in Washington seeking to force the Federal Bureau of Investigation to hand over the tapes so his audio expert may analyze them with digital tools.He faces more than legal obstacles. Justice Department lawyers said in February that the original seven inch reel-to-reel recordings made by F.B.I. agents had been damaged beyond repair when Hurricane Sandy flooded the agencys storage facility in New Jersey. In court papers, the Justice Department has also said officials searched the 151 boxes of records from the trial and could not find copies of the two tapes Mr. Locascio is seeking.Even if undamaged copies of the recordings are located, the Justice Department contends it does not have to release them under the FOIA, according to court papers. Though the tapes were played in court and the transcripts have been published in a book, they are now under seal and are no longer in the public domain, the government argued in court filings.Complicating matters, F.B.I. officials in Washington handed over a redacted copy of one of the tapes on a compact disc in late March, only to ask for it back a few days later, saying they had made a mistake. On Monday, prosecutors went into Federal District Court in Brooklyn and asked Judge Glasser to order Mr. Locascios lawyers to return the CD.The suit is the latest in a long series of unsuccessful attempts by Mr. Locascios lawyers to get a new trial. Judge Glasser and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit have repeatedly upheld his conviction  five times.In 2011, Judge Glasser also rejected Mr. Locascios request to unseal the tapes, noting that his lawyers were given copies of the original recordings at trial. The judge said he had ruled against Mr. Locascio at trial when he tried to call on an audio expert to interpret the tapes for the jury. That ruling still stood, he wrote.This is a thinly disguised effort to re-litigate a ruling made during the trial upon which Locascio and his counsel can only be described as fixated, he wrote.Mr. Locascios lawyer, Ruth M. Liebesman, said Mr. Locascio should be able to analyze the original tapes with modern audio techniques, just as other defendants have been allowed to re-examine old DNA evidence with advanced technology. Why shouldnt we be able to do that with tapes as well? she said.The recordings were made with a bug placed in an older womans apartment above the Ravenite Social Club on Mulberry Street in Little Italy in Manhattan, where Mr. Gotti held court. The jury never heard the original reel-to-reel recordings. Copies were made on cassettes, and the originals were put back in the F.B.I.s safe at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, an agent, George Gabriel, testified.The agent also testified the tapes had not been enhanced or altered before the jury heard them, a contention Mr. Locascios audio expert disputes.Even if Mr. Locascio obtains the original tapes and can tease out a clearer recording of his words by digitally filtering out distortion and background noise, he is unlikely to persuade the courts to grant him a new trial. For starters, Mr. Gravano testified that no murders were committed without the agreement of both Mr. Gotti and Mr. Locascio.The jury also seemed to be persuaded by an F.B.I. agents testimony that the December 1989 conversation between Mr. Gotti and Mr. Locascio showed the decision to kill Mr. DiBono had already been made, and no payment he might make would change the plan. Judge Glasser highlighted this point in a 2005 opinion denying Mr. Locascio a new trial.In a 2011 affidavit supporting his request to unseal the tapes, Mr. Locascio remembered things differently. It is my clear recollection that, after telling Gotti that I predict that hes going to bring you fifty, I told Gotti, in sum and substance, to take the money and forget about his anger with DiBono, he said, adding: I had nothing to do with the DiBonos murder.For Mr. Locascio, time is growing short. Had he been convicted only of racketeering, the maximum sentence would have been 20 years and he would now be free. But the murder conviction means he will die in prison, just as John Gotti did in 2002.Mr. Locascio is incarcerated in a prison hospital, the Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayer, Mass. To pay legal bills, his family has sold an upstate horse farm he owned. He uses a wheelchair, has emphysema and cannot stand on his own. Most days, Mr. Locascio maintains an old street toughs optimism about his chances of release, despite the long odds, his nephew, also named Frank Locascio, said. Other days are darker.I only heard him down in one visit, his nephew said. He was saying Im the little fish in the fish tank and the waters evaporating."}

{"text": "The attention-grabbing news this week from a lawsuit between Penn State University and its insurer was the disclosure by the judge that the universitys former football coach, Joe Paterno, may have been told in 1976 that Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant coach, had molested a child.Before the judges order was reported Thursday night, even Paternos harshest critics could not point to any evidence that the legendary Penn State coach had known about Sanduskys widespread sexual abuse of minors before 1998  13 years before the scandal broke.But the bigger news for Penn State may have been elsewhere in the opinion, where the judge, Gary Glazer of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, rejected the universitys argument that its insurer was obligated to cover all of the nearly $100 million in settlements the university has paid to 32 of Sanduskys accusers.Rather, Glazer concluded that instances of abuse after 1999 would be subject to trial. He found that the insurer would be responsible for paying settlements reached for instances of abuse before 1992. He also found that the insurer was not responsible for claims stemming from abuse between 1992 and 1999  which accounted for many of the claims, according to Tom Kline, a lawyer for one victim who settled.The ruling, on motions for a partial summary judgment, could have significant financial consequences for Penn State. The university may fail to recoup tens of millions of dollars in settlement funds it has already paid out  money that officials of the public university had previously insisted will not be funded by student tuition, taxpayer funds or donations, but rather by insurance.Penn State had depended during the litigation on the insurance coverage, so its a very significant setback for the university, Kline said.In his ruling this week, Glazer found that an exemption written into many of Penn States annual policies since 1992 eliminated the insurers obligations, particularly because Penn State apparently did not notify the insurer of the potential for claims in a timely fashion.By cloaking him with a title that enabled him to perpetrate his crimes, wrote Glazer, referring to Sandusky, P.S.U. must assume some responsibility for what he did both on and off campus.Or, as Kline put it: Their failure to report what Paterno and others knew cost them millions in payments to the victims, and the same knowledge and failure to report cost them millions in insurance coverage.Penn State has already paid out the $92.8 million in settlements, according to Kline. It also paid a $60 million fine as part of a punishment levied by the N.C.A.A. and spent nearly $30 million more over two years on internal legal and investigative costs, according to a 2015 audit.The revelation on Page 2 of the opinion that in 1976, a child allegedly reported to P.S.U.s Head Football Coach Joseph Paterno, that he (the child) was sexually molested by Sandusky could upend the public understanding of the case. Until now, the widely (though not universally) accepted record has been that Paterno and other university officials were not aware of allegations against Sandusky until 1998 or 2001, after which time most, though not all, of Sanduskys victims said they had already been abused.We note the courts opinion states the alleged incidents are based upon the deposition testimony of persons who claim to have been victims of Jerry Sandusky, Penn State said in a statement Friday. We note these are allegations, and not established fact. The university has no records from the time to help evaluate the claims. More importantly, Coach Paterno is not here to defend himself.Paterno died in January 2012, only a few months after the Sandusky scandal came to light. Later that year, Sandusky, now 72, was convicted of sexually abusing 10 boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.Paternos staunchest supporters have insisted that even the narrative that Paterno had been aware of an allegation against Sandusky in 1998  the conclusion reached by the Freeh Report, a university-commissioned investigation which Penn State has since come to question  overstated Paternos knowledge regarding the man who had been his top defensive assistant for three decades.In his ruling, Glazer also cited three other reports of molestation: one in 1987, witnessed by an assistant coach in a university facility; another in 1988, witnessed by a different assistant coach; and a third in 1988, which was referred to the athletic director.Yet Glazer found that the annual policies before 1992 between Penn State and its insurer, Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association Insurance, did not appear to absolve the insurer from covering Sandusky-related claims.A spokeswoman for the insurance company declined to comment Friday.But Glazer found that between 1992 and 1999, a specific Abuse or Molestation Exclusion in Penn States annual policies meant that the insurance did not apply to the negligent employment or retention of an abuser such as Sandusky.Moreover, an expected or intended exclusion in insurance policies beginning in 1998 suggested to Glazer that the insurers responsibility for claims stemming from those years is a subject for trial, because Gary C. Schultz, then a senior vice president, and Graham B. Spanier, then the Penn State president, having known of an allegation against Sandusky (according to the Freeh Report), should have understood the threat he posed.In 1998 and 2001, wrote Glazer, it was common knowledge, unfortunately, that sexual predators are repeat offenders.Glazer found that Schultz and Spanier failed to take proper action as Penn States executive officers.Schultz and Spanier should have contacted the authorities, obtained help for the children abused, and otherwise acted to prevent him from having future contact with children, Glazer said, referring to Sandusky. Instead, they apparently chose to sweep the problem under the rug."}
{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore.   As his team gathered for practice Friday morning, Terry Stotts, the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, cited one of the luxuries of the N.B.A.s protracted playoff schedule: more time to study game tape.But with three full days to digest his teams most recent loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals, Stotts did not have to make many hard choices about whether to cue up all the good stuff his players had done Tuesday in Game 2 or let them study everything that had gone wrong. The Trail Blazers had plenty of time for both.On Thursday, Stotts chose to dig into the fourth-quarter breakdowns  all the missed shots, turnovers and defensive miscues that had allowed the Warriors to escape with a 110-99 win. On Friday, Stotts focused more on the first three quarters  all the crisp passes and cohesive plays that had put the Blazers in control before everything went sour.For the most part, we did a lot more good things than not, Stotts said. So reinforcing the positives and showing them what needs to be done is probably more effective.The Trail Blazers, facing a 2-0 series deficit ahead of Game 3 on Saturday at Moda Center, are in some trouble, but at least they have survived similar situations in the not-so-distant past. In the first round, they fell into a 2-0 hole against the Los Angeles Clippers before winning the final four games of the series. Granted, the Trail Blazers benefited from the injury-induced absences of the Clippers Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, but they still had to win high-pressure playoff games.To be sure, Portland has thrived as an overlooked, overachieving team that had to reassemble the pieces after losing four starters to off-season moves last summer.C. J. McCollum, the teams starting shooting guard, recalled some of the familiar narratives: Were not supposed to win a lot of games. Were not supposed to make the playoffs.So the teams current predicament feels like more of the same.We feel good, the reserve guard Gerald Henderson said. Weve left the last two games behind us.The Warriors will once again be without Stephen Curry, who did not play in the first two games of the series because of a sprained right knee. On Friday, Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach, ruled him out of Game 3 and indicated there was a small chance he could play Monday in Game 4.I think theyre an elite team with or without Steph, the Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard said. Obviously, with him, they go to a new level. But nothing ever changes for me. Im going to be my same self regardless of whos out there. Im going to go out there and attack and try to help my team win the game.Lillard pointed to some of the series odd dynamics. From the start of the second quarter of Game 1 through the end of the third quarter of Game 2, the Trail Blazers actually outscored the Warriors by 17 points. But the first quarter of Game 1 and the fourth quarter of Game 2 were unmitigated disasters for Portland.Here in the old N.B.A., its four quarters, Henderson said. Weve got to sustain our play for the whole game.On Tuesday, the Warriors went into the fourth quarter trailing by 11 and outscored the Trail Blazers by 34-12 the rest of the way. Lillard finished with 25 points but missed all three of his field-goal attempts in the fourth quarter. His takeaway from Thursdays film session?Hesitation, Lillard said. We just werent sure of that same play. As the game tightened up, it kind of seemed like we were having second thoughts about making the simple plays that we had already made.The general takeaway was that the Trail Blazers have reason to believe they can compete with the Warriors, that their game plan and defense are solid. Stotts observed how his players had limited the Warriors to eight 3-pointers in Game 2, a modest total for them.We played three-and-a-half very good quarters, Stotts said. When all is said and done, its a tie game with four or five minutes to go, on the road, against Golden State. You want to be in that position.But even without Curry, the Warriors are in firm control. If the Trail Blazers were to advance past them, it would be vaguely comparable to Leicester City taking the Premier League title.Theyre historically good, Stotts said. Theres no denying that. And I know theyve had critics, for whatever reason. But I dont think you can deny what theyve done over the last two years.Henderson was asked to compare the Warriors to other great teams he had faced in his career. Were they the best he had seen?If I thought that, I probably wouldnt tell you that today, he said. Maybe at the end of the series.The challenge for the Trail Blazers is figuring out a way to prolong it."}
{"text": "Nothing says I love you like a life-size 3-D model of yourself. But if Mothers Day passes on Sunday without a $30,000 version of your likeness arriving at her door, fear not: Perhaps its a good idea for Fathers Day.Just kidding. But not really.A company in Alabama was offering to make an actual, life-size replica of a person, thanks to an enormous 3-D printer, for the cool price of $30,000. That is not, however, their normal business strategy.We do more of industrial things, said Renato Gross, the president of SWIGRO, the company offering the deal.Mr. Gross said he was approached by Groupon about the idea, which has generated a desirable amount of attention.It has been all over the news, Mr. Gross said.But that does not mean its a prank. Mr. Gross said the company is capable of printing a person-sized model with a great level of detail.A full scan of the persons body would be necessary  the Groupon offer included travel and lodging  and creating the final product would take about a week, Mr. Gross said.Were always looking for unique, bespoke experiences that we can offer exclusively for Groupon customers, Bill Roberts, vice president of global communications for Groupon, said in an email.Last year, the company offered a surrogate son (also completely legit, Mr. Roberts said) that promised 16 hours of enthusiastic obedience and doting on your mother for the holiday.But what mothers want the most, according to a survey of about 4,500 women by Influenster, a product discovery website, are gifts that pamper them. And the idea that homemade creations are cherished may not be true.D.I.Y. gifts werent really rated that highly, said Elizabeth Scherle, the president and co-founder of Influenster.Flowers werent rated highly either, but plenty of people were still planning to send them, based on a survey by the National Retail Federation.Influenster also found that, at least among young mothers, the person they most wanted gifts from was their spouse.Good luck out there."}
{"text": "LONDON  Conferences can be a little niche, but most dont aim to stultify.Not so the Boring Conference, a daylong showcase of talks on deliberately dull topics. First staged in London in 2010, the conference is set to take place here again on Saturday, May 7. According to its website, tickets are sold out.This years participants include Eleanor Herring, a historian who will discuss the history of lampposts, and Jason Ward, a jigsaw-puzzle aficionado who will assemble a puzzle at the conference throughout the day.James Ward (no relation to Jason), who works for a small public relations agency, conceived the event after the organizer of the Interesting conference, dedicated to interesting but nonutilitarian pursuits, announced that it would not take place in 2010.So, James Ward, who also runs a blog called I Like Boring Things, posted a knee-jerk response on Twitter saying that he would start a boring conference, he said in a phone interview. Responses quickly began piling up, and an idea that had started out as an idle tweet became something Id have to do for real.As the conferences website notes Mr. Ward, 35, is the author of Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencil Case, a book that was awarded two out of five stars by The South China Morning Post.The conference format has evolved through the years, as Mr. Ward has aimed for the right blend of actual dullness and enigmatic intrigue.Theres a sort of constant refinement of what the conference should actually showcase he said, noting that some early participants verged too far into the actual doldrums.Having people with genuine interests in obscure or overlooked areas has worked best, he said. (Setting time limits on their presentations has also helped, he noted).Past participants include Tim Steiner, a hand-dryer enthusiast who has a Dyson Airblade installed in his house, and a 7-year-old boy who likes elevators. Both lectured on their interests. Peter Fletcher, who kept a yearslong record of each of his sneezes, appeared at the first conference to discuss his project.He writes down the time, the date, where he was, what he was doing and a measure of strength, Mr. Ward said of the sneeze project. To me thats always been the kind of archetypal boring talk.Technology allowing, conference organizers will livestream the jigsaw-puzzle event, Mr. Ward said. People around the world can follow the progress of a man doing a jigsaw puzzle for seven hours, which will be very exciting, he said, adding, Im sure it will set the Internet alight."}

The council voted, 12 to 0, to move forward with the 22,000-seat stadium on the site of the old Sports Arena next to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the University of Southern California. The Sports Arena, which was once home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, will be torn down to make way for the new complex.

Spurs collected nine yellow cards and there was a mass melee after the final whistle, involving players and coaches from both teams.

{"text": "Mardi Gras morning was difficult at the Cupcake Cafe.The health inspector showed up, and Ruth Arcone, the cafes pie maker, was so startled she forgot to put the plastic babies into her king cake. The inspector didnt look in the fridge, didnt even look in the bathroom, Ms. Arcone said. When the inspector left, Were like, Ahh!She added, We got an A.Ms. Arcone, 58, sank into her seat by the door. On the counter sat her ring-shaped cake sprinkled with purple, green and yellow sugar. When a regular came over and said, This is delicious; thank you, Ruth, she looked up from her newspaper and said, Youre welcome.For five years Ms. Arcone was a fixture at the Cupcake Cafe, a Hells Kitchen institution at the corner of West 40th Street and Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. She made 40 kinds of pie but produced only 10 to 15 a week. Im making pies by hand, she explained. One at a time.She spent most of her days there, whether or not she was baking. She would chat with customers at a big marble table. And read aloud bits from the newspaper. Then, at 7 p.m., Ms. Arcone would pack up her papers and head home to Geffner House, a single-room occupancy residence a few blocks away in Midtown.At 11 p.m., she would start her second job, as night caretaker at the Dwelling Place, a nearby womens shelter.Almost 20 years ago, Ms. Arcone was a resident of that shelter.Homeless for two months, Ms. Arcone, who graduated from Stuyvesant High School and attended Cornell University, had been sleeping on the subway at night and hanging out at Barnes & Noble during the day.She was taken in by Sister Nancy Chiarello, one of the three nuns who run the privately funded shelter. She stayed for 14 months. The day she found housing at Geffner House, Sister Nancy offered her a job.Ms. Arcone is aware of the limits of her life: Financially, she gets by. But her room at Geffner House has no kitchen. She makes batches of food at the Dwelling Place and carries them home.Romantic love has been elusive. Ive never had a Valentines Day, she said, matter-of-factly.But she is comfortable in her artistry as a baker. And on that Mardi Gras afternoon, she was starting to feel some long-delayed confidence.Im thrilled, she said, looking down at her new sneakers with aquamarine stripes. Ive wanted these for a year.Six weeks later, on March 27, the cafe closed.Much has been written about the recent surge of homelessness in New York City, and the trauma of those living on the street. Anyone walking around Midtown Manhattan can see the toll: The bundled-up woman in the West 30s, her campsite covered with plastic, has made it through the winter. So has the woman, in a pleated skirt, who does her laundry in the bathroom sinks in Penn Station.This story, however, is about a woman who managed to get back on her feet, and yet still struggles with the reverberations from being homeless.For Ms. Arcone, it has been a long journey back.She is still picking up the pieces. Her confidence took a hit. Im good at working, she said. But not at presenting myself, at finding work. She is just starting to attend to her health. Last year, she signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and saw a doctor for the first time in 14 years.The number of homeless people and the number of single women in the shelter system have almost tripled since Ms. Arcone was homeless, according to data from the New York City Department of Homeless Services, the Human Resources Administration and NYCStat shelter census reports. When Ms. Arcone moved into the Dwelling Place in January 1997, there were 1,345 single women out of a shelter population of 23,698; in February of this year, there were 3,758 out of 60,410, the data show.When women first come in, theyre frightened, maybe ashamed of their situation, said Sister Joann Sambs, who helps run the shelter, which has provided support for homeless women since 1977.For many of them, homelessness is a new experience, she added. Theyve had their own lives  jobs, bank accounts, credit cards. Theyve lost it all.Getting back into the mix of daily life is an arduous process.Hells Kitchen has helped Ms. Arcone, she said. She relishes her lively neighborhood, particularly the two blocks  West 39th and 40th Streets  tucked into the shadow of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Those streets contain the Dwelling Place, to which she is devoted. The vegetable markets where she shops. And the Cupcake Cafe.The cafe, Ms. Arcone said, gave her a sense of community. The work she did was appreciated, said Ann Warren, 60, the cafes co-owner. Thats rare. So many people work terribly hard, and nobody sees them do it.As a child, Ms. Arcone would stand behind her mother, a skilled baker, in the kitchen. I was waiting to lick the spoon, she said.It was just the two of them. Her mother, a school secretary, raised her on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Her father, with whom she had little contact, died when she was 13.One Sunday morning, Ms. Arcone, then a senior at Stuyvesant, went into her mothers room before leaving to do volunteer work. Her mother had died in the night after a heart attack.I called the police, Ms. Arcone said. I was terrified. She was 17.My mother had named good family friends as my guardians, she continued. I moved in with them. But it just was not a good fit.She went to Cornell but couldnt find her footing. She did, however, discover that she loved to bake. I wanted to make the things my mother had made  her brownies and oatmeal cookies, she said.Leaving college after three years, she enrolled at the New York Restaurant School in Manhattan and later found work catering. But over the years, she had a couple of setbacks. In 1991, she fell and broke her wrist. She was without health insurance, and the hospital and surgery bills wiped out what savings I had, she said.Five years later, while cooking at the Cub Room in SoHo, her feet gave out. One day I finished work, Ms. Arcone said, went out to have breakfast, and when I got up, I couldnt walk.She didnt have money to see a doctor. (Months later, she was given a diagnosis of metatarsalgia, an inflammation in the ball of the foot.) Unable to work, she couldnt pay the rent. And she felt ashamed to ask for help. Your vision narrows, she said. I kept thinking, If I can just make it through the day.Fearing she would be evicted from her Brooklyn sublet, she gave away her beloved orange cat.Then, one night that November, she came back from the store. Theyd drilled out the lock, she said, referring to the landlord.Through the fall, she slept on the A train. She showered at the Russian & Turkish Baths in the East Village. By the end of December Ms. Arcone was  completely desperate, she said, and called a high school friend who was a lawyer. He said, Im not even going to send you to the city shelters, Ms. Arcone recounted. You wouldnt survive.He sent me to Sister Nancy, she explained. There was this relief: I was inside. I was warm. And I had a place to sleep.She became a customer at the Cupcake Cafe in 2008, and in 2011, Ms. Warren, an owner, asked if she would like to do some baking for the shop.The cafe first opened in 1988, on the corner of 39th Street and Ninth Avenue, and reflected the freewheeling character of Hells Kitchen in those days.Were not business people, said Michael Warren, 66, who owned the cafe with Ms. Warren, a painter. The couple divorced in 2010, but both remained with the cafe.The cafe featured doughnuts, as well as cakes and cupcakes decorated with Monet-like flowers by Ms. Warren and her staff, and became a neighborhood hub. Mikes rule was: If anybodys hungry, they can get a doughnut and a coffee, said Adelaide Morro, 61, a longtime employee, referring to Mr. Warrens generosity.A glowing review in The New York Times brought in those farther afield. The musician David Byrne and the actress Sarah Jessica Parker were among its customers. But after the 1990s, there were financial struggles. Opening in 2004, the cafe on West 40th Street had a smaller following. Two years later, the original location closed. In 2005, the couple opened a cafe in Books of Wonder, a childrens bookstore on West 18th Street; that cafe closed six years later.Yet the cafe on West 40th remained a haven for its regulars. The room was strung with paper lanterns. A few regulars stored their groceries there in an antique icebox.Ms. Arcone is alert to every change on Ninth Avenue: The Turkish restaurant on 39th Street got shut down by the health department, she said, heading out from the Cupcake Cafe on a frigid night in February. She needed ingredients for tomato soup. The owners just walked away. Then the pipes froze and burst.If it was us, she added, we would have cleaned till everything was right.Whats with the pajamas? she said, as she passed a young man wearing pajamas with a Nordic design.At Terra, a market on Ninth Avenue, she navigated the narrow aisles. There were bundles of bruised oranges and carrots for a dollar. And also fresh asparagus for $1.99.She paused by the Persian cucumbers: Have you had these? I love them! Then she grabbed two bunches of dill, scallions and a pint of cream for her soup. She would cook it at 3 a.m. at the Dwelling Place.At midnight, Ms. Arcone, who is not quite five feet tall, settled into her spot: a table in the residences dining room. Behind her was a painting of a young woman lighting Sabbath candles. Ms. Arcone, who is Jewish, likes the painting. Its been here as long as I have, she said.I like being here alone, she added. I know what I have to do at night. It doesnt matter in what order, or when I do it.Upstairs, 15 women were asleep. Lights must be turned off at 10:30 p.m. I can think of eight I know that Ive talked to, she said.Like some of the women who have stayed there, Ms. Arcone has struggled with depression. It hit after her mother died. We didnt know the word then, she said. Now doctors would have prescribed an antidepressant.Her 30s and 40s were tough.So much of it I spent feeling I was not any good, she said. At having a successful career, at getting married.But oh, my God, she continued, smiling. Somewhere between 50 and 60, things change. Ive accepted Im never going to be president, or White House pastry chef, or whatever.But Im doing what I like, she added. Im taking care of myself. And Ive got things under control.Two weeks before Easter, Ms. Arcone and Ms. Warren met at Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar in Chelsea Market for the dollar-an-oyster special. It was a late birthday celebration for Ms. Arcone.It was a rare break. The two friends were giddy.I have a fantasy, Ms. Warren said, looking out at the popular food marketplace, of having the Cupcake Cafe here. Part of the fantasy is that she could drift into Cull & Pistol.Theres no money to do it, she added. But I can dream.A waiter steered a platter of oysters toward them. Ms. Arcone closed her eyes as she ate her first.Her thoughts turned to her 60th birthday, two years away. I really want to see the Northern Lights, she said. The cheap way is to go to Iceland. The expensive way would be the Norway Coastal Voyage.Maybe we could apply for a kitchen job on a cruise ship, Ms. Warren said. Wed see nothing!A week later, Ms. Arcone opened the door to her room at Geffner House for a reporter.The walls were bare. But evidence of her passion was everywhere: There were hundreds of cookbooks in bookcases, stacked neatly on the radiator and filling bags.A window looked north toward the Hearst Tower. On the left you can see a bit of water, Ms. Arcone said. Sometimes you can see ships pull out and you can hear the horns.Taped to the door was The Daily Newss front page with the headline Im With Stupid! featuring the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump with Sarah Palin; a fan letter left by a customer; and a picture of a black cat.Ms. Arcone loves cats: Her one complaint about Geffner House is that no pets are allowed. Everybody knows having a cat is a healthy thing, she said. Its good for blood pressure, for loneliness.She is matter-of-fact about other aspects of the residence. Its noisy, she said, noting that there was jackhammering during the day from a renovation. Theres loan-sharking going on, drug dealing, she added. Youre riding the elevator with people so stoned they dont know what floor theyre going to.Yet she said, I dont feel unsafe.So why does she stay? Ms. Arcone pays only $698 rent. She might be able to find a room in an apartment somewhere, but she said, I dont want to share. Besides, she added: My longest commute to my two jobs is three blocks. You cant beat that.Ms. Warren told her staff five days before Easter that she had filed for bankruptcy and had to close the cafe.Talking about it later, she sounded relieved. Its the neighborhood living room, she said about her business, but the neighborhood living room is not a business.She said she felt terrible for her staff, and especially for Ms. Arcone. Ruth has been such a peach, she said. Ms. Warren had been talking with her and other staff members about possible projects, maybe a pop-up. Maybe she would even reopen. But for now, everything was in limbo.The cafes last day was Easter Sunday. Babys breath filled a vase on the big table. Wheat doughnuts were set out. Regulars milled around the piano as Murray Weinstock, 67, played jazz.Were having a wake, Ms. Arcone said, sitting in her chair. She looked exhausted. Its huge, she said of the closing. Its not only losing the work, the money. But if you live in a room, you want to get out, find someplace where you can just sit.She stood suddenly. My cake plate! she said, and disappeared into the kitchen. Ms. Arcone came back, holding it. This is mine, she said, and stashed it in her tote.The young staff members stood at the back, stunned.I guess Im in denial, said Rebecca Chambers, 31, a cake decorator who had been hired there when she was 19. Cupcake takes these tumultuous turns. It always lands on its feet.At 4 p.m. Ms. Arcone said, Ill be right back! She had made an Easter cake for the women at the Dwelling Place and needed to take it over. They eat at 6 p.m. sharp. It has a passion fruit curd filling, she said. Rebecca iced it with coconut cream cheese.Hurrying, she carried the unwrapped cake down West 40th Street toward 10th Avenue. Then, emerging from the shelter, she walked back to the cafe in the fading spring light."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The anonymous source behind the huge leak of documents known as the Panama Papers has offered to aid law enforcement officials in prosecutions related to offshore money laundering and tax evasion, but only if assured of protection from punishment.Legitimate whistle-blowers who expose unquestionable wrongdoing, whether insiders or outsiders, deserve immunity from government retribution, the source, who has still not revealed a name or nationality, said in a statement issued Thursday night.The documents, which list the true owners of thousands of companies created to hide the people behind them, expose the holdings of current and former world leaders and other prominent figures. The source, who uses the pseudonym John Doe but whose gender is not known, said that the papers could spur thousands of prosecutions, if only law enforcement could access and evaluate the actual documents.John Doe noted that journalists who have viewed the papers have said they will not turn over the full archive of 11.5 million documents. I, however, would be willing to cooperate with law enforcement to the extent that I am able, the source wrote.The statement, which was issued Thursday night under the condition that it not be reported until Friday morning, gave some hints about John Does political views and concerns. They include income inequality, the American campaign finance system and the revolving door of United States officials who take jobs at banks or other companies they once regulated.Banks, financial regulators and tax authorities have failed, the statement said. Decisions have been made that have spared the wealthy while focusing instead on reining in middle- and low-income citizens.Most of the revelations so far have involved wealthy foreigners and political players overseas. The statement came on the same day that the Obama administration, citing the disclosures, announced a series of steps intended to prevent wealthy individuals, including political leaders, from using offshore shell companies to hide assets, embezzle or avoid taxes.The proposals would create a centralized federal registry of the actual owners behind any newly established corporation, and would mandate that financial institutions collect and maintain information on these owners as bank accounts are set up. The moves would make it easier to investigate financial fraud.Our financial system should not provide the rich, the powerful and the corrupt with the opportunity to shield their assets and avoid paying their fair share or with the opportunity to hide any illicit activity, said Wally Adeyemo, the deputy national security adviser for international economics. Nobody should be able to play by a different set of rules.The statement by the Panama Papers source was released through the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung, which originally received the once-confidential archive of documents taken from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the newspaper who received the original leak with his colleague Frederik Obermaier, wrote in a blog post that he had confirmed via encrypted chat that the statement had come from the same person  of unknown nationality  who provided the secret documents.Sddeutsche Zeitung, working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a Washington-based group comprising more than 100 news media organizations, published articles about the Panama Papers starting last month that have set off political furors and unsettled financial institutions around the world.According to the consortium, the documents reveal the hidden assets of 12 current and former world leaders, 128 other politicians and officials, and a range of sports figures and celebrities. The 214,000 shadow companies described in the documents are tied to people in more than 200 countries and territories. The papers include long chains of emails showing how the companies have been used.News reports based on the documents have linked $2 billion in assets to a childhood friend of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and disclosed the holdings of the Aliyev family, which has long held power in Azerbaijan. The prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, said he would temporarily step aside after the revelation that he and his wife owned an offshore company.In the statement, the source denied being a government official or contractor, now or in the past. The confidential source was also extremely critical of the news media, suggesting that certain unnamed news organizations had declined initial offers to take and report on the documents.The measures announced on Thursday by the Obama administration, which in most cases have been in the works for years, would attempt to combat illegal tax shelters with a collection of new tools.The centralized federal registry of the actual owners behind any newly established corporation  the most far-reaching of the proposals  could be established only if Congress passes legislation, which is unlikely in this election year. Legislation pending in Congress would require the reporting of similar ownership information when new companies are set up, but the information would be filed at the Treasury Department only if states did not collect it on their own.Separately, the administration announced on Thursday that it had completed a rule, after four years of effort, that would require banks and other financial institutions in the United States to collect and keep accurate records on these same beneficial owners after they open a new bank account.The rule mandates that banks know the identity of anyone who owns at least 25 percent of a legal entity or who controls it, information that again could be provided to law enforcement investigators looking into fraud allegations.Treasury officials also called on Congress, after several years of delay, to ratify eight separate tax treaties with nations such as Luxembourg and Switzerland. The agreements would increase the amount of information that tax enforcement authorities in the various countries could share as they tried to crack down on illegal efforts to hide money.And the Treasury Department proposed a regulation that would allow it to mandate that foreign-owned companies set up in the United States, like companies based here, register with the Internal Revenue Service. That would allow the federal government to determine whether the companies owed any taxes to the United States or whether they might have been set up to illegally shield the owners from having to pay taxes overseas.Stefanie Ostfeld, the acting head of the United States branch of a nonprofit group called Global Witness, which has pushed for financial transparency laws, welcomed the moves by the Obama administration but said they were not necessarily sufficient. Many owners would remain hidden, she said, given that under the rules only individuals who own more than 25 percent of a company would have to identify themselves to banks.This is an important step to getting dirty money out of the financial system, she said. But there appear to be weaknesses in the regulation that provide would-be money launderers with a blueprint for how to structure companies to avoid detection and continue to have access to American banks."}
{"text": "A paper-based rapid test for the Zika virus was introduced on Friday by a consortium of research groups.The core of the test kit is a piece of paper covered with yellow dots that turn purple in the presence of Zika virus RNA. Although the test is relatively fast and simple, it requires preliminary heating to amplify a samples RNA, which can be done in most laboratories.The test, which gives results in two to three hours, is much faster and cheaper than the P.C.R. tests used now, said James J. Collins, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is one of the test designers.It should cost less than $1 per test, said Keith Pardee, a University of Toronto biochemist and another test designer.Dr. Collins took a cells normal reproductive machinery  including proteins, nucleic acids and ribosomes  and freeze-dried it on paper. The work was described in the journal Cell.The color change can be read by the eye or by an extra-sensitive scanner that may eventually be able to measure viral loads in the blood sample.The test has worked on Zika-infected monkey blood, which was used because human samples were hard to obtain in time. Now, Dr. Collins said, were talking with groups in Colombia and Brazil about testing it in the field.The collaboration also included scientists from Harvards Wyss Institute, the Broad Institute, Cornell, Arizona State and Boston University."}
{"text": "The Metropolitan Opera is projecting that it will take in only two-thirds of its potential box-office income in the season that ends Saturday, the lowest percentage on record, raising questions about how the organization is grappling with the significant challenges of mounting opera in the 21st century.Twenty years ago, the Met was earning more than 90 percent of potential box-office revenue. Tickets were even scarcer when it moved to Lincoln Center: The general manager at the time, Rudolf Bing, wrote in a 1966 internal memo that the companys many subscribers made it impossible ever to buy a ticket.But now the Met is faced with the same challenge that is confronting many other opera companies, orchestras and dance troupes in America: the decline of the subscription model, as older, reliable audiences that would attend many times each year are replaced by new theatergoers who go to the opera less often. This season, the Met says it will earn only 66 percent of possible box-office revenue, which officials said would be the lowest percentage ever.The Mets finances have been precarious in recent years, but even with its weak box-office figures the company ran a surplus last year because of large donations and across-the-board cuts made after it won concessions from its unions.When Peter Gelb became general manager a decade ago he tried to expand the audience by offering more new productions, modernizing theatrical values, simulcasting operas to cinemas around the world (and to Times Square, live, on opening night). He also raised ticket prices, which now average $158.50, because box-office revenues cover an ever-smaller percentage of the price of putting on operas.In an interview Mr. Gelb said he believed the current box-office slump was partly caused by timing, as the Mets older audience has aged out faster than it could be replaced. But he said he was encouraged that the Met had managed to sell tickets to 74,000 new buyers this season.We have more individual ticket-buyers than ever before, but because they are relatively new to the Met, they are not yet converted to the kind of opera fanaticism that would result in enough multiple ticket purchases to make up for the loss of the older subscribers, he said in a telephone interview. Thats basically the math thats going on. The number of new ticket buyers, however, gives us reasons for hope, he said.The Met is hardly alone. Attendance at classical music, opera and ballet fell between 2002 and 2012, according to the National Endowment for the Arts, as organizations struggle to make their programs affordable and appealing to new audiences.Marc A. Scorca, president and chief executive of Opera America, a service organization, said, This is emphatically not specific to New York, and not specific to the Met, adding that attendance at main stage performances dropped in the last 10 years almost across our entire field.The Lyric Opera of Chicago reported earning 103 percent of box-office capacity for 91 performances two decades ago. (Receipts exceeded 100 percent because of tickets donated back for resale.) By 2014, Chicago reported a 79 percent attendance rate at its 67 main stage performances.But the Mets scale and its international prominence make its fortunes of particular interest. The nations largest performing arts organization, with an annual budget of roughly $300 million and a house that can hold 4,000, it offered 225 performances of 25 operas.When discounts are accounted for, the Met projects an attendance rate of 72 percent. That will be in the ballpark of New York City Ballet, which expects to fill 75 percent of its seats. The New York Philharmonic said it expected to sell about 80 percent of its seats but did not report the extent of its discounting programs.Even in a rough season the Met will have sold about 660,500 opera tickets, more than almost any of its peers globally. Met sales averaged 2,869 seats per performance, which would have overflowed the Royal Opera House in London (2,256 seats), or the Vienna State Opera, (2,284 seats). Last season, the nearly-sold-out Vienna company had sales of 462,901 opera tickets; 421,100 people attended operas in 2o14 at the Paris Opera.Mr. Gelb said that the Met planned surveys and focus groups and would open more dress rehearsals to students and work to expand educational offerings. He said that since the companys softest sales came in winter, he was weighing a midwinter break.Expanding dress rehearsals would allow 26,700 students to attend next season. Mr. Gelb said he would move the students down from the highest reaches of the opera house. So instead of just enjoying cutting school  or missing school, I should say, since theyre going with their schools  they can actually be enjoying opera up close, he said.He said the company would continue to invest in the work it puts on the stage. When people new to opera come in to the Met, he said, we have to impress them  because we want them to come back.The memo in which Mr. Bing lamented having too few seats came to light as the company prepared to celebrate its 50th anniversary at Lincoln Center. We live, Mr. Gelb said, in a different time."}
{"text": "Just five years ago, Recep Tayyip Erdogans Turkey was the darling of Western leaders and Turkish liberals, evidence that Islam and democracy need not be incompatible. As prime minister at the time, Mr. Erdogan and Ahmet Davutoglu, one of his most loyal lieutenants, sought European Union membership, oversaw an economic recovery and began peace talks with Kurdish militants. The news Thursday that Mr. Davutoglu, who became prime minister when Mr. Erdogan took the presidents job in 2014, was quitting made it clear how drastically things have changed.Mr. Davutoglu may not have been much of a brake on Mr. Erdogans turn toward authoritarianism or on his campaign to create a powerful executive presidency. But at least the prime minister maintained a degree of independence on issues like management of the economy, imprisonment of academics and journalists (which Mr. Davutoglu opposed) and anticorruption legislation (which Mr. Erdogan blocked).As the rift between the men widened, Mr. Davutoglus ouster became inevitable. And when it is formally confirmed at a meeting of the Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.) on May 22, Mr. Erdogan is certain to install a more pliant prime minister, confirming himself as Turkeys unrivaled political leader.Even that would not fulfill Mr. Erdogans ambitions. Though his party has a comfortable majority in Parliament, it lacks the votes to change the Constitution or call a referendum. The next prime ministers mission presumably will be to call elections and make sure the votes are there.That would be a disaster. It would be just as unfortunate if the West, which has treated Mr. Erdogans repressive actions with kid gloves, were to be seen as abetting his gluttony for power. There is no doubt that the West needs him  the United States as a strategic NATO ally, the European Union for the deal with Turkey that has stemmed the flow of Syrian refugees into Europe.Democratic leaders should make abundantly clear that their dealings with Mr. Erdogan are emphatically not an endorsement of his illiberal rule, and that a turn back to the democratic promise of the early A.K.P. is a far surer path to partnership with the West."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Alex Ovechkin glumly sat on the bench with his head pressed against his forearm Wednesday night after the Washington Capitals lost Game 4 of their Stanley Cup playoff series against the Pittsburgh Penguins.Entering this second-round series, the focus was on Ovechkin and the Penguins Sidney Crosby, two superstars who are meeting in the playoffs for the first time since 2009. Instead, the series has been defined by unlikely heroes. Ovechkin, who led the league in goals for the sixth time in his career, and Crosby, who finished third in the league in scoring in the regular season, have only four points combined.Even worse for Ovechkin, his team is facing a three-games-to-one deficit and has been pushed to the brink of elimination. Game 5 is here Saturday night.Weve dug ourselves a hole, Capitals Coach Barry Trotz said Wednesday after Washingtons third straight loss. Well see if we can dig ourselves out.The Capitals steamrollered opponents during the regular season, outscoring their foes by 59 goals and handily winning the Presidents Trophy, awarded to the team with the N.H.L.s best record. They had the leagues second-best penalty killing, the fifth-best power play and a goaltender, Braden Holtby, who tied the N.H.L. record for the most wins in a season.The Capitals had built up such a head of steam that it appeared they might finally overcome their painful history of early playoff exits. Washington has not advanced past the second round since 1998, and the franchise has never won the Stanley Cup. Ovechkin is a three-time Hart Trophy winner as the N.H.L.s most valuable player, but his lack of playoff success is a common knock against him.All four games in this series have been decided by one goal, with two going into overtime. But it is a far cry from the epic clash between Crosby and Ovechkin seven years ago, when they each registered a hat trick in Game 2 before finishing with a combined 27 points in the series. Pittsburgh won the series in seven games and went on to win the Stanley Cup.Many of the plays that tipped the balance have come from the 21-year-old rookie goaltender Matt Murray and other less heralded contributors.The Penguins captured Game 4 with goals from Trevor Daley, a player Pittsburgh picked up in a trade in December from the Chicago Blackhawks, and Matt Cullen, a 39-year-old veteran, before Patric Hornqvist won the game in overtime.The win was all the more impressive because Pittsburgh was missing perhaps its most crucial player: defenseman Kris Letang, who averages around 30 minutes of ice time a night during the playoffs. Letang was suspended for Game 4 for a high, late hit on Washingtons Marcus Johansson. Pittsburgh was without its No. 2 defenseman, Olli Maatta, who has not played since a late hit by the Capitals Brooks Orpik in Game 2, for which Orpik was suspended for three games. Eric Fehr, a member of Pittsburghs second line who scored the winning goal in Game 2, was also absent from the game.It seems like every night different people step up at different times and make important, key plays that help us win, Pittsburgh Coach Mike Sullivan said on a conference call Thursday. To see these guys play as hard as they do for one another as their coaches, its a thrill.Sullivan has played a pivotal role, too. After he took over for Mike Johnston, who was fired in December after a disappointing start to the year, the Penguins went 33-16-5 to finish the regular season with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. Including the playoffs, they have won 40 of their last 59 games.Pittsburgh did much of this without Evgeni Malkin, who missed the last month of the regular season with an upper-body injury before returning for the Penguins first-round series against the Rangers.In the playoffs, Pittsburgh has survived without Marc-Andre Fleury, who has been their main goaltender for more than a decade after the Penguins picked him first over all in the 2003 draft. Fleury, in the first year of a four-year, $23 million contract, sustained a concussion at the end of March and was cleared to play before Game 3 against Washington. But he has stayed on the bench, backing up Murray, a move Sullivan referred to as common sense.In the two games since Fleury was cleared, Murray has stopped 81 of 85 shots.Murray, previously a standout in the minor leagues under Sullivan, is 6-1 with a 1.81 goals-against average and .944 save percentage in the postseason.I take time to reflect on whats happened and to look back at all the fun that Ive had and all the experiences that Ive had this season, Murray said Friday. Im feeling more and more comfortable.Murray has been aided by the play of Nick Bonino, a third-line center who has eight assists in nine postseason games.The rookie Conor Sheary, who started the season in the minor leagues, has been a productive mainstay on Pittsburghs first line. Carl Hagelin, acquired in a January trade, has two goals and four points in the second round.Those contributions have helped turn the Capitals into underdogs. Washingtons three-games-to-one hole in the series is something fewer than 10 percent of N.H.L. teams recover from. But the Capitals know it can be done. They led the Rangers by that count in last years second round before losing three games in a row.We have to take that experience and turn it around our way, Ovechkin said."}
{"text": "Months away from their expected nominations, theres already ample reason to expect Clinton vs. Trump to be the ugliest, most cringeworthy presidential contest of the modern era. It promises to be a half-year slog through the marital troubles, personal peccadilloes, financial ambitions, social-media habits and physical appearances of Dangerous Donald and Crooked Hillary, two labels that the campaigns and their allies are already deploying.That doesnt mean Hillary Clinton shouldnt try to elevate the debate. Deep beneath the accumulating rancor is a fascinating and potentially illuminating contest between a longtime Democrat and a come-lately Republican who both claim to speak for working-class people who feel betrayed by the political system. Both candidates are appealing to some of the nations most beleaguered citizens  lower-income whites for Donald Trump, and racial minorities for Mrs. Clinton. And both candidates won big victories among the 19 states where unemployment exceeds the national average, many of them in the South.Though Mr. Trumps ideas have so far been both muddled and changeable, his proposals may challenge Mrs. Clinton to present her domestic and foreign policy positions with greater power and clarity to draw a sharp contrast with a Trump campaign that is more headline than story.During the primaries, Mr. Trump has compensated for his lack of depth with personal attacks and one-liners, a tactic Mrs. Clinton should avoid emulating.As the campaign cycle enters a more serious phase, says Julian Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, Trump is going to need more than name-calling and scandal politics to overcome his lack of experience and worries that hes not suited to the job.Mr. Trumps appeal to working-class Americans rests on promises to wall off America from competition from foreign workers and goods. His line, Its not free trade, its stupid trade, is hardly an invitation to a thoughtful debate. Yet it will be Mrs. Clintons challenge to counter by explaining her own evolving position on trade pacts, which has led her to oppose agreements she once supported. Going further, she can offer ways to assist workers who have been hurt by trade, as well as by general manufacturing job losses that have little to do with trade.Mr. Trumps opposition to trade deals is one element of a broader isolationism that can be discerned through the haze of his recent America First foreign policy address. In that speech, he threatened to walk away from various aspects of international engagement, from trade with China to NATO.We have not had a fundamental debate in a presidential campaign between American engagement in the world and isolationism since 1952, between Taft and Eisenhower, says Max Boot, a conservative foreign policy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. Its easy to ridicule Trumps cockamamie, half-baked proposals, and they ought to be ridiculed. But maybe it does force Clinton to articulate very clearly why we need to stay engaged in the world.Mrs. Clintons camp is preparing her for the worst: the prospect of debating a candidate with no policy details and a full arsenal of insults. Her best strategy is to simply stay on the substance and dont let him rankle her, says Elaine Kamarck, a Clinton White House policy official now at the Brookings Institution. Shell help herself if he continues to spout off, and she simply talks to America about the issues of the day."}
{"text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.  There are no holes in Nyquists rsum. He is the reigning 2-year-old champion and is undefeated in seven starts. He has soundly beaten three of the top contenders in previous races  Exaggerator, Brodys Cause and Mohaymen. His trainer and jockey already have Kentucky Derby victories under their belts.So why do horse aficionados believe Nyquist is immensely beatable Saturday, in the 142nd running of the Derby? The racetrack is a place where irrational logic rules. And there are several reasons that this colt is deemed vulnerable despite accomplishments better than last years Triple Crown champion, American Pharoah, and rivaling those of the 1977 Triple Crown champ, Seattle Slew.Atop them is a recent statistical anomaly: Can the morning-line favorite really win the Kentucky Derby for a fourth year in a row?Probably not.In the past 17 years, the average payoff for a $2 win bet in the Derby was more than $29.70, a number diminished in recent years by the three previous victors. American Pharoah paid $7.80, California Chrome $7 and Orb $12.80.In fact, there would be some symmetry if a horse with double-digit odds thwarted Nyquist. The colts trainer, Doug ONeill, and rider, Mario Gutierrez, teamed up for the last Derby bomber in 2012 with Ill Have Another (15-1). That colt was good enough to win the Preakness Stakes before scratching on the eve of the Belmont with a sudden tendon injury.On paper, Nyquist seems to be a far superior horse. He has already beaten some highly regarded contenders in this Derby field. He turned back Mohaymen in the Florida Derby, Brodys Cause last year in the Breeders Cup Juvenile and Exaggerator twice  in the San Vicente Stakes as well as the Juvenile.He is the son of Uncle Mo, who was a 2-year-old champion that relished shorter distance but finished 10th in his only attempt at a mile and a quarter  the Derby distance  in the 2011 Breeders Cup Classic. Nyquist is among his first crop of runners to hit the track. In addition, ONeill has given Nyquist just two prep races this spring, one of them a seven-furlong sprint.I know my colt can get the distance, said Kent Desormeaux, the Hall of Fame rider who is riding Exaggerator for his brother, the trainer Keith Desormeaux. Im not sure Nyquist can.Even since romping to a six-and-a-half-length victory last month in the Santa Anita Derby, Kent Desormeaux has been itching for another shot at Nyquist.I think its our race, he said.Keith Desormeaux is not as brash, but he made it clear he liked his colts chances.Hes happy, healthy and fit, he said. Hes settled in and is a happy horse. He isnt fidgety. I couldnt ask for more. I have no complaints.The brothers are hardly alone in thinking they have a capable horse. The Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert, fresh off a historic Triple Crown with American Pharoah, has been quietly confident in Mor Spirit, who has never been worse than second in seven starts. Gary Stevens, another Hall of Famer, will guide Mor Spirit out of the No. 17 hole, the only gate that has not produced a Kentucky Derby winner in the 141-year history of the race.The last time I had Post 17, it was with Gary Stevens and Point Given, and we all know how that turned out, Baffert said of the colt that was the beaten favorite in the 2001 Derby. He went on to win the Preakness and Belmont Stakes as well as Horse of the Year.The post didnt get him beat, he said. Now, we just need to go and make history again.Even the trainer of an outsider like Majesto  30-1 on the odds board  believes that Nyquist can be had. Gustavo Delgado is convinced that Majesto will make up the three-and-a-quarter lengths that separated the colt from Nyquist the last time they met, in the Florida Derby.I think theres going to be a lot of speed, Delgado said. Someone will soften Nyquist up and my horse will be in the middle. I want him to run the last five furlongs. Remember, in the Derby, you need luck. Anything can happen.ONeill, the trainer of Nyquist, has taken the skepticism of his colt in stride. In 2012, he had a difficult experience during the Triple Crown season when The New York Times reported that over 14 years and in four states, he had received more than a dozen violations for giving his horses improper drugs, and that his horses also had a tendency to break down or show signs of injury at more than twice the average rate nationally.In the weeks before Belmont, ONeill was given a 45-day suspension because one of his horses was found to have an elevated level of carbon dioxide after a race in 2010, which can indicate that the horse was given a milkshake, a mix of baking soda, sugar and electrolytes delivered through a tube down a horses nose to combat fatigue.At the time, ONeill denied that he had ever employed the technique. He did acknowledge that he had been careless operating his stable, running too many horses at too many racetracks, and that he had made mistakes. Beyond the public scrutiny, New York regulators instituted stricter drug monitoring and surveillance policies before the Belmont Stakes.The trainer has said that he has tightened up his operation, and that the experience, no matter how uncomfortable, benefits him now, when he is under the pressure of having the favorite in the years most important race.It has allowed me to not be overwhelmed this time, ONeill said. We found out that time that we had success doing what wed been doing all along. It worked. So were just doing that again  same patterns, same style. We just want to stay on course. Thats whats going to work."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Gloria Steinem and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were engrossed in conversation steps from his ceremonial office, where he was getting his makeup done. Ms. Steinem, already prepped, was here to interview him for Woman, her new Vice TV show.She skipped past notes her producers had readied about their topic, Its on Us, the White Houses pledge initiative against sexual assault, and led with her own question: What motivated him to take on this cause? She pressed him on gender-related problems in the military  the culture is changing, he said, in part because of advocates like her. A photo of Joe and Glo was snapped for her new Instagram account.After the vice president strode away, young White House staffers stepped in to angle for their own selfies. Seen-it-all aides went rapt as Ms. Steinem recounted her experience as a 17-year-old in Washington (We made it a project to swim in all the fountains), the first president she remembers (Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the times she picketed outside the Capitol (numerous).While Ms. Steinem, 82, has clocked a half-century as an activist, journalist and feminist leader, Woman is the first time she has produced and hosted a TV series. Beginning on Tuesday, it will run on the new cable channel Viceland, exploring in eight weekly episodes human rights and violence against women around the world, from child marriage in Zambia to sexual attacks in the United States military. It is not an easy watch, but Ms. Steinem was adamant that it would present a complex portrait of its subjects, as survivors and advocates, and offer viewers a way to become involved.What I hope is, seeing it will be the closest thing to being on the ground yourself, she said. It is being a witness. And people in hard times need a witness, and somebody who can help.In her focus on first-person accounts and D.I.Y. support systems, Ms. Steinem is aligned with the interests of millennial audiences  the kind that Vice, in their unlikely partnership, hopes to deliver. What that demographic, newly awoken to her legacy, might not realize is how well Ms. Steinem  a social networker even before she joined Twitter; a nondriver; a voracious traveler who has spent most of her career without a formal job; and a lifelong rule-breaker who can rock a raised fist and a raunchy punch line  fits in with them already.I think shes a hero, said Shane Smith, a founder of Vice who greenlit the show.The two met at a Google conference in 2014, where she talked about the global upsurge in violence against women and the fact that it was now extreme enough so that there are fewer females on earth than males, she recalled.Mr. Smith was listening. She gave a speech and then I bawled my eyes out, he said. I was blown away by her storytelling and the wealth of her experience. Given her connections and insight, he added, I realized she was a natural producer.But their collaboration was hardly an obvious match: Vice made its name on bro-centric content, heavy on the danger-zone posturing, gross-out humor and dopey stoner antics. (Even its nerdiest cable show is called Balls Deep.) And as the brands poster boy, Mr. Smith, a major onscreen presence in Vices separate HBO show, has reveled in a cussing, anti-authoritarian persona even as he became a vaunted, and wealthy, chief executive.Ms. Steinem knew of Vices very masculine reputation, as she put it. So before she committed to the series, which began development in October 2014, she sniffed around for any trouble and emerged at ease. It felt to me like an organization that had started one way and was becoming much more universal, she said in an interview in Vices clubby offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. What it reminded me of was New York magazine, where she landed early in her career in the 1960s. That was totally male  Jimmy Breslin and Tom Wolfe, and all these writers. And that also was open to change. (A subsidy from New Yorks editor Clay Felker enabled Ms. Steinem and others to start Ms. Magazine in 1971.)It helped that the team for Woman was almost entirely female, led by a group of female producers, among them Ariel Wengroff, a 26-year-old with a background in politics. Before she landed at Vice two years ago, Ms. Wengroff had never worked on, let alone created, a TV show.It was a complete leap of faith, she said of working on Woman, which she and Mr. Smith developed with the Vice News producer Iris Xu, Ms. Steinem and her longtime associate Amy Richards. From the crew up, it is the most heavily female-staffed program in Vicelands lineup. (The company also began Broadly, an online channel oriented toward women, in 2015.)Ms. Steinem has other TV credits and talk show offers were dangled over the years, but they required too much time, she said, and she wasnt keen on network oversight. Vice feels much more able to move quickly, she said.Back in New York, she invited some compatriots to the Soho House for a first feedback screening: leaders from the Ford Foundation and Equality Now, along with Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian Nobel Peace Prize winner. They watched the series wrenching premiere about rape as a tool of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Episodes begin and end with Ms. Steinem speaking to the camera about the challenges facing women, but the bulk of the reporting is handled by young international correspondents, chosen by Vice, who straddle the line between journalist and activist, as Ms. Steinem does. They shot in eight countries; an episode in Pakistan, directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, this years Oscar winner for documentary short, is still in progress.Ms. Steinem did not travel with them, but her expertise paved the way. Gloria brought a whole different level of credibility and access to women on the ground that we wouldnt have had otherwise, Ms. Wengroff said, suggesting where we could and couldnt go, who she felt was credible and who shes worked with, and who also is new that we could empower.The host of the debut episode, Isobel Yeung, journeys along bumpy roads to meet a warlord, and is barred from an interview despite having arranged for access  a marker of authenticity in this documentary style. She is also visibly distraught by the horrors her subjects reveal. In typical Vice fashion, the camera cuts back often to capture correspondents reactions, their tears and outrage. Ms. Steinem loved this intimate take: an emotional entry point.After the screening, the audience swapped resources. Ms. Steinem wanted more footage online of women sharing their survival stories. We have to figure out how strong they are, and how to leave hope, she said. The challenge is to know, and not despair, and figure out how to make it better a little bit at a time.For Ms. Steinem, hatching ideas about grass-roots networking  how to introduce one rebel group to another, say  is as elemental as breathing. Theres nothing better than empathy, she said a few days later, at Vices offices. It was her first visit to its new headquarters, a sprawling refurbished warehouse, with a coffee bar on the ground floor and solar power on the terrace, and she turned a few heads. But wearing a snug leather jacket, skinny black pants and a keffiyeh-style scarf, she hardly looked out of place  though she was, almost certainly, the oldest person there.The generational divide between Ms. Steinem and many in her circle is inescapable and also somewhat irrelevant. Shes a cultural magpie  shell quote the organizing principles of Black Lives Matter, mention doing a version of the disco move the Bump in Zambia, and reference the French statesman Georges Clemenceau (Military justice is to justice what military music is to music). I think Im like an overstimulated 6-year-old, she said, because theres so many things, and theyre so interesting!In an email, her friend Lena Dunham wrote: Something amazing about Gloria is that she is totally not content to rest on her laurels or stick to mediums shes comfortable with. Its the reason she remains so deeply relevant  that refusal to settle in.Ms. Steinem was at Vice to watch footage of her interview with Mr. Biden and to give notes on an episode about female fighters in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a rebel group.She was warned that the chairs in the screening room reclined. But do they vibrate? she said.Then she got down to business. She turned away when her face appeared on screen  even after a lifetime, she doesnt like watching herself. She still gets anxious about public speaking, too. I had chosen to be two things in my life, a dancer and a writer, she said, because I didnt want to talk. But Im grateful. The fact that no editor would print what I wanted to write, forced me into talking.She can still rile, as she learned after some comments she made about Bernie Sanderss and Hillary Clintons popularity with young women were, she said, misconstrued. If I had meant what they thought I meant, Id be mad at me too, she said, of the idea that some young women support Mr. Sanders only because men do. She was talking about the allocation of power, not boyfriends, she said, and gladly took to social media to explain herself. Its very important to experience at least one Twitter war, she said, explaining later: It was very educational. Lots of bad things have happened to me, but not with such brevity.For the Vice team, Ms. Steinems presence has been a series of pinch-me moments. Im lucky to be working with her, Mr. Smith, the Vice executive, said. Though hes reported from North Korea and covered jihadis, some of the hardships that Woman details were new to him. I found lots of it difficult to watch, he said, and grew pensive. This is going to get very hippie-dippie, he said. I believe the universe gave me daughters  his are 4 and 5  to help me understand the world better.Ms. Steinem was impressed by her all-female Vice crew, too, whom she saw as emblematic of a generation striving not against what is, but toward what can be. They are smart, caring and fast, she wrote in an email. She even proudly sported some company bling  a gold ring that spells out Vice, given to its top brass  although she did ask, Is this gender-free jewelry?Assured that it was worn by all sexes, she kept it on."}

{"text": "HOUSTON  Gov. Greg Abbotts campaign sent me an email one morning, showing the governor aiming a pump-action shotgun in my direction. This was a view of an elected official I had never seen  the get-your-hands-up view. If I contributed $25 to his campaign, I would be entered in a contest to win a shotgun. The subject line of the email read: Shotgun! It was a typical morning in Texas.The prize was special, though. It was not a rare antique. It was, the email noted three times, a Texas-made shotgun.Those are some of the most potent words in the states vocabulary: Texas-made. In a cupboard in our home here, we had a bottle of 1835, a bourbon bottled in Texas and named for the year of the first battle for Texas independence. My crunchy peanut butter is made with Texas-grown peanuts. My salsa of choice is Native Texan (Born in Texas, Never Leavin Texas). I am not sure where our minivan was made, but as I idle at red lights I know the heritage of the Toyota Tundra in front of me. The stickers on the pickup trucks, built in San Antonio, declare: Born in Texas, Built by Texans.I was born and raised in Central California, and I moved to Houston from Brooklyn in June 2011 to cover Texas for The New York Times. I live here with my wife, my 7-year-old son and my 3-year-old daughter, who keeps a pair of pink cowboy boots outside on the porch or inside by the front door. I have covered stories in the South, the Midwest and other parts of the country. People in those places identified with their political party, their job, their cause, their sexual orientation, their city, their race. Almost no one identified with their state the way Texans do.Who are these people, these Texans? What do they tell us about America? What to make of a state that is so focused on itself? I wrestle with these questions all the time.One day, behind a general store in Central Texas, a firearms instructor in a wide-brimmed cowboy hat reached for the butt of his holstered gun as I approached him for an interview. The general store, the hat, the reach for the gun: the line between the myth of Texas and the reality of Texas is razor thin.I have met Texas Rangers who actually do seem larger than life and artists and writers who have taken the states entrepreneurial energies in entirely cool directions. Ive met conspiracy theorists, Texas secessionists and Texas nationalists (there is a difference), as well as those in the parallel and wholly separate Texas made up of the uninsured, the undocumented, the imprisoned and the poor. Much of it is not my world, but despite that  or perhaps because of it  I think Im becoming a little bit Texan. The historian T. R. Fehrenbach once wrote that Texas shaped those who lived upon it more than they changed it.You dont just move to Texas. It moves into you.My life as a Texan is exactly what you might imagine it would be. The other day, I crawled around the bathroom floor trying to catch a palm-size green anole lizard that had sneaked into the house. I spent a recent weekend at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, eating Frito pie and watching the piglet races with my children. My son stands every morning in his classroom and recites the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag. And then he makes another pledge to the Texas flag, in accordance with Section 25.082 of the Texas Education Code, which requires all children in public schools to recite the two pledges. It is not some vestige of the late 1800s: The law was passed by the Texas Legislature in 2003.About a month after I moved here, a 41-year-old man named Mark Stroman told Texas that he loved Texas, just before Texas killed him. As he lay on the gurney in the states execution chamber, Mr. Stroman, a convicted murderer who had an eighth-grade education and was a native Texan, uttered as part of his last statement, Texas loud, Texas proud. It was a jaw-dropping moment that set a theme for me. After nearly five years in Texas, the theme has only intensified: the metamorphosis of Texas, the countrys second-most populous state, into ultra-Texas, of a singular state into a singular superstate.I think part of the reason Texas is having a moment is because its being more itself than its ever been, said Stephen Harrigan, a novelist and essayist in Austin who is writing a history of the state. Its Texas unchained, in a way.Texas, of course, comes by its sense of being a place apart honestly: From 1836-1845, it was its own country, the Republic of Texas, and it has long feasted on hyperbole. But these days Texas does feel increasingly like a caricature of a caricature.Texas has long had an anti-Washington streak, but, lest anyone doubt it, the state has sued the federal government more than 40 times in the past 13 years. In December, an executive committee of the Republican Party of Texas approved a resolution supporting secession and calling for the issue to be put to voters statewide. (Party leaders struck down the resolution after a heated debate.)This new ultra-Texas started in 2009, shortly after President Obama took office  replacing a Texan, George W. Bush. Since then the lines between being pro-Texas, anti-Obama and anti-American blurred, and there has been no going back. So while other red-state governors gripe about federal overreach, Mr. Abbott is the only one to propose, in a 92-page document called the Texas Plan, a convention of states to amend the Constitution to allow states to override Supreme Court decisions and federal regulations.Before he was elected in 2014, Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, traveled the state using an unofficial campaign slogan supplied to him by his campaign treasurer, the rocker and conservative provocateur Ted Nugent: Keep Texas the last best place.The notion of Texas as the best place, the exceptional place, is an old one. In his 1961 book about Texas, John Bainbridge described the state as a mirror in which Americans see themselves reflected, not life-size but, as in a distorting mirror, bigger than life. He called the book The Super-Americans.But the idea that Texas is the last place is part of a new phenomenon. People throughout the state say they believe that their way of life is under assault and that they are making a kind of last stand by simply being Texan. It is this fear, anger and sometimes paranoia that lurks beneath the surface of Texas politics and that underlies the expansion of gun rights, the reflexive antagonism toward Washington, and the opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and other issues that seems essential for succeeding in state politics these days. Senator Ted Cruzs remarks dismissing New York values at a Republican debate should come as no surprise. Thats how people from the last best place talk about other places.But Texas is not under attack. It is merely changing as America changes with it. It is a majority-minority state that has become increasingly diverse and nonwhite  rural Texas is shrinking while urban and suburban Texas is expanding  and the tension between what Texas is and what it was has come to define the state.The hard-right domination of Texas politics frustrates the states Democrats and plenty of others in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. They are agitated, but they stay put because they view Texas as forever, and Republican Texas as a kind of temporary occupation. Its hard to know if theyre right, but easy to see why peoples emotional investment in Texas transcends conservative politics.Consider Jack S. Blanton Sr., an oil tycoon and philanthropist from Houston who died in 2013 at age 86. His brothers were born in Texas but, to his chagrin, he was born in Shreveport, La. One day 40 years ago, his daughter, who was living in Boston, went into labor with his first grandchild. By the time he arrived from Houston at the hospital, visiting hours were over.So Mr. Blanton climbed up the hospitals fire escape to see his newborn granddaughter. And he had something with him: a baggie of Texas dirt, which he put under the babys bassinet, so she could begin her life over Texas soil, or something close to it.Its sort of like getting baptized, said Mr. Blantons daughter, Elizabeth Blanton Wareing.As the world grows smaller, as technology obliterates the significance of where we live and work, as Americans become more transient, Texas resists. It declares, to itself and the nation: Place matters. America needs a superstate, or to put it another way, an antistate. Sometimes we love it here and sometimes we are disgusted here, but, to twist Gertrude Steins line about Oakland, Calif., there is a here here. We tattoo Texas on our arms, buy Texas-built trucks and climb fire escapes with Texas dirt in our pockets. Place, we are unsubtly suggesting, matters.At Mr. Abbotts inauguration last year in Austin, I sat facing a stage assembled on the steps of the Capitol. Before Mr. Abbotts speech, Texas marked the occasion with the sounds of warfare. It was the inaugural tradition of cannon fire.People flinched as the echo of artillery filled the streets. From a distance, it must have sounded like Austin was under attack. Up close, it felt like the opposite: Austin was doing the attacking. And there, for me, was Texas: The last best place with state-sanctioned cannon fire, making people proud while making people wince."}
{"text": "A GEORGIAN ESTATE ON THE COAST OF WALES$2.56 MILLION  (1.75 MILLION POUNDS)Perched on a rocky outcropping overlooking the Dovey Estuary, this 3.54-acre estate includes a four-bedroom five-bath house, a restored cottage and a small private island. The property is on the west coast of Wales, near the village of Aberdovey (Aberdyfi in Welsh) at the southern end of Snowdonia National Park. The Cambrian Coast Railway Line cuts through one side of the property, connecting the local towns to Pwllheli, a resort town in northern Wales.Known as Trefri Hall, the 5,088-square-foot main house was built in the 19th century; the cottage dates to the 17th century. The property is designated a Grade II listed site, which means no major changes can be made without the approval of the local conservancy.The historic listing is definitely seen as a benefit, said Belinda Hutchinson-Smith of Strutt & Parker, the listing agent for the property. It ensures the character of the property.The entrance of the main house leads to a reception hall, with broad views of Cardigan Bay. The house features deep sash windows, 14-foot ceilings, period molding and an oak staircase. There is a marble fireplace in the sitting room, which has a wide bay window overlooking the estuary, which attracts a variety of migratory birds. In 2003, the current owners added a glass conservatory with views of the estuary, the river and the surrounding hills. There is another marble fireplace in the dining room, which is attached to the conservatory. The kitchen features an AGA range and a small breakfast area.The four bedrooms are upstairs; each has its own en-suite bathroom. (The fifth bathroom is on the ground floor.) All the bathrooms have been refurbished over the last six years with underfloor heating, new showers and porcelain tiles, the owner said. One upstairs bathroom has a free-standing bath tub next to a window with views of the estuary.The two-story cottage was refurbished over the last four years. Originally a long farmhouse with living quarters on the top floor and stables below, it now has two large bedrooms and one bathroom, a living room with a balcony, and two wood-burning stoves. Around the cottage, there are old stables and barns, now used for storing garden equipment.The grounds have several cultivated garden areas surrounded by stone walls, featuring azaleas, hybrid rhododendrons, fruit trees and Japanese maple trees. There are two greenhouses and separate workshops. A boat house has been converted into an office, with a wood-burning stove and French doors leading to a deck and a dock. A castellated bridge leads to the island, which is deserted except for a contemporary decorative turret.The furniture and art on the property are not part of the asking price, but select pieces are available for sale, including furniture dating to the 17th century, the owner said. Nineteen acres of pasture adjacent to the property are also available for sale, although the land is currently rented to a sheep farmer, according to the owner.The nearest village, Aberdovey, is about a mile and a half away and has a post office, grocery stores, pubs and restaurants. Buses passing the house provide connections to Aberdovey and to local towns. The nearest international airports are Manchester and Birmingham, which are both about two and a half hours away by car or train. The train trip to London is about four and a half hours.MARKET OVERVIEWWales is a much different market from the rest of Britain, according to agents. Sales activity and pricing tend to be steadier than in the roller-coaster markets of London and other areas.We havent had the highs, so we probably wont see the lows, said Anthony Clay, a partner with Knight Frank, the real estate company.Housing prices in Wales were down 0.3 percent in 2015, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. A sluggish British economy and uncertainty about the future have dampened sales activity, agents said. But the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors expects prices to rise 6 percent and sales by 3 percent this year, primarily because of short supply.Over all, prices for large country homes in rural Wales are often a fraction of the price of properties closer to London. But they are also hard to find. There isnt a massive turnover, Ms. Hutchinson-Smith said. Many of the bigger estates in rural Wales are passed from generation to generation and rarely come on the market, she said.For something exceptional, the market is still very good, she said. The really special ones dont tend to be sold very often.In recent months, the higher-priced homes have been selling more than the lower range of the market, according to Julie Elliott, an associate in the Swansea office of Fine & Country, the real estate company. A lot of buyers are second-home buyers, she said.Many were buying before a new Stamp Duty increase on second homes went into effect in April, she says. Now it will probably slow down slightly, Ms. Elliott said.WHO BUYS IN WALESWales doesnt attract the wealthy foreign buyers found in many areas of Britain, agents said. Its too remote for many international buyers, who like to be in range of Heathrow, the London airport, Mr. Clay said.Around the cities, investors are active buying homes to lease. But they are less interested in the rural and coastal areas. Anything beyond Cardiff in southern Wales and Bristol in southwest England is just harder work to sell, Mr. Clay said.A majority of the buyers in the coastal and rural areas are looking for a second home or a place to retire, agents say. Waless beautiful scenery and wildlife also attract hikers, bird watchers, hunters, fishing enthusiasts and sailors.A lot of buyers are coming home to Wales, Ms. Elliott said. They left and now they are returning to either buy a second home or relocate to Wales, she said. People are buying second homes who probably will end up living in them.BUYING BASICSWales follows the same basic buying procedures as the rest of Britain, agents said. There are no restrictions on foreign purchases. Mortgages are generally available. Typically buyers search for property without an agent and then hire a lawyer to complete the transaction, agents said.WEBSITESOfficial Welsh tourism site: visitwales.comWelsh government site: wales.gov.ukStamp Duty information:  gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax/residential-property-ratesLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Welsh; British pound (1 pound = $1.46)TAXES AND FEESBritain charges a Stamp Duty ranging from 2 percent to 12 percent on properties of more than 125,000 pounds, or around $182,500, depending on the purchase price. In April, a new law went into effect charging an extra 3 percent for a home that is not a primary residence. Agent commissions are typically 1.5 percent of the purchase price, paid by the seller. Annual property taxes on this estate are about $8,000, according to the owner.CONTACTBelinda Hutchinson-Smith, Strutt & Parker, (011-44) 1743 284200; struttandparker.com"}

{"text": "PARIS VAGABONDBy Jean-Paul ClbertTranslated by Donald Nicholson-SmithPhotographs by Patrice Molinard314 pp. New York Review Books. Paper, $18.95.So many books about Paris are concerned with the rich, matronly capital city, but this one, originally published in French in 1952, is about the postwar Paris of the poor and their not always successful efforts to eat, drink and stay warm. Its a picture of a bohemian Paris that has now all but disappeared, though I say bohemian advisedly since Jean-Paul Clbert (who was born in 1926 and died in 2011) had a horror of the picturesque.A middle-class boy, Clbert ran away from a Jesuit boarding school at 17 and joined the French Resistance. After World War II, he decided to live rough, scribbling notes about the things he observed and stuffing them away for safekeeping. Then one day he sat down to write. This method produced a remarkably vivid, detailed book that seems to have been composed with no method, its narrative marked by a chaotic and cheerfully self-acknowledged spontaneity. Clbert also admits that if he first took to the streets in order to get laid, he remembers the cityscape better than the young women: gas works, apartment buildings fit for troglodytes, unlikely skyscrapers silhouetted against the void, lowlife hotels, bals musettes, empty lots, labyrinthine streets, city gates, suburban bus stops, overhead metro lines, traffic tunnels.Characteristically, Clberts favorite locale was the Zone, where the ring road surrounding Paris now stands. Once the site of fortifications protecting the city, it became a no mans land after they were torn down. In this place where building was officially forbidden, the desperate and defiant made their home: a community of ragmen, scrap-metal dealers, chair bottomers, panhandlers, raisers of poultry or of white mice, ensconced in a patchwork of uncultivated plots and shacks separated by hedges of folding bedsteads (remarkable by their number), dwellings constructed more of wood than of concrete, more of boards and sheet metal than of brick, structures whose purpose is not immediately apparent: cabin, toolshed, rabbit hutch, outhouse?In my 16 years of living in the city, I caught glimpses of this old Paris. My street, the Rue des Lombards, was the street of old prostitutes, for whom there was a vigorous market of young male clients. I made some sketchy friends: petty thieves, dishwashers, carnival workers, rent boys. They could scarcely understand my Alliance Franaise French; each was proud to be a titi parisien and to speak with the accent of Belleville and Mnilmontant. Some of them used verlan, in which the first and last syllables are reversed (bizarre, for example, becoming zarbi), or employed their own particular argot. I remember an old taxi driver telling me that in the 1930s hed been a sharp, competitive dresser and had worn golf trousers, even though he couldnt play golf. This was the world of Cline, occasionally of Jean Genet  and of Jean Vigos LAtalante, a film about life on a barge on the Seine.Clbert writes of a place where you bought three Gauloises out of a pack, where beggars whod been lucky stood their mates for a round and sang old ballads, then gathered a few butts by way of provision for the night. He visits the huts along the Seine where the corpses of suicides are fished out of the river. And he spends time in pitiful flea markets like the ones I saw in Montreuil in the 90s, where vendors sell unmatched pairs of boots, ragged jackets and trousers, garments at a hundred francs, surplus pieces of leather, printed papers much stained but still readable ... bundles of postcards, bits of scrap metal, bags of bent and rusty nails, broken or defective concierges knickknacks, and so on. Unmatched, stained, bent, rusty, broken, defective  just like these poor devils, their faces plaster masks of no-more-hope. Clbert is a master of the long, cascading list-sentence, trippingly rendered into English by Donald Nicholson-Smith. His descriptions are mirrored by (not illustrated by) the bleak photographs of Patrice Molinard.A connoisseur of chaos, Clbert is the poet of the lumpenproletariat and of a forgotten city: Between the two bridges, mainly on the Left Bank, ones sense of smell is overstimulated by a succession of odors, as follows (read slowly): cheese, very violent, then, by turns, gas welding, fresh periwinkles and new rust. He has a very precise sensorium.Luc Sante, who has written the informative introduction to this volume, has recently offered his own look at the city, The Other Paris, a brilliantly researched narrative that touches on everything from the Paris Commune to dime novels. Here he tells us that Clberts book was inspired by Henry Miller and Blaise Cendrars. I recently reread Millers Quiet Days in Clichy and Cendrarss The Astonished Man, which are both more involving than Paris Vagabond because they are built around developed characters. Cendrars, for example, gives us Micks woman, who likes to tease their dog like a magpie: Like that comic and carefree bird, she adored romping with Volga and playing pranks to bewilder her.In similar fashion, Miller gives us his destitute flatmate, the volatile Carl, who joins him in an endless search for women and drink. Clbert isnt self-concealing, exactly, but he seems determined not to be egotistical, even though memoirs feed off the ego. And he seems to have a fault frequently found in memoirists: the fear that readers will find his milieu more interesting than he is."}

{"text": "BEIJING  Three Nobel laureates in science and economics who visited North Korea this week for what was billed as an educational exchange said Saturday that they had met university students who were eager to learn, but who were hampered by the Norths tight Internet controls and by rudimentary, decades-old equipment.Two of the laureates, Aaron J. Ciechanover of Israel, a biologist, and Sir Richard Roberts, the chief scientific officer at New England Biolabs in Massachusetts, said at a news conference in Beijing that they had invited North Korean students to come and work in their laboratories. But that prospect appeared unlikely.The weeklong visit by Mr. Ciechanover, Mr. Roberts and a third laureate, Finn Erling Kydland, a Norwegian who shared the Nobel for economics in 2004, was organized by the Vienna-based International Peace Foundation and by the National Peace Committee of Korea, an organ of North Koreas ruling Workers Party. The trip, which ended Friday, was authorized by Kim Yong-nam, the president of North Koreas Supreme Peoples Assembly, and was intended as an exchange of educational views, the organizers said.On Friday, the Workers Party opened its first congress in 36 years in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, but the timing was coincidental, said Uwe Morawetz, the chairman of the International Peace Foundation. He said that the South Korean ambassador in Bangkok had asked that the trip be delayed until after the congress, which is a major propaganda event for North Koreas top leader, Kim Jong-un, but that the organizers had declined to do so because the visit had been planned long in advance.The Obama administration made no attempt to discourage the trip, Mr. Morawetz said.The laureates gave lectures at the isolated countrys top universities, all in Pyongyang: Kim Il-sung University, Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, and Kim Chaek University of Technology. At the news conference on Saturday, the laureates described highly motivated students who were hindered in part by their governments policies.The best thing we found was that the students were knowledge-hungry, said Mr. Ciechanover, a professor at Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, who shared the Nobel for chemistry in 2004. The English was striking. In two of the three universities we did not need translation.But the Norths restrictions on the Internet made it virtually impossible for the students to progress, the scientists said. The level of research was less than basic, Mr. Ciechanover said.Student researchers had access to a so-called e-library through which they could ask supervisors for documents from the web, which would then be sent to them through the universitys internal Internet system, the scientists said.One students work, on adapting a herbicide for spraying on crops, showed such promise that Mr. Ciechanover said he had invited him to his institute in Haifa. Similarly, Mr. Roberts, a British citizen who shared the Nobel for medicine in 1993, said he had invited a student to his laboratories in Massachusetts. The United States government might need some prodding to allow that student into America, he said.The North Korean authorities, asked whether the students could come to Israel and the United States, said students would only be allowed to travel outside the country in pairs, Mr. Roberts said. That rule is meant to discourage defections.The laureates are unlikely to have met average North Koreans during their trip. University students, particularly at prestigious campuses in Pyongyang, are screened for loyalty to the government, and foreign visitors are typically accompanied by government minders.North Koreas nuclear weapons program was not discussed during the visit, said Mr. Morawetz, who said he had deliberately chosen Nobel laureates for the visit who were not involved in physics or nuclear research.But the laureates suggested Saturday that the United Nations sanctions imposed on the North because of its nuclear program should be eased. At the Okryu Childrens Hospital in Pyongyang, a showcase medical center that  Kim Jong-un visited during its construction in 2013, Mr. Ciechanover said that there were 300 beds and a capacity for 300 outpatients, but that doctors administered only about 60 tests a day, a low figure that he attributed to the sanctions. Doctors faced shortages of medicine and took the view that you give only what you have to, he said.The United Nations sanctions do not apply to medicine, but they restrict the Norths access to foreign currency, and the government is known to channel its limited resources toward the military.The laureates suggested that the sanctions, which were tightened in March in response to North Koreas fourth nuclear test in January, would not lead to regime change or to the Norths abandoning its nuclear weapons. They say: We are self-sufficient. We dont need you. I got the impression they make them stronger, Mr. Ciechanover said, referring to the sanctions.The International Peace Foundation usually receives corporate sponsorship for its work in Asia, but the North Korea trip failed to attract backing, Mr. Morawetz said. The laureates paid their own airfare and were provided accommodation in guesthouses by the North Korean government, he said."}
{"text": "Its only natural that Barack Obama, entering the homestretch of his presidency, would be concerned about his legacy. Judging from a recent interview in The New York Times Magazine, getting credit for the actions he has taken on economic issues seems to be of special interest to him.Mr. Obama expressed frustration that many middle-class Americans feel theyve been left behind during his time in office. The wealthiest Americans, meanwhile, have become richer during the Obama years.There is a lot about this problem of income inequality  and about the economy over all  that Mr. Obama cannot control. Still, there is something he could do right now to help narrow the widening gulf between rich and poor.In one deft move, Mr. Obama could instruct officials at his Treasury Department to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that allows managers of private equity and hedge funds to pay a substantially lower federal tax rate on much of their income.Forcing these managers to pay ordinary income taxes on the gains they reap in their funds would accomplish two things. It would take away an enormous benefit enjoyed almost exclusively by some of the countrys wealthiest people. And, tax experts say, it would generate billions in revenue to the government each year, though there are wide differences over exactly how much.But doesnt changing the carried interest loophole require an act of Congress? Not according to an array of tax experts. Just as Mr. Obamas Treasury Department recently changed the rules to curb corporate inversions, in which companies shift their official headquarters to another country to lower their tax bills, the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, and his colleagues could jettison the carried interest loophole.Alan J. Wilensky is among those urging such a change. He was a deputy assistant Treasury secretary in charge of tax policy in the early 1990s when the carried interest loophole came about.This is something President Obama can do and should do, Mr. Wilensky said in an interview. This is not an impossible thing to get done.Now a lawyer in Minneapolis, Mr. Wilensky recently wrote an article on this topic for Tax Notes, the definitive publication on national and global tax issues.Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego, is another who has recommended that the Treasury get rid of the unjust tax treatment on carried interest. Mr. Fleischer, a contributor to The New York Times, has also estimated how much money such a change would bring to the Treasury.Its something that Obama could accomplish and, to be honest, Im not entirely sure why the Treasury hasnt taken an interest in it, Mr. Fleischer said in an interview. In fact, there is quite a bit of revenue at stake. And doing this on carried interest would cement Obamas legacy in substance as well as symbolically.Rachel McCleery, a Treasury spokeswoman, said in a statement that closing the carried interest loophole has been a priority for the Obama administration from the outset and that the department is continuing to explore its existing authority for ways to address the loophole.But the department cannot eliminate the carried interest tax benefit by itself, she contended.The presidents first budget in 2009  and every one since  has included a proposal to close this unfair loophole and weve been pushing Congress to get it done, she added. No one should be able to play by a different set of rules, so its time for Congress to act to close the carried interest loophole once and for all.The provision has come under repeated political attack. During the current presidential campaign, all three remaining candidates  Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  have called for eliminating it. A number of lawmakers tried to get rid of the carried interest tax benefit beginning in 2007; by 2010, it looked as if the special treatment would go by the boards.But a lobbying campaign by the financial industry, supported by a number of influential Republican lawmakers who argued that carried interest should be ended only as part of a broader tax overhaul, put a stop to the effort.The Treasurys recent action on corporate inversions is encouraging, Mr. Wilensky said. But he acknowledged that it was easier to get rid of a tax rule that benefits faceless corporations than it was to abolish a regulation that enriches a small group of extremely powerful and vocal people.Hedge fund and private equity managers are really the one-tenth of the 1 percent, and the carried interest rule hits their pocketbooks directly, Mr. Wilensky said. Its much easier to implement regulations that have an adverse effect on anonymous shareholders and institutions.Managers of hedge funds and private equity funds receive two types of payments. One, paid annually, represents a percentage of assets under management, usually around 2 percent. Those earnings are taxed as ordinary income.But these managers also receive 20 percent of gains that their funds generate over time, known as carried interest. These profits are taxed at the lower capital gains rate, thanks to a 1993 ruling by the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.Closing the loophole, tax experts say, would involve characterizing both the 20 percent and the 2 percent as income from services rendered.In a 2008 paper, Two and Twenty: Taxing Partnership Profits in Private Equity Funds, and in a follow-up paper published last year, Mr. Fleischer described the current carried interest tax treatment as a conversion of labor income into capital gain, an anomaly that was contrary to some generally accepted principles of tax policy.It is odd, he argued, to treat such partnership profits more favorably than other economically similar methods of compensation, such as partnership capital interests, restricted stock or at-the-money nonqualified stock options (the corporate equivalent of a partnership profits interest).Mr. Fleischers solution would be to tax carried interest at ordinary income rates if the amount of capital contributed to a partnership by tax-exempt entities exceeds the amount of capital contributed by the service provider, or manager. Tax-exempt entities, such as public pension plans and college endowments, are big investors in private equity and hedge funds.In last years paper, Mr. Fleischer noted that a close reading of legislative history from 1984 shows that Congress expected that the managers of an arrangement like a modern private equity fund would be taxed at ordinary rates. In addition, Congress allowed the Treasury Department broad discretion on such matters and directed it to write regulations, Mr. Fleischer said.Financial officials in Britain have already started to trim beneficial treatment for carried interest. They have cut back on what qualifies for the lower, long-term tax rate.Beyond fairness, theres another compelling reason for Mr. Obama to act on this inequity: It could generate $150 billion in revenue over 10 years, by Mr. Fleischers estimate. Two-thirds of that would come from the financial industry; the rest would be generated by real estate, oil and gas partnerships and mining companies, he said.(Mr. Fleischers prediction, though, is far larger than the Congressional Budget Offices official estimate, which is close to $18 billion over 10 years.)Whatever the correct amount, the best reason to eliminate this tax break for the wealthy is that it would help narrow the gap between rich and poor in America. The carried interest loophole contributes substantially to the increase in top-end inequality in the United States, Mr. Fleischer has concluded.If these experts are right, Mr. Obama can direct the Treasury to end what is an enormous subsidy for the wealthiest Americans. The Treasury disagrees. But punting this task to Congress means nothing is likely to be done. And thats too bad."}
{"text": "A hundred and twenty-one years ago, the Irish playwright and poet Oscar Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor after withdrawing his writ for criminal libel against the Marquess of Queensberry. Queensberry had left a card for Wilde at his club on which he scribbled to Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite. (Queensberry couldnt spell.) It was put in an envelope by the hall porter and picked up by Wilde several weeks later. In a tragically blind example of early celebrity madness, Wilde challenged Queensberry  the father of his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, nicknamed Bosie  in the courts, only to end up in the dock himself accused of gross indecency and subjected to two of the most scandalous and tragic trials of the times. He was arrested at the Cadogan Hotel.A few years later, I was desperately thinking of ways I could raise money for the film I had written about Wilde, and I suddenly remembered David Hares The Judas Kiss. It was one of my favorite plays. I thought if I could be good in the part of Oscar, who knew, it could be the next step, the missing link to getting my film on the road. I coerced my producer friend Robert Fox into action. We went to see David who agreed to the idea and then Robert put the whole thing together. Pretty soon we were rehearsing The Judas Kiss at the Hampstead Theater in London. It was the summer of 2012.Davids play is an extraordinary portrait of Oscar Wilde etched out of two pivotal scenes in the writers life. The first act takes place at the Cadogan Hotel where Oscar hides after his libel action collapses. For any die-hard Wilde fan, that last afternoon of freedom in a pokey room on the corner of Pont Street is one of the great romantic riddles of the 19th century. (I have slept in that room, by the way. No message. No vibration.) Why does Wilde not run when he has the chance? Does he know that his place in history is being carved as he sits there waiting to be arrested?The second act finds Oscar at the end of the road in a crumbling, rat-infested palazzo outside Naples as his lengthy affair with Bosie finally unravels. A beached whale (Oscar), his butcher (Bosie) and a bit of rough (Galileo, a Neapolitan fisherman) spend one last night tearing each other to shreds as the Bay of Naples shimmers below them jewelled like the scrawny neck of some ageing dowager. A surprise visit from Oscars closest friend, Robbie Ross, brings the drama to a head. The play ends with Oscars face framed in a pool of light. He is literally fading from view, laughing at himself and at life.In the rehearsal room, David Hare watched a chaotic first run as if Armageddon were being revealed. His face was an agonized rictus of horror. Yes  I was all over the place  but so was everyone else. We all huddled like scared geese by the coffee machine during the interval while David and Neil Armfield, our marvelous Australian director, were coiled in a corner whispering  recasting?  but they didnt have to worry.Even if I was a little indistinct, unsure of the lines, less sure of the moves, crashing into the furniture  this is my technique  David did not know, nor did anyone else, that I had ordered the most incredible fat suit from the master of disguise Robert Allsopp, replete with baboon moobs, a wobbling midriff and a marvelous knee-length arse. I would wear it under a tightly laced corset, to squeeze me into the perfect Wildean waddle.Oscars sexual organ would be the key to my performance, and Rob made a Christmas stocking of a thing, with low hanging orbs filled with dried beans. This appendage, squelched inside my trousers, would be visible to the audience. (I had to cut it down a size or two after a couple of previews. It was taking over.) I had an incredible set of dirty teeth (by Fangs) with enlarged gums to give my cheeks the Oscar silhouette.I had two amazing wigs from the queen of hair, Alex Rouse, one thick and bouncy for Act I and the other thin and balding for the denouement. I was going to look astonishing as Oscar before I even opened my mouth.Yes, I come from the Marlene Dietrich school of acting. Orson Welles once told me about the day he called Marlene and asked her to be in Touch Of Evil  that afternoon. She jumped out of bed, rushed over to Paramount to consult with her Svengali, Travis Banton (the well-known costumer). Together they ransacked the wardrobe department for a hat and a shawl and a couple of wigs, and then she drove like a wild thing down to the border and shot in the afternoon. I love this approach.Luckily I had slightly more time than Marlene and spent a whole year  between hatching the production and it coming to pass  fine-tuning this look, if not my performance.And sure enough, when I appeared onstage at the dress rehearsal there was a collective gasp. My creaky acting took flight. It was astonishing. Suddenly the role was made for me and I was made for it. A strange theatrical eclipse had occurred.The reviews were good. Audiences were enthusiastic. We booked a tour and a West End transfer and I managed to get the BBC and Lionsgate to take part in my film.Suddenly Wilde was my whole life, and it felt right, like the natural conclusion of something.Gay marriage has just gone through, David Hare said one night, visiting my dressing room before the show. Parliament had voted, and it was splashed over the covers of all the papers. Will you be marrying Henrique?Maybe, I replied cautiously.Of course youre against it, arent you? He had me down for a neocon.I loathe weddings if thats what you mean. Gay or straight.Through the open door, I heard him spreading the news up the stairs to the other dressing rooms, and it suddenly struck me that tonight our play was the most important artistic expression of the times. In the theater, 700 peoples worlds collide each night, but this evening we were all tottering on one of the great tectonic shifts as our whole world was realigned. This is how it suddenly felt.Just a century ago a man  Oscar  could be imprisoned and ruined  killed off, basically  simply for being gay. But tonight a homosexual stood on equal ground with the rest of society, and I was, quite unexpectedly, extremely moved.Sitting in the blue light of the wings in my usual seat, my heart beating as fast as at an opening night, watching the technicians and actors emerge from the darkness in that methodical slow motion peculiar to our trade, I knew it was one of the great moments in my life.I was aware of every minuscule movement in my body  veins gurgling, little muscles twitching, hairs standing up and waving  but also I could feel the whole audience. We were absolutely united. The same thought was crossing all our minds: This was the night to see a play about Oscar Wilde.I hurled myself onto the stage for my first entrance, a theatrical Lazarus back from the grave. I was riding the crest of an invisible wave. Its undertow was the whole history of cruelty  the pillory, the scaffold, the red-hot poker and the burnings at the stake, all the vileness invented by humanity to curb and control the practitioners of the unspeakable sin  it was all tumbling on and Oscar was there in every word, razor sharp, slashing the world down to size, glittering in the lights and crashing against the walls of the theater.For me, Oscar is a kind of Christ figure. In his exile he was  along with that other jailbird, Verlaine  the last of the great 19th-century vagabonds, shuffling from bar to bar on the boulevard, cadging drinks, tragic and comic, a clown with a missing tooth smelling vaguely of sweat and cigarettes. His companions were street urchins and petty criminals. His death in a cheap hotel room in Paris was the final great romantic tableau of the century and started one of the great 20th-century debates. Homosexuality was not even a familiar word until the scandal. Oscar changed that, and the long road began toward recognition and liberty.We are all  the gays, the lesbians, the transgender community  still stalking, tottering and sashaying along it. As he predicted, it has been  will be  streaked with the blood of martyrs, but we have definitely come a long way since that May morning in 1895 when a judge could convict a man to two years of hard labor for being homosexual and get a standing ovation for it.In the three years between the West End and our current revival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, my film has floundered, sunk without a trace, resurfaced and sunk again. People have come and gone. One producer  slightly overweight  making his way down the five flights of stairs from our production office for the fifth time in one day, sweating and ashen, declared that some films just dont want to be made. Well, mine does. We were finally greenlit in March. Eight years later. It has taken more resolve than I knew I had.Meanwhile, The Judas Kiss is opening at BAM. We have new cast members, and it feels like a new play. My journey with Oscar continues."}
{"text": "LAS VEGAS  The disturbing images seem so distant now: the pop-star-turned-cautionary tabloid tale  head shorn, face twisted, umbrella gripped like a police baton as she bashed a paparazzi S.U.V. window. More than eight years after her meltdown, Britney Spears, at 34, appears to be thriving.In September, she announced a two-year, $35 million deal to extend her residency at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino here. Forbes named her the fifth-highest-earning female musician of 2015, ahead of powerhouses like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. And shes been hard at work on her ninth studio album, expected this year.With her television guest spots and a wildly popular, often eccentric Instagram feed featuring her toned abs and adorable sons, Ms. Spears looks like that rare celebrity who has vanquished deep travails to snatch a second chance.Im in a real good place in my life, Ms. Spears told People magazine last year, in an interview about her personal life. Im the happiest Ive ever been.Ms. Spearss team presents her onstage as fully in control, and backstage, as the mastermind of her show, an artist in top form. But that view seems at odds with the conclusions routinely drawn about her at probate court in Los Angeles, where an undisclosed mental illness and substance abuse led her family to take action in 2008.Since then, Ms. Spearss life has been controlled by a court-approved conservatorship, known in other states as a guardianship, designed for people who cannot take care of themselves.According to the arrangement, which is typically used to protect the old, the mentally disabled or the extremely ill, Ms. Spears cannot make key decisions, personal or financial, without the approval of her conservators: her father, Jamie Spears, and a lawyer, Andrew M. Wallet. Her most mundane purchases, from a drink at Starbucks to a song on iTunes, are tracked in court documents as part of the plan to safeguard the great fortune she has earned but does not ultimately control.While the conservators are widely credited with rescuing Ms. Spearss career  and her life  her apparent stability and success could belie the need for continuing restrictions.There are recent signs, in fact, that the conservators are now acknowledging the great progress she has made. After successfully fighting to keep her from testifying in at least three prior lawsuits  (a probate judge had previously agreed that doing so could cause her irreparable harm)  Ms. Spearss conservators allowed her to testify on Monday in a case filed against her by a former self-described manager. They agreed that giving such testimony is not likely to cause harm to her, according to court papers.Could this be the start of a major unfastening of the strictures she lives under?Neither the conservators nor her managers or lawyers will discuss her status, and Ms. Spears did not respond to multiple requests seeking an interview.While it is not possible to get an accurate sense of someones mental state from afar, Ms. Spearss friends and former associates said in interviews that, for her, the conservatorship has become an accepted fact of life  not a cage but a protective bubble that allows her to worry about her true passions: music and her children.If anyone knew the real Britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is, said David Lucado, a former boyfriend whose relationship with Ms. Spears foundered in 2014 amid charges of infidelity that Mr. Lucado denies. And if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over Britneys personal life.Since the conservatorship began, some restrictions have been eased. More far-reaching rollbacks were discussed several years ago but never occurred, according to a person who has been involved in Ms. Spearss care who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Ultimately some of the people who would help to decide whether to end it are the conservators and doctors who now help oversee it, many of whom receive fees from Ms. Spearss estate for their work on her behalf.Ms. Spearss status and progress are measured by a court investigator for her case, who is assigned to file reports on her progress once every other year. (Those under conservatorship are not required to regularly appear in front of a judge after their conservators are appointed.)And should Ms. Spears ask to be released, her cause would probably be led by the man the court appointed to be her chief advocate, a lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III. Mr. Inghams role is, among other things, to ensure that the conservators do not loot her assets, abuse their power or inappropriately restrict her freedom.There has been some debate in California over whether court-appointed lawyers do enough to advocate the rights of those under conservatorship. Just last year, the states Senate Committee on Judiciary noted in a report: In theory the court-appointed counsel should be arguing on the proposed conservatees behalf for a less-restrictive alternative to conservatorship whenever possible.Mr. Ingham has been awarded more than $2 million in fees for his work on Ms. Spearss behalf since 2008. This is in addition to the $6.9 million paid from the estate to the conservators and other lawyers who have helped manage Ms. Spearss affairs under the current arrangement. Ms. Spears has never publicly questioned any of these payments, but critics of the process have.As long as she is bringing in so much money and as long as the lawyers and conservators are getting paid, there is little incentive to end it, said Elaine Renoire, president of the National Association to Stop Guardian Abuse, an advocacy group. Usually, the conservatorship just keeps going unless the conservatee makes a fuss or the family does.No one questioned whether Ms. Spears needed help in early 2008; on Jan. 30, her psychiatrist had called for assistance, and when the ambulance left the singers Los Angeles home, it was led by a robust entourage of police vehicles.For days, Ms. Spears had been behaving bizarrely, speaking in a British accent and driving at breakneck speeds. Now she was strapped to a gurney en route to U.C.L.A. Medical Center. Helicopters buzzed overhead. It was the second time in less than a month that Ms. Spears had been taken to a hospital by ambulance for an emergency psychiatric evaluation.Anyone watching that day would not have recognized Ms. Spears as the musical phenomenon who, a decade earlier, wide-eyed and 17, had posed in hot pants and bra on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. With hits including Baby One More Time she dominated the charts, and her first four albums sold a combined 30 million copies.But like child stars before her, Ms. Spears encountered the pressures created by sudden fame and wealth. And a rocky personal life did not help. In 2002, her relationship with Justin Timberlake ended. In January 2004, she married a childhood friend from Louisiana in Las Vegas  a union that lasted 55 hours.Nine months later, she married again, this time to Kevin Federline, a local backup dancer. Two years later, in November 2006, after the birth of their second son, she filed for divorce.Drug and alcohol issues fueled her decline. In 2007, Ms. Spears twice entered treatment but each time cut her stay short. The substance abuse would factor in her battle to retain custody of her children. The idea of losing contact with them tormented her, associates said. After being told she had lost custody of them in October 2007, she spent a night sleeping in a parking lot, according to court papers. (She has since worked out a custody arrangement with Mr. Federline.)It clearly wasnt working with her in control of the ship, said Peter Katsis, who was part of her management team in 2007. It was overwhelming for her when she came of age.Just what kind of mental condition afflicts Ms. Spears has never been publicly disclosed. But, whatever the ailment, by 2008 it seemed to have full possession of her. Although divorced, Ms. Spearss worried parents decided their daughter was in crisis.Her father, a former welder, oil worker, cook and a recovering alcoholic, had subjected his family to years of verbal abuse, abandonment and erratic behavior as a result of his heavy drinking, Britneys mother, Lynne Spears, wrote in her 2008 book, Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World.But her parents rebuilt some kind of relationship after Mr. Spears stopped drinking, and they sought to intervene.After days of fasting and praying, Mrs. Spears said, Mr. Spears asked the court to establish a temporary conservatorship for his daughter that would give him broad control over her treatment, visitors, security and daily life. On Feb. 1, 2008, while Ms. Spears was still in the hospital, a judge, Reva G. Goetz, granted his wish.I shuddered to think, Mrs. Spears wrote in her book, describing her worries about those influencing Britney at the time, what depths of desperation we would have to plumb to regain charge of our child.At the outset, Ms. Spears thought of challenging the arrangement, according to Adam Streisand, one of two lawyers whom she spoke to at the time. Mr. Streisand said Ms. Spears told him she was not comfortable with her father as conservator of her finances.It was clear to me that she seemed a bit agitated, Mr. Streisand said. But my sense was that she did have the capacity to pick a lawyer and that she could make a rational decision.The judge, though, citing a recent medical evaluation, said the singer was not capable of hiring her own counsel. Mr. Streisand said he respected the doctors opinion and went away.Britney wanted to oppose the conservatorship, he said, but she was also extremely worried about her kids and seemed to understand that the best thing to do to see her kids was to accept it.By the end of 2008, the conservatorship had been made permanent. By March 2009, Ms. Spears was back on tour.Initially, though, she seemed frustrated by the restrictions.I think its too in control, she said during a 2008 interview with MTV. If I wasnt under the restraints Im under, Id feel so liberated.She continued, Theres no excitement, theres no passion. And then: Even when you go to jail, you know theres the time when youre going to get out. But in this situation, its never-ending.Since then, Ms. Spears has said little publicly about this arrangement.The conservatorship system in California, troubled for decades, has undergone reforms in recent years that were designed to further protect the old and infirm people who are its typical clients.Ms. Spears hardly fits that bill, but this system operates for her the same way as it does for others.Probate judges in California can appoint two kinds of conservators: ones responsible for a persons physical and mental health, and others who are put in charge of the individuals finances.Ms. Spears has both.Her father, 63, is responsible for her physical well-being  making sure she takes her medicine, for example  and manages her estate. He shares the financial oversight with Mr. Wallet, who specializes in conservatorships and probate law.Mr. Spears takes in about $130,000 a year as a conservator and is also reimbursed for the rent on an office he uses. His bills are reviewed and approved by the judge. He has sought only modest increases over the years, though he also requested 1.5 percent of gross revenues from the performances and merchandising tied to Ms. Spearss Las Vegas show. The court, Ms. Spears and her court-appointed lawyer signed off on it.For a time, during 2012, Jason Trawick, then her boyfriend, also served as co-conservator for her personal well-being.As conservator, according to his court filings, Mr. Spearss work has included overseeing and coordinating Britneys [redacted], business, costuming, personal, household stuff, and legal matters (touching upon entertainment, music, other business opportunities, family law issues, the litigation, trial and/or resolution of other disputes, and ongoing litigation and conservatorship matters).He negotiates business opportunities, such as her 2012 stint as a judge on The X Factor, as well as interviews and sponsorships, even the maintenance of vehicles and the custody arrangement for her children.Mr. Spears and his lawyers have also aggressively kept at bay anyone they consider a threat to Ms. Spearss stability, including a former business manager, a former boyfriend and a lawyer who once sought to intervene in her case, all of whom were served with restraining orders.In 2009, after a Spears fan site, BreatheHeavy.com, started a Free Britney campaign critical of the conservatorship, its owner, Jordan Miller, said he received an irate call from Mr. Spears, who threatened to have the website taken down.Speaking today, Mr. Miller says he can understand the lengths her family took.It was a really volatile situation, and they were trying to protect her, he said.The conservators work is monitored by Mr. Ingham, Ms. Spearss veteran court-appointed lawyer.Though the courts typical maximum hourly fee is $250, Judge Goetz awarded Mr. Ingham as much as $475 an hour to represent Ms. Spears, citing an exception in court rules that allows higher fees in cases involving unusual problems requiring extraordinary expertise.Mr. Ingham, who describes himself as a lawyer with expertise in high-profile conservatorship cases, told the court his typical hourly fee is $595.For a time in 2014, Mr. Inghams clients included both Ms. Spears and Casey Kasem, the radio personality, then 82, who was also in a conservatorship until his death that year; his wife was challenging the size of the lawyers legal bills. Mr. Ingham said the case was particularly complicated, but Mrs. Kasems lawyer at one point accused Mr. Ingham of padding his bills, a charge the judge dismissed.Mr. Ingham declined to comment. Ms. Spears is not known to have ever questioned any of Mr. Inghams fees.The rules for  meeting Britney are tight. No selfies. No autographs. No invading her personal space.Each night before Ms. Spears appears in her Piece of Me show at Planet Hollywoods Axis Theater here, she poses for photos with fans backstage, maintaining her brand at a time when her public appearances and interviews are rare and tightly controlled. (Interviewers who are approved seldom mention the conservatorship.) The meet-and-greet packages start at $1,500 and include a backstage tour led by a longtime Spears employee.Britney is very shy, Felicia Culotta, the V.I.P. coordinator, said on one night last year. I know yall find that very hard to believe  she goes out on that stage, and she is a powerhouse. But she is extremely shy.Britney plays off energy, Ms. Culotta added. If you go in scared of her, she is going to be scared of you. So dont be scared of her. Shes very normal.The routine and consistency of her Las Vegas residency  typically three shows a week for six weeks followed by six weeks off  are a good fit for a mother of two looking to avoid the grind of a tour.During her 90 minutes onstage, Ms. Spears recycles two dozen hits into an act that features backup dancers, pyrotechnics and showers of confetti. She changes costumes repeatedly. At one point, she jumps in a harness from a 31-foot-tall tree. During each performance, a man or woman picked from the audience is strapped into a leather bondage harness and forced to creep across the stage on all fours.On this night, Ms. Spears, in a bustier, held the leash on a man. Your ass is out of this world! she screamed.To be sure, the show does not showcase the Britney of old: Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets. Her vocals are largely prerecorded, and the lip-syncing can lapse. She seems to be doing a job, but a good job, and there is no arguing that the show is doing well: It often fills the Axis, the largest theater on the Strip.Ms. Spears splits her time between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, where her sons are in school, often taking the one-hour flight back after a weekday performance.She and her children are spotted around town in Las Vegas  by the Planet Hollywood pool or at the Sonic Drive-In near the Strip. (The fast food outlet was the hub of Kentwood, La., the small town where Ms. Spears grew up.)In addition to the residency, Ms. Spearss next album, her first since 2013, is expected this summer. For months, she has teased her new music  a single, Make Me (Oooh), is due in May  and logged studio time with hot songwriters. Online, she has promoted herself in photos as a sexy pop star back in fighting shape.Honestly, Im just particular with this record, she told V, the magazine. Its my baby, and so I really want it done right.Music is only one part of the business of being Britney Spears these days. More than a dozen interconnected businesses, including profitable lines of lingerie and perfume, are overseen by the conservators.Occasionally the businesses and Ms. Spears are sued.When a company, Brand Sense Partners, sued Ms. Spears in 2011, in a dispute over a licensing agreement for one of her fragrances, its lawyer at the time, Geoffrey A. Neri, argued that the singer had to be capable of testifying. He pointed out in court papers that she takes care of her children, makes numerous public appearances and was then on a 79-date tour across much of the world.The notion that Britney Spears is mentally or emotionally unfit to testify under oath is a sham, Mr. Neri wrote.But in that case and two others, Judge Goetz ruled the singer too fragile, mentally, to testify. The judge, now retired, declined an interview request; the case has since been transferred to a new judge.On Monday, after years of maintaining that the singer was too vulnerable to be questioned, her conservators consented to a deposition by Ms. Spears in a lawsuit filed against her and her father by Sam Lutfi, an associate from the time of her breakdown. (He claims Ms. Spears owes him money, asserting she made an oral agreement in 2007 to have him serve as her manager and that her father assaulted him.)Despite an attempt by the conservators to separate Ms. Spears and Mr. Lutfi during her testimony  his physical presence in the same conference room as Ms. Spears poses serious risks to her well-being, they argued in court filings  both parties were present for her deposition, which lasted about four hours.Ms. Spears, in a magenta blazer and pearls, testified without incident in Mr. Lutfis presence, even snacking on a cookie during a down moment.Soon after, she was back to posting on Instagram, including an image that read, All energy is contagious. Hundreds of supportive comments flooded in from fans seemingly well aware of the latest legal twist in her life.You have gone through hell and back again but you have persevered every time, one wrote. You got this."}
{"text": "As Vanessa Ives in the Showtime series Penny Dreadful, the French actress Eva Green has been possessed by demons, spoken in tongues, fallen in love with a werewolf and defied the Devil. What on earth can happen to her character next? Something scarier: therapy.Yes, in Season 3, now underway, the impenetrable Miss Ives visits a alienist, who bears a strange resemblance to a character from Season 2. I always think, no, it cant get darker, said Ms. Green, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for the role. But, well, you dont know with this character whether its all in her head.The show, set in Victorian England, incorporates characters from classic British novels of the era  Dr. Frankenstein and his monsters, Dorian Gray and Dracula  to creepy, head-spinning ends. I love playing a character from those repressed times who is so nonconformist, its very jubilating, Ms. Green said. Being possessed, sometimes, its very freeing.Ms. Green, 35, grew up in Paris and worked in theater before making her screen debut in 2003 in Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers, later appearing as the double agent Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond movie, Casino Royale. Later this year, she will appear in Tim Burtons Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children.In an interview at a hotel in London, Ms. Green, dressed all in black, was warm and, unlike Vanessa, smiled a lot. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.When you were cast as Vanessa, did you know youd have epic sequences of demonic possession  projectile vomiting and mowing down men and furniture?I love all that! I prefer doing it to light stuff. There is something very physical about it, which is fun. But its true that its really intense, like a drug, or a sport. Sometimes, after shooting, I go home and lie on the sofa with a glass of red wine and cant move.Is it hard to speak in tongues in that scarily deep voice?The first season, I was very serious about it. I learned some Latin, Arabic, German and Lingala, a Congolese dialect. But then some linguists created the Verbis Diablo for Season 2. I was very good for an episode. Then I just made it all up and took my voice down an octave or two.French is your first language, but youve mostly worked in English.I have only done one movie in French, and it was terrible. Id love to do another, but Im scared. Playing in another language means you get out of yourself somehow. I worked really crazily to sound British when I did the Bond movie, but Im a nerd like that.When did you decide you wanted to act?I was very shy  I still am actually  and my school forced me to do a theater class when I was 12 because they thought it would be good for me. My mother was an actress, but she stopped when she had children, and she would always tell me it was a cruel business. I went to drama school but thought I wanted to become a director. Then I started to act and really felt alive. And here I am.What are some of your career goals?I would love to do something with Jacques Audiard [Rust and Bone]. I once wrote him a letter, but perhaps he doesnt think Im right. People often see me as sophisticated, or put me in the supernatural box.What was it like to work with Tim Burton on Miss Peregrine?He was really lovely. The film is about lots of strange children with unique characteristics, and Im the guardian who protects them from the outside world. There is some darkness, but its very fanciful, crazy, with funny moments. Its very poetic, very Tim.Whats in store for Vanessa in Season 3?Vanessa has lost her faith, but deep down there is a longing. She meets Dr. Sweet [a zoologist] in the first episode, and she will fall in love, but its weird. Its a Penny Dreadful kind of relationship, what can I say?"}
{"text": "Two superstar Chinese pianists of the same generation but with quite different personalities, Lang Lang, 33, and Yuja Wang, 29, come to Carnegie Hall this week. On Wednesday, May 11, Mr. Lang, who combines stupendous technique with theatrical flair, is soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by its dynamic music director Yannick Nzet-Sguin, playing Rachmaninoffs less-heard, youthful First Concerto. After intermission, Mr. Nzet-Sguin conducts Mahlers Symphony No. 10 in Deryck Cookes much-debated performing edition that includes the British scholars completion of the last three movements, which were left in sketchy states by the composer.Ms. Wang, who has comparable brilliance along with taste and lucid musicality, appears in recital at the hall on Saturday. She offers a substantive and serious program, with two Brahms Ballades, Schumanns fantastical Kreisleriana suite and Beethovens mighty Hammerklavier Sonata. (212-247-7800; carnegiehall.org.)"}
{"text": "It was, in a very real sense, the end of an era: On Saturday afternoon, James Levine conducted his final performance in the orchestra pit as music director of the Metropolitan Opera, the position he was appointed to in 1976.Emotion ran high throughout the performance, a matinee of Mozarts Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail that was broadcast live on the radio on the last day of the Mets season. Mr. Levine, 72, who agreed to retire at the end of the season for health reasons after struggling to retain his post, received lengthy applause before each act, including a prolonged standing ovation before the beginning of the third.But after the final curtain, the weight of the moment was the most palpable. As the members of the cast came out for their curtain calls, they seemed more interested in applauding Mr. Levine than in receiving applause themselves. And the audience did not seem to want to let the afternoon end: The loudest cheers for Mr. Levine came after the singers had left the stage.Many could not see the man they were cheering: Since Mr. Levine has conducted for the past few seasons from a motorized wheelchair, he could not make it from the pit to the stage in time for curtain calls. So once the first members of the audience rose to give him an ovation, Mr. Levine, still in the pit, could no longer be seen by most of the audience members who had been sitting in the orchestra seats.But the ovation continued, and soon the cast returned and led the audience in a long, rhythmic clap.Although it was Mr. Levines last performance as music director in the pit of the opera house he has helped shaped for decades, it will not be his last of the season. He will lead the Met Orchestra in concerts later this month at Carnegie Hall, culminating in a performance of excerpts from Wagners Ring cycle, a specialty of his. And he is scheduled to return to the Met next season to conduct several operas  as music director emeritus."}
{"text": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the weeks news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.Mike: Good morning, Farhad! Im gearing up and researching my route to start delivering food for the Timess new meal kit service. Can you help strap a few more foie gras packets to my back?Farhad: Mike, I know youre really passionate about getting traffic to your stories, but Ive warned you before  our readers do not want you showing up to their homes with food.Mike: Im still trying to pitch my cook-and-eat mayonnaise sandwiches just like the ace reporter Mike Isaac marketing campaign. No response yet, but fingers crossed.Anyway, on with the show. Lets do a superquick rundown of the week in tech.This week, you argue in your column that Apple should fail more to ultimately win, a professional tactic that seems to have suited you quite well.And Google is teaming up with Fiat Chrysler to equip a fleet of minivans with self-driving technology, making this the most dad-core rollout of autonomous vehicles in the history of Silicon Valley.Farhad: Finally, a tech company is thinking of fathers. I hope this sets off a trend. Maybe Spotify will offer a music subscription plan that plays only Billy Joel, Coldplay, U2 and Foo Fighters? Or maybe Twitter will roll out a feed of the best dad jokes? Oh, wait, never mind  that already exists.Mike: Thank you, resident dad. And lastly, a bunch of ex-journalists turned Facebook employees turned ex-Facebook employees leaked just how questionable Facebooks practices around selecting trending content seem to be, which was not a good look for Facebook. Gizmodos scoop is well worth the read.But this week we wanted to try something new, right? Instead of a deep dive into one tech topic, were going to do a short list, mostly because millennials love lists.Farhad: Yup, exactly. I know that we planned to do a list called 14 Reasons Mike Looks Up to Farhad, but I actually worried wed run out of space. So I had another idea. We both encounter a lot of technology in our daily lives  for me during the course of reporting, for you to escape bounty hunters. So I was thinking that we could both list a couple of our most-hated products or services in tech. What gadget gets you really steamed, Mike?Mike: My most-hated tech product has to be the popularization of the rugged Bluetooth speaker designed to clip to ones belt loop, essentially a modern take on the boombox, but 10 times more obnoxious.Its marketed as an outdoorsy-type thing, something to take to the beach, or camping or, in your case, glamping. Imagine yourself scaling Mount Everest and listening to Sugar Ray at the peak! the ad copy (probably) goes. The tunes stream from your iPhone to the speaker, which sounds just as tinny and terrible as you would think.I never really saw them around on the street until I moved to San Francisco. Now I mostly see them on cyclist dudes, at least two of whom were smoking pot and blazing through stop signs, I kid you not. Im walking down the sidewalk and all of a sudden Im getting low-quality audio blared at me. Its like being accosted by a drive-by Sublime album.Farhad: I guess I agree, except when those dudes are blasting some sweet dad tunes. Like imagine if that guy was playing the Eagles? Id stop him, shake his hand, put my lighter in the air and wave my arms gently back and forth, marveling at the wonders of the universe.Anyway, you know what I hate? The iPhone charging cable. Its called Lightning, though a better name would be Fraying. Im lucky if I get six months out of these cables before they start acting up  usually the connector begins separating from the cable or you get a kink in the line that begins to crack, and soon your phone stops charging. I hate it. Will someone please make a superstrong charging cable, please?Mike: I am totally with you there. I have a drawer full of cheap Chinese knock-off Lightning cables, and they all work for a day and then bust. If I buy the real $30 one from Apple, it still goes bad in less than a year. Forget the annual new iPhone events, I want the company to hold an ultimate, indestructible Lightning cable event.Heres something else that I wanted to like, but actually hate: streaming, stationary digital cameras like those offered by Nest for the home.I really liked the whole safety and security pitch at first. When I lived in New York, the editors unfortunately wanted me to leave my house and go into the office to work  something Im pretty sure you have never done in the San Francisco bureau. So setting up a Nest cam to watch my dog while Im gone seemed like a nice idea.Instead, I felt like a creepy voyeur. My dog sat and slept by the door, and watching her made me feel sad. Then when my dog walker  whom I trust and like  came in, I saw him pet my dog and be supersweet with her and do what I always assumed he did normally, which was walk my dog. But not telling him that I was watching him felt like a strange breach of trust, as if I suspected him of something that wasnt ever really warranted.It made me realize how prevalent these cameras are now, and how violated I would feel were I being recorded in, say, my friends homes. My hatred, I guess, is that its so mainstream and theres little I can do to stop it.But at my house, at least, I let my dog have her privacy when Im gone. Its better that way.Farhad: Huh. You seem to be a much bigger hater than me.Lets see, what else do I hate? I hate most hashtags. I can see their value as part of a political campaign or meme  like, #oscarsowhite or #blacklivesmatter  but I hate when people add useless hashtags to their most banal posts.

{"text": "Political leaders take command of situations and carefully consider their options before they act. Thats what most Americans would like to believe, and often, it may be the truth. But its definitely not the case on Veep, especially in Sundays episode, The Eagle.In this weeks comedy of presidential errors, Selina Meyer makes an impulsive, major foreign policy decision by opting to impose sanctions against China. The reason, ostensibly, is that Chinese hackers have breached the servers at the White House. But we know that Selina is actually just doing damage control after publicly blaming the hack for an ill-advised tweet she sent from the POTUS Twitter account. This is how international incidents get started, apparently: not with a bang or even a security breach, but with a direct message accidentally made public.Can I really blame another country for something they didnt do? Selina asks her advisers in what is as close as this administration gets to a strategy meeting.Its been the cornerstone of American foreign policy since the Spanish-American War, replies Ben, her chief of staff.Other cornerstones of American foreign policy, or at least Selinas foreign policy: the kidnapping of schoolteachers instead of terrorists, something the president is briefed on in the Situation Room; tweeting snarky comments about her political rivals while sitting in the Situation Room (this is what starts the whole mess in the first place); and ignoring that matters of national security are at risk until her personal pride is on the line.This season, Veep has been more effective than ever at laying breadcrumbs, and the cybersecurity subplot is a perfect example. Each week, Sue has issued a warning about the Chinese hackers. In Episode 1, she said they had breached the N.S.A. firewall. In Episode 2, they had breached the White House. This week, she announces theyve breached National Security Council servers. And for a third time, Sue is ignored, until a stupid tweet turns the matter into a hair on fire situation.The comedic exclamation point comes when Mike, in the middle of a press briefing, announces that the Chinese have banned foreign adoptions by United States citizens, which means Mike and his wife wont be getting their new baby after all. Every member of the Veep cast is excellent, but each week, theres one actor who stands out. In this episode, its Matt Walsh, who both reacts to that adoption news with effectively quiet heartbreak and exhibits physical comedy skills of John Cleese proportions when he notices Selinas tweet-tastrophe.The threat of exposure has become a running theme throughout this season, one conveyed not only through the hacking story line but also via Catherines continuing effort to make that doc about her mother. For the first time, Selina actually expresses concern about Catherines project but, of course, not because it might expose the incompetence that permeates the Oval Office.Catherine, do not use any of the vulgar parts, she tells her daughter after uttering some of her trademark profanity.But thats, like, all of it, Catherine says. Its a comment that, given the number of obscenities regularly spewed on Veep, feels almost meta.What threatens to derail Selina more than anything is the Eagle himself, Bob Bradley (Martin Mull), the folksy, veteran political adviser. He has become Selinas point-person on the recount and her most prized adviser even though nothing he says makes sense. Again, following the bread crumbs of last weeks episode, Bob reveals himself to be completely senile, so much so that he wanders out of a meeting in which hes supposed to be arguing to delay the recount certification.When Selina remembers that she confessed everything about her hacking cover-up to this man, she realizes shes basically given a shiny-buttoned bomb to a handsy 2-year-old. So she does the only thing she can: She makes him the cybersecurity czar (ah, another czar) and shoves him into a basement office, where he has no cell reception and, presumably, no Wi-Fi. Really, the move could only have been more comedically perfect if Kent  played by Gary Cole, who orchestrated a similar move when he starred in Office Space  had put Bob there himself.Its remarkable that there are any victories for Selina, and yet she ultimately emerges from this episode very much on her feet. Her public appeal has risen slightly because some are so enamored by her now open romance with Charlie Baird. (Its surprising that Selina forgives him so easily for entertaining the idea of becoming Bill OBriens treasury secretary, even though he apologizes repeatedly. Its the one thing in this episode that feels a tad off.) More important, a box of 10,000 ballots is discovered and Karen, Selinas longtime friend and a highly ineffectual lawyer, manages to argue that the certification should be delayed so those votes can be counted.There are two people in Selinas orbit that she should be thanking for that mini-recount victory: Kent, who flagged the possibility that there could be missing ballots while Selina mostly berated him for using too many big words, and Amy, who has kept the trains running in Nevada with zero gratitude from her boss. (Amy also gets the best line of the week after she learns that Dan slept with her sister Sophie because he thought Sophie worked for CBS, when she actually works at CVS. Would you mind stopping at ABC News and picking up some Advil? she asks Dan. Oh did I say ABC News? I meant Rite-Aid.)Last season, Amys frustration with Selina boiled over and she was fired from her post. This season, she has somewhat begrudgingly rejoined the team, only to find shes still underappreciated. If Selina continues to overlook what Amys bringing to the table in the same way she overlooks most things, it seems very possible that our Ms. Brookheimer could lose it again. If she does, surely Catherines camera, if not a Chinese hacker, will be there to capture it."}
{"text": "RAYMIE NIGHTINGALEBy Kate DiCamillo272 pp. Candlewick Press. $16.99. (Middle grade; ages 8 to 12)Perhaps the sincerest aim of any fairy tale is not to introduce young readers to the quixotic pleasures of magic and fantasy but rather to initiate all readers into lifes unspeakable verities: Parents desert families, orphaned children often go hungry, and even the most loyal beloveds are capable of astonishing acts of betrayal. Early on in Kate DiCamillos captivating new novel, Raymie Nightingale, we learn about an older woman who regularly feeds a bevy of swans, seeming like something out of a fairy tale. Ten-year-old Raymie Clarke, an anxious heroine, considers the possibility that its a fairy tale that hadnt been told yet. Thats an irresistible promise to begin a novel with, and DiCamillo is up to the challenge. With its short, vibrant chapters and clear, gentle prose, this triumphant and necessary book conjures the enchantments of childhood without shying away from the fraught realities of abandonment, abuse and neglect.Set during the summer of 1975, Raymie Nightingale features an unlikely threesome of girls who bond over a series of disastrous baton-twirling lessons as they prepare to vie for the fantastic title of Little Miss Central Florida Tire. Raymie, fretful and sensitive, hopes to win the crown, become famous and lure her father, who has run away with a dental hygienist, back home. Louisiana Elefante, an angelic-looking orphan living with her grandmother in penury, sets her wide eyes on the prize money  confident that the winnings will keep her out of the county home and the clutches of the mysterious Marsha Jean. Beverly Tapinski, the unflappable, streetwise daughter of a former beauty queen and a New York City cop, is committed to sabotaging the entire pageant. Louisiana dubs the girls the Three Rancheros, and with their every misadventure and escapade, the Rancheros pledge to rescue one another from their troubled lives.DiCamillo, a former National Ambassador for Young Peoples Literature and the author of the Newbery Honor book Because of Winn-Dixie as well as two Newbery Medal winners, The Tale of Despereaux and Flora and Ulysses, has returned to her Florida roots and to the careful handling of such thorny issues as loneliness and parental desertion. In Raymie Nightingale, DiCamillo uses her light touch and boundless humor to deliver the difficult news that adults are fallible and that children must learn to develop an unwavering sense of self-reliance and self-acceptance. Summoning the wit of Flannery OConnor and the sweet melancholy of John Prine, she elegantly connects her characters wild actions to their roiling emotions. She writes with compassion and grace about both childhood traumas and adult transgressions.Along the way, the Three Rancheros search for a missing library book about Florence Nightingale (inspiring the books title); steal a baton; discover the whereabouts of a missing, beloved cat; and develop a tender but hard-earned friendship. Louisiana Elefante, who may or may not be the daughter of famous trapeze artists, is one of DiCamillos most singular and arresting creations. With swampy lungs and an untamed warren of multiplying bunny rabbit barrettes, Louisiana delights on every page. When Louisiana asks her new friends, Have you ever in your life come to realize that everything, absolutely everything, depends on you? the reader understands not only her sorrow but also the vibrant powers of her imagination. Then there is Beverly Tapinski, who makes twirling a baton look easy and impossible at the same time and has already run away from home and made it as far as Atlanta. She is jaded and unimpressed by adult wisdom, yet when she lies about the origins of her black eye and beats the gravel with her new baton, it is impossible not to feel her vulnerability along with the quake of her anger and the fierceness of her still-developing strength.But it is Raymie Clarke, with her ever-expanding soul, her pluck and fortitude, who succeeds at something far bigger than any Little Miss competition. Though Raymies absent father ironically sells family insurance  his receptionist answers the phone with Clarke Family Insurance. How may we protect you?  DiCamillo tackles the ever-present uncertainty of whether any family can be protected from separation or disaster. By learning to make new friends and to trust in her friendships, Raymie comes into a powerful sense of self-knowledge. She is a terrific model for young readers and adult readers alike.Twirling a baton requires flair and confidence, in addition to an understanding that the baton is always balanced just a tiny bit off-center. There is something wonderfully off-balance, too, about DiCamillos storytelling. It allows her characters to sparkle and soar. DiCamillo has called this novel, based partly on her own fatherless Florida childhood, the absolutely true story of my heart. What a beautiful and generous heart it is."}
{"text": "IT is easy to laugh at the proverbial black friend invoked to neutralize charges of racism. However, the humor sours when you realize that this comical ploy is also a strategy the Republican Party uses in its outreach to black and moderate white voters.Despite the whiteness of the G.O.P. in general  about 90 percent of voters in the Republican primaries this year have been white  a number of black Republicans hold prominent positions in the party, and are often held up as evidence of its commitment to diversity. Last year, for example, when the presidential candidate Ben Carson was doing well in the polls, his presence on the campaign trail helped prompt the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, to claim that the G.O.P. was likely to have the most diverse presidential primary field in history  of either party.Promoting black Republicans in this fashion may or may not succeed in convincing white voters that the party is not as racially divisive as it can seem. But less appreciated is the effect that this approach has on black voters. As recent research of mine suggests, the image of black Republicans that the G.O.P. disseminates may actually dampen enthusiasm for the party  not only among the black electorate in general, but also among black Republicans themselves.A common thread that links high-profile black Republicans like Mr. Carson is their commitment to colorblind politics. You can also see this with recently elected politicians like Representative Mia Love of Utah and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. They acknowledge that being black is part of their life experience but reject the idea that racial identity should orient their political decision making. They often decry efforts, like affirmative action, to address racial inequality explicitly, claiming that such policies undermine black success.Though colorblind black Republicans get a lot of attention, they fail to represent an important, if overlooked, type of black Republican, which I call race conscious.I began studying the experiences of black activists in the Republican Party in 2006. In addition to monitoring their online presence, I attended political rallies, organizational meetings, conferences and panel discussions. I also spent time interviewing about 50 black Republicans involved in state and local politics across the nation who were often trying to persuade black voters to consider voting Republican.What I found was at odds with the message of most black Republicans in the public eye. These race-conscious Republicans saw themselves as closely linked to a broader black community, and most experienced this connection as empowering. They were committed to conservative politics as a tool for the uplift of the black community. While they supported most Republican policy positions, their motivations were grounded in their black identity.For instance, in their view, the virtue of school vouchers was not the free-market approach to education but rather the empowerment of black parents. They championed smaller government as a way of stemming the influence of white bureaucrats in black communities. One activist described his support of Republican politics as a way to achieve Black Power through conservative principles.These Republicans expressed skepticism about G.O.P. outreach efforts and said they rarely felt their opinions were supported within the party. They sensed that while party leaders might want more black faces, the party was less interested in tailoring conservative messages to address the racial identity of black voters. One activist explained to me that the party is not willing to get out there and advertise what they are doing today that greatly, positively impacts the lives of black folks. As a result, despite their activism, these Republicans found themselves sitting on the sidelines while their colorblind counterparts were given all the playing time.How many race-conscious black Republicans are there? Unfortunately, since fewer than 10 percent of blacks identify as Republican, there is little reliable quantitative information about black Republicans.Still, the available data imply that among black Republicans, racial identification is strong. The 2012 American National Election Survey suggests that more than 50 percent of blacks who identify as Republican see their fate as tied up with that of other black Americans. That finding was based on a small sample size, but combined with the experiences of my interviewees, it seems to indicate that the colorblind message promoted by prominent black Republicans is more reflective of what the Republican leadership values than of what black people within the G.O.P. actually feel.The low profile of race-conscious black Republicans should concern anyone within the G.O.P. who is serious about increasing black participation. It should also raise suspicions about the sincerity of Republican outreach efforts.A further problem with the partys approach is that it offers an impoverished conception of what it can mean, and what it can be like, to be both black and a Republican. The message from the current crop of successful black Republicans is that conservative politics is at odds with black identity. The G.O.P. presents a party where you have to choose: Be black or be a Republican. Given that race is an omnipresent reality for a vast majority of African-Americans, that is a lot to ask.Republicans leaders like Mr. Priebus talk about the presence of black Republicans as an important component of the inclusive big tent the G.O.P. seeks to create. Yet they persist in promoting black Republicans who espouse a colorblind message that primarily appeals to white voters. This not only suggests to most black voters that the party is inhospitable to their interests; it also ends up silencing black voices within the party."}
{"text": "Midway through A Bigger Splash, the latest hedonistic trip from the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, Ralph Fienness character, Harry, puts on the Rolling Stones Emotional Rescue album and starts to dance. His shoulders twitch, his body flails, and in a sort of drunken ritual set in the middle of a luxurious vacation home on an island off the coast of Sicily, he tears through the house, his awkward movements getting bigger and more daring  the music propelling him into a state of almost fearsome abandon.It is a climactic scene for Harry and the other characters in a film in which the body and its capacity to revel in all the senses  be it through music, food, sex or the heat of volcanic rocks  are pushed to the extreme.Based loosely on the 1969 French New Wave thriller La Piscine, or the The Swimming Pool, the movie, which opened May 4, stars Mr. Fiennes as an outlandish music producer and the ex-lover of Marianne Lane, played by Tilda Swinton. A rock star in the vein of Chrissie Hynde or David Bowie, Marianne has had surgery on her vocal cords and has traveled to the remote island of Pantelleria to recuperate with her current boyfriend, Paul, a much younger filmmaker (Matthias Schoenaerts). But when Harry and his recently discovered daughter, Penelope (a Lolita-esque Dakota Johnson), pay an unexpected visit, much sex, emotional tussling and intrigue ensue on a vacation that goes violently awry.With the migrant crisis looming in the background, the brutal natural beauty of the island becomes a sort of fifth character. But music, particularly by the Stones, also plays an outsize role. I wanted to create a movie that is rooted in the nostalgic world of rock n roll, Mr. Guadagnino said by phone, explaining that Marianne, Paul, Harry and his daughter are the last to enjoy the freedom of the rock n roll revolution, a revolution that was about endless enjoyment, it was meant to never finish. So what happens when the party ends? Or when one person doesnt want it to?The films debut at the Venice Film Festival last year was notably contentious  booed by some Italian viewers who were reportedly displeased with the depiction of a star-struck local police detective but largely impressing English-language critics. There was something fitting about that divided response, A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, since the film is about foreigners behaving badly on Italian soil.Befitting a film about four strong but very different characters, Mr. Guadagnino and his stars each brought ideas to the project that somehow melded into what The Guardian has called a chamber piece of sexual tension.Studiocanal approached Mr. Guadagnino, who is probably best known in the United States for the lush romance I Am Love (2010), also starring Ms. Swinton, about remaking La Piscine as part of an effort to give new life to works in its extensive library. As Ron Halpern, Studiocanals executive vice president for international production, explained the thinking: The film was very iconic but something very pure: four people in a beautiful spot and someone is going to die. Wouldnt it be interesting to see a new version of that movie today? (Fox Searchlight is distributing the film in the United States.)The studio chose Mr. Guadagnino, Mr. Halpern said, because I Am Love dealt with complicated romantic relationships, and it deals with death in this contained sort of rarefied European world. He has the right tone, style and taste, and he doesnt judge his characters.For Mr. Guadagnino, La Piscine was only a jumping-off point. Originally, I wasnt game, he said, acknowledging that he hadnt even finished watching the original when he started on his adaptation. But he soon saw the project as another opportunity to use sensual experiences to explore the unspoken aspects of relationships.Ms. Swinton helped put the emphasis on the spoken and unspoken when, as a condition of participating, she insisted her character be unable to talk. I suggested this to him as a challenge, she said. She thought the initial script had too much dialogue. She didnt want it to be about two articulate people throwing words at each other.She added, I like the idea of that kind of mess and the human disruption that not speaking would bring.She added: At the same time, the challenge to me was what is it you need to say? Every scene was an endurance test, trying not to talk or trying to endure Harrys relentlessness. But by not talking, she could maybe interrupt in a different way.For Mr. Fiennes, the movie let him indulge in a lack of constraint. Harry was a very liberating part to play, he said. Hes someone who doesnt want to be contained by social norms, which is maddening to everyone else, alternatingly fascinatingly maddening and fun all at the same time.For the dance scene, a choreographer helped loosen him up, and they practiced in a cinema on the island. The physical release, he said, was essential. We all have the potential to be monsters, but we recognize the monstrosity within us and still have compassion and kindness. Theres something very Dostoyevsky about it.Ms. Johnson also described Penelope as a dark little monster of a girl, but took pains to avoid completely sexualizing her. I wanted the contrast between her behaving like an adult and playing with these adults emotions, she said, but also feeling very young and alone and scared.The island brought out the characters darker sides. When people go on vacation, Ms. Johnson said, they let their guards down. Its as though theyre on another planet, they lose their minds and behave like animals.That setting up of an atmosphere and marinating the audience in it, Ms. Swinton said, is central to Mr. Guadagninos approach. Luca and I long ago coined for ourselves an approach, to give the audience a place to hear or smell or taste, thats very much a part of his work.She likened the film to creating a novel, after awhile, people are in it. She added: Youre not just looking at the screen, youre reaching for the sun cream. Thats Luca."}
{"text": "AMERICA is experiencing a population boom  of pets. Driven by rising disposable income and urbanization and by evolving attitudes toward animals, the number of pets has grown more rapidly since the mid-1970s than the human population, to the point where there are now about as many pets as there are people.We dont just buy pets as never before, we also treat them differently. More animals are living in our houses and are given over to a life of leisure. Animals are spoken of as family members  and not just dogs and cats, but rabbits, rats, bearded dragons and snakes. We feed them scientifically formulated organic diets and take them to veterinary specialists of all stripes. Veterinarians and psychologists describe these changing practices as evidence of a deepening human-animal bond.Let me confess up front that I have taken an active part in the pet-keeping bonanza. I grew up with a menagerie of pets and, as a mother, was determined to provide my daughter with the same joyful experiences. Indeed, I was so indulgent that by the time my daughter was in elementary school our house was known as the neighborhood zoo. Now that she is a teenager, weve vastly reduced the census of animals in our home, but we still live with two dogs. I cant imagine life without them.Regardless, I have become increasingly uncomfortable with the very notion of pet. Scientists studying animal cognition and emotion are continually peeling back the mysteries of animal minds, revealing an incredible and often surprising richness in the thoughts and feelings of other creatures.For instance, the more Ive learned about goldfish  they are more intelligent than we think, feel pain and engage in socially complex behaviors  the guiltier I feel that I subjected several of these creatures to a life of endless tedium, swimming circles in a small bowl on my daughters dresser.When I came upon the conclusion by the University of Tennessee ethologist Gordon Burghardt that the best we can do for captive reptiles and other animals is a life of controlled deprivation, I wished I had never bought Lizzy, our leopard gecko. I felt a pit in my stomach when I learned that Lizzys perpetual clawing at the glass wall of her tank was most likely a manifestation of captivity-induced stress. We had basically been torturing her, and it is perhaps not surprising that she died after only two years, despite our efforts to give proper care.Like me, well-meaning pet owners may unwittingly cause harm by keeping animals in captive environments that might not meet their behavioral needs, such as a small bowl for a lone goldfish or a 10-gallon glass tank with fake vines for a leopard gecko. I assumed, during the days of my pet-buying frenzy, that pet stores would sell only tanks and cages that provided appropriate housing for the animals they sell. But I was wrong. Some of these habitats hardly deserve the name. A current trend in aquariums, for example, is the so-called nano-tank, a fish habitat designed to fit nicely on the corner of a desk (complete with USB plug-in, for your convenience). The tanks are sleek, but woe to the fish expected to live its entire life in six cups of water.The way the pet industry advertises and sells animals gives the impression that having a pet is easy and fun, and that pets themselves are cheap and disposable toys. You can, for instance, stop at the pet store at the mall and, for $20, buy a brightly painted hermit crab, complete with a cage that would fit on a 5-by-7-inch index card. Yet did you know that the recommended size tank for adequate hermit crab welfare is at least 10 gallons? Or that hermit crabs, despite their name, are actually social creatures that live in large colonies? Or that the hermit crabs sold at the mall have most likely been plucked from their wild home, since they dont breed well in captivity? That hermit crabs can live 30 years or longer? That they probably feel pain?The ethical problems with the various small creatures we stuff into cages and tanks are relatively clear-cut. The more challenging moral questions, in my view, arise in relation to our closest furry friends: dogs and cats. Unlike animals that must spend their entire life in a cage or that must struggle to adapt to a human environment, most cats and dogs have it pretty good. Many have the run of our homes, share in many of the activities of their human families, and may even have opportunities to form social relationships with others of their kind. They have lived in close contact with humans for thousands of years and are well adapted to living as our companions. They can form close bonds with us and, despite species barriers, can communicate their needs and preferences to us, and we to them.Yet the well-being of our cats and dogs is perhaps more compromised than most of us would like to admit. There are, of course, the obvious systemic problems like cruelty, neglect, abandonment, the millions wasting away in shelters waiting for a forever home that will never materialize or whose lives are snuffed out because they dont or cant behave the way a good pet should. But even the most well-meaning owner doesnt always provide what an animal needs, and it is likely that our dogs and cats may be suffering in ways we dont readily see or acknowledge. We can too easily forget that although we have an entire world outside our home, we are everything to our animals.How many dogs, for instance, are given lots of attention inside a home, but rarely get outside? How many spend their weekdays inside and alone, while their owners are at work, save for the one or two times a dog walker or neighbor drops by for a few minutes to feed them and take them out briefly? Is it going too far to suggest that these dogs are suffering?In addition to love, a dog or cat owner also has to have time, space, energy, patience, money and a strong sense of commitment to being there for and with their animal. The choice of being a pet owner is rarely thrust upon us unexpectedly. Saying no is often the most responsible option.If we buy fewer dogs and cats from breeders and pet stores, the pet population boom might gradually taper off, and the numbers of abandoned animals in shelters should start to decline as well.It may be hard to recognize the harmful aspects of pet keeping when all we hear is how beloved pets are, how happy they are to be in our company, and how beautiful and enduring the human-animal bond is. Advertisements showing golden-haired children frolicking with golden-haired puppies and YouTube videos of cats doing hilarious things make pet keeping look ever so precious.Yet if we really care about animals, we ought to look beyond the sentimental and carefully scrutinize our practices. Animals are not toys  they are living, breathing, feeling creatures. Perhaps we can try to step into their paws or claws and see what being a pet means from their perspective. We might not always like what we see."}
{"text": "During an exceptionally cringe-worthy Republican debate in March, Donald J. Trump raised his hands to show people that they werent abnormally small. While it is unclear whether this display settled the underlying matter, one thing was indisputable: He wasnt wearing a wedding ring.Hes not alone. No band adorns the fourth finger of Prince Williams left hand, or that of Graydon Carter, or more recently, of Jay Z. And Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have been spotted without rings, which has added to tabloid speculation about the state of their union.The question remains: Can a naked finger be just a naked finger?Mr. Trump, whose representatives declined to comment or to make him available for this article, has not explained why he no longer wears the band he wore when he and Melania Knauss were married in 2005. The public is undoubtedly aware of his marital status, so hes not exactly putting anything over on anyone. He appeared to not wear a ring during his marriage to Ivana Trump, and only occasionally with Marla Maples as well.As for Jay Z, he and Beyonc, who was seen at the Met Gala sans her wedding ring, have matching tattoos on their ring fingers. Never mind that she just released an album largely about infidelity.Before Prince William married Kate Middleton in 2011, the palace issued a statement, noting that the couple had discussed it and that the princes decision not to wear a ring was personal preference. The statement continued, He doesnt even wear a signet ring  and decided he didnt want to.Popular perception is that some men  and, yes, women too  go ringless in order to broadcast an availability that their spouses may know nothing about. And there are many who subscribe to the notion that affairs may be avoided if both sexes would simply adhere to this public signifier that they are taken. (Of course, this doesnt account for those who are attracted by wedding rings precisely because they signal no possibility of a longer attachment.)I think theyre making a statement by not wearing one, said Jeanne Safer, a psychotherapist in New York. It may unconsciously signal availability for adultery, either actually or in fantasy.Judi Winston Katz, 45, a real estate agent in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., agrees. She believes that ambivalence played a role in her decision not to wear a ring during her 20-year marriage. While her former husband, whom she loved as a best friend, wore his ring right up to the day they signed their divorce papers, she found hers a nuisance and removed it after their first year of matrimony. I always wondered if it was subconsciously because I didnt want to be married to him, she wrote in an email.Just as customs about weddings have become less conventional, so, too, have rules about rings, both in the type of band or whether you wear one at all.Many gay men have exchanged wedding bands, but it may be too soon to say that these rings are here to stay. Dominick Miciotta and Jason Smith of Huntington, N.Y., however, always wear the matching titanium bands they gave each other at their October 2013 wedding. The ring is a part of marriage for both of us, said Mr. Miciotta, 46. We are both fairly traditional. We both feel the same way about commitment and love.In England, the appearance of wedding rings for men is a relatively recent phenomenon. In his 1996 book, Debretts New Guide to Etiquette & Modern Manners, the etiquette expert John Morgan wrote that in Britain it is customary for the bride alone to sport a wedding ring, and although some brides have adopted the Continental habit of presenting the groom with his own band during the vows, this remains not quite comme il faut.In the 16 years that Nick Sullivan, the English-born fashion director of Esquire, has been married, nothing has adorned any of his fingers. While he was very happy to get married, he didnt feel the need for an extra symbol. My wife doesnt care, he said.Neither does Evin Lowe, whose husband, Robert Schwartz, wont wear a ring. For him, though, it is more about trauma. During his first marriage, Mr. Schwartz, 47, who has a consulting business in New York, wore the conventional gold wedding band. After divorcing, he decided that the ring represented a failed marriage and flushed it down the toilet.Before marrying Ms. Lowe, he expressed his reluctance to (literally) put a ring on it. She understood. If I felt like I needed him to wear a ring all the time, I wouldnt have married him, said Ms. Lowe, 41, a lighting technician for film and television. To me its a matter of trust.There are practical reasons for not wearing them. Haim Hazan, 40, the owner of a Manhattan hair salon, finds that rings get in the way of his work. Everybody knows Im married, he said. But its convenient not to wear one.Craig Savel, 53, a developer of computer apps and programs in New York, said, Rings never entered the equation. He and his wife, Marion Stein, eloped to Niagara Falls without rings for either of them. Were two kind of aging hippies, Mr. Savel said. I think were also both afraid we are so ditsy well lose it, with all the attendant symbolism.The way Dr. Safer sees it, going ringless does tend to symbolize that there is something deeper going on  an inability to fully commit or a desire to be free. She and her husband, the historian and writer Richard Brookhiser, have been married for over 30 years and both wear rings.It never occurred to me that we wouldnt, she said. In marriage, she believes, you exchange your pathologies. You should exchange rings, too."}

Ms. Streep won her first Academy Award for the role, which inspired one of her strongest, if not always sympathetic, performances.

Bloods all that matters now, Reid says, taunting a distraught Chris, surrounded by only his stepfamily.Blood ties might be everything in the new world (why else would anyone keep Ofelia around? Zing!), but how relevant are normative family structures? Adolescents and authority figures dont get along under the best, non-zombie circumstances. In a world where no one is in charge, whats keeping teenagers in line?In last weeks episode Nick took off to meet up with Luis, the fixer charged with getting Strand over the border into Mexico. This week, while Madison worries that her son is getting too comfortable handling serious firearms, Nick assures her, I dont mind it out there.Do we worry for a kid who sort of likes the apocalypse? Or does that kid stand the best chance of survival?The more pragmatic Daniel tells Madison that she cannot shelter her family:You have to stop treating them like children.They are.Not anymore.Hes right. Whatever innocence the younger generation of the Abigail had is rapidly dwindling. I think Im actually starting to get used to this, sighs Ofelia. This is what we do now: Spill blood, clean it up, spill it again.Moral compromises are mounting, and nearly everyone is starting to accumulate guilt. Chris worries about his having let Reid on board  that Chris froze instead of shooting a pregnant woman. Madison frets about whether or not shes doing the right thing for her family. Alicia feels guilty for falling for Jacks trick. Travis remembers the young woman and badly burned boy he put in a small boat to be dragged behind the Abigail, only to have Strand cut them loose.That young woman, Alex, was picked up by Connor, and in exchange she offered up everything she knew about the Abigail and its crew. After she and Charlie were cut off from the Abigail, Alex was forced to mercy-kill Charlie and dump his body. When Travis attempts to assuage her guilt  You did what you had to do  Alex is quick to correct him: I did what you made me do.Of course, Travis is no stranger to mercy killings. He put a bullet in Chriss mother, while Chris himself killed a horrifically maimed man in the wreckage of Alexs plane crash. Mercy has taken on a new meaning in the apocalypse, and compassion is often found where theres a warm gun.Point is, everyone has blood on their hands and everyone is trying to figure out how to deal. Even Daniel  well acquainted with his own capacity for violence thanks to his history as a torturer during the Salvadoran civil war  is beginning to crack under the trauma. Take the gun, a disembodied voice tells him.These internal struggles make for intimate drama, certainly not on the same scale as the large set pieces on that other show, where plotlines take on the scope of military incursions. I know from reading your comments that a lot of you feel cheated by Fear the Walking Dead, for skimming over the bulk of the tactical response to the outbreak and going straight to life after the tide has already turned.Part of the shows current intimate dynamics stems from the setting; after all, theres only so much space on a boat. But I think audiences are also hoping to have more of a sense of what is going on the federal level. By the time that other show got going, there was no government to speak of, and some of the strongest and most captivating parts of the first season of Fear was seeing a vision of what a government response to an outbreak on this scale would look like.We know that coastal cities have been burned to the ground as part of Operation Cobalt, but we dont know if America is the only country affected by the zombie apocalypse. While our group races south to meet Strands smugglers, it grapples with keeping together while nearing the border, to a new country and maybe a bigger world."}
{"text": "The Obama administration has worked over several years to steer the country away from policies that deny tens of millions of people with criminal records jobs, housing, education, consumer credit, professional licenses and the other tools they need to forge viable, productive lives.The initiative has been driven by the Federal Interagency Reentry Council  a group of more than 20 government agencies  which has focused most closely on eliminating barriers to employment that have become pervasive since employers began using computer-based arrest and conviction records to screen job applicants.Lately, the administration has also recognized that the vocabulary of incarceration  the permanently stigmatizing way we speak about people who have served time  presents a significant barrier to reintegration. Federal officials have set out to change that lexicon, so that people who have committed crimes have a better chance of being seen not as faceless abstractions, but as human beings worthy of a being back in society.Attorney General Loretta Lynch, for example, gave a speech in Mobile, Ala., two weeks ago on re-entry programs in which she avoided objectifying nouns  like felons or ex-convict or ex-offender  that define people by the worst moment of their lives.In one particularly moving passage, she said: I sent a letter to the governor of each state, asking them to allow citizens returning from federal prisons to exchange their federal Bureau of Prisons inmate ID card  and their authenticated release documentation  for a state-issued ID, because in order to truly rejoin society, every individual needs to be the one to tell society who they are. The reference to former inmates as citizens was strikingly humanizing.The Justice Departments Office of Justice Programs, which supports law enforcement and criminal justice efforts across the country, on Wednesday announced that it would no longer use the words felon or convict on its website, in grant solicitations or in speeches, but would instead use person who committed a crime or individual who was incarcerated.Writing in The Washington Post, Karol Mason, the assistant attorney general who leads that office, said the office adopted this change in language to solidify the principles of individual redemption and second chances that our society stands for.This would no doubt have moved Eddie Ellis, a prominent and impassioned criminal justice advocate who was imprisoned for 23 years for a murder he maintained he did not commit.Mr. Ellis, who died in 2014, set off a movement a decade ago with a widely circulated open letter that urged the country to move away from nouns like convict, because such terms erased the humanity of formerly imprisoned people. The worst part of repeatedly hearing your negative definition of me, he wrote, is that I begin to believe it myself, for as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. When others complained that expressions like people who have committed crimes did not roll easily off the tongue, Mr. Ellis made clear that those extra words acknowledged the humanity of people who, having paid their debts, should not have to feel shut out forever."}

Groff gently allows the novels weaknesses to be named and then to slip aside as she identifies the novel as the authors painful but obligatory task so he can go on to fine future efforts.PENELOPE JOHNSONHAYDENVILLE, MASS.*Eat a PeachTo the Editor:And maybe this wild, tender, harrowing figure understood more about the proper way to write a poem than we would like to admit, writes David Orr of Stevie Smith (On Poetry, April 24). The proper way to write a poem? I dunno. Im a poet, not a critic. But it seems to me that writing a poem aint the same as eating a fig.J. R. SOLONCHEBLOOMING GROVE, N.Y.*Existentialists in AmericaTo the Editor:Edward Mendelsons review of At the Existentialist Caf (April 17) allows me to express my great pleasure at the reception for Sarah Bakewells wonderful book.My father, Dagobert D. Runes, who founded Philosophical Library in 1941, was instrumental in, if not the essential force behind, bringing the key texts of French existentialism to the English-speaking world. In September 1946, he and Gaston Gallimard agreed that Philosophical Library would have exclusive English translation rights to Being and Nothingness. The exigencies of the postwar years delayed their signing the final contract until November 1947, and because of the books complexity, as well as, apparently, Sartres involvement, the English-language edition did not appear for a number of years.Philosophical Library also released Simone de Beauvoirs eloquent defense of existentialism against charges of nihilism and amorality, The Ethics of Ambiguity, in addition to several other books by Sartre. Runes also issued two volumes by Sartres contemporary Martin Heidegger: Essays in Metaphysics comprised two late lectures; German Existentialism collected statements with which Heidegger irrefutably indicted himself as a willing supporter of National Socialism.Clearly, the vision of migr publishers like my father, Jacques and Andr Schiffrin, Kurt Enoch and George Weidenfeld is an essential legacy.REGEEN RUNES KIERNAN-NAJARNEW YORKThe writer is publisher of the Philosophical Library.*UnderrepresentedTo the Editor:I heartily agree with Ayana Mathiss response to the question of which subjects are underrepresented in contemporary fiction (Bookends, April 17). She finds contemporary literature over-focused on suffering, with scant attention to joy and enthusiasm. Also overlooked is joys quieter cousin, basic human decency. There are so many lived and imaginary moments when decency and compassion rise out of everyday reactions to a problematic world.This is especially true of contemporary young adult fiction. Just look at the reading lists: stories filled with despair, mental illness and violence. I dont believe that young adults should be shielded from these elements of existence, but why dont we create a more balanced picture? It is as if moral courage, kindness and joy do not really exist, or worse, that they are not really interesting, not the stuff of real life.I recently reread Rebecca Solnits essay 9/11s Living Monuments, based on interviews with survivors. For some reason, it had never struck me before that although thousands of people were caught in crumbling smoke-filled stairwells of the towers, no one stampeded over others. They walked down hundreds of darkened stairs, with immeasurable horror all around, some carrying disabled co-workers on their backs. Why dont we write young adult books about this?It is almost as if we try to keep examples of heroic decency to ourselves. There is every indication that given the challenges of the coming century, we should tell these stories over and over again, to build a narrative that young and old may remember when confronted with difficult choices.ADELE BARUCHGORHAM, ME.The writer is an associate professor at the University of Southern Maine.*To the Editor:Two words: happy endings.People buy romance novels, sci-fi and other genres because they know they will encounter no unhappiness, no depression, no angst, no killings, no family conflict, etc., the way they will in all of modern fiction. They know what to expect from these books, many of which are formulaic, but many display really good writing, too.Its as if there were some rule that literature cannot have happy endings because those other genres do and it would taint a true work of literature to have them. And readers know this.Similarly, writers know that they must include racism and feminism and the evils of capitalism because without them their books would be politically incorrect. And readers know this as well.So readers dont buy too many books they suspect are literature. Have you noticed that?WILLIAM F. WALLACEBRANDON, MISS.*To the Editor:One underrepresented subject in contemporary fiction is assisted suicide. A historical novelist need look no further than Shakespeares Julius Caesar, in which Brutus, unable to take his own life, asks his servant Strato to assist him: Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face/While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? (Act V, Scene 5). Strato obliges. Given what Hilary Mantel did with Thomas Cromwell, one could imagine how she would treat this minor but significant figure by giving him a back story and imagining what might have happened to him after Brutus death. It would be fascinating to read.BERNARD F.

{"text": "This past week, in a move that was long expected, if no less mourned among those who nervously keep record of the disappearing New York of Woody Allen and Nora Ephron, Fairways parent company, Fairway Group Holdings, filed for bankruptcy. This shouldnt necessarily occasion a eulogy; the grocery chain will continue its operations as it restructures and reduces its debt load. At the same time, it is hard to feel optimistic about the future of the endearingly chaotic, unpolished New York retail style that Fairway has embodied.As business reporters have duly noted, Fairways difficulties have stemmed in large part from the greed of private-equity investment, which has fueled an aggressive and miscalculated expansion. Despite its image of urbanity, Fairway now includes among its 15 locations a branch set a few paces from a Sears in a mall in Rockland County. A few years ago, another outpost opened in Chelsea, one block from a Whole Foods that had been in operation for more than a decade. Simultaneously, of course, came the guerrilla incursions from FreshDirect and Blue Apron and the countless other three-steps-to-vegetarian-cassoulet meal-delivery services that the Internet economy has facilitated.Arguably, though, Fairway has also fallen victim to a culture of increasingly tiered consumer experiences, for which it remains almost too quaintly ecumenical. Beginning in the 1990s, with the growth of stores like Target, cultural commentators spoke often of the democratization of design  the phrase was trotted out to the point of linguistic abuse  a reference to the notion that clothes, teapots, place mats and so on, created to the standards of elite tastes, were now available to a mass audience. If you had money and you were hip, you expressed your renegade affluence by positioning a West Elm vase on top of a $20,000 Biedermeier chest. In some sense, however, rising inequality has pushed the trend toward a reversal. In a city where $4 million apartments are so common that they begin to seem modest, shopping down risks an affliction of heightened status anxiety.Recently a friend sent me a photograph of an empty aisle at a Fairway on the Upper East Side, taken on a weekday evening at 5:30, when the store should have been flooded with shoppers waiting in line to buy wild Alaskan salmon on their way home to watch The Night Manager. A large Big Sale sign loomed ominously. I held this image in my mind against the one I have of the Dean & DeLuca on Madison Avenue in the 80s, which I have never seen short of full  full of uniformed private-school children getting cookies in the afternoon, full of grown men and women in Barbour coats and Burberry and Herms nearly at every other time.Both Fairway and Whole Foods have seen sales weaken over the past year, and part of the reason certainly may be that, in this new world order, they no longer register as rarefied, even though they service the kind of customer who could probably tell the difference between butter from Piedmont and butter from somewhere else. Fairway will give you a break on the price of excellent coffee, it will sell you lots of limes for $2, but in many ways it represents an older, bohemian New York, a time when the Upper West Side was at the gravitational center and people eagerly answered their phones during PBS pledge drives.Weve arrived at a point where food is another luxury experience, demanding a luxury context. According to a study published two months ago in the Journal of Food Products Marketing, retail sales of costlier organic foods have been increasing faster than those of any other category, reaching $37 billion in 2015. Fairway sells organic produce, for instance, but not exclusively, or even centrally. (The study, which looked at more than 1,250 food stores in Manhattan, found that 60 percent had what researchers calculated was an Organic Food Products Index of zero. In other words, despite the apparent omnipresence of pesticide-free Lacinato kale, we are really still vastly undersupplied and there really is entrepreneurial opportunity.)Around the country, and perhaps most notably at the new Hudson Yards, the enormous residential and commercial development going up on the Far West Side where Fairway once hoped to take up residence, food halls with lavish restaurants, beer gardens and chic grocers  complexes in the style of Eataly, of which Mario Batali is an owner  are reviving former manufacturing districts in big and small cities. In Austin, Tex., in Baltimore, in Dallas and Denver and Birmingham, Ala., the culinary revolution is entering its next phase, one in which the process of shopping for food will begin to feel more and more like the experience of staying in a boutique hotel. In New York there are also plans for a food hall on Pier 57, which will come with the Anthony Bourdain brand.Architects and urban planners say that, around the world, retail space will eventually be colonized by food vendors, because no matter how many rolls of toilet paper or value packs of LED light bulbs or 10-ply cashmere sweaters we can buy on Amazon, we, as human beings, will always crave the tactile pleasure of buying food when we are in front of it.Fairway catered to that instinct well. What the market like no other underestimated was the growing desire to feel as if you are living in the pages of Elle Decor when you are buying dried fruit."}
{"text": "ZERO KBy Don DeLillo274 pp. Scribner. $27.Something feels not quite right about subjecting Don DeLillo to the ordinary critical apparatus. I dont read a DeLillo novel for its plot, character, setting; for who betrayed whom and how hard life with Mother was; for Phoenix days and Bombay nights; or for how to tune a fiddle. I read a DeLillo novel for its sentences. And sentence by sentence, DeLillo magically slips the knot of criticism and gives his readers what Nabokov maintained was all that mattered in life and art: individual genius. Sentence by sentence, DeLillo seduces. And I dont just mean on the question of thumbs up or down; I mean that his sentences juke and weave around the best defenses, so that not only is the playing field of the past 50 years strewn with conservative critics of all stripes, but text, subtext, ultimate meanings remain elusive and the game, at least in part, now seems original to him.For instance. Charles Maitland, a British security consultant in DeLillos 1982 novel The Names, compares Western expatriates  diplomats, businessmen, risk analysts  to members of the British Empire whose insouciant lives were full of opportunity, adventure, sunsets, dusty death. Even with so dour a conclusion, it all sounds winsome and romantic in Maitlands formulation, which fails to take into account at whose expense opportunity and adventure are made. Later, Maitland complains: They keep changing the names ... Persia for one. We grew up with Persia. What a vast picture that name evoked. A vast carpet of sand. ... I find I take these changes quite personally. ... Every time another peoples republic emerges from the dust, I have the feeling someone has tampered with my childhood. Clueless but effervescent, this is wit and world-weariness as two sides of the Western coin, the sort of thing one might smile at when spoken at a cocktail party. But it masks a deeper intent. DeLillo artfully reveals Maitlands Western view of things while guiding the reader to ask: Whos changing the names, and why? Smile, and the history of colonialism and the civil wars it ignited will be scrubbed out with a quip.Local pleasures make palatable DeLillos deep and disquieting engagement with the world on many levels: social, political, philosophical, linguistic, interpersonal. In book after book, his characters fall through constructed surfaces and constructed selves into deeper, more terrifying but also more numinous realities. They quest for truer or purer or more permanent identities, for the hidden key that will resolve them of their limitations, weaknesses and mortal bearings. More often than not, that quest leads to disillusionment and death. Thus does David Bell, in Americana, hope to discover in the small towns and bit players of this uncontainable country something that will make him one with the pure incandescent image. Thus does Owen Brademas, searching in The Names for the resolution of a fallen world in a language of divine order, find that search travestied by a murderous cult seeking similar ends. And thus does Lee Harvey Oswald, in Libra, hope to be absorbed into History with a single act of violence in order to be absolved of his otherwise small and insignificant self.In Zero K, DeLillos 16th and latest novel, Jeffrey Lockhart arrives in the middle of the desert at a remote compound called the Convergence. Variously described as an endeavor, a faith-based technology and the first split second of the first cosmic year, the Convergence is a cross between a think tank and a state-of-the-art hospice: the Santa Fe Institute meets Sloan Kettering, with a dollop of Heavens Gate, all of it given over to Christo for interior decorating. Whatever it is, the Convergence coolly ignites the imagination. Jeff hopes to get his bearings, at least geographically, when he asks his father, the billionaire Ross Lockhart, where they are. The nearest city of any size is across the border, called Bishkek, Ross answers from deep within blastproof walls. He continues: Once you know the local names and how to spell them, youll feel less detached.We are, in other words, far from the neocolonial world described so tendentiously by Charles Maitland. We are in a vision of the future, a postracial, post-postcolonial world where Westerners like Ross and Jeff are but one contingent of a technocratic cult with a single aim: to rid the world of that absolute, all-defining force, that ultimate despotic colonizer, death. For the Convergence, as it turns out, is a cryonic suspension facility where the dead are frozen in anticipation of that day when resuscitation is medically feasible. Jeff has arrived there to say a temporary goodbye to his stepmother, the archaeologist Artis Martineau, who is dying of several disabling diseases.Ross Lockhart, who made his billions assessing the financial risk of natural disasters, is a true believer in the promise of the Convergence. He pours money and resources into the endeavor, not to mention old-fashioned dogma. The first half of the book is devoted to abolishing any skepticism Jeff (and the reader) might have for the cryogenically inclined. Respect the idea, Ross tells Jeff of the Convergence, after Jeff, intending only a little disrespect, says, People enroll their pets. Yet, despite the proselytizing, Jeff, who spends his downtime wandering past door after door in a series of unending hallways, cant bring himself to understand whats all around him as anything more than it seems: a lark, a punch line, a cruel delusion. Artis would die, he thinks, chemically prompted, in a subzero vault, in a highly precise medical procedure guided by mass delusion, by superstition and arrogance and self-deception. His skepticism extends to the very rooms and doorways of the Convergence, as he becomes convinced theyre decoys, elaborate fictions to some inscrutable end. He knocks on one, and to his surprise, a man answers in turban and tie. Not a lark, after all. I must have the wrong door, Jeff says by way of apology. Theyre all the wrong door, the man replies. A lark, after all.This is fiction in touch with the starker parables, with Kafka and Beckett, with the austerity of bare rooms and declarative, uninflected sentences. I was uncertain as I read these early pages. Had DeLillo created a world of pure abstraction where the reader would be left to float in the zero-gravity chamber of the death fable, everything to think about and nothing to latch on to? But this is only one of several canny feints in the book, which continually shape-shifts and reimagines itself. In the end, it all adds up to one of the most mysterious, emotionally moving and formally rewarding books of DeLillos long career.Slowly, Jeff comes to understand whats intended out there on the outskirts of Bishkek: technological utopia. Cells will be refashioned. Nanobots will restore the body and augment the brain. The old factions born of religion and geopolitics will be permanently mooted in a post-death world. Jeffs incredulity at such things allows DeLillo to render the Convergence at once otherworldly and entirely believable, one more high-flying human scheme revved on false hope and doomed to fail. What put me in mind, in the early going, of brushed-steel surfaces and lonely centrifuges becomes something warmer and more elegiac as Artiss death nears and the enormity of Rosss loss comes into view. Death, even at the Convergence, remains just that, at least for the foreseeable future. And the man does love his wife.At about the same time, the philosophical implications of cryogenic success deepen. The primary architects of the Convergence, a pair of siblings Jeff calls the Stenmark twins, hold a kind of slapstick seminar on their project; it plays like the Marx Brothers doing a TED talk with the mind-body philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. I found myself asking: What would happen if the souls of the cryogenically preserved went to heaven? Would they resurrect as zombies when science restored their bodies? The book inspires a lot of intellectual play as it drifts away from stark Kafka landscape into Borges-inspired mindspace, even flirting with the trippier themes of Philip K. Dick, and elegy starts to compete not with science fiction, exactly, but with fiction about science.Meanwhile, the real world  I mean yours and mine (and Jeffs), the world of headlines and global warming  enters from the wings in the form of disaster footage projected onto white screens in those hallways Jeff roams. There were temples flooded, homes pitching down hillsides, he tells us. I watched as water kept rising in city streets, cars and drivers going under. If literature is Pounds news that stays news, this is news about news that stays news, for in a place like the Convergence where death has been antiquated, newspaper headlines turn into art installations. Soon the book is pulling a good number of levers, both emotional and intellectual, and really humming, so much so that when Ross, perfectly healthy, announces his intention to follow his wife on the first leg of what they hope to be a round-trip journey  Im going with her, he tells his son, in a cold declaration of his suicide  I was wide-eyed, and reading as much for plot as for prose style.DeLillo, the most perceptive (almost occult) chronicler of contemporary life, has not invented the Convergence out of whole cloth: Its DNA comes from an old evangelism dressed in a new rhetoric and streaming out of Silicon Valley. Death makes me very angry, Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, told his biographer, perhaps to explain why he has given nearly half a billion dollars to medical research to halt human aging. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, together with his wife, has given millions of dollars to the research of biological resiliency. Then there is the Breakthrough Prize, founded by Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech luminaries, with an annual pot of $3 million going to researchers who make discoveries that extend human life. And there is Larry Pages founding of Calico (or California Life Company), an anti-aging research center in San Francisco, with a multimillion-dollar investment from Google. The list goes on. We have entered an age of messianism through philanthropy and are only a billionaires whim away from the Convergence and its dreams of a promise more assured than the ineffable hereafters of the worlds organized religions.The full scope of DeLillos vision for Zero K comes into view with the books second half, when the real world, in the form of New York City and the crisis in Ukraine, floods the page. Two years have passed since Artiss death, and Jeff now finds himself involved with a woman named Emma and her politically precocious son, whom she adopted from Ukraine. The strife there, hopeless and cyclical, is soon to rear its terrible head, with consequences for all of them. But before any of this can transpire, we get familiar DeLillo street life, witty repartee in the backs of cabs, rooftop views of the city at dusk. We have our attention focused on those easily overlooked moments of everyday life, like standing shoeless in the airport, and those quotidian details  fresh towels on the racks, nice new bar of soap, clean sheets on the bed  that give texture and pleasure to the day. We visit Emma at the school where she works with developmentally disabled children, admiring her, as Jeff does, for her tenderness with troubled souls. This teeming life, these unexpectedly touching scenes, come to the reader as both refreshing breeze and melancholy plaint, for what is observed here, what is gloried, is also what is inevitably lost with dying. The careful structure of the book wont let us forget that: The Convergence, the dying part, came first. This is elegy as formal design. We carry the Convergence with us through the vibrant city like a memento mori, for toward a convergence we all must go, and with it, every attachment, every lustful look, the whole worldly kit and caboodle.The Convergence, with its promises of everlasting life, is a seductive dream, just as Charles Maitlands assessment of Western entanglement in far-flung lands is seductive. It will be very gentle, Ross says about Artiss death. It will be quick, safe and painless. Death, painless! This is real, one of the Stenmark twins says. Take the existential leap. Rewrite the sad grim grieving playscript of death in the usual manner. When death is indistinguishable from a long nights sleep among excellent accommodations and in the company of loved ones, after which one awakes rejuvenated and augmented by nanobots with spoken Greek and all of Proust, who wouldnt love the turndown service at the Convergence?But the seduction is every bit as illusory as Charles Maitlands. After all, we are as far from a postracial, post-postcolonial world as we are near to arriving at whatever technique or technology is necessary for eternal life. For those inclined to believe that the rationalist mind-set, in league with science and technology, is better poised to bring about results than the old emissaries of heaven, Zero K reminds them that human nature is one of permanent conflict. Eternal life would only become one more instrument of power and source of human sorrow.The good news, modest as it must be, is Zero K. DeLillos novels generally offer consolation simply by enacting so well the mystery and awe of the real world, by probing deeply and mystically into so much, and by offering the pleasures of his unique style. Just as his characters plunge through constructed realities in quest of truer selves, so do we, as DeLillos readers, find in his pages something akin to insight of a gnostic order. DeLillos characters long to penetrate the enigmas and intrigues of his conjured worlds; DeLillos readers devour his sentences, images and narratives for what amounts to something similar: for all that DeLillo  the seeker, the prophet, the mystic, the guide  sees.That consolation is every bit as present in Zero K as it is in the best of DeLillos previous novels, down to the pleasures of the final page. The scene takes place in New York, with Jeff on a crosstown bus. It ends the book powerfully. I finished it stunned and grateful. DeLillo has written a handful of the past half-centurys finest novels. Now, as he approaches 80, he gives us one more, written distinctly for the 21st."}
{"text": "ALTER EGOSHillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Twilight Struggle Over American PowerBy Mark LandlerIllustrated. 406 pp. Random House. $28.Ever since she stepped down as secretary of state in 2013, Hillary Clinton has been positioning herself to the right of Barack Obama on foreign affairs. In her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, Clinton recalled her foreign policy differences with the president, stating that she had opposed demanding an Israeli settlements freeze in 2009 and warned about Russian President Vladimir Putins malign intentions long before anyone else in the administration. Since then she has gone on to compare Putins annexation of Crimea to Hitlers takeover of the Sudetenland in 1938 and to support a no-fly zone in northern Syria. Look, she told a group at the Council on Foreign Relations several days after the terrorist attacks in Paris in late 2015, I have made clear that I have differences, as I think any two people do. But would Clinton actually preside over a more robustly interventionist foreign policy than Obama? Or is she simply adopting hawkish plumage to woo swing voters and to deflect criticism from the right during the general election?In Alter Egos, his lively and informative study of the relationship between Obama and Clinton, Mark Landler, who is a White House correspondent for The New York Times, comes down emphatically on the side of an interventionist Clinton. Landler expertly quarries her recently released emails from her secret web server, and he has conducted numerous interviews with Obama administration officials (though Clinton and Obama both declined to be interviewed for this book). He depicts Obama as an idealist who disdains the idea of American exceptionalism and Clinton as an inveterate liberal interventionist who firmly believes that the mandate of America extends, to borrow the language of George W. Bush, into any dark corner of the world. Nonetheless, he does not demonstrate that there has ever been a profound clash of foreign policy visions between them.There can be no doubting that tensions existed between the Obama and Clinton camps after the brutal 2008 primary campaign, when Clinton depicted Obama as nave about national security. The Obama loyalist Tommy Vietor, who became a spokesman for the National Security Council, told Landler: The people who went through that campaign manufactured a pretty visceral hatred for each other. You magnify differences and internalize grievances in a way that is ridiculous. Clinton immediately surrounded herself with loyalists at the State Department (though her attempt to install the controversial longtime Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal on the policy planning staff was swiftly batted down by the White House), and she had difficulties penetrating the Obama inner circle. Landler reports that she emailed two aides on June 8, 2009, saying: I heard on the radio that there is a cabinet mtg this a.m. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending? In the early days of the administration, Landler writes, White House officials on the secretarys plane were sometimes viewed as spies.The angriest Obama became with Clinton, Landler says, concerned the Arab Spring and the uprising in Egypts Tahrir Square. Obama pushed for the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, while Clinton was more cautious about parting with a longtime ally and friend of the United States. But Landler also shows that after Islamic radicals attacked and murdered American diplomats in Benghazi, Obama, who had been urged to intervene in Libya by Clinton, drew closer to her personally. For Obama, Landler says, Libya was less a loss of innocence than a confirmation of what he had always believed: that American interventions, more often than not, end in ashes.Landler also shows that Obama and Clinton rapidly altered their stances in responding to unpredictable developments: From Egypt and Bahrain to Yemen and Libya, the president and his secretary of state struggled to reconcile values with interests, democratic hopes with geopolitical realities  often wrapping themselves around the axle in the process. Their struggle culminated in the horrors of Syria, where the United States ended up a bystander to the deadliest war of the 21st century.Unfortunately, Landler is not content with ably tracing these events. In his view, Obama and Clinton are more than just two of the most riveting political figures of our time. They are protagonists in a great debate over American power  one that will decide not only who sits in the Oval Office but the direction she or he will take a nation that faces a new twilight struggle against the forces of disorder. This is unpersuasive. Any disputes between Obama and Clinton over dealing with issues like Iran, Syria or China are about tactics, not substance. At bottom they are both liberal internationalists. Landler himself notes that in warning about the Islamic State, as was often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasnt calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Whats more, any conflicts between them pale into insignificance next to the battle over foreign policy in the Republican Party, which is pitting crusading neoconservatives against outright isolationists.To bolster his case, however, Landler puts Clinton and Obama on the foreign policy couch. For him geography is destiny. He says: Obama and Clinton were divided by geography. She was raised in the middle of the country, in a reliably middle-class suburb of Chicago. Clinton had once told an interviewer that my political beliefs are rooted in the conservatism that I was raised with, and Landler writes: That was especially true of her foreign policy instincts. By contrast, Landler says, Obamas heritage left him suspicious of America: Clinton viewed her country from the inside out; Obama from the outside in.Landler says that Obama became skeptical about American intentions during his childhood years in Indonesia and that his Kenyan roots added another layer to this carapace of suspicion. Already as a freshman at Occidental College, Landler writes, Obama was focused on the limits of American power, observing in a political science paper, the U.S. today has limited influence in the Middle East, and must be viewed as a participant, rather than a controller of the world system. But was it necessary to have lived in Indonesia and have a Kenyan father to arrive at these sensible views? A number of American presidents, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, who grew up in Kansas, were apprehensive about becoming entangled in the Middle East.Landler concludes that Obama and Clinton are very different people with very different instincts about how to wield American power  like Truman and Acheson, the plain-spoken Missouri haberdasher and the aristocratic Connecticut Yankee, who together embodied the idealism and realism of America in the 20th century. But this comparison is dubious. There were no great frictions between Truman and Acheson. Both tried to work with Stalins Soviet Union as late as 1946 before adopting a pragmatic containment policy toward it. Given Clintons own pragmatism, it would be surprising if once in office she tried to embark on a crusade for a new dawn of justice to replace the twilight struggle identified by Landler. Despite Landlers contention that Clinton and Obama exemplify a grand debate, his book inadvertently suggests that the surprising thing isnt that they had occasional disputes. Its that they worked together as well as they did."}
{"text": "WOLF HOLLOWBy Lauren Wolk291 pp. Dutton. $16.99. (Middle grade; ages 8 to 12)Hard truths abound in Wolf Hollow, Lauren Wolks haunting coming-of-age novel, her first book for young readers. The hardest of all is this: Doing right can go very wrong.The year I turned 12, I learned how to lie, Annabelle, the main character, tells us as the story opens. That year is 1943. World War II is raging, and families in Annabelles rural Pennsylvania community have lost sons, but the conflict is a distant one. Annabelles life, bounded by her familys farm and a one-room schoolhouse, is sheltered and safe. Her biggest worries are her annoying little brothers and the unruly older boys at school. Shes never had cause to lie.Until the day Betty Glengarry arrives. A city girl, Betty has been sent to live with her grandparents because shes incorrigible. Her mother cant handle her; her fathers gone. Bettys a bully  and much worse, it turns out, than incorrigible.I didnt know a word that described Betty properly, Annabelle says, or what to call the thing that set her apart from the other children in that school. Betty is a dark-hearted girl, one without morals or remorse, who beats Annabelle with a stick and breaks a birds neck.Annabelle is afraid of her, but shes also at an age where children are eager to prove their mettle, and decides to handle the threat herself. Betty was mine to fear, and I decided that she was mine to disarm. If I could. On my own. She cant, though, and when Bettys cruelty escalates  with devastating consequences  Annabelle confides in her parents. When they confront Betty and her grandparents, the wily girl lies her way out of trouble and directs suspicion toward Toby  a reclusive, shellshocked veteran.Bettys determination to frame an innocent thrusts Annabelle into a predicament far more difficult than deciding whether or not to tattle on a bully. With a childs single-mindedness, she decides that the right thing to do is to protect Toby  even if pulling that off requires a few wrongs. That lies sometimes succeed while truth fails is only one of the tough complexities Annabelle must face. Early in the book, she recalls asking her grandfather how Wolf Hollow got its name. Long ago, he explains, the people who lived here dug pits to trap wolves. They shot the wolves that were getting too brave and too many, and turned their ears in for a bounty.Thinking of the wolves in the pits saddens Annabelle, but her grandfather, a serious man who always told me the truth, which I didnt always want, points out that she didnt mourn the snake he killed last spring. She replies that copperheads are poisonous, and thats different. Not to the snake, it isnt, her grandfather says. Or to the God who made it.This god  the god of wolves, snakes and Betty Glengarry  is an ancient, feral deity, one unconcerned with human constructs of right and wrong, and Annabelle soon realizes that pitfalls dark and deep lie hidden on the path to adulthood, some of them large enough to swallow us whole.Wolf Hollow is beautifully written, with spare, simple language perfectly suited to its subject and setting. Annabelle narrates in the past tense, and Wolk uses this device to great effect, masterfully balancing a mood of aching regret with an electric sense of ominousness. Painting rural life with an even hand, she shows its beauty and its hardship, the strong ties that bind people who live in the country and the intolerance that sometimes finds root there.The books narrative builds suspensefully toward an ending thats wrenching and true, and in its final pages, Annabelle learns to abide by lifes complexities. She thinks of Wolf Hollow as a dark place, no matter how bright its canopy, no matter how pretty the flowers that grew in its capricious light, but also the place where I learned to tell the truth in that year before I turned 12: about things from which refuge was impossible. Wrong, even. No matter how tempting. With a precociously perceptive girl as a main character; a damaged, misunderstood recluse; and themes of prejudice and bigotry, comparisons to Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird will abound. But Wolk gives us her own story  one full of grace and stark, brutal beauty."}
{"text": "GRITThe Power of Passion and PerseveranceBy Angela DuckworthIllustrated. 333 pp. Scribner. $28.Grit: The word has mouth feel. It sounds like something John Wayne would chaw on. Who wouldnt want grit? Wusses. Forget em.Angela Duckworth, the psychologist who has made grit the reigning buzzword in education-policy circles, would surely recoil at any association between it and Waynes outmoded machismo. Duckworth is a scholar you have to take seriously. She has been featured in two best-selling books (How Children Succeed, by Paul Tough, and The Power of Habit, by Charles Duhigg), consulted by the White House and awarded the MacArthur genius fellowship for her work on this obviously desirable trait. At the University of Pennsylvanias Duckworth Lab, grit is gender-neutral. Its self-control and stick-to-it-iveness. The two big ideas about grit that have made Duckworth famous are first, that it predicts success more reliably than talent or I.Q.; and second, that anyone, man or woman, adult or child, can learn to be gritty.Nonetheless, the word has a cowboy kick, and thats not necessarily a bad thing. It harks back to Americas pioneering days. It took grit to light out for the territory, as Huck Finn might have said. The notion that talent is born, not made, is the modern-day version of the caste system those Americans were fleeing. The cult of genius reinforces passivity and dampens ambition. If we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking, Nietzsche wrote in a passage quoted by Duckworth in her new book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.Grit, on the other hand, is egalitarian, or at least a less class-based indicator of future accomplishment than aptitude. Measurable intelligence owes something to genetic endowment but also depends heavily on environmental inputs, such as the number of words spoken to a child by her caregivers. The development of grit does not rely quite so much on culturally specific prompts. Moreover, grit appears to be a better engine of social mobility.Giving character training to the underprivileged will not level Americas increasingly Dickensian inequalities, of course, but Duckworths ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the better. Duckworth has worked closely with influential figures in the education-reform movement, like the founders of the KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) charter school network, which now has 183 schools in 20 states. She helped them devise the tough-love or no excuses pedagogical approach increasingly common among charter schools, which holds students to high standards and employs stern disciplinary methods meant to cultivate good habits. Thanks to her, social and emotional education appears on public school lesson plans throughout the country. Theres even a movement to test schools on how well they teach these noncognitive skills, as theyre called, although it must be said that Duckworth strongly opposes this. She argues that any test of character worth giving is too subjective to standardize, and too easy to game.In this book, Duckworth, whose TED talk has been viewed more than eight million times, brings her lessons to the reading public. My guess is youll find Grit in the business section of your local bookstore. As marketing strategies go, its not a bad one, although the conventions of the self-help genre do require Duckworth to boil down her provocative and original hypotheses to some rather trite-sounding formulas.If this book were a Power Point presentation, as it surely has been, the best slide would be the two equations that offer a simple proof for why grit trumps talent: Talent  effort = skill. Skill  effort = achievement. In other words, Effort counts twice. My grandfather, an immigrant, knew this. He would have called grit Sitzfleisch. (Malcolm Gladwell, in his best-selling Outliers, called it the 10,000-hour rule.) Moreover, you dont just need Sitzfleisch. You need focused Sitzfleisch. Thirteen-year-old Kerry Close logged more than 3,000 hours of practice to become the National Spelling Bee champion, but that wasnt the reason she won. Closes competitive edge came from her fearless approach to practicing. At her tender age, she had the guts to identify and fix her mistakes, over and over again.Im a person who takes to her bed when forced to confront her own failures, so I was daunted by Close and the other indefatigable people  grit paragons  profiled by Duckworth: West Point cadets who endure a grueling rite of initiation; a woman who overcame cerebral palsy to become one of the most successful comics in Britain. I got the lowest possible score on Duckworths Grit Scale, and dropped right onto my fainting couch. But there is hope for me yet. Duckworth offers what amounts to a four-step program, the last step of which is to overcome pessimism by cultivating what her fellow psychologist Carol Dweck calls a growth mind-set. I just have to complete Steps 1 through 3 first: (1) identify a burning interest; (2)practice it a lot; and (3) develop a sense of higher purpose, by which Duckworth means I must believe that my passion will improve the world.Step 3 strikes me as the least plausible of the four, even though Duckworth offers evidence that people who think their pursuits contribute to the well-being of others are more likely to meet their top-level goals. Success is heartwarming, but does not always make the world a better place. One paragon of purpose-driven grit is Kat Cole, the child of a cash-strapped single mother, who rose from a waitressing gig at Hooters to become president of the Cinnabon bakery chain. Coles Horatio Algeresque tale may inspire readers, but her philosophy of giving back will not awaken anybodys altruistic instincts. If I could help companies, I could help brands, she asserts. If I could help brands, I could help communities and countries. This is corporate sloganeering, not an ethical stance. At 880 calories and 36 grams of fat apiece, Cinnabon buns help no one.The feebleness of this example exposes a flaw in this book and, to a lesser degree, in Duckworths doctrine: A focus on grit decouples character education from moral development. Duckworth never questions the values of a society geared toward winning, nor does she address the systemic barriers to success. She is aware of the problem, and includes the necessary to-be-sure paragraph. Opportunities  for example, having a great coach or teacher  matter tremendously, she writes. My theory doesnt address these outside forces, nor does it include luck. Its about the psychology of achievement, but because psychology isnt all that matters, its incomplete. She concludes with a section praising the writer and MacArthur fellow TaNehisi Coates for being especially gritty, though I wonder how Coates, who has written extensively about structural racism in America, might feel about being used to exemplify her up-by-the-bootstraps ethos.You cant blame Duckworth for how people apply her ideas, but shes not shy about reducing them to nostrums that may trickle down in problematic ways. On the one hand, some of the no excuses charter schools that her research helped to shape have raised math and literacy scores among minority and poor students. On the other hand, a growing number of scholars as well as former teachers at those schools report that some of the schools, at least, feel more like prisons than houses of learning. Schools that prize self-regulation over self-expression may lift a number of children out of poverty, but may also train them to act constrained and overly deferential  worker-learners, as the ethnographer Joanne W. Golann calls them. Meanwhile, schools for more affluent children encourage intellectual curiosity, independent reasoning and creativity. Ask yourself which institutions are more likely to turn out leaders. Perhaps an approach to character training thats less hard-edge  dare I say, less John Wayne-ish?  and more willing to cast a critical eye on the peculiarly American cult of individual ascendancy could instill grit while challenging social inequality, rather than inadvertently reproducing it."}
{"text": "To my 4-year-old, Im either the sun  the central, life-sustaining force around which his whole existence orbits  or he himself is the sun and his father and I are mere rocks circling him ceaselessly. Whats a poor grown-up to do? Forget about the grown-ups! Hows a mere kid supposed to understand how he and his parents fit together? Thankfully, four new picture books invite adults and children alike to reframe, celebrate and sometimes giggle at this most complex of human relationships.The French author-illustrator Soledad Bravis Mommy, Pick Me Up is made for the child who repeats Mommy, Mommy, Mommy like a paparazzo vying for a starlets attention. Most of the book follows a simple and pleasing pattern: Each page features the same boy addressing his mother. He begins, Mommy?! Theres no more cereal. A few pages later he asks, Mommy? What are you doing? Minimalist drawings of the little boy, set against one brightly colored background, and another, and another, reflect the narratives repetition. The boys words are hand-drawn inside comic-book-style dialogue bubbles, and Bravi cleverly changes the lettering to reflect tone; the boy speaks in cursive when he is sweet and beseeching, and in all capital letters when he is yelling. Children will laugh to see him naked, surrounded by discarded clothes (MOMMY! I CANT FIND MY PAJAMAS!), and any exhausted parent will identify with the image of the mother covered by her childs cartoon dialogue bubble: She has been obliterated by his needs  literally.Finally, the boy calls for his dad, and like a well-crafted joke, the book veers from its pattern at just the right moment. For the first time, we hear a parent respond. We hold our breath to see what will happen next. To tell you would spoil this books delightful commentary on the often absurd imbalance of prestige between mothers and fathers.The humor in Mommy, Pick Me Up allows children to laugh at their own behavior  to step back and acknowledge it. The comedic approach of My Dad at the Zoo, by Coralie Saudo, illustrated by Kris Di Giacomo, also invites self-reflection. This time, its with a role-reversal premise. Dont let his fedora and tie fool you; the father in My Dad at the Zoo is a kid. Like a kid, he is by turns zany and frustrating, and his son is the put-upon guardian. Every Sunday morning Dad wakes the household by yelling that he wants to go to the zoo. Once there he proceeds to run away, scream for ice cream, hand his hat (yet again) to the elephants and finagle his way into the souvenir shop.Exclamation points abound, and occasionally the prose is musical, as when Dad is grimacing at the gorillas, flirting with the flamingos, ... terrorizing the turtles.The role-reversal motif feels a bit static, especially in comparison to Saudo and Di Giacomos similarly themed My Dad Is Big and Strong, BUT ... But the real thrill of this book lies in the illustrations. The background color palette is mostly a muted set of beiges, browns and light blues, and Dad is pencil-drawn as a bulky goof with a thick waist and feet as tiny as hooves. The other zoogoers are colorless and appalled at him. Meanwhile, the pink flamingos click cameras, and a lion, utterly sanguine in the face of such chaos, sips from his fountain drink. The whimsy has an edge that gives me pause. But why am I so humorless, when the fathers ridiculous behavior inspired in my child unbridled expressions of delight? I can only hope the book causes my son to wonder why he himself can be such a pain.Not all picture books need jokes to win over a child. Anthropomorphized animals work just as well, as does sincerity. Those are the gifts of the Mexican author-illustrator Renata Galindos American debut, My New Mom and Me, a tenderhearted and honest depiction of adoption from a childs perspective. In Galindos world, the mother is a striped orange-red cat and the child is a yellow dog. The text begins: When I first came to live with my new mom, I was nervous. This would be my new home. We learn that the child has never had my own room before, hinting deftly at a past that remains off the page but not out of mind. The narrator worries she doesnt look like her new parent, but when she tries to paint stripes on herself, her mom washes her off: She likes that we are different. Because these are animals and not humans, their difference is an objective, depoliticized fact, one that young readers will be able to understand right away. It also sweetens the more serious parts of the story, as when the dog admits, Sometimes I feel really sad, and we see her crying in her room with her new mom peeking in, the light from the hallway represented as a circle of white over the otherwise gray bed.Although this is a simple story, with appropriately pared-down illustrations, it nevertheless takes on big issues like trauma, loss and the struggles of transitions and adaptation in a way that feels broad and welcoming. At one point the narrator tells us, Mom is learning how to be my mom, and I am learning how to be Moms kid. My son and I discussed how its the same for us, even though weve known each other since he was born. We are always teaching each other.While My New Mom and Me describes a very particular relationship in a way that any family can relate to, Tell Me a Tattoo Story, by Alison McGhee and illustrated by Eliza Wheeler, seems, at first glance, written specifically for the hipster parent who longs to see himself reflected in literature, tat sleeves and all. Here, tattoos are emblems of personal history, as a father describes to his son what inspired each one. The first is from his favorite childhood book, the next  the phrase Be Kind  was something his own dad said to him. Wheelers lush, detailed images beautifully dramatize each moment from the fathers past, and we move seamlessly between the present to these memories.We dont hear the son directly, however, only the fathers answers, and the slightly awkward conceit draws attention to itself each time Dad repeats his kids questions back to him. I also found myself struck by how traditional the book was, despite its inked protagonist. Dad coyly says of one tattoo, This one reminds me of the day I met a pretty girl, meaning, of course, the boys mother, who has been smiling nearby in the present scenes. Pretty girl sounds like something out of a Leave It to Beaver episode; might he have called her what she is (and was): a woman? But maybe thats the point. Even these cool families incubate their own brand of corny, throwback love. Maybe we all do. Parenting, and being parented, would probably be too hard without it."}
{"text": "On the outside, the house at 43 Suffolk Street in Sag Harbor, N.Y., was designed to blend in with nearby homes that were built in the 18th century. Inside, it is very much a 21st-century home. Its radiant heated bathroom floors, gas fireplaces and security system can be controlled with an iPhone, and a hydraulic lift transports a vehicle down to the homes lower level, where, like a treasured sculpture, the car sits in a glass-enclosed showcase visible from a spacious lounge and a wine room.The owners have listed the house for sale at $12 million.We were aiming at understated luxury, said John McLaughlin, who owns the just-completed home with his wife, Joanne McLaughlin. Mr. McLaughlin, 60, is a retired executive vice president of Monster Worldwide, the parent company of the jobs site Monster.com, and his wife, 52, is a potter. They live on the same street as their newly built house, in a home dating to 1765.The McLaughlins had initially planned to move into the new house, which has five bedrooms and five and a half baths over more than 7,000 square feet. It sits on a quiet street near the quaint shops of this historic East End village, once a whaling port. I love old architecture, but I also like a house that breathes, Mr. McLaughlin said.But the couple never moved in, because circumstances changed in the two years since they purchased, for less than $2 million, the nearly half-acre property, which had a 1960s ranch-style house on it that they tore down. Both their children, Ben, 22, and Kylie, 19, went off to colleges in California  which the parents had not anticipated  and the house became too big for just the two of us, Ms. McLaughlin said. Also, she said, the children wanted us to stay in the family home, even though they would only be visiting.The couple had already filled the new house with furniture and artwork from previous places they had lived, in Manhattan and in Auckland, New Zealand, during Mr. McLaughlins career at a head-hunting firm and then at Monster, where at one point he oversaw the Asia-Pacific region. The house is being sold unfurnished, though some furnishings may be negotiable.Getting permission to build the house required six visits to the villages Board of Historic Preservation and Architectural Review, Mr. McLaughlin said. Each time, he and his architect, Kirby Grimes, presented a slightly different plan. Mr. McLaughlin said he originally wanted to pattern the house after the nearby Custom House, an 18th-century building that is now a museum. Board members thought that proposal too large, and later made other suggestions. Although the process was painful and very costly, the outcome was a better house, he said.Lighting, staircase railings and other details are all custom made. Dereyk Patterson, a woodworker from East Hampton, N.Y., created cabinets and the beams that wrap around a two-story stone fireplace. Window moldings echo the Egyptian Revival design of the local Old Whalers Church. The white oak floors were finished with a traditional soap and lye method, and walls are covered with three coats of plaster and two coats of wax. The backyard has a heated pool.Were setting the bar for luxury in Sag Harbor, said Mark J. Baron of Brown Harris Stevens of the Hamptons, who is the lead broker for the property.Now that the owners have decided to sell, they are only a bit sad, Ms. McLaughlin said. We hope someone will enjoy it as much as we would have."}
{"text": "If you want to understand the Bywater, look no further than its frozen-daiquiri machine. Yes, its pumping out flamingo-pink slushies, but they contain two kinds of premium rum and get their color from pomegranate juice. Its a well-thought out, well-balanced cocktail that just happens to be in slushy form, said David Kinch, the restaurants owner. That kind of sums up what were trying to do.Frozen daiquiris are perhaps the last thing youd expect to see on a menu from Mr. Kinch, the pioneering California chef who has racked up three Michelin stars for his innovative cooking at Manresa, the restaurant he opened in Los Gatos in 2002. But for his second restaurant (a few blocks from his first) the chef wanted a casual place that would channel the cuisine and spirit of New Orleans, the city where he grew up and got his first job in a restaurant kitchen, as a 16-year-old line cook at Commanders Palace. At Manresa, we spend a lot of time creating an experience that becomes a giant memory, Mr. Kinch said. With the Bywater, the whole point was creating a neighborhood joint.The neighborhood has responded enthusiastically: For the first couple of months after the Bywater opened in January, a line snaked down the block from its purple, green and yellow front doors. Inside the snug space, servers in Crescent City-themed T-shirts (Mr. Kinchs favorite reads New Orleans Is for Livers) dish out regional specialties like rich, meaty gumbo ya-ya, satisfyingly crunchy oyster poboys, fried green tomatoes and pillowy beignets.In devising their menu, Mr. Kinch and the Bywaters chef, David Morgan, couldnt resist adding personal spins to some of the classics. Theres a bo boy, a porky riff on bo ssam, and oysters Rock-a-Fella, which forsakes oysters Rockefellers typical all-spinach base for a half-spinach, half-watercress version that harks back to the original recipe.Pretty much everything about the restaurant is a testament to Mr. Kinchs love of New Orleans: The walls are decorated with photos and paintings from his collection, while the music  a mix of New Orleans soul funk and traditional jazz, retro R&B, brass band and bebop  is pulled from the soundtrack of his youth. The restaurant is, in short, a place where the chef can have fun.Im not saying we dont pay attention to detail, but theres a certain amount of freedom, Mr. Kinch said. Its really casual, there are no reservations and the music is a little bit loud."}
{"text": "Finally, we were in Provence, and the drive from Gordes to Carpentras had it all: roadside vineyards, cone-shaped Bories (ancient stone dwellings), the Abbey Snanque and, at the foot of the mountain, an artisanal boulangerie proffering baguettes and croissants.We were there for a soccer camp. Our three sons were all suited up.When our twins were 7, and our youngest 5, they learned geography by identifying countries with their flags during the 2010 World Cup; now at 13 and 11, they play for the Downtown United Soccer Club in New York.Planning a summer trip from Paris to Rome, my husband and I figured we should combine our passion for historic sites with their passion for soccer. But because soccer season in France and Italy ends in May, we were at a loss  until a teammate mentioned a camp in Italy sponsored by Juventus, the Turinese powerhouse. Intrigued, we found our way to the website of Soccer Camps International. Youth soccer camp, the site made clear, is a big deal: It involves professional coaching, stadium visits, language immersion and the like.We arranged to visit three camps in France and Italy where our sons could take part and test them out while we spoke with coaches and participating families. Are European soccer camps welcoming and challenging for young American players? Or are they pricey forms of branded tourism? Those were our central questions, and with the  2016 UEFA European Championship  taking place this summer in France from June 10 to July 10, many soccer-mad families are asking them, too.Carpentras, FranceStages Bosquier feels like a soccer school, with lectures and video demonstrations in the hours between morning drills and afternoon matches. Run by Bernard Bosquier, a star of Frances World Cup squad in 1966, Stages Bosquier immerses players ages 7 to 17 in high-level soccer and in the French language. Most players we met were from France, but others came from England, Canada, Italy and the United States.For 35 years, Stages Bosquier has been held in the south of France, most recently at a sports complex in Carpentras, with a dormitory, snack bar, and lobby kitted out with foosball tables, and walls papered with clippings about former campers like Samir Nasri (who now plays with Manchester City). This summer the camp will move to a modern complex in Cavaillon.After breakfast, campers meet outside for Ping-Pong and ptanque (a game like horseshoes, but with balls) before breaking into groups (grands, moyens, petits) on fields nearby. As the boys changed into matching jerseys, they hung their European club replica jerseys on hangers on the wire fence (theyd been instructed to care for their uniforms as well as themselves). Our boys swapped their favorite team jerseys for camp colors and were gone.Training begins amid the clicking of cicadas: dribbling, long passing, passing with the outside of the foot, and shooting, and one called ltoile  keep-away along points of an imagined star. Coaches are Mr. Bosquiers friends and former teammates: 60-ish men with the taut legs of teenagers. Training is conducted in French, but the language of soccer prevails. Football is the same as life, said Mr. Bosquier, You need to work out, you need to work together, you need to respect one another.Following an hour of games with seven players on a side, campers walked to a park for football de plage: beach soccer. After showers, lunch and rest, they attended the midday lecture  Le Football Est Fait de Mouvement the day we visited  and then went to late-afternoon matches.Mr. Bosquiers daughter, Valerie, an interior designer during the year, is the camps mother figure, making sure the campers have water and sunblock, taking photos for their parents. During the midday pause, she sent us into town for lunch and a swim, and we returned refreshed to watch the matches  stages in a tournament, which concludes on the last day of camp, with parents present.In the evening our sons rejoined us, and we pointed our rented Citron through the limestone passageways of Gordes, one of the loveliest villages in France. At LArtgal, a small restaurant with tables beneath the floodlights of the Chteau de Gordes, we ate salmon, duck, fresh vegetables and sorbet. For a moment, we all forgot there was soccer the next morning.Information: bosquier.com. Options include 460 euros (about $520) for one week with room and board. One week is reserved for girls ages 14 to 17.Lignano Sabbiadoro, ItalyFifty-six miles from Venice, Lignano Sabbiadoro is a resort town in Friuli, poking out into the warm bath of the Adriatic Sea. There, the spartan Getur Sports Village amid pine trees is the site of the AC Milan Junior Camp. The song playing in the lobby, oddly, was Let It Snow.As our sons joined the arriving campers, they received a club kit and soon blended into the red, white and black of AC Milan.The camp directors, Pietro and Michele Marchioni (father and son), have turned their lifelong passion for AC Milan into a soccer League of Nations. The Marchionis run camps under license to their company, Sportaventi, on the Asiago mountain plateau; at Cortina dAmpezzo in the Dolomites; in Jesolo Lido, a ferry ride from Venice; at Lignano Sabbiadore, where we visited, and one near Naples for American military families  so that they can interact with Italians off the Navy base there, Michele Marchioni said.Soccer is the national disease, he told us, and explained how he came to spread it. Studying economics at Oxford, I realized I could bring the world here, and create a multicultural society like the one I knew at Oxford. At the Lignano camp, half of the 92 campers were Italian; the coaches speak mainly in Italian, but English and Russian are spoken, too. There were players from Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Lebanon. A dozen players came from Japan with a chaperone while their parents visited Venice.At a buffet-style breakfast our sons got to know two players from Taiwan, as well as another player from New York. Then all the campers strode in two lines to the soccer fields, all singing the AC Milan anthem with kids and coaches waving flags on long poles front and rear.Morning training moved players through various activities, including dribbling, passing and five-passes. The drills (our sons said) were a notch less intense than at Bosquier, but the coaching was lively and precise with one coach for every 12 players. Goalkeepers are trained separately. One coach showed a keeper how to position his body by making a cross  torso up and down, arms outstretched.As at Bosquier, afternoons are devoted to matches, but at Lignano, midday is time for fun. One group goes to the waterslides, another to the beach.The night we were there, campers went to an amusement park, and the Marchionis took us to the restaurant Brigantino for supper with Pierino Prati. Mr. Prati (Pierino the Pest) starred for Italy in the 1970 World Cup. He ensured the camp is training players the AC Milan way  playing with the ball as a team, stressing style rather than physicality. We look at the quality of their feet, but also their minds, Mr. Prati said. Are they looking at their teammates? Do they have a global vision of the game?Mr. Marchioni added: Soccer is like life, soccer is life. So we take a holistic approach: physical, mental and emotional, to help bring the talent out from the inside.

At a landscaped estate, campers were coming over the crest of a hill, PSG duffel bags slung over their arms. The turf fields were refreshingly free of sports-gear signage. Here the brands were PSGs players. A camp day named for the striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was devoted to shooting; Lucas Mouras day was focused on developing players dribbling and creativity with the ball.Paris Saint-Germain has opened camps in New York, Brazil, Montreal, Qatar and India, as well as outside Paris. The clubs Academy head coach, Ben Houri, strolling the sidelines, explained the PSG philosophy. Its easier to create an athlete than a footballer, and its easier to teach passing than dribbling, but dribbling is where creativity happens, and good footballers are naturally relaxed with the ball. Players at the camp learn this through quickness exercises (races) and agility exercises (right foot in the red hoop, left in the yellow one).For one week they live like PSG youth players, said Julien Bacinello, the project manager. The camp is run by Urban Football, which promotes soccer for adults in French cities, and the family feeling we had seen at Bosquier and Lignano was less obvious. The midday pause was more or less unstructured, with players working foosball tables and PlayStations under the light supervision of young counselors.A Wednesday outing to Paris, then, was well-timed. Urban Football is converting tennis clubs to 5 on 5 soccer pitches, and the branch in La Dfense offered a glimpse of soccers future: office workers meeting during the lunch hour for a match and some team building.After two hours of training the campers went by bus across Paris for a tour of the Stade de France, which they were reminded was the site of Pariss home victory in the 1998 World Cup final. It turned out to be a history lesson in advance: Three months later, explosions were heard there during the terrorist attacks on Paris.Information:  soccercampsinternational.com/france-soccer-camps. For boys ages 8 to 17. Options include $1,395 for one week with room and board.In New York the next week, our sons were back with their own club, Downtown United. From the sidelines, my husband and I assessed the European camps. Are they welcoming to Americans? Yes, if your children are willing to stretch a bit culturally and trust the language of soccer. Are they challenging? Yes, but its important to choose a camp with a skill level that suits the player in your family. Are they an authentic experience, or just pricey branded tourism? Theyre both. European clubs have deep roots, so joining the culture of a renowned club is a form of immersion in its home country.For our boys, the answer to all soccer-camp questions is simple: They want to go back."}
{"text": "Vanessa Bayer of Saturday Night Live doesnt get home until around 5 a.m. following the shows weekly live performance and after-party. A lot of the time Ill go to sleep with all of my makeup on, Ms. Bayer said. The 34-year-old comedian and actress, who played Amy Schumers sidekick in the movie Trainwreck last summer, grew up in Cleveland and discovered the meaning of comic relief while battling leukemia as a teenager. I dont know if it made me funnier, but it was so amazing, how it made everything be O.K., she said. Ms. Bayer lives in a one-bedroom apartment in a West Village high-rise, by herself. But I just realized theres a part of my floor that squeaks, she said, so its kind of like I have a cute pet.SOFA BOUND I try to get up by 3. I put a sweatshirt on over my PJs and I go down my stairs. Its like a loft where I live; my bedroom is upstairs. My TV is in an entertainment center. You have to open the doors for the remote to work, so I open those and then I sit down on my couch. Ill forget my slippers upstairs and Ill be like, Ugh! I have to go upstairs to get them. Its like eight stairs. But stairs are stairs.THAT MAKEUP Ill wash my face because I start to feel like my eyes are stuck together. Its so much makeup from the show. I usually dont shower. Theres just no reason.TOASTED! I order food from my couch and I dont leave my couch again until it comes. Ill order a bagel. Ill get really mad because they will forget to toast it. It didnt happen when I lived further east, near NYU. Those people were really on it. Id say it takes me a good 10 minutes to get over it. Ill have a savory or sesame bagel. Sometimes Ill get a raisin bagel with raisin walnut cream cheese and theyll use a knife they cut an onion bagel with and then theres a whole section of the bagel I cant eat. I usually order coffee with the bagel. My coffee maker isnt the best, so I like ordering it in. Sometimes the coffee will have spilled onto the bagel, and then of course, you know how upsetting that is.UNREALITY TELEVISION Ill sit and Ill watch TV while Im eating my bagel. Its stuff I have DVR-ed. Real Housewives, stuff on Bravo. I also weirdly watch General Hospital. I used to watch it and then I stopped and now Ive started watching it again. They have a lot of supernatural stuff. I truly love it, but the level of believability is very low. Its very refreshing.PRIORITIES I joined Twitter two years ago. I was late to it. So I am still really into it. Ill make a tweet. Wait, is that what you say? Post a tweet? Ill post a tweet and then Ill call my brother and say, Hey, did you see my tweet? I wont talk on the phone too much. Its usually fun to talk to my parents. I mean, its always fun! I dont want to burn my parents. But I dont pick up the phone much on Sundays. I like texting with friends, but I find if I am watching TV, I have to focus on the show.CHECKING THE FRIDGE My fridge is usually pretty empty. If I can get it together to order FreshDirect, I will have some fruit and yogurt in the fridge. But there isnt a ton of stuff you would cook with. I feel like my parents are going to be very proud of me when they read this.NOISES OFF I usually meditate twice a day, Transcendental Meditation. For some reason, I always forget to meditate on Sunday, because its such a weird day, and Ill remember at 5 and meditate for 20 minutes. And its great, because Ill feel like Im getting something done. Even though I am sitting on the couch.DELIVERY At 7 or 8 I decide to order dinner. I try and eat kind of healthy on Sunday nights, to balance out the bagel. Some kind of salad, or sushi sometimes. At dinner, Ill switch to HBO. I can stay up watching TV so late. The problem is I dont get tired early because of staying up so late. I might order a snack, popcorn, at 11. Sometimes Ill order in three times on Sundays. People think New York is crazy and busy, but its actually a great place for lazy people to live. You can order microwaveable popcorn! Ill order, like, those bags of it. But theres a minimum, so then Ill order laundry detergent. I wonder sometimes what the doormen think of me."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  When President Obama first visited Japan in November 2009, he said he hoped someday to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the United States dropped atomic bombs during World War II.With his fourth and likely final visit to Japan as president scheduled this month for a Group of 7 meeting for leaders of industrialized nations, the White House is deciding whether Mr. Obama will follow through. No sitting American president has ever visited the cities, because of concerns that such a trip would suggest that the United States was apologizing for the attacks.The memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are etched in the minds of the world, and I would be honored to have the opportunity to visit those cities at some point during my presidency, Mr. Obama said in 2009.The calculus for a visit is particularly complicated for Mr. Obama. Political opponents have often falsely accused him of undertaking an apology tour of world capitals in his first year in office, so anything that even hints at atonement would feed that criticism.On the other hand, Mr. Obama has made curbing the worlds stockpile of nuclear weapons and lowering the risks of nuclear attack a signature issue of his presidency, an important reason he won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize.The symbol of Hiroshima is the significant and even, in some ways, tragic ability that mankind has to wreak terrible destruction, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a recent briefing.But Mr. Earnest was unequivocal when asked whether the president believes that Japan deserves a formal government apology: No, he does not.The bombings killed more than 200,000 people, most of them civilians, and led to the Japanese surrender.Some historians say the bombings were unnecessary and even criminal, while others argue that they  saved American lives and those of hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians who would have perished in an American invasion. Older Americans tend to view the bombings as necessary, while younger ones see them as far more problematic.There appears to be little official appetite in Japan for an apology.In 2007, Fumio Kyuma, Japans defense minister at the time, referred to the bombings as something that couldnt be helped. A secret 2009 State Department cable released by WikiLeaks in 2011 quoted a top Japanese diplomat as calling a visit to Hiroshima premature and any apology a nonstarter. And Japans own record of delayed apologies for its wartime behavior and atrocities has been criticized.Mr. Obama has sought to make fundamental changes in foreign policy by challenging long-held assumptions about relations with Cuba, Myanmar and Iran, and many observers predict that he will do the same with Japan. He and his closest advisers are often disdainful of what they see as the think-tank consensus in Washington about how the United States should behave on the world stage. In a speech in Prague in 2009, Mr. Obama made clear that he believed the United States had a unique role arising from Hiroshima.Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century, the president said. As the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act.Both Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser to Mr. Obama, and Wendy Sherman, who recently left as the fourth-ranking official in the State Department, said in interviews that Mr. Obama should visit Hiroshima.Mr. Donilon pointed to the North Korean nuclear program, a deep concern in Japan, as one reason for such a visit. I think a visit would serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of nuclear weapons, Mr. Donilon said.Ms. Sherman said Mr. Obamas emphasis on nuclear nonproliferation made a visit to Hiroshima essential.For him to go to Japan and not go to the place where we birthed a nuclear century doesnt make any sense, she said. I think he has to go.But Victor Cha of Georgetown University, an adviser on Asia in the George W. Bush White House, said any suggestion that countries should get rid of all nuclear weapons while North Korea continued to build more made little sense.I think the risks of a visit outweigh the benefits, Mr. Cha said.Last month, Secretary of State John Kerry became the highest-ranking United States official ever to visit Hiroshima, during a diplomatic conclave intended to set the stage for the Group of 7 meeting this month.Everyone should visit Hiroshima, and everyone means everyone, Mr. Kerry said at a news conference. He called the visit stunning and gut-wrenching, and he wrote in a guest book: It is a stark, harsh, compelling reminder not only of our obligation to end the threat of nuclear weapons, but to rededicate all our effort to avoid war itself.Some conservative commentators criticized Mr. Kerry for not telling the Japanese that they deserved to be bombed, something Mr. Obama is also unlikely to do.For decades, American diplomats largely avoided Hiroshima and Nagasaki or any official remembrance of the attacks. That changed in August 2010, when John V. Roos, the American ambassador at the time, attended a commemoration in Hiroshima. His successor, Caroline Kennedy, has also attended.Former President Jimmy Carter toured the Hiroshima memorial in May 1984, three years and four months after he left office, and Representative Nancy Pelosi visited the memorial in 2008 when she was speaker of the House."}

{"text": "THE GREAT AMERICAN WHATEVERBy Tim Federle278 pp. Simon & Schuster. $17.99. (Young adult; ages 14 and up)The hero appears unremarkable: a bespectacled orphan who lives beneath a staircase, maybe, or a farmer unaware hes destined to be a Jedi knight. Or perhaps, as in Tim Federles bighearted young adult debut, hes a skinny, wisecracking almost-17-year-old dropout who lives on Hot Pockets, longs to get naked with another boy, and smells as if he hasnt had a shower in a month-ish.Students of Storytelling 101 know what follows: Our hero is called to adventure. He refuses the call, but ultimately decides to go (because: whatever). He meets a mentor and fights battles with the help of trusty sidekicks. Eventually, he slays a monster and returns home reborn. This, of course, is the heros journey, a plot device employed by many an aspiring screenwriter. For Quinn Roberts, the endearing and self-deprecating protagonist of The Great American Whatever, it isnt mere literary structure. Its his life guide.Federle is the author of two acclaimed middle-grade novels, Better Nate Than Ever and Five, Six, Seven, Nate! While his latest book takes us into darker, more mature territory, it shares similarities with his earlier works: an effortless voice, a Pittsburgh setting and a character whos imperfect and deeply lovable. Quinn has longed to write films since, at 10 years old, he met Ricky Devlin, a handsome 20-something screenwriter who taught Quinn the time-tested secret of the heros journey. Quinn and his older sister, Annabeth, formed Q & A Productions, aspiring to be like the Coen brothers.But the film of Quinns life, a fairly standard coming-of-age L.G.B.T. genre film, turned toward the macabre when Annabeth died after crashing her car while texting Quinn. That was the night, Quinn explains, I gave up on becoming a screenwriter, or an anythingwriter, or an anything. After all, he agonizes, what is a Q without an A?Since Annabeths death, Quinn has seldom left the house. His primary scene partner has been his mother, adrift in her own grief. Enter Geoff  a friendly sidekick who names his own farts and wears neon yellow flip-flops. Geoff is determined to get Quinn out of the house. Naturally, he refuses the call, but by nights end, they are at a party where Quinn meets Amir, a dashing college student.Until now, Quinns romantic life didnt even rate as PG-13. Geoff and his sister are determined to change that, arranging dates, delivering messages and gifts. While this isnt the utopia of David Levithans Boy Meets Boy  homophobia lurks in the form of leering bro-types  its refreshing to read a story in which coming out to ones friends is a nonissue.Although hes abandoned his craft, Quinn is still a screenwriter at heart. He narrates his own life with an inner monologue thats both frenetic and comical. The book unfolds with a cinematic feel, too. There are roller coaster dates, passionate kisses beneath a riot of fireworks, intriguing promises of lost virginity, the return of the near-mythic Ricky Devlin, betrayals and secrets revealed. Yet as the boundary between script and reality grows increasingly blurry, none of these moments play out as Quinn would write them.Geoff, it turns out, isnt merely a fashion-backward sidekick; hes been starring in a secret story of his own. Annabeth, too, appears to have had her own tale  one in which Quinns role might veer toward the villainous. Its in this revelation  not only has Quinn lost Annabeth forever, he also failed to know her while she was here  that the novel is most tender and poignant. In the end, theres no monster to be slain  only a boy alone with excruciating grief.Ricky Devlin once advised Quinn to write dialogue fast, fast, fast, because people dont think before they talk. I suspect Federle does this himself, as the book has a rare vitality. On a few occasions, though, information seems haphazardly revealed. Annabeth and Quinns final fight  rooted in Annabeths decision to prioritize college applications over Quinns unfinished film  would have more urgency if the reader already knew nobody in their family had finished college. Also, Quinns nonstop commentary sometimes distracts from otherwise powerful moments.These are small quibbles, though, and the rewards for setting them aside are great. Like the mythic heroes of Quinns screenwriting guide, Federle has triumphed. Hes written a moving tale about grief thats also laugh-out-loud funny."}
{"text": "It was a blustery spring Saturday in Brooklyn Heights, and the customers shopping at Sahadis Importing Company on Atlantic Avenue had their heads covered  hijabs, snapbacks, church derbies, pork pies, bandannas, kufi skull caps  and their hands full of products, samples and numbered tickets. The tickets are needed to keep order and flow at this foodie dreamscape, which resembles an active bazaar with a jumble of containers and barrels, crowded counters and overstocked shelves. The action is all inside, but the stores primary advocate was out front, telling stories.Charlie Sahadi, the 72-year-old family patriarch, is a natural storyteller. And one of his favorites is the tale of the family business, which began in the late 19th century as an importing enterprise in Lower Manhattan. His father, Wade Sahadi, emigrated from Lebanon in the early 20th century to join the business. He eventually migrated to Brooklyn in the late 1940s, to the building on Atlantic Avenue between Court and Clinton Streets, where the shop still operates. The street looks very different today from the way it looked then, or even recently.If you told me 20 years ago, Mr. Sahadi said, pointing out the front window of his office above the original storefront, that Id be operating across the street from Barneys New York, I would have had you institutionalized.Though many of the Middle Eastern businesses that once surrounded Sahadis have been replaced by ones catering to a different Brooklyn, Sahadis has endured. The store is practically a case study in how to run a business in a gentrifying neighborhood. So when a new kind of customer started showing up in the 1980s, someone who wanted foie gras in addition to baba ghanoush, Mr. Sahadi took notice.It made for much better conversation, he said. It worked two ways: The new customers were picking up traditional Middle Eastern products, and the original clientele was happy to discover specialty items from other parts of the world.This successful amalgamation of tastes and cultures also created a need for much more floor space, so Sahadis tripled in size, with additions in 1985 and 2012, on either side of the original storefront. Within the exposed-brick walls are offerings from all over the world, fresh and frozen, candied and brined. There are separate stations for baked and deli goods, fruits and nuts, cheese, coffee, desserts and Arabic pizza. The rows and rows of shelves seem to have everything from anywhere that can be put into a jar. All of it, from every station and every shelf, is presided over by an army of attendants who are always happy to explain or discuss or dispense a free taste.For the past five years, Abby Sunshine, 35, has been regularly coming to Sahadis from Manhattan. I love all the options, she said. But they also let me try everything, and thats what I want.Even though Mr. Sahadi, after nearly 50 years in charge, supposedly retired in January, he often can still be found on site. The official operations of Sahadis have been passed to Mr. Sahadis brother Bob; his daughter, Christine Whelan, 49; and his son, Ron, 44.It was Ron Sahadi who assumed his fathers usual post on that blustery Saturday, standing by the registers, observing the well-ordered throng, telling stories."}
{"text": "PUMPKINFLOWERSA Soldiers StoryBy Matti Friedman242 pp. Algonquin Books. $25.95.Israel, like America, is an idea, not just a place. As a result, it has been subjected to much metaphorical thinking  it is a refuge, a beacon, a start-up company, an unlikely flower blooming in an unforgiving desert.Since the Middle Easts descent into chaos following the Iraq war and the aftermath of the Arab Spring, not to mention the crash and burn of the peace process, Israelis have had their own preferred metaphor for their current situation: an isolated hilltop fortress in hostile territory, where a semblance of normal life persists within concrete barriers. In Pumpkinflowers, Matti Friedmans sober and striking new memoir, this metaphor finds its sharpest articulation.Friedman was, literally, stationed at such an outpost. Canadian by birth, he served in the Israeli Army during the late 1990s in the last years of its military presence in southern Lebanon. The security zone, as it was known, was made up of a series of fortified lookouts, each surrounded by trenches and housing little more than bare bunkers. The army gave these lonely outposts unusually perky names like Red Pepper and Basil. Friedman was stationed at the Pumpkin.The book is as much about Friedmans time in Lebanon as it is a narrative of the Pumpkins final years, and especially the young soldiers who fought and died to defend it. Friedman is haunted by the deaths. By the 1990s, the rationale for Israels continued presence in Lebanon  a remnant of its 1982 invasion  had worn thin. When a midair helicopter collision near the border in 1997 took the lives of 73 soldiers on their way to the security zone, grieving mothers began a movement demanding that Israel evacuate, which it did in 2000.Friedmans own time at the Pumpkin is filled with a sense of inertia and pointlessness  like the trench warfare of World War I, he often notes. But there is also intimacy and brotherhood. Theres the absurdity of all the waiting and watching, as well as the adrenaline rush and confusion when the boredom is punctuated by spectacular violence, streaking out of the sky. Friedman understands, too, as few outsiders do, how central the military is to Israeli identity  as much a rite of passage before adulthood as a matter of citizenship. A weekend leave from the base was for these young soldiers, he writes, a time when your father hugged you and your mother cooked you dinner, and the washing machine whirled green as you fell asleep in the room where you grew up. The collective portrait puts Pumpkinflowers on a par with Tim OBriens The Things They Carried  its Israeli analog.In the books last section, Friedman describes a secret trip he took to Lebanon in 2002, two years after the end of his service and the Israeli withdrawal. He used his Canadian passport to enter and roam the enemy country, stand again on the hilltop of the Pumpkin and visit the neighboring town, which he had seen only through a gun sight.The Pumpkin had taken on a larger meaning for Friedman both as a precursor to the counterinsurgency warfare everyone would get to know in Iraq and Afghanistan and as the kind of place that incubated the hardened and disillusioned Israelis of today, unwilling to entertain hopes for peace. A fortressed existence has made them good at blocking out the rest of the Middle East, imagining themselves somewhere else, Silicon Valley perhaps, or wedged between Paris and Berlin.Remembering an improvised, shirtless, sweaty rave inside one of the Pumpkins bunkers, Friedman sees a microcosm of the Israeli condition: Laughter inside the perimeter; outside, the quiet of the trench and young men in guard posts. The Pumpkin is a metaphor born of practicality and a truly bad situation all around. But its also one with a dreadful portent. The rave came to an end, and the scruffy outpost Friedman used to call home was eventually mined with explosives, blown up and abandoned."}

Forget about the possibility of a North America-based pro sports team ever winning against 5,000-to-1 odds. North American leagues do not have a promotion-relegation system, allowing oligarch owners, who extort taxpayer money to build sports palaces and improve surrounding infrastructure, to preserve the status quo of a healthy revenue stream. This also operates against the fans best interests. Games involving perennially losing teams like the Philadelphia 76ers or the Tennessee Titans are often boring, one-sided affairs. End-of-season matches always have something at stake for the teams at the bottom of the standings in the European soccer leagues, so the buzz of a match involving a relegation-threatened squad stimulates fan interest, and these matches are often very entertaining.BEN MYERS, Harvard, Mass.Permanent Olympic SitesTo the Sports Editor:Re The Calm Beneath the Storm, April 28: Even if Dilma Rousseff is forced from office, the Olympics will most likely go on. But how many times have the Olympics been threatened by host-country politics? Boycotts of the 1980 Moscow Games and the 1984 Los Angeles Games almost crippled the Olympic movement. Since then, we have witnessed bribery and corruption scandals, human rights violations, decaying facilities, huge cost overruns and environmental destruction.Heres a suggestion: Create permanent Olympic centers for the Summer Games on the five continents represented by the five Olympic rings, and rotate the Winter Games among identified sites in North America, Europe and Asia. The centers would be for-profit, commercial operations open year-round for a variety of programs, including the Youth Olympic Games and other national and international championships.Awarding the Games to international locations served the Olympic goals of promoting peace and international understanding, stimulated the expansion of sport and encouraged health and fitness movements. But the Games cannot further these ambitions if they are constantly being dumped into the middle of political turmoil.JEFFREY O.

{"text": "Marilyn Snell craved time to herself in the summer of 2012 so that she could take stock of the emotional losses enveloping her life in San Francisco.She found that time on the Greek island of Kythira, at a friends early-19th-century home. There, she stayed in a room that was once a bakery, white-walled with a curved ceiling and a fireplace that had served as the bakery oven.A close friend and co-worker had died of cancer in 2010, after months of her caring for him. She was still struggling with sadness and the lessons he had taught her about death and human connections. Her mother, too, needed care during that time after two open-heart surgeries.I was in a moment where I needed to survive, and figure things out, said Ms. Snell, now 57 and a freelance environmental journalist.Long single, she favored solitude. Yet, alone in that white space and remembering her late friends belief in the lasting strength of relationships, she concluded, I needed to think of unfinished beginnings and set miscommunications straight.At the top on that list was Gregory Williams, a man with whom she had had a relationship until he broke it off 24 years earlier. She knew nothing about his life since then other than that he had married.Before departing for Greece, she had attempted to reach out to him through Facebook. His response to her inquiry offered little encouragement. It was just kind of, Thank you, she recalled.Back home in San Francisco, stronger and healthier, she signed on to Facebook and tried reaching out again.Her earlier relationship with Mr. Williams, which spanned five years, began in 1984, while they were commuting from Berkeley on Bay Area Rapid Transit to downtown San Francisco. Mr. Williams, a newly minted architect, couldnt help looking her way one night when the two found themselves the sole passengers on a train car rumbling under San Francisco Bay.I wasnt going to just sit there, recalled Mr. Williams, now also 57, who crossed the car to introduce himself. By the time he disembarked, they had exchanged phone numbers. Lunch followed, and then museum visits, reggae concerts and road trips. They shared a passion for the arts and nature.He was raised in Los Angeles and Cerritos, Calif., where his mother, Julietta, taught in the Cerritos public schools for 33 years, and his father, Amos, a Korean War veteran, retired after 36 years as a mail carrier in Los Angeles. Ms. Snell is from Phoenix, where her father, Richard, had been the chairman of Pinnacle West Capital, which owns Arizonas largest electricity utility, and where her mother, Alice, was, among other things, deputy associate superintendent in the vocational division of the Arizona Department of Education.Hes quiet, and an independent, deeply creative thinker, Ms. Snell said of Gregory Williams, who was later a founder of Mass Architecture & Design, a Los Angeles firm with commissions that have included several notable homes and restaurants and the Coffee & Milk cafe at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. I love the way he helps me see the world from a different angle.For his part, Mr. Williams said, Weve always had very similar spirits, similar life views, whether theyre social, political, family values.When she entered a graduate journalism program at the University of Southern California, he left his job at a San Francisco urban historic preservation group to join her in his hometown, where they lived briefly with his parents, who invited Ms. Snell to stay in a spare room for a few months during her studies.They just really epitomize to me what a loving relationship should be, Mr. Williamss mother said. They hold hands. Its so warm. With regard to the biracial nature of the relationship, Mrs. Williams said that she and the young couple did not blink, although even today some people outside their families and friends still blink, they still do, at the notion of interracial marriage.In time, Ms. Snells journalism career took root when she worked at a Los Angeles-based political and cultural journal. She has got this profound sense of empathy that seems to affect everything she does, said Omar Dajani, a friend.Over time, however, irritants began building. They faced the same challenges that many young couples do, with communication lapses, self-centeredness and thoughts that there might be something better out there.The couple say that they also lacked the insight to discuss race and class, particularly at a time when acceptance was harder to come by.I wanted to be my own person, not having her familys position dictating things, Mr. Williams said of his decision to break off their earlier relationship. He began dating other women a year later, and, after two years lapsed, he called to tell her he was getting married.It broke my heart, said Ms. Snell, who returned to San Francisco. He had always been the one for me. Over time, she had a series of relationships, some serious, she said, but I came to love my solitary life.She threw herself into work as executive editor at the Utne Reader, followed by eight years as senior writer at Sierra, a national magazine published by the Sierra Club.When she sought to contact Mr. Williams on Facebook in 2012, she did not know that during the year before he had separated from his wife of 18 years, with whom he has two sons.Mr. Williams responded more positively to her second Facebook inquiry, telling her, Ive been thinking of you. He soon flew to San Francisco, hopeful but apprehensive. I was thinking, I will get into her car, and we will have nothing to say, and it would be horrible.But they clicked immediately, and after seeing a play, they went dancing at a bar called the Make Out Room, where, as Ms. Snell put it, the sparks started flying.Hes self-confident without being egoistic, Ms. Snell said. Hes his own man. She also found that the responsibility of fatherhood had changed him.It was in a rented cottage in Point Reyes, Calif., that they began working off those 24 years of hurt and separation and quickly came to realize how close they still were, Mr. Williams said. After dinner, they wrapped themselves in blankets and sat side by side on a long side porch, staring out at the dark forest and talking about their past insecurities and poor communication.I grew up Catholic, and it was kind of like confession, Mr. Williams said. You dont see the person. You just spill out your soul. I told her, Lets see if theres something here. And the only way we could do this was to see each other exclusively and see if theres something there thats worth rebuilding.Ms. Snell said: I just felt it was a sacred moment. I realized then, I really want this. The next day, walking on the beach, Mr. Williams asked how she saw herself growing old.I said I had always thought Id live by myself in a shack in the desert, she said. He said: Thats terrible. Youre not going to be by yourself. Youre going to be with me.He suggested a larger shack, a nurturing space with an interior courtyard. She began talking solar panels and rain barrels. They envisioned a future that would bring their two passions of design and nature together.They began being in touch every day, mostly by text, morning, afternoon and night, and they usually spoke by phone at night, he said.Cognizant of their parents ages and building health issues, they began discussing marriage 18 months ago. Mr. Williams met with her parents in Phoenix and asked for permission. They agreed.He wanted to make the formal request, Alice Snell said later. It was refreshing.He proposed to Ms. Snell in a courtyard at the back of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For her engagement ring, Ms. Snell chose a family ring missing a stone, which was fitted with a garnet that she and Mr. Williams found for $9 in downtown Los Angeles in the Jewelry District.They were married April 22 in the chapel at the Beverly Hills Courthouse, with Ronald L. Engen, a deputy commissioner of civil marriages for Los Angeles County, presiding. It was a simple ceremony, with the bride, the groom and Mr. Williamss sister, Cynthia Williams, who served as witness.They followed that up with a celebration on April 30 at the Snell home in Phoenix, attended by 150 guests, including Mr. Williamss two sons, Gyasi Amos Williams, now 22, and Kwame Clyde Williams, now 15.The couple plans to build a home in the Williamses old neighborhood, south of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a version of the shack they designed while in Point Reyes. It will have commercial space on the bottom floor: They want a community where people know each other.Strangely, we are very different people, and we came apart because of our differences, Ms. Snell said. But when we came together, we found a way to build things."}
{"text": "We didnt know each other was how Ann Wiener, from the 10th floor, described Peter Glebo, from up on 18.But he had thought of a way to meet neighbors like her in their building, a 27-story Art Deco tower at 310 Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side of Manhattan known as the Master Apartments: He would photograph them and display the images in gallery space in the lobby. Yes, the building has its own gallery space, started a couple of years ago  a long wall opposite the front desk that is carefully lit and maintained by two residents who volunteered as curators. If it wasnt uptown, it could be a downtown scene.Mr. Glebo  the president of Tommy Tune Inc., the business operation of the ageless song and dance man, who is also a choreographer and director  is himself a triple threat. A designer, photographer and painter, his works have been seen in gallery shows at the National Arts Club and Art Basel Miami Beach.Mr. Glebo mulled overtures from his buildings curators and realized how little he knew about his surroundings, about the vertical community that inhabits 310 Riverside Drive.I live here, but I really dont live here  Im always on the road with Tommy, he said. I travel quite a lot. But Ive always been curious who are my neighbors, so I asked if I could exhibit people who live and work in the building. Have camera, will travel the hallways.He said the curators, Jan Fort (who lives down the hall from Mr. Glebo on 18) and Michael Alicia (from 19), liked the idea but told him, We have to get approved by the board.That would be the co-op board. Everyone in New York has heard about co-op boards that proved to be the most persnickety of the many many-headed hydras exerting authority over daily life.They wanted a sample, he said. I did Carol Channing with the hot pink. A nonresident.The hot pink was a strikingly bright color wash that he applied to a black-and-white print. The portrait of Ms. Channing was hung in the mailroom, and a building-wide email was sent out. It brought about 50 replies from residents interested in setting up shoots. After they coordinated schedules, he photographed about 25.Peter wasnt content just to do pictures and put them up, said Mr. Tune, who stopped by the building on Thursday for a look before the official opening (a little crowd had gathered several days before, when the photographs were being hung). He said, How can I make it site-specific? Using the building as a backdrop was a genius idea, Mr. Tune said.Mr. Tune knows the building  he said he had lived there briefly, years ago  and it is a building with a history. Built in 1929, it was conceived by, and for, Nicholas Roerich, another artist whose name is trailed by a list of accomplishments in different fields. He was a painter, a poet and a peace activist, to name only three, and his fans included Einstein and the Roosevelts (Franklin and Eleanor). He once had a museum in the building.As Mr. Glebo made his rounds, he photographed more than neighbors: He did portraits of the buildings staff, including the porters and the superintendent, Enes Radoncic.Some of the residents poured tea when he showed up, and some poured out stories. They didnt clean up their apartments for me or clean up their lives for me, he said.So he heard about a much-loved cat that was dying. He inspected a prized ficus tree. (He said it has grown so large in its owners living room that if it had to evacuate, it could not squeeze through the front door.)On the ninth floor, he took 75 or so images of Lana Gersman, who, as the makeup artist Lana G., has been called in when the last four presidents were in New York. He photographed her in front of paintings she has done  using makeup, not paint  and during the shoot, she had a revelation about one of them that made her want to redo it.He said, Stay there, let me keep on shooting you right there, she recalled, adding that the shoot took only 15 minutes. But it was the most intense 15 minutes of my life.Mr. Glebo shot Ms. Fort in even less time. They had penciled in a three-hour block, but first there was a delay, something about a run to a Home Depot for garden supplies. They both have terraces. And then there was the weather.It was absolutely pouring rain, Ms. Fort said. I thought, Ive done this a thousand times. I used to do a lot of print modeling. Peter literally stood on a stool and peered over the trees that divide our terrace. He went click, click, click, click, and we were done.He did not show her the images before he chose one and printed it. I had to trust that whatever he chose was going to be fine, she said. When she finally saw the one he had picked out, her reaction was that it was more than fine: Wonderful, she said.Ms. Wiener, on the 10th floor, said that Mr. Glebo was intensely interested in my surroundings. She has a corner apartment, so there were the views, but the Hudson River is nowhere in her portrait.When you walk in, the first thing you see is all of these photographs taped to the wall, Mr. Glebo recalled. She said, These are my grandchildren and people I love. I dont even want to frame them. She took her finger and opened a pocket door, and there were more. So many, in fact, that some had to be cropped out.He also heard about the ficus tree, for it belongs to her.I must have had it since 96, she said. She brought it with her when she moved into the building after her husbands death in 2002. When she heard that Mr. Glebo had described it as gigantic and so big it will never be able to leave through the front door, she said: Well, I got it in. Im not sure I want to move."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Civil Liberties vs. Security as Jihadists Come Home (April 27):European foreign fighters pose a security challenge that is by its very nature transnational. However, European states are already under binding international legal obligations imposed by the U.N. Security Council. Resolution 2178, unanimously adopted in September 2014, requires states to ensure that foreign fighters are brought to justice and to establish criminal offences for traveling abroad for terrorist purposes. Furthermore, a new E.U. directive on combating terrorism, which would criminalize foreign fighter travel, is currently being debated in Brussels and likely to be adopted shortly. From a legal point of view, European governments thus have no choice but to implement these obligations and to prosecute foreign fighters upon their return, whether effective or not.It is disquieting that international efforts to counter the foreign fighter threat lack a clear definition of terrorism and contain nebulously defined criminal offences. Europe must resolve its foreign fighter conundrum without losing its credibility as a guardian of the rule of law and fundamental rights.TARIK GHERBAOUIFlorence, Italy"}
{"text": "Welcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social-media presences of celebrities.I have no idea what a chowder goblin is, only that I want desperately to be one. They first appeared in a tweet from the musician Perfume Genius: I just lovingly ladled chowder in to [sic] my life partners bowl, my own bowl and 8 golden ramekins for the chowder goblins.Its not an especially unusual Perfume Genius tweet, in that most of them are unusual  his feed is bizarrely amusing in the inane, fuzzy way of late-night Adult Swim, but as with Adult Swim, theres a real cleverness behind it (and anyway, hes sober). Perfume Genius is the stage name of Mike Hadreas, whose chowder, apparently, is real, though Im not sure I can say the same for the goblins.Chowder goblins are just one of the many fantastical elements  and the many other goblins  that haunt the witchy tapestry of Perfume Geniuss Twitter. The overall effect is a kind of free-associated fairy tale, like someone live-tweeting a lucid fever dream. The longer you try to follow it, the more sense it appears to be making  themes emerge, and it seems there may be a deeper meaning to all of it. His account has a distinct aesthetic thats difficult to pin down: something like light-wash denim Dark Crystal Bonnie Raitt, or subdued, pleated-satin @witch_ebooks. Perfume Genius himself seems thematically torn, and conducted a Twitter poll about the style direction for his next album: blue velvet vapelord vs. normcore goblin king. (Whether thats blue velvet like the movie, the song or grandmas track suit is open to interpretation, but the Labyrinth reference is clear.) Blue-velvet vapelord won out, but as far as his Twitter goes, its clear the two are not mutually exclusive.Wherever his next album lands, stylewise, Perfume Geniuss social media is unusual for more than its aesthetics. Hes a major recording artist who, instead of tweeting concert dates and music videos, tweets about blouses, vaping, aliens and butts (his own butt and the butts of others). Becoming famous seems to have had no effect on the content of his brand, and compared with other recording artists, hes an anomaly in his apparent disregard for any sort of #branding. His laconic bio declares the account Official Tweets  which is both technically correct, since hes a verified user, and a smirking acknowledgment of at the total lack of anything authoritiative across his fairly inscrutable feed. If anything, his unmediated presence has enabled him to connect more deeply with a fan base that appreciates his unfettered oddity for what it is, a weirdness uniquely suited to the medium of Twitter.Perfume Geniuss queer identity is palpable in his self-presentation, both physically  Ive yet to see an image of him without a flawless high-gloss manicure  and artistically. Each of his three albums deals explicitly with same-sex desire and relationships, and a teaser ad for one of his music videos, which featured the gay pornographic actor Arpad Miklos without a shirt on, was pulled from YouTube for being non family safe [sic]. Perfume Genius is a queer celebrity whose fame benefits queer visibility, but even more vitally for his queer fans, he is a queer celebrity versed and conversant in queer culture.Perfume Geniuss blouses and tentacles exist in a lexicon as rich and specific as queer culture itself, one that becomes legible, if not sensible, to devotees. Hilarious though the chowder goblins are at face value, in the context of his elaborate Twitter fable, they take on a richer significance as recurring figures, a kind of entourage of the weird. Consciously or not, they become stand-ins for fans  that is, Lady Gagas Little Monsters, Beyoncs Beyhive and Perfume Geniuss Chowder Goblins.In a feature for Out.com, Perfume Genius named half a dozen artists and cultural objects that inspired his most recent album, a list that reads like a works-cited page for his Twitter account. Even the most disparate elements seem at home in his referential cosmos, from Suspiria to Roy Orbison to a folk-music group called the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. Theres an unexpected ickiness to his aesthetic, with its goblins and tentacles, and even its blouses to an extent. His counteraesthetic is radically queer in its appreciation of the gross and the bizarre, and contrasts with the icy handsomeness he exhibits in photo shoots and live performances. The tension between beauty and grossness is central to Perfume Geniuss self-presentation, as well as to a new mode of queerness that has emerged on social media, one that values powerful strangeness above simple beauty. In a community that often prizes pretty white cis men over queers of other stripes, this counter-aesthetic is notable, particularly from someone who, if it suited him, could certainly look the part. Instead, with his goblin horde, Perfume Genius is a vanguard of a new kind of public queerness.One of my favorite Perfume Genius tweets reads: I have a dedicated printer that just prints out pictures of Sade all day and I just sit in front of it yelling YASSSSSSSS. Its a hilarious image, and it also echoes a particular slice of gay Internet culture: unmodulated, conditioned responses to kweenly stimuli. Perfume Geniuss dry take doesnt quite rise to the level of a critique (its his printer, after all), but it implicates him and other online gays in a certain mode of Internet fandom, however defensible  Perfume Genius himself once tweeted, Is it ok to stop being friends with someone if you find out they dont like Sade. (It is.)The Sade printer is an idea uniquely legible to Perfume Geniuss queer followers, not in its function but in its significance: In acknowledging that some part of me actually wants and would use a Sade printer, and in considering the number of unironic yases I have uttered in my life, Im forced to consider my orientation to Sade-as-personal-kween. A printer for Beyonc, Rihanna or Britney would serve the same purpose, and hold the same appeal, if Im being honest. There is something earnest and admirably uncritical about the gay communitys hagiography of female pop stars, but by the same token, there is something unconsidered and knee-jerk to it. Sade (or Beyonc, or Rihanna, or Britney) as a cultural icon is a great deal more than her music  she is an attitude; Smooth Operator is a feeling. Perfume Genius, too, is an attitude, and his Twitter an emotional state. Scrolling back through his tweets is like having a dedicated Perfume Genius printer, each tweet a new, more bizarre vision of the world than the one before, each feels worthy of a hearty YASSSSSSSS."}

{"text": "Matt Harvey struck out 10 San Diego Padres on Sunday, the first time this season he has reached double figures in that category.During the course of six innings, he looked dominant at times, but once again he had trouble in the middle of the game. He surrendered a two-run bomb in the bottom of the fifth inning to catcher Christian Bethancourt, who had just three career homers to that point, and only escaped that inning with a 3-2 lead when a tag play at home plate was generously called in favor of the Mets.So what to make of Harveys seventh start of the season? He threw consistently harder than he had at any previous point this season, struck out the side in the first inning, gave up just four hits and two runs, and, shades of Bartolo Colon, hit a long drive of his own that almost went out of the park.Still, when you pitch only six innings, as Harvey did Sunday, a lot of things can happen after you leave the game.And in the case of the Mets, they only won the game  and moved back into first place in the National League East ahead of the Washington Nationals  because of the eighth-inning dominance of the left-handed reliever Antonio Bastardo.So while this surely was Harveys best start of the season, and one that will leave everyone around the Mets encouraged, it still feels as if there is a ways to go for a pitcher who was fearsome for much of 2013 and reasonably tough in 2015 in his comeback from Tommy John surgery, but who has basically been a work in progress through the first chunk of the 2016 season.It is worth noting, for instance, that Harvey has yet to pitch into the seventh inning this season. A year ago, he pitched at least seven innings in five of his first 10 starts in April and May.Pitching only six innings  and Harvey has gone that far in only three of his seven starts  inevitably puts more pressure on the teams relievers. And sure enough on Sunday, the Mets bullpen balked home a run in the seventh inning and appeared about to blow the game in the bottom of the eighth until Bastardo came in with the bases loaded and no outs and got two strikeouts and a pop-up to protect a 4-3 lead that Jeurys Familia closed out in the ninth.Harvey is now 3-4 with an E.R.A. that is more than four runs a game. It is logical to think that he is still feeling the effects of his war-horse effort in 2015, when he ended up pitching 216 innings in the regular season and postseason.That was more innings than anyone  most notably his agent, Scott Boras  wanted to see him throw after missing all of 2014, but the Mets were on a roll, eventually making it to the World Series, so it simply became almost unthinkable for him to sit down.He did not. He even insisted on going out to pitch the ninth inning of Game 5 of the World Series against the better judgment of his manager, Terry Collins. Kansas City ended up tying the score in that inning and winning the Series a few innings later, and Harvey was left to brood about all of it during the off-season.This season has not been any easier for him to deal with than that ninth inning was last November, but after Sundays game, in which he threw 102 pitches, Harvey was clearly upbeat, telling reporters that his mechanics were better, his command was better, everything was better.Now he just needs to make it into the seventh inning, and then eventually the eighth. But maybe forget about the ninth."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  The composers we know as Minimalists are really more often maximalists. Think of the relentless surging waterfall of Philip Glasss arpeggios or the billboard-bright neon glow of Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians.But no one associated with the Minimal school makes that adjective seem as inadequate  as downright silly  as Louis Andriessen, 76, whose dizzying, perplexing new opera, Theater of the World, was given its premiere by the Los Angeles Philharmonic on Friday at Walt Disney Concert Hall here.The characteristic everything-but-the-kitchen-sink quality of Mr. Andriessens theatrical works will be familiar to anyone who recently saw his De Materie (composed in the 1980s) performed at the Park Avenue Armory. The ostensible excesses of Heiner Goebbelss production  crowding in serenely floating zeppelins, ballroom dancers and an eerie, poignant flock of sheep  felt right at home in Mr. Andriessens extravagant imagination, in which boogie-woogie rubs elbows with antique polyphony.His most recent opera, La Commedia (2008), was even more ambitious, taking on no less a figure than Dante in a work that moved freely around hell and heaven in five grand scenes. The score sprawled through big-band jazz, folk melodies and long passages of hovering, clanging percussion  a kind of relentless abstraction of bells tolling.Mr. Andriessen doesnt do anything very different in Theater of the World, which, to be precise, he classifies not as an opera but as a grotesque stagework in nine scenes and just under two hours. The piece plays with the life and work of Athanasius Kircher, the 17th-century German Jesuit scholar and polymath whose dozens of books included studies on Egypt, China, geology and medicine. (Appropriate for a treatment of a formidable linguist, Helmut Kraussers libretto shifts, sometimes with surreal speed, between Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin and English.)A Borges character 300 years before Borges, Kircher has enjoyed a vogue in recent decades, with his widely scattered interests seen by some as a premonition of the postmodern ranginess of contemporary thinkers and artists, including Mr. Andriessen. Theater of the World finds Kircher near the end of his life, guided through a stylized journey by a boy (sung with creepy precision by the soprano Lindsay Kesselman) who seems harmlessly curious at first but eventually begins to act savagely, even satanically. (Is he angel or devil?)They travel from Rome to ancient Egypt to the tower of Babel, accompanied by characters who come and go, seemingly at random. Kirchers publisher, Janssonius (Steven van Watermeulen), sings about their contracts; Janssonius, Kircher and Pope Innocenzo XI (Marcel Beekman), a patron, have what can only be described as a brief threeway.Gradually, and very obliquely, we get some slight sense of Kirchers rambling interests  I found and named the pathogen of the plague, he sings, I designed hydraulic organs, horoscope machines, a reconstruction of the seating plan in Noahs Ark  as well as his anxieties about dying and being proven right. (The baritone Leigh Melrose gives him an impassioned, even agonized voice and presence.)In an epilogue, four figures representing posterity  Descartes, Goethe, Leibniz and Voltaire  weigh in on Kirchers legacy. He knew nothing about anything, Leibniz sniffs. But the four eventually conclude: His name will be remembered.Like La Commedia, Theater of the World is a lavish, bawdy, enthusiastically semi-coherent fantasia on early modern culture, but Mr. Andriessen has grown ever more expert as a technician. While eclecticism is now the compositional norm (much more so than when he was first experimenting with bold stylistic mixtures in the 1960s and 70s), Mr. Andriessen was there first, and he still does it best. His quick pivots  from the melancholy Romantic effusion of an arialike passage, for example, to an orchestral riff on the Champs mambo-lite 50s pop number Tequila  are so agile and persuasive that you sometimes forget to notice that the juxtapositions are plainly, intentionally ridiculous.Much of the score, conducted here with fervor by Reinbert de Leeuw, feels somber, starting with the sighing motif that opens the work and recurs throughout. But there are jittery passages for three murderous witches, and Mr. Andriessen, as he has for decades, likes to send his orchestra into churning, repetitive heaves, like an old-fashioned engine going through its paces.The mystical Mexican poet Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz, who knew Kirchers work, is here an angelic presence high above the stage, the object of his long-distance adoration. Sung beautifully by Cristina Zavalloni, she gets the pure, high lines that have long been a fixture of Mr. Andriessens medieval-flavored writing for voices.Juanas poetry is also featured in John Adamss 2000 nativity oratorio, El Nio, nearly as teeming as Theater of the World; the two works share a frenetic, patchwork quality. But Mr. Adams practices a gentler, more ingratiating  an over all more American  form of eclecticism than does the Dutch Mr. Andriessen, whose idiom is generally harder-edged, even when hes quoting pop standards or tango.Beyond this piece being an impressive, if faintly self-congratulatory, celebration of Mr. Andriessens capacious  indeed, Kircheresque  skills, it is hard to tell just what it means. Its tensions are too diffuse to create even stylized drama, and Kircher comes to life as a character only occasionally, as in an endearing moment when he enters the orchestra to play a keyboard with two fingers, a delighted amateur.And instead of organizing the clutter, the tiresomely antic production by Pierre Audi  recently named the Park Avenue Armorys artistic director and who is the longtime director of the Dutch National Opera, where Theater of the World will travel next month  redoubles it. A blood-red frame looms over the stage, serving as a screen for inky, blurry, more or less incomprehensible animations by the Quay Brothers.Florence von Gerkans costumes are wonderful, stark, bizarre  cutting, like the music, a wide swath through the Renaissance, geometric abstraction and contemporary references like the Batman symbol. But the staging feels needlessly unfocused  the libretto is more literal-minded than you would have known by seeing this presentation  and doesnt give enough assistance to a work that, while intriguing and accomplished, needs it."}
{"text": "James Whitehurst  is president and chief executive of Red Hat, the worlds largest open source software company.Q. You joined Delta Air Lines at noon on Sept. 11, 2001, as acting treasurer. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2005, by which time you had been promoted to chief operating officer and had to lay off tens of thousands of people. Talk about managing through crisis!A. I got promoted about 12 weeks before we filed for bankruptcy. That was really my first major leadership role, with 80,000 people working for me. I was 35 years old and I was too nave to know I should have said no [to the promotion]. Im naturally a very calm person and that helped, but it was really brutal.One of the key things I learned is that in this type of situation, your goal should not be to comfort or make people feel better, but to be open and honest. Tell people what its like and allow them to make the decisions that work best for them. A lot of leaders want to show a ray of optimism, but all you do is shade the truth. Be honest and say, This is what it is and this is what were going to do about it.The other lesson Ive learned is that once youve made the decision you believe in, you have to stick by it, because youre making these changes for the good of the whole. This helps give you the fortitude to do these painful things if you have the clear vision of where youre going. I think one of the things leaders have trouble with in difficult times is that they know they have this problem, but theyre not going to change their team because its too painful. But you never hear anybody say, I moved with that change of personnel too fast. Its more, I wish Id done that a year ago. Its important to have the fortitude to say, Im going to do this, and it starts with my team.Q. Moving from Delta, an airline, to Red Hat, a technology company, must have been a culture shock. How did you handle it?A. I knew it would be very different, but it was still a shock. I came in with a strategic point of view: Were going to focus on two products, were going to do a five-year plan, set goals  which we ultimately did. I was told, O.K., how are we going to engage all the employees?Early on, I remember asking some people for a report about something and when I circled back for it, I was told: Oh, we didnt do it; we thought it was a bad idea! I remember telling my wife, This is major insubordination. And it wasnt like people were even embarrassed about it  it was like it was just normal. During the first six months I was pedaling hard, trying to get up to speed, traveling all the time, and they would say, Weve just done that new product category. I said, When were you going to tell me?It took me a while to realize things were happening bottom-up and that it was not necessarily chaos, it was just different. It took me about 18 month to embrace it, and change my management style to fit in that corporate culture.Q. Youve been a strong advocate for open organizations as a catalyst for business innovation ever since. Is this type of management style applicable to any business?A. Yes and no. Traditional organization structures are very good at optimizing in a static environment, when you are trying to orchestrate people to do what you want them to do, and also in a world when those roles dont have a lot of variance in potential output. Youre just trying to optimize for efficiency, and individual variance in performance doesnt matter that much.But in knowledge-based environments where the difference between an average and a great programmer, for example, is 10X, thats a very different situation. In that environment where you want that 10X, maximizing that discretionary effort to get it is incredibly important. And in an environment that is moving very quickly, you cant plan and then execute and then optimize around that, while its all moving too fast for the plan. You need to have an organization that can self-regulate and react quickly. You need to create an environment where people can execute and make changes as they need to.Q. How do you achieve that?A. You have to go to work every day remembering your team is there because they choose to be there and not because they have to. It doesnt mean you have to be in a sell mode all the time, but if you go in thinking, Im a leader because people choose to follow me, it creates a very different mental dynamic. A leaders role is to create an environment where people can do their best work, and not to tell them what to do and monitor how they are doing it. Thats how you get the lowest common denominator out of people.The whole point of an open organization is to relax the constraints of management to create the environment in which your team can do their best work. And what is most important is to cascade this philosophy through every manager in the organization. I know that if something happens to me tomorrow, nothing will change at Red Hat because its really built into who we are and what we do.Another important point is that you have to have a deep belief that a team will come up with a better solution than any individual, including yourself. If you think you have the better answer and just go through the motions, it will never work.Q. Is it a democracy, then?A. No. At times Ive made very unpopular decisions. The key is that you never want to surprise people. So you must engage them first in dialogue. In a traditional model, you have a small number of people making the decision at the top, and then you announce, This is what were doing. Then the organization doesnt really do it, so you bring in management consultants to help you do it. And then the C.E.O. says, This is awful; my organization is resistant to change.I could plan the most extraordinary vacation to Tahiti and buy the tickets to surprise my wife, but frankly I dont think she would be happy if she hasnt been consulted first. People want to be engaged; you involve them in the decision process. When it comes down to execution it can happen very quickly, even if they disagree with the decision; again, this is not a democracy, but if they feel they were heard, they will generally align and execute.In terms of who is involved, it depends on the decision. You will find that 95 percent of the people dont really want to get involved in the decision, and knowing that they could is enough. So its not like we have thousands of people engaged in most of these decisions.Q. What are the risks in that system of management?A. You have to combine that autonomy youre giving to people with some kind of control. In our case, for example, it could be the budget system or the culture around iterative innovation  where we encourage teams to try small things and if it works, go for bigger milestones. The key thing for managers is to know how much latitude you can give to your teams. From the risk perspective, it is like balancing autonomy within a boundary and making sure you have autonomy within a box."}
{"text": "LONDON  The Leicester we have known and not always loved pulled off an entire season of tenacious victories as it blew away the established order of English soccer. After clinching the title last week, the club arranged a homecoming celebration to be remembered.There was sunshine in Leicester on Saturday, then a downpour. King Power Stadium was packed, and outside, thousands of ticketless fans simply got as close as they could.Inside, the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli was serenading the team and its Italian coach, Claudio Ranieri with Nessun Dorma, the Puccini aria sung before the World Cup final in Rome in 1990 by the Three Tenors  Plcido Domingo, Jos Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti.After that, Bocelli entertained the crowd with Time to Say Goodbye but with his own spin, changing it to Time to Win Again.The smile on the singers face gave the surprise away before the words came out. Grown men celebrated by wearing flat hats in the shape of pizzas, while kids on the shoulders of their dads wore the same shirt declaring Leicester City, Champions! that Bocelli wore underneath his gray jacket.When play finally started Saturday, Leicester ran Everton into the ground. The final score was 3-1. Jamie Vardy, the rags-to-riches star, scored twice and mis-hit a penalty kick so high that he joked he must have been aiming for the club chairmans helicopter in the sky.Andy King, 27, scored the other goal for Leicester. A player who is not often in the starting lineup, King moved to Leicester at 15 after he was released by Chelseas youth academy. In over 300 games since, King has scored in three different leagues as Leicester rose from the third tier to the top of English soccer.Watching over all this was Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Thai billionaire who saved Leicester from insolvency and whose son chose Ranieri as coach a year ago. Vichai stood with his arms folded, impassive as a statue.There really are elements to this story that no fiction writer could make up. Ranieri, the 64-year-old coach, was summoned from unemployment to win a league title for the first time in his life. At 29, Vardy is fighting to be the top scorer in the Premier League this season, four years after he was a part-time player, eking out a living as a factory worker.The essence of this past year has come down to team effort for Leicester. On Tuesday, the morning after the league title was secured, a notice was pinned to the trainers room at the club: Closed due to unforeseen circumstances.After an all-night party at Vardys home, the players were feted all week long. Yet at game time on Saturday, they knuckled down to the hard-running and hard-tackling style that Everton, sadly, had no appetite to resist.The energy of Leicester  the hunger of men who for one reason or another had been bypassed by the bigger clubs  washed over Everton, as it has most opponents. Ranieri, the deceptively avuncular Italian who had flown home to Rome last Monday to have lunch with his mother, explained on the field Saturday what he said when he first met the team last July.I watched them, Ranieri said. They were real friends and hard workers. I said, eh, Believe me, you are better than you think. Trust me, I can make you play good Italian football, hard, clever football in England. What we learned most from the past week came from Ranieris mother, Renata. She might be 96, but in her own engaging interview she told La Repubblica newspaper, We talked a bit about Leicester, but he wanted to feel comfortable.Over steak and chicory, the mother and son talked tactics. Claudio told me he found a group of players who trained like true professionals, Mrs. Ranieri said. And finally everything has fallen into place. My son has found himself.On Saturday, the ground was festooned in ticker tape, the players and the owner cradled the trophy, and Ranieri was doing the endless rounds of interviews. We know very well that next season will be different, he conceded. The fans are dreaming. I say to them, Hey, dont wake up, keep dreaming, keep pushing us. Next season, Leicester will be stretched, as everyone tries to shoot it down off its unlikely perch, and playing in the Champions League will tax its resources, too. The owners will spend, but not extravagantly, and both they and Coach Ranieri have already acknowledged that holding on to the players who emerged as stars this season will come down to negotiations.I tell the players to stay with me one year more, Ranieri said. But if somebody comes to me and says he wants to go, I say go! I want only happy players.He, the club and countless fans around the globe who have seen this group of men grow together have witnessed that it is their unity, the sum of their parts, that brought the unlikely and shocking triumph.Together, they are champions. Apart, they might not be. The temptation of higher salaries in more exalted places will come. But Leicesters message is never give up, never sell yourself short.Unforeseen circumstances, indeed."}

{"text": "Im a worrier. Deadlines, my children, all the time they spend online  you name it, its on my list of worries. I even worry when Im not worried. What am I forgetting to worry about?Turns out Im not alone. Two out of five Americans say they worry every day, according to a new white paper released by Liberty Mutual Insurance. Among the findings in the Worry Less Report: Millennials worry about money. Single people worry about housing (and money). Women generally worry more than men do and often about interpersonal relationships. The good news: Everyone worries less as they get older.People have a love-hate relationship with worry, said Michelle Newman, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the writing of the report. They think at some level that it helps them.The belief that worrying somehow helps to prevent bad things from happening is more common than you might think. Researchers say the notion is reinforced by the fact that we tend to worry about rare events, like plane crashes, and are reassured when they dont happen, but we worry less about common events, like car accidents.But that doesnt mean all worrying is futile. Some worry is actually good for you, said Simon A. Rego, the author of the new report and a cognitive behavioral psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorders and analyzed decades of research on worrying for the paper. Its what we call productive or instructive worry, that can help us take steps to solve a problem.One study published in 2002 recruited 57 young adults and asked them to list their worries in a diary for seven days and rate each worrying episode.When the researchers analyzed the results, they determined that about 20 percent of the worries were about anticipating a negative outcome in the future. But nearly half of all the documented worries reflected a process of problem solving. While that can be constructive, people who worried a lot and couldnt control their worrying were less likely to find a solution to their problem. The researchers, Marianna Szabo, now at the University of Sydney, and Peter F. Lovibond of the University of New South Wales in Australia, concluded that failing to come up with solutions may actually lead to more pathological worrying.In 2007, the same researchers tried to correlate aspects of worrying with specific components of problem solving, like defining the problem, gathering information, generating solutions, evaluating and choosing a solution. Once again, they concluded about half the cognitive content of the worry episodes included attempts to solve a problem. Once people devise a solution, they quit worrying one-third of the time. But people found it hard to stop worrying if they werent satisfied with the solution they came up with.People get caught up in the worry itself, Dr. Newman said. It becomes so habitual, I call it a process looking for content.That kind of worrying can get out of hand. Excessive worriers have multiple domains that they worry about, and if something triggers a worry in one domain, it can seep into other areas, Dr. Rego said, and things can move back and forth like wildfires  once one gets going, it can start other fires as well.Worrying, a cognitive process, should not be confused with anxiety, which generally refers to an emotional state of unease that also includes worry. While 38 percent of people worry every day, most of them do not have anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder, the primary feature of which is excessive and uncontrollable worrying, affects only 2 to 5 percent of the population.Liberty Mutual Insurance officials commissioned the report to better understand how Americans can break the worry cycle, since the insurance business is designed around helping people live with less worry, said Margaret Dillon, the companys executive vice president and chief customer officer for the United States, adding that it could also help them develop the most appropriate products. The report noted, for example, that top worries for people ages 25 to 44 are about finances and housing, she said.If youre worried about your worrying, the report suggests some coping strategies, including:Divide and conquer Try to come up with a solution to a worrisome problem by breaking it down into four parts: defining the problem, clarifying your goals, generating solutions and experimenting with solutions. Grab a pen and paper and brainstorm, the report suggests.Studies have shown this approach can help ease depression and anxiety.Practice mindfulness Choose a routine activity or part of the day and try to experience it fully. Set aside concerns, and try to be in the moment.Schedule a worry session Pick a designated time of day to mull your problems. If a worrying thought enters your mind outside of your scheduled worry session, jot it down so you can think about it during your scheduled worry time. Then get back to your day.Practice accepting uncertainty Notice your thoughts and label them (as in, there is the thought that I cant manage). Let go of tension in your body; soften your forehead, drop your shoulders and relax your grip.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}

{"text": "LONDON  There is one thing to be said for Liam Scarletts new Frankenstein, a lavish costume-and-sets affair at the Royal Ballet that had its premiere at the Royal Opera House here on Wednesday night. It quite possibly has the first dissection scene in a ballet, in which a corpse is dismembered and merry students dance joyously with severed arms and legs.It takes place in a circular anatomy theater (sensationally designed by John MacFarlane), midway through Act 1, soon after the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, arrives at university, where he fervently absorbs new-fangled ideas about science and electricity. In Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus, the 1818 book by Mary Shelley on which the ballet is based, the heros immersion in these disciplines is a dark, tormented affair that leads to the unholy birth of the Creature that he will find so monstrous.In Mr. Scarletts ballet, which is set to a commissioned score by the American composer Lowell Liebermann, the tone of the lecture theater scene is creepy (but not frightening) only because it superimposes dismemberment and grotesquerie upon conventional story ballet tropes. So the professor gestures in a caricatural fashion and the students dance in neat rows around the corpse while carrying severed limbs.The story of Frankenstein has plenty of dance potential. (Wayne Eagling did a one-act version for the Royal Ballet in 1985.) The awakening of the Creature, the newborn lurch into life with its attendant pain and bewilderment, the dark otherness of this alter ego  all can translate perfectly into physical terms, as Danny Boyles 2011 stage version for the National Theater memorably demonstrated. But Mr. Scarlett gives us the birth of the Creature as a sound and light show, with gurgling tubes and dazzling flashes, followed by an anti-climactic rush offstage. And the deeper themes of the novel  parental rejection, death, guilt, the evil within  are mostly lost in a tedious exposition of family backstory that takes up much of the 50-minute first act.Set in the same era as the novel, the ballet opens with a laborious exposition of the adoption of Elizabeth (Laura Morera) into Victors family, then long childhood-play scenes morphing into the adults doing the same thing (mostly throwing a journal around to signify simultaneous bookishness and fun).None of this is vaguely necessary. Without first reading the novel, its virtually impossible, anyway, to understand who half the characters are and what their relationships are to one another. (The ward, the housemaid-who-is-like-a-sister-to-the-ward, the stern housekeeper who is the maids mother, the pregnant mother who looks like another sister.) But Mr. Scarlett, a Royal Ballet School graduate and company member before becoming an artist in residence in 2012, seems locked into a particular company tradition  exemplified by Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan  of leisurely narrative ballets.The effect is of a template. There are children rushing about, dancing maids and footmen, a wronged housemaid subplot and a third-act wedding party, with strong echoes of Ashtons La Valse. There are prostitutes in curly-hair wigs, enthusiastically lifting their skirts. (Just once, oh league of choreographers, could a ballet prostitute have sleek hair and look bored on the job?)There must also be a central pas de deux in each act, so Victor (Federico Bonelli, as good as the role permits), and Elizabeth dutifully undertake rapturous lifts and swooning backbends. Both characters are personality free, but Mr. Bonelli, an elegant dancer, tries to inject some angst. Ms. Morera, technically proficient, retains a single expression of adoration for almost the entire ballet, and appears not to ever notice that her beloved is, er, a little bothered.Mr. Scarlett, a talented choreographer, is perfectly capable of ticking these boxes. But his choreography, like the melodic, unobtrusive score, is barely noticeable on its own terms. (In the program, Mr. Liebermann, referring to a 19th-century composer of tuneful ballet music, speaks of channeling his inner Minkus; he has done this far too effectively.)This is a real issue when it comes to creating an effective physical vocabulary to show us the otherness of the Creature, and his early struggles to become fully human. Despite a raw, scarred appearance, he seems born with the ability to do perfect pirouettes. (The dance equivalent of Shelleys Creature emerging to spout Shakespearean verse.) Steven McRae, who successfully conveys the Creatures pitiable longing for love and acceptance, is nonetheless too polished and virtuosic a dancer to evoke the necessary nightmarishness of Frankensteins alter ego. Only toward the end, when Frankenstein and his Creature dance in a grappling pas de deux of mutual horror and dependence, does the dance finally evoke something of the novels fantastical gothic horror.The limp traditionalism of this Frankenstein, a co-production with the San Francisco Ballet, is dispiriting. Is this how we tell stories in ballet in the 21st century?Frankenstein.  Royal Ballet. Through May 27."}
{"text": "THE NOISE OF TIMEBy Julian Barnes201 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.Its risky business to speak for the dead. In the terrible case of Dmitri Shostakovich, the temptation is strong, because history, in the form of Stalin, didnt allow the composer to speak for himself. Of course, theres the music, but music is reticent about meaning  like a therapist, it prefers you draw your own conclusions.Shostakovichs music presents a particularly thorny nest of meanings and counter-meanings, with upsetting traps of tone. When I was 12 I fell under the spell of his Fifth Symphony, loving its triumphant, thrilling ending. Thirty years later, however, I re-encountered the piece, led by a young and intelligent conductor, who explained to all of us that this glorious ending was an artifact of Leonard Bernsteins intervention, and a betrayal of the real metronome marking and character, all of which was a defiant, ironic swipe at Stalin. He proceeded to conduct the ending half as fast, as though being hammered to death by D major, erasing all the joy Id ever had from it. I trudged glumly from the concert hall. The triumph was fake, I understood that; the joy was enforced. But did I have to be as miserable as Shostakovich was? Was that the point of the music?It is brave of Julian Barnes to take on Shostakovichs puzzle, and his tragedy, in which so many people and factions have a stake. Barness short new novel, The Noise of Time, doesnt just tell the composers story; it presumes to channel him. Much of it is written in a Joycean interior monologue, like at the beginning, where the composer is standing by the elevator, waiting for Stalins secret police to come to take him away:Faces, names, memories. Cut peat weighing down his hand. Swedish water birds flickering above his head. Fields of sunflowers. The smell of carnation oil. The warm, sweet smell of Nita coming off the tennis court.Its lovely, but even at this moment you might wonder: Is this how a man thinks, in the throes of mortal fear for himself and for his family? Or does it sound a tad like a novelist contemplating a man contemplating these things? Shostakovichs musical voice is far more jittery and austere: uncanny, often maniacal, hollow. Either you accept Barness premise, and the resulting style, or you may find yourself dissatisfied, wishing for the narrator of Notes From the Underground to come and make everything feel more neurotic and Russian.Using this third-person Shostakovich, but often switching into an unlocatable voice, like a biographer behind a literary veil, Barnes deftly covers three big episodes in the composers life: denunciation in Pravda and subsequent implication in an assassination plot; his trip to America, where he is humiliated as a Soviet stooge; and lastly, being forced to join the Communist Party. This story is truly amazing, as Barnes knows, an arc of human degradation without violence (the threat of violence, of course, everywhere). Barnes does wonderful work on the key scenes  a negotiation with Stalin, a meeting with a terrifying interrogator who misses the second session, having himself presumably vanished into Stalins death machine  the whole Kafka madhouse brought to life. The narration is plain, the horror still plainer.Barnes focuses on Shostakovichs rage against the do-gooders, the Western Communist sympathizers:Hed refused to meet Rolland, pretending to be ill. But Shaw was the worse of the two. Hunger in Russia? he had asked rhetorically. Nonsense, Ive been fed as well as anywhere in the world. And it was he who said, You wont frighten me with the word dictator.But he also rages against the anti-Communist sympathizers, those who believe they know what he is going through:Those who understood a little better, who supported you, and yet at the same time were disappointed in you. ... They wanted martyrs to prove the regimes wickedness. ... How many martyrs would it take to prove that the regime was truly, monstrously, carnivorously evil? More, always more. ... What they didnt understand, these self-nominated friends, was how similar they were to Power itself: However much you gave, they wanted more.And so the author, whose novels include The Sense of an Ending and Flauberts Parrot, creates the impression of a man with rage in every direction, and very little affection  a man from whom affection has been surgically removed by fear, and by self-loathing at his own submission to it.Its a powerful portrait, and readers will have to decide whether they think this is really Shostakovich. I felt that he emerged as a (strangled) hero, but wished that Barnes would explain a little less, and show a bit more. As Shostakovich travels to America, what he had not prepared himself for was that New York would turn out to be a place of the purest humiliation, and of moral shame. But this tidy synopsis blunts the ensuing scene: The composer Nicolas Nabokov grills him in front of everyone, forcing him to denounce Stravinsky, whom he deeply admires. Nabokov the comfortable exposer looks around the room as if expecting applause, while Shostakovich the exposed is powerless to do anything but stand and suffer. Shostakovich was a connoisseur of false triumph, and this cruel moment of vain truth crushing pathetic impotence fits and explains his music perfectly.Eventually, this book becomes a meditation on the role of art. Narrative recedes, and the prose becomes hypnotic, circling obsessions. Many observations are beautiful, while some raise eyebrows. We come to the topic of the Borodin Quartet, and how it supposedly had two versions of a piece of his: one strategic, for government consumption, and the other authentic, speaking truth to power. But Shostakovich the narrator says:It wasnt true  it couldnt be true  because you cannot lie in music. The Borodins could only play the Fourth Quartet in the way the composer intended. Music  good music, great music  had a hard, irreducible purity to it. It might be bitter and despairing and pessimistic, but it could never be cynical.The quote you cannot lie in music is not from Shostakovich but from Valentin Berlinsky, the cellist of the Borodin Quartet  a small lie concealed within the narrative-biographical fabric, speaking by proxy for the dead. And of course you can lie in music: Look at Mozarts Cos Fan Tutte, for instance, or even Verdis Falstaff or any number of comic operas that depend on pretense. Music is fantastic at lying, and virtuosic in irony. In Shostakovichs case, the problem is mind-bending; the music is an intentional lie, which you must perform somehow truthfully. The phrase the way the composer intended is dangerous: Composers intents often change, day to day or hour to hour.Since Shostakovichs story is well known and often told, Barness role here is less that of a novelist than of a musician: He is performing a canonical work, trying to give an Important Story a new life. He isnt aiming for a radical rewrite, but an interpretation, an act of devotion  as if Barnes himself has some personal connection in relation to the story, as if each artist shares in Shostakovichs guilt.In Barness novel, Shostakovich gradually descends into self-mockery, clinging to his music to save his reputation in some future time. One key element of Shostakovichs heroism is missing. Think of it: He is denounced in Pravda, he lives in fear for his own life, the life of his family, the lives of anyone who ever supported him or performed his music; he looks forward only to decades of cowering. In that impossible situation, he sits down and writes the Fifth Symphony, one of the greatest, most perfect works of the 20th century. He doesnt choke, he doesnt lose sight of his gifts  certainly one of the best narrative senses of any composer in history  even as he spends nights awake weeping, his nerves completely shot. He writes, and doesnt lose his voice. He toes the line of self-destruction without actually being destroyed. Barnes mostly sidesteps the difficult task of writing about Shostakovichs specifically musical accomplishments  perhaps understandable, but regrettable.His music is a tragedy, no question; but whose? It is tempting to wallow in the impossibility of Shostakovichs situation, and we should definitely empathize with the poor man, as Barnes has. But I recall vividly that when I first played the E minor Piano Trio and came to the slow movement opening, a series of loud chords, my chamber music teacher told me to think of each chord as a friend who is killed or marched off to a labor camp. At 20, I didnt have much experience of death or labor camps, with the possible exception of my summer data-entry job, and I blinked back at him, a bit alarmed. But I tried in my sheltered American way to put myself in that place, and the chords came out darker and more shattering, and I felt myself trying to understand a whole different world of experience, people subject to arbitrary Power. And so it is: Shostakovichs music reaches out to express a world, to give warning, to memorialize the pointlessly murdered. The gloom may be unremitting, but it is not selfish."}
{"text": "CHARLESTON, S.C.  The Charleston church where nine African-Americans were shot in what the police say were racially motivated killings has given $1.5 million in donations to family members of the victims.The Post and Courier of Charleston reported that Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church said it kept about $1.8 million in donations for building maintenance, an endowment and a scholarship fund.The money was donated to the church in the months after the shootings last June. Church leaders say that only $280,000 worth of donations were specified for the victims families, but that the church decided to add more than $1 million to those gifts.An additional $78,000 specified for the city of Charlestons Hope Fund will be sent there to be distributed, said Wilbur Johnson, the churchs lawyer.Some family members are upset that the church kept more than it gave to them.Its just sad how the church continues to disrespect the families, the Rev. Sharon Risher, whose 70-year-old mother, Ethel Lance, died in the shooting, told the newspaper.The Post and Courier reported that victims family members and survivors received certified mail last week with checks and form letters from the church.This sum represents the distribution to you of a percentage of the total amount of funds, calculated upon the basis of the number of immediate family members of the Emanuel nine victims and survivors, the form letter said.The letters did not provide details about how much money the church received or how it decided to divide the donations.There was nothing personal about it at all, Andy Savage, a lawyer who represents several victims families and Felicia Sanders and Polly Sheppard, two survivors, told the newspaper.Mr. Johnson, the lawyer for the church, told The Post and Courier that the church used roughly the same formula the city used to disburse the Hope Fund but also included additional family members in an effort to broaden the reach of the donations and in recognition of the churchs pastoral outreach.The Hope Fund formula divided 55 percent of donations equally among the nine victims beneficiaries, 25 percent among the five shooting survivors, 10 percent among children of those killed, 5 percent to education expenses and 5 percent to a special needs account, the newspaper said.There have been two distributions from the Hope Fund  the first for $2.5 million and the second for $600,000  and a third and smaller distribution is expected, the newspaper reported.Nine people were shot and killed on the evening of June 17, 2015, during a prayer service at Emanuel. The victims included the churchs senior pastor, Clementa C. Pinckney, who was also a South Carolina state senator.After the killings, thousands of contributions poured in from around the world, much of it going directly to the church. The city established the Hope Fund to help distribute contributions it received.The Post and Courier said that originally, Emanuel officials planned to send the donations to the Hope Fund. But city lawyers declined to accept the donations because of a pending lawsuit and other questions raised about the church leaderships handling of the donations.A judges order had prevented Emanuel from disbursing donations until a few weeks ago when a lawsuit against the church  brought by the husband of Cynthia Graham Hurd, another victim  was dismissed. Arthur Hurd filed the lawsuit last fall seeking an accounting of the donations after lawyers for the families accused the church of not being transparent, The Post and Courier said."}

Soon it will be chanted at Trumps rallies, painted on posters and deployed as a heckling epithet against the probable Democratic nominee. Trump is confident the name will stick, and hes usually right about these things.I feel it, its an instinct, Trump told me over the phone. He envisions Crooked Hillary as the latest triumph in a series, after Lyin Ted, Liddle Marco and Low Energy Jeb, the nicknames that he affixed to his vanquished Republican rivals, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Trump has a knack for coining just the right moniker, the perfectly dismissive and catchy thing. It works, it flows, Trump said, admiring his latest work.It was nice of Trump to talk to me, given that this is The New York Times, or as he calls us on Twitter, the Failing New York Times. To be more precise, actually, Trump wants me to include that not only is this the Failing New York Times, but also that the Failing New York Times should also be followed by the tagline one of the most dishonest newspapers anywhere in the world. This was becoming a mouthful, but Trump was not done. And then Ill go, its truly one of the great disasters. Its sad whats happened to the Failing New York Times. But again, it was nice of Trump to call.When I was writing about Trump last fall for this magazine (he did not specify whether The Times Magazine was also failing), I asked him if his campaign ever conducted focus groups. His face contracted into a smirk. I do focus groups, he said, pressing both of his thumbs to the front of his head, right here. He does not seek suggestions or spitball ideas with his staff, though sometimes hell test-drive a name at a campaign rally and see how it goes over. If he mentions say, the name Ted Cruz, and a Lyin Ted chant erupts, he smells victory. The whole place would be going Lyin Ted, Lyin Ted,  Trump says, thousands of people, 25,000 people.Once an opponent drops out of the race, Trump told me, his or her nickname dies, at least as far as hes concerned. He goes back to using the actual name, although he reserves the right to bring the nickname back if he ever feels disrespected. With Jeb, I just said hes a low-energy individual, but I dont mind talking about it now, Trump said. Jeb has said hes not going to the convention. You know, hes just a spoiled guy.Like Trump himself, these monikers have a tabloid-ready directness. They can feel almost old-fashioned, like the professional wrestling shows of days gone by. (When Trump kept calling Rubio Little Marco, I kept thinking of Little Louie.) No deep thought or nuance or hand-wringing goes into his coinages, which should come as no surprise. As he has demonstrated with his mastery of Twitter, punchiness is crucial to the Trump playbook. Spelling counts, however. It was important that Lyin Ted be rendered with an apostrophe (no G), and Liddle Marco with Ds.It matters, Trump said of the spellings. It matters as to the look and feel and touch.Not everyone can do this. On Friday, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee tried to brand Trump with the name Dangerous Donald. Lame effort, in my view (or sad! as the Donald would say). Trump could do much better. But after I hung up with Trump, I immediately regretted that I had not thought to ask him an obvious question: What would he call himself? Damn. I keep failing."}
{"text": "At least 120 prominent writers and artists from around the world have signed a letter sent to Egypts president urging him to release Ahmed Naji, an Egyptian author and journalist imprisoned for a novel deemed to have violated public morals.The letter, sent by PEN America, a group that promotes free expression, amplifies the international pressure on the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, over his increasingly harsh repression of writers and journalists.Mr. Sisis government has imprisoned an unprecedented number of journalists since he took power in 2013. His policy of intolerance toward views he dislikes recently aroused the ire of Egypts journalists union, which includes many who work for state-run news outlets.The PEN America letter was sent before the organizations annual Literary Gala in New York on May 16, when Mr. Naji will be honored in absentia with the groups annual Freedom to Write award.Mr. Naji, 30, has been a vocal critic of corruption under Mr. Sisis administration. He was charged last year with violating public morality provisions in the penal code for explicit references to sex and drug use in a novel, The Use of Life, and sentenced in February to two years in prison.In what clearly looked like a politically motivated prosecution, the courts ignored that Egyptian censors had approved the references. Moreover, critics of the morality provisions contend they violate protections of freedom of expression in Egypts 2014 Constitution.Writing is not a crime, reads the letter to Mr. Sisi, which was signed by a diverse list of literary and artistic figures including Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, J. M. Coetzee, Jessica Hagedorn, David Henry Hwang and Orhan Pamuk.The letter called the sentencing emblematic of the Egyptian governments deeply troubling crackdown on free expression.The Egyptian authorities have not commented on the letter, which PEN America planned to announce on Monday.Suzanne Nossel, the executive director of PEN America, said in a telephone interview that the organization had discussed the letter in advance with Mr. Najis lawyer and members of his family for advice on what the best approach would be.The organization has sent such letters before to other governments, seeking pardons for imprisoned writers. But in this case, Ms. Nossel said, Mr. Naji did not want a pardon that would have let his conviction stand.He wanted an amendment to the law under which he had been convicted, she said.PEN America has what Ms. Nossel described as a good record in helping pressure governments to free imprisoned writers and artists who receive the organizations annual award. Thirty-five of the 40 recipients who were incarcerated at the time they won were subsequently released.We cant say that its direct causation, but we certainly believe the attention and pressure makes a difference, and many of the award winners have told us that, Ms. Nossel said.PEN Americas 2015 award winner, Khadija Ismayilova, an Azerbaijani investigative reporter who exposed government corruption, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on charges of abuse of power and tax evasion.Although she is still imprisoned, the Azerbaijani authorities are feeling increased pressure over her case. On Tuesday, Ms. Ismayilova was awarded the annual World Press Freedom Prize by Unesco, the United Nations cultural heritage agency, in recognition of her outstanding contribution to press freedom in difficult circumstances."}

{"text": "When was the last time you heard a curmudgeonly adult complain that kids today have it easy?Results from this years National Poll on Childrens Health were released in April, suggesting that many adults  both parents and nonparents  think that children today are experiencing more stress, and worse mental health, than when they themselves were young.This is a striking reversal of the traditional dynamic, in which adults recall the hardships and dangers of the old days, and conclude that kids today have it easy, said Dr. MatthewM.Davis, a pediatrician who isdirector of the poll at C.S. Mott Childrens Hospital at the University of Michigan.Not that the curmudgeons have shut up. Everyone knows that first world, privileged kids today are cushioned, shielded, protected from the literal and figurative bumps and bruises of the real-world playground. Everyone gets a trophy. We monitor childrens social interactions and if someone says something harsh, we call it bullying and we intervene. Parents are helicopter parents (hover hover), or worse, snowplow parents (pushing all the obstacles out of their childrens way). Kids are overprotected, spoiled, entitled and lazy.And everyone knows, of course, that kids today are overscheduled, highly stressed, burdened by completely unrealistic and hypercompetitive parental expectations of all-around achievement and success at a prestigious college. Few get that all-important trophy because the odds are so incredibly poor. Parents are would-be tigers, entitled demanding perfectionists, kids are stressed, pushed past what they can do, and miserably aware that they arent measuring up.So our children arent turning out right because we are dangerously overprotective in our parenting or too strict and demanding. To sum up, everything you do is wrong.Can we really be getting it so wrong at both ends? Can we be this bad at it?Its time to put an end to the everything-you-do-is-wrong school of parent criticism, which puts us all in an impossible bind. You helped your kid with a difficult school assignment? You helicopter, you! You referred to the importance of your childs high school G.P.A.? You hyper-critical, prestige-minded stress machine! (Even back in the 1970s, my parents were known to do both things.)Parents also feel stressed by this perception that children are so stressed. There are some real challenges for parents today in terms of encouraging them to be protective while at the same time not be overprotective, Dr. Davis said. That can be a very hard balance for parents to strike and its also a hard balance for communities to find.Dr. Kenneth Ginsburg, a pediatrician specializing in adolescent medicine at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia drew a specific connection between the apparent extremes of what he called self-esteem parenting and the high stress and anxiety of children who feel the weight of parental expectations. The problem, he said, is that if we praise children for being smart, they may become anxious about losing that label, and therefore less likely to take on hard tasks.But parents can help children become more willing to work hard, more perseverant, even more creative, he said. We have this enormous amount of research on what kind of parenting produces the best effect.The model that Dr. Ginsburg has put forward in his book, Raising Kids to Thrive: Balancing Love With Expectations and Protection With Trust, published through the American Academy of Pediatrics, is what he calls lighthouse parenting.You should look down at the rocks and make sure they never crash against them, and prepare them to ride the waves.This is the style of parenting described as authoritative, often contrasted with the extremes of permissive parenting and authoritarian parenting, and there is a lot of research to back it up. The authoritative or balanced parent essentially says, I love you so much but Im your daddy, Im not your friend, Dr. Ginsburg said, Im going to give you lots of opportunity to grow, a deep sense of connection so that youre going to be firmly rooted. Im going to give you lots of opportunity to make mistakes. But when something comes down to safety or morality, youre going to do what I say because I know best.I hope I have my lighthouse days, when I get the balance right. I know I also have my tiger days and my helicopter days, and for all I know, my free-range moments and my snowplow episodes, maybe in rapid succession. Everything I did when my kids were growing up was probably wrong, except when it was right.As parents, we all make decision after decision after decision  stand back and let a kid take a chance or interfere. Watch a kid struggle or offer help; encourage perseverance or say its O.K. to quit sometimes. Sympathize and reprove, console or tell them to suck it up. And the balance changes with the particular kid involved, but also with the day of the week and the month of the year.Except for the crazy people (and yes, there have to be some crazy people, or what would be the dirty fun of P.T.A. meetings and open school nights), most parents are somewhere in the middle, trying our best, getting it right sometimes, getting it wrong sometimes, and often unsure, especially as our children get older, whether today is a right day or a wrong day.When my oldest child was born and my husband was feeling swamped by the (predictable and appropriate) terror of this new responsibility and all the decisions to be made, my own father very kindly told him to stop worrying. There was no one thing that we would do or not do that would matter all that much, no individual decision or speech or act, he said.Our childwould understand who we were byeverything we did and how we lived, our tones, our values, our random eccentricities, not just by what we said parent-to-child, but by how we lived in the world. Eventually, our son would know us better than we knew ourselves.And somehow, that was a comforting thought, that parenting was not something we could purposefully decide, that it was who we were and how we lived that would inevitably constitute the family environment that would shape our child.Related:Interested in more Well Family?

Our most recent suggestions also appear below. To receive our guide straight to your inbox, sign up here.Finale season is here! A few shows have already ended, but this week Fox and ABC get in on the game, too. The end of the network season used to mean the start of all reruns, all the time. But between cable and streaming, year-round programming is more robust than ever. Hallelujah.Amid the finales, theres also a knockout episode of The Americans. I have a theory that The Americans is TV for TV obsessives  the more complex dramas youve watched, the more youll appreciate what the show is pulling off.Id love to know what shows you feel like you missed the boat on. I put off watching Bates Motel and then somehow four seasons went by, and now it feels a little late to join the party. Let us know what show slipped through the cracks: Email watching@nytimes.com, or tweet us at @Watching. Have a great week.The Americans has become the most arresting, vital drama on TV  fascinating and beautiful, and somehow getting better and better in its current fourth season. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, the mother and father of a normal American family in 1983. Except that theyre actually Soviet spies, and they wear various disguises and participate in long-term cons to gather intelligence.The spycraft is interesting in its own right, but the show is much more about marriage and parenthood, and the impossibility of knowing who anyone really is. Episodes that weave in actual culture and pop culture tend to be especially resonant, and this weeks episode, The Day After  a reference to the TV movie about nuclear war  is particularly so. And as often as The Americans is shocking and as strong as the espionage plotting can be, what I appreciate most is the shows refusal to engage in twists. What the show presents as true is true; many of the characters engage in profound, spirit-crushing deceit, but the audience never feels lied to. Theres no rewatching old episodes in a new light now that something has been revealed.Heres how to catch up: Seasons 1-3 are on Amazon Prime, and Season 4 is available to purchase individually on Amazon and iTunes, but is free on several cable OnDemand packages. Yes, you need to watch all of it, not only because its so terrific (it really is!) but also because the show is very methodical: Characters reappear after long stretches away, ideas germinate for several episodes and consequences are not always immediate.The Americans can be very violent, and it occasionally includes torture, though its not gratuitous. Watch more than four episodes at a time and youll start feeling like a sad monster. Season 1 is good, but Season 2 is when things really launch. (Wednesdays, 10 p.m., FX) New Girl, Grandfathered, The Grinder, Tuesday, starting at 8:00 p.m., Fox. New Girl (which is showing two episodes) has been renewed for another season, but Grandfathered and The Grinder are still waiting. Both are on the bubble, but get your viewing in while you can, just in case. The Big Bang Theory, Thursday, 8 p.m., CBS Scandal, Thursday, 9 p.m., ABC The Amazing Race, Friday, 8 p.m., CBS The Vampire Diaries, Friday, 8 p.m., The CW Once Upon a Time, Sunday, 7 p.m., ABC Last Man on Earth, Sunday, 9:30 p.m., Fox Quantico, Sunday, 10 p.m., ABCBotched (Tuesday, 9 p.m., E!) returns for a third season this week, but dont write it off with its crasser and sadder brethren. Its oddly comforting and is the rare show where people in legitimate dire straits get actual help. Dont get back-alley discount plastic surgery in Tijuana! Agh!Also this week, the series premiere of Chelsea (Wednesday, 12:01 a.m., Netflix), Chelsea Handlers new streaming talk show.Finally, the lovable and affirming Steven Universe (Thursday, 7 p.m., Cartoon Network) is back with new episodes, starting with Super Watermelon Island, which kicks off with one of the most enchanting dream sequences in living memory.The third season of Peaky Blinders premieres May 31 on Netflix. That gives you just enough time to watch the first two seasons, which are only six episodes each. Cillian Murphy stars as a crime boss in 1920s Birmingham, where vile behavior abounds.Game of Thrones This weeks episode was a talky one, Jeremy Egner writes. The episodes lone bit of action occurred in the past, but it was a big one: Bran vision-quested his way back to his fathers swordfight with the legendary Arthur Dayne. For a spoiler-filled explanation about why that scene was so important, read this piece over at Vulture.Outlander  Even when Ive disagreed with Claires decisions in the past I have found it almost impossible to not get swept up in her passion and at the very least understand the thoughts behind her actions, Angelica Jade Bastin writes. But for the first time there is something inauthentic to how certain events play out.Veep  After Selina sends an ill-advised tweet, things get bad with China. This is how international incidents get started, apparently, Jen Chaney writes. Not with a bang or even a security breach, but with a direct message accidentally made public.Silicon Valley  The writers of Silicon Valley have a special talent for engineering elaborate systems for the sake of a good running joke, Scott Tobias writes of this Oceans Eleven-spoofing episode.Fear the Walking Dead I know from reading your comments that a lot of you feel cheated, E.A. Hanks writes about the hopes of many viewers that this series would take a wider view of the zombie apocalypse as opposed to, like The Walking Dead, focusing on one small group of survivors.Captain America: Civil War made an estimated $181 million in North America this weekend, so its safe to assume that many of you saw it. Still, some of you havent. So well be vague when pointing to some of the more interesting pieces about the film.The Hollywood Reporter has an informative look at that thing with the dad and how it happened in the comics.Vanity Fair is not very enthusiastic about that thing that happens between that man and that woman.Vox writes about the films post-credits scenes  the one with that important guy in that place and then the second one with that new guy in his house.Yahoo asks the screenwriters about five key moments.

{"text": "Truth to tell, sometimes I dont follow my own advice, and when I suffer the consequences, I rediscover why I offer it. Ive long recommended drinking plenty of water, perhaps a glass with every meal and another glass or two between meals. If not plain water, which is best, then coffee or tea without sugar (but not alcoholic or sugary drinks) will do.I dined out recently after an especially active day that included about five miles of walking, 40 minutes of lap swimming and a 90-minute museum visit. I drank only half a glass of water and no other beverage with my meal.It did seem odd that I had no need to use the facilities afterward, not even after a long trip home. But I didnt focus on why until the next day when, after a fitful night, I awoke exhausted, did another long walk and swim, and cycled to an appointment four miles away. I arrived parched, begging for water. After downing about 12 ounces, I was a new person. I no longer felt like a lead balloon.It seems mild dehydration was my problem, and the experience prompted me to take a closer look at the bodys need for water under a variety of circumstances.Although millions of Americans carry water bottles wherever they go and beverage companies like Coke and Pepsi would have you believe that every life can be improved by the drinks they sell, the truth is serious dehydration is not common among ordinary healthy people. But there are exceptions, and they include people like me in the Medicare generation, athletes who participate in particularly challenging events like marathons, and infants and small children with serious diarrhea.Lets start with some facts. Water is the single most important substance we consume. You can survive for about two months without food, but you would die in about seven days without water. Water makes up about 75 percent of an infants weight and 55 percent of an older persons weight.Human cells simply dont function without water, and the body has evolved a finely tuned, complex system for making sure it has the water it needs under a wide range of conditions. In most cases, thirst is a reliable signal that more water is needed. A main job of the kidneys is to excrete just enough water to keep cells properly hydrated. However, contrary to myth, dark urine does not necessarily mean youre dehydrated. Urine can be discolored by foods like asparagus, blackberries and beets.Another popular myth: To moisturize skin, prevent wrinkles and produce a glowing complexion, you need to drink eight glasses of water a day. Drinking extra water doesnt improve skin in people who are otherwise well hydrated. Better to use an emollient moisturizer to counter dry skin.Good hydration definitely protects against kidney stones, and there is evidence that it counters constipation and exercise-induced asthma. It may also help protect against vascular diseases, like stroke, an elevated heart rate or sudden drop in blood pressure and is especially important for people with diabetes.Despite the vital importance of water, there are relatively few good studies of how much is needed, by whom and under what circumstances, according to Barry M. Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We do not truly understand how hydration affects health and well-being, even the impact of water intakes on chronic diseases, he and his colleagues wrote in Nutrition Reviews.Nearly all the funding of water research has been provided by industry, Dr. Popkin said in an interview, referring to companies that sell all manner of beverages, including bottled water. And most of the research on water has been organ-specific, done by people studying the kidneys or lungs. Whole body systems havent been well studied.There are no formal guidelines on how much water people need each day. The amount is affected by what people eat, their weight and activity level and even the environment in which they live.The Institute of Medicine, which issues recommendations on the amounts of nutrients we need, states that an adequate intake of water ranges from 700 milliliters (about three cups) a day for newborns to 3.8 liters (16 cups) for lactating women. Still, the institute concluded that individuals can be adequately hydrated at levels below as well as above the adequate intakes provided.Furthermore, the institute stated that all kinds of liquids can contribute to a persons total water needs, including beverages like tea, coffee, juices, sodas and drinking water, as well as the moisture contained in foods like fruits, vegetables, soups and even meats. In fact, the institute estimates that the moisture in food accounts for about 20 percent of a typical persons water intake.Although the institute included juices and sodas as potential sources of hydration, these often sugar-laden beverages have become a serious nutritional problem in recent decades. The entire increase in fluid intake in the United States, from 79 ounces a day in 1989 to 100 ounces in 2002, came from caloric beverages, Dr. Popkin and colleagues reported. Studies have shown that people who drink these extra calories dont compensate by consuming commensurately fewer calories from food, which has contributed mightily to the ballooning waistlines of Americans.To be sure, its important for athletes to drink plenty of water, especially when high levels of activity, heat and humidity result in excessive sweating. But overdoing hydration has its own risks; marathon runners and other athletes have died after drinking more water than the kidneys are capable of processing in a timely manner, leading to swollen cells and dangerously low blood levels of sodium and other electrolytes.At the same time, inadequate hydration can have debilitating effects. Studies by Lawrence B. Armstrong and colleagues at the University of Connecticuts Human Performance Laboratory showed that dehydration can adversely affect vigilance, concentration, reaction time, learning, memory, mood and reasoning and can cause headaches, fatigue and anxiety.Older people, especially the frail elderly, are among those at greatest risk of poor hydration, Dr. Popkin noted. The mechanism of thirst becomes less effective with age, and many older people cut back on how much they drink to limit how often they need to get to a bathroom.Theres a big problem with older people falling during the night and breaking bones when they get up to go to the bathroom, Dr. Popkin said. Many dont drink because theyre afraid to fall, but instead they may die of the effects of dehydration.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "The most important political event of recent weeks was not the emergence of Donald J. Trump as the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party but the election of Sadiq Khan, the Muslim son of a London bus driver, as mayor of London.Trump has not won any kind of political office yet, but Khan, the Labour Party candidate, crushed Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative, to take charge of one of the worlds great cities, a vibrant metropolis where every tongue is heard. In his victory, a triumph over the slurs that tried to tie him to Islamist extremism, Khan stood up for openness against isolationism, integration against confrontation, opportunity for all against racism and misogyny. He was the anti-Trump.Before the election, Khan told my colleague Stephen Castle, Im a Londoner, Im a European, Im British, Im English, Im of Islamic faith, of Asian origin, of Pakistani heritage, a dad, a husband.The world of the 21st century is going to be shaped by such elided, many-faceted identities and by the booming cities that celebrate diversity, not by some bullying, brash, bigoted, America first white dude who wants to build walls.It is worth noting that under the ban on Muslim noncitizens entering the country that Trump proposes, Khan would not be allowed to visit the United States. To use one of Trumps favorite phrases, this would be a complete and total disaster. It would make America a foul mockery in the eyes of a world already aghast at the Republican candidates rise.Khans election is important because it gives the lie to the facile trope that Europe is being taken over by jihadi Islamists. It underscores the fact that terrorist acts hide a million quiet success stories among European Muslim communities. One of seven children of a Pakistani immigrant family, Khan grew up in public housing and went on to become a human rights lawyer and government minister. He won more than 1.3 million votes in the London election, a personal mandate unsurpassed by any politician in British history.His election is important because the most effective voices against Islamist terrorism come from Muslims, and Khan has been prepared to speak out. After the Paris attacks last year, he said in a speech that Muslims had a special role to play in countering the terrorism, not because we are more responsible than others, as some have wrongly claimed, but because we can be more effective at tackling extremism than anyone else.Khan has also reached out to Britains Jewish community, vigorously disavowing the creeping anti-Semitism in Labour ranks that last month saw Ken Livingstone, a former London mayor, suspended from the party.As George Eaton observed in The New Statesman: Khan will be a figure of global significance. His election is a rebuke to extremists of all stripes, from Donald Trump to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, who assert that religions cannot peacefully coexist.Trump as a politician is a product of American fear and anger above all. In the past several weeks, a U.C. Berkeley student has been escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight because he was heard speaking Arabic, and an olive-skinned, curly haired Italian Ivy League economist was taken off an American Airlines flight because he was spotted scribbling mathematical calculations that his seatmate found suspicious.Trump  described to me by Norm Ornstein, the political scientist, as the most insecure and ego-driven person in the country  is the mouthpiece of this frightened America that sees threats everywhere (even in an Italian mathematician).When Trump declares, America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration, the rest of the world hears an angry nation flexing its muscles.Khans rise, by contrast, is a story of victory over the fears engendered by 9/11. His victory is a rebuke to Osama bin Laden, the Islamic State, jihadi ideology of every stripe  and to the hatemongering politicians like Trump who choose to play the Muslim-equals-danger game. Khan has argued that greater integration is essential and too many British Muslims grow up without really knowing anyone from a different background.Sigmund Freud wrote, It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct. Donald Trump has written: I have learned to listen and trust my gut. Its one of my most valued counselors. He recently said, We must, as a nation, be more unpredictable.Right.Put together an egotist, a bully, immense power and a taste for gut-driven unpredictability and you have a dangerous brew that could put civilization at risk. Those small fingers would have access to the nuclear codes if Trump was elected.In this context, Sadiq Khans victory is reassuring because he represents currents in the world  toward global identity and integration  that will prove stronger over time than the tribalism and nativism of Trump."}
{"text": "More than one million desperate refugees fled to Europe last year, redefining the meaning of being down and out and in the search for a place where one might live in relative safety. This context of human suffering made the ruling last week by Italys highest appeals court ring all the more with mercy in the case of a hungry Ukrainian immigrant facing jail time for stealing $4.70 worth of sausage and cheese in a Genoa supermarket.He took possession of that small amount of food in the face of the immediate and essential need for nourishment, acting therefore in a state of need, the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled, finding that the meal purloined by Roman Ostriakov, a destitute homeless man, does not constitute a crime.No one knows for certain what the ruling might trigger as a precedent. But the news of Mr. Ostriakovs victory after a three-year court fight quickly spread worldwide as a bit of delight in the days welter of assorted sufferings. Italians, who have endured high rates of poverty and unemployment, could be encouraged that court scholars cited an underlining legal doctrine  Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur, which means, No one is expected to do the impossible.Commentators immediately cited Jean Valjean, the Victor Hugo character who was sent to prison for stealing a loaf of bread, and of whom Hugo wrote: There is a point at which the unfortunate and the infamous are associated and confounded in a single word, a fatal word, Les Misrables.Pope Francis has described the misery of being poor in the modern world: These people stand at the edges of our great avenues, in our streets, in deafening anonymity. They become part of an urban landscape which is more and more taken for granted, in our eyes, and especially in our hearts. He warns: The coexistence of wealth and poverty is a scandal, it is a disgrace for humanity.The Italian court ruling comes perfectly timed for Francis, who has invited thousands of homeless and impoverished people to Rome in November to dramatize global poverty at the European Festival of Joy and Mercy. Theres no word yet whether Roman Ostriakov might be invited."}

Thats important when you are retrieving a 17th-century vase, as it did on its first dive, at the end of April.Dr. Khatib, who specializes in robots in humanoid form, said no other diving robot has arms, elbows hands and vision like OceanOne.We have wonderful underwater vehicles for sure, he said. Progress in robotic mobility has been amazing. They can see, they can map, they can discover new shipwrecks. But they cannot do.He designed OceanOne to meet the needs of researchers studying deep coral reefs in the Red Sea. The robot can go deeper than human divers can go comfortably and into more dangerous spots. It works well for archaeology, too; thus its first dive was to a shipwreck.The humanoid form, Dr. Khatib said, enables fine control of grasping movements, and makes it intuitive for a person to operate. We are creating your avatar, he said.Humans working alongside OceanOne tend to relate to it almost as if it were a dive buddy, Dr. Khatib said. And the operator is able to communicate with those divers by using hand signs.OceanOne does lack two human attributes  legs. Like a merman or mermaid, its aft end is devoted to propulsion, although it uses thrusters rather than a tail."}
{"text": "The future is dire, the past a blur and the present heartbroken yet hinting at possibilities on Radioheads A Moon Shaped Pool, its ninth studio album and perhaps its darkest statement  though the one with the bands most pastoral surface.Radiohead worries throughout the album: about environmental devastation, about mass thoughtlessness, about love gone cold, about finding some way forward. Youve really messed up everything, Thom Yorke sings in Ful Stop, one of the albums few up-tempo songs, though it uses its insistent beat for jitters, not pleasurable motion.On this album, grim tidings arrive amid gorgeous backdrops: gentle pianos and acoustic guitars reinforced by a string orchestra. Multilayered tinklings and murmurings give the music a subliminally shimmering aura. But this is Radiohead, whose beauty is always laced with dread; for the most part, A Moon Shaped Pool is an album of nightmare lullabies. In Daydreaming, a somber, undulating piano waltz, Mr. Yorke croons, Beyond the point of no return/and its too late, the damage is done. The albums opening track, Burn the Witch, is a spiral of tension, cryptically portraying a society ignoring its own witch hunts as a clattery, insistent string arrangement ratchets up the dissonance and agitation.Throughout the album, the state of the world and the state of the singers heart shade into one another. When I see you messing me around, I dont want to know, Mr. Yorke sings in Identikit, and whether hes thinking about personal, political or corporate betrayal  or just about the way facial features can be interchanged and messed around with in a police Identi-Kit  is unclear, even after the Beatles-tinged chorus arrives: Broken hearts make it rain.In Present Tense, a bittersweet bossa nova akin to past Radiohead songs like Knives Out and House of Cards, Mr. Yorke sings, As my world comes crashing down/Ill be dancing, freaking out and wonders, Will all this love have been in vain?Mr. Yorke, 47, and his partner of 23 years, Rachel Owen, separated last year, releasing a statement that the parting was perfectly amicable; at the end of Daydreaming, Mr. Yorkes voice is played in reverse, repeating Half my life. But the songs shouldnt be reduced to autobiography. Radiohead, and Mr. Yorke on his own, have been playing some of the albums material  Identikit, Present Tense and True Love Waits  onstage for years as they painstakingly tinkered with them in the studio. Burn the Witch has been hinted at for more than a decade.Every hiss and creak on the album has probably been weighed and considered. A Moon Shaped Pool was five years in the making, a little longer than the four-year gaps between Hail to the Thief (2003), In Rainbows (2007) and The King of Limbs (2011). Thats how Radiohead works now, in fits and starts between Mr. Yorkes side projects (Atoms for Peace, appearances at protests and benefit concerts) and the guitarist Jonny Greenwoods soundtracks (among them There Will Be Blood, The Master and Inherent Vice) and collaborations (such as Junun, with the composer Shye Ben Tzur).The songs thrive on their coalition, melding Mr. Yorkes troubled words and aching melodies with Mr. Greenwoods textural mastery (including, presumably, the string arrangements) and the self-effacing contributions of the rest of the band. Both Mr. Yorke and Mr. Greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners, lovers of melody and explorers of idioms, makers of puzzles who dont shy away from emotion.One thing Radiohead no longer worries about is digital technology. During the 1990s, when Radiohead made OK Computer, its songs warned desperately about technologys incursions on individuality. But in Radioheads music now, technology is just a tool, ubiquitous and unremarkable, not the center of attention. A Moon Shaped Pool uses the studio extensively, but reveals the human activity there. Regardless of how it was assembled, the sound of the album is largely acoustic and analog: a little hazy, a little noisy, avoiding the metronomic. Daydreaming opens with that most analog of effects, a wavering pitch like a tape slipping off-speed. The technology just helps capture and loop the tones of acoustic guitars, keyboards, percussion and voices, whether or not theyre fed through analog distortion gadgets; its as amoral as a microphone or an amplifier. And the music sounds unplugged even where its obviously programmed.The results often hark back to the late 1960s; in a way, A Moon Shaped Pool is Radioheads psych-folk album. The Numbers, which Radiohead fans have previously known as Silent Spring, counsels, We are of the earth/to her we do return, and comes as close as Radiohead gets to a call to arms: Well take back what is ours, it insists. The production hints at Buffalo Springfields Expecting to Fly, with stately swells of guitar and gusts of strings. Desert Island Disk recalls the jazz-tinged folk experiments of Pentangle and the electronic phantasms of early Tim Buckley as Mr. Yorke envisions the wind rushing round my open heart, an open ravine. Yet its the rare song on the album that offers a glimpse of hope  a feeling of being totally alive, totally released. Glass Eyes starts as the bleakest of ballads, with minor piano chords drifting into the fog as the singer arrives in a frightening unknown town and finds, perhaps, an escape. A path trails off and heads down the mountain, he sings. I dont know where it leads/I dont really care.The album ends with True Love Waits, a love song Radiohead wrote in the 1990s and first recorded on a 2001 live EP, I Might Be Wrong, with Mr. Yorke simply strumming and singing alone, building up to the songs pleading refrain, Dont leave, dont leave. Two decades later, its studio version testifies to what Radioheads patient perfectionism can achieve. Instead of guitar chords, it starts with four repeating piano notes, a chord dissected and laid bare. The same piano figure sketches the songs other chords through the first verse. Gradually, more pianos are overdubbed: in rippling loops, low resonant tones and repeated chords, not so much filling out the arrangement as emanating alongside it, somewhere between harmonious and oblivious. Its a world that exists outside one mans longings, and wont be eclipsed by them."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is expected to return to the Capitol this week, the last of four Republican senators battered and beaten by Donald J. Trump to trudge back to the world of meetings over cafeteria cod and roll call votes to name the national mammal.But Mr. Cruzs return is more fraught with curiosity than those of the other three, Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida. He made it the furthest, winning 10 states and coming tantalizingly close to pushing Mr. Trump to a contested convention, only to drop out on the same day the billionaire developer suggested that Mr. Cruzs father had conspired with Lee Harvey Oswald.The partys presumptive nominee had also insulted Mr. Cruzs wife, baselessly alluded to extramarital affairs and labeled him Lyin Ted.Now the man who helped create an outsider movement in national politics, only to have it eat him alive after his rival co-opted the idea, must decide which group among his fellow lawmakers to join. Will he stand with the hold-your-nose set, as Mr. Paul has done, and support Mr. Trump? Or join forces with Never Trump, as Senator Graham did on Friday, and publicly decline to get on board?Or will he take the route of Mr. Rubio, in effect giving a non-endorsement endorsement, saying he will support any Republican nominee, but not explicitly name Mr. Trump?I think all of us will be interested to see what position Senator Cruz takes, said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who is more or less in the same place as Mr. Graham. After he pretty much excoriated Trump on the final day of his campaign, it would be quite a turnabout if he were to support him now.Millions of voters are watching, but for now, he wont say. Mr. Cruz is currently scheduled to be back in D.C. next week, and thats as much detail as were sharing right now, his spokesman Phil Novack said on Friday.The Senate has long been the cradle of presidential ambition, with each of the 100 senators possessed of the capacity to look in the mirror and see the next president of the United States. But those dreams are so rarely realized that Barack Obama was the first to ascend directly from the Senate to the White House since John F. Kennedy.Mr. Cruzs return nearly coincides with the arrival of Mr. Trump, who plans to visit Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other House Republicans on Thursday with the goal of unifying the party. Mr. Ryan said last week that he was not ready to give Mr. Trump his support.It is a division Mr. Cruz helped create, by pressing congressional Republicans to defy party leaders and their colleagues to shut down the government and repeatedly hold up basic legislation, giving him the distinction of being the least popular member of one of the worlds most exclusive clubs.But outside the noise and theatrics of the campaign, Mr. Cruz also finds himself at a potential turning point in his Senate career, both as a returning failed presidential candidate and as an unpopular firebrand who has been most comfortable as a thorn, rather than partner, to other Republicans.The Senate has a rich history of members whose run for president failed but who came back to effective legislative careers.From Henry Clay, who ran for president three times in the 1800s, to Hubert Humphrey, who narrowly lost to Richard Nixon in 1968, to Edward M. Kennedy, one of the greatest bipartisan lawmakers of all time, to John McCain, who was defeated by Barack Obama in 2008 and is now an effective chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also-rans can find their Senate home a great refuge.They remember what they liked about the Senate, said Donald A. Ritchie, a historian emeritus of the Senate. The fact is United States senators are very influential and powerful people in their own right. Those who come back and are not running again or not at the end of their term hunker down in committee assignments and hopefully have learned a lot that can translate into legislation.The Senates clubbiness and customs can also make for a pleasant landing after a dispiriting defeat. The Senate can be a forgiving place for those coming back from a run for president, said Jim Manley, a former senior communications aide to Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. You still have staffers at your beck and call, and everyone still opens the door for you.At the same time, even lawmakers who wore their antagonism of leaders with honor can evolve into statesmen in the Senate. This was the case with Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania  now best known for his bipartisan efforts at a gun safety law  and Mr. Flake, who used to irritate House leaders and is now considered one of the most thoughtful members of the Senate.Toomey and Flake  when confronted with the way the place works, they moderated, said James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. They changed the institution a little bit, but more the institutions changed them. In the case of Mr. Toomey, who is up for re-election, with Trump at the top of the ticket he has to focus on his role in the Senate, Mr. Thurber said.Mr. Graham returned to the Senate being, well, Lindsey Graham. He quips, he votes, he goes on television and is funny. Eating a taco is probably not going to fix the problems that we have with Hispanics, he told CNNs Dana Bash last week, referring to Mr. Trumps photo on Twitter of himself with a taco bowl. I think embracing Donald Trump is embracing demographic death.Mr. Rubio has become more senatorial in a classic sense than he had been in the last two years, going to the floor of the Senate to fight for money to combat the Zika virus, and traveling to the Middle East.Marco always believed his purpose in the Senate was to get things done, said Alex Conant, his former spokesman. Thats why he joined the immigration reform effort and spent so much time on foreign policy. When the campaign ended, it was easy for him to get back to work in the Senate.Mr. Pauls return has been decidedly different. He has mostly just walked around looking miserable.What Mr. Cruz will do is anyones guess. Right now he has been resting with his family, and no one seems to have heard from him.The Senate can change you, Mr. Manley said, but if you want to be an effective legislator, 60 votes are key and bipartisanship is necessary if you want to get anything done. Senator Cruz demonstrated zero desire to work with his colleagues before he went on the campaign trail, and I doubt very much he will change when he gets back. And that is a problem the Senate does not need right now."}
{"text": "The Clinton campaign is returning to the airwaves after a brief absence, buying roughly $175,000 worth of television advertising in Kentucky to air in the next week, according to two media buyers tracking the reservations.The campaign has not made any new reservations or paid for advertising since Mrs. Clintons decisive victories in the Mid-Atlantic states on April 26.In Indiana, the campaign was outspent on advertising by Bernie Sanders by $1.6 million to zero. Mrs. Clinton also lost that contest.With Mr. Sanders reiterating his pledge to fight for every remaining vote in every remaining state Monday morning at a campaign rally in Atlantic City, and Donald J.

{"text": "DALLAS  Heavy metal and hip-hop music blasted through American Airlines Center on Saturday during Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinal series between the St. Louis Blues and the Dallas Stars. But if you think country songs by Shania Twain would be too genteel for the playlist of the D.J. known as Grubes, then you do not know these smitten Stars, who gave her some credit for their overtime victory in Game 4.Still, a question lingered. Could her music keep them winning?Watching the game with the score tied at 1-1 in the first period, Tom Gaglardi, the Stars owner, said of Twain: Im proud of her. Shes a good Canadian and a great artist.Gaglardi, who is from Vancouver, added of the Stars, They listen to country music more often than not in the locker room and practice facility.Even among country stars, though, Twain holds a special place in the Stars hearts.Before Game 4 on Thursday, members of the Dallas news media waiting to speak to the team were held at bay by center Jason Spezza until the end of Twains song Youre Still the One, The Dallas Morning News reported. The teams captain, Jamie Benn, pumped up the volume.Did the lyrics remind the Stars of the teams only Stanley Cup championship, in 1999? Looks like we made it/Look how far weve come, my baby/We mightve took the long way/We knew wed get there someday.When the Stars beat the Blues, 3-2, in overtime of Thursdays game, Spezza suggested Twain had had an influence. Amalie Benjamin of NHL.com wrote on Twitter, First thing Jason Spezza said to me when I walked in the Stars room: Shania. Grin.Alerted to her apparent impact on the Stars tying the series, Twain responded on Twitter. Heard @dallasstars have amazing taste in pre game music, she wrote.  Must have helped them to the win?! Incredible game guys!Benn then responded, writing that we only listen to the best!Defenseman Jason Demers added: OMG shania knows who we are!!!Sports teams sometimes cannot resist a connection to a celebrity, including ownership by one (as with Jay Zs former sliver of a stake in the Nets). This season, the Florida Panthers inexplicably began awarding a Spacey in Space hoodie to the most valuable player of each game. The actor Kevin Spacey learned of the ritual and began exchanging messages on Twitter with the players. When he attended a game, the team handed out Spacey Faceys  cardboard cutouts of his head.Twain did not show up on Saturday, and maybe she should have. Her music was playing to the full arena. But Youre Still the One (used for the kiss cam) and Man! I Feel Like a Woman! did not have a victorious effect. Dallas lost, 4-1.There were too many missed scoring opportunities  the Stars lacked what Coach Lindy Ruff called puck luck.Afterward, the Stars locker room was subdued as players quietly explained their losing effort and discussed whether they could win the next two games to move into the conference finals. Twains music was by then a memory of inspiration past.But it offered a moment of jest for Blues Coach Ken Hitchcock. Asked if he knew about the Twain-Stars musical romance and if he was able to counter it, he instead responded that he was also inspired by Twain.So whats the difference? he said, smiling. Really inspired. So were even.The Blues later posted on Twitter a picture of Twain in a Blues jersey, accompanied by the message Its not too late, @ShaniaTwain  come on over!The Twain incident would probably not have mattered, or occurred, if the Stars were not in the midst of a revival. The team had been weakened by the debt woes of the former owner Tom Hicks; in 2011, Gaglardi acquired the team through bankruptcy court, the same route Hicks had taken in selling the Texas Rangers a year earlier.We had become somewhat irrelevant in the market, Gaglardi said. Our season-ticket base had hit the lowest point ever, and we had to rebuild it. Thats not easy. Its one ticket, one fan at a time. Theres no magic to it.Now, he said, the season ticket base has risen to between 13,000 and 14,000.Gaglardi, a large man wearing an untucked pinstriped shirt, was sitting on a deep sofa in his luxury suite filled with guests, mainly local business executives.Im a normal Canadian, he said. I grew up with hockey. Ive played it since Im 5 years old. My kids play. I coach back home. Its just a wonderful sport. Several years ago, when the Canucks came on the market, Im me, so I tried to buy them, but I ended up with a great franchise here.How great may depend on if the team can start a comeback in St. Louis on Monday night.And if Twains musical magic returns."}
{"text": "Thank heavens Gregor Mendel was a lousy priest. Had he shown even the faintest aptitude for oratory or ministering to the poor, he might never have determined the basic laws of heredity. But bumbling he was, and he made a rotten university student to boot; his failures drove him straight to his room, where he bred mice in secret. The experiment scandalized his superiors.A monk coaxing mice to mate to understand heredity was a little too risqu, even for the Augustinians, writes Siddhartha Mukherjee in The Gene: An Intimate History. So Mendel switched  auspiciously, historically  to pea plants. The abbot in charge, writes the author, acquiesced this time, giving peas a chance.Love Dr. Mukherjee, love his puns. Theyre everywhere. I warn you now.It is Dr. Mukherjees curse  or blessing, assuming hes a glass-half-full sort of fellow  to have to follow in his own mammoth footsteps. The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, his dazzling 2010 debut, won the Pulitzer and almost every other species of literary award; it became a three-part series on PBS; Time magazine deemed it one of the 100 most influential books written in the English language since 1923.In his acknowledgments to The Gene, Dr. Mukherjee, a researcher and cancer specialist, confesses that he once feared his first book would also be his last  that Emperor had sapped all my stories, confiscated my passports and placed a lien on my future as a writer.The solution, he eventually realized, was to tell the story of the gene. It is his debuts natural prequel, a tale of normalcy before it tips into malignancy.By the time The Gene is over, Dr. Mukherjee has covered Mendel and his peas, Darwin and his finches. Hes taken us on the quest of Watson, Crick and their many unsung compatriots to determine the stuff and structure of DNA. We learn about how genes were sequenced, cloned and variously altered, and about the race to map our complete set of DNA, or genome, which turns out to contain a stunning amount of filler material with no determined function.Many of the same qualities that made The Emperor of All Maladies so pleasurable are in full bloom in The Gene. The book is compassionate, tautly synthesized, packed with unfamiliar details about familiar people. (Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, used to rank the beauty of women on the street by using pinpricks on a card hidden in his pocket. Ick.)But there are also crucial differences. Cancer is the troll that scratches and thumps beneath the floorboards of our consciousness, if it hasnt already beaten its way into the room. The subject immediately commands our attention; its almost impossible to deny, and not to hear, the emotional clang of its appeal. In Dr. Mukherjees skilled hands, the story of this frightening disease became a page-turner. He explained its history, politics and cunning biological underpinnings; he traced the evolving and often gruesome logic underlying cancer treatment.And in the middle of it all, agonizing over treatment protocols and watching his patients struggle with tremendous existential and physical pain, was the author himself.There are far fewer psychological stakes in reading about the history of genetics. The Gene is more pedagogical than dramatic; as often as not, the stars of this story are molecules, not humans. Dr. Mukherjee still has a poignant personal connection to the material  mental illness has wrapped itself around his family tree like a stubborn vine, claiming two uncles and a cousin on his fathers side  but this book does not aim for the gut. It aims for the mind.So what does this mean? That there are many excursions deep into the marshes of biochemistry and cellular biology. Bring your waders. It gets dense in there. Dr. Mukherjee can write with great clarity about difficult genetic concepts  hes especially handy with metaphors  but the science gets increasingly complex, and it lasts for many pages. Even when the going is easy, readers should be prepared for parentheticals like this: i.e., ACT CCT GGG >ACU CCU GGG.Dr. Mukherjees explanations are sometimes so thorough they invite as many questions as they answer  from the most elementary (why is something that contains so many bases called deoxyribonucleic acid?) to the more esoteric (if, as he says in a Homeric footnote on Page 360, the Y chromosome is so unstable it might eventually disappear, will we still reproduce?)I do not mean to suggest that Dr. Mukherjee has neglected to attend to big questions or ideas in this work; they just get lesser billing than Id have liked. But any book about the history of something as elemental and miraculous as the gene is bound, at least indirectly, to tell the story of innovation itself. The Gene is filled with scientists who dreamed in breathtakingly lateral leaps.Erwin Schrdinger in particular was one visionary cat: In 1944, he hazarded a guess about the molecular nature of the gene and decided it had to be a strand of code scribbled along the chromosome  which pretty much sums up the essence of DNA.With each and every genetic discovery, a host of questions arose, both ethical and philosophical. What are the implications of cloning, of creating genetic hybrids, of gene editing? Is there any value in knowing about the existence of a slumbering, potentially lethal genetic mutation in your cells if nothing can be done about it? (Personally, I wish hed dedicated 50 pages to this question  itd have offered a potentially moving story line and a form of emotional engagement I badly craved.)Does the genome have anything to tell us about race, sexual identity, gender? Do these three-billion-plus base pairs connect, in any way, to what we think of as a self?Dr. Mukherjee answers these questions cautiously and compassionately, if at times too cursorily for my satisfaction. He notes, repeatedly, that for all we know about the genome, there is so very much we dont  it is a recipe, not a blueprint, as Richard Dawkins likes to say. Yes, sometimes one gene controls one specific trait; but often, dozens of genes do, and in ways we do not understand (or cannot even fully identify), and they interact mysteriously with the environment all along the way.But as research continues apace, we must entertain the sci-fi prospect of one day customizing ourselves and our children. For now, were burdened with more and more moral decisions to make as genetic tests become increasingly refined.If the history of the last century taught us the dangers of empowering governments to determine genetic fitness, Dr. Mukherjee writes  referring to Nazism, eugenics, every genocidal experiment involving social engineering  then the question that confronts our current era is what happens when the power devolves to the individual.But we are not apps. Dr. Mukherjee knows this, struggles with it. Is optimization really the point of life? Illness might progressively vanish, he writes, but so might identity."}
{"text": "William Schallert, a familiar presence on prime-time television for decades, notably as the long-suffering father and uncle to the identical cousins played by Patty Duke on the hit 1960s sitcom The Patty Duke Show, died on Sunday in Pacific Palisades, Calif. He was 93.His son Edwin confirmed the death.Mr. Schallerts career spanned generations and genres. Over more than 60 years he racked up scores of credits in episodic television as well as noteworthy performances in motion pictures, on the Off Broadway stage and as a voice-over artist.With his preternaturally mature, intelligent but (by Hollywood standards) unremarkable looks, he was cast almost from the beginning as an authority figure  a father or a teacher, a doctor or a scientist, a mayor or a judge. Most active from the 1950s through the 80s, Mr. Schallert remained seemingly unchanged in appearance and persona over time, and he was still working in his 90s, dismissing any thoughts of retirement.On television it sometimes seemed as if he was everywhere. A versatile character actor with a comforting presence, he was equally at home in comedies and dramas, with a rsum ranging from Leave It to Beaver, The Twilight Zone, Dr. Kildare and The Wild Wild West to Melrose Place, True Blood and Desperate Housewives.Before joining the ranks of harried sitcom fathers as Martin Lane on The Patty Duke Show (1963-66), he was the equally harried teacher Leander Pomfritt, bane of the title character, on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959-62). He also earned a permanent place in the hearts of Star Trek fans in 1967 when he played Nilz Baris, under secretary in charge of agricultural affairs for the United Federation of Planets, in The Trouble With Tribbles, often cited by fans and critics as one of the best episodes of the original Star Trek series.Never a leading man, Mr. Schallert was instead a high-caliber embodiment of the working actor.In an interview for this obituary in 2009, Mr. Schallert said he had never been particularly selective about the roles he played. Thats not the best way to build a career, he admitted, but I kept on doing it, and eventually it paid off.While the typical William Schallert character was focused and serious, he expressed particular affection for an atypical role: the wildly decrepit Admiral Hargrade, a recurring character on the spy spoof Get Smart (1967-70), who operated in a perpetual state of confusion. (He reminded me of my grandmother when she got dotty, Mr. Schallert said.)His film career, which began in 1947 with small roles in The Foxes of Harrow and Doctor Jim, was memorable at first for its kitsch value. He made his mark playing intense doctors and scientists in science-fiction fare like The Man From Planet X (1951), Gog (1954) and The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957). Years later, the director Joe Dante paid tribute to Mr. Schallerts cinematic roots by casting him in his valentine to 1950s schlock cinema, Matinee (1993), where he was seen in the film within the film, a black-and-white horror sendup called Mant.He went on to play more substantial screen parts, particularly as the small-town Mississippi mayor in In the Heat of the Night (1967) and as the judge in The Trial of the Catonsville Nine (1972). He had won an Obie Award for playing the same role in the Off Broadway play on which that movie was based, drawn from the trial of nine Roman Catholic activists who burned military draft files in Maryland in 1968 to protest the Vietnam War. (One character, and actual participant, was the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, who died on April 30.)Behind the scenes, Mr. Schallert was the versatile voice of various characters in the cartoon series The Smurfs, animated characters in commercials, and Abraham Lincoln at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Ill.Mr. Schallert was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1979 to 1981, a bitter period in its history highlighted by a protracted 1980 strike over rates and residuals for cable and satellite television and home video. Resentment over the final settlement ran high, and when he ran for re-election in 1981 he was defeated by Edward Asner, although Mr. Asner had no experience as a board member or officer. (Mr. Schallerts former television daughter Patty Duke was president of the union from 1985 to 1988. Ms. Duke died on March 29.)William Joseph Schallert was born on July 6, 1922, in Los Angeles. His father, Edwin Francis Schallert, was a longtime critic and drama editor for The Los Angeles Times; his mother, the former Elza Emily Baumgarten, was a celebrity journalist and radio commentator.He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, with the intention of becoming a composer, studying at one point under Arnold Schoenberg. But, he said, he came to the conclusion that he could not work fast enough to make a living in music, and his interest turned to acting. He found his fathers name helpful in opening doors in Hollywood.Mr. Schallert became active in theater while a student and in 1946 was a founder with the actor Sydney Chaplin and others of the highly regarded Circle Theater in Hollywood, where he appeared in a production of W. Somerset Maughams Rain directed by Mr. Chaplins father, Charlie Chaplin.In 1952, Mr. Schallert traveled to Britain on a Fulbright Fellowship to study British repertory theater. He was a guest lecturer at Oxford before returning to Los Angeles.He married Rosemarie Diann Waggner, an actress known professionally as Leah Waggner, in 1949. She died last year. Besides his son Edwin, he is survived by three other sons, Joseph, Mark and Brendan, and seven grandchildren.Looking back on his career in 2009, Mr. Schallert was philosophical. Ive never been single-minded in my pursuit of acting as a career, he said. Whatever it was that got me hired and kept me working probably was just me."}

{"text": "The sale that Loic Gouzer, Christies deputy chairman of postwar and contemporary art, put together at 5 p.m. Sunday, the first of five successive spring evening auctions, at first seemed reckless, filling a catalog with challenging, even disturbing work. With a kneeling Hitler and a wooden grid of potatoes, it was a far cry from the auction staples that can be counted on to command high prices.But the auction, called Bound to Fail (after a work by the artist Bruce Nauman) also was considered an important test of the market. Art experts said it dared true collectors to step up and prove that their tastes ran deeper than just the auction darlings.The 39-lot sale at Christies, which had been estimated to raise at least $59.4 million, brought a total of $78.1 million including buyers premiums, with 31 percent of the lots selling above their high estimates and only one failing to sell at all (those potatoes, by Sigmar Polke).It shows that its not as bad as people think, said the dealer William Acquavella afterward. If youre selective about what you put in your sales and its fresh material, it will do O.K. The sales may not be as big as they were in November  there are no $100 million items  but its still alive.Mr. Gouzers themed sale  his third in three years  was viewed as an important bellwether of what was likely to come in the crowded crop of auctions ahead; for the first time in recent memory, Christies and Sothebys will go head-to-head all in one week in New York.In that sense, the market showed that it was still there, however muted it may have been by predictions of a softening, which has resulted in smaller sales this spring and markedly less inventory at all three of the major auction houses, Christies, Sothebys and Phillips.The entire market was waiting to see what tone the auction set, said Helly Nahmad, a New York dealer, after the Christies sale on Sunday. So the fact that it was fairly strong gives the market a lot of confidence, which is good at the beginning of the sales.At Phillipss evening auction of 20th-century and contemporary art right afterward  where the actor Leonardo DiCaprio sat in a sky box  the 37-lot sale that was expected to raise at least $40.85 million ended up bringing $46.5 million with fees.With major collectors holding onto their most prized pieces in wait-and-see mode, this season is devoid of the blockbuster items and record-setting prices that have made recent auctions the stuff of banner headlines. The highest estimate is $40 million  for a Jean-Michel Basquiat at Christies on Tuesday and a Cy Twombly at Sothebys on Wednesday.Many in the art world said this round of sales represented a healthy contraction, shaking out the speculators who have propelled the market to astronomical heights and leaving behind the true value collectors. Auction houses are trying to be more circumspect about guarantees, having been forced by competition to give away much of their profit margins in the recent past. (This week, Christies and third parties have pledged minimum prices, known as guarantees, on just 18 of 100 lots at its two headline contemporary auctions; last May it guaranteed more than half of 117 works.)With Mr. Gouzers sale, Christies seemed to say it was not going to try to go after the usual big-ticket bait  the Warhols, Bacons and Richters. Instead, it was going to shake out lower-priced pieces of excellence.The biggest trophy of the Christies sale on Sunday was Maurizio Cattelans statue of Hitler, Him, estimated at $10 million to $15 million. A notorious work, the kneeling child-man figure stoked outrage when it was placed at the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto in 2012. I wanted to destroy it myself, Mr. Cattelan once said of the work. I changed my mind a thousand times, every day. Hitler is pure fear.The sale was well-timed because of Mr. Cattelans recent re-emergence from retirement, with a sculpture of a solid-gold toilet announced  but delayed  at the Guggenheim Museum.After active bidding that included the French dealer Philippe Sgalot, it was sold for $17.2 million with fees. Marianne Hoet, a Christies specialist in Brussels, was the winning telephone bidder to an undisclosed buyer.Jeff Koonss floating basketball, estimated at $12 million and one of the pieces with a third-party guarantee, went for $15.3 million with fees.Christies, which is privately owned by the French luxury goods magnate Franois-Henri Pinault, said bidding from international buyers was strong and that there were purchases by some museums, which may be announced in the next few days.The test, some art experts said, would be the amount of bidding for each item  if there were several parties competing, that would attest to a resilient market. And the bidding for many items was indeed competitive, sometimes involving as many as five parties. It was really lively and happening, said Tony Shafrazi, a collector. The pieces were very good and the response was very healthy. Thats how it should be.Immediately after the Christies event, Phillips held their second 20th Century & Contemporary evening sale in New York. The format allowed the Russian-owned auction house to bolster its sales with higher-value works by modern masters, rather than just rely on the fashionable new art that had been its trademark.This month, Phillips was dependent on presale guarantees to persuade collectors to sell desirable works. Sundays sale featured no fewer than 18 lots with third-party guarantees, plus two provided by the auction house itself.For Phillips, guarantees are absolutely crucial, said Edward Dolman, the auction houses chairman and chief executive. We try to use them judiciously.The most valuable of the third-party bets was Brice Mardens 1972-1974 black and gray striped abstract, Star (for Patti Smith), estimated at $5 million to $7 million. This minimalist portrait had never been offered at auction before. It sold for $5.9 million.Mark Bradfords monumental 2012 mixed-media canvas Building The Big White Whale was the standout contemporary work, enhanced by Mr. Bradfords recent selection as the United States representative at next years Venice Biennale. Depicting an abstracted map of France made out of red string and paper, it sold for $3.5 million with fees against a low estimate of $3 million.The appetite for the French artist Jean Dubuffet, fueled in part by Christies $24.8 million sale last May of a 1961 painting and a current show at Acquavella gallery, continued with a 1959 painting, Barbe des rites, depicting a hugely bearded male figure, attracted $3.1 million (more than double its low estimate)."}

{"text": "CAIRO  Unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets on a police minibus as it passed through a Cairo district early on Sunday, killing eight plainclothes officers in an ambush that was later claimed by the Islamic State.It was the deadliest attack on Egypts security forces in the capital in months, and a sharp reminder of the continuing threat from Islamist insurgents while President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is under increasing scrutiny for his harsh crackdown on political dissent.Although the Islamic States claim of responsibility could not be independently verified, its format and language were consistent with earlier statements from the group. The Islamic State also claims to have downed a Russian passenger jet that crashed into the Sinai Desert in October, killing 224 people.The Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement that four assailants had fired on the unmarked police minibus as it passed through Helwan, an industrial center on the southern edge of greater Cairo. The police officers were on routine security duties, the ministry said.Images on social media showed the bloodied bodies of the officers, dressed in shirts and jeans, slumped in and around a white vehicle that was raked with bullet holes.In a statement circulated on social media, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, said that soldiers of the caliphate had carried out the attack in retaliation for the imprisonment of pure women in Egyptian jails  a common justification for violence by Egyptian militants.The group identified one of the dead officers and said the attackers had taken guns from the police before escaping unhindered. Hours later, Egyptian security officials said they had tracked the assailants to a hilly area on the edge of Helwan, which they said had been sealed off as they conducted a search.Islamist insurgents based in Sinai have been fighting the Egyptian government for years, but the scale and frequency of attacks increased after the military ousted the elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in July 2013.Fighting has been mostly confined to Sinai, where the Egyptian military has a heavy presence and which is mostly sealed off to the news media. But violence has occasionally spilled over into Cairo, usually in gun attacks and small bombings.In November, four police officers at a checkpoint in Cairo were killed in a gun attack that was also claimed by the Islamic State.By lunchtime on Sunday, a funeral was underway for the slain officers, who were honored with flag-draped coffins at a service attended by the interior minister, Maj. Gen. Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, and a row of white-suited police commanders.Fears over the spread of the Islamic State, which is based in Syria and Iraq but also has a muscular presence in Libya, have helped ensure Western support for Mr. Sisi even as he faces renewed criticism for a harsh, police-led crackdown on political dissent in Egypt.More than 1,200 people were arrested last month after public protests over the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. Almost 600 of them have been formally charged, according to rights groups.Mr. Sisis popularity has also been damaged by public anger at repeated episodes of police brutality, often over trivial matters, that have resulted in the deaths of ordinary citizens. Spontaneous street protests erupted twice in recent months after officers shot and killed people in separate arguments over a taxi fare and a cup of tea.The Interior Ministry, which controls the police, was criticized by Egypts only media union after two journalists were arrested during a police raid on the unions headquarters on May 1.The furor over the arrests, which built steadily during the week, was to be debated in the Egyptian Parliament on Sunday, the state Al Ahram newspaper reported on its website. Most newspapers did not publish blackened front pages on Sunday to protest the arrests, as the union had said they would."}
{"text": "SYDNEY, Australia  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the leader of the conservative Liberal coalition government, said on Sunday that Australia would hold national elections on July 2, in a contest that is likely to be close.The election will be the first time Mr. Turnbull and his opponent, Bill Shorten, the leader of the main opposition Labor Party, have faced each other on a ballot.Mr. Shorten was appointed Labor leader after his party lost control of the government in 2013. Mr. Turnbull took over as prime minister in September after deposing his deeply unpopular, gaffe-prone predecessor, Tony Abbott, who was in his first term as prime minister.The announcement on Sunday was no surprise. The federal budget, which is the governments annual blueprint for managing the economy, was delivered a week early. And Mr. Turnbull had warned lawmakers that he would call a so-called double dissolution election, in which all Senate seats are thrown open for a vote, if the rambunctious upper house continued to block government legislation. A change in Senate rules, passed in March, means some dissenting senators from minor parties may find it hard to win re-election on July 2.At this election, Australians will have a very clear choice: to keep the course, maintain the commitment to our national economic plan for growth and jobs, or go back to Labor with its higher-taxing, higher-spending, debt-and-deficit agenda, which will stop our nations transition to the new economy dead in its tracks, Mr. Turnbull said at a news conference on Sunday in Canberra, the capital.He promised a steady hand in managing Australias economy, lower company taxes and increased job growth.Mr. Shorten, at a news conference on Sunday in Tasmania, Australias southernmost state, said Labor represented a fairer Australia. He is likely to use the campaign to highlight the contrast between his own past as a union organizer and Mr. Turnbulls as an investment banker and highly paid lawyer.The Labor Party has promised tax overhauls that would most likely affect affluent property investors by curtailing tax breaks on some investments. It has also committed to legalizing same-sex marriage within 100 days of entering office, and enacting policies to help fight climate change.If the Liberal coalition returns to power, Mr. Shorten said, Australians will see another three years of dysfunction, of dithering and disappointment.The campaign will be a long one by the standards of Australia, where a typical election campaign runs four to five weeks, and voters are already weary. Mr. Turnbull has squandered an early lead his party held in polls after unseating the staunchly conservative Mr. Abbott.Voters had expected Mr. Turnbull to be bolder and more progressive. But the governments flat-footed approach to issues like tax overhauls and education funding, and Mr. Turnbulls decision to stick with a conservative party line on same-sex marriage and climate change, have damaged his partys standing.The Liberal coalition and Labor were tied in a Fairfax Ipsos poll taken from April 14 to 16, with each garnering support from 50 percent of the 1,402 respondents. The poll has a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points.He has squandered his partys lead, said Jessica Elgood, a director of Ipsos.Geoffrey Robinson, a lecturer on politics at Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria State, said, People expected something new from the government when Mr. Turnbull took over, and he has not delivered.Both leaders have said they would maintain Australias strict policies against asylum seekers who arrive by boat. Asylum seekers are assessed at offshore camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and are not allowed to settle in Australia regardless of whether they are refugees."}
{"text": "ATLANTA  Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina is expected to respond on Monday to the Justice Departments warning that a new state law limiting the rights of transgender people is illegal, after he and the federal government failed to reach an agreement that would have allowed him to postpone his reply.Mr. McCrory said that he could not assent to the Justice Departments condition for a one-week extension  an acknowledgment by him that the law is discriminatory  and would answer by 5 p.m. on Monday.Im not going to publicly announce that something discriminates, which is agreeing with their letter, because were really talking about a letter in which theyre trying to define gender identity, and there is no clear definition of gender identity, Mr. McCrory, a Republican who is seeking re-election this year, said on Fox News Sunday. Its the federal government being a bully.The governor said that he was discussing all of our legal options, all of our political options, and he appeared to rule out the possibility that he would take some kind of independent action to undo the law, or at least limit its enforcement, as some people have suggested.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena Iverson, said on Sunday that there were ongoing discussions after officials received requests from multiple parties for an extension of the deadline in our May 6 letters, which were signed by the departments top civil rights lawyer, Vanita Gupta.In her letter to Mr. McCrory, Ms. Gupta said the Justice Department had concluded that the law, which bars people from using public restrooms that do not correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates, breached the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Mr. McCrory signed the measure, commonly referred to as House Bill 2, into law on March 23, hours after the General Assembly approved it during a one-day special session.Businesses and gay rights groups have criticized the measure and demanded its full repeal, and the bathroom provision has emerged as a particular concern to officials in Washington, who have said that the federal government might someday seek to withhold billions of dollars in aid to North Carolina.Ms. Gupta did not make such an explicit threat in her letter to Mr. McCrory, in which she said the state was engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against its employees. She gave the governor until Monday to notify the Justice Department whether he would remedy these violations of Title VII, which prohibits sex discrimination, and noted that the government could apply to the appropriate court for an order that will ensure compliance with Title VII.Ms. Gupta sent a similar letter to the University of North Carolina, which must also respond by Monday.Mr. McCrorys bid for additional time is an extension of the argument that Republican leaders in North Carolina have been making for days: that the Justice Department imposed an excessively hasty deadline to determine the future of a law they contend is crucial to public safety and privacy.The federal government, Mr. McCrory said, had given North Carolina just three working days to respond to a pretty complex letter and to a pretty big threat and that state officials dont think three working days is enough to respond to such a threat.A spokesman for Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for governor and the states attorney general, criticized Mr. McCrorys stand.Governor McCrory signed HB2 into law in the dark of night after passing it in just 12 hours, and now complains when hes given five days to defend it, the spokesman, Ford Porter, said in a statement. The governor needs to undo this law now and stop playing politics with our economy.Mr. Cooper has refused to defend the law in federal court.Although the General Assembly will reconvene before Mr. McCrory must submit his reply on Monday, there is virtually no chance that lawmakers will change the law by 5 p.m. The speaker of the State House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said last week that the deadline would come and go without action by the Republican-controlled legislature.I think we all as legislators have a duty to make sure that we analyze everything, that we look to see what our legal arguments are to counter what the Obama administration is trying to do and see what other things can be done, Mr. Moore said."}
{"text": "HOUSTON   The offers seem too good to pass up: Loans worth tens of thousands of dollars with no money down and no time limit for paying it back. The main catch, sometimes buried in the fine print, is the interest rate of 40 percent or higher.We take the weight off your shoulders, reads one pitch, while another urges borrowers to accelerate your award.Yet the recipients are a very specific and, some worry, vulnerable group: short-of-cash former N.F.L. players with cognitive impairment from years of collisions on the field.The lenders are targeting this group because the former players stand to receive as much as $5 million each in a landmark legal settlement with the N.F.L. that an appeals court affirmed last month.Already, a handful of players have borrowed thousands of dollars from these lenders, according to industry officials and players, against the payouts they hope to receive once the deal is completed after a second appeal is heard and lawyers for the league and for the players work out the logistics.This type of lending against a settlement payout is part of a legal  albeit largely unregulated  business focused mostly on victims in personal injury cases.But the loans have potentially devastating trap doors, most notably the high interest rates that kick in immediately after money is advanced, and can cut deeply into the sum a player might ultimately receive in a settlement.Some financial watchdogs find it unconscionable that lenders are wooing players who have memory problems and other cognitive ailments that could mean they cannot fully grasp what they are borrowing or the fine print behind the loans.Its predatory, its one-sided and it preys on people with brain injuries, said Richard H. Adler, a lawyer in Seattle who is not affiliated with the players but specializes in representing clients with traumatic brain injuries. Youre lending to someone who may not have the full legal capacity to understand what they are signing.Despite the risks, word is spreading in the retired player community, where former stars and journeymen who are down on their luck see the loans as a potential lifeline to paying bills and repaying debts. Industry experts say that more than a half-dozen lenders, including companies like Thrivest, Atlas Legal Fund and RD Legal Funding, are aiming to loan millions of dollars to players in five- and six-figure increments.LaCurtis Jones, 43, a linebacker who played parts of two seasons in the N.F.L. in the mid-1990s and two more years in Canada, is typical of the former players interested in a loan.He wants to borrow $100,000 to pay money he owes in child support, to help his family and to start a mentoring program for ex-convicts. His savings were depleted and work has been hard to find after he recently served time in jail because of a domestic dispute conviction. Jones also said he has struggled with depression, memory and anger issues, all of which he believes are related to his having played football.Though Jones is wary of the high interest rates, he is confident he can pay back what he owes with the six-figure settlement he hopes to receive in the settlement.I dont have none of my money left from the N.F.L., said Jones, who lives in Houston. I dont want to get into a lot of debt, but Im looking for someone to give me some advance money. I dont need much.To secure a loan, Jones has visited several neurologists to get a diagnosis that will assure his potential lender that he has a strong chance of getting a settlement once the deal is completed, something that could take many months.Most players are expected to get far less than millions. A sliding scale reduces the payouts for players who were in the league fewer than five years and players who are older than 45, and the players could spend months trying to get approved, all while the interest on their loans is piling up.Players who fail to qualify for cash settlements, however, do not have to repay what they borrow, a substantial risk for the lenders.If the case doesnt get won, the money doesnt get paid back, said Kelly Gilroy, the executive director of the American Legal Finance Association, which represents about 40 lenders. She estimated that about 25 percent of presettlement loans result in a loss to the lender because the settlement did not come through.Lenders take the chance that some loans will not be repaid because they make sizable profits from their other clients. Most presettlement loans are for small amounts, like when a person in a car accident needs $5,000 to pay hospital bills while awaiting an insurance payout. As a rule of thumb, companies lend about 10 percent of what they expect the plaintiff to be awarded.Lenders are raising that threshold to 25 percent or higher for N.F.L. players, not just because they could receive six- and seven-figure settlements, but because the N.F.L. has published a grid detailing the range of potential awards, something normally unavailable or confidential in other cases.Ron Sinai, who works for Nova Legal Funding, a company in Los Angeles that finds clients for presettlement lenders, said this information gives companies more assurance when lending to players. The N.F.L. is very careful about its image and wants to get this headache over with and pay out as soon as possible, he said.Sinai said lenders charged higher interest rates than banks because making nonrecourse loans, as they are known, was riskier. Unlike a traditional loan, the collateral is the settlement itself.If we give a guy $100,000 and the N.F.L. doesnt believe the player has dementia, were out of luck, Sinai said.Representatives of lenders dismiss claims that they take advantage of people who may not understand what they are getting into.Many companies require that a family member or lawyer represent clients with cognitive issues to ensure there is a valid contract. Their representatives add that the severity of a clients cognitive problems can vary widely.The bottom line, said Jeremy Fink, the chief operating officer of Atlas Legal Funding, is that anyone, anywhere who doesnt have the mental capacity to do it shouldnt be doing it.To be doubly sure, Sinai requires that his clients also go before a judge and testify that they understand the terms of their agreement. He also helps the players navigate the serpentine paperwork.Hes been very transparent in helping us understand and making sure the documentation from the doctors is valid, and communicating with the lawyers, said Tony George, 40, who played two years in the N.F.L. and is seeking a six-figure loan to pay for his depression and diabetes medicine and to jump-start his mentoring business.You have to ask yourself whether it is worth continuing to struggle. Usually, when we get to this type of situation, weve waited as long as we could.Some players with cognitive issues, though, are unsure of what they are borrowing. The wife of one former 45-year-old player with mild dementia said that she had stopped her husband from taking out a loan not just because of the high interest rates, but because it might take months or even years to get a settlement.If it looks good and looks pretty, you think its O.K., said the wife, who asked not to be named because of fears that talking publicly would jeopardize her husbands pending litigation with the N.F.L. But theres nothing positive about it because youre going to lose your whole settlement. Players are better off going bankrupt than taking out one of these loans.Still, for former players who need money now, not later, the loans look like risks worth taking.Im just trying to borrow enough so when the settlement comes through I can pay it back, Jones said. We sacrificed ourselves so we can make millions of dollars for the owners, but we also sacrificed our health."}
{"text": "The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar that has been systematically denied the most elemental rights: citizenship, freedom of worship, education, marriage and travel. Tens of thousands of the Rohingya were driven from their homes by violence in 2012; last year many tried to flee persecution and deprivation in desperate sea voyages.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi  Myanmars leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate  does not want to call them Rohingya, the name they use, because nationalist Buddhists want to perpetuate the myth that they are Bengalis who dont belong in Myanmar. She has also asked the United States ambassador not to use the term. Her advice is wrong and deeply disappointing. The Rohingya are every bit as Burmese as she is.There are many possible reasons Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi  whose 15 years under house arrest made her one of the worlds best known and most respected political prisoners  might be reluctant to publicly embrace the Rohingya cause. It has been barely a month since she became leader of Myanmars first democratically elected government since 1962, with the title of state counselor, and she no doubt fears antagonizing the Buddhist nationalists who angrily demonstrated outside the United States Embassy in late April after the embassy referred to the Rohingya community in a letter of condolence for Rohingya victims of a boat sinking.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi may fear that publicly calling these people by their name would upset the national reconciliation process, as a Foreign Ministry official said, or worse: that it would rekindle the terrible violence that erupted in 2012 between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine State.There is no question that Rakhine State, one of the poorest in Myanmar, is a complex tinderbox of sectarian resentments that requires the most cautious of political approaches. But these simply cannot be based on a perpetuation of the systematic persecution and marginalization of the Rohingya in Myanmars social and political life. They certainly cannot be based on denying the Rohingya even their name.In the end, the reason Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi doesnt want the Americans to say Rohingya doesnt really matter. What matters is that a woman whose name has been synonymous with human rights for a generation, a woman who showed unflinching courage in the face of despotism, has continued an utterly unacceptable policy of the military rulers she succeeded.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi would be wise to reconsider her stance immediately. Her halo has been a central factor in Myanmars reacceptance into the world community after decades of ostracism, but already there are calls by human rights groups in the United States for President Obama to renew sanctions against the country before they expire on May 20."}
{"text": "The Republican establishment is finally having its moment.Up to this point, no one has had a rougher 2016 than the partys ostensible chieftains: Its top strategists and donors have been thwarted at the ballot box, and Donald J. Trump has turned Republican congressional leaders into a punch line on the stump.But that has changed in the last few days, as Mr. Trump has struggled to make peace with Republicans in Washington  and Hillary Clinton has made an aggressive bid to win over party elders aghast at Mr. Trumps emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee.Suddenly, these dreaded insiders are the most sought-after people in politics.Mr. Trump is headed to Washington on Thursday to huddle with Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who announced last week that he was not prepared to back Mr. Trump for president. It could take a command performance on Capitol Hill for Mr. Trump to turn around his listing candidacy, at least with the elite groups that have rounded on him since last week.His impatience in demanding their support has irked them only further: Mr. Trump huffed at a campaign stop over the weekend that Mr. Ryan was being cute about his endorsement. But a senior aide to Mr. Trump, Paul J. Manafort, said on Fox News that the campaign took the need for party unity seriously. (Trump understands this, he said.)Mr. Trump is facing serious competitive pressure from outside the party: Mrs. Clinton, implicitly turning the page on her primary against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has begun casting her campaign as a safe haven for anti-Trump Republicans. She told CBS over the weekend that she saw her campaign welcoming non-Democrats who had respect for the office of the presidency and deep concern about Mr. Trumps capacity to hold the job.And the voters will get to weigh in again, too, this week: Mr. Sanders is seen as having an upper hand in the West Virginia primary, and it is worth watching whether any significant protest vote shows up against Mr. Trump there or in Nebraskas now-ornamental Republican primary election."}

Ryan, disavowing an allys call fora primary challenge against Mr. Ryan.Mr. Ryan responded bysayinghe would step down from his position as chairman of the Republican National Convention in July if that is what the partys presumptive nominee requests.After Mr. Ryan, the nations highest-ranking elected Republican, said last week that he was not ready to endorse Mr.Trump for president,Mr. Trumpon Sundayrefused to rule out blocking Mr. Ryanfrom the convention role.Also on Sunday, oneof Mr. Trumps top supporters, the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, called for a primary challenge against Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.But by Monday, both Mr. Trumpand Mr. Ryanappeared to be backing away slightly from confrontation.Mr. Trump disavowed any hand in Ms. Palins remarksin a morning interview on CNNwith Chris Cuomo.Shes a terrific person, but shes very much a free agent and I didnt know about this until yesterday, Mr. Trump said. I guess shes been fighting, or shes endorsing somebody thats running against Paul Ryan, and I didnt know about it until yesterday when I read about it.For his part, Mr. Ryan told aMilwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist,Christian Schneider, Ill do whatever he asks me to do, referring to Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Ryan, Brendan Buck, said he understood Mr. Schneidersreport to be accurate.Mr. Ryan is the most high-profile member of Congress to say he is not comfortable throwing his support to the presumptive nominee, citingtheir significant policy differences and the tone of Mr. Trumps campaign.Mr. Trump is to meetwith Mr. Ryan on Thursday at the Republican National Committee headquarters in two separate meetings  one with the House Republican conference and one with just Mr. Ryan and Reince Priebus, the party chairman and an ally of the speaker.Mr. Trump spoke warmly of Mr. Ryan on CNN Monday morning.Ive always liked him, Mr. Trump said. He called me not so long ago, I dont know, a number of weeks ago, but he called me and he was very supportive and very nice and I thought everything was fine, and then I got blindsided, so well see.Mr. Trump could be facing a tough crowd on Thursday. A number of House Republicans have taken issue with his tone and positions throughout the campaign.Mr. Ryan has said he might still be able to endorse Mr. Trump, but that he needed to hear more from him.The meetings may be further complicated by Mr. Trumps recent statements on fiscal issues.Mr. Ryan has served as chairman of the House budget committee, and has a strict set of policy views that generally adhere to conservative orthodoxy on issues like taxes and monetary policy. ButMr. Trump seemed to challenge those views in the last week, when he suggested in a string of interviews that he would increase taxes on high earners, that repaying the national debt would not be a problem for Washington because you print the moneyand that he would be open to an increase in the minimum wage, a concept Republicans oppose at the federal level.In the CNN interview, Mr. Trump  who has made his political mark as the tell-it-like-it-is candidate  tried to counter questions that he was flip-flopping on policy issues.Let me just set it straight, Mr. Trump said in talking of his past tax proposals. I put in the biggest tax decrease of anybody running for office by far, O.K., and many people think its great, and if anything, I was criticized because its too steep a cut, but thats O.K., but I put in by far the biggest tax decrease.He added, What I said  and that really is a proposal because we have to go to Congress, we have to go to the Senate, we have to go to our congressmen and women and we have to negotiate a deal. So it really is a proposal, but its a very steep proposal.Then he said, I said that I may have to increase the section  and by the way, everybody across the board, businesses, everybodys getting a tax cut, especially the middle class. And I said that I may have to increase it on the wealthy. Im not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class. Now, if I increase on the wealthy, that means theyre still going to be paying less than they pay now.But he added, Im not talking about increasing from this point, Im talking about increasing from my tax proposal."}

He was 87 and the oldest working member of the Costume Designers Guild.His death was confirmed by his niece and closest survivor, Jean Drufner, who said a cause had not yet been determined.Mr. Turner was introduced to fashion when he was 7 and worked after school in his parents clothing store in Florida. He became stage-struck in college productions, acted in summer stock and headed to Hollywood in 1950 hoping to find work as an actor. Instead, after a stint with a small theater company, he was steered to the wardrobe department at NBC, which he later managed.He eventually partnered with two other designers whose fashions had become famous on red carpets and on television and film screens, Bob Mackie and Ray Aghayan, and went on to design for The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, The Donny and Marie Show, Mamas Family and the Carol Burnett series Carol & Company, as well as Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, Dinah Shore and the Kennedy Centers 25th-anniversary show in 1996.Mr. Turner, Mr. Mackie and Mr. Aghayan worked for Elizabeth Courtney Costumes, which later became known as Ret Turner Costume Rentals and closed a few months ago.In 1986, Mr. Turner went to Chers home to dress her in a head-turning outfit designed by Mr. Mackie  a revealing beaded black gown and towering headgear fabricated from 800 rooster feathers  which she wore when she presented Don Ameche with his best supporting actor Oscar for Cocoon.It certainly created a stir, Mr. Turner recalled in a 2003 interview with the Television Academy Foundations Archive of American Television. Don Ameche said, I would never have been photographed getting my Oscar if it had not have been Cher standing next to me.Still, Mr. Turner said he objected to fashion that exposed too much flesh.All that was shown on Cher was never offensive, he said. It was exciting, it was titillating, but it was never offensive.He described his style as neat and clean, not flamboyant.Walter Raymond Turner was born in Marianna, Fla., northwest of Tallahassee, on April 14, 1929, to C. Davis Turner and the former Gene Abel. He got his nickname in high school when it was faddish to spell names backward  his first name became Retlaw, which was shortened to Ret.He graduated from Stetson University in DeLand, Fla.Mr. Turner worked for a wide variety of show business personalities, including Bing Crosby, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm, Pinky Lee, Spike Jones and Mitzi Gaynor.Although Mr. Turner won five Emmys for costume design between 1978 and 1991, he said he never considered himself a fashionista.Ive never been interested in fashion, he said. I liked costuming.He particularly enjoyed working on variety shows.It was all so spectacular, Mr. Turner said. We were given a format, and we did a lot of clothes, and those dancers changed outfits sometimes eight times during a four-minute musical number, and they were all incredible looking."}

{"text": "Boston  ITS only May, but this presidential election is on track to be one of the most expensive ever. So far two-thirds of political advertising dollars have largely come from anonymous corporate donations, funneled through what have been referred to as dark money nonprofit groups that freely engage in electoral and legislative politics, but dont have to disclose their donors, expenditures or even their members.One of the most promising strategies to stem the tide of corporate dark money is a proposed rule at the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require public companies to report the amounts and recipients of their political spending. The rule has received a groundswell of support from a bipartisan group of former S.E.C. commissioners, state treasurers and law professors, and has generated more than one million public comments.Defenders of the status quo argue the companies are simply exercising their right to free speech; critics contend that such speech, when anonymous, does immense harm to the democratic process.But as lawyers who specialize in investor rights, we see another critical, nonpartisan reason to support the rule: When it comes to political spending, companies are often not as informed as one might think  especially when it comes to dark money.By mandating disclosure, the rule would allow investors to serve as a potential check on risky political donations, and help investors determine whether a companys political spending habits make its shares a good investment in the first place.In theory, a company gives money to influence politics in its favor. But there are countless examples where dark-money spending has undermined their business interests. In fact, giving to dark-money groups may be the riskiest kind of political spending, because companies often have no idea who else is giving, and whether their interests are in competition.For example, in 2010 Target, a company that supports gay rights and has openly gay employees, donated $150,000 to a Minnesota organization called MN Forward, which advocates pro-business tax and economic development policies. But MN Forward ran TV ads supporting a candidate for governor who sought a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. When news about the donation came to light, the company faced an employee backlash and a boycott from consumers that ultimately resulted in a personal apology from Gregg Steinhafel, Targets chief executive, and the formation of a committee to review the companys political spending.That same year, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association whose members include major manufacturers of contraceptive products such as Merck and Johnson & Johnson, gave a total of $4.8 million to two nonprofits, the American Action Network and the American Future Fund, because they promoted limited government. Both organizations, however, used the money to help elect lawmakers who voted to eliminate funding for access to contraceptives through programs like Title X and Planned Parenthood.A number of corporations had also placed their business interests at risk as members of the American Legislative Exchange Council, until they resigned in 2014. For instance, while Google was devoting significant resources toward developing green energy technologies, its ALEC membership dues were helping campaigns seeking to gut renewable energy standards.Why arent companies more careful? One major reason is that the very nature of dark-money giving means that investors have virtually no information about it, and therefore cannot hold companies accountable for their mistakes.Political spending is considered an ordinary business expense under corporate law, which means that companies have no obligation to disclose it to shareholders (and rarely do so voluntarily). It is therefore impossible for investors to track dark-money spending, at best learning about it long after the fact from watchdog groups and investigative journalists.The rule wouldnt restrict the companies right to give money, and there may be instances where political spending is a smart move. For example, a company may reasonably believe that giving to an organization that opposes some of its products is worthwhile because the organization successfully lobbies for lower corporate tax rates.Beyond the risk to business interests, investors should have a right to know whether their money is going toward politicians, legislation or causes that they support or oppose, as union members already have. More and more investors are choosing to make decisions on that basis: Between 2012 and 2014, socially responsible investing in the United States increased by 76 percent, from $3.74 trillion to $6.75 trillion.The S.E.C. has yet to officially endorse a political-spending rule. However, this week, the commission will be required to finally state its position on the rule in response to a lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We believe that, in addition to the integrity of our democracy, transparent political spending is essential to good corporate governance and sound investment."}
{"text": "MOSCOW  Hailing the Soviet Union for having brought freedom to other peoples and taking a swipe at the West over unacceptable double standards, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia presided on Monday over the traditional Victory Day exhibition of military might in Red Square.Among the many weapons on display were warplanes of the type Moscow has deployed in Syria and an updated version of the Buk antiaircraft missile system that, according to Dutch investigators, shot down a passenger aircraft over eastern Ukraine in 2014.The military parade and flyby in Moscow signaled the start of a nationwide series of such events, an annual commemoration of the Soviet Unions defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and of the 26 million Soviet soldiers and citizens who died during World War II, far more than in any other country. Smaller parades were held across the country and at a Russian military base in Syria.After the solemn, lock-step formality of events in Red Square, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Russians streamed through Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities later on Monday holding placards pasted with black-and-white photographs of relatives who fought and, in many cases, died during the war. Known as the immortal regiment, the commemoration began in 2012 in the Siberian city of Tomsk as a private initiative but proved so popular that it has since been embraced and, critics say, hijacked by government authorities. Mr. Putin marched at the front of a huge remembrance procession in Moscow, holding a picture of his father, Vladimir, a war veteran who was wounded fighting the Nazis.Moscow held its first grand victory parade in 1945, an event presided over by  Stalin, and then resumed the ritual in 1965 under the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. The tradition halted after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union until President Boris N. Yeltsin revived it in 1995. But the parades have taken on new significance under Mr. Putin, who has used them to showcase Russias military revival and renewed national pride after the chaos of the 90s.Victory Day has also become a festival of Soviet nostalgia, with Mr. Putin greeting soldiers on Monday as comrades, citizens donning Red Army hats and, in some cases, full uniforms, and state-run television channels showing little but war movies and footage of the parade.Our soldiers and commanders have proved that they are worthy successors of the Great Patriotic War heroes and that they honorably protect the interests of Russia, Mr. Putin, using the Russian term for World War II, said in his speech from a Red Square reviewing stand near a granite tomb containing the embalmed corpse of Lenin, the Soviet Unions founder.As has become customary, Mr. Putin made no mention of his countrys principal allies during the war, the United States and Britain. But he allowed that Russia was open to working with other nations to combat what he called the global threat of terrorism and to create a modern, nonaligned system of international security, a system that Moscow believes has been blocked by the existence of NATO and the expansion of the United States-led military alliance into former Soviet territory in the Baltics.In an apparent swipe at the West, particularly the United States, he said, Comrades, history lessons teach us that peace on Earth is not established by itself; that one needs to be cautious; that double standards as well as shortsighted indulgence of those who nurture criminal plans are impermissible. The remark seemed to refer to Washingtons support for rebel groups in Syria that Russia views as terrorist organizations.This years parade was scaled back from last years event, which had marked the 70th anniversary of Russias victory, but it still included 10,000 troops  6,000 fewer than in 2015  and a flotilla of tanks, armored personnel carriers and missile systems. Among them were Iskander short-range ballistic missiles of the type that Russia has deployed in the western Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a move that NATOs secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said last year would fundamentally change the balance of security in Europe.Watched by Mr. Putin and by President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, the procession of military vehicles across the cobblestones of Red Square was led by a Soviet-era T-34 tank, the mainstay of Red Army forces as they beat back Hitlers army, which invaded in 1941, and then advanced to conquer Berlin in 1945. Behind it rumbled the Armata T-14, a new generation of battle tank first displayed last year, and around 100 other vehicles and weapon systems, including Russias latest Yars mobile intercontinental nuclear missile launcher. A battalion of female soldiers took part for the first time.Also on display was the S-400 air defense missile system, which Russia has deployed in Syria to protect its base at Latakia, and Buk surface-to-air missiles, an updated version of the system that the Dutch Safety Board, in a report issued in October, said was fired in July 2014 at Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over territory held by Russian-backed separatists. The plane, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, crashed, killing all 298 passengers and crew members on board.Russia has denied any role in the catastrophe, advancing so-far-unsubstantiated theories that Ukrainian warplanes had been responsible or that the Ukrainians had attacked Flight 17 with their own Buk system."}
{"text": "The worlds space agencies are calling for a new generation of satellites that would be precise enough to map greenhouse gas emissions from individual nations. Their goal is to replace decades of rough estimates with advanced monitoring of what has become one of the worlds foremost concerns.The plan, based on a growing body of research in space sensors, is delicate politically because the global system could verify or cast doubt on emission reports from the 196 member states of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was adopted in 1992. If built, the system could serve as an independent way to measure greenhouse gases and encourage lax countries to better comply with abatement goals.The recent Paris accord, which calls for the verification and certification of emission reductions, essentially gave the plan a diplomatic stamp of approval.The proposed system of satellites, six to eight in all, would be in orbit by 2030 to map clouds of carbon dioxide, the invisible gas linked to climate change. Rough estimates put the systems cost around $5 billion. It would resemble the global fleet of weather satellites that observe water clouds.Officials call the undertaking crucial for better dealing with aspects of climate change linked to civilizations waste gases.Its what we have to do if planet Earth is to be saved, said Jean-Yves Le Gall, the head of Frances space agency and a leader of the initiative. Its a consciousness shared by the heads of all the space agencies.Its well known that carbon dioxide emissions from natural sources and fossil-fuel combustion merge slowly into a global average long reported to be rising. But the exact contributions of individual countries are something of a mystery.Each nation draws on a mix of surface readings, economic analyses and ecological estimates to quantify their emissions. Experts say the self-reporting varies enormously in thoroughness, frequency and accuracy.The 1992 climate accord calls on industrial states to issue reports annually, typically with much documentation. But developing countries, which comprise the vast majority of the pacts signatories, are required to make only sporadic communications. For instance, the worlds biggest emitter, China, issued reports in 2004 and 2012.The sense of urgency behind the satellite plan arises in part because developing countries a decade ago surpassed industrial nations as global emitters of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel combustion. Their estimated share stands at 60 percent.Climate experts say the rising percentage of sketchy information makes the overall portrait of global emitters increasingly blurry.The uncertainty, an October study by the European Commission said, has increased up to the point where it could undermine the credibility and the stability of future climate agreements.Starting last fall, space agency leaders from China, India and other developing countries and industrial powers, including the United States, seized on such analyses to begin arguing for the satellite fleet. Last month, at a meeting in New Delhi, they issued a draft public declaration.An international independent way of estimating emission changes, it said, would create a level playing field.On Monday, Frances space agency, known as CNES, for Centre National dEtudes Spatiales, based in Paris, said it had sent a penultimate draft for approval to the worlds space agencies, 67 in all. The French agency added that it expects a final declaration by Monday.The fleet proposal grows out of strides in the development of carbon-dioxide sensors for use in space. In 2002, the European Space Agency launched an environmental satellite, and in 2014 NASA sent up the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, a satellite that takes readings of the earths atmosphere nearly a million times a day.China, Japan and France plan to launch three more research satellites from now to 2020. Europe and the United States are considering two more.Experts say that making sufficient progress in the tricky research to warrant the establishment of an operational fleet will pose a major challenge, especially in learning how to distinguish human emissions from natural fluxes.This is hard science, said Stephen W. Pacala, a Princeton University scientist who was the chairman of a National Research Council study on verifying greenhouse gas emissions. The aspiration is marvelous. But the devil here is very much in the scientific details.The fleet, for instance, would have to differentiate new human releases not only from the globes existing blanket of carbon dioxide but from such natural sources as volcanoes, forest fires and decomposing plants and animals.Michael H. Freilich, the director of NASAs Earth Science Division, said the goal was nonetheless easier in some respects than monitoring the weather from orbiting spacecraft. Clouds and storms are tracked on scales of minutes to hours, he said, whereas the necessary time frame for scrutinizing carbon-dioxide plumes ranges from days to weeks.The trouble, he added, is that each measurement you make is going to be harder.Dr. Freilich said that he had no doubt that the worlds scientists in coming years would learn how to turn measurements into information that could help determine if nations are meeting their reduction goals.Would such a capability spark global resentment? Could it stir fears of an orbital police force?This is exactly what we want to avoid, Dr. Le Gall of the French space agency said last week in an interview. Its a risk. But its why we want to have all the space agencies involved and agreeing on the best way forward.In 2010, when the National Research Council released Verifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Methods to Support International Climate Agreements, Dr. Pacala took the opportunity to stress how a new era of precise measurement could have positive implications for diplomacy.An objective system, he noted, would give nations confidence that their neighbors are living up to their commitments."}
{"text": "The Republican primaries this year could easily shake your faith in democracy. The race whittled a field of 17 candidates down to a showdown between the two candidates with the highest unfavorability ratings in national polls.In many respects, Donald Trump was less conservative than every other candidate; Ted Cruz was more so. Neither appeared to set mainstream Republicans in his sights.You might think that democracys not supposed to work this way  that more broadly acceptable candidates should have risen to the top. Many Republicans I know worry that this outcome reflects a sickness in the Republican electorate. Perhaps. But maybe it is just an illustration of the inherent imperfection of democratic institutions.The failure of democracy to provide a coherent ranking of political hopefuls is a central insight of the subfield of economics and political science known as social choice theory. The issue is neatly illustrated by Condorcets paradox, which shows that a shifting set of coalitions can make a collective body appear that it has no idea what it wants.Heres how. Think about the Republican Party as an alliance of moderates, conservatives and populists. A coalition of populists and moderates will vote to ensure a populist beats a conservative. Conservatives and populists will vote together to ensure a conservative beats a moderate. And moderates and conservatives will join forces to help a moderate beat a populist.The paradox is that these preferences form a cycle in which the populist is preferred to the conservative, who is preferred to the moderate, who is preferred to the populist, even though the populist was preferred to the conservative, who was preferred to the moderate.Its as if the voters prefer chocolate ice cream to strawberry, strawberry to vanilla, and vanilla to chocolate  a bizarre cycle that suggests that voters believe that each candidate is both better and worse than each of the alternatives.Its as if the will of the people is an incoherent concept.The problem is not that individual voters are clueless; in this story, theyre not. Even if each individual voter is rational and knows what he or she wants, the electorate as a whole can act as if it were clueless and cant decide. Individually rational choices dont necessarily add up to collectively rational choices.The depressing thing is that the problem is actually worse than this. The Marquis Condorcet, a French mathematician in the second half of the 18th century, showed how a majority-rule vote can lead to incoherent collective choices.But Kenneth Arrow, the economics Nobel laureate, showed in his 1951 doctoral thesis that the problem runs far deeper than anyone had imagined. Mr. Arrows impossibility theorem says that there is no mechanism that can coherently speak for the will of the people.Loosely speaking, this extraordinary result says that any mechanism that aims to speak for the will of the people  that is, not a dictatorship  will be susceptible to at least one of three defects.The first possible defect is the problem the marquis illustrated  the problem of preference cycles. The second possible defect is that voters will make choices that suggest that the addition of irrelevant alternatives leads them to change their minds. This is the equivalent of choosing chocolate over vanilla, only to reverse course and choose vanilla instead, once strawberry has been added to the menu.The third possibility is that even when each voter individually prefers chocolate ice cream to vanilla, somehow collectively the voters will choose vanilla instead. (Im grateful to the economist Alex Tabarrok for this ice cream analogy.)The news isnt all bad. The fact that any voting rule is susceptible to one of these defects doesnt mean that the voters must make incoherent choices, merely that it could happen. (And perhaps it just did.)Mr. Arrows impossibility theorem suggests that maybe the Republican primary results say less about the desires of Republican voters than they do about tensions inherent in groups of people collectively deciding what to do.Economic theorists have also pointed to a reason that the modern G.O.P. may be particularly susceptible to making strange choices. If disagreements between voters are simple enough  such as when some want more liberal policies and others more conservative policies  simple majority rule wont result in any of the defects that concerned Mr. Arrow. Perhaps disagreements between Democrats are this simple.But Republicans disagree both about the desirability of conservative versus moderate policies and about the need for an outsider or an establishment leader. This extra complexity again raises the possibility of collective irrationality even in the face of individual logic.The point isnt that democracy is bad, merely that its imperfect. And so even if this theorem points to the impossibility of a truly rational democracy, it doesnt mean that the alternatives are any better. As Winston Churchill once said, Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."}
{"text": "Uber and Lyft were not bluffing.On Monday, the two leaders of the booming ride-hailing industry halted service in Austin, Tex., after losing a legislative fight over how they screen their drivers.The decision to leave an energetic city known for its young, well-educated population offered a stark illustration of how strenuously the companies oppose new rules that would require them to perform fingerprint background checks on drivers.Ending the service also meant that about 10,000 drivers would be out of work, Taylor Patterson, an Uber spokeswoman, said.Folks are devastated, she said. People are saying, I dont know how Im going to pay my rent.The legislative fight playing out in Austin, the Texas capital, has been watched closely by municipalities across the country as they ponder how to handle public-safety issues posed by the so-called sharing economy.Austins City Council voted in 2015 to require that the companies subject their drivers to fingerprint background checks, which could turn up criminal records. The regulation was fiercely opposed by the industry as unnecessary and less effective than its own system.Uber and Lyft, both based in California, responded by underwriting a nearly $9 million campaign against the ordinance that culminated with an up-or-down vote by Austin residents on Saturday. Nearly 56 percent voted to preserve the measure, which also includes requirements for identifying vehicles and data reporting.Both companies described the result as bitterly disappointing on Monday.Unfortunately, the rules passed by the City Council dont allow true ride-sharing to operate, Lyft said in a statement. Instead, they make it harder for part-time drivers, the heart of Lyfts peer-to-peer model, to get on the road and harder for passengers to get a ride.Lawmakers and some law enforcement professionals have argued that fingerprint checks, which are required of Austins taxi drivers, are the best way to establish a persons identity and weed out those with criminal records.Uber has said that its own checks, performed by the third-party provider Checkr, include scrutiny of court records and other biographical information and are more effective than the fingerprint checks, which it said rely on incomplete federal databases.Industry experts have noted that the fingerprint rules, which go fully into effect next February, could pose a potentially time-intensive and costly new burden on the companies and their drivers.Yet Uber still operates in two cities that require fingerprint checks: Houston and New York. Ms. Patterson, the spokeswoman, said the company was in New York for good, but that it was pressing its case in Houston and could potentially pull up stakes there. Lyft left Houston in 2014.Last week in Miami-Dade County, after a battle of more than two years, transportation officials legalized ride-sharing services with no requirement that drivers be subjected to fingerprint background checks.David Butts, a political consultant in Austin who helped lead a campaign to preserve the new ordinance, accused Uber and Lyft of putting corporate strategy above public safety.But were a progressive city, Mr. Butts said. We happen to believe that government has a role to play. And the idea that were just going to give them a blank check and say, Self-regulate and well take your word for it was not acceptable to the majority of voters in this city.In addition to Uber and Lyft, at least three ride-hailing companies are operating in Austin, a center of technology that hosts the South by Southwest festival and is home to the University of Texas flagship campus.City officials said other companies were making inquiries on Monday after the announcements by Uber and Lyft.Get Me, a new ride-sharing company in Austin, said it had been asked repeatedly how it would respond if its larger rivals left. The open and honest answer is, as its always been, were not going anywhere, the company said in a statement on Facebook.Councilwoman Ann Kitchen, who led the effort to tighten the regulation of ride-hailing companies, said in an interview on Monday that the city was open to continuing talks with Uber and Lyft.Of course, we have always said to Uber and Lyft that they are welcome here and we didnt ask them to leave, she said. But we have got to respect the will of the voters."}
{"text": "NEW HAVEN  The image we see when the curtain rises on Happy Days is as bizarre as it is bleak, even by the hardly cheery standards of the plays author, Samuel Beckett. Winnie, the central character  really the only one  is immured in earth up to her waist. In the Yale Repertory Theater production here, the Winnie who greets us after the ringing of the wake-up bell is none other than Dianne Wiest, the Oscar winner and onetime regular in Woody Allen movies who has recently returned to the stage, where her career began.Ms. Wiest mostly makes a mouthwatering match for the role. Her still-girlish puff of a voice is perfect for Winnies indomitably chipper spirit as she spends her long hours babbling merrily, keeping up a bright sheen of optimism, expecting every day to be a happy day, in benign acceptance of her strange predicament. Ms. Wiest can also, of course, drop that voice to a husky growl, as she memorably did in Mr. Allens Bullets Over Broadway. She deftly uses this register when Winnies veneer of satisfaction occasionally, briefly, cracks open to reveal the loneliness and fear underneath.In Happy Days, Beckett presents one of his most powerful emblems of the trap that human life can become. Winnie inhabits a postapocalyptic world, and greets her predicament with an absurdly blithe attitude. But in her dogged attempts to pass the days profitably  brushing her teeth, taking her medicine, filing her nails, attempting to jostle into life her companion, the barely seen and virtually immobile Willie (a convincingly decrepit Jarlath Conroy)  she represents a mordant image of the existential struggle that can haunt us all.The fear so great, certain days, as Winnie puts it, of finding oneself  left, with hours still to run, before the bell for sleep, and nothing more to say, nothing more to do.Like the characters in Waiting for Godot, Winnie will go on with her meaningless existence until it ends  if it ever does. She is an embodiment of the unquenchable, unreasoning life force, and also its uselessness against the fates that resign us all to oblivion in the end, and sometimes a living death well before it.Ms. Wiest and her director, the Yale Repertory Theater chief James Bundy, move us through Winnies rambling monologues with a supple feel for their varying texture, from high-flown literary quotations to the halting moments when the tap seems to run dry and Winnie loses track of her thoughts. Ms. Wiest is particularly delicious when she is mimicking an encounter with a couple who came upon her and stood watching in perplexity: Whats she doing? Why doesnt he dig her out?At times the pacing might be tighter  a pause can open up into an existential abyss for poor Winnie  and Ms. Wiest tends to slip notes of piteousness into her delivery that border on the sentimental. (Was I lovable once? she asks.) Even a teaspoon of sugar can be enough to dissolve the scorching effect of a Beckett play, and Ms. Wiests naturally winsome persona perhaps doesnt help.Other aspects of the play are a little softened, too; the red velvet curtain and old-fashioned scallop-shell footlights lend an antique charm that frames it too quaintly. The bell that signaled the beginning or end of Winnies days sounded too churchy to me: piercingly is the word Beckett used to describe its ringing, and here the sound could hardly be described as such.But any actress undertaking this challenging role deserves a medal for valor, and Ms. Wiests entrancingly funny, ultimately harrowing performance certainly deserves one. (Ms. Wiest has called it, with justification, the Hamlet for women.)The physical challenges alone are daunting. In the plays second act, Winnies situation is more dire. The girdle of earth has swallowed her all the way up to her neck. No more resorting to the diversions in her handbag, or protecting herself from the scorching sun with a parasol.Most ominously, the gun that Winnie pulls from her bag and kisses affectionately in the opening moments is now beyond her reach. When Willie scrabbles out of his (unseen) hole and crawls desperately toward the top of the mound from which Winnies head peeks out, is he reaching to comfort her, as she fondly hopes, or is he groping for the gun that lies nearby?In these late passages Ms. Wiest is at her finest and least sentimental, as Winnie still attempts to distract herself from doom. No arms? Well, she can take an inventory of her face, puffing out her cheeks to make sure they are still there, checking on the nose. Its hard not to watch the reduction of her life to such meager pleasures and see in it the inevitable depredations of age that will assail us all. (And thats if we are, ahem, lucky.)But pinning down the meanings in Beckett can be a mugs game; he referred to Happy Days, cryptically, as no more than another dramatic object. As this fine production and Ms. Wiests fearless performance attest, call it what you will, Happy Days remains one of the most unsettling and unforgettable plays in the modern canon."}
{"text": "Renaud Laplanche and his crew steered a 105-foot racing boat through New York Harbor one day last spring, its towering sails ripping across the water at 30 knots.An accomplished sailor and founder of Lending Club, Mr. Laplanche was hosting executives from hedge funds, Goldman Sachs and other banks  part of his effort to win over Wall Street on his plans to upend traditional banking with a faster, more democratic form of lending.He already had endorsements from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, and John Mack, the former chief of Morgan Stanley, who joined his board. At Lending Clubs initial public offering in December 2014, the company was valued at over $8 billion.But on Monday, Lending Club announced that Mr. Laplanche had resigned after an internal investigation found improprieties in its lending process, including the altering of millions of dollars worth of loans. The companys stock price, already reeling in recent months, fell 34 percent.The companys woes are part of a broader reckoning in the online money-lending industry. Last week, Prosper, another online lender that focuses on consumers, laid off more than a quarter of its work force, and the chief executive said he was forgoing his salary for the year.The problems at Lending Club, in particular, threaten to confirm some of Wall Streets worst fears: that as favorable economic conditions begin to turn, they will reveal many upstart companies with weak internal controls that have been feeding inaccurate information to starry-eyed investors.It is clear this is bad news not just for Lending Club, but for our entire industry, Peter Renton, who founded Lendit, a leading industry conference, wrote in a blog post on Monday. Really bad.Marketplace lenders like Lending Club have created easy-to-use websites that match consumers and small businesses, hoping to borrow a few thousand dollars, with individuals or Wall Street investors looking to lend money.Freed from the costs of brick-and-mortar branches and federal regulations requiring that they reserve money against their loans, marketplace lenders have been able to grow quickly and with fewer expenses.The process is almost entirely online, with loans approved in days rather than the weeks a traditional bank might take.While marketplace loans account for less than 1 percent of the consumer loans in the United States, a recent report by the investment bank Jefferies said that in some segments  like installment loans  the new lending companies account for more than 10 percent of the market.Just months ago, it seemed marketplace lenders couldnt churn out loans fast enough. Investors like hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds were clamoring to buy large pools of these loans, which offered an attractive return at a time of record low interest rates.But in the first quarter, lenders like Lending Club, Prosper and OnDeck Capital had difficulty convincing investors that their business models are sound.Even though the majority of the companies borrowers continue to pay their loans on time, Wall Street investors have started to worry about the prospect of increasing defaults.Last week, the small business lender OnDeck said demand for securitized packages of its loans had all but vanished in the first quarter.Investors are shooting first and asking questions later, said Christopher C. Brendler, a financial analyst at Stifel, the investment bank.Wall Streets waning demand for loans exposed the Achilles heel of marketplace lending. Unlike traditional banks that use their deposits to fund loans, the marketplace companies discovered how fleeting their funding sources can be.Since the start of the year, Lending Club has raised interest rates on its loans three times to sweeten their appeal to investors.As the pressure to sell loans mounted across the industry, the problems began to surface at Lending Club, according to two people briefed on the companys internal investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.They said that in early April, a Lending Club employee discovered that the dates on about $3 million of loan applications appeared to have been altered in some way. The employee raised the issue with Mr. Laplanche, who alerted the companys internal auditor.That inquiry led to the discovery of more irregularities, these two people said. This time, it appeared that about $22 million in loans that had been sold to Jefferies did not meet the investment banks criteria.While the discrepancy was fairly minor, they said the Lending Club board considered it a serious issue. The company bought back all of the loans.A key principle of the company is maintaining the highest levels of trust with borrowers, investors, regulators, stockholders and employees, Hans Morris, who on Monday was named Lending Clubs executive chairman, a newly created role, said in a statement.The two people briefed on the internal investigation said it had turned up another issue. Mr. Laplanche had a stake in an investment fund that the company was also considering whether to invest in. But Mr. Laplanche had failed to disclose his personal investment to the board.Mr. Laplanche did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Laplanche, in many ways, was considered the face of his industry. He is a French-born lawyer who spent the early part of his career at Cleary Gottlieb, a large corporate law firm.He came up with the idea to start Lending Club in 2006 after seeing how little banks paid people to deposit their money and how much those same banks charged to lend. We wanted to lower the spread, he said in an interview last year.Mr. Laplanche is also a world-class sailor who holds two speed records. He would frequently take his staff in San Francisco sailing.Last Friday, the board informed Mr. Laplanche of its conclusions, making it clear that he had lost its confidence. Three senior managers involved in the loan sales have either resigned or were fired. The companys president, Scott Sanborn, was named acting chief.Before the recent turmoil, more traditional banks were putting faith in the industrys underwriting models and low-cost lending system. The banks had been buying loans from the marketplace lenders and also forming partnerships.JPMorgan Chase, for example, started a partnership with OnDeck to offer small-business loans. JPMorgan, the nations largest bank, figured that OnDeck could offer the loans more cheaply and quickly than if the bank processed them internally.Some analysts predict that if the funding pressure continues, large banks could end up acquiring the marketplace lenders, or pieces of them.They have good technology and it could ultimately be adopted by the banks themselves, said Todd H. Baker, founder of Broadmoor Consulting, which advises financial services companies."}
{"text": "The Good Wife came to an end Sunday night much like it began  with a slap.But unlike the one seven seasons ago, this time the shows heroine, Alicia Florrick (played by Julianna Margulies), was on the receiving end. Instead of rebuking her philandering politician husband Peter Florrick, this time she was getting her comeuppance from her law partner and once-again ally, Diane Lockhart.That clever piece of symmetry underlined how much Alicia had changed during the intervening years. Perhaps she had learned all too well the shows recurring legal lesson  do almost anything in the zealous representation of ones client. She seemingly betrayed Diane to keep Peter from going to prison once again.On Monday, Robert and Michelle King, the husband-and-wife creators of The Good Wife, spoke about crafting the shows ending; the return of Alicias flame, Will Gardner; and not giving Alicias story a fairy-tale ending. Here are edited excerpts from the interview.When did you hit upon the idea of ending with the slap, and what was your storytelling goal with using it?MICHELLE KING That was very early.ROBERT KING We didnt think wed last past the first 13 episodes  we tend to be fairly cynical. The only thing we had in mind was that wed send Peter Florrick, the Chris Noth character, home from prison in the first year. You cant imagine the pleasure when you get picked up for the whole season. Thank you, Jay Leno, because thats who we were going against. So after that, Michelle and I were thinking out if we were telling this story as a story, and not just a going concern for CBS, what would it be? And thats when we thought the whole education of Alicia Florrick was about a woman who began with some navet, was kicked out of Eden in a way, and had to fend for herself. And in the process became more and more  corrupt is too big of a word  seasoned by cynicism and cunning.MICHELLE KING She becomes more sophisticated, with all the good things and bad things that word entails.ROBERT KING In our thinking, when we left the series, we knew wed create an ending that would create some symmetry from beginning to end. So the audience would know that mendacity and bad things are not just out there; youre not just victim of them, you perpetrate them yourself.It allowed us to write to something. When youre in the middle of these seasons, you need to always have your own first principle that you go back to. And our first principle was that you forgave Alicia for all these things she did over the years, but they do add up.Why did you decide to bring back Josh Charless character, Will Gardner, in the finale in several daydream sequences?ROBERT KING We felt there were these three men circling in her immediate thinking. There was her husband, Peter, who if you want to go all The Unbearable Lightness of Being, he was the weight. They had all this history together. And Jason, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was flightiness and lightness and passion. And then there was one new element, which was the unreality of the romance that cant happen again, and is therefore perfect in your mind. And that was the Will Gardner character.There was this feeling that Alicia had never given up her love for Will. She could make him whatever she wanted. Part of the triumph, if there is triumph at the end, is probably her needing to let go of that.MICHELLE KING The sense was she needed permission from the fantasy love to move on with her life, and she got it.Did you consider a happily ever after for Alicia? There was a lot of ambiguity at the end, whether its about her relationship with Jason or the future of the firm.ROBERT KING We had a big conversation in the writers room about two and half, three months ago. There is a lot of affection for Alicia and who she is, and the show has traded off that for a long while.MICHELLE KING To see her go off in the sunset with Jason was an option.ROBERT KING But I dont think it would have been good for the whole series. Even though romantic love is such an important part of the show, its not really what the show is about. The show is more about this one woman who moves into a position of power and what she has to give up and how she changes. The show is much more about power and how it is used. For some reason, it seemed to be off-topic.Some creators and showrunners decide not to talk after the final episode, preferring to let the work speak for itself. You two did a video for CBS, and are doing morning-after interviews like this one. Whats your thinking behind that?ROBERT KING CBS asked us. [Laughs.] They didnt want to leave the fans bereft? Michelle, is that wrong to say?MICHELLE KING No, its accurate. And by the way, its not something we pushed back on.ROBERT KING Look, Im much more of the person who believes the story tells itself. But CBS has been so generous to us and so nice, so hey."}

Some say they believe that the Nazi leader rejected Hess, who had a reputation for dogged loyalty, only after his peace bid failed.In a further twist, K.G.B. documents show that British intelligence might have lured Hess with false promises of a settlement.Well get a look at a few more pieces of the Hess flight puzzle next year when Britain is scheduled to unseal the archival material on his interrogations.Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated on the web all morning.What would you like to see here?

{"text": "Q. Rather than digging out dandelions in my lawn, I just pull off the flower heads and buds. Will this work?A. Common dandelions, or Taraxacum officinale, are born of a tenacious breed of plant, better equipped than most to survive and propagate, gardening authorities agree. The accepted wisdom is that removing the root system or using a broad-leaf herbicide are the only ways to defeat them.But the central root grows very deep, usually half a foot to 18 inches but sometimes 10 or 15 feet, and the temptation is to seek a shortcut. Pulling off flower heads, known to gardeners as deadheading, can encourage more shoots and buds, as it directs the plants resources from the developing flower and back to the infrastructure.In ornamental plants, deadheading is usually done after the flower has germinated and become unattractive, but the removal of flowers and buds at any time can have the same effect. With dandelions in particular, deadheading seems to only encourage a more vigorous growth of the crown of leaves growing concentrically around the top of the central root. New flower stalks soon follow. Even cutting off the entire crown at or below the soil level does not discourage the plant from regenerating and vigorously producing new shoots, stalks and flowers, if a mere inch of root is left behind. The plants can survive and grow for years.To frustrate weeders further, there are anecdotal reports that the pulled-off flowers can continue to produce viable seeds if picked at the right stage and left on the lawn. And it takes only a single winged seed from the compound flower, produced by one of the hundred or more segments of the mature dandelion flower, to produce the next dandelion. The seeds do not even have to be pollinated.The bottom line is that dandelion removal still requires radical surgery or chemical warfare. question@nytimes.com"}
{"text": "Q. My computers antivirus program is going nuts lately blocking something called Locky. What is this and why am I getting so many alerts about it?A. Locky is a type of malicious software known as ransomware, which as the name suggests, encrypts the files on your computer and will not release them until you give a hefty payment to your unseen attackers. Ransomware, which has been featured as a plot device on some television shows, has become decidedly more prevalent and large-scale in recent months, especially with attacks on hospitals in California and Kentucky, as well as on a municipal utility company in Michigan.Locky is aimed at Windows systems and has been spreading this spring through waves of phishing spam messages. The ransomware can arrive on your computer hidden in an email attachment, like an infected Microsoft Office document (one that prompts you to enable Office macros) or as a bit of JavaScript code tucked inside a .zip file. (Because it can better evade some antivirus programs, the JavaScript version has been increasingly widespread as of late.)You can take basic steps to protect yourself from ransomware infection. Keep your antivirus program and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches. Do not open any unsolicited file attachments from unknown senders  or even unexpected attachments from people you know, in case their computers have been compromised.Disable macro commands in Microsoft Office files you receive by email and if possible, log into your computer with a more limited standard account instead of the all-powerful administrator account. Some ransomware can encrypt files on drives attached to the PC, so back up your computers files regularly, and keep a copy of the backup on an unconnected external drive or server.Ransomware is not just a Windows problem. Mac users should also be on guard against the OS X/KeRanger-A ransomware and its variants, which can extort a high price in exchange for getting your computers files back."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  As the House and Senate return in full from a recess on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers may try to run  and some will  but they cannot hide from the question that is likely to dog them until Election Day: How do they solve a problem like Donald J. Trump?Republican members of Congress, guided by a complicated soup of regional interests, constituent pressure and inner moral voices, will be hard pressed to avoid taking a position on Mr. Trump now that he is their presumptive presidential nominee.While lawmakers were on recess last week, Mr. Trump seized control of the Republican Party after winning the Indiana primary and pushing his last rivals out of the race. But the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, has said he was not ready to endorse him, expressing concerns about his tone and values.Mr. Trump, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders on Thursday, returned the volley by refusing to rule out blocking Mr. Ryan from his role as chairman of the Republican convention.Mr. Trumps failed Republican challengers represent a gamut of views, from stony-faced support to silence to outright rejection. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida reflected some of the hesitation about Mr. Trump, writing on Facebook on Monday: I have never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice president. Instead, I will focus my attention on representing the people of Florida, retaining a conservative majority in the Senate and electing principled conservatives across the country.House Republican leaders are also fractured. While Mr. Ryan is withholding his support, the No. 2 House Republican, Kevin McCarthy of California, and the No. 3 Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, have backed Mr. Trump.In the Senate, many members have remained vague about where they stand, and there are divisions within states. In Nebraska, Senator Ben Sasse has repeatedly said he cannot support Mr. Trump and has called for a third-party candidate to step in. The senior senator from the state, Deb Fischer, said she would support Mr. Trump.I dont agree with his strategy, she said of Mr. Sasse. Im not going to hand this election to Hillary Clinton, and thats what a third candidate would do.Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior member of the House Republican conference, said he expected a majority of his fellow Republicans in Congress to eventually line up behind Mr. Trump with varying levels of enthusiasm, even though he might jeopardize the partys chances in some Senate and House races.You play this game with the cards youre dealt, Mr. Cole said. The G.O.P. primary electorate has dealt incumbents running for re-election Trump. In some districts, Trump will help. In some, he will hurt. In most, he will impact the margin rather than the outcome of the congressional race. Members know that and will react accordingly.He added: Republican members are far better prepared for the volatility and uncertainty of this election than they were in 2006 and 2008, when the Democrats seized control of Congress and the presidency. They are better organized, funded and positioned than they were, because most of them saw this coming. And most of them are battle tested.That does not mean that some are not deeply disturbed. Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, offered support of Mr. Trump on Monday with the enthusiasm of someone receiving a tetanus shot  it is necessary, in his view, but not pleasant.There are a lot of people in my state who have been asking me, Is this who we are?  Mr. Lankford said. I say yes."}
{"text": "VIENNA  Austrias chancellor resigned abruptly on Monday after seven and a half years in office, having lost control of his center-left Social Democratic Party amid a rightward shift fueled by anxiety over migration.The chancellor, Werner Faymann, initially supported the decision last year by Germanys chancellor, Angela Merkel, to welcome migrants fleeing war and poverty and to refuse to set a limit on how many might come. But after a ferocious backlash, Mr. Faymann switched course, joining his coalition partner, the center-right Austrian Peoples Party, in supporting border restrictions.The policy reversal was not enough to stop the right-wing Freedom Party, which has run on a strident Austrians First platform, from capitalizing on the influx of migrants. In September, the party finished second in regional elections in northern Austria.An even greater shock to the establishment occurred on April 24, when the Freedom Party candidate, Norbert Hofer, won the first round of the presidential election, capturing more than one-third of the vote. He will face a former Greens leader, Alexander Van der Bellen, in a May 22 runoff.The two establishment parties  which have governed for the past decade in a so-called grand coalition, a political constellation that has dominated postwar Austria  together received just 22 percent of the first-round vote. No matter who wins the second round, the next president will not be from either mainstream party, for the first time in decades.Although the position of president has been considered largely ceremonial, the two parties were thrown into a state of panic.Left-leaning Social Democrats, angered by Mr. Faymanns reversal on migration policy, rebelled. Things peaked at Viennas May Day celebrations  typically a day of strength for the party, which has governed in the Austrian capital since the end of World War II. Mr. Faymann was booed and heckled as party members held signs demanding his resignation.That set in motion a flurry of back-room meetings aimed  until now  at rescuing Mr. Faymann at least through the runoff, and possibly the summer. Those talks failed over the weekend, and Mr. Faymann, 56, bowed on Monday to political reality, saying he would step down as chancellor and as the partys leader.I am grateful that I was allowed to serve the country, Mr. Faymann said at a news conference in Vienna.Mr. Faymann said he was proud of his time in office, having guided Austrias recovery from the financial crisis while investing in education and research.We need to fight unemployment, guarantee social cohesion and, in the refugee crisis, ensure order and humanity, Mr. Faymann said. The question was thus: Did I have the full support of a strong backing from the party? I have to answer in the negative. The majority is not enough. However, I want to thank all colleagues who have stood with me in these days.Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner of the Austrian Peoples Party will serve as interim chancellor, said Astrid Salmhofer, a spokeswoman for President Heinz Fischer.Under Austrias Constitution, Mr. Mitterlehner could remain in office for days, weeks or even months, Ms. Salmhofer said. Parliamentary elections are not expected until 2018, though an early election is now likely.Michael Hupl, the veteran mayor of Vienna, who won a tight race last year with a pro-immigrant stance, will take over as the temporary leader of the Social Democrats, but a fierce contest for leadership of the party has already begun.Among the challenges facing Austria is the integration of about 90,000 refugees and migrants who applied for asylum last year, as hundreds of thousands more traveled through Austria on their way to Germany and Scandinavia.The Freedom Partys nationalist and anti-Islam message seems to have struck a chord even in Vienna, with its history as the cosmopolitan former capital of the multiethnic and multilingual Austro-Hungarian Empire, and  from 1918 onward  as Red Vienna, where workers fought street battles to resist the rise of Nazism, in contrast to the crowds who cheered Hitler when he annexed Austria in 1938.In 1999 elections, the party finished second, and its populist leader, Jrg Haider, was eventually invited to join a government coalition by Wolfgang Schssel, the leader of the Peoples Party at the time. That prompted European partners, above all France, to effectively boycott Austria, much as foreign powers did after Austrians elected Kurt Waldheim president in 1986 despite revelations that Mr. Waldheim, a former United Nations secretary general, had been attached to German military units in World War II that committed atrocities in the Balkans.Mr. Haider eventually lost power, and the Freedom Party split; he died in a car crash in 2008. But the party never went away, and it has enjoyed a surge of support as tensions over migration have grown."}
{"text": "SEATTLE  The coal industry, shaken by dropping global demand and tighter air quality regulations, took another major hit on Monday when the United States Army Corps of Engineers said it would deny the permit for what could have been nations largest coal export terminal here in Washington.The $665 million project, called the Gateway Pacific Terminal, was already hitting headwinds. The developer asked last month that the state environmental review on the project be delayed, citing uncertainty and related costs. And one of the largest potential suppliers of coal, Peabody Energy, filed for bankruptcy protection last month.But in the end, the decision came down to fish.The Lummi Nation of American Indians had said the terminal, about 90 miles north of Seattle, would threaten the tribes ancestral fishing rights, which are legally protected by treaties dating to the mid-1800s. Spills or maritime accidents, the tribe said, could permanently destroy fishing beds.In its decision, the corps agreed, saying the developers plan to extend docks across 144 acres over the water could have restricted access to the water by the tribe. That concern was enough to stop the terminal, corps officials said, without even considering potential environmental harm.The corps may not permit a project that abrogates treaty rights, said Col. John G. Buck, the corps Seattle District commander, in a telephone news conference. The project, Colonel Buck said, is not permittable.The chairman of the Lummi Indian Business Council, Timothy Ballew II, called the decision a win for the treaty, a win for the Constitution and a win for all of Indian country. He added, The ancestral sites will be protected.But a spokesman for the project called the corps decision inconceivable.Looking at the set of facts in the administrative summary, its quite obvious this is a political decision and not fact-based, Bob Watters, the president of Pacific International Terminals, the Gateway proposals developer, said in a statement.Environmental concerns about energy transport through the Northwest  both coal and oil  have grown in recent years as projects like the Gateway Pacific Terminal were put forward. Municipal leaders in cities from Spokane to Seattle said trains carrying coal from mines in Montana and Wyoming, or oil from North Dakota, posed risks: air pollution caused by dust, traffic congestion caused by mile-long trains and the potential catastrophe of derailments in urban areas.But the economics of the market have spoken just as loudly.Arch Coal, which was part of a team backing a big coal-export terminal on the Columbia River, filed for bankruptcy in January. A liquefied natural gas project proposed in Oregon was shelved last month, as was a methanol refinery plant in Tacoma, near Seattle. Mr. Watters said in his statement that the Gateway Pacific developers were considering all action alternatives."}
{"text": "Ramn Carln, a Mexican washing-machine magnate who was a 50-year-old sailboat skipper of scant experience when he entered  and unaccountably won  the first Whitbread Round the World Race, a Mother Nature- and death-defying competition of more than seven months and 27,000 nautical miles across storm-tossed and near-frozen seas, died on Thursday in Mexico City. He was 92.His death was confirmed by his son Enrique.Seventeen yachts of varying styles and dimensions set out from Portsmouth, England, on Sept. 8, 1973, for the first Whitbread competition, a much-ballyhooed regatta often called the first fully crewed sailing race to circumnavigate the globe. (Two other boats joined the competition for separate legs later on.)The race, now known as the Volvo Ocean Race and last held in 2014-15, was something of a novelty in its first incarnation; some 3,000 spectator boats followed the contestants out of Portsmouth harbor, and the captains and crews had varying levels of experience. But crews trained by the British Navy as well as some of Europes most accomplished sailors, including Chay Blyth, a Scotsman (now known as Sir Charles Blyth), who had previously sailed around the world solo, took part.Certainly Mr. Carlns Swan 65 yacht, a 65-foot fiberglass craft christened Sayula II and purchased specifically for the race, was viewed as an inevitable also-ran. Before the start, British newspapers ridiculed the idea of a Mexican yachting crew; at least one cartoon depicted a boatful of clownish, tequila-swilling sombrero-wearers under patched sails.Mr. Carlns quest did, in fact, seem quixotic. He had begun recreational sailing just two years earlier. His crew, which included family members (his wife was the cook on the first leg of the journey) mixed in with a few experienced salts, were barely acquainted as the race began.According to a new documentary about the race, The Weekend Sailor, he had sent his son Enrique, then a teenager, to school in Ireland to divert his interest in marrying his under-age girlfriend and was visiting him when he saw an advertisement for the race. Hed been a casual sailor for only a couple of years and didnt own a boat capable of such a journey.My father asked, Hey, shall we go around the world? Enrique Carln told the filmmakers. And I said, Sure, no problem. (Enrique would eventually marry the young woman anyway, and some 40 years later they are still together.)Ramn Carln (pronounced car-LEEN) recalled: When I registered in the race, they asked me what kind of boat I had. I told them I didnt have one, but they could be sure Id be there when the regatta started. He added: Since I had almost no experience, I turned to friends. I asked them to recommend a boat for sailing around the world.That first Whitbread race was conducted in four legs, the winner of each determined by corrected time  that is, actual sailing time minus a handicap factor that is determined by the boats dimensions and aspects of its construction  and the winner of the race by accumulated corrected time. The first leg, from Portsmouth to Cape Town, may have been the easiest, though one sailor on a British boat was swept overboard in a fierce squall; he was later rescued.During the second leg  from Cape Town, through raucous seas whipped up by rocketing winds known as the Roaring Forties, to Sydney, Australia  all the boats were savagely battered. Sayula, hit with a mammoth wave, capsized and nearly sank; its crew members were pitched into the sea, but fortunately they were all attached to the boat by safety harnesses, managed to clamber back aboard and survived. In spite of the near tragedy  two sailors on other boats were not as lucky  Sayula won the second leg on corrected time, the only leg in which it finished first.A third sailor  Bernie Hosking, the same man who had earlier been swept overboard and rescued  was lost from Captain Blyths boat, Great Britain II, on the third leg, which took the racers from Sydney across the frigid Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, around Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America and up the coast to Rio de Janeiro. Rounding the fierce promontory of the Cape, where the hazards include gale-force winds, sleetlike rain and a minefield of icebergs, sailors face some of the most treacherous waters in the world. According to a history of the race on the races website, up to that time fewer than 10 sporting yachts had endured the journey.On the fourth leg, from Rio across the Atlantic back to Portsmouth, several boats, including Sayula, were hampered by becalmed winds. The start of the final leg had a staggered start  the larger, more powerful boats started later  so they would arrive at the finish more or less together. Fourteen boats completed the race. Sayulas time, 155 days 9 hours, became a corrected time of 133 days 13 hours, nearly two days faster than the runner-up.The winning difference was my boat and that crew, Mr. Carln said afterward. We had no time to train. My plan was to get to know the crew and teach them how to manage the boat during the first leg, but all of them turned out to be very good.Ramn Carln Lima was born on Aug. 31, 1923, in Puebla, east of Mexico City, where he spent most of his life. Though his mother, Magdalena Lima, was a teacher, he never finished high school; he moved to Mexico City in his midteens and worked in a soap factory after the death of his father, Moises Carln, who had run a grocery in Puebla.In the late 1940s, he was selling household goods  cookware, glasses, small appliances  door to door, and in 1960 he founded a highly profitable company, Comercial Domstica, that sold washing machines and other home appliances.Mr. Carlns first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his son Enrique, his survivors include his wife, Francisca Larios; another son, Octavio; six daughters, Mara Teresa, Gloria, Alicia, Emma, Marta and Lourdes; 19 grandchildren; and 22 great-grandchildren.Mr. Carln may have been an unlikely adventurer, but by the early 1970s he was nonetheless seeking an adventure. And though his seagoing experience was minimal, his leadership instincts and skills were not. He made sure that the crew had creature comforts: The boat was fitted out with proper berths, a bar and a galley, and supplied with food and drink far more appealing than normal sea rations.He was enthusiastic; he did everything in a first-class way, Bob Martin, an American who served on the crew, said in an appreciation of Mr. Carln published on the race website after his death. He cared about us, we had the best food and the boat was beautifully equipped.The veteran sailors on the crew also gave him credit for delegating properly, keeping his cool and being willing to perform the rudimentary but necessary tasks that many captains find beneath them.If someone was sick, he would take his night watch, said a British crewman, Butch Dalrymple-Smith.He would dry our wet gear if we forgot to do it. Others would scream. He just wasnt like that. Everything that made the difference between success and failure can be traced back to Ramn.Mr. Carln was a perfect skipper, really, Mr. Dalrymple-Smith added."}

The shows producers announced that the Grammy Award-winning singer Rhiannon Giddens will make her Broadway debut as Ms. McDonalds replacement.Savion Glover, the shows Tony-nominated choreographer, will also join the cast in a capacity still to be determined by the director, George C. Wolfe, according to a spokesman for the show.Ms. McDonalds pregnancy means that she will postpone her West End debut in a reprisal of her Tony-winning role in Lady Day at Emersons Bar and Grill, which was set to begin performances in June. (Her three-month hiatus from Shuffle Along to perform in London was announced before Shuffle Along opened.)Her return date to the show, a jazz-and-tap-heavy show about a 1921 all-black Broadway musical, was not announced, although a news release said she would be back this winter.This will be Ms. McDonalds first child with her husband, the actor Will Swenson, although they have three children from previous marriages. In a statement Ms. McDonald said she was disappointed to postpone Lady Day and temporarily leave Shuffle Along, but was looking forward to setting up a 1920s-themed nursery in my dressing room when I return to the show.Ms. Giddens, a singer and musician, will make her Broadway debut. She is best known as the leader of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a band that aims to preserve the tradition of African-American string bands of the early 20th century, roughly the era depicted in Shuffle Along. Her solo album, Tomorrow Is My Turn, was released in February. In a review in The New York Times earlier this year, Stephen Holden said that Ms. Giddens possessed a beautiful voice and air of supernal calm.Shuffle Along was nominated for 10 Tony Awards last week, including best musical. Ms. McDonald, who has a record six Tony Awards, did not receive a nomination."}

Many women are opting out of top jobs like these.I have talked to hundreds of them over the past few years at the marketing workshops I teach. They dont want to be the one where the buck stops, the one who has to work all weekend and fire half the agency when you lose the big account. They would rather be a highly paid second in command and have more time with their families.It is certainly their right to make such a decision. But then they should stop moaning about male dominance.

I answered that I didnt really think so. A few days later I saw your article.After graduating from Rhode Island School of Design, I was unable to find a job in an art department of an advertising agency. (I staunchly refused to become a secretary!) I was given a variety of excuses, but the best was from a senior partner of a prestigious agency who said it never hired girls because the boys in the bullpen wouldnt want to swear in front of a girl and therefore their work might suffer.

The word discrimination had yet to enter my mind.Years later, despite all the bluster to the contrary, demeaning and dismissive attitudes havent changed very much; theyve just been sublimated.I wish the best for Susan Credle, Nancy Hill and all the other women in advertising you profiled and hope that they persevere, hang tough and continue to make their mark.MARCIA GLOSTER AMMEENVerona, N.J."}
{"text": "LONDON  A former investment banker and a businessman were convicted of insider trading on Monday in what the British authorities have described as the largest crackdown on improper trading in Britain.After a three-month trial in Southwark Crown Court in London, Martyn Dodgson, a former banker at Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank, and Andrew Hind, a businessman and trained accountant, were convicted of conspiracy to insider deal, as insider trading is described in Britain.The conspiracy began in November 2006 and ended in March 2010, prosecutors said.The case sprung out of an investigation called Operation Tabernula. The investigation began with a series of raids by the British authorities in March 2010Three other men who also were on trial were acquitted of criminal charges on Monday.This was an extraordinary and complex case of a type not prosecuted in this country before, Mark Steward, the Financial Conduct Authoritys director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a news release on Monday.The message is loud and clear that the F.C.A. will not tolerate sophisticated predatory criminals abusing our markets, he added.Sentencing of Mr. Dodgson, 44, and Mr. Hind, 56, will be at a later date. The maximum sentence for each is seven years in prison.The Financial Conduct Authority accused Mr. Dodgson of improperly sharing information from the investment banks where he worked to be used to make improper trades.Mr. Dodgson shared the information with Mr. Hind, his close friend, the regulator said. Mr. Hind acted as a middle man and helped facilitate trades for the benefit of Mr. Dodgson and himself, the Financial Conduct Authority said.The members of the conspiracy used unregistered mobile telephones, encrypted records and safe deposit boxes to hide their improper trading from authorities, the Financial Conduct Authority said.The tips included inside information about Paragon Group, Legal & General and BSkyB, the regulator said.Five people in total have pleaded guilty or been convicted of criminal charges in the matter.The other three, who pleaded guilty, are Julian Rifat, a former senior execution trader at Moore Capital Management; Graeme Shelley, a former broker at Novum Securities; and Paul Milsom, a former senior trader at Legal & General."}
{"text": "WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  One of the many ways that you know youre on track to become a crossword puzzle constructor is when you come across an interesting word or phrase and automatically start counting off letters to see if it will fit in a daily or Sunday-size puzzle grid. Long ago, my kids got used to seeing me counting on my fingers; they were thankful when they learned that I was working and that it wasnt just another embarrassing Mom tic. Eventually I learned to stop moving my lips, too.I bring this up because Pawel Fludzinski mentions the inspiration for his midweek theme as the quotes from an art fair. The joke, which takes a series of sort-of quotes from noted people and lands it with Frank Sinatra warbling DOOBY DOOBY DO, was brought to the forefront in Kurt Vonneguts novel Deadeye Dick, which mentioned it as a graffito, but which actually goes back further than that. You can read more about the history of this joke here.The quip as I heard it was as follows:To be is to do.  Socrates\nTo do is to be.  Sartre\nDo be do be do.  SinatraWilliam Shakespeares contribution is certainly on point and helps Mr. Fludzinski add to his theme material letter count.The spelling of Sinatras punchline is apparently variable, but I ran into a speed bump when I tried to make DOO BE DOO BE DOO work. It didnt occur to me that the DOOBY might be spelled that way, and it took me a lot longer to finish the puzzle for that reason. I was helped by the realization that, in the entire history of the Mattel Corporations Hot Wheels brand, it has never, in fact, made a TOE CAR. At least, I dont think it has. But those Ys threw me off.Setting the spelling aside, I really liked the theme and it made me smile. Mr. Fludzinski sets us up in his 72-word grid for some nice longer entries like DEAR SANTA, CIABATTA (yum!), RARE BOOK, SIDE DOOR, ISOTOPE and EYEHOLES. I also liked CALLSIGNS and got the concept right away, but I wanted it to be CALL LETTERS, which doesnt fit.The middle of the week is when you start to see more wordplay, vaguer cluing and requests for specific knowledge, so buckle your seatbelts, beginners. Once you have grasped the language of crosswords, you will be able to fill in more and more of these midweek puzzles. 1As Parks who sparked a boycott is not talking about public parks. Its talking about ROSA Parks. There are quite a few cities in central Iowa, but how are you supposed to know that 5A is AMES? You have a few choices. You could look it up. You could guess. You could be from AMES and know it just because, or you could rely on the particularly kind crossings to get the answer. Just dont give up and say, I cant do this because Im not geographically familiar with the state of Iowa. There are many ways to solve a puzzle. Get to know the battle of ST. LO (9D). Just do it, and commit it to memory. Youll thank me, because it comes up a lot. Ditto for James AGEE at 59A. Sometimes youll see AGEE clued as Mets player Tommie. It was once clued in The New York Times crossword as the writer Jon AGEE. Constructors are waiting with bated breath for another famous AGEE to appear so they can change things up a bit.Lets hear from Mr. Fludzinski:Last fall, while at an art fair, I ran across these Shakespeare, Socrates, Sartre and Sinatra quotes twice in one day.By the second time, I realized that the number of letters in the phrases matched  and a possible theme was born. I suspect that, like most crossword constructors, we observe things around us through a unique lens of letter counts, interesting words and other mysteries of the language.Of course, Will and Joel greatly improved my clues, changing about half of them and tweaking the grammar in a handful more.  I originally assumed this puzzle would appear on a Monday (perhaps Tuesday) if accepted, so their editorial assistance tightened the consistency of the degree-of-difficulty of the clues.  As a still relatively inexperienced constructor, I find setting the right tone for clues one of the more challenging aspects of construction.  I often get enamored of a possible clue, without fully appreciating whether or not it is appropriate for a given puzzle.In the end, I hope solvers share the same moment of amusement from the theme that I did when I ran across it (twice!) last fall.This was definitely an amusing outing to lead us into our later week puzzles.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "If youre playing a game of word association, and someone mutters the phrase fried chicken, it is probably unlikely that the next word you will blurt out is Germany.But Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, the two chefs behind Prime Meats, a seven-year-old spot in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, that specializes in carefully executed beer-hall fare such as schnitzel, sausage and spaetzle, are determined to change your mental reflexes.For a few months now, the Germanish restaurant has been serving a $36 menu item identified only as crispy Guinea hen. Unless you grew up in a region of the country settled by German immigrants, you may be inclined to skip over that menu item. Doing so would be a mistake. The dish, a half-bird that comes to the table crackly from hot oil and slathered with what the two men describe as a chicken-skin caramel, takes its place as a curveball rival to fried-chicken contenders, even those hailing from Tennessee and South Korea.The idea for the dish emerged last summer when Mr. Castronovo took a family trip to Berlin. While there, he asked people for restaurant recommendations. He was urged to go to a place referred to simply as Henne, meaning hen, and instructed to get the signature dish. He did so. The hen was out of this world, he recalled. I couldnt believe it. I was like, This has got to go on our menu.Yet trying to replicate that Berlin specialty turned out to be a challenge back in Brooklyn. The two Franks spent weeks testing out different techniques and birds. The simplest thing in the world sometimes takes the most work, Mr. Castronovo said.Eventually they settled on a juicy Guinea hen from DArtagnan that is crisped up in a bath of oil (without any batter or coating) before being strafed, as it comes out of the fryer, with a rust-colored spice mix that includes paprika, cumin, Aleppo pepper and sugar. The mix sticks to the bird, going all melty and gooey on contact.Some customers expressed a tang of puzzled resistance, at first. Now they do not hesitate to order the hen and tear into it with their fingers. Regardless of its origins, fried chicken always plays well with others. As Mr. Castronovo said, It goes great with a beer and a bratwurst."}
{"text": "There are many apps, classes and books to guide children in meditation, but it is easy (and free) to start at home. You dont need props like chimes or incense. The more meditation becomes integrated into daily living, the more successful it will be. Here are some exercises to try.1. Elevator down. Imagine an elevator going down three floors. (Older children may prefer to imagine more floors.) Imagine now that the elevator is in your body. When you are sitting, imagine the top floor is from your head to your chest. The next floor is from your chest to your belly, and the third from your belly to your seat.Begin at the crown of your head. On your next exhale mentally chant three as you imagine the elevator lowering from your crown to your chest. Pause for an inhale. When the doors open, imagine your breath coming in and freshening up the elevator, the way opening a window brings a fresh breeze into the room. On the next exhale, mentally chant two. Imagine going down another flight to your belly. Continue to the ground floor, chanting one. Pause and feel your seat on the ground floor and enjoy landing fully.2. Finger-counting breaths. This is a useful do-anywhere exercise for the middle of the day to calm a child who is having a meltdown at a birthday party or just to re-center.  Create gentle fists with your hands, and with each breath, unfurl a finger from your palm. For example, on your first exhale open your left thumb from your fist. Pause and enjoy an inhale. On your next exhale, unfurl your left index finger. Pause and enjoy an inhale. Continue until you have two open palms on your lap.Sometimes we om for each finger unfurled, or use a personal mantra that evokes the feeling we are looking for, like peace, love, quiet, calm or relax. When children make up the mantra, it helps them have self-awareness of what they may need, as well as how they can take charge of how they want to feel.3. Deep breaths before bed. Take a deep breath in through the nose, and on the exhale chant out loud: three (thrreee). Enjoy another deep in-breath, and on the next exhale, chant two (twwooo). Take a last deep breath in and exhale, chanting:  one (onnee). Relax for a few breaths, and enjoy feeling your body sitting or lying on the floor or your bed. Repeat if desired.To learn why meditation can be so important for children, read The Mindful Child.Jillian Pransky is the director of therapeutic yoga teacher training for YogaWorks and the mother of a 12-year-old.

{"text": "Occasional music seldom outlives the occasion it commemorates, except when, say, a Handel work is involved, as with the Music for the Royal Fireworks or many another toss-off. Alessandro Scarlattis grand serenata La Gloria di Primavera (The Glory of Spring)  which the San Francisco-based Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, led by its music director, Nicholas McGegan, presented at Zankel Hall on Friday evening  is a fascinating case study.It harks back to 1713, when the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI savored a moment filled with hope. Peace seemed a real possibility, with the first in a series of treaties that would end the 13-year War of the Spanish Succession and leave Charles with substantial gains, including Italian territories (though not Spain). What is more, Charless wait for a male heir had just ended with the birth of Archduke Leopold in April 1713.But it was just a moment. The infant Leopold died in November, and no male heir followed. Charles died in 1740, having arranged as best he could for his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed him as head of the Habsburg line, but strife again ensued: the War of the Austrian Succession and other conflicts.After the birth in 1713, with the kingdom of Naples now part of Charless realm, it behooved the Neapolitan Prince Nicola Gaetani dellAquila dAragona and his wife, Aurora Sanseverino, to curry favor, so they commissioned a celebratory sonata from their court composer, Alessandro Scarlatti. Scarlatti  the father of Domenico Scarlatti, known for his hundreds of keyboard sonatas  was an astonishingly prolific composer of opera and vocal music, and he produced La Gloria in little more than a month.A lively but overlong and unevenly inspired creation, it posits a contest among the four seasons to receive credit from Jove for the birth of the archduke. Its 58 numbers run some two hours, an almost constant alternation between recitative and aria. The libretto, by the Abbate Nicolo Giovo, Princess Auroras secretary, is highly repetitive in welcoming peaceable times and the imperial birth in terms that, with hindsight, can only seem poignantly deluded: May his victories be as many as his days.Ecstatically received at its premiere, La Gloria was performed twice more. But thereafter, according to the program note, the work has been neither edited nor performed until now, as a feature of the orchestras 2015-16 season. In booklet notes from a recording of the work made by Philharmonia Baroque in October, however, the same writer cites a report that it was performed in Vienna amid loud applause, on Dec. 26, 1825, the 100th anniversary of the composers death.Whatever the case and whatever the works ultimate merits, it is good to have it in circulation. The Zankel performance featured the same fine vocal soloists heard on the recording: Diana Moore as Spring, Suzana Ograjensek as Summer, Clint van der Linde as Autumn, Nicholas Phan as Winter and Douglas Williams as Jove.The tenor Mr. Phan, in particular, is becoming a star of the American early-music scene, a status that Philharmonia Baroque has long enjoyed."}
{"text": "Ever since Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park opened on Roosevelt Island four years ago, City Hall has been arguing with the nonprofit group that built and runs the park over whether it is fully accessible to disabled people.The little-known dispute has now reached an impasse, with the de Blasio administration declaring categorically that the park is not accessible and needs to be fixed.President Roosevelt himself would have been unable to use a 12-by-60-foot sunken terrace at the southernmost end of the memorial. He was paralyzed from the waist down and depended on a wheelchair for mobility.There is a particularly tragic irony in a park commemorating the legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt  one of this countrys great historical figures with a disability, and a role model to so many  that is not completely accessible to those with disabilities, said Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.Though the park is open and operating, the city is withholding a permanent certificate of occupancy and hundreds of thousands of dollars in financing until the matter is resolved.Board members of the Four Freedoms Park Conservancy said that the sunken terrace was a design device created to enhance the views from an open-air enclosure known as the Room, and that those views could be enjoyed by anyone in a wheelchair or motor scooter.From that vantage point, the individual has full access to the visual experience intended by architect Louis Kahn, the conservancy said in a 2014 analysis.The Room has granite walls on three sides. In place of a fourth wall is an uninterrupted vista of the East River. This barrier-free illusion is made possible by the sunken terrace beyond, called a ha-ha for the jolt of pleasant surprise it induces.The ha-ha is like an invisible fence, ensuring that no one can fall or jump from the Room into the river. Though it can be reached by steps on either side of the Room, the sunken terrace was not intended by Mr. Kahn to be a destination itself, said James Stewart Polshek, a conservancy board member who studied under Mr. Kahn.You feel like youre in a pit, Mr. Polshek said.Mr. Kahn, one of the most influential American architects of the 20th century, designed the park shortly before his death in 1974. That was long before the Americans With Disabilities Act took effect, prohibiting discrimination in any public accommodation on the basis of disability. But construction of the park did not begin until 2010, long after the act was enforced.Both the conservancy and City Hall say their positions are supported by the law. It seems possible to interpret the welter of complex accessibility regulations under the federal act either way.The remedy favored by the de Blasio administration would be to install ramps on either side of the Room.Sally Minard, the president and chief executive of the conservancy, said the use of ramps had been thoroughly explored. But it would present its own drawbacks.Railings would have to be installed along the ramps and behind benches that are now sheer slabs of Mount Airy granite, set off against monumental blocks of the same whitish-gray stone. This would compromise the Kahn design, which the conservancy tried to follow as faithfully as possible.The consequences of doing it  for everyones experience  seemed to outweigh the value, Ms. Minard said. The decision was not seen as a problem because we believed then, as we do now, that the park more than meets the requirements for accessibility for those with a disability, and that the memorial as a whole is A.D.A. compliant.She said that the conservancy was prepared to continue operating as it does now, under a temporary certificate of occupancy, while acknowledging that the missing financing from the city is meaningful. (City Hall puts the figure at $900,000, the conservancy at $600,000.)It is unclear at the moment how or when the issue will be resolved. For the time being, the lowest level of the ha-ha is closed to everyone.At least one advocacy group, the Roosevelt Island Disabled Association, supports the conservancys viewpoint. The conservancy has helped guide and finance the associations own project on the island, the F.D.R. Hope Memorial, which features a sculpture of President Roosevelt in a wheelchair.Jim Bates, the president of the association, who uses a wheelchair and motor scooter, said there is a better view from the Room above than there is from the ha-ha below because of a wide parapet wall at the end of the sunken terrace.The upper level is ideal, Mr. Bates said. You can see everything.The Kahn design had already been modified in subtle ways to improve accessibility, Ms. Minard said.Loose gravel, a difficult surface for wheelchairs and motor scooters, was originally specified for two alles. Instead, the conservancy installed a polypropylene honeycomb grid of two-inch hexagonal voids filled by gravel clusters held together by resin. It also raised the level of the cement and gravel fill between the 4-by-4-inch granite pavers in the promenades on either side of the island to offer a smoother ride for those on wheels.Ms. Minard said both modifications had been made in consultation with Victor Calise, the commissioner of the Mayors Office for People With Disabilities.Accessibility has generally improved at the south end of the island because of the memorial, Mr. Bates said. It had been rutted parkland before  hostile terrain for a scooter. I probably got stuck three or four times going into that area, he said."}
{"text": "The warm-weather television landscape isnt as bleak as it once was, but it still includes a fair amount of filler, a description that fits USAs First Impressions, which begins on Tuesday night.This is a competition show for impressionists, which means that it invests a lot in a comedic art form that has never ranked high on the prestige meter. It also has none of the high drama of big-ticket competition shows like American Idol and Dancing With the Stars. This is a series for viewers who want a mental break after a stretch of intense spring finales.Two genial men anchor the proceedings: Freddie Prinze Jr. as host and Dana Carvey as expert in residence, as the shows publicity puts it. In each episode Mr. Carvey is joined by a second celebrity  its Steve Carell in the premiere, and later episodes have Jay Leno, Jon Lovitz and Yvette Nicole Brown.Mr. Carvey and the guest hurl challenges at three impressionists (who are not household names) and comment on their performances. A $10,000 prize is at stake, but it seems an afterthought; the main attraction is seeing three hopefuls test their skills in front of Mr. Carvey, who of course knows something about impersonations. Mostly, the contestants employ impressions theyve already honed, but things liven up a bit in a speed round in which they draw names from a bowl and have to come up with an impersonation instantly.As this series continues it will be interesting to track just what constitutes an impersonation-worthy level of fame these days. In a fractured pop-culture landscape, many stars are not universally recognizable. National politicians have more fame, and by the end of the First Impressions premiere, the contestants have already blown through impersonations of Donald J. Trump and Sarah Palin. Lots of actors also are impersonated in the premiere  Al Pacino, Daniel Radcliffe, Christopher Walken  and you may wonder which ones will be left if the show runs for a while."}
{"text": "Facebook scrambled on Monday to respond to a new and startling line of attack: accusations of political bias.The outcry was set off by a report on Monday morning by the website Gizmodo, which said that Facebooks team in charge of the sites trending list had intentionally suppressed articles from conservative news sources. The social network uses the trending feature to indicate the most popular news articles of the day to users.Facebook denied the allegations after a backlash  from both conservative and liberal critics  erupted. It is beyond disturbing to learn that this power is being used to silence viewpoints and stories that dont fit someone elses agenda, read a statement from the Republican National Committee. NOT LEANING IN LEANING LEFT! blared the top story on The Drudge Report, a widely read website.The journalist Glenn Greenwald, hardly a conservative ally, weighed in on Twitter: Aside from fueling right-wing persecution, this is a key reminder of dangers of Silicon Valley controlling content. And Alexander Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart News, a conservative-leaning publication, said the report confirmed what conservatives have long suspected.Facebook, in response, says that it follows rigorous guidelines to ensure consistency and neutrality and that it works to be inclusive of all perspectives. We take allegations of bias very seriously, a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum.The back-and-forth highlights the extent to which Facebook has now muscled its way into Americas political conversation  and the risks that the company faces as it becomes a central force in news consumption and production.With more than 222 million monthly active users in the United States and Canada, the site has become a place that people flock to to find out what is going on. Last year, a study by the Pew Research Center, in collaboration with the Knight Foundation, found that 63 percent of Facebooks users considered the service a news source.In April, Facebook embraced this role openly, releasing a video to implore people to search Facebook to discover the other side of the story. Politicians have increasingly shared their messages through the social network.Its not that Facebook has changed fundamentally over the past four, eight years, said Paul Brewer, director of the University of Delaware Center for Political Communication. Its the sheer volume of communication thats taking place, and its that politicians know that they need to be using Facebook now more than ever before to communicate.As it has become more influential, Facebook has taken pains to say that it is not an echo chamber of similar opinions. In a peer-reviewed study published last year, Facebooks data scientists analyzed how 10.1 million of the most partisan American users on the social network navigated the site over a six-month period. They found that peoples networks of friends and the articles they saw were skewed toward their ideological preferences  but that the effect was more limited than the worst case some theorists had predicted, in which people would see almost no information from the other side.Yet Gizmodos report raises questions about the effects that Facebooks staff members and their biases  even unconscious ones  have on the social network.While Facebook has pledged to sponsor both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, the companys top executives have not been shy about expressing where their political sympathies lie.At a Facebook conference in April, Mark Zuckerberg, the companys chief executive, warned of fearful voices building walls, in reference to Donald Trump, the probable Republican presidential candidate.The allegations against Facebook also put the spotlight on how it chooses which news articles to show users under the trending function  on desktop computers, trending displays on the right side of screens; on cellphones, it appears when users search.Facebook has long described its trending feature as largely automatic. The topics you see are based on a number of factors including engagement, timeliness, pages youve liked and your location, according to a description on Facebooks site.The trending feature is curated by a team of contract employees, according to two former Facebook employees who worked on it and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements. They said they considered themselves members of a newsroom-like operation, where editorial discretion was not novel but was an integral part of the process.Any suppression, the former employees said, was based on perceived credibility  any articles judged by curators to be unreliable or poorly sourced, whether left-leaning or right-leaning, were avoided, though this was a personal judgment call.The perception of Facebook as a more conventional news operation opens it to a more familiar line of criticism, which has been mounted against news organizations left and right, large and small, for decades. According to a report last year by Pew, only 17 percent surveyed said that technology companies had a negative influence on the country. For the news media, that number was 65 percent  and rising.The agenda-setting power of a handful of companies like Facebook and Twitter should not be underestimated, said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of computer science and law at Harvard University. These services will be at their best when they are explicitly committed to serving the interests of their users rather than simply offering a service whose boundaries for influence are unknown and ever-changing.By late Monday, users on the social network looking for more information about the Gizmodo report did not have to look far: It was among the top articles trending on Facebook."}

{"text": "NEWPORT, Vt.  Jo-Ann Brooks grimaced as she looked out the window of her jewelry store in this tiny town in northern Vermont, near the Canadian border. Across Main Street, an entire block of shops and apartments was razed more than a year ago in the expectation of a new renaissance development that has yet to materialize. In its place is a gaping hole, with old concrete cellars.We call it Little Beirut, Ms. Brooks said. It looks like it was bombed.The hole is a visual monument to the failed plans of two ambitious businessmen who vowed to revitalize this struggling region, known as the Northeast Kingdom. With an $850 million dream, they promised the biggest economic development in Vermont history. They planned to finance it through a federal program that allows wealthy foreign citizens to invest $500,000 in projects in distressed areas in return for green cards, leading to permanent residency in the United States.Instead, the two have been accused of perpetrating the biggest fraud in Vermont history  as well as in the history of that federal visa program, known as EB-5.The businessmen, Ariel Quiros and William Stenger, raised $350 million through the EB-5 program from hundreds of foreign investors from at least 74 countries. The money was intended for an array of projects, including a ski resort, hotels and a biotech research firm. Instead, according to a 52-count civil complaint filed last month by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and a 15-count civil complaint filed by the State of Vermont, they engineered a massive eight-year fraudulent scheme in which they systematically looted millions of dollars out of the foreign investors.The complaints said the two used a Ponzi-like scheme to divert $200 million intended for future projects into a dizzying swirl of fraudulent accounts set up to try to keep earlier projects afloat. Some were completed, others were not. In addition, Mr. Quiros was accused of siphoning off $50 million for his personal use, which included buying a luxury condominium in Trump Place New York.The S.E.C. said the two left a trail of debt. Their actions have jeopardized the immigration status of their investors, who are already in the United States, and have thrown into doubt the future of the visa program. And they have left the promise of a revitalized Newport unfulfilled, having failed to rebuild the renaissance block on Main Street, the biotech firm and a hotel, marina and conference center.Beyond that, the states top officials, including Senators Patrick J. Leahy and Bernie Sanders and Gov. Peter Shumlin, supported and promoted the program. Mr. Leahy and Mr. Shumlin have said they felt betrayed; Mr. Sanders has not commented.In court papers, Mr. Quiros, 58, of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Mr. Stenger, 66, of Newport, denied the allegations. And in an interview, Mr. Stenger defended the work that has been finished, like parts of a high-end ski resort at nearby Jay Peak, and expressed regret about what remains unfinished, notably the biotech firm. A federal court has appointed a receiver to take possession of all property and assets, which he may sell off.The allegations against Mr. Stenger particularly stung people here because they had known him for decades as a friend and civic-minded neighbor. He was not accused of siphoning money for his personal use, but the S.E.C. said he extremely recklessly ceded control of investor funds to Quiros and did almost nothing to manage investor money, even when confronted with red flags of Quiros misuse.In an email interview, Mr. Stenger said he could not discuss the specific allegations against him. But in his most extensive comments yet on the situation, he said he knew he had let people down.Betrayal is a strong term, and I understand the disappointment because Im terribly disappointed not to be able to finish the work I started, he said. Still, he said, the projects have generated 6,500 direct and indirect jobs of the 10,000 he promised for rural Orleans County, the poorest in the state. He estimated that 650 of nearly 800 investors already have or would get their green cards.Im terribly upset that some of these folks could be at risk, he said, adding that he was seeking to make them financially whole.He said his biggest heartbreak was the failure to build the biotech firm, called AnC Bio, which the S.E.C. said was nearly a complete fraud.The community of Newport was fully supportive, and I feel Ive let them down, Mr. Stenger said.Mr. Leahy, a longtime Stenger backer, has been one of the biggest supporters of the EB-5 program, seeing it as an important tool for economic development. Indeed, it is working successfully in other projects in Vermont. But because of fraud in the program elsewhere, he was already pushing for an overhaul. Now, he says unless fundamental changes are made, EB-5 will die, and it should die.Mr. Shumlin deflected questions about whether state officials, by participating in the marketing campaign and not being skeptical sooner, bore some responsibility for the fraud. Until 2014, one state agency was responsible for both promoting the EB-5 program and regulating it. In addition, according to VTDigger, an online news organization, Mr. Shumlin accompanied the developers abroad to recruit investors and appeared in a promotional video for Mr. Stenger in which he said the projects were audited, though they were not; Mr. Shumlin has said that he misspoke regarding the audit and the video was taken down.There isnt a human being on this earth, when you go through a disappointment like this, that doesnt ask, Couldnt something have been done to find this sooner?  Mr. Shumlin said in an interview. We all wish the answer were yes, we all wish we got subpoena power to look at accounts earlier. But there was no reason to believe that what the developers were representing wasnt true.But others say the state was lax in pursuing hints of trouble, in part because officials trusted Mr. Stenger and had high hopes that the development could stimulate the economy.Michael Gibson, an EB-5 financial adviser based in Florida with USAdvisors.org, which specializes in risk analysis and due diligence on EB-5 investments, shared emails with The New York Times showing that he, for one, had raised questions with state officials as early as 2009.I didnt know there was a Ponzi scheme or fraud, Mr. Gibson said. But I had suspicions that they couldnt repay their initial investors and that they were taking investor money to pay for ongoing operations. And everyone told me to bug off.Many of the immigrant investors  about 400 of whom do not yet have permanent residency feel stranded, financially and because they could face deportation. One has already filed a class-action suit.Mohammed Adil, 49, an Indian who runs a fashion retail company and who wanted his four daughters to be educated in the United States, said he invested $550,000 in Jay Peak in 2012.I thought, if the government is giving out visas, there must be checks and balances on this program, he said. Now we have ended up in the soup, our money is probably gone and our green card is in trouble.Similarly, Felipe Vieira, 50, a financial analyst who moved his family to Vermont from Brazil in 2013, invested in townhouses at Jay Peak that are half finished. His chief concern is staying in the United States.Going back would feel like an enormous personal failure, he said.Even as they contemplate financial losses, some investors said they might put more money into the unfinished projects; creating at least 10 jobs is a condition of obtaining a green card.The investors dont want to liquidate; they want these jobs to continue so they can get their green cards, Mr. Shumlin said. Noting that Jay Peak plans to stay open and pay its employees, he added, In two years, this will look like a bump in the road to good jobs and great resorts."}
{"text": "What if Josh Charles had never left? What if Will Gardner, all hotheaded and masterful, were still around? Would the pressure for a happy ending have been too strong?Luckily, the producers of CBSs much-loved legal drama The Good Wife didnt have to worry about that, a little bonus of Mr. Charless surprise departure from the show two seasons ago. They got to bring Will back for the shows final episode on Sunday night as an imaginary friend advising Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) to get over her trepidations and run to her latest lover before it was too late. But Alicia chose duty over passion one last time, and the show ended its seven-season run the way it should have: with her alone, in pain but resilient, in control of nothing but her own decisions.The closing scene, with its Sopranos-style lack of resolution, will be fervidly debated. Its recapitulation of the seriess opening episode in 2009  Alicia once again standing by her husband, Peter, as he makes an embarrassing public mea culpa, and another resounding slap in the face, this time delivered to Alicia by her colleague and former friend Diane  was both gratifying and a little pat. Its execution shaded into melodrama, with Alicia chasing a man who turned out, predictably, not to be her lover.It was redeemed, as happened so often in the shows run, by Ms. Marguliess fierce intensity as Alicia. Devoting the final seconds to Ms. Margulies as Alicia reassembled herself after Dianes slap, began to regain her steel cloak of composure and walked out of the frame was foolproof.The mixed-bag ending was in keeping with the final season, which was smooth, enjoyable and at times quite moving. But it never sparkled or caught fire the way the series did in its best seasons, when it was broadcast televisions leading argument for continued relevance in the peak-TV era. The weekly legal cases  the show was resolutely procedural almost to the end  were still intelligently devised and briskly dispatched, but they felt familiar and not very urgent, and more than ever seemed to be lecturing viewers about current events.And when it came to the heart of the drama  the relationships among the lawyers, investigators, prosecutors, judges and assorted spouses and lovers in the hothouse atmosphere of Chicago law and politics  The Good Wife felt exhausted, pummeled by cast defections and bad decisions.The loss over the years of Mr. Charles and especially of Archie Panjabi as the lethally sexy investigator Kalinda Sharma diminished the show. But even more harmful were some of the storytelling choices made by the shows creators, Michelle and Robert King  the season-long criminal case against Matt Czuchrys Cary Agos, which marginalized a key character (and actor); the baffling on-again, off-again relationship between Alicia and Diane (the wonderful Christine Baranski), which seemed driven by the exigencies of plot rather than the imperatives of character. In the final season, the show sometimes felt diffuse and brittle on an emotional level, which may have made sense thematically  in terms of Alicias twinned movement toward independence and isolation  but didnt do much for the drama.As always, though, there were some rich compensations. One was the prominent role given to Makenzie Vega, whose portrayal of Alicias daughter, Grace, was one of the shows most reliable, if least noticed, strengths. The teenage Graces unassuming assumption of a major role in her mothers latest ad-hoc law firm, while not exactly realistic, provided a crucial element of warmth and humor. And Alicias relationship with the scruffy-sexy Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) might have lacked the swoony magic of Alicia-and-Will but it rang true, in interesting and, for broadcast TV, unusual ways, as a portrayal of the hazards of contemporary love and commitment.The greatest compensation, of course, was Ms. Margulies, who won two Emmy Awards for playing Alicia. She had some significant challenges. A minor one was the shows habit of making Alicia look clumsy and nave (to set up a segue into steely efficiency), which in the final season required Ms. Margulies to fumble stacks of file folders and struggle to open classified briefing papers.The big one was a character defined by self-control who mostly presented a blank, composed face to the world. Ms. Margulies made discipline vibrant and restraint provocative, and on the occasions when the story let her cut loose she wisely continued to underplay, showing us Alicias grief and ardor in brief, intense flashes before slamming on the brakes. She stayed true to the good wifes contradictions and demons to the very end, and its to the Kings credit that they let her and Alicia walk away without any easy answers."}
{"text": "The Obama administration is urging universities and colleges to re-evaluate how questions about an applicants criminal history are used in the admissions process, part of an effort to remove barriers to education, employment and housing for those with past convictions, in many cases for minor crimes.Education Secretary John B. King Jr. released a Dear Colleague letter to universities and colleges on Monday along with a guide, Beyond the Box: Increasing Access to Higher Education for Justice Involved Individuals. Among the guides recommendations is a suggestion that colleges consider delaying questions about criminal records until after admissions decisions to avoid a chilling effect on potential applicants.Noting that an estimated 70 million Americans have some form of criminal record, Mr. King said people who have been involved with the criminal justice system continue to face significant hurdles in obtaining access to higher education or career training.Most universities ask questions about an applicants criminal record as part of the admissions process. Requests for this information have increased in the past decade or so after several high-profile instances of campus violence.The Department of Educations announcement, in a telephone news conference with reporters on Monday, came amid growing concerns that admissions questions marginalize black applicants. A body of statistical evidence has emerged showing that black teenagers are singled out for disciplinary action in school, and stopped and arrested by the police at higher rates than other ethnic groups.In a separate announcement on Monday, representatives from the Common Application, used by more than 600 colleges, announced that the fall 2016 application would include a revised question about criminal history. Previously, the Common Application asked students whether they had been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or other crimes. The reference to other crimes, deemed ambiguous, will be omitted.The Common Application has also begun a review to determine whether additional revisions of its questions about criminal history and past school discipline questions should be made for the 2017 application, said Aba Blankson, its senior director.The State University of New York said Monday that its 64-campus system was already reviewing its practice of asking about criminal histories. A resolution by the SUNY student assembly, adopted in March, called for removal of such questions, citing research indicating that they discouraged prospective students from applying, and that there was no evidence that admitting those with criminal histories improves campus safety.Mr. King also said Monday that there was no evidence that such application questions deterred campus violence.Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system, said in the news conference with Mr. King that the universitys 10 campuses did not include such questions because they are not relevant to the evaluation of an individuals qualifications for study.The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an advocacy group, said this year that it was conducting an inquiry of colleges and universities that asked what it considered particularly intrusive questions on their applications, including questions about arrests without convictions.The Beyond the Box guide also recommends: Clearly informing potential students as early as possible in the application process about how to respond to questions about their criminal pasts. Ensuring that such questions are narrowly focused, avoiding overly broad requests about criminal history. Giving all prospective students an opportunity to explain criminal justice involvement and their preparedness for postsecondary study. Providing training for admissions officers and counselors on the effective use of criminal history data.The Education Departments initiative follows other Obama administration efforts aimed at reversing policies that limit the opportunities available to people with criminal records. The administration warned landlords this year that they cannot impose blanket bans on tenants with criminal convictions."}

{"text": "For months, Donald J. Trump denounced the Republican Party as a rigged system of party insiders trying to control the levers of power.But with the nomination fight behind him, Mr. Trumps campaign has moved to take advantage of the partys full array of assets, whether communications aides, a trove of data, a field operations staff or the ability to fund-raise jointly.That last piece is particularly important, as Mr. Trump turns to the task of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the general election, probably against a well-funded Hillary Clinton and the outside groups supporting her.In a three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Monday, Mr. Trumps advisers Paul J. Manafort, Rick Wiley, Corey Lewandowski and Michael Glassner met with the Republican National Committee finance chairman Lewis M. Eisenberg and the committee chairman, Reince Priebus.Mr. Priebus has made clear that there is no mechanism for Mr. Trump to insert his own handpicked chairman over the current structure. While that is technically true, Mr. Trump could certainly place a trusted ally on the committee to enforce his agenda.But even that is difficult for Mr. Trump, whose lean campaign is light on spare staff members, and who has to avail himself of the existing team at the party committee to be even remotely functional in a general-election fight.So while Mr. Trump has railed against the party as being unfair to him at various points, it is the Republican brand that got him a nomination. And he is forced to stick with it."}
{"text": "William A. Ackman, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, is paring back a stake in a health care stock. But it is not the one that has been generating lots of negative headlines.On Monday, Pershing set out to sell 16.85 million shares in Zoetis, the former animal health arm of Pfizer, for a price range of $46.75 to $47 per share, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.The transaction is expected to be valued around $800 million and will be managed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse. Pershing will continue to own 25 million shares in the company.The hedge fund paid $1.5 billion for an 8.5 percent stake in Zoetis in November 2014, according a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock has since gained 8.6 percent. Last year, Zoetis added William F. Doyle, a representative for Pershing Square, to its board of directors. On April 22, Pershing Square said Mr. Doyle, would step down from the board of Zoetis this week.It has been a difficult year for Mr. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Holdings fund is down 18 percent, dragged down in large part by a 9 percent position in Valeant, the pharmaceutical company that has come under intense political and regulatory scrutiny. The fund has concentrated positions in a dozen companies, making the portfolio vulnerable to sharp declines in just one or two holdings. Mr. Ackman may be selling the shares to raise cash in response to investor redemption requests or in order to make a new investment.Pershing Square trimmed its stake in another holding in March, selling 20 million shares in Mondelez International, the food and beverage company. At the time of the sale, Mondelez shares were down 7 percent for the year.Representatives from Pershing Square and Credit Suisse declined to comment. A representative from Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment."}
{"text": "PALMYRA, Syria  For a Russian, there is never a bad time or place for a classical music concert.And for the concert in the ancient ruins of this war-ravaged Syrian city, staged last week by Russias premier orchestra, the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra, the invitation came as improbably as the event itself.Russias Foreign Ministry called my cellphone on a Saturday morning: Be ready to fly to Syria in a few days. We cannot tell you anything more. But there is a dress code. Bring a bulletproof vest.So began the latest twist to Russias military intervention in the Syrian civil war, which has been characterized by subterfuge and misdirection since it started in September. Thats when the world was told that giant Ilyushin 76 transport airplanes flying from Russia to Syria were carrying humanitarian aid, when in fact they were bringing soldiers and military supplies.Airstrikes commenced. The Russians said their warplanes were targeting terrorists; Western governments, however, said the real objective was to prop up Moscows ally, the government of President Bashar al-Assad.In March, Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin, proclaimed the operation completed, yet at least hundreds of soldiers and dozens of aircraft remained.The curtain pulled back, if just a little, on Russias Syrian venture when the Russian press plane touched down around dawn one day last week at the Kremlins air base in the coastal city of Latakia.Nearly a hundred Moscow-based foreign reporters emerged, blinking in the sun, and were greeted by Russias desert soldiers. Round, sunburned Slavic faces peered from under tan helmets.The tour of Russias battle for hearts and minds  and ears  in Syria began in a tent mess, where a line of cheery middle-aged women ladled out kasha and tushonka, the Russian form of Spam.One group of soldiers, dressed in blue shorts and T-shirts, played volleyball and jabbed away at punching bags for the television cameras.An enlisted man was placed in a shipping container turned library, his nose trained on an open encyclopedia of Russian military medals, as if, improbably, he had suddenly decided to study up, as cameras rolled.Defense is a system of political, economic, social, legal and military means, a placard on the wall read, seeming to illustrate the modern Russian way of war that we were witnessing.Sometimes called a hybrid war after the intervention in Ukraine in 2014 that brought these tactics to light, it is a doctrine of tightly integrated diplomacy and messaging  including the art of military misdirection called maskirovka  along with conventional force, at play now in Syria.This strategy prizes so-called soft power. In Syria, however, old-fashioned hard power also abounds.The air base is a panoramic scene, cluttered with helicopters and planes. Russian armored vehicles and trucks sit on acres of parking lots. Despite the declared end of their presence here, there was no sign of packing up. During our visit, a Syrian road crew was laying fresh, smoking black asphalt to make room for more.But Russia, as the United States tried in Iraq, has also been attempting to navigate the whirlpools of the wars local politics.Reporters were paraded through a reconciliation center, where a dozen or so Russian officers take calls from armed units seeking to join the cease-fire announced in February, and aid them in negotiating local truces with the Syrian Army. A flat-screen television hung on the wall beaming a static image of a dove, an olive sprig and the Syrian flag.To illustrate its peacemaking efforts, the Russian military brought the press pool by bus to the dusty village of Kawkab, in Hama Province, about 70 miles from the embattled city of Aleppo and near a front line.The site of ruined cinder-block homes, on a hill overlooking olive orchards, appeared deserted at first, but then a crowd of children, chanting and waving posters of Mr. Assad, emerged to greet the buses.It took many months for the warring sides to come to the negotiating table but it has finally come to fruition, the Russian military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said of this place.In a large green tent pitched in a ruined market, Syrian military officers signed a cease-fire agreement with village leaders. Then, through a slit in the back of the tent, young men with red-and-white head scarves covering their faces materialized, said to be newly reconciled Islamic militants from the village.With the Russian military officers observing from their seats on white plastic lawn furniture, the young men clanked battered Kalashnikovs onto a table, surrendering their weapons, then pressed a thumbprint on a sheet of paper.The Russian military says that it has overseen more than 90 such ceremonies in towns and villages since February, reconciling more than 7,000 former rebels, and that this work, not merely the airstrikes backing Mr. Assads forces, is central to its presence.It was unclear, however, who had reconciled with whom in this ceremony.Asked through a Russian military interpreter when he had come over to the government side, one of the village leaders who signed the agreement, Akhmed Mubarok, appeared confused. He said he had never been on any other side.I always supported the government, he said. The interpreter shrugged.Outside the tent, a Russian press official suggested I interview a local man, Mohamad Shoikh, who, surprisingly, spoke English.Russia has a very good army, Mr. Shoikh said. We need the Russian Army. We never want the Russian Army to leave. We want the whole Russian Army to come here. Putin is a good leader.All the while, there was not a word of confirmation about the concert in Palmyra, the city famous for its ruins from Roman and Near East civilizations that had been in the bloody grip of the Islamic State until earlier this year.This was a military operation, cloaked in secrecy, to insert not only the journalists but three stand-up basses, cellos and other instruments and musicians from St. Petersburg into the Syrian front-line city.After a dawn departure from the Mediterranean coast, Russian helicopter gunships buzzed overhead as separate convoys of buses, with the press and the string section, drove east into the Syrian desert.Afterward, Britains foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, criticized the concert as a tasteless attempt to distract attention from suffering Syrians, and he noted that an airstrike on a refugee camp that day had killed 28 people. Russia denied its planes had bombed the camp.But the concert was simply, starkly beautiful, and unfolded as the late afternoon sun faded over the ruins.Valery Gergiev, the Mariinsky director, said he chose the pieces for their optimistic emotions, to be played on the same stage where Islamic State militants last summer had filmed a video of a mass execution. We protest against barbarism that destroyed tremendous monuments to world culture, Mr. Gergiev said. We protest against executions of people, here on this stage.Played in a second-century Roman amphitheater, it was a concert of a lifetime  and surely risked a few lives along the way. The Islamic State lines were said to be about nine miles away; outgoing artillery boomed as the buses arrived.Then the gentler sounds of Pavel Milyukov playing Johann Sebastian Bachs Chaconne for Solo Violin echoed through the eerie desert space.Sergei P. Roldugin, a musician friend of Mr. Putin recently implicated in the Panama Papers financial scandal, acknowledged after the concert that he had missed notes in a cello solo of the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin, though the piece was pleasant all the same. The orchestra played Sergei Prokofievs Symphony No. 1.After the solemn harmony, some comic dissonance was obtained on the return flight, over Iraqi and Iranian airspace.Some Russian journalists, it turned out, had slipped out of the security bubble in Latakia to purchase several bottles of a local tipple, Arak, which the Russian press corps nicknamed Igilovka or the Little ISIS.Bottles of the Little ISIS came out. A wicked miasma floated around the cabin. Americans and Russians agreed on one thing: Igilovka must be destroyed. And it was, before the final approach to the Chkalovsky military airfield outside Moscow."}
{"text": "On Monday, as the spring auction season began in New York, Sothebys announced a $25.9 million loss for the first quarter of 2016, compared to income of $5.2 million the year before. The publicly held auction house said that the loss was unremarkable, having posted a first quarter loss for 22 out of the last 25 years.Still, Sothebys could have used some good news at a time when the art world is watching to see whether the tumultuous changes wrought by the companys president and chief executive, Tad Smith, are paying off.Mr. Smith has invited this kind of scrutiny by spending up to $85 million for a boutique art advisory business in January even as he reduced staff by 80 people through buyouts, incurring an expense of $40 million.The reorganization included bringing in Amy Cappellazzo, a former Christies executive and co-founder of the acquired Art Agency, Partners, to lead a new fine art division, above several of Sothebys longtime specialists. This helped contribute to the departures of more than a dozen executives, resulting in a significant brain drain for the auction house, several art experts said.Mr. Smith also oversaw the largest guarantee in auction history paid for a single collection, to the family of A. Alfred Taubman last fall. Sothebys guarantee to the family was $509 million and sales thus far have brought $473 million, including post auction private sales. But the company says its shortfall on the sale is only $3 million because of the potential value of the unsold Taubman lots it still owns.The days of the two major auction houses making big losing bets on guarantees just to gain market share may be behind us, but many other challenges face both houses in a choppy market, said Thomas C. Danziger, a New York lawyer who negotiates auction sales for major dealers, advisers and collectors. The next two weeks may well be a watershed moment for Sothebys.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, Mr. Smith said that Sothebys nevertheless experienced a number of high points so far in the second quarter, including a 17 percent sales increase in its April Hong Kong sales, adding that he was hopeful about the coming week of auctions.Mr. Smith also said on the call that an undisclosed outside Sothebys investor might make further purchases of the companys stock  through the open market, private transactions, block trades or derivative transactions  to bring that persons holdings to at least 10 percent of the outstanding shares. The auction houses stock jumped on this news, rising six percent to close at $28.91 a share.While it is unusual for Sothebys to float the prospect of a stock purchase without providing more specifics, some analysts said they were encouraged by the forthcoming nature of the announcement.There is a naturally high level of opacity to Sothebys talking about their business, said said David Schick, the lead luxury analyst at Consumer Edge Research. So a wide-ranging talk about the art cycle, details on expenses, changes in strategy and an outside buyer all worked to break down that lack of understanding.More clarity improved investor confidence, Mr. Schick continued, and, we think, helped contribute to a rally for the shares.The loss, Sothebys said, was partly because of a 35 percent decrease for the company in its auction sales over all, the primary factor in a 33 percent decrease in commissions. The auction houses total revenues were down $49.1 million compared to last year.Some analysts agreed that a general market trend was largely responsible. This is a big reflection of where the art cycle is and what that does to the financials, Mr. Schick said.The impact of Mr. Smiths changes, Mr. Schick said, have yet to be seen. When you bring in a new manager, it actually gets worse before it gets better, he said. The company is repositioning under new leadership.Since the second and fourth quarters include the biannual marquee New York Impressionist, Modern and contemporary sales, they have in recent years represented about 80 percent of total annual auction revenue. Sothebys said that investors should focus on results for those periods, which better reflect the business cycle of the art auction market.David Kusin, who runs the consulting firm Kusin & Company, said it was way too soon to draw any conclusions about Sothebys performance. The froth has gone out of the uplift, he said. Prices should be down compared with the past few years.An anticipated softening in the market has made inventory more limited at all auction houses, and guarantees more circumspect. We might be in that situation for quite a while, Mr. Smith told analysts on Monday, adding that he was going to be very careful and conservative on guarantees. However, Sothebys evening contemporary sale this Wednesday features 10 works whose sellers have been guaranteed minimum prices, amounting to a total of at least $70 million.Among those who have left or are leaving Sothebys are David Norman, vice chairman of Sothebys Americas and chairman of worldwide Impressionist and Modern art, who has been at the company for 31 years; Melanie Clore, Sothebys co-chairwoman of Impressionist and Modern art and chairwoman of its business in Europe (35 years); Cheyenne Westphal, Sothebys head of contemporary art worldwide (25 years); and Alex Rotter, the co-head of contemporary art worldwide.Well know in six months if these moves were an upgrade, said George Sutton, an analyst at Craig-Hallum. Youd have to think that would affect things in the short term, so we werent surprised to see the spring auctions very thin.Many in the art world have also questioned the long-term viability of bringing in Art Agency, Partners  which, in addition to Ms. Cappellazzo, the former chairwoman of Christies postwar and contemporary-art development, includes Allan Schwartzman, a longtime art adviser, and Adam Chinn, a former investment banker.Dont these three create a conflict of interest, the art world has asked, given that it would seem difficult for an in-house Sothebys advisory firm to counsel clients impartially? And can Sothebys longtime specialists feel comfortable reporting to Ms. Cappellazzo, who may not have as much expertise in their practice areas?On Monday, Mr. Smith suggested that his acquisition of the advisory group was partly an effort to improve Sothebys private sales. We have a terrific team, he said, but on some of the other pieces of that value chain, weve got a little work to do."}
{"text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.  Appealing to working parents buckling under financial pressure, Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that families should not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income on child care.If were going to say we are for family values, then we need to value families, Mrs. Clinton said in a speech at a health center while campaigning in Kentucky, whose Democratic primary is next Tuesday.In Kentucky, Mrs. Clinton said, a family with both parents earning minimum wage has to spend about 20 percent of its income on child care, while a single parent earning the minimum wage has to spend 40 percent of his or her income.Mrs. Clinton did not spell out how she would ensure that families costs would not exceed 10 percent, although her campaign said her plan to limit costs would include subsidies and tax relief.A report released in October by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, examined how much of a familys earnings are consumed by child care costs in 10 metropolitan areas around the country. In those areas, child care costs for an infant and a 4-year-old accounted for roughly 20 to 30 percent of the median family income, the report said.In her speech, Mrs. Clinton outlined a variety of goals to help reduce the stresses on working parents, including encouraging employers to improve unpredictable, absolutely backbreaking schedules for workers and expanding home visiting programs, in which nurses and social workers visit new and expectant parents. She also said she would work to increase the pay of child care workers.At the same time, Mrs. Clinton took aim at the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, bringing up his stance earlier in the campaign about wages  he said they were too high, although he has recently said otherwiseI think with somebody like Donald Trump, you would see a race to the bottom across our country, with working families paying the price, Mrs. Clinton said. And I dont think thats a risk we can afford.In recent days, Mrs. Clintons team has been relentless in branding Mr. Trump as dangerous and divisive, while Mrs. Clinton has focused mostly on issues.Earlier on Tuesday, she also held a discussion with a small group of parents in Lexington. She spoke of her own time as a mother and grandmother, recalling a lesson she learned after the birth of her granddaughter, Charlotte.I never swaddled Chelsea, she said. And now its like, Oh, youve got to swaddle the baby. So, learning how you swaddle a baby  you know, thats an art form.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "FORT McMURRAY, Alberta  Aside from the complete lack of children, everything at first looks fine outside cole Boral, a French language school in Fort McMurrays Abasand neighborhood. But a closer inspection showed signs of danger, and a hasty retreat from it: a fallen lamppost, a cooler bag abandoned in a student drop-off zone.Immediately across the street the devastation that the great fire brought to this city is grimly apparent. Behind a charred chain-link fence, the blackened frames of two childrens bicycles nestled beside the remains of an adults mountain bike. Of the townhouse where their owners once lived, little remained but a battered air-conditioning unit.Contrasts abounded during a brief tour of the city, where 88,000 people fled as flames and smoke advanced on May 3. The power of the forest fire, which continued to grow on Monday as it swept through the hub of Albertas oil sands region, is unmistakable.Much of the city remains intact, an eerie ghost town of abandoned cars and darkened storefronts. Following a tour of the area, Rachel Notley, Albertas premier, said that 2,400 buildings had been destroyed but about 25,000 remained standing.The path the flames took was obvious. Southwest of the city, a burned-out bus sat at the Flying J service station, which exploded as residents drove down Highway 63, the only escape route to the south. About two blocks north, the attractive stone and wood sign at the entrance to the Beacon Hill neighborhood remained unmolested by flame, as did a Shell gas station across from it. But just past that, at the top of a rise, a panorama of destruction unfolded.Beacon Hill was one of Fort McMurrays oldest and most popular areas. Built during an oil sands boom in the 1970s, its houses and yards were larger than those in the developments that followed, after real estate prices shot up.Beacon Hill was the first residential area destroyed by the expanding fire. Without exception, its once-prized homes have all been reduced to basements filled with charred rubble. The highest remaining points on many lots are the twisted metal pipes that once supported electricity meters.On the blackened front lawn of one house, garden hose lay melted.Darby Allen, the fire chief, said that a lack of personnel and poor water pressure forced his crews to quickly abandon Beacon Hill and focus on saving the downtown and other parts of the city. Despite that, the neighborhoods strip mall, its liquor store still firmly shuttered, and two schools suffered little or no damage  thanks to a change in the winds direction. Cars parked on Beacon Hills streets appeared largely unscathed, although the plastic grill of one pickup truck had sagged from the heat. Pools of molten aluminum trickled down driveways from cars that had been left next to homes.At the bottom of the black swath left by the fire as it departed Beacon Hill, a trailer park was incinerated except for about six homes. The area had recently been rebuilt after a flood.An adjacent fire station still stood, thanks mainly to its array of sprinklers. Even now, fires still flare up in the city. Several smoldering blazes could be seen along the highway. Yet on Monday the situation had eased to the point that some firefighters were outside a fire station washing black soot off two of their trucks.The black line of destruction abruptly veered west just before reaching Fort McMurrays hospital and downtown. Firefighters had focused their defenses there, Chief Allen said. The fire instead headed toward Abasand, passing near a sign for a Mothers Day craft fair, complete with face painting, which was never held.With each minute the fire had become more potent, expanding its reach by heaving flames before it. The results were cruelly random. In a section of Abasand built as housing for employees of Syncrude, the oil sands mega project of the 1970s, blocks of total ruin faced untouched houses just across the street.As one townhouse burned and collapsed, its kitchen stove ended up in the entrance of an underground parking lot. The half-dozen cars inside the lot fared no better than the stove.In one yard, an all-terrain vehicle, popular in Fort McMurray, was shorn of all its plastic and rubber.In another area, the gas pumps and convenience store of an Esso service station remained intact. But its sign and touchless carwash were melted, charred ruins.The destruction, while not as severe as many had feared, appeared to have overwhelmingly struck homes. Whether by luck or design, civic and industrial buildings fared better. At an industrial park near the airport, the fires charred line stopped in front of a yard filled with rental construction equipment.Something similar seemed to have happened at the Oil Sands Discovery Center, a museum for the tourists who make the long drive to Fort McMurray. The fire went right to an excavator from the early days of the oil sands development, but left the dinosaur-sized machine untouched. The museum building, surrounded by a large parking lot, seemed to have escaped serious damage.In addition to the homes lost, much work remains before Fort McMurray can start to rebuild. Sections of the city, even within the spared downtown, appeared to be without power. Aside from emergency workers, the largest presence in the city were utilities crews, on hand to assess damage and replace burned-out poles, wires and cables.Chief Allen said his downtown apartment survived the beast of a fire. For those who were not so fortunate, he asked that they understand that firefighters gave it their all.He added: It was like a fire Id never seen in my life."}
{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore.  The big reveal for the Golden State Warriors came in parts.First, there was the sight of Stephen Curry, absent for the first three games of his teams Western Conference semifinal series with the Portland Trail Blazers, striding onto the court at Moda Center on Monday night so he could dribble two basketballs at once, a staple of his pregame routine.Then, minutes later, Coach Steve Kerr confirmed what everyone already suspected  that Curry would play.What happened next defied reasonable expectations, even for a basketball maestro like Curry, who has assembled a myth-making season. Fifteen days after spraining his right knee in a first-round game against the Houston Rockets, Curry brushed off the dust to carry the Warriors to a 132-125 overtime victory that gave them a 3-1 series lead.Crazy, Kerr said.Remarkable, Trail Blazers Coach Terry Stotts said.My confidence never wavered, said Curry, who set another N.B.A. record in a season full of them by scoring 17 points in overtime.Curry finished with 40 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists. He shot 6 of 7 from the field in overtime, connecting on all three of his 3-point attempts.You miss three weeks, its really weird walking back on the court, said Curry, who had missed two games with a right ankle sprain before spraining his knee. It took 48 minutes, and things finally clicked.If Curry lacked his usual rhythm through three quarters  he missed his first nine 3-point attempts  he was adept at making layups, and he scored the Warriors first 12 points of overtime. His fourth 3-pointer of the game gave Golden State a 5-point lead, and a night full of drama here gave way to desperation, then sadness.The Warriors can close out the series Wednesday night at Oracle Arena.They survived no shortage of adversity in Game 4. They trailed by 16 points in the first quarter. Draymond Green played through foul trouble. Shaun Livingston was ejected late in the first half for arguing a call, leaving Kerr with a short bench when he had hoped to monitor Currys playing time.Instead, Curry wound up supplying 36 minutes and clogged the box score by shooting 16 of 32 from the field. Klay Thompson added 23 points in the win.A lot of it was just the timing issue, Curry said. You shoot shots in practice, and you try to simulate game speed and whatnot, but most of the time nobodys guarding you. So its a little different. And then a lot of it is allowing that muscle memory to come back.Damian Lillard had 36 points and 10 assists for the Trail Blazers, and C. J. McCollum added 24 points.The Warriors surged at the start of the third quarter. Curry darted through the lane for a layup to cut the deficit to 3. He also acted as a facilitator, finding Thompson for a 3-pointer that put the Warriors ahead by 1. Early in the fourth quarter, Curry buried a two-foot jumper and the Warriors were up by 5.But the teams continued to exchange 3-pointers  and the lead  as they fought to the finish of regulation. Lillard, despite struggling with his shot for so much of the game, emerged with a series of jumpers. But the Warriors Harrison Barnes sank a 3-pointer to tie the score, 111-111, and the game went to overtime.Coming off the bench was an unfamiliar role for Curry. He had not done it in more than four years. Without him for the first six minutes, the Warriors labored  much as they had in Game 3. Lillard made two 3-pointers as the Blazers ran out to a 16-2 lead. The Warriors, meanwhile, missed 11 of their first 12 shots.Curry soon stripped off his warm-ups as he made the slow walk to the scorers table, his first appearance of the series accompanied by enthusiastic boos.The Blazers were determined to make Curry work by running him through an obstacle course of screens. At the other end, he sank a 15-foot jumper that narrowed the Blazers lead to 12.Yet the Warriors could not escape adversity. After Livingstons ejection, the Trail Blazers went into halftime with a 67-57 lead.For the first two games of the series, the Warriors compensated for Currys absence. Livingston capably filled in as the teams starting point guard. Thompson sank shots. Green created havoc. The Warriors won both games, motoring along even as Curry watched from the bench in street clothes.But the Warriors, lacking ball movement and what Kerr described as desperation, finally stumbled Saturday in Game 3. Lillard collected 40 points and 10 assists to lead the Trail Blazers to a lopsided victory, which enlivened Portlands confidence and ramped up the drama ahead of Game 4.Perhaps the Warriors would have felt less urgency to activate Curry with a 3-0 series lead. But Curry did not need to lobby to play, Kerr said. It was a collective decision made after Kerr had conversations with General Manager Bob Myers, members of the teams medical staff and Curry himself, who assured everyone that he was fine.As he went through his pregame routine, Curry appeared to be moving well, sinking shots much to the delight of hundreds of early-arriving fans who snapped photographs with their mobile devices. After he physically moved a security guard out of the way for his final shot  a fading 3-pointer from deep in the corner  Curry raised an arm as he ran off the court.Three hours later, he left the court again, this time with victory in hand."}
{"text": "Affluent communities often assume that their well-appointed schools are excellent and that educational malpractice affects only the children of the poor. Former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who stepped down in December, was widely criticized when he debunked this myth three years ago and went on to suggest that well-to-do parents who rebelled against the rigorous Common Core learning standards were part of the problem.The idea that schools in privileged communities are failing to prepare significant numbers of students is borne out in a striking new study showing that nearly half of the students who begin their college careers taking remedial courses come from middle- and upper-income families. Not only do remedial courses add more than $1 billion each year to students bills for tuition, but students who start out in these classes take longer to graduate and are far more likely to drop out.The study, by Education Reform Now, a nonprofit think tank, analyzes cost and course data collected by the Education Department for students who entered college in 2011. More than a half-million poorly prepared students  or about one in four  were required to take remedial courses in math, English or writing. Forty-five percent of them came from middle-, upper-middle- and high-income families.Fifty-seven percent of the students needing remedial classes attended public community colleges. The rest went to other schools, including private four-year nonprofit colleges and universities.The costs to families are considerable. For example, remedial students at private, nonprofit four-year schools spent an average of $12,000 extra to study content that should have been learned in high school. The total cost for all students and their families for remediation was nearly $1.5 billion for the 2011-12 school year.The cost can be measured not just in dollars, but also in unmet goals. Among full-time students seeking a bachelors degree, those who take remedial courses are 74 percent more likely to drop out of college than nonremedial students.The study challenges commonly held preconceptions about who needs extra help in college. At private, nonprofit four-year schools, for example, students whose families were in the top 20 percent of income nationally actually took more remedial courses than students in the bottom 20 percent at the same colleges.The study does not indicate the specific places where these higher-income students grew up. But the income data suggest that many come from suburban communities whose schools did not prepare them for college-level work. Part of the problem is that high schools offer a rigorous curriculum for relatively few students and often use a grading system that masks underperformance.Wealthier districts have been strongholds of the movement against standardized testing and the Common Core learning standards, which have been adopted by more than 40 states and set ambitious goals for what students should learn as they move through school.As the study notes, many elected officials, parents and teachers have become complacent about the quality of their schools. This complacency is making it harder for the country to build the kind of education system it needs  one that provides high-level instruction for all children."}
{"text": "Ruth Rogers, the vivacious restaurateur who traded Woodstock for London almost 50 years ago, is stationed in the shiny, open-plan kitchen of her Georgian terrace home. Sunshine streams into the double-height living space, where no fewer than eight sash windows look out onto a palatial Chelsea Square. Today, the celebrated chef and proprietor of what is surely the citys most cherished Italian dining room, the River Caf, is wearing a knitted dress in shocking pink (the favorite hue of her husband, the architect Richard Rogers). On the far wall, a smudgy Cy Twombly canvas hangs above a row of ceramics. The unglazed vessels look very Edmund de Waal, but in fact are the creation of Rogerss mother-in-law, Dada, who first taught her to cook. Edmund de Waal admired them when he came to dinner, says Rogers of the ceramicists handiwork, as she scales a ladder to reach a vertiginous kitchen cupboard. The whisk she procures proves essential in the days delicious agenda: the preparation of white and green asparagus served with a sparkly take on a traditional Bagna Cauda (meaning hot bath) sauce. Here, the red wine that typically makes up this centuries-old northern Italian recipe, featuring garlic and anchovies, is swapped for Prosecco (the full recipe for which is detailed below).Were very seasonal at The River Caf, Rogers says of the springtime dish, which kicks off the four-course banquet she will prepare at next weeks Edible Schoolyard NYCs spring benefit, alongside chefs like Daniel Boulud and Michael Anthony. The dinner, chaired by David Chang, will support the heartwarming nonprofit program that teaches children the joy of growing, cooking and sharing food through hands-on experience. We chose this for the Edible Schoolyard Benefit because its light and clean. Its important to respect a vegetable well enough not to destroy the flavor with a sauce, Rogers says, as she pours Prosecco freely into the pan. The asparagus should be allowed to be the star of the dish.For cooks, first-of-the-season asparagus heralds the arrival of spring in the kitchen. But the beneficiaries of Edible Schoolyard NYC view the vegetable in rather more sinister terms: They call them zombie fingers because thats what they look like when they break through the earth, explains ESNYCs executive director Kate Brashares of the children, who are fascinated by the seed-to-table alchemy of the programs vegetable gardens  and also, worms. Certainly Rogerss unfussy and seasonal style, which has its roots in domestic Italian cooking, chimes with the Edible ethos: Dont expect to order a tomato salad year-round at the River Caf, where the Michelin-starred menu is about fresh ingredients, simply yet seamlessly prepared. We see whats in the fridge, and whats been ordered that day, then sit down and write the menu, says Rogers of her close-knit team. Thats what keeps us excited. I grew up in America where its all about choice  but whats the point of having 20 types of tomato in winter if they all taste of nothing?When Rogers first opened the River Caf, together with the late Rose Gray in 1987, it served as the staff canteen for her husbands (since relocated) architectural practice. At the time you could either eat well somewhere terrifying where the sommelier made you feel stupid, or go to a local place and have a great time but eat badly, she says. We wanted to create a fun, lively and approachable place that reflected the way we lived. The River Cafs informality, which spills over into the democratic kitchen where the waiters arrive early to help prep the food, invigorated the London culinary scene, even introducing new ingredients such as cavolo nero to the British market. Next year this beloved institution, where lunch frequently lingers into late afternoon on the Thames-side terrace, celebrates its 30th anniversary. Though Rogers still keenly feels the loss of her longtime friend and collaborator Rose Gray, she has no intention of stopping anytime soon and is currently searching for a second site after one earmarked in Mayfair met with resistance from locals (who cant have ever sampled her cooking): The greatest tribute to Rose is for The River Caf to be thriving, she says, turning her attention back to the plated asparagus, before brightly volunteering a typically uncomplicated taste test: If theres no resistance when you put the fork in, theyre done.Yield: 4-6 servings1 bottle good quality Prosecco8 cloves garlic, cut in half lengthways2 bunches green asparagus2 bunches white asparagus12 salted anchovy fillets (preferably Ortiz)14 tablespoons unsalted Italian butter, cubed, room temperatureCrushed black pepperExtra-virgin olive oilSalt1. Pour the whole bottle of Prosecco into a saucepan with all of the garlic cloves. Reduce on a moderate-high heat until the liquid has reduced and the garlic is soft. It should reduce to roughly just under a glass.2. While the Prosecco is reducing, prepare the asparagus by snapping the stalks at their natural breaking point, discarding the lower part. Peel the stalks of the white asparagus. (You dont need to peel the green asparagus.)3. When the Prosecco has reduced, remove from the heat and stir in the anchovy fillets. They will dissolve with the heat of the liquid. You can use a potato masher to help break up the anchovies.4. Using a whisk, add the butter little by little, whisking vigorously to make an emulsified sauce. Remove from the heat and finish the sauce with a pinch of black pepper and a dash of the olive oil.5. Plunge the white asparagus into rapidly boiling, salted water first. Allow them to cook for 4-5 minutes before placing the green asparagus into the same water, and cook for another 4 minutes.6. Use a knife to test the asparagus stalks  there shouldnt be any resistance. Once they are tender, drain them well and dry on kitchen towel. Season with salt, pepper and olive oil. Arrange them on a plate and pour the sauce over liberally."}
{"text": "Forget throwing stones: A more pressing concern, for those who live in glass houses, is that its impossible to hide in them. Or is it? The Glass House, the architect Philip Johnsons sprawling 49-acre New Canaan, Conn., estate and titular Modernist building comprising 1,800 square feet of four-walled, floor-to-ceiling clear glass, famously plays with the boundary between voyeurism and hiding in plain sight  a function tangled up in Johnsons homosexuality.The closet is a very complex mechanism. Now we believe that everyone should be out. But its a dialectic  in a way, it protected something, says Brennan Gerard, one-half of the performance and art duo Gerard & Kelly. The second installment of their performance piece Modern Living, co-produced by Art Production Fund, arrives at the Glass House this Friday and Saturday. We were thinking about how the house sheltered and protected a queer subculture  mostly gay men and mostly artists, who werent totally out, Gerard explains.Ryan Kelly chimes in: Johnson talks a lot about the wish to be caught  thats definitely been inspiring, the way the box is an invitation of voyeurism. The Glass House, a leisurely residence for Johnson and his partner David Whitney, became a retreat of gay society soirees, and its still astonishing how the compounds neighbors remained oblivious to the libertine carousing next door. But that may have been Glasss intention all along, as Gerard explains: The more time I spent in that space, I realized that the glass served to reflect, from the outside. As much as its transparent, there are moments in the day where its literally opaque. And this piece, in many ways, is a way of moving forward by looking back.The costumes, too, engage with the complexities of Johnsons life and work. The duo enlisted Uri Minkoff to create nine dark, uniform-like suits in a fun, fetishistic way, but also a fascistic way, Kelly says, evoking Johnsons turn to the extreme right  including time spent in Germany during the Third Reich, a detail often glossed over in his popular lore. It was not without risk for us or the curators for a project to deal with queer and politically problematic issues of Johnson, Kelly says.This weekends performance piece is the second in a series that debuted in January at Los Angeless Schindler House  a 1921 construction that, like the Glass House, subverts the traditional domestic expectations of home. (The Schindler House was built to accommodate two families who shared common space.) At the core of Modern Living, Gerard says, is looking to Modernist sites and reframing them as queer sites, and asking what they might be in terms of ruins. The function of so much domestic architecture is towards biological reproduction. Kelly elaborates: This is why we made the project  how do you live queerly? Meaning not giving into convention. In preparation for the project, the duo lived in the Marcel Breuer House at Pocantico Hills as part of a residency that allowed them to delve further into their inquiry of queer domesticity. Ryan and I lived there for two weeks  you can really feel the specter of the nuclear family, the space is highly gendered, Gerard says. (We were traumatized, Kelly says of the house plan.)Intimacy and the transmission of cultural history are at the forefront of Gerard & Kellys practice, which exists mostly in performance but extends into dance, video and text. This time around, with nine professional dancers  a first for the duo  borrowed from Benjamin Millepieds L.A. Dance Project, the piece distills this idea of relationships into ideas of rhythm, and then how rhythms interact with others, falling in and out of space, Gerard says. Theres a looping quality to the work that Kelly compares to a GIF: We were interested in the pleasure of synchronization, and asynchronization, he says. Theres a lot of layering, as a spectator you have to make choices about what you want to see, though you always have a sense or are aware of whats going behind you."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Unfailingly punctual, he enters the office without a word. He shakes hands with staff members who rise hastily from their desks, and studies the home state curios on the walls. He is ushered in behind closed doors, and within the hour he leaves as quietly as he came, occasionally slipping out a back exit with his retinue.Then comes the statement, from one Republican senator after another: I had a pleasant visit with Judge Merrick B. Garland. He is an intelligent, talented jurist. However, I cannot support considering his nomination to the Supreme Court.With this tango of praise and rejection, the once sacrosanct process of filling a Supreme Court seat has taken a surreal turn. In the past, even eyebrow-raising nominees received a hearing and a vote. But Senate Republican leaders have said for nearly two months that Judge Garland, a relatively uncontroversial nominee, will get neither.White House officials have not blinked in this staring contest. They have scheduled meetings with any senator who will return their messages  46 to date, including 14 Republicans. This to-and-fro has left Judge Garland, broadly regarded as a leading legal mind, looking a little like the earnest leaflet-clutching visitors who hope to raise awareness for their cause and grab a sandwich in the Senate cafeteria.The situation seems poised to grow only more complicated, with Donald J. Trump wearing the fire-engine-red baseball cap of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.While Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has been implacable in his opposition to considering the nomination, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said his party should be pragmatic. If the Republicans lose the presidential election, he said, that might mean confirming Judge Garland in the lame-duck session before the Democratic victor could make a new  and potentially more liberal  nomination.If we come to September and we have a certain candidate, that it doesnt look promising, then we may want to reconsider, Mr. Flake said with a coy smile.Democrats, meanwhile, are maintaining their optimism as the Senate returns this week from a recess, citing polls saying that most Americans think the Senate should consider Judge Garlands nomination. They point to each incremental concession  a word of admiration here, a courtesy meeting there  as proof of Republicans weakening resolve.During the recess last week, the Democrats followed home some of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents, with Mr. Obama giving regional television interviews and the group Americans United for Change driving around billboards to urge action on the nomination.And on Monday, the White House said that Judge Garland would submit a detailed questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday detailing his experience and credentials. Usually a routine step, the move this time is another tactic to pressure senators to act.The nomination impasse has become a serious campaign issue, said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.All you have to do is look at the Republicans numbers, which are dropping significantly, he told reporters on Thursday. And I think theres going to come a time in the near future when even theyre going to say: Oh, Mitch, Ive had enough of this. Lets go ahead with this hearing and have a vote and get this over with.Mr. McConnell, however, has emphasized that nearly every Republican senator agrees that the next president should get to nominate a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. (Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois have been the lone holdouts, calling for Judge Garland to get full consideration.)It is rare for the Senate to reject a Supreme Court nominee  the last time it did so was in 1987, when it voted against Robert H. Bork after an ugly political battle. In 2005, Harriet E. Miers, President George W. Bushs White House counsel, withdrew amid questions about her fitness for the court and her stance on issues like abortion.But even Ms. Miers, the 10th and most recent nominee to fail without a confirmation hearing, was expected to receive a hearing, albeit a potentially rough one, given the lackluster reviews of her meetings with senators.No president in at least the past century has had a Supreme Court nominee go unconfirmed on the grounds that it was an election year, according to Scotusblog, which covers the court.Calling on senator after senator in their offices, Judge Garland has filled the minutes with smiles and small talk.Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, said he had met with Judge Garland because presidential nominees deserve such a courtesy. But they did not talk about judicial philosophy; Mr. Rounds said he had thanked him for allowing the president to fulfill his part of the process.From there we went on and talked about hiking in the Black Hills and other opportunities, Mr. Rounds said.Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Democrat who said he had known Judge Garland for decades, dating to when Mr. Blumenthal was a United States attorney, said the judge seemed tentative when they met. But he brushed away the idea that Judge Garland feels discouraged.He knew he was getting into this situation, and he saw it as a service  and it is a service  to our country, he said. For him to endure this kind of grinding uncertainty and grilling, I think, is a service.The afternoon before the Senate recessed, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, one of the seven current Senate Republicans who voted in 1997 to approve Judge Garlands nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said he had decided to sit down with him out of respect for his work bringing justice to the victims of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Reflecting on the six weeks since Mr. Obama had named Judge Garland, Mr. Inhofe dismissed the notion that his nomination process, apparently leading nowhere, was odd.Doesnt seem strange to me, he said. I just dont know why were doing it.A few hours later, an email reached reporters: Having met with Judge Garland, Mr. Inhofe and Senator James Lankford, another Oklahoma Republican, said they remained opposed to considering his nomination.The three men had not even emerged from behind the thick wooden doors of Mr. Inhofes office."}
{"text": "Wall Street has been agog since last Thursday, when Donald Trump announced that Steven Mnuchin  who made his fortune at Goldman Sachs, worked for a firm funded by George Soros, and donated to Hillary Clinton  would be responsible for helping him raise $1 billion for Republicans and his own campaign.For if Mr. Trump is an unconventional political candidate, his appointment of Mr. Mnuchin as his national finance chairman is the epitome of just how unconventional this election has become. Despite what Mr. Mnuchin said was a personal friendship of 15 years, Mr. Trump has attacked both Mr. Mnuchins investment company  suing it in 2008 over a building deal  as well as Goldman Sachs, the Democratic Party and other institutions Mr. Mnuchin has supported.In a telephone interview Monday, Mr. Mnuchin emphasized the friendship part of the equation. I was there at the beginning when he decided to run for president, and Ive been a supporter and quiet adviser behind the scenes to him, he explained. The day after Mr. Trump won the New York primary, Mr. Trump called Mr. Mnuchin and offered him the job. I told him on the spot I would, he said.Mr. Mnuchin is known among Manhattans elite as part of one of the citys most influential families. His father, Robert Mnuchin, spent 30 years at Goldman Sachs, where he supervised equity trading and served on the management committee. He moved on to become an art dealer, and his Mnuchin Gallery on the Upper East Side has housed exhibitions of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning.The son left Goldman in 2002 and briefly worked for Eddie Lampert, his Yale roommate, who is chief executive of Sears. He later started Dune Capital Management, an investment firm known for being on the team that bailed out the failed housing lender IndyMac in 2009, buying it out of bankruptcy from the F.D.I.C. and renaming it OneWest.Mr. Mnuchin was the chairman of OneWest and sold it to CIT Group in 2015. Along the way, OneWest was involved in a string of lawsuits over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars.Meanwhile, Mr. Mnuchin made his name in Hollywood: He teamed up with Brett Ratner, the producer and director, and James Packer, the financier  together, better known as the RatPac  to produce movies like American Sniper and Mad Max: Fury Road. He briefly was co-chairman of the movie company Relativity Media, but  happily for him  he left before it went bankrupt.Mr. Mnuchins new job with Mr. Trump is filled with seeming contradictions. Mr. Trump spent much of his campaign attacking Goldman Sachs, using the bank to malign Ted Cruzs wife, Heidi, who is an investment manager there, and Mrs. Clinton, who famously received rich honorariums for giving speeches there. I know the guys at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Trump said during one debate, poking at Mr. Cruz. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton, he declared.Mr. Trump has also said he plans to end the so-called carried interest loophole that allows private equity executives and some hedge fund mangers to claim the lower capital gains rate, rather than the higher ordinary income rate, on much of their compensation. The issue was a hot button for Mitt Romney in 2012, as he benefited greatly from this regulation; Mr. Mnuchin, as the chairman of Dune, has done so as well.Mr. Mnuchin supported Mr. Romney in 2012; Mr. Romney has denounced Mr. Trump.Both Mr. Mnuchin and his new boss have backed Mrs. Clintons Democratic political aspirations in the past, though both now swear fealty to the other team.Im not a traditional fund-raiser  I think that was part of the appeal I had for Donald, Mr. Mnuchin told me on Monday. I have given to Democrats in the past. Ive always believed in supporting the best candidate at the time.What about Mr. Trumps broadsides against his former employer? Mr. Mnuchin emphasized that it was quite a while ago that he worked for Goldman, working there for 17 years but leaving in 2002. More recently, he said, Ive been focused on the West Coast economy and being a banker and lending in these markets.No doubt his connections will work to the benefit of the Republican Party, even during an election cycle when all the remaining candidates seem to be trying to sling mud at so-called fat cats. Not so Mr. Mnuchin.I wouldnt in any way say I distanced myself from Wall Street, he said. I have very good friends on Wall Street.The job could be considered high-risk for someone who hasnt lived in the glare of the public eye  and for someone backing as controversial a figure as Mr. Trump. With the exception of a handful of financiers like Carl Icahn, few big names on Wall Street have yet endorsed Mr. Trump.Indeed, many of the nations largest banks  including Goldman Sachs  havent done business with Mr. Trump in years. Among the lenders on Mr. Trumps disclosure form, only Merrill Lynch, among the countrys largest lenders, is listed for a loan made in 1993 and 1994. Since then, smaller banks or foreign institutions like UBS and Deutsche Bank are listed as his biggest lenders. According to former Goldman Sachs executives, the firm doesnt solicit business from Mr. Trump and has declined at least one project; a spokesman for the firm declined to comment.Mr. Mnuchin said, I dont think it is true that Goldman refuses to work with Mr. Trump. He added: There is a long, long list of some of the largest banks in the country that have done business with him. He has had no problem finding people who want to lend to his businesses.One of the lenders that have extended credit to Mr. Trump is Mr. Mnuchins Dune Capital. Dune was among a syndicate of lenders led by Deutsche Bank for the construction of his Trump International Hotel & Tower, a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago. Mr. Trump sued the lenders, including Dune, in 2008 to extend the terms of the loan on the basis of unprecedented financial crisis in the credit markets. The suit was later settled.Mr. Mnuchins firm was also involved in investing in Trump Waikiki in Hawaii. I havent really commented on what business weve done together, he said. I would describe it as more of a personal relationship than a professional relationship.Despite Mr. Trumps changing rhetoric, Mr. Mnuchin is bullish: Even on Wall Street, notwithstanding certain comments hes made and things like that, Ive gotten hundreds of calls from people who want to support him."}
{"text": "MUKACHEVO, Ukraine  Before gliding along trails or sliding down slopes, many of the worlds skis start at this bustling, sprawling factory in western Ukraine.Here, skilled machinists combine wobbly ribbons of carbon fiber and thin sheets of stiff titanium, stacking them like cake layers, and then heat-pressing, shaping and polishing them into finished slats for cross-country or downhill use.Here, too, craftworkers steam and bend wood into the sticks used by hockey players around the world under brand names that include Nike and Oxelo.The factorys Austrian owner, Fischer Sports, pays employees the equivalent of about $307 a month on average  perhaps one-eighth the amount that skilled woodworkers and machinists might earn in Fischers home country.And since January, when a new free-trade pact between Ukraine and the 28-country European Union took effect, Fischers costs have been further reduced by the elimination of tariffs on the machinery and raw materials flowing into the country and the finished goods that are shipped back out.The pay may seem paltry by Western standards, but the factorys 1,500 workers tend to see the jobs as an opportunity. Ukraine is one of the Northern Hemispheres poorest countries, with an economy that generates less than $3,100 a year per person.Europe is our future, said Yuri V. Oros, a machinist on the ski line.But that future is clouded by Ukraines recent troubled past, the countrys hostilities with Russia and the nationalism now threatening the solidarity of the European Union. In a recent nonbinding Netherlands referendum, for example, nearly two-thirds of Dutch voters urged their government to rescind its support of the Ukraine pact.And even as Fischer and some other multinational companies, including Nexans, a French maker of electrical wiring, have invested in Ukrainian operations to take advantage of the free-trade arrangement, many other companies are hesitant to venture into this former Soviet republic.So it is unclear how far any benefits of the trade pact might carry beyond the western edge of Ukraine near the Polish border, where most of these factories are situated, and into the broader economy in this country of 44.4 million, about 5 million of whom are now living in areas claimed by Russia or pro-Russian separatists.We will have episodic, anecdotal success stories, but its too early to call it a success, said Tymofiy S. Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics.Over all, Mr. Mylovanov said, Ukraines economy is barely growing, stunted by low labor productivity and widespread corruption. Only over the long run, he said, might the trade agreement help lift Ukrainians from poverty.The accord, called the European Union Association Agreement, has already had a tortured journey. After a former Ukrainian president rejected it in 2013, opting instead for a deal with Moscow, pro-Europe citizens took to the streets in Kiev in protests that led to a revolution.The new government in Kiev pivoted back to the European agreement, signing it in March 2014. But that same month Russia annexed the Ukrainian province of Crimea, inciting a Russian-backed civil war in eastern Ukraine.By the time the European Union trade pact took effect as scheduled, many Ukrainians were so distracted or demoralized by war and years of recession that they hardly noticed.Yet, here in Mukachevo, a picturesque town of cobble-paved roads and a 14th century hilltop castle left over from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Fischer plant provides a glimpse of what the future of greater European integration could mean for this country.Fischers Ukranian subsidiary, privately held, does not disclose financial figures for the factory. But executives say they expect benefits of the trade pact to add about 500,000 euros, or around $565,000, to the factorys profits this year.Ukraine has all the preconditions for investment, Vasyl Ryabych, the factorys director, said in an interview in his office, which overlooks the factorys groomed lawn surrounded by rose hedges.In the same way the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 spurred a surge of light-industry manufacturers  the so-called maquiladoras  along Mexicos border with the United States, the association agreement is meant to encourage development along Ukraines borders with the European Union. In turn, Ukraine is obliged to alter domestic economic policies through measures like overhauling the judiciary and changing rules for awarding state contracts.The Fischer plant is only one of the signs of foreign investment popping up around Lviv, the regional capital of western Ukraine.Nexans, the French company, recently rented land near Lviv where it plans to spend 120 million hryvnia, or about $4.7 million, on a factory that would put 2,000 people to work making automotive wire. Another Nexans plant in the region already makes wiring for BMW, General Motors and other carmakers.Leoni, a German competitor to Nexans, operates a factory in Stryi, in the Lviv region, making cables for Volkswagen, Opel, Porsche and others.And Fujikura, a Japanese car parts maker, last fall announced plans to open a factory in the next three years that would employ about 3,000 Ukrainians.The economy is orienting toward Europe, said Veronika Movchan, an economist at VoxUkraine, a research organization in Kiev.The tilt westward has increased Ukraines trade with the European Union to more than a third of the countrys total imports and exports, compared with less than a quarter in 2012.During that same span, however, Ukrainian exports to Russia fell by more than half, to 12.7 percent  a share that could slip further because Moscow has put tariffs on goods from Ukraine in retaliation for the European trade pact.And tariff-free trade with the European Union is a two-way street: As more European products compete with local goods, Ukraine might fall short of even its modest forecast of 1 percent growth this year, some economists now say.The trade pact also placed tight restrictions on agricultural imports into the European Union, despite agriculture being one of Ukraines strengths. The quotas for tariff-free honey imports are so low, for example, that Ukrainian beekeepers used them up in the first six weeks of the year.If Ukraine has any hope at all, it is agriculture, said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist for former Soviet states with Citi. But the fact that theyve used up most annual quotas already suggests this agreement is not having the desired effect.All the more reason that supporters of the trade pact are counting on continued success from the Fischer plant, which is already branching out beyond skis and hockey sticks.Having demonstrated its agility in handling carbon-fiber materials, and noting the regional growth in car parts, the factory has set up a workshop that takes on the labor-intensive work of polishing components for the auto industry.The sleek, lightweight parts include engine mounts for high-performance BMW M3 models and exterior panels for Audi, Porsche and Tesla. After the polishing, the parts are shipped back to wealthier markets.Were like China, said Mr. Ryabych, the factory director, but on the border with Europe."}
{"text": "I dont want to lay my case against conservative support for Donald Trump on too thick too soon, since there will be plenty of time to go around and around on the questionbetween hereand November. But one issueseems worth highlighting now, because its come up repeatedly in conversations with what you might call the Trump-curious among my friends and family and peers. Basically, when you makean argument like the one I made in my Sunday column, to the effect that a President Trumps likely governing style would raise the risks ofnational and global instability to an extent that trumps (if you will) many normal ideologicalconcerns, they tend to raise an eyebrow and say, compared to what?Compared to George W. Bush, who led us into a bloody quagmire in the Middle East and presided over the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression? Compared to Barack Obama, whos basically stood by and watched while that same Middle East has gone up in flames, plus Russias near-abroadand oh, maybe Europe too? Oh, and since youre worried about Trumps character  Compared to Bill Clinton, who possibly bombed foreign countries in order to distract from his sex scandal with an intern?Heres a Rod Dreher reader e-mailthat gets at a version of this argument; and heres a tweet from a writer I admire (I highly recommendhis essayon the state of science in the latest First Things) that distillsit to its essence: Will Wilson (@WAWilsonIV) May 7, 2016And this one as well, from a writer whose latest piece on Waugh is just great: Matthew Walther (@matthewwalther) May 10, 2016Now I am rarely accused of pollyannism (an obscure 8th-century Christian heresy, I believe), and I dont usually think of myself as someone who holds our ruling class in particularly high regard. But the Trump phenomenonhas exposed animportant dividing line within what you might call the pessimism-based community: Pessimists all look at the governance of the West and think, well, this is pretty bad, butwe dont all agree on how and whether and how easily it could get much, much worse.In my own case, because I tend to see Western society as stuck in a decadent loop rather than on the skids toward total calamity, I also tend to give our elites some credit for not being total calamities themselves, and I tend to see movements like Trumpism that promise Total Disruption as offering a cure worse than the disease. Whereas some of my more declinist friends (perhaps including this Trump delegate ?) are more Trump-curious because they think the disease is further advanced, that calamity looms no matter what, or that see above under Bush and Obama it has already come upon us.This is not a disagreement that can be adjudicated perfectly, since it requires comparing our existing politicians, many of whom are indeed venal and incompetent, to an entirely hypothetical Trump era. But provisionally I would invite the Trump-curious to think about the two signal crises of the Bush years, 9/11 and the financial crisis, and imagine each one with Donald Trump installed as president of the United States.In the first instance, you can imagine a better outcome than the one we had: Perhaps Trumps (alleged) skepticism about the Iraq War and zeal for winning would have manifested itself in a more restrained and tightly-focused post-9/11 response, perhaps we would have caught or killed Bin Laden sooner andbrought our troops home in a victory parade, perhaps phrases like Abu Ghraib and waterboarding would have never entered our national lexicon.But remembering the post-9/11 atmosphere (and, indeed, my own psychic state at the time), it also seems very easy to imagine a response that was much, much worse more reckless, more bloodthirsty, more extra-constitutional, and ultimately more disastrous for our military, the innocent, the world.Recall, especially, that for all the talk at the time and after about Bushs fascism, etc., the Bush administration spent a lot of time trying to tamp down backlash at home (mosque visits, yes; internment camps, no) and working within institutional frameworks that imposed some limits on its actions. Both of its wars (unlike our Obama-era adventures) were debated and approved by Congress, a great deal of time was spent trying to work through the United Nations, the invasion of Iraq was a coalition effort even if it was only of the willing, High Cheneyism was pressed by one faction of the executive branch but resisted by others,and so on.None of this prevented the war from being a mistake and then a debacle, and if youre preparing an indictment of the American governing class the fact that so many centrists and reasonable liberals went along with the Bush administrations case for war can be invoked in a case for disruption, a case for #TrumpNow. (As can the fact that many #NeverTrump voices on the right seem not to have reckoned fully with what Bushism wrought.)But its also pretty easy, especially given some ofthe precedents created by President Obamas foreign forays and drone wars, to imagine how a future American president might respond to a 9/11-style attack by ignoring institutional restraints entirely, and simply lashing out with blood and fire. Especially if that American president had, I dunno, explicitly campaigned on promises to kill them and take the oil, to murder terrorist families, to disfavor and discriminate against Muslims as a class during a time of terror, etc. Which is why, in the end, a rigorous case for Trump needs to be very comfortablewith that possibility (as some of his supporters are!), comfortable with fire and blood as an alternative to George W. Bushs far-too-timid crawl to war and overlawyered enhanced interrogations, rather than assuming because Bushs foreign policy went bad a far higher degree of recklessness and folly isnt possible.Then regarding the financial crisis well, there my take is a lot shorter. No doubt the Bush administration (and the Clinton administration before it) made mistakes that made the crisis worse when it came; no doubt the Washington-New York response was imperfect and created all kinds of problems down the road. But to believethat the aftermath of Lehmans collapse couldnt have been muchbleaker with a more feckless and volatile president at the helm and a more hackish cast around him, that the Bush administrations response was the worst of all possible options rather than among the least-bad, requires ignoring a lot of very dark economic history that we were lucky not to actually revisit. There issome chance that America and the world would have been better off had Donald Trump been president on 9/11 rather than Bush. But the chances that we would have been better off in 2008, 2009 and 2010 (and into the present) drop very low indeed.Ill leave off there, while noting that Ive made an earlier version of this argument that touches on the immigration issue as well. Again, well have plenty of time to wrestle with these questionsover the next six months. But in the pessimist community generally, and the world of dissident, anti-Bush conservatives especially, this strikes me as the core problem that need to be reckoned with by anyone who wants to make a strong case for supporting Donald Trump for the sake of #disrupting our decadent elite.Its not enough to note that things are bad now, that our bipartisan leaders and especially the Republican Partys leaders have often marched with folly. You need to address head-on the ways in which a President Trump seems like a man whose instincts, inclinations and explicit promises could make that march of folly ever so much swifter, ever so much worse."}
{"text": "The 61st annual Eurovision song contest, the campiest event on the international cultural calendar, arrives at its glorious climax this week. Beloved by Europeans, although mystifying to many in the United States, the contest was conceived as a way to unite Cold War Europe through music  a kind of World Cup for pop songs  and to bolster ratings for national broadcasters. Over the years, countries as varied as Israel and the nascent Balkan republics have vied to enter, seeing participation as a sign of acceptance on the world stage. This years contest is in Stockholm, where performers from 42 countries will compete for the top prize  exposure  in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday and finals on Saturday.Who are the entrants?Most Eurovision participants come from countries in the European Broadcasting Union, a conglomerate of broadcasters from across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Last year, Australia, which has a large Eurovision fan base and always loves a party, brokered a deal to participate, and they will be back. Last year, roughly 200 million people tuned in to the finals, far more than the Super Bowls average of 110 million viewers.Each year, the festival is in the country that won the previous years award. Swedens Mans Zelmerlow won last year in Vienna with Heroes. How participants are chosen varies by country. Sweden, land of consensus, hosts Melodifestivalen, a monthslong song contest, to choose its participant. Other countries use juries from the music industry. Participants from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain automatically jump to the finals because their national broadcasters contribute the most funding.What are the rules?Eurovisions byzantine voting rules have evolved as organizers have tried to make voting more fair and more suspenseful. This year, the rules were overhauled yet again. Winners will be chosen by votes from professional judges in each country, combined with votes from viewers.Whos hot this year?The 18-year-old singer Jamie-Lee Kriewitz stepped in to represent Germany after an outcry over that countrys original entrant, Xavier Naidoo, a pop star who drew criticism because of apparent ties to right-wing politics. Ms. Kriewitz, whose look is inspired by Japanese manga and whose sound evokes Lana Del Rey, will compete with her love song, Ghost.In only its second year competing, Australia has a front-runner: Dami Ims Sound of Silence, widely considered one of the best entries in the lineup. That song, too, stirred controversy, for the lyric trying to feel your love through face time. Some claimed that the song referenced Apples FaceTime video chat technology and violated the contests ban on commercial lyrics, but conference organizers ruled that the lyrics of the Australian song are presented as two separate words, face time and not FaceTime, which is an Apple trademark.Russias entrant, Sergey Lazarev, built his reputation as part of the pop duo Smash!!, which crooned romance songs in the early 2000s, including numbers in French and English. His You Are the Only One is part love ballad, part rock anthem. The video features frenzied digital animation and fire-breathing background dancers.Ukraines entrant, Jamala, is a Ukrainian Tatar, whose song 1944 seems to refer to the mistreatment of that ethnic minority group by Soviet forces in the waning years of World War II.The song has sparked controversy in Russia, where some say it violates the contests ban on political songs.Frances entrant, Amir, is a likely front-runner with his debut single, Jai Cherch (I Searched). The song has a catchy beat and an uplifting, if vague, message (Youre the one thats making me strong, Amir sings, like the melody of my song). Amir, who has Tunisian and Moroccan ancestry, represents a multicultural France. After the November terrorist attacks, whose targets included a Paris concert hall, solidarity with France is expected to be strong.What is victory worth?Over the decades, only a few Eurovision winners have hit it really big with their songs, including Abbas Waterloo in 1974 and Celine Dions Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi in 1988. (Ms. Dion, from Quebec, represented Switzerland.) The Riverdance spectacle, from Ireland, started as a halftime show when Ireland hosted the competition in 1994. Back in 1958, the Italian song Nel Blu Dipinto di Blu (popularly known as Volare), by Domenico Modugno, was a Eurovision finalist.What are its big controversies?This year, Romania was expelled from the competition after failing to pay a $16.3 million debt it owed to the European Broadcast Union, which was not nearly as exciting as the last big flap, in 2013, when Azerbaijan was accused of bribing judges and paying Lithuanian students to call in and vote for its contestant. In 2009, Georgia withdrew after controversy over its song We Dont Wanna Put In, which was performed shortly after the 2009 armed conflict between Georgia and Russia. Some read the title as a reference to Vladimir V. Putin, then the Russian prime minister and now the president.Why is everyone so into it?National pride, friendly competition between countries that once went to war, an appetite for kitsch, schadenfreude, questionable taste  the reasons for applauding Eurovision are numerous. Its like the Oscar gala, but with more of a freak show and fun in it and more politics, said Anna Charlotta Gunnarson, a Swedish radio host and die-hard Eurovision fan who has written books on the contest.How can I watch it?Viewers in the participating countries can watch on television domestically and viewers around the world can watch on Eurovisions website, eurovision.tv. The semifinals and the finals begin at 9 p.m. Central European Time, or 3 p.m. Eastern Time. For the first time this year, the finals will be broadcast on television (and the Internet) in the United States, by Logo, a channel owned by Viacom."}
{"text": "Benjamin Franklin once pointed out that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. Evading taxes and shielding ill-gotten gains are an effort to avoid some of that certainty, but as much as the government tries to battle corruption in the financial system, it will almost never be enough.In the wake of the disclosure of confidential documents known as the Panama Papers showing how lawyers set up shell companies to hide assets, the White House announced initiatives last week to combat shady practices used by corrupt officials, tax cheats, and other criminals.Like other well-intentioned steps to fight corruption, they will make it a little bit harder to shift money around anonymously, but ultimately will be only a modest impediment to stanching the flood of illicit funds that course through the economy.The challenge to changing the misuse of corporate forms is that the ability to start a shell company is deeply embedded in the legal system. A video posted recently shows a cats owner going to a firm to set up a limited liability company in Delaware for the feline in less than five minutes just by paying the $249 fee and entering minimal identifying information.If it involves a cat, it shows how remarkably easy it is to create an anonymous entity that can be used for almost any purpose, whether nefarious or benign.The Treasury Department adopted a final rule requiring financial institutions, like banks and brokers, to verify the identity of beneficial owners of 25 percent or more of a company when it opens an account. In addition, there must be monitoring of the account, which includes reporting any suspicious activity. The regulation will be phased in over two years, so do not be surprised to see a rush to open accounts before the reporting requirement kicks in.It also announced proposed regulations that would require a foreign-owned single-member limited liability company to obtain an employer identification number from the Internal Revenue Service to report any taxable income. This type of L.L.C. is used frequently in high-end real estate transactions, which The New York Times described extensively in the Towers of Secrecy series about how numerous foreigners use corporate facades to buy Manhattan condominiums. If adopted, the new rules will pull back slightly the veil of secrecy surrounding these entities because it will allow the government to track transactions and provide information to other countries trying to crack down on tax cheating.How much of a barrier the new Treasury Department rules will erect to the misuse of shell companies to hide assets remains to be seen. Ownership of a L.L.C. or other corporate entity could be divided among five holders, none crossing the 25 percent threshold, to stay below the customer information requirement. The use of nominees holding purported interests in a shell can still take place to shield the true owners identity, although perhaps if the same names appear on regulatory filings with some regularity then investigators will at least have a lead on who to scrutinize.The Justice Department announced that it would submit proposals to Congress to make it easier to pursue transnational corruption. One change would expand the list of crimes that can be a predicate for a money laundering charge against a foreign official who engages in corruption and transfers funds through the United States. A second would allow prosecutors to issue administrative subpoenas in a money laundering investigation rather than just using criminal grand jury subpoenas to obtain banking records, allowing information in some cases to be gathered more quickly.A third proposal would make it easier for the Justice Department to introduce the records obtained from foreign banks in court, relaxing the requirements under the rules of evidence for submission of these documents.A more radical step is legislation the Treasury Department is preparing to require that newly formed companies disclose their beneficial owners to the federal government. There are already bills in the House and Senate that would require similar information be reported, but so far they have not gone anywhere. The United States Chamber of Commerce and American Bar Association fought efforts in prior years to pass legislation on this issue, although perhaps the disclosure of the Panama Papers will mute some of that opposition.The legislative proposals will require approval by Congress, which may not be likely during the run up to the November elections when few bills are likely to be considered unless they are urgent.There is also the question of whether requiring greater disclosure of who controls a corporate entity goes too far in denigrating the privacy rights of the owners. There are legitimate reasons to hide ones wealth from public disclosure, especially in those parts of the world where that information could make one a target for extortion or kidnapping. Just because a criminal can use a corporate shell to hide ill-gotten gains does not necessarily mean that most, or even many, of these entities are used for illegitimate reasons.Balancing the needs of law enforcement with the privacy interests of individuals is always difficult, as the recent fight over iPhone encryption between Apple and the Justice Department amply demonstrates. How far the need to gather information on the identity of owners should go is an issue Congress will have to settle.Even if President Obama gets everything on the wish list of changes being suggested, there remains the problem of how effective they would be in fighting corruption. Money is like water, following the path of least resistance. Impediments to anonymously transferring and holding assets may slow the flow in the short term, but are unlikely to put much of a dent in how illicit funds move through the financial system because there always seem to be new avenues to hide their ownership.That does not mean that pushing for greater transparency in the ownership of assets and making it easier to prosecute money laundering are not worth the effort. But the proposed changes should be seen for what they are  small steps in a continuing battle."}
{"text": "Bernie Sanders thrilled enthusiastic backers Tuesday with a double-digit win in West Virginias presidential primary, and a vow to win the Democratic nomination, no matter how unlikely that seems.Donald Trump notched two unopposed wins in West Virginia and Nebraska, moving closer to his inevitable, most likely uncontested nomination.Mr. Sanders was beating Hillary Clinton by more than 14 points on Tuesday, with about 70 percent of the vote counted. Mr. Sanders did surprisingly well among female voters, who voted for him in greater proportions than in any other state except his home state of Vermont, according to CNN exit polls.Mrs. Clinton won West Virginia in 2008, beating Barack Obama by more than 40 points. But she stumbled there this year aftershe touted her green energy plans by saying,Were gonna put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Coal mining employs thousands in West Virginia, and the state has already suffered high unemployment with the decline of the industry. Mrs. Clinton apologized but the damage was done.Mr. Sanders is on a roll. He won Indiana on May 3, and has a strong base of support among Democrats in Kentucky and Oregon, who vote on May 17. While Sanders supporters were buoyed by Tuesdays result, he is likely to win only a handful more delegates than Mrs. Clinton, who has yet to clinch the nomination but has a formidable lead. The Sanders camp is determined to end the race on a hot streak and turn his candidacy into a cause, shaping the partys platform in favor of the hard-pressed white, middle-class and young voters who have backed him so strongly.We have now won primaries and caucuses in 19 states, and let me be as clear as I can be: We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination, Mr. Sanders told hundreds of cheering supporters at a rally in Salem, Ore. We are going to fight for every last vote. He then went on to describe how he would beat Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, the only remaining Republican candidate in the race, won West Virginia with more than 75 percent of the vote, with about 65 percent of the vote counted. In Nebraska, with about half of the vote counted, Mr. Trump had about 60 percent. The lopsided result seemed to refute any speculation that voters would recoil at the prospect of a Trump presidency after Mr. Trump all-but-secured the Republican nomination when he won the Indiana primary.Mr. Trump has been whipsawing between trying to appear presidential, and lashing out in his usual sophomoric fashion, both on the trail and on Twitter. On Tuesday night, Mr. Trumps statement was subdued: It is a great honor to have won both West Virginia and Nebraska, especially by such massive margins. My time spent in both states was a wonderful and enlightening experience for me. But that comes a few days after he engaged in a battle of words with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, calling her Goofy Elizabeth Warren. The next non-electoral test for Mr. Trump will come on Thursday when he meets with Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, who has said he is not yet ready to embrace Mr. Trump as the nominee."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  With California entering its fifth year of a statewide drought, Gov. Jerry Brown moved on Monday to impose permanent water conservation measures and called on water suppliers to prepare for a future made drier by climate change.Under the governors executive order, emergency drought regulations, like bans on hosing down driveways or watering lawns within 48 hours of a rainstorm, will remain indefinitely. Urban water suppliers will be required to report their water use to the state each month and develop plans to get through long-term periods of drought.Despite winter rains that replenished reservoirs and eased dry conditions in parts of Northern California, Mr. Brown suggested that the drought may never entirely end, and that the state needed to adapt to life with less water.Californians stepped up during this drought and saved more water than ever before, Mr. Brown said in a statement. But now we know that drought is becoming a regular occurrence and water conservation must be a part of our everyday life.Californians have reduced their water use by 23.9 percent, compared with 2013 levels, since the governor ordered a 25 percent statewide cutback last year. With rain brought on by El Nio in recent months, some water agencies have clamored for an end to rationing. One affluent San Francisco Bay Area water agency announced that it would stop publishing the names of its most egregious water wasters, while another district has warned residents that they will soon face fines again for letting lawns go brown.Ninety percent of the state remains in drought, down from 97 percent two months ago, according to the United States Drought Monitor.In the short term, some water suppliers may indeed get a reprieve from the states mandate. The State Water Resources Control Board, which put emergency regulations in place during the drought, has proposed allowing each water district to develop its own conservation plans, based on what its water supplies would be if the drought continued for three more years. For example, an agency that projected a 10 percent shortfall three years out would be required to cut back water use by 10 percent. The state will review each districts plan.Other statewide conservation measures would also be eliminated from last years emergency rules, like restrictions on hotels and restaurants offering water to guests. A vote on the plan is scheduled for later this month.Conditions have changed this year. While were certainly in a statewide drought, drought conditions have eased, said Mark Cowin, director of the California Department of Water Resources. Some local communities have seen a great easing of their drought effects this year, and will see life return more to normal.But, he added, were just one dry winter away from returning to where we were.Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the states Water Resources Control Board, said the proposed regulations were part of a shift toward focusing on long-term water conservation, even during wet years, with the assumption that the state would continue to grow drier over the next century. A state law, enacted in 2009, already requires a 20 percent reduction in per capita water use, but officials are now pushing for even further conservation.Our emphasis is on conservation as a way of life in California, Ms. Marcus said. Weve had the luxury of taking our precious water for granted in the past, but we do not anymore."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  On the morning of March 13, 2011, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, Jeffrey D. Feltman, wrote an urgent email to more than two dozen colleagues informing them that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were sending troops into Bahrain to put down antigovernment protests there.Mr. Feltmans email prompted a string of 10 replies and forwards over the next 24 hours, including to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the Obama administration debated what was happening and how to respond.The chain contained information now declared classified, including portions of messages written by Mr. Feltman; the former ambassador in Kuwait, Deborah K. Jones; and the current director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John O. Brennan.The top administration officials discussed the Bahrain situation on unclassified government computer networks, except for Mrs. Clinton, who used a private email server while serving as secretary of state.Her server is now the subject of an F.B.I. investigation, which is likely to conclude in the next month, about whether classified information was mishandled.Whatever the disposition of the investigation, the discussion of troops to Bahrain reveals how routinely sensitive information is emailed on unclassified government servers, reflecting what many officials describe as diplomacy in the age of the Internet, especially in urgent, fast-developing situations.A review of the 30,322 emails from Mrs. Clintons private server that the State Department has made public under the Freedom of Information Act provides an extensive record of how such sensitive information often looped throughout President Obamas foreign policy apparatus on unclassified systems, from embassies to the United Nations to the White House.The senders included Denis R. McDonough, currently the White House chief of staff and previously the deputy national security adviser, and Susan E. Rice, the former American representative at the United Nations who is now Mr. Obamas national security adviser.Many of the emails were sent over the State Departments unclassified system, state.gov, which is considered secure but not at the level of the State Departments system for emailing classified information.At the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House, among other agencies, officials have two systems for email, one for classified messages and one for more routine business. They are nicknamed the high side and the low side.Mrs. Clintons private server  set up in her home in Westchester County, N.Y.  was assumed to be even less secure than the State Departments low side, although the unclassified servers at some government agencies have been hacked in recent years.One result of Mrs. Clintons decision to maintain a private server is that it has put State Department officials on the defensive about their use of state.gov for some business that might be considered classified.Of the 30,322 emails made public, 2,028 have had portions redacted and are now classified at the lowest level of classification, confidential.Nearly three-quarters of those emails were classified because they contained what is called foreign government information  a vast category of information, gathered through conversations and meetings with foreign counterparts that are the fundamentals of diplomacy, but which had to be protected when the emails were released.Last week, in an apparent attempt to dispel criticism that many of the emails were improperly sent, a top State Department official argued in a letter to three Senate Democrats that the nations diplomats and officials were in fact allowed to send foreign government information through the governments unclassified computer systems.Department officials of necessity routinely receive such information through unclassified channels, said the letter, dated May 2 and written by the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, Julia Frifield.For example, diplomats engage in meetings with counterparts in open settings, have phone calls with foreign contacts over unsecure lines, and email with and about foreign counterparts via unclassified systems.The letter went on to say that using foreign government information in unclassified emails does not amount to mishandling the information.The State Department, unlike some other federal agencies, does not have the authority to redact that category of information even if it is required to release documents under the Freedom of Information Act.Thus, the only way the State Department could withhold foreign government information in the emails being released under court order was to classify it, according to the letter.The letter was a reply to one sent in March to Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Dianne Feinstein of California. A copy was given to The New York Times by a government official who believed the classification of the emails was unfairly implicating diplomats and other officials conducting diplomacy in the modern era.Of the 30,322 emails, the F.B.I.s investigation has focused on a smaller number, including 22 that the C.I.A. insisted contained information classified top secret.Those emails have not been released, even with redactions, because they include material classified at the highest levels, known as top secret/SAP, according to a letter from  the inspector general of the nations intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III.That designation refers to special access programs, which are among the nations most guarded secrets. The emails are said to include references to, among other things, the C.I.A.s program to hunt and kill suspected terrorists with armed drones in Pakistan.An additional 65 emails, which have been released, have had portions redacted because they included information classified at the level of secret.One exchange of emails typical of those now classified because they contain foreign government information involved Mr. McDonough, Ms. Rice and her deputy at the time, Rosemary A. DiCarlo, and the Palestinian effort in September 2011 to be recognized as a state by the United Nations.The exchange included eight separate emails, all sent on unclassified networks. Of those, six were redacted almost completely when the State Department released them in January.According to the subject line and what information does appear, the three discussed deliberations between the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Ms. Rices discussion with the Palestinian representative at the United Nations, Riyad H. Mansour, on the bid for statehood  all instances of foreign government information.The chain of emails eventually encompassed 16 officials, including political appointees and career diplomats, and was ultimately forwarded to Mrs. Clintons inbox by Jake Sullivan, her deputy then and now the senior policy adviser for her election campaign.Philip H. Gordon, an assistant secretary of state under Mrs. Clinton, said, If all these respected, senior foreign service officers and experienced ambassadors are sending these emails, then this issue is not about how Hillary Clinton managed her email, but how the State Department communicates in the 21st century.Mr. Gordon, later a special assistant to the president for the Middle East, wrote more than 40 emails that were redacted on the grounds that they contained classified information.Mrs. Clinton herself wrote, responded to or forwarded 96 emails that have been classified in part, including one that is classified secret; 46 of those contained the foreign government information that the departments letter addressed.There are, to be sure, other emails that do not fall into the category of foreign government information, and some raise questions about the sort of information senior officials sent in unclassified emails.In 18 emails, for example, information has been classified on the grounds that it identifies C.I.A. officials, including two instances that are now considered secret.One of those was a seemingly benign photo opportunity listed on Mrs. Clintons daily schedule, with the person who gave her a daily intelligence briefing, making it obvious that the person was an agency employee.That email was originally released as confidential but upgraded to secret, probably reflecting that the person holds an undercover position now.Another exchange involving the C.I.A. came the day after David H. Petraeus resigned as the agencys director in November 2012. Mr. Brennan, then still at the White House, sent an email  detailing the provisions for Mr. Petraeuss personal security following his surprise resignation  to Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. Obamas national security adviser. Mr. Donilon then forwarded it to Mrs. Clinton.Madam Secretary  Attached is an update on the security for Dave P., he wrote. The entirety of Mr. Brennans note has now been redacted and classified as confidential on the grounds that it involves vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security.Mr. Petraeus ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for keeping highly classified information in eight black notebooks he kept in his home, including such details as the names of covert officers and programs, and sharing them with his biographer and lover.A spokesman at the C.I.A., Ryan Trapani, said in a statement that Mr. Brennan had believed that the information he sent in the email was unclassified.When operating in a position like he was at the White House, officials often have to make spot judgments about whether information is classified or not, he wrote.In most cases, the determinations are correct, but in some situations, another agency may consider certain information classified that the author does not."}
{"text": "ESPN and Verizon announced Tuesday the settlement of a lawsuit that accused Verizon of breaching its contract with the sports network when it created a new cable package for its Fios television service last year.No details of the settlement were announced.In a statement, Terry Denson, Verizons vice president of content strategy and acquisition, said: ESPN is an important partner of ours. We look forward to working with them to provide great content to consumers for years to come.In the same statement, Sean Breen, senior vice president for affiliate sales for the Disney and ESPN media networks, said, We look forward to further collaborating with them to deliver customers content across all of our platforms.ESPN filed suit in New York Supreme Court in April 2015 after Verizon moved some channels off Fioss basic cable offering  including ESPN, Lifetime, TBS, USA Network and Comedy Central  and separated them into category-specific, $10-a-month programming tiers like sports, pop culture, entertainment and children that customers could choose from.At the time, ESPN said in a statement that it was at the forefront of embracing innovative ways to deliver high-quality content and value to consumers on multiple platforms but that must be done in compliance with our agreements.The lawsuit struck at the longstanding practice of bundling channels into broad, increasingly expensive cable packages that consumers have begun to rebel against by abandoning their pay-TV providers and choosing lower-priced Internet services like Netflix, Hulu and Sling TV.ESPN is the most expensive cable network, so Fioss Custom TV lineup was an attempt to create a skinny bundle that would keep customers from fleeing.In defending itself against ESPN, Verizon said, Consumers have spoken loud and clear that they want choice and the industry should be focused on giving consumers what they want.In February, with the lawsuit barely advancing in court, there appeared to be a thaw in the relations between ESPN and Verizon that suggested that a settlement was imminent. Verizon overhauled Custom TV, turning it into two plans that are essentially parallel basic cable packages. The first, Essentials, has no sports channels. The second, Sports & More, includes ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.ESPN said then that it was encouraged by the changes. But a Verizon spokesman said the changes were not made to accelerate a settlement but to adapt to consumers buying habits."}
{"text": "Michael S. Harper, whose allusive, jazz-inflected poems interwove his personal experiences as a black man with an expansive view of a history shared by black and white Americans, and who was a finalist for the National Book Award in poetry in 1978, died on Saturday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 78.His death was confirmed by his daughter, Rachel Harper, who did not specify the cause.Mr. Harpers abundant gifts were on display in one of his earliest poems, Dear John, Dear Coltrane, an elegy composed just before the saxophonist John Coltranes death in 1967. In compressed, sinuous lines, it wound its way to the aching words The inflated heart/pumps out, the tenor kiss,/tenor love by way of a startling interlude:Why you so black? cause I am why you so funky? cause I am why you so black? cause I am why you so sweet? cause I am why you so black? cause I ama love supreme, a love supreme.Mr. Harper had submitted the poem, along with others, to a poetry competition judged by Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Penn Warren and Denise Levertov. Although they failed to win the grand prize, they were published at the urging of Ms. Brooks by the University of Pittsburgh Press in 1970 as Dear John, Dear Coltrane.Mr. Harper went on to publish another dozen poetry collections, deepening his study of history  his own and that of eminent black Americans like Jackie Robinson, Ralph Ellison and Dexter Gordon  in a series of expanding circles that embraced ever wider swaths of the nations past.His complex notion of genealogy allowed him, in works like History Is Your Own Heartbeat (1971), Photographs, Negatives: History as Apple Tree (1972), Images of Kin (1977) and Honorable Amendments (1995), to lay claim to figures as varied as Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island; the Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston; the abolitionist John Brown; and, in the poem Study Windows, two anonymous German immigrant craftsmen. His work stood out, the poet Rita Dove wrote in The Washington Post in 2000, for its cleareyed and compassionate dealings with the hard news of life.Michael Steven Harper was born on March 18, 1938, in Brooklyn and grew up in the boroughs Bedford-Stuyvesant section. His father, Walter, was a post office supervisor. His mother, the former Katherine Johnson, was a medical secretary.His parents extensive record collection kindled a lifelong passion for jazz, a musical form that Mr. Harper saw as integral to his sense of language and poetry.In a preface to his poems in The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, he wrote, My poems are rhythmic rather than metric; the pulse is jazz; the tradition generally oral; my major influences musical; my debts, mostly to the musicians who taught me to see about experience, pain and love, and who made it artful and archetypal.When he was 13 his family moved to Los Angeles, where he attended Dorsey High School. After graduating in 1955 he enrolled in pre-med courses at Los Angeles City College but gravitated toward literature, earning an associate of arts degree in 1959. He pursued English studies at the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences (now California State University, Los Angeles), earning a bachelors degree in 1961 and a masters degree in 1963.I was writing plays, one-acters, about musicians who were speakers of the idiom I loved most: black American male speech, full of curse words, he wrote in an autobiographical essay for the reference work Contemporary Authors in 2004.Among his teachers was the British writer Christopher Isherwood, who occasionally brought in his friends W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender. Mr. Harper, already deep into Keats and the Romantics, began to see poetry as a vocation, an inclination that hardened into conviction after he was accepted into the Iowa Writers Workshop, where he earned an M.F.A. degree in 1963.While teaching English at Contra Costa College in San Pablo, Calif., he began publishing his poems in small magazines. In 1968, he was named poet in residence at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore., and he also taught at Reed College there. In 1970, after teaching at California State College (now University) in Hayward, he joined the English faculty at Brown University, where he remained until retiring in 2013.In addition to the poetry collections Debridement (1973) and Nightmare Begins Responsibility (1974), Mr. Harper edited The Collected Poems of Sterling A. Brown (1980) and, with Robert B. Stepto, Chant of Saints: A Gathering of Afro-American Literature, Art and Scholarship (1979). His collection Images of Kin was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1978 and won the Poetry Society of Americas Melville-Cane Award.In 1989, he became Rhode Islands first state poet, a post he held for five years.Mr. Harpers only marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Harper, who lived in Providence, R.I., is survived by two sons, Roland and Patrice, and two granddaughters.Ive been called a black poet, revolutionary poet, a black aesthetic poet, an academic poet, an ameliorating poet  you name it, Mr. Harper told The Washington Post in 1978. Ive never made any attempt to qualify out the black content in my poetry. Ive written poems about a good many things. Ive tried to keep my range of experience as wide as possible."}

In a one-time warehouse for Canal Hi-Fi, on Mercer where Howard Street ends (or begins, depending on your point of view), the showroom has never before been open to the public. Its 4,000 square feet spread over three floors, so theres a lot of places to show lights, Miller says.

{"text": "WASHINGTON  Down the hallway from the secretary of the Armys offices on the third floor of the Pentagon, Eric Fanning spends his days sitting in a nondescript room with several empty desks. Unlike the secretarys offices, which have floor to ceiling windows and views of the monuments on the National Mall, Mr. Fannings office looks out on limestone walls that form one of the inner rings of the Pentagon.Mr. Fanning is stuck in that office and has little to do all day because his nomination to be the secretary of the Army  the highest-ranking civilian position in the largest branch of the military  is stalled in Congress. Senate Republicans have successfully blocked many of President Obamas appointees since they took over control from the Democrats in 2015. Mr. Fanning has stood out because there are few questions about his qualifications, but he is being held up by just one senator. If confirmed, Mr. Fanning will be the highest-ranking openly gay Pentagon official.Standing in the way of that happening is Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, who has placed a hold on his nomination, insisting that the Obama administration tell him that it will not move any detainees from Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, to Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Although few administration officials believe the base is a viable option, the Obama administration, which is determined to close the facility by the time the president leaves office in January, has balked at giving Mr. Roberts any assurances.Nevertheless, some Senate Republicans have said Mr. Roberts is being unreasonable and should allow Mr. Fannings nomination to move forward. In an unusual alliance, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a longtime Republican adversary of Mr. Obama, has fought to get Mr. Fanning, 47, confirmed. After he tried for weeks to persuade Mr. Roberts in private to allow Mr. Fannings nomination to move forward, the tension between Mr. McCain and Mr. Roberts  whom Mr. McCain calls a very good friend  spilled out on the Senate floor at the end of last month.Mr. McCain said it was unfair to hold up Mr. Fannings nomination, because he would have no role in what happened to the detainees, but Mr. Roberts refused to back down.Mr. Fannings nomination is being closely watched by many in the gay community. Under Mr. Obama, the military ended the dont ask, dont tell policy that barred openly gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from military service. And, senior Pentagon officials are studying how to incorporate transgender people into the services.Many in the gay community believe Mr. Fannings confirmation will be another step forward for gays in the military, but they are concerned about why the process has taken so long.Whats baffling about this is that Eric has bipartisan support from all corners and nobody disputes his qualifications, record of service or leadership, which is rare in such a high-profile job, said Chad Griffin, the chairman of Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group.Although he never served in the military, Mr. Fanning has served in high-level jobs in all three services.He started out of college as a low-level staff member on the House Armed Services Committee. When the committees chairman, Representative Les Aspin, was appointed defense secretary by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Mr. Fanning went with him.But after Mr. Aspin later resigned, Mr. Fanning has said, he did not think there was a future for him in national security in Washington, and he left government and moved to New York.Over the next decade, Mr. Fanning worked at CBS as a foreign news editor, for a private strategic communications firm and as an executive at a national security think tank. In 2008, he took a job as the deputy director of a commission studying the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Since then, he has served in a series of senior Pentagon positions  deputy under secretary of the Navy, acting secretary of the Air Force, under secretary of the Air Force and then the first chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter.After Mr. Obama nominated him to be the secretary of the Army, he served as acting secretary until stepping aside in January in the face of complaints from Mr. McCain that serving on an acting basis was a way around the nomination process.Later that month, Mr. McCain invited Mr. Fanning to testify before the Armed Services Committee, which approved his nomination and sent it to the Senate floor in March. At that point, Pentagon officials believed Mr. Fanning would receive a vote within days. But Mr. Roberts then reaffirmed a commitment to place a hold on his nomination until he received an assurance from the administration about the detainees.He has completed all the requirements and come through the committee, Mr. McCain said in an interview, and he would have no authority whatsoever over the issue of where to relocate the prisoners who are being held at Guantnamo.In response to questions about Mr. Fannings nomination, a spokeswoman for Mr. Roberts referred a reporter to statements he had made on the floor. Mr. Roberts said in the statements that he had no issue with Mr. Fanning, but was concerned about the security of the men and women working at Fort Leavenworth and living in the region if the detainees were moved there.This happens quite often where you have a hold, but it usually resolves itself when the senator has made their point, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said Mr. Fanning was probably the most qualified nominee the Obama administration had put forward for a Pentagon position in recent years.The point has been made, and were now getting pretty late in the administration, Mr. Harrison said. If hes not confirmed soon, it wont make much sense for him or the Army to go forward.Mr. Fanning declined to comment on Tuesday about his confirmation prospects. The White House and Senator McCain are working on this very hard, and they prefer that nominees stay in a radio silent mode, he said."}
{"text": "LONDON  Credit Suisse said on Tuesday that it had lost money in the first quarter as turbulence hurt its global markets and investment banking business.Tidjane Thiam, who joined Credit Suisse as chief executive in July, is in the middle of an extensive  overhaul of the Swiss bank, shrinking its investment bank and placing greater emphasis on its wealth-management business, particularly in Asia and other emerging markets.Mr. Thiam announced an acceleration of those efforts in March after he said that top executives had been surprised by the size of large, risky positions in the banks trading book.The lenders turnaround has not been helped by turmoil in the financial markets, which have cut into results across the industry and sent Credit Suisse last year to its first annual loss since 2008.In the first three months of the year, Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, reported a loss of 302 million Swiss francs, or about $311 million. The bank reported a profit of 1.05 billion francs in the first quarter of 2015.The Swiss bank reported a loss of 484 million francs before taxes, beating analysts expectations.In the first three months of the year, we have remained focused on executing our strategy with three clear priorities: accelerating our cost and head count reduction efforts, delivering profitable growth in wealth-management-focused divisions and maintaining our strong capital position, Mr. Thiam said in a news release. We have been able to make good progress in all of these areas against an extremely challenging market backdrop.Revenue declined 30 percent, to 4.64 billion francs, in the first quarter, from 6.65 billion francs in the same period a year earlier.The banks global markets and investment banking businesses both showed pretax losses in the quarter, as the lender navigated some of the most difficult markets on record and trading volumes and client activity were drastically reduced, Mr. Thiam said.While we saw tentative signs of a pickup in activity in March and then in April, subdued market conditions and low levels of client activity are likely to persist in the second quarter of 2016 and possibly beyond, he said.The global markets business reported a pretax loss of 635 million francs in the first quarter, compared with a pretax profit of 842 million francs in the same period a year earlier.The investment banking and capital markets business reported a pretax loss of 103 million francs in the quarter, from a pretax loss of 47 million francs in the first quarter of 2015.As part of its reshaping, Credit Suisse is trying to reduce the companys annual net costs by 1.4 billion francs this year. It achieved more than half of those cuts during the quarter, Mr. Thiam said. The bank is aiming for overall cost cuts of 4.3 billion Swiss francs by the end of 2018.The bank has already made about 3,500 of 6,000 expected job cuts this year, Mr. Thiam said. The bank employed 47,760 people at the end of the first quarter.Over all, operating expenses declined 3 percent, to 4.97 billion francs, in the quarter, from 5.11 billion francs in the first quarter of 2015. Credit Suisse also took restructuring charges of 255 million francs in the first quarter.Despite the challenging environment, Mr. Thiam said that the companys businesses focused on wealth management performed strongly in the quarter.The banks international wealth management business reported a pretax profit of 270 million francs in the quarter, compared with 263 million francs in the first quarter of 2015.Credit Suisses Asia-Pacific business reported a pretax profit of 251 million francs in the first quarter, from 465 million francs in the same period a year earlier.Its so-called universal bank in Switzerland reported a pretax profit of 426 million francs in the quarter, compared with 427 million francs in the first quarter of 2015.Separately, Credit Suisse said on that it had named Eric Varvel as global head of its asset management within its international wealth management business beginning on June 1.He will report to Iqbal Kahn, the chief executive of international wealth management and will replace Robert Jain, who is expected to leave Credit Suisse later this year.Mr. Varvel has more than 25 years experience at Credit Suisse, previously serving as chief executive of its investment bank and a member of the banks executive boardHe stepped down from the executive board in October 2014 as part of a shake-up of the investment bank and took on the role of chairman for the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East regions."}
{"text": "The recent rash of drug violations in baseball continued Tuesday, but with a twist.Raul A. Mondesi, an infielder who is on the Kansas City Royals 40-man roster at Class AA Northwest Arkansas, received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for Clenbuterol, a performance-enhancing drug.The suspension, however, was reduced from the 80 games that are mandated for first-time offenses by an arbitration panel. Mondesi supplied evidence that it came from an over-the-counter cold medicine in the Dominican Republic. The panel also ruled that Mondesi can be eligible for postseason play.Last year, Mondesi, the son of the former outfielder Raul Mondesi, became the first player to make his major league debut in the World Series. He struck out as a pinch-hitter in Game 3 against the Mets. It was his only appearance.Mondesi is the fifth player suspended for performance-enhancing drugs this season. He joins Miamis Dee Gordon, Torontos Chris Colabello, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Josh Ravin and Philadelphia pitcher Daniel Stumpf. Gordon tested positive for exogenous testosterone and clostebol; Colabello and Stump for dehydrochlormethyltestosterone; and Ravin for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 2.Mondesi said in a statement that he took the medication Subrox-C to treat cold and flu symptoms, failing to read the label or consult with the team trainer. He did not know it contained a banned substance, Mondesi said in the statement. I tested positive for that banned substances, with a minuscule amount of Clenbuterol in my system, which could not have possibly enhanced my performance on the field.Royals Manager Ned Yost said the case underlined the importance of players checking with team trainers before they take any sort of medicine or supplement, even energy drinks.Its not that they ignore it, Yost said. I think subconsciously you go into a store and buy something for a cold. How much damage can that do? Well, you find out it can do a lot of damage. It can cost you 50 games.Clenbuteral, which can be used as a decongestant and aids asthma victims, also increases aerobic capacity. It gained notoriety as one of the substances distributed to dozens of players by the former Mets clubhouse assistant Kirk Radomski.According to the M.L.B. Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment program, the arbitration panel can reduce a suspension for first-time offenders to 40 games if the player proves by clear and convincing evidence that he bears no significant fault or negligence for the positive test. If the panel reduces a suspension, the player remains eligible for postseason play."}
{"text": "Q. Does the Touch ID sensor on the iPhone work with more than one fingerprint? If so, can the other fingerprint be from someone else, like a spouse?A. You can use up to five different fingerprints with the Touch ID sensor that comes with certain iPhone and iPad models, so one of those fingers could be from a spouse. Apples support site does warn, Each new print might make fingerprint recognition take slightly longer, and keep in mind that certain circumstances require the numeric passcode instead of Touch ID to unlock the device.Opening the Touch ID & Passcode controls in the iOS Settings is one of those situations where you do need to enter the four- or six-digit numeric passcode for the device. Once you tap in the number to unlock the Touch ID & Passcode settings, scroll down to the Fingerprints section and tap the Add a Fingerprint option.The next few screens guide you through placing the new finger on the Touch ID sensor in several ways so the fingerprint information is collected and stored on the phone. By default, the fingerprints will be listed as Finger 1, Finger 2 and so on in the settings, but you can name them something more helpful by tapping an entry and typing in a new name on the next screen. (You can also delete a fingerprint here if needed.)If you have not renamed the fingers yet, you can see which one is listed under what name by placing a finger on the Touch ID sensor; iOS highlights the name in the list that matches the digit. Press the Home button to close the iOS Settings app when you are finished adding and editing fingers.Make sure your spouse also knows the iPhones passcode. Those numbers are needed after the device restarts, if a fingerprint is not recognized after five tries, or if the phone has not been unlocked in 48 hours."}
{"text": "This piece, inspired by The Timess Room for Debate feature, was written by three members of our spring Student Council.Students might read the arguments and answer some of the discussion questions, and then, using the piece as a model and the related resources for additional ideas, create their own Room for Debate-style projects on issues that concern them.What Aspect of the Criminal Justice System Should We Fix First?There has been consensus among many that the United Statess criminal justice system  from the police force to the legal system to the prison system  is broken. However, overarching, significant reform of will take time and stretch limited resources. What aspect of criminal justice reform should the United States pursue first?Below, three students from across the country take different perspectives on that question. What do you think?A Trigger-Happy Task Force\nPhotoHenry Xu is a high-school senior from San Diego, Calif.To say law enforcement is a difficult job would undoubtedly be an understatement. Unexpected, sometimes life-threatening, encounters with dangerous individuals are the foundation of a career whose primary purpose is to serve and protect the public. As a result, the police are currently given considerable leeway in their judgment of response to potential threats. To quote the movie Anchorman, its a system that 60 percent of the time, it works every time. Which means, in other words, that it frequently fails to deliver on its promise to the American people.In 2001, police use of force was defined by the The International Association of Chiefs of Police as the amount of effort required by police to compel compliance by an unwilling subject. Its an amount of effort that has grown alarmingly lethal in recent years, and increased media coverage of incidents in cities like Cleveland, Baltimore and Chicago has sent waves through the nation.To make matters worse, these explosive confrontations occur unequally across all demographics, with questions of racial bias coloring most cases of force. The Washington Post found that from January to July of 2015, unarmed black men were seven times more likely to die from police gunfire than their white counterparts.Changes have been proposed by numerous parties, and in some states, city police departments have already taken steps to curtail the use of excessive force. In 2014, a Federal District Court threw out a challenge filed by Seattle police officers to new guidelines on force that had been adopted after a Justice Department investigation. Other proposed changes, such as the adoption of a necessity rule, which would mandate lethal force only as a last resort, have seen considerable support from some states, while facing fierce opposition by others.While a shift in regulations is necessary to reform police use of force, the maintenance of the status quo is heavily assisted by a general lack of accountability for situations where force is improperly used. Fortunately, improvements are slowly being made. The Inspector General of the New York Police Department, in a report on the use of force in the city last year, noted that while the department historically, has frequently failed to discipline officers who use force without justification, discipline rates for those confirmed to have used excessive force have increased in recent years.Reform is happening  but not fast enough. With murky protocol for situations requiring use of force, an ineffective method of imposing disciplinary action for officers who overstep their bounds, and an apparent racial bias that plagues its officers every step of the way, law enforcement should be the primary center of attention. There is no doubt that our criminal justice system is broken. But if we cant get the accused abusers to the courts in the first place, there will be no justice system to fix at all.Lets Fix the Legal System  Now\nPhotoSabrina Conte is a high school senior from Glen Ridge, N.J.The principles of equality, fairness and justice have always been part of our national identity. Our legal system  the matrix of laws and courts that create and review decisions on right and wrong with the ultimate goal of protecting the rights of American citizens  is perhaps the most important tool with which to defend these principles.However, our biggest obstacle in this defense might just be the institution itself. The legal part of the criminal justice system is plagued with faults that reduce its ability to fulfill its obligations to the American people, doing them major harm in the process.One fault lies in one of the most fundamental aspects of the system: the evidence. Certain types of evidence we take as ironclad proof of guilt are far less accurate than they seem. Bite-mark matching was discredited by the National Academy of Sciences. The F.B.I. recently admitted that nearly every examiner in an elite F.B.I. forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000. And unassailable proof of guilt like eyewitness testimony, confessions or forensic evidence can be inaccurate because of the unreliability of memory, police coercion, or the implicit biases of presiding forensic examiners.These inconsistencies have consequences. One of the easiest to see is wrongful conviction, which leaves people languishing for years in prison because of a justice system that fails to protect them. Consider Hector Ayala, an inmate who is sitting on death row because of race-based jury selection (illegal under Supreme Court ruling), and who the courts have refused to retry or release. Read the story of Sandeep Bharadia, who was convicted to life without parole. When newfound DNA evidence seemed to prove his innocence, he was refused another trial because of mistakes made by his lawyer.These cases are just the beginning. There is potential for mistreatment in every level of the system. There are judges who refuse to recuse themselves from cases where there are clear conflicts of interest, and there are abusive prosecutors who purposefully withhold evidence establishing a defendants innocence. The overfilled court systems of urban areas make cases drag on for years, becoming an expensive and emotion-filled burden for victims.And to make things worse, our legal system inflicts major harm on those who can least afford it: minorities and the poor. The Justice Department ruled that St. Louis county in Missouri was biased against black juveniles, saying that judges made no real effort to determine whether pleas were coerced, whether defendants had any criminal intent, or whether they understood the full consequences of admitting guilt. The bail system holds people in jail based on whether they can afford to pay, disproportionately affecting the poor by forcing them to forego paychecks and subjecting them to dangerous prison conditions. Understaffed and underfunded public defenders offices have started turning defendants away, leaving those who cannot pay for a private lawyer with few options.Our current legal system is unjust. It allows systematic violations of ethics, accepts flawed or uncertain evidence as proof of crime and targets those who most need defending. It needs to be revamped immediately  or it will continue to threaten the intrinsic freedoms of American citizens.A Failed System of Punishment  Americas Mass-Incarceration Problem\nPhotoGrace Masback is a high school junior from Portland, Ore.As a white woman in the United States, my odds of being sent to prison are 1 in 111. For my younger brother, a white male, the odds are 1 in 17. But for my male African-American friend, the odds have been reported to be 1 in 3.The United Statess criminal justice system is broken, and the way our nation manages crime and criminals is inefficient and ineffective. The systems greatest shortcomings have been policies of punitive, not rehabilitative, punishment, which have resulted in mass-incarceration, incredible expenses, and soaring recidivism rates.The United States holds the worlds highest rate of incarceration, about 750 people per 100,000. This rate surpasses those in Rwanda, Russia, China and North Korea. Although Americans make up just under 5 percent of the worlds population, the countrys prisons hold 22 percent of the worlds prisoners.While there is nothing inherently wrong with using prison to punish and separate dangerous individuals from society, Americas system is so overwhelmed it has forgone the possibility of redemption, handing down long sentences instead of looking for ways to reintegrate criminals into their communities. The average burglar in the United States receives a sentence of 16 months, while the same crime receives a five-month sentence in Canada.Prisoners need education, skills and job training to help break cycles of poverty that put many of them behind bars in the first place. Educating prisoners saves the public almost $5 for every $1 spent on prison education, but the commitment to educational initiatives is inadequate and in decline. While 70 percent of prisons had education programs in the early 90s, only 4 percent had them in 2004. Only 141 inmates earned degrees in 2011. The lack of focus on education and rehabilitation leads to rising recidivism rates, with 68 percent of released inmates returning to prison. This costs billions in taxpayer dollars as the United States spends $31,000 per inmate each year, or around $40 billion annually on its prisons.Ultimately, the system puts entire communities in a state of perpetual hardship. By age 18, one in four African-American children will have had a parent incarcerated. For the 70 million Americans with criminal records, its harder to get an apartment, job, government assistance or to even vote. Such a system builds resentment and mistrust and creates a cycle of poverty.America was founded as a nation of liberty and opportunity. As a young person, I dont want to inherit a country characterized by barbed wire and the abject abandonment of broad swaths of society. Before dealing with other broken aspects of the criminal justice system, we must address the root causes of soaring incarceration rates, embracing restorative and rehabilitative justice. Trust between the police and communities can be rebuilt by ensuring that young people are no longer imprisoned en masse for interminable sentences. We must move aggressively toward a system that identifies value in all individuals, no matter their actions.Questions for Writing or Discussion:Going Further:Additional Resources1.

{"text": "It was the buzz at the door Brian Andrew Whiteley had been dreading for months.On Monday afternoon, a pair of police officers in plain clothes and a Secret Service agent appeared at his Brooklyn apartment. Mr. Whiteley, an artist, was nervous but not exactly surprised.On March 27, Easter Sunday, he had secretly dropped off his latest project in Central Park: a gravestone bearing the name of Donald J. Trump. The epitaph read Made America Hate Again. The stone was quickly removed by the parks department and confiscated by the police.Since then, mystery remained about the identity of the person responsible, although Mr. Whiteley, 33, had previously spoken to reporters anonymously, for fear of arrest. But after that Monday visit, his name surfaced in The New York Times. His cover blown, he came forward.It was superintimidating, he said in a telephone interview on Monday evening, after his nearly hourlong interrogation. But the project was 100 percent worth it.Mr. Whiteley is no stranger to discomfiting and absurd work; he has masqueraded as Bigfoot, staged a piece involving a naked man on a crucifix surrounded by balloons, and marched through Green-Wood Cemetery  dressed as a clown. But this experience may have changed him.Ive been literally terrified for about a month, he said. Its been like nightmare land, it really has, to pull this off. The arrival of the authorities was, in some way, a relief. I dont plan on stopping my guerrilla-style projects, he said, but I do know my limits.Asked about the incident, a Secret Service spokesman said late Tuesday, The Secret Service is aware of this matter and is conducting the appropriate follow-up investigation. Mr. Whiteley was not charged with a crime. The Trump campaign has also not commented.In a telephone conversation shortly after the gravestones discovery, Mr. Whiteley said he was not calling for the death of Donald. He continued, Im making an artistic statement, suggesting that Mr. Trump should rethink his legacy.This especially polarizing election cycle has needled activists and artists alike; Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz have all been turned into street art. But Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has provoked an exceptionally vigorous creative response, with sometimes profane imagery popping up around the world.I would call them somewhat stunts rather than artwork, said Tom Eccles, a curator with a background in public art. Its an opportunistic moment.Still, Mr. Eccles, executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, described the reaction by authorities to Mr. Whiteleys project (which he called a little silly) as overblown.If the artist was investigated in a way to send a message to others, that would be chilling, he said.He added that at a time when much public art in New York is essentially corporate in some form, it was refreshing to see an unfiltered take. Even if Im not particularly engaged by the artwork, I applaud the effort of the artists, he said.Some artists are following Mr. Trump on the road. Last fall, David Gleeson and Mary Mihelic, who work as the t.Rutt collective, bought Mr. Trumps old campaign bus and have been driving it around the country, stopping at rallies. They replaced his slogan Make America Great Again with Make Fruit Punch Great Again on their vehicle, and have encouraged people to pelt it with juice, in the hopes that it would help process the emotion that was clearly getting ready to be stirred up in this campaign, Mr. Gleeson said.Both Trump fans and opponents have been angered  They dont understand why this bus is art, Ms. Mihelic said  but the artists have also had positive conversations. Were very hopeful that art in this kind of absurd environment is useful, Mr. Gleeson said.Creating the gravestone was not the first time Mr. Whiteley had taken on Mr. Trump in his work. In February, he even dressed up as Mr. Trump and, in the WhiteBox gallery, staged a routine with another artist, Rebecca Goyette, dressed as Sarah Palin  a performance that his interrogators this week were aware of, he said.They also asked him about what books he was reading, whether he owned a gun and whether he attended presidential rallies. Luckily, I think I passed all the marks that they needed to see, Mr. Whiteley said. I did not fit the profile of an assassin.Christopher Stout, who shows Mr. Whiteleys pieces in his gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn, said he was absolutely unsurprised when Mr. Whiteley described the gravestone idea to him last year. (The project was financed by an independent collector.)It thoroughly fits the canon of his work, Mr. Stout said. Nonetheless, Mr. Stout advised Mr. Whiteley, a founder of the Satellite art fair, an alternative to Art Basel in Miami Beach, to consult a lawyer. (The artist has since engaged the civil rights lawyer Ronald L. Kuby.)Mr. Whiteley said that, in using a gravestone, he wanted to send an unmissable message to Mr. Trump. I thought the only thing that could affect someone who builds buildings and talks real loud and is the bully on the playground is to remind him of his own mortality, he said.After the police seized the gravestone, Mr. Whiteley said he contacted the fabricators, a family-owned memorial company in Brooklyn, to see if it would make a second edition. The company declined. Now he hopes to get the original back and exhibit it in New York or Washington.At the moment, he said, it is not for sale."}
{"text": "When Jimmy Kimmel asked Hillary Clinton in a  late-night TV interview about U.F.O.s, she quickly corrected his terminology.You know, theres a new name, Mrs. Clinton said in the March appearance. Its unexplained aerial phenomenon, she said. U.A.P. Thats the latest nomenclature.Known for her grasp of policy, Mrs. Clinton has spoken at length in her presidential campaign on topics as diverse as Alzheimers research and military tensions in the South China Sea. But it is her unusual knowledge about extraterrestrials that has struck a small but committed cohort of voters.Mrs. Clinton has vowed that barring any threats to national security, she would open up government files on the subject, a shift from President Obama, who typically dismisses the topic as a joke. Her position has elated U.F.O. enthusiasts, who have declared Mrs. Clinton the first E.T. candidate.Hillary has embraced this issue with an absolutely unprecedented level of interest in American politics, said  Joseph G. Buchman, who has spent decades calling for government transparency about extraterrestrials.Mrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who often bemoans being the subject of Republican conspiracy theories, has shown surprising ease plunging into the discussion of the possibility of extraterrestrial beings.She has said in recent interviews that as president she would release information about Area 51, the remote Air Force base in Nevada believed by some to be a secret hub where the government stores classified information about aliens and U.F.O.s.In a radio interview last month, she said, I want to open the files as much as we can. Asked if she believed in U.F.O.s, Mrs. Clinton said: I dont know. I want to see what the information shows. But she added, Theres enough stories out there that I dont think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen making them up.When asked about extraterrestrials in an interview with The Conway Daily Sun in New Hampshire last year, Mrs. Clinton promised to get to the bottom of it.I think we may have been visited already, she said in the interview. We dont know for sure.While Americans typically point to issues like the economy and terrorism as top priorities for the next president, a desire for answers about aliens has inspired a passionate bloc of voters, who make their voices heard on social media.Stephen Bassett, who lobbies the government on extraterrestrial issues, views a Clinton presidency as a chance to finally get the United States to disclose all it knows about life beyond Earth. Since November 2014, Mr. Bassetts organization has sent roughly 2.5 million Twitter messages to presidential candidates, elected officials and the news media urging a serious discussion of the issue.That was a storm, and now its like a steady drip, Mr. Bassett said.The movement viewed Mrs. Clintons decision to correct Mr. Kimmels use of the term U.F.O., which some view as loaded and rooted more in science fiction than in science, as a breakthrough because it suggested shed been briefed by someone and is not just being flippant, Mr. Buchman said.In fact, Mrs. Clinton had been briefed. She was prepped by her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, who is not only a well-respected Washington hand, having served as a top adviser to Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton, but also a  crusader for the disclosure of government information on unexplained phenomena that could prove the existence of intelligent life outside Earth.The time to pull back the curtain on the topic is long overdue, Mr. Podesta wrote in his foreword for the 2010 book UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go on the Record, by Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist.Mrs. Clintons position is not a political response to public sentiment  63 percent of Americans do not believe in U.F.O.s, according to an Associated Press poll. But it reflects the decades of overlap between the rise to power of Bill and Hillary Clinton and popular cultures obsession with the universes most mysterious questions.In 1996, Mrs. Clinton was ridiculed after Bob Woodward reported, in his book The Choice, that as first lady she had held discussions with her deceased role models, Eleanor Roosevelt and Mohandas K. Gandhi. The tabloid Weekly World News dreamed up sensational headlines about Mrs. Clintons adopting an alien baby and having a U.F.O. love nest.The Clinton presidency also coincided with the hit television series The X-Files and movies like Independence Day, which gave way to an era of fascination with the existence of aliens and the possibility of a government cover-up.Mr. Podesta, an X-Files fanatic, ran a fan club for the show in the Clinton White House. The X-Files fan club would like to invite you and Mulder to lunch at the White House. Dont let the boss know, he wrote in a 1998 email, referring to the shows fictional F.B.I. agent Fox Mulder, according to White House documents. In 1999, Mr. Podesta had an X-Files-themed 50th birthday party that the Clintons attended.When Mr. Podesta left the White House last year, he posted on Twitter: Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the U.F.O. files. #thetruthisstilloutthere.Mr. Podesta declined to comment for this article.Mrs. Clinton, who speaks frequently about her childhood aspirations to be a NASA astronaut, has been sympathetic to Mr. Podestas efforts.In 1995, when she was photographed visiting Laurance S. Rockefeller, a billionaire philanthropist, in Jackson Hole, Wyo., she had tucked under her arm a copy of Are We Alone?: Philosophical Implications of the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life, by Paul Davies.Before that meeting, John H. Gibbons, the former director of the White House Offices of Science and Technology Policy, had warned Mrs. Clinton about Mr. Rockefeller, who had spent years pressuring the government to release files relating to a 1947 crash near Roswell, N.M., that had become the source of theories about a cover-up of an alien spaceship.He will want to talk to you about his interest in extrasensory perception, paranormal phenomena and U.F.O.s, Mr. Gibbons wrote.The meeting enthralled conspiracy theorists and, in turn, inspired Hollywood writers.If you look at our mythology, there are elements of those kinds of meetings, Chris Carter, the creator and executive producer of The X-Files, said in an interview. Mr. Carter, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, added, If I have to become a fund-raiser to get an invite to her opening up the files, Ill do it.When Mrs. Clinton started to talk openly about U.F.O.s and government disclosure in her 2016 campaign, some activists traced the remarks back to the 1995 meeting with Mr. Rockefeller.To this subset of Americans who say the government is covering up what it knows about aliens, and who are incredibly vocal on social media, Mrs. Clintons discussion of extraterrestrials signaled an important turn.Other activists do not care as much about Mrs. Clintons vow to open the files, but do want prominent politicians to seriously acknowledge that humans may not be the only intelligent life in the universe. A major victory, some say, would be for the candidates to be asked about the topic in a presidential debate.It shouldnt be a source of embarrassment to discuss it, said Christopher Mellon, a former intelligence official at the Defense Department and the Senate Intelligence Committee. We should be humble in terms of recognizing the extreme limits of our own understanding of physics and the universe."}

{"text": "FIFA on Tuesday began laying the groundwork for the 2026 World Cup, announcing a bidding process in which it would decide on a possible expansion of the field by this fall and select the host country for the event in May 2020.The process that was unveiled Tuesday at FIFAs congress in Mexico City will unfold in four phases. The first will be a so-called strategy and consultation period in which FIFA will consider a possible expansion of the World Cup field; a review of the organizations stance on joint bids by multiple countries; and the introduction of human rights and environmental and sustainability requirements for bidders.FIFA said it would resolve those questions by May 2017, but said in a statement that the decision on the number of teams, formats and, intriguingly, the eligibility of confederations to bid was expected by October.The United States, which hosted the World Cup in 1994, is expected to eagerly bid for the 2026 tournament. Under FIFAs current continental rotation system, the 2026 host most likely would come from Concacaf, the region encompassing North and Central America and the Caribbean. In addition to the United States, Mexico and Canada have also said they plan to bid.England has also expressed interest in hosting another World Cup, and Australia and New Zealand have discussed a joint bid. But with Russia (Europe) and Qatar (Asia) hosting the next two tournaments, FIFA would need to abandon its rotation system for either to be eligible. Under that system, confederations are barred from hosting if they have hosted either of the previous two World Cups.After the strategy questions are put to rest this year, the more formal bidding process will take place in the second phase, from June 2017 to December 2018. FIFA will use the year after that to evaluate the bids, through February 2020. The vote for the host will take place in May 2020.FIFA last picked a World Cup host in 2010, when it chose Russia (2018) and Qatar (2022) on the same day. That vote has come to be seen as rife with corruption and vote-trading, and it has since taken a toll on FIFAs reputation and leadership.FIFA elected a new president, Gianni Infantino, in February to replace its longtime chief, Sepp Blatter. Infantino has suggested several possible changes to the World Cup, including expanding it to 40 teams from 32 to allow more countries to take part. Infantino has also expressed support for joint bids, which have become common for the European championships, but some in FIFA have frowned on the idea because of the inherent security, logistics and visa issues involved in a tournament spanning international borders."}
{"text": "American Ballet Theater, the only dance company to appear at the Metropolitan Opera House these days, is taking admirable box-office risks this spring, the kind that come from core beliefs. Traditionally, the companys seasons at the huge Met, impelled by the need to be popular, have relied overmuch on guest stars and full-length war horses that are mostly from the 19th century and too often artistically thin. But the eight-week season that the troupe opened on Monday with Frederick Ashtons three-act Sylvia is the most enterprising it has offered in decades. It brings new hope to Lincoln Center and to ballet. It also shows Ballet Theater as a true company.Two weeks of this May through July 2016 season belong to 21st-century ballets, six of them one-acts by Alexei Ratmansky (with a world premiere to music by Leonard Bernstein). Two other weeks consist of full-length mid-20th-century ballets by the British master Ashton. In a fifth week, the company revives Mr. Ratmanskys 2015 production of The Sleeping Beauty, with 1890 choreography by Marius Petipa, under Mr. Ratmanskys painstaking supervision.Though this Ashton-Ratmansky emphasis has never before been so pronounced, its not new. Mr. Ratmansky became artist in residence at Ballet Theater in 2009, while Ashton ballets in recent years have often proved the most perfectly realized examples of poetic theater in any Ballet Theater season. And together, the Ashton and Ratmansky ballets propose an emphasis on human intimacy, lively characterization, detailed musicality and rich harmony among dance, music and visual design.These virtues shine forth in Sylvia (1952). If you chose, you could take potshots galore at this ballet. The story ought to be weak: When the heroine is abducted, its not the hero who saves her but the god of love. The characters should be ludicrous. There are even a pair of dancing goats.But what never fails are the crucial things: the multicolored beauty of Lo Delibess 1876 score, the vigor with which the dancers throw themselves into making the story three-dimensional, and the detailed grace with which the choreography and dancers make the music matter. The plot turns out to be amazingly suspenseful. Just as you think youve reached a happy ending in the final acts grand pas de deux for the huntress Sylvia and her love, Aminta, the couples happiness is seriously threatened by Diana, goddess of the moon, of hunting and of chastity.Sylvia, though the plot is set in antiquity, is a multifaceted, modern character. Shes chaste, devoted to Diana and indifferent to Aminta until Eros, god of love, wounds her with one of his arrows. After that, love transforms her, but she proves resourceful and witty. When Orion, another hunter, abducts her to his island, she plies him with wine and fools him with seemingly seductive dances until he falls asleep. Shes a virtuoso (this is the most brilliant role ever choreographed by Ashton for Margot Fonteyn) who grows only more brilliant.Beautifully, Ashtons choreography shows not just how Sylvia is transformed but also how she remains the same. Before love strikes, shes marmoreal, regal, darting, proud, and those virtues stay splendid in her, from head to foot, when love is victorious. She has a characteristic arabesque, in which one leg stretches straight behind her, not high but firm, while her torso arches, and her arms echo the legs line. That position is ideal for her chastity, and yet its also perfect for her when shes at one with Aminta. The difference is in transition. In one of the crowning moments of the pas de deux, she holds that arabesque, leaning against Amintas chest, while he frames her head in his hands, and she sensuously sweeps her arms past his hands, down and apart like opening wings.When shes wounded, her legs vibrate and stutter, but she stays on point, and the rapid progress of her toes and torso toward Aminta has an extraordinary effect, as if she couldnt control her desire. That vibrancy returns in the final act, when she dances the great pizzicato solo. Here, her points hop, bounce, rebound  but now her posture is jubilant, her rhythm ebullient.Aminta, likewise, is wonderfully diverse: hero and dreamboat, shepherd and lover. He turns both right and left, arrives from multiple pirouettes in surprising, forward-leaning positions and vaults high, only to pivot in midair. He combines vulnerability and strength, power and lyricism.And Delibess score, a marvel of melodic variety, makes theatrical magic from instrumental colors. When Sylvia and her attendants arrive in Act III, they disembark from Eross boat to a barcarole led by the suavely surprising sound of a saxophone (highly unusual in 19th-century orchestration); when Aminta carries Sylvia, arched and aloft, onto the stage, its to a solo violin, singing sweet and high.The illustrious Gillian Murphy, as Sylvia, has few roles that better show her bravura skills. But Ive known her to dance Acts II and III with more musical playfulness in the past, and her eyes show that shes less at ease with her audience, though vividly responsive with her partner, Marcelo Gomes. Mr. Gomes seems at ease with the world. A model of style, a tower of strength, hes the artist who most winningly embodies the virtues of American Ballet Theater at its most terrific.Other lead couples, all notable, follow as this week progresses: Hee Seo with Roberto Bolle (Saturday afternoon); Isabella Boylston and Xander Parish (Wednesday afternoon and Saturday evening); and Maria Kochetkova with Blaine Hoven (Wednesday evening) and Herman Cornejo (Friday evening). Mr. Parishs story is especially impressive: Hes an Englishman who left junior roles in the Royal Ballet to join the Mariinsky troupe in St. Petersburg, where he has danced Aminta and other principal roles. This will be his Ballet Theater debut. The season promises many further revelations."}
{"text": "The best scene in Wednesday nights episode of The Americans on FX was a moving evocation of late-stage Cold War insecurity, as both Americans and Soviets soberly contemplated the reality of an all-out nuclear exchange. But even more powerful was its depiction of the real golden age of television  when more than 100 million people would sit down at the same time on a Sunday night to watch a really scary and depressing TV movie.The film was The Day After (also the title of Wednesdays episode), shown on Nov. 20, 1983. One after another, the shows major characters  the Jenningses and Beemans (together, with Paige Jennings and Matthew Beeman giving each other the eye); William; Oleg and Tatiana (in bed!); Arkady; even Young-hee and Don  were seen bathed in the light of their TV sets, all tuned to the Washington ABC affiliate, WJLA Channel 7. Claudia and Gabriel apparently had better things to do.The scene came midway through a quiet, melancholy episode. Philip and Elizabeth were energized by their vacation  Stan, thrashed by Philip in racquetball, asked, You been taking vitamins or something? But the walls continued to close in on them and their colleagues, if only psychologically.William told Philip that the deadliest pathogen yet, a modified Lassa virus, was now being stored on the fourth floor of his lab, but he questioned whether they should even report its existence to their superiors. When Philip asked if he trusted the Americans to be the viruss only custodians, William replied, The threads on their containers work most of the time. In a similar but much more serious reference to Soviet incompetence, Oleg told Tatiana about the then-secret incident in September 1983 when a false alarm nearly led to the Soviet Unions launching its missiles against the United States. (It would have kept The Day After from getting on the air, but no one would have been around to appreciate the irony.)Paige, excited to be getting driving lessons from her dad, was still burdened by her new role as junior spy reporting on her pastor. Shes good at it, though  when she mentioned a church meeting and Philip said, You should go to that, she replied, We should all go to that. Pastor Tim likes to see them all together. At the meeting, Pastor Tim took Philip aside and told him that Paige seemed sad. He suggested that Philip, Elizabeth and Paige sit down with him to reassess the whole I-know-youre-spies thing. Just when he seemed safe, the pastor wants to put himself back in danger.Elizabeth wasnt at the meeting because one of the pieces of actual espionage shes still engaged in  using Don to get access to the fourth floor of Williams lab  was suddenly on the front burner because of the Lassa virus. You could argue that the way the writers gave Elizabeth her own Martha situation, right after the actual Martha situation, was a little on the nose  Id argue that, actually  but it was well handled all the same. Elizabeth had been enjoying her cultivation of Young-hee, finding in her a genuine friend, but when duty called, she answered as always.A search of the couples house, executed while she was babysitting their sleeping children, yielded nothing that could be used for blackmail (besides a lone VHS porn tape hidden behind Rocky and Sophies Choice). Direct action was called for. Several ruses later, Elizabeth had straight-arrow Don drugged and naked in bed at a safe house. He had resisted valiantly, and when he woke up and found himself with an equally naked Elizabeth, he actually apologized before running off.The scenes of Dons entrapment were cut with scenes of Paiges second driving lesson, when Philip handed her the keys to his Camaro  the joyful American coming-of-age ritual entwined with the sort of work that could lie in Paiges future. They came face to face when Elizabeth arrived home, greeted by an excited Paige, and turned away, claiming a headache. Philip patted the disappointed Paige on the head and went to Elizabeth, who told him, Im going to miss her. She was talking about Young-hee, though you couldnt help thinking that it also applied, in its way, to her still semi-innocent daughter.Random observation: If it werent for Fresh Off the Boat, would this have been the first time a character called a loved one yobo on American television?"}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont captured the West Virginia primary on Tuesday, forcing Hillary Clinton to continue a costly and distracting two-front battle: to lock down the Democratic nomination and to take on Donald J. Trump in the general election.Mrs. Clinton has a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates, which Mr. Sanderss victory, one week after he won Indiana, did little to narrow. But by staying in the race, as he has vowed to do until the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July, Mr. Sanders continues to tug Mrs. Clinton to the left.This week, after long resisting Mr. Sanderss call for a single-payer health care system, Mrs. Clinton embraced allowing people as young as 50 to buy into Medicare.In Oregon, which votes next week, Mr. Sanders appealed to unpledged superdelegates, who can cast votes as they please at the convention, to rally behind him as the stronger opponent to Mr. Trump.If you look over the last month or six weeks, at every national poll, Bernie Sanders defeats Donald Trump by big numbers, he said.With Mr. Trump aggressively attacking Mrs. Clinton as he focuses on the general election, Mrs. Clintons potential vulnerability was exposed in her defeats in West Virginia and Indiana, states with many white, working-class voters.Once a core Democratic constituency, whites in Appalachia without a college education have deserted the party over cultural issues like guns and President Obamas environmental policies, which have hurt the coal mining industry.Mrs. Clinton tried to repair relations in the last week, less because of her contest with Mr. Sanders than to mend fences for the November election.She campaigned hard along the Ohio River, knowing that she must stanch the defection of working-class voters, especially white men, to Mr. Trump in two crucial states, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Her campaign, which has not bought television ads since her sweep of four Eastern states on April 26 and hoped to conserve money for the general election, is going back on the air in Kentucky before its primary next week.Mrs. Clintons vulnerability in Ohio and Pennsylvania was highlighted by polls released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University, which showed her running close with Mr. Trump in the two states but losing ground because of a wide gender gap. In Ohio, which has voted with the winning candidate in the last 10 presidential elections, she was ahead of Mr. Trump by seven percentage points among women, but behind by 15 points among men.In Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump aims to win as part of a Rust Belt strategy, Mrs. Clinton was ahead among women by 19 points, but losing to Mr. Trump among men by an equal 19 points.Mr. Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee last week with a landslide victory in Indiana, added icing to the cake on Tuesday by taking West Virginia and Nebraska. (Democrats voted in Nebraska on March 5.)Even before the withdrawal of his last Republican rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Mr. Trump was far and away the leader in West Virginia polls. At a rally in the state last week, he promised to bring back coal mining jobs, without giving any details.The decline of coal in Appalachia is a result of increased mechanization of mining, the conversion of power plants to cheaper natural gas, and environmental regulations. The industry and its political allies play down the first two and blame the White House for a war on coal.Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax, opposes Mr. Obamas plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both propose more rapid transitions to cleaner energy, partly to create new jobs.Mrs. Clinton was haunted throughout her visits to West Virginia and Kentucky last week by a comment she made in March that her climate change policies would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. She made the remark in the context of pledging money to coal communities, but the sound bite trailed her, and she found herself repeatedly on the defensive.Mr. Sanderss victory was less about policy differences with Mrs. Clinton (his environmental plans would phase out coal more rapidly) than about the states demographics. He beat Mrs. Clinton in a largely white, rural state, as he has throughout the primaries.Eight years ago, when Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Obama in West Virginias primary, one in five voters said in exit polls that race had been a factor."}
{"text": "Minerality, one of wines most hotly contested words, is often assailed as imprecise and too general, even as it is widely used among wine professionals. I find it far more useful than bothersome.Here in Wine School, we try to talk about wine clearly and meaningfully. The use of this term, which came up repeatedly in our recent discussion about Austrian riesling (partly because of my prompting), may seem to run counter to our bias against jargon. Yet it is practical in describing a wines salient characteristics without descending into the sort of hyper-specific terminology that often ends up reducing the essence of a wine to a grocery list.We hope not to get too bogged down in the minutiae of tasting descriptions. In an effort to explore the varieties of wine-drinking experiences with an eye toward better understanding our own tastes, we aim to drink as many different sorts of wines as we can. We evaluate our reactions, both rational and emotional. This includes articulating not only how a wine smelled and tasted, but also how it made us feel and how it acted with food.As we do each month, I recommend three examples of a particular wine, and you drink it in a relaxed setting, with a meal. If you are so inclined, I ask you to share your thoughts and insights about the wines by commenting at nytimes.com/food.The three Austrian rieslings I suggested, all from the 2014 vintage, were Knoll Wachau Loibner Federspiel, Alzinger Wachau Drnsteiner Federspiel and Brndlmayer Kamptal Terrassen.Just to decipher a bit, the Knoll and the Alzinger rieslings come from the Wachau region, along the Danube River west of Vienna. The Brndlmayer comes from the Kamptal, a little to the northeast of the Wachau. Loibner and Drnsteiner both refer to the geographical location of the vineyards  Loiben and Drnstein are neighboring villages. Terrassen generally suggests that the grapes came from terraced vineyards. Federspiel, a term used only for wines from the Wachau region, indicates they are medium-bodied, not as light as steinfeder but not as rich as smaragd, also terms used only in the Wachau.While I thought all of these wines were really good, they gave just a hint of how good Austrian rieslings can be. Tasting the best Austrian rieslings, which can combine a delicious richness with a coiled, tensile strength, would have required spending far more per bottle. Perhaps these bottles will inspire further experimentation.Each of the wines was lively and refreshing. The Brndlmayer was brisk and zesty with flavors of lime and apple. It was a bigger wine than the others, which is a little counterintuitive as wines from the Wachau are generally weightier than Austrian rieslings from other regions. But it seemed a little more straightforward.The Knoll also seemed full of verve and energy, with similar apple and lime flavors, but it was enhanced by a scent of warm rocks  minerality, that word again. The vivacious Alzinger stood out to me. It seemed more complex, with herbal, floral aromas and flavors, but it also had a savory, saline quality that I loved and a fine stoniness that threaded through from sip to swallow and beyond.One objection to the use of the term comes from people who take it literally, as if minerality were referring to actual minerals tasted in the wine. But clearly its metaphorical, used in the same way that people refer to tasting the flavors of cherry or blackberry. Another objection is that wine tasters ought to strive for more specific flavors and aromas. Ill get back to that idea.Most readers embraced these rieslings, and most found minerality to be a useful description. Several made an effort to discern what set apart the specific mineral qualities of these rieslings from mineral characteristics in other wines. Dan Barron of New York dug especially deeply, I thought.Imagine a soft, fresh sort of minerality, he wrote of the Brndlmayer, though he had the 2013 vintage, not the 14. Not steely at all. More fine-grained, powdery, in between chalky and seltzery, and veering into a curious yeasty quality.Powdery captured what I had in mind, particularly with the Alzinger. This quality contrasted, for example, with the wet-river-rocks sort of minerality that I often find in Mosel rieslings, the oceanic seashell quality of Chablis, the earthy, granitic character of cru Beaujolais.Would this level of detail be useful to others? Sean McCarthy of Wainscott, N.Y., for one, seemed to accept the notion of minerality without needing to explore it further. Does minerality have meaning for me: Is the Pope Catholic? he wrote. Its like licking a rock, and some of us like that.JKM of Washington, D.C., deserves special notice for finding time for Wine School and getting married this month (mazel tov!). The couple celebrated with a 2012 Loibner Burgstall Riesling Federspiel from the excellent Wachau producer F.X. Pichler, a wine he called downright kinetic. They also found time to meditate on minerality.For me, minerality exists as both flavor and texture, sometimes contributing a cool sleekness, or a saline/umami impression, or even a palpable tanginess/sharpness, he wrote. Its hard to describe, but its undeniable that certain wines offer additional flavors and sensations beyond fruit, acidity and tannins.Other readers also seemed to find the term useful. Many wine-tasting terms confuse me or make me skeptical, but not minerality, Ferguson wrote. The mix of herb and citrus tastes and the crisp texture of these wines are what I expect when I hear minerality. It also reminds one of the influence soil has on wine.Critics want more specific words: slate, for example, crushed igneous rocks, eggshells or petrichor, which refers to the pleasant aroma that comes with the first rain after a prolonged dry spell. No doubt, one can always be more specific in describing a wine. Ive found certain wines, especially those from volcanic soils, to have a bloody, iron character. And Ive often felt textural distinctions: pebbly, stony, papery and, yes, powdery.While all very specific terms indicate a wide vocabulary of sensory terms on the part of the taster, its not clear how much these terms communicate to the reader or the listener. The most specific terms serve best as mnemonic devices, jogging our memories to recall wines we have had in the past. More general terms, in my opinion, convey a better understanding of the character of a particular wine to a wider audience.Rather than speaking of wet slate, sedimentary stones or river rocks, its better to say simply the wine reminds me of animal, vegetable or, you know, that other word."}
{"text": "PARIS  Two former mayors from Rwanda went on trial in Paris on Tuesday for their suspected role in massacres of ethnic Tutsi in the early stages of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Tito Barahira, 64, the mayor of Kabarondo, a town nearly 50 miles east of the capital, Kigali, from 1977 to 1986, was a local Hutu party leader at the time of the genocide. Octavien Ngenzi, 58, was the towns mayor when about 800,000 people, most of them Tutsi, were killed around the country in just 100 days from April to July 1994. Both men have been charged with genocide and crimes against humanity.They are accused of orchestrating and taking part in the mass killing of Tutsi refugees and moderate Hutu who had sought shelter in a church in Kabarondo on April 13, 1994. Mr. Barahira is accused of organizing and leading a meeting that planned the massacres.In an interview with the France 24 news channel that was broadcast on Tuesday, Marie-Thrse Mukamwezi, a survivor of the massacre in Kabarondo, said Mr. Ngenzi had rounded up Tutsi with his car and gathered them at the church, where militias and Rwandan government forces began an attack.After the attack, the killers came with machetes, Ms. Mukamwezi said from Kabarondo. They killed almost all of the survivors. Tito Barahira was there with a spear. He was supervising the killings.The two men, who deny involvement in the massacre, face life in prison if convicted. They are being tried in France because the United Nations has granted countries around the world jurisdiction over crimes related to the 1994 genocide when the perpetrators are arrested on their national territory.Mr. Barahira was arrested in 2013 near the southwestern French city of Toulouse. Mr. Ngenzi was arrested in 2010 in Mayotte, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, where he had requested asylum using a fake identity. Both men have been in French custody since their arrests. They were sentenced in absentia to life in prison by Rwandan peoples courts, known as gacaca courts, in 2009.The court proceedings, scheduled to last nearly eight weeks, will be filmed for archival purposes, an unusual occurrence in France. The court session on Tuesday was largely procedural, with time devoted to jury selection and the presentation of witnesses. More than 100 are expected to testify, but their faces will not be filmed.The trial is the second to be brought in France against former Rwandan officials suspected of having roles in the genocide. France had long been criticized for not doing enough to prevent the genocide, and for providing weapons and military training to the Hutu-led government, which carried out the killings.In 2014, a French judge sentenced Pascal Simbikangwa, a former Rwandan intelligence officer, to 25 years in prison for complicity in the genocide and for crimes against humanity. Mr. Simbikangwa has appealed his sentence, and a new trial is expected to be held in October."}
{"text": "New York comes with a beat that certain people, like the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, can instantly follow. It welcomes you, he said in a recent interview at American Ballet Theaters studios on lower Broadway. You dont feel like an outsider.Since 2006, when he choreographed The Russian Seasons for New York City Ballet, Mr. Ratmansky, now 47, has been beguiling audiences in the city with dances that hint, loosely and not, at Russia  or rather his Russia, with its wealth of pageantry, theatricality and history. But there is an American sensibility in the mix as well. Why do his dances, even those with a Russian tone, feel so free, so American?George Balanchine, another St. Petersburg transplant, introduced a jazz sensibility to the classical form in dances like The Four Temperaments and Agon. What Mr. Ratmansky brings to ballet is a singular voice, unpredictable yet recognizable; he uses classical technique, but allows it to breathe in the joints  its loose, rangy, forthright.This season at Ballet Theater, where he has been the artist in residence since 2009, that mingling of the Russian and American spirit will be on display in heavy rotation with programming that includes his masterly Shostakovich Trilogy; Firebird, the Stravinsky vehicle that put Misty Copeland on the map; and Seven Sonatas, a subtle, luminous ballet set to Scarlatti.In June, he will present his take on Pushkins The Golden Cockerel, inspired by Michel Fokines 1914 Ballets Russes production. And the season closes with his staging of The Sleeping Beauty, which brings the spirit of Marius Petipas 1890 choreography to life.But first comes a new ballet to be unveiled at Ballet Theaters gala on Monday, May 16: an exploration of love set to and named after Leonard Bernsteins Serenade After Platos Symposium. For Mr. Ratmansky, creating a ballet to Bernstein  its not his first; he has choreographed two versions of The Dybbuk  is a chance to pair his choreography not only with an American composer but also one who is synonymous with New York City.I was looking for American music, he said. When I discovered it, I fell in love.The 1954 score, according to Bernsteins notes, is not a literal rendering of Platos text but rather a series of related statements in praise of love. As Mr. Ratmansky said, I dont believe that philosophy can be translated into dance; but its about love, which is very much part of our field for ballet.In Symposium, seven men, or speakers, ruminate on aspects of love; a woman, Diotima, about whom Socrates speaks, appears near the end of the ballet. Each of the men, the dancer Calvin Royal III said, has an individual voice. His, he explained, is more pensive and lyrical  very introspective. Its not in any way showy, but its expressive and definitely has something deeper and important to say. He added: I think its unlocked many things in me.And, as usual, it is physically taxing. Its a little too ambitious to only have eight dancers for a half an hour of big symphonic music, Mr. Ratmansky said. So I think theyre all going to die at once.He laughed and added: Which they always do in my ballets, Im afraid.At the time of this conversation, Mr. Ratmansky was half- finished with the dance. Its not his favorite place to be as a choreographer. I call it mid-process crisis, he said. I cant say more about it, because it hasnt taken shape yet.Developing his choreographic vision was a process itself. Born in St. Petersburg and raised in Ukraine, he trained at the school of the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. He performed with the National Ballet of Ukraine before moving to Canada to dance with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. It was there, under its artistic director, John Meehan, that he transformed as a dancer, performing works by George Balanchine, Frederick Ashton, Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp. He acquired speed and, he said, more turnout in the hips. He also learned how to push more from the floor for jumps.I did change quite fast I think, he said. It took a year, and then I was completely opposed to the Russian school, which was not right of course, but it was my reaction. And then I learned how to see balance: good things and less good things on both sides.Mr. Royal, who has worked extensively with Mr. Ratmansky over the years, described his style as composed of many elements. Expressive, dramatic, demanding, he said. Quick feet, a very lush port de bras. Hes always asking us to make his movements look more organic. To look more natural, but not necessarily at ease. Its organic in making it seamlessly fit with the music and the people youre dancing with onstage.Dancers in a Ratmansky piece form a society. There is an insistence that they must work together  performing with and for each other to immerse themselves into the perfume of each particular world. And its not only the dancers of Ballet Theater who get to live inside such realms this spring. New York City Ballet continues performances of his Concerto DSCH this month. And Miami City Ballet brought his Symphonic Dances, set to Rachmaninoff, to Lincoln Center in April.As he considers the season and the prospect of all of his ballets coming at once, Mr. Ratmansky is uneasy. Im scared, he said. But Ill survive.That fear comes, in part, because of the hours required to prepare his ballets for the stage. Its a lot of work, and it needs to be done precisely with a lot of details, he said. The commitment is there, but details, the polish. And also, he said: I worry about the sales  maybe the audience will say its too much of this guy.But the lineup demonstrates the versatility of what Mr. Ratmansky, who received his citizenship this year, has created while living in the United States. He said that he doesnt see himself as any more American now: I dont feel Ive changed much. Of course, my understanding of ballet is completely different from when I was at school. The loosening of the Iron Curtain, as he put it, changed much for Mr. Ratmansky. We started to get information, and that really made a big impact on me, he said. Even now, he added, I love Google Books.Mr. Ratmansky may make his home in America, but he has something that cant be taken away: a kind of Russian poetry, and a reverence for ballet history. His reconstructions of The Sleeping Beauty and, more recently, Swan Lake, performed in February by the Zurich Ballet, are just as important in advancing the classical form as his new productions. (Of all his reconstructions, he said, he has a soft spot for Swan Lake.)Mastering the Stepanov notation  a system of recording dance that dates to the turn of the 20th century  took time, but, he said, It opened the treasury room for me.He has inserted vintage steps into recent ballets; there will be some in his Bernstein premiere. When I run out of steps, that gives me steps, he said, laughing. But I know that Petipa did a lot of that, and I know Balanchine did a lot of that. I believe that all choreographers do that. Petipa presented the works of his predecessors like Balanchine did with Petipas ballets. I dont feel like Im stealing something. There is a good side to it: You have the hand of someone behind you that supports you. Its a good feeling."}
{"text": "Court delays in the Bronx  so troublesome that state officials had to create special courts to clear a backlog of felony cases  remain unresolved and have fatally undermined the right to trial for tens of thousands of people charged each year with low-level offenses, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday.The suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan and seeks class-action status, depicts a broken system in which hundreds of people arrive each morning and wait for hours or even a day for perfunctory court appearances.Defendants often end up having to return to court repeatedly before their cases are dismissed or go to trial, according to the suit, which was filed by two law firms and the Bronx Defenders, which provides legal representation to poor people.Robin Steinberg, the Bronx Defenders executive director, said delays for people charged with misdemeanors  the lawsuits focus  had only gotten worse in recent years. Last year, there were more than 45,000 misdemeanor arraignments in the Bronx, according to court statistics cited in the suit. Ms. Steinberg said the misdemeanor cases accounted for the vast majority of the people entering the system.We see the impact of intractable delays on the lives of our clients every day, she said in an interview. They suffer financially and psychologically  losing wages, missing school, scrambling to find child care.The filing comes three years after The New York Times published a series of articles on the delays in the Bronx courts, describing how a lack of resources and a culture of delay had crippled the system, creating a huge backlog of cases that undermined a tenet of the American justice system: the right to a speedy trial.As public outrage over the issue crested, state court officials created the dedicated courts, giving judges in those parts a mandate to produce more plea agreements and push felony cases to trial. That effort had some success in ridding the calendar of older felonies and easing the backlog.Last year, Jonathan Lippman, who was then New York States chief judge, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, announced a second initiative to speed up the cases of hundreds of defendants jailed at Rikers Island for more than a year on felony charges. Special Supreme Court parts were created, which are operated by experienced judges who apply pressure to prosecutors and defense lawyers to move cases along.Yet delays have continued to plague the lower courts in the Bronx, which handle the misdemeanor cases, such as trespassing, turnstile jumping, marijuana possession and minor assaults.The system more closely resembles punishment than due process, the lawsuit said.Because people are not scheduled for specific times in court, they may have to take off an entire day from work, the suit says, and when they finally go before a judge, their appearance may last just a few minutes before the case is postponed to another date.Defendants charged with misdemeanors in the Bronx regularly see their cases languish far past the 60- and 90-day speedy trial limits set down in state law for various low-level offenses, because delays caused by the courts crowded calendar rather than the district attorney are not counted toward the limit. Defendants who wish to go to trial must often wait years and sometimes never get their day in court, a 2013 study showed.The delays are caused by a shortage of judges, court officers and court reporters that keep trial parts idle and locked, the lawsuit said. Misdemeanor defendants must wait on average 642 days for a bench trial and 827 days for a jury trial in the Bronx, far longer than in New York Citys other boroughs, according to the lawsuit. It noted that over 500 misdemeanor cases had been pending for more than two years.In one case, a 40-year-old single mother was charged in 2012 with a count of misdemeanor assault; it was not until November 2015  1,166 days after her initial arraignment  that she received an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, a disposition that requires no admission of guilt, according to the lawsuit.Another man, Joseph Bermudez, a 36-year-old Bronx resident, was arrested in 2012 on suspicion of drunken driving, the lawsuit says. He received a bench trial in December 2015  1,255 days after his initial arraignment  and was acquitted, the suit says. In a phone interview, Mr. Bermudez, a warehouse manager at an appliance company, said he had to use overtime as well as vacation days and personal and sick leave to attend many of the court appearances.The defendants named in the lawsuit are Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo; the states chief judge, Janet DiFiore; and Lawrence K. Marks, the court systems chief administrative judge. The private firms that are helping to represent the plaintiffs are Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady and Morrison & Foerster.Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for Judge DiFiore, who took office in January, declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, but acknowledged that chronic delays in Bronx courts were a troubling phenomenon, one the judge highlighted in her first policy speech.The issue of case backlogs and delays in the state courts, particularly in the Bronx, are an absolute top priority and from her first day, have been directly addressed by the new chief judge, Mr. Chalfen said. She and senior court administrators are actively engaged in working on resolving the problem to the expectations and standards that we expect from the state court system.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said the complaint was under review.The lawsuit seeks reforms, not damages. Ms. Steinberg cited ideas such as excusing all defendants from having to appear for every court hearing, allocating more judges and court staff to the Bronx and creating flexible appearance times, including in the evening.Clearly, there are things that can be done immediately to lessen the burden on people, she said.Councilman Rory I. Lancman, a Queens Democrat, led oversight hearings in February on the delays in the citys criminal courts. Mr. Lancman said a shortage of judges, court officers and courtrooms were the major reasons for the backlogs, not just in the Bronx but across the city.Mr. Lancman said Mr. de Blasio had the power under state law to appoint 107 criminal court judges and had filled all but a few of those positions. Still, he said, only about half of those judges currently serve in the criminal courts, because state administrators have transferred them to hear felony cases. About two dozen civil judges have also been shifted to hear criminal cases.There are just not enough judges, Mr. Lancman said. The Office of Court Administration is doing its best to shuffle the deck chairs on the Titanic, but its still the Titanic."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee demanded on Tuesday that Facebook explain how it handles news articles in its trending list, responding to a report that staff members had intentionally suppressed articles from conservative sources.In a letter, the chairman, Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, asked Facebook to describe the steps it was taking to investigate the claims and to provide any records about articles that its news curators had excluded or added. Mr. Thune also asked directly whether the curators had in fact manipulated the content, something Facebook denied in a statement on Monday.If theres any level of subjectivity associated with it, or if, as reports have suggested that there might have been, an attempt to suppress conservative stories or keep them from trending and get other stories out there, I think its important for people to know that, Mr. Thune told reporters on Tuesday. Thats just a matter of transparency and honesty, and there shouldnt be any attempt to mislead the American public.Mr. Thunes actions raised further questions about the content seen by the 1.6 billion people who regularly use Facebook. The platforms growing role as an arena for news distribution has raised some concerns that it could have undue influence over the flow of information, but any effort by the federal government to regulate or investigate editorial decisions could run into First Amendment protections.Among Facebook users, 63 percent consider the platform to be a news service, according to a Pew Study. The company could ignore or refuse to comply with Mr. Thunes requests on First Amendment grounds, said Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment lawyer.The notion of Congress looking into or investigating how a medium of communication decides what to say threatens on its face First Amendment rights, said Mr. Abrams, a partner at the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.Facebook, in a response to Mr. Thunes letter, said that it was continuing to investigate whether any violations took place and that it looked forward to addressing his questions. The company is also planning to brief the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the allegations, according to a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Trending Topics is designed to surface popular conversations  no matter where they fall on the political spectrum  and our guidelines require the review team members to allow all points of view, Debbie Frost, Facebooks vice president for international and policy communications, said in a statement.Other social media companies have faced questions about their editorial guidelines and the ability to give some content a more prominent place on their platforms. Last fall, Twitter started Moments, a section of the app and website in which it displays the latest noteworthy tweets and news stories collected by a team of journalists. Snapchat, a messaging app, employs a former CNN reporter for its political coverage.But none of those companies have faced the same level of scrutiny as Facebook. The social media giant was accused of liberal bias after the leaking of a memo from Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, in which he called for employees to stop crossing out Black Lives Matter slogans on the walls of the companys headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Asked about the claims that conservative articles were suppressed, which were first reported by the website Gizmodo, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, demurred, encouraging the news media to take up the investigation.Obviously, we were pleased to see the statement from Facebook, you know, making pretty clear that this was not something that they engaged in, he said on Tuesday. You know, obviously, we can  you can ask them directly for a better explanation of what people may be seeing.Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, fired back at Republicans, not over the substance of their inquiry, but over focusing on Facebook instead of on other issues facing the country.The Republican Senate refuses to hold hearings on Judge Garland, refuses to fund the presidents request for Zika aid and takes the most days off of any Senate since 1956, but thinks Facebook hearings are a matter of urgent national interest, he wrote in an email to reporters. The taxpayers who pay Republican senators salaries probably want their money back."}

{"text": "The Citadel announced on Tuesday that it had denied a prospective student permission to wear a hijab with her uniform, ending a nearly monthlong period of considering what would have been the first change to the 174-year-old institutions uniforms.The Citadels president, Lt. Gen. John Rosa, said that while the college in Charleston, S.C., often arranged for transportation to religious services and made accommodations for prayer and diets based on religion, it would stop short of changing the uniform. He added that officials hoped the student would still attend.As the Military College of South Carolina, the Citadel has relied upon a highly effective educational model requiring all cadets to adopt a common uniform, General Rosa said. Uniformity is the cornerstone of this four-year leader development model.But a spokesman for the family, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Tuesday that the student would not attend the college because she had been denied her religious rights.Mr. Hooper, who said he had spoken with the students father, described her as heartbroken and in tears when she learned of the Citadels decision, which he said stood in opposition to past decisions by the military to accommodate religious dress.He also said all legal options were being considered and expressed confidence that the decision would be challenged in court. We just cant leave an unconstitutional, and frankly un-American, policy to stand, he said.The family has declined to reveal the identity of the student and her home state, Mr. Hooper said.The commitment to uniformity has long been a foundation of institutions that are conduits to the United States military. That commitment is being tested as Americans engage in widespread cultural and religious debates questioning the status quo in Hollywood, politics and everyday life. The men and women with roles in the armed forces are also getting caught up in the debate.The United States Military Academy at West Point announced on Tuesday that it would not discipline a group of 16 black female students who had raised their fists while posing for a photo in traditional dress gray uniform. Some, though, have criticized the women, complaining that they had invoked a symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement and sowed divisions in a military that relies on assimilation. But others who were in touch with the students said the gesture was not political.These ladies werent raising their fist to say Black Panthers.  Mary Tobin, a West Point graduate, told The New York Times. They were raising it to say Beyonc. But a United States Army captain who was allowed to wear a religious beard and turban while in uniform rejects the idea that uniformity upholds the militarys standards for discipline and safety.In the Army, people care how good you are at your job, Capt. Simratpal Singh, a Sikh and a decorated officer, told The New York Times. Are you a leader? Do you work hard? Then having a turban and a beard doesnt change anything.The Army announced in April that it had given Captain Singh permission to wear the beard and turban despite what the military had said was a need for uniformity and strict safety standards. He had also filed a lawsuit against the Defense Department, accusing it of religious discrimination after he was subjected to special helmet and gas mask testing.News of the students request at the Citadel was reported by The Washington Post after Nick Pinelli, a cadet, wrote a lengthy post on Facebook, saying that the college would be promoting inequality if it allowed the student to wear a hijab.Equality means the same set of rules for everyone, Mr. Pinelli wrote, not different rules for different people. It means accepting everyone, and giving them the same tools to succeed as the rest."}
{"text": "Here is the bad news and the good news about fava beans.First, the bad: Sorry, but a cook has to spend a fair amount of time and effort with them, and theres no getting around it. The first step is shucking the beans from their giant pods. Wait, theres more: Each bean must then be peeled individually. Removing the gray outer skin to reveal the bright green jewel within is without question a chore.The good news, however, is that fava beans are exquisitely delicious.If you can get your hands on some small, smooth young pods (about the diameter of a small carrot and about four inches long), the peeling question is moot, because no beans have yet formed inside them. The pods can be grilled whole over coals or cooked a la plancha or stir-fried in a hot wok. Chopped to add to a vegetable soup, the immature pods stand in nicely for tender green beans.For the first favas that show up at the market in late spring, many find peeling is unnecessary, and its true that when the beans are very small  no bigger than a pea  they are tender enough to eat skin and all. (Still, some fava fanatics peel even the tiny ones.)Another way to avoid peeling is by roasting larger favas in their skins, coated with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. Hot from the oven, they make a great snack, eaten one by one with your fingers, sucking the bean from the skin. And eating raw favas straight from the pod with pecorino cheese and salami is another time-honored treat throughout Italy.But generally, when the beans are fully formed and get to be the size of large lima beans (each pod will have six or eight), they taste and look better naked. They really should be peeled, especially for these lovely mashed favas on toast. Peeling can be done in stages, even a day ahead, with an assistant if possible.With the work of peeling out of the way, you will be glad to know that the mash comes together quickly. A little olive oil and garlic, a splash of water, some chopped rosemary and just a few minutes on the stove. Larger, somewhat starchier favas work best.The ambrosial warm green spread on freshly toasted baguette rounds is the perfect spring aperitif. Even though it takes about five pounds of fava beans in the pod to yield a small bowlful of mashed favas, this labor of love is worth it.Recipes: Mashed Fava Bean Toasts | More Spring DishesAnd to Drink ...The rich, green flavor of fava beans calls for white wines that are crisp and lively with herbal elements. Im thinking of Chablis, particularly young, straightforward village Chablis rather than the more complex premier cru or grand cru bottles. Sancerre, like Chablis, combines herbal and mineral flavors in a fresh way that would complement favas beautifully. Other options include vivacious whites like fianos from Campania, good Orvietos from Umbria or vermentinos from Liguria. You can also try pinot blancs from Alsace, Austria or Oregon. Silence of the Lambs buffs can always pull out a nice Chianti. As for the liver, youre on your own. ERIC ASIMOV"}

Donald J. Trump also won in the state, as well as in Nebraska, although his two remaining rivals left the race last week.Mrs. Clinton won West Virginia over Mr. Obama in 2008. And Mr. Obama received a primary challenge there in 2012 from a Texas felon who won some counties there. The politics of the state have been hard to cleave away from racial lines.But Mrs. Clinton struggled in the state, not just because of her alliance with Mr. Obama, but also because of her missteps in discussing the coal industry. A comment, lifted out of context but clunky nonetheless, about the coal industry and people being put out of business followed her there, and she faced protests from coal workers during campaign stops.Primaries are not necessarily bellwethers for how candidates will fare in a general election. But Mrs. Clinton will have work to do with white working-class voters in the fall in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania.And so Mr. Sanderss candidacy continues, a fact that has exasperated some of Mrs. Clintons supporters, particularly as Mr. Trump has sewn up his race weeks before people expected him to. But if there is a silver lining for Mrs. Clinton, it is that Mr. Sanderss lingering presence gives her cover to settle on an effective course against Mr. Trump, something her team does not yet seem to have done."}
{"text": "Planets keep falling out of the sky for the Kepler spacecraft. And as their number grows, so grows the age-old dream of ending human cosmic loneliness.Astronomers operating NASAs planet-finding spacecraft announced Tuesday that they had validated the planethood of 1,284 new candidates from Keplers voluminous catalog of potential exoplanets, the largest collection of new planets announced at one time. It brings the total of actual planets Kepler has discovered to more than 2,000.All of them orbit stars in a patch of sky on the Cygnus-Lyra border, where Kepler, launched in 2009, spent four years staring at 150,000 stars looking for the characteristic dimming when planets crossed their faces, until its pointing system broke down and the team had to develop a new observing strategy. Since then, Kepler has identified some 4,700 possible planets, and more keep being found.In the past, it took lengthy and arduous ground-based telescopic observations to winnow impostors like double stars and other pretenders from the planet list. But the numbers have grown too large, the cosmos too verdant, for this case-by-case analysis.The new results rely on a statistical technique developed by Timothy Morton, an astronomer at Princeton University, to vet the potential candidates in bulk, by analyzing the shape of the dips they make in starlight and taking into account how common the various types of impostors are and assigning a reliability score to each one.Planet candidates can be thought of like bread crumbs, said Dr. Morton in a NASA teleconference on Tuesday. If you drop a few large crumbs on the floor, you can pick them up one by one. But if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, youre going to need a broom. This statistical analysis is our broom.So far, two dozen of the planets found and confirmed by Kepler occupy the so-called Goldilocks zones of their stars where liquid water and perhaps Life as We Think We Know It could exist.Extrapolating these results to the entire galaxy, Natalie Batalha, Kepler mission scientist from the Ames Research Center, said there could be 10 billion roughly Earth-size planets in the galaxy within their stars habitable zones. The nearest habitable planet, she estimated, could be as close as 11 light-years. In the cosmic scheme of things, that is next door and reachable in our lifetimes with current or near-future technology. Last month, scientists announced a plan to try to send smartphone-like spacecraft to Alpha Centauri, which is 4.4 light-years away.Kepler was conceived as a mission to determine how common Earth-size planets, possible habitable rocks, are in the universe. The Kepler team, Dr. Batalha said, is now approaching in the next year or two the closeout of that mission, one that has helped change humanitys view of how friendly the cosmos might be to life, and has made exoplanets one of the most explosive fields in astronomy.That quest will go on. Kepler will be passing the baton to future missions like NASAs TESS, which will search for planets around nearby bright stars, starting in 2017."}
{"text": "MANILA  As mayor of Davao City in the southern Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte sometimes drove a taxi at night, to see firsthand what was happening in his city. On other occasions, when his car got stuck in a traffic jam, he would jump out and try to untangle the mess personally, according to Luzviminda Ilagan, a former member of Davaos city council.Mr. Duterte, who is all but certain to be the Philippines next president, is known for a disregard for civil rights and made international headlines with off-color remarks about subjects like rape. But he also has a reputation for a hands-on style of leadership, one that has endeared him to many Filipinos and helps to explain his success in the Monday election.He is perceived as a very strong personality with ideas to put immediately into action, said Ms. Ilagan, who has known Mr. Duterte for more than 30 years. He is willing to try anything new. He is not afraid to be innovative. And he is not afraid to go against the traditional way.With more than 92 percent of the votes counted Tuesday, Mr. Duterte appeared to have an unbeatable lead in the presidential race. Unofficial returns showed him with nearly 39 percent of the vote, putting him more than 15 percentage points ahead of his closest competitor.Its with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people, the Agence France-Presse news agency quoted Mr. Duterte as saying early Tuesday as the returns were coming in. I feel a sense of gratitude to the Filipino people.Mr. Duterte visited his mothers grave and cried early Tuesday, according to video posted on YouTube.Both of Mr. Dutertes top rivals, former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and Senator Grace Poe, had conceded by Tuesday afternoon. Digong, I wish you success, Mr. Roxas, who had been polling in second place, said Tuesday, referring to Mr. Duterte by his nickname and acknowledging that he had won.Senator Poe, who at one point had been leading in the polls, conceded on Monday night, saying she had telephoned Mr. Duterte to congratulate him. I promise to join in the healing of our nation and to unify our countrymen for the sake of our countrys progress, she said.In the Philippines, candidates for the highest offices need only a plurality to win, and it is common for victors to receive less than 40 percent of the vote.During the campaign, Mr. Duterte touted his record in making Davao safe from crime using extreme measures, saying last year that his crime-fighting strategy was kill them all. If elected, he said recently, he would aggressively pursue those who break the law, vowing to kill them himself and grant himself a presidential pardon.Mr. Duterte has been accused of having ties to death squads that carried out extrajudicial killings in Davao during one of his previous terms as mayor, in the 1990s. In a television interview during the presidential campaign, he appeared to confirm his involvement in the killing of criminals in Davao. Some in Davao have praised his approach, saying that the police in the city know that they have to do their jobs.At a campaign rally, he made light of the rape and murder of an Australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in Davao, when Mr. Duterte was mayor. He later apologized.Such language has offended many, but Mr. Dutertes blunt talk has also resonated with Filipinos who have become tired of the more measured tones of President Benigno S. Aquino III.Mr. Aquino, who was barred by term limits from seeking re-election, has voiced alarm about the prospect of a Duterte presidency, saying it was tantamount to a return to the dictatorship of the Ferdinand Marcos years. He had called on other candidates to unite to defeat Mr. Duterte, but none agreed.Despite strong economic growth and resurgent foreign investment, the Philippines still has high levels of poverty and unemployment, crumbling infrastructure, and a raging war in the southern part of the country against insurgents and kidnap-for-ransom gangs.Filipinos cast their ballots separately for president and vice president, and in late counting on Tuesday in the vice-presidential race, Maria Leonor Robredo, a member of the House of Representatives, had overtaken Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the former dictator, by a slim margin.Mr. Marcos, known by his nickname Bongbong, was seeking a return to national prominence for the family name. His father, who was backed by the United States, was forced from office by the people power movement in 1986. Ms. Robredo was leading Mr. Marcos by fewer than 200,000 votes out of some 40 million cast.In the Senate contest, the retired boxer Manny Pacquiao was running eighth and appeared likely to win one of 12 open seats.Mr. Dutertes spokesman, Peter Lavina, said at a news conference that the new president would attempt to change the constitution and shift power to the regions while trying to negotiate peace with rebel groups that have long battled the central government.Ms. Ilagan, the former Davao city council member, who also served in Congress, said she believed that Mr. Dutertes willingness to be frank and spontaneous made him the kind of leader who could bring an end to the conflicts.He expresses what others are not able to say in polite society, she said. He is friendly and open to all sides, which is exciting for his presidency."}
{"text": "Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday rebutted complaints that the United States is impeding others from investing and trading with Iran despite the easing of sanctions against that country under the nuclear agreement that took effect in January.Mr. Kerry said that some businesses were misusing the United States as an excuse.Many big banks and companies in Europe and Asia have hesitated to engage with Iran, partly for fear of inadvertently violating non-nuclear American sanctions that remain in effect against the Iranians, including severe restrictions on their use of the dollar.The hesitancy has angered Iran, which agreed to wide restraints on its nuclear activities under the deal and had expected a huge lift to its economy in return, an outcome that has yet to happen. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Irans supreme leader, has accused the United States of stealthily subverting the agreement, an assertion that American officials have denied.In a meeting with a small group of reporters in London, where he was preparing to meet with European bankers, Mr. Kerry acknowledged some confusion about the rules under the agreement, but he said that the United States was happy to explain them.Iran has a right to the benefits of the agreement they signed up to, and if people by confusion or misinterpretation or, in some cases, disinformation are being misled, its appropriate for us to try to clarify that, Mr. Kerry said in the meeting. A transcript was posted on the State Department website.Mr. Kerry also suggested that some companies were using the American sanctions that remain in force as a guise for not venturing into Iran. They shouldnt say, Oh, we cant do it because of the United States,  Mr. Kerry said. Thats just not fair. Thats not accurate. And we sometimes get used as an excuse in this process.The system of American sanctions on Iran, he said, is just not as complicated as some people make it.Mr. Kerry also rejected suggestions that the next American president would scrap the nuclear agreement. Many Republican politicians have denounced the agreement, including Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The two Democrats competing for their partys nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have expressed support for it.I just dont believe that a new president regardless  is going to suddenly say, Lets go have a war in the Middle East, and give up the restraint on a nuclear weapon, Mr. Kerry said. I just dont think the advisers to that president or anybody are going to suggest that that makes sense.Still, the agreement has done little to ease the atmosphere of hostility and suspicion that has prevailed between Iran and the United States.The Iranians have since seized on other American actions they view as arrogant affronts, including a Supreme Court ruling last month that cleared the way for the use of impounded Iranian assets to compensate American victims of attacks attributed to Iran.Iran is also likely to be irritated by a federal lawsuit filed against it on Monday by Amir Hekmati, the Marine veteran who was among the imprisoned Americans released by the Iranians when the nuclear deal went into effect four months ago.The lawsuit, filed by Mr. Hekmatis lawyers in Washington, is seeking unspecified damages for Mr. Hekmatis four-and-a-half-year incarceration and torture in Tehrans Evin Prison. Mr. Hekmati has said that the charges under which Iran detained him were fabricated.Our intention, with the filing of this lawsuit, is to attempt to provide at least some measure of justice for Amir and his family, Mr. Hekmatis lawyer, Scott D. Gilbert, said in a statement.There was no immediate comment on the lawsuit from Iranian officials. But Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has described any American court proceedings against Iran as a violation of international law."}
{"text": "Last November, after the Philadelphia Orchestra played One Land, One River, One People, a quirkily mystical new oratorio by the American jazz-classical musician who goes by Hannibal, the composer bounded onstage for a bow. A hulking man with a spray of braids, he headed straight for the orchestras music director, Yannick Nzet-Sguin, who at 41 is boyish, diminutive and widely considered to be one of the most talented conductors of his generation.Hannibal embraced Mr. Nzet-Sguin and, grinning broadly, lifted him a few feet in the air. The audience went wild; Mr. Nzet-Sguin seemed unembarrassed  even delighted. As I watched, I asked myself: Is there another conductor in the world of his skill and stature who could have pulled off the moment?Its that sense of charisma and charm he exudes, coupled with broad and swiftly developing technical gifts, that have brought him to the forefront of his field. With James Levine now officially retired as the music director of the Metropolitan Opera, much of the speculation about his successor has revolved around Mr. Nzet-Sguin.There are many reasons to celebrate the possibility of his coming to New York. He made his Met debut with a galvanizing Carmen in 2009  has that opera ever opened so explosively?  and in 2013 led a sumptuous La Traviata, its dramatic twists underlined with grand, and sudden, shifts of speed.His conducting can be fierce and assertive but, as in a 2014 Rusalka, nuanced, too: He found subtle echoes of Dvoraks haunting door-knock motif all over the score. Most impressive has been the speed of his maturation. Compare his takes on Don Carlo in 2010 and 2015; the more recent version was ineffably yet unmistakably deeper, as Mr. Nzet-Sguin did something unusual with the duet for Carlo and Elisabetta. He lightened the orchestral textures, making the music seem to emerge from another time and place, a profound vehicle for the agony of the characters lost love. This was opera conducting on the highest level. Ill never forget it.But what kind of music director would Mr. Nzet-Sguin be? Elsewhere, he has led operas from Monteverdi to Janacek, but his work at the Met has been squarely in the standard repertory.In Philadelphia, too, where I traveled for a number of performances this season, Mr. Nzet-Sguin has been confident, yet his broader intentions, his artistic identity, has felt vague. The Philadelphia Orchestra is among the most conservative of the major American ensembles. While it presents a handful of premieres, including One Land, One River, One People, those dont seem to define it: Over the orchestras four concerts at Carnegie Hall this year, just 12 minutes  the length of HK Grubers Charivari  was devoted to music by living composers.Maybe there was not a cultivation enough of whats new, he said in a recent telephone conversation of the Philadelphia audience before his arrival. And when I say new, I dont mean just recently composed music, but anything off the beaten path. Its up to me to broaden the spectrum of what they love.When I asked him, though, which underappreciated composers, works or corners of the repertory he might seek to champion  the Nzet-Sguin equivalents of Mr. Levines advocacy for Berg, marginalized Mozart or Moses und Aron  he seemed slightly at a loss.Its still a bit at the beginning, he said of his career. Im still at the stage when I enjoy so much broadening my repertory and the orchestras. If someone was someday to say, Yannick has helped bring back this composer, Im not sure who it would be.Those arent reassuring words. From its next music director, the Met should want a personal, passionate vision for the repertory as much as an exciting persona and technical chops. Well before he was Mr. Nzet-Sguins age, Mr. Levine was already using his power at the Met to give, for example, the company premiere of Bergs Lulu. (It was, admittedly, a very different world back then, and a very different, more malleable opera house.)Mr. Nzet-Sguin mentioned wanting to be a voice in the concert hall for Kurt Weill and Szymanowski  neither of whom is really lacking for performances these days, though Weills brooding Second Symphony had never been done in Philadelphia before he led it there. He also mentioned that when he ran a Baroque ensemble in his early days in Montreal, he programmed unfamiliar helpings of Zelenka, the overlooked Czech master. But for better or (I think) worse, he would not arrive at the Met with an agenda, particularly in modern and contemporary music.Part of the problem  but its not entirely a problem  is that he has seemed more keen to fit his repertory to the needs of his ensembles than to mold orchestras in his likeness. The Rotterdam Philharmonic, of which hes been principal conductor since 2008, was previously led by Valery Gergiev, who emphasized his native Russian music.I felt the orchestra needed from me a certain level of refinement to the sound, Mr. Nzet-Sguin said. So the French repertory was just suited to what they needed: the discipline, the lower dynamics. And in the past few years, we are again doing Russian repertory, but with this added palette.In Philadelphia, where he has been music director since 2012, there was the opposite issue: The orchestra had been fed a steady diet of French music, and Mr. Nzet-Sguin, wanting to get back to the ensembles signature rich, sustained sound, thought that Strauss, Mahler and Bruckner were the thing to begin with. Only next season will he really bring the players back to major French works.Its not to revolutionize the orchestra, he said, speaking generally of how he envisions a directors proper role. Its to take the institution, see what it means, evaluate it from inside.The results I witnessed in Philadelphia this season have been well-executed  and even, on occasion, idiosyncratic: Mr. Nzet-Sguin led a lovely, poignantly restrained Messiah this winter that was creamier and gentler than the crisp, sharp norm these days.But the Met doesnt suffer from the kind of stylistic imbalance that he observed when he started in Rotterdam or Philadelphia. It is Mr. Levines great achievement that his ensemble is at this point largely faultless, whether its playing Handel or Nico Muhly.Were Mr. Nzet-Sguin to join the company, it would be an event worth applauding. His performances are exciting and thoughtful, and he would be an energetic, peerlessly personable advocate for the company  and for opera. But while his geniality and ability both seem nearly endless, the Met and Mr. Nzet-Sguin would do well  now, not once hes begun  to think carefully about his vision, about what he would bring to the job that no one else could.The guidance now required in New York is broader, a question less of reviving a tradition or recalibrating a sound than of managing the direction of an entire art form. Mr. Nzet-Sguin would doubtless give us memorable takes on Otello. Is that enough?"}

A hostess sets down thick, leather menus in one, two, three places before proceeding to drop a flimsy half-piece of paper in front of my brother. He scrunches his eyebrows together and glares at my parents as if to say not this again  the kid-menu debacle that automatically ensues when you have Down syndrome. Hes 22 years old, a working man with a diploma, yet abled people always seem to have one inability: to see him as anything but a kid.Fortunately, the world is changing  with implementations like Best Buddies, Rosas Law and the Americans With Disabilities Act. But a couple of things are keeping America from fully including and involving people with disabilities into everyday life naturally: societys colloquial language and the style of disability advocacy.Thankfully, Spread the Word to End the Word and similar campaigns have attempted to mark words like retarded as taboo (however, 56 percent of Americans dont think its offensive to call themselves the r-word, and 38 percent dont find a problem in calling their friends it either). But left in their wake are boom-boom, mental and slow. Of course, any well-intentioned person can forget and succumb to using these words  but if we ever want to see full integration, we have to let them go.Some say that nitpicking words like crazy and lame will just start another political correctness battle, and that there is no easy way to eliminate them. But before deeming this challenge too hard, think about how difficult it is for 48.9 million Americans to not only have a disability, but to be reminded of it in everyday conversations.Another problem arises in the fact that two-thirds of people claim to be uncomfortable talking to people with disabilities because they dont know how to act politely around them. This awkward silence is too often filled with well-meaning (yet meaningless) statements like Youre Gods special gift. But again, people who are uncomfortable around those with disabilities arent usually out to discriminate. However, with the rise of politicians like Donald Trump, who mocked a reporter with arthrogryposis, more citizens are following the path to discriminatory speech.Lastly, viral posts about those with disabilities have lately been deemed inspiration porn, mainly for the reason that theyve been used to inspire a retweet or a reblog, but no actual action. These posts make it seem as if the only purpose of those with disabilities is to inspire abled people  not to live a fulfilling life in the way they please.Many of us possess good intentions about disabilities  but if we really want to solve ableism in America, we have to watch our patterns of speech (even jokes) and consider taking action instead of just hitting repost.Works CitedHaberman, Maggie.

{"text": "To the Editor:Re What I Got Wrong About Donald Trump, by Nate Cohn (The Upshot, May 5):I am tired of the repeated mea culpas and breast-beating on the part of journalists in general, and The Times in particular, regarding the unlikely rise of Donald Trump. It is not that the pundits guessed wrong about the outcomes of various primary contests.The real deficiency of journalists has been that (1) they failed to take Mr. Trumps candidacy seriously enough to dig for the truth underlying his most flamboyant statements; and (2) they gave Mr. Trump virtually unlimited access to the print and TV platforms that they control.A case in point is the May 6 news article about Mr. Trump eating a taco (Outreach to Hispanics: Taco Bowls). Oh, please, do your jobs as journalists. In short, you have not served the American people and their government well.ROBERT N. ROSSCambridge, Mass.To the Editor:Heres my upshot. Heres what should have been on Nate Cohns list of what he and others got wrong:For entirely too long working-class people have been dismissed as not smart enough, their passion rooted in racism, love of guns, white male dominance or the need for a beer. As with most people in the United States, for them it really boils down to its the economy, stupid.Their motives have been downgraded; theyve been dismissed and talked over. Theyve noticed that, and theyre fuming now. At election time a few politicians (from both parties) pretend to care, pretend to like pork rinds, pretend to be on the working classs side  but its mostly baloney.I was raised in a working-class union household. I am very lucky to have gotten a good college education and now live in an elite economic bubble, from which I can see both perspectives. For the last 30 years I have been flinching at the disrespect and mistreatment of the working class that I hear and see every day. I have been wondering when they might fight back, and now they are.Its taken a terrifying form; Donald Trump is just one more in a long line of pretenders. But hes paying them the respect of saying it simply and mirroring what they feel. Although I would never vote for him, this does make him a more qualified candidate than most.Please stop hearing only elite voices. Please consider that the grievances of the working class come from economic stress, fear for their children and hope for the future. The disrespect I have witnessed is constant, without political boundaries and delivered with shocking ignorance, both in my neighborhood and in your paper.BARRETT MOOREMenlo Park, Calif.To the Editor:A follow-up to Nate Cohns insightful essay about what he got wrong about Donald Trump might examine what he and many others of us got wrong about the American electorate. When I was a boy early in F.D.R.s third term we celebrated a holiday then called I Am an American Day.We had our differences back then, but World War II had made us one people. It should not take a war to do that, but it would be hard to imagine such a holiday today, and almost impossible to say what many Americans share in common beyond citizenship and a reverence for money.Donald Trump astutely used our dissonance to gain the Republican nomination, demeaning many of the qualities we claim to value in our elected leadership and also hope to see in our children: decency, honesty, tolerance, respect for others, regard for women.Mr. Trumps advisers say well see a different Trump after the conventions. Maybe. But his nomination will present an opportunity in this election to decide not only who we want, but also who we are.DAVID KERNISTrumbull, Conn.To the Editor:Nate Cohn says that maybe he underestimated Donald Trump. I say, maybe we overestimated Republican voters.RICHARD LADERNew YorkTo the Editor:Re The Republican Horse Race Is Over, and Journalism Lost, by Jim Rutenberg (Mediator column, May 9):It was refreshing to read Mr. Rutenbergs mea culpa on behalf of the Fourth Estate. Journalism somehow managed to get the Trump phenomenon wrong, wrong, wrong, while writing more and more about Trump, Trump, Trump.Mr. Rutenberg urges journalists to resist the urge to put ratings, clicks and ad sales above, well, good journalism. I hope The Times takes his advice to heart, but I am not optimistic.Mr. Rutenbergs article on the home page of the digital edition was accompanied by four (four!) other stories about Donald Trump. It was wall-to-wall Trump for breakfast. If the Fourth Estate is serious about making amends, a good start would be to stop feeding the monster.MISHA RASOVICHLos AngelesTo the Editor:The first few words of this article gave me hope that it would be a thoughtful analysis of the role of the media in the presidential primaries. After the first powerful three words  Wrong, wrong, wrong  I realized that the point of the article was that the media made incorrect predictions. That they did.But there is a more fundamental wrong to be explored. Jim Rutenberg and the rest of the media seem to think that an important part of their role is to make predictions. In my view, predictions are a powerful tool that influences the outcome of elections and works against what we desire in a democracy.The absence of predictions would encourage individuals to vote their consciences. The role of journalists is to draw out from the candidates the truth of their convictions and clarify their implementation plans if they are elected. It is also to confront them when they make misleading or contradictory statements. What is wrong, wrong, wrong is that the media makes predictions.HANAN WATSONNew York"}
{"text": "When a trophy-hunting American tourist killed Cecil the lion last year, the disturbing story gripped the public: He had been illegally lured out of the protected Zimbabwe game park where he lived by a rogue hunting guide. Cecil had been a favorite of safari tourists, whom hed sometimes approach and even seem to pose for, and he was also a key part of a continuing Oxford University wildlife behavior study. His loss was crushing to many. But there is more to the story, as Craig, Juliana and Isabella Hatkoff recount in Cecils Pride, an enlightening book filled with stunning photos taken by one of the researchers who tracked Cecil.The Hatkoffs are also the authors of the best seller Owen and Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship and of Knut: How One Little Polar Bear Captivated the World. They have an eye for fascinating true tales of animal relationships. Written in direct, workmanlike language, their books dont romanticize animal behavior, even as they focus on those aspects that tug at human hearts. While Cecils story does not feature cross-species bonding, as their other books do, an unusual connection lies at its core: Before his death, Cecil had forged a kinship with an unrelated male lion named Jericho  an extremely rare occurrence in the lion world. These two leaders joined forces, combining their families into one pride, when both were threatened by a pair of brothers intent on taking over their territory. After Cecils death, the researchers worried that Jericho would kill Cecils cubs. But Jericho  who emerges as the storys true hero returned to the pride and raised Cecils cubs as his own. In a book that ends with a note of alarm about the dire need for a ban on lion hunting, thats a remarkable happy ending, and more evidence for approaching wildlife with awe and respect, as there is always more to learn from and about them.Theres an unexpectedly happy ending, too, to Prairie Dog Song, which tells how this strange little North American species was wiped out of large swaths of the grasslands it once helped sustain. Prairie dogs are actually a kind of squirrel, and as the book explains, they are whats known as a keystone species, one that helps other animals and plants in their ecosystem survive. The vast grasslands of North America dont get enough rain to sustain trees. But grasses can grow there with the help of prairie dogs, who for centuries made cities of burrows that benefited the soil and provided a home to other creatures like burrowing owls, snakes and spiders. Bison, which also improved the soil with their clomping, fed on the rich grasses, and golden eagles and ferrets fed on the prairie dogs, which once numbered in the billions.The books first part lays out this grassland ecosystem with a friendly song, meant to be sung to the tune of The Green Grass Grows All Around. As each animal is introduced, prose set underneath the songs lyrics includes a concise, accessible scientific description of the role it played. But something interrupts the pattern: And then one year/ Came ranchers and farmers / With the fattest cows / That you ever did see. The settlers destroy the prairie dogs territory, covering it with houses and roads and putting poison in the burrows. The prairie dogs disappear, along with the bison and the ferrets. The mesquite trees the prairie dogs had kept in check by chewing the roots spread, draining the water and turning the area into desert. The authors then skip to recent years, when a conservation effort in northern Mexico has created a protected grassland reserve that is home to a growing population of prairie dogs and other grassland-dwellers. The song continues with the simple verses telling how this time the people  led, we learn below, by a scientist named Dr. Gerardo Ceballos  brought back each type of animal, rather than causing them to disappear.The books elements work together unusually well, with cumulative verses mirroring the interrelated nature of the grassland ecosystem without being simplistic or corny. Susan L. Roths cheerful, intricate mixed-media collages, too, form a visual embodiment of the grasslands unity from diversity, their careful layers integrating in just the right way to seem vibrantly whole."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO  Rio de Janeiro has missed a once-in-a-lifetime chance to clean polluted Guanabara Bay, the site for Olympic sailing, Brazils most decorated Olympic athlete said in a recent interview.We always hoped that having a big event like the Games would help, the athlete, Torben Grael, told Canadas CBC television. We ourselves put a lot of pressure to make it happen, but unfortunately it didnt happen when they had money. And now they dont have money, and so its even worse.Grael has won five Olympic medals in sailing: two gold, a silver and two bronze. He has sailed for years in Guanabara Bay and hoped the Olympics would prompt a wholesale cleanup.I dont think were going to see that change now, Grael said, according to a transcript of the interview given to The Associated Press this week. Its part of the way politics administration goes here. Everything grows very quick and very disorganized.Brazil is in the middle of its worst recession in decades, and the state of Rio de Janeiro has been described as broke by its acting governor, Francisco Dornelles.The state is responsible for maintaining the bay, which has been described as an open sewer by many local and foreign sailors.Rio treats only about half its sewage, dumping the rest untreated into the water around the city.A yearlong analysis of water quality by the A.P. has found dangerously high levels of viruses and bacteria in Olympic and Paralympic sites for sailing, rowing, canoeing, triathlon and long-distance swimming.The International Olympic Committee, backed by the World Health Organization, has repeatedly said athletes are not at risk.I dont think youre going to get sick, Grael said. It just looks terrible.Many athletes are expected to arrive in Rio in advance to build up immunity to possible diseases. Others will come in just days before, hoping to minimize the impact. Many will take antibiotics, bring bleach to cleanse equipment and try to limit their contact with the water.You know the garbage can slow your boat, and thats not good, Grael said. I think theyre going to be careful collecting the garbage in the racing areas, but thats going to be just for the Games, and after the Games its going to be what we know.We thought we could have some change, some legacy there. But its not going to happen, unfortunately."}
{"text": "When Gregory Porter was a young man beginning to find his way in the world  specifically, the part of the world known as Southern California  he often encountered reminders of the danger that flowed unseen around him. This wasnt unusual for a 20-something African-American man built like an outside linebacker, the position Mr. Porter played on scholarship at San Diego State. In certain situations, his mere presence could produce a shifty unease, a tension he felt obliged to disarm.My brother used humor, he said. I used my voice.Mr. Porter, a singer-songwriter known for his rafters-raising baritone, was speaking in a Times Square hotel room a few months ago, on the eve of his third annual Valentines Day concert at Town Hall. If I was walking behind a woman, or if I walked into a store, he went on, I would just sing some intelligent song. A criminal wouldnt do that. Somebody whos about to hit you over the head wouldnt be singing Waltz for Debby.A powerful voice used to soothing effect: Its an approach with special resonance for Mr. Porter as he rolls out his fourth album, Take Me to the Alley. Released on Friday on Blue Note, it features a dozen original songs with grown-up themes: social conscience, filial devotion, the solicitous work that helps sustain a lasting romance. Its an assured, unflashy follow-up to Liquid Spirit, which won the 2014 Grammy Award for best jazz vocal album and has sold nearly a million copies worldwide.With its deep confluence of jazz, gospel and soul, its a reassertion of core values after Mr. Porters breakout success in electronic dance music, thanks to Holding On, his collaboration with the British duo Disclosure last year, and a continuing rash of remixes by D.J.s and producers. Liquid Spirit (Claptone Remix) reached No. 1 on the Beatport Top 100, leading to the incongruous sight of Mr. Porter, in shorts and a golf polo, performing to a sea-breezy young crowd in Ibiza.Take Me to the Alley opens with a version of Holding On that could be Mr. Porters own organic remix: easeful, acoustic, with a beat thats more insinuated than declared. As a whole, the album contains some of his loveliest singing on record, rooted in the comfort of an artist who knows that his audience will lean in to him. The title track is a hymn of service and compassion largely inspired by the memory of his mother, a storefront minister.Mr. Porter, 44, spends an enormous amount of time on the road  200 shows last year, 270 the year before  and recently moved with his wife, Victoria, and 3-year-old son from Brooklyn to Bakersfield, Calif., where he spent his youth. Its a stones throw from where my mother had her churches, he said. I find that the closer I get to her energy, the truer I am to myself.Bakersfield was a crucible for Mr. Porter, who grew up in a close-knit African-American minority that had mostly migrated from the rural South. He experienced harrowing racism. My brother got shot because he was walking in an all-white neighborhood, he said. Weekend after weekend, they would urinate in beer bottles and throw them through our windows. They threw pumpkins and watermelons through the windows. They burned a cross on the front yard.The image of a broken window crops up on Mr. Porters new album, but under strikingly different circumstances: Break a window and let the sun in, he sings in Fan the Flames, which he wrote on the road last year, after watching footage of protests in Ferguson, Mo. The songs title turns out to be a head fake, as Mr. Porter urges a flare-up of nonviolence: Stand up on your seat with your dirty feet/Raise your fist in the air  and be sweet.Mr. Porter has memorably sung about civil rights protests before  his song 1960 What? is a soulful, righteous howl  but here, in a charged present tense, he ends up sounding like an admonishing elder. A fist raised in sweetness, which might seem quaint in the face of the Black Lives Matter movement, is nevertheless consistent with his ethic of magnanimous restraint.Music always came naturally to Mr. Porter, but he took a roundabout path to pursuing it with any focus. After an injury sidelined his college football career, he worked odd jobs and sat in at local clubs, with guidance from a music mentor, the saxophonist and pianist Kamau Kenyatta. Mr. Porter also found a home in theater, appearing in It Aint Nothin but the Blues, a revue that ran on Broadway, and then developing a one-man show, Nat King Cole & Me: A Musical Healing.He found his jazz footing in New York the old-fashioned way, becoming a fixture at uptown jam sessions. Water, his 2010 debut on the Motma label, introduced him as both a commanding singer and (more unusually) an insightful songwriter. There were strong suggestions from all corners that said, Your first record should be standards, Mr. Porter recalled. But the overwhelming energy of what I was feeling inside of me was what I wanted to say.Like one of his heroes, Bill Withers, Mr. Porter writes songs about family and everyday struggle, sketching a continuity. Dont Lose Your Steam, from the new album, could be a behest from his mother and a message to his son. Young man, Im counting on you, goes the refrain; in the music video, set in a barbershop, Mr. Porter bounces his son, Demyan, on one knee.His overwhelming subject is love, in its myriad forms and stages. At Town Hall, after wishing the crowd a happy Valentines Day, he announced his intention to celebrate love not only in a romantic sense, but also love for your brother or your neighborhood. Later in the show, he noted that a couple who got engaged at last years concert was in the audience.Im always lobbying for the irrepressible strength of love, Mr. Porter said. That platform has been consistent, whether hes singing at Buckingham Palace, as he did in 2014, or on an outdoor festival bill, as he will in the coming months. This thing has gotten me out of trouble, he added, referring to his voice. And this sound that emanates from the church, or from work songs or field hollers, has found its way to so many places that I let it go where its going to go."}
{"text": "They call it the poor mans methadone.The epidemic of opioid addiction sweeping the country has led to another form of drug abuse that few experts saw coming: Addicts who cannot lay hands on painkillers are instead turning to Imodium and other anti-diarrhea medications.The active ingredient, loperamide, offers a cheap high if it is consumed in extraordinary amounts. But in addition to being uncomfortably constipating, it can be toxic, even deadly, to the heart.A report published online in Annals of Emergency Medicine recently described two deaths in New York after loperamide abuse. And overdoses have been linked to deaths or life-threatening irregular heartbeats in at least a dozen other cases in five states in the last 18 months.Most physicians just recently realized loperamide could be abused, and few look for it. There is little if any national data on the problem, but many toxicologists and emergency department doctors suspect that it is more widespread than scattered reports suggest.As efforts to limit prescription opioids intensify, a handful of experts are concerned that more addicts might turn to loperamide  much as an alcoholic might resort to mouthwash when the Jim Beam runs dry.Weve seen patients who have been on loperamide for months at a time, said William Eggleston, the lead author of the recent report and a clinical toxicologist at SUNY Upstate Medical Center.He added, A subset of patients take it to get high, and other patients use it as a bridge  meaning that if they cannot obtain heroin or morphine, they take loperamide to ease withdrawal symptoms like muscle pains, vomiting, diarrhea and nausea.Sarah Peddicord, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, said, The F.D.A. is aware of recent reports of adverse events related to the intentional misuse and/or abuse of the anti-diarrhea product loperamide to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal or produce euphoric effects.After a review, she said, the agency will take appropriate steps as soon as possible.The recommended dose of loperamide is safe. The standard daily dose of Imodium A-D is no more than four caplets, or eight milligrams. But lobe abusers  as they sometimes call themselves  have reported ingesting 100 two-milligram tablets daily for weeks.In a case reported by Dr. Eggleston and his colleagues, a 24-year-old man experiencing opiate withdrawal took so much loperamide that he died. Toxicology analysis found more than 25 times the regular dose in his blood.In another case, a 39-year-old man collapsed at home and was pronounced dead at a hospital. His family said he had once managed his opioid addiction with prescription buprenorphine, but had taken to medicating with anti-diarrhea drugs.Anti-diarrhea medications are cheap, legal and can be bought easily in large quantities without raising suspicion. Costco sells 400 loperamide caplets for just $7.59.Yet loperamide used to be a prescription drug and a controlled substance, in the same class as cocaine or methadone. The F.D.A. approved it in 1976, and it became an over-the-counter drug in 1988.Typically, loperamide acts on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and does not enter the central nervous system. At recommended doses, there is no high, and low potential for abuse. But large doses can produce a high, doctors say.Some toxicologists argue that the sales of loperamide should be limited, much as the nonprescription drug pseudoephedrine was restricted a decade ago to help prevent the manufacturing of crystal meth.Its time for someone to step in and regulate the purchasing of massive quantities, said Dr. Chuck OConnell, an emergency medicine physician and toxicologist at the University of California, San Diego, who said he had seen two loperamide overdoses.The average person doesnt need 400 tablets of loperamide weekly, he said. Ive used a handful in my whole life.In the journal HeartRhythm Case Reports, he described a 28-year-old woman who said she had taken 400 to 600 milligrams of loperamide daily for months. An electrocardiogram showed dangerously irregular heartbeats and abnormal electrical conduction through her heart.After repeated blackouts, she sought medical attention at a hospital. While there, unknown to doctors, she was still taking 100 tablets of loperamide a day from a private stockpile.After she transferred to U.C.S.D. and confessed her habit, Dr. OConnell asked her to stop. In a few days, an electrocardiogram showed her heart normalizing, and the fainting subsided.If you take enough, it rushes the gate, and some penetrates the blood-brain barrier, Dr. OConnell said. Once it crosses the barrier, it can act on the central nervous system and you get euphoric effects.Some users complain the high does not compare to that produced by opioids. You can definitely get high from it, and even kill yourself with it, a commenter wrote in 2013 on Bluelight, a website where people discuss drug use.The high was not worth the health risks, whatever they are, the commenter wrote.Another commenter cataloged loperamides downsides  the need to continually take stool softeners, for one  but wrote that the medication took away the misery of opioid withdrawal: Dont wish to be dead  so thats a plus.Loperamide abuse may go undetected in emergency departments, experts warn, because routine drug screens cannot detect it.The urine toxicology we do in our hospital doesnt look for loperamide, so its possible we missed cases, said Amitava Dasgupta, a toxicologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.Some loperamide abusers arrive at hospitals lethargic or not breathing, as if they had overdosed on heroin. Naloxone, an anti-opioid drug, may be given.When a drug screen comes back negative, emergency room staff may assume the test was faulty, or by that time, if the patient is responsive, they may write it off as nothing, said Dr. Jennifer Dierksen, a pathologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.In one case at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, opioid abuse was suspected after a 19-year-old Texan was found dead at home with a distended bladder full of urine. But a drug screen was clean. So Jeffrey Walterscheid, then a toxicologist at the institute, used a test known as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to pinpoint loperamide as the culprit.All cases of cardiac problems associated with the misuse or abuse of loperamide should be reported to the F.D.A.s Medwatch online registry. But not all physicians do so.The more people sounding the alarm, the more likely the F.D.A. will take the problem seriously and take action, Dr. Eggleston said. A first step would be legislation or regulation that places the items behind the counter.Johnson & Johnson, Imodiums manufacturer, did not respond to requests for comment."}
{"text": "MINNEAPOLIS  A local doctor who had treated Prince twice in recent weeks showed up at the musicians estate near here on the morning he died, only to discover that he had just been pronounced dead after being found collapsed in an elevator of his home, according to a police affidavit.The doctor, Michael T. Schulenberg, had seen Prince the previous day, April 20, according to the affidavit, which was filed in connection with a search warrant for Princes medical records.The affidavit was filed by an investigator for the sheriffs office in Carver County, where Prince lived. Dr. Schulenberg, who practices family medicine, also saw Prince on April 7, the day he canceled a show in Atlanta, the warrant said.During his two visits, Dr. Schulenberg performed tests and prescribed medication for an undisclosed ailment, the affidavit said. Dr. Schulenberg said he had arrived at Princes compound to turn over the test results.The warrant sought medical records from the North Memorial Medical Center, which is part of the health system where Dr. Schulenberg used to work.Authorities have not released a cause of death, and have said that a determination might be weeks away. But Dr. Schulenbergs visit makes clear that Prince was actively receiving medical treatment before his death on April 21. He also was preparing to be treated for an opioid dependency from a California doctor, Howard Kornfeld.The doctors son, Andrew Kornfeld, and two friends of Prince initially found him collapsed. Andrew Kornfeld, who works for his fathers treatment center, had rushed on an overnight flight from San Francisco to get Prince enrolled in treatment, according to William Mauzy, a lawyer for the Kornfelds, who said the stars representatives had sought the help.Dr. Schulenberg, 46, has been licensed to practice in Minnesota since 1997. He has no disciplinary history, according to state records, and there are no allegations of wrongdoing on his part.Lesa Bader, a spokeswoman for Dr. Schulenbergs most recent employer, North Memorial Health Care, said she could not comment on Princes treatment because of medical privacy laws. Dr. Schulenberg worked for North Memorial when Prince was found dead but is no longer employed by the medical system. Ms. Bader said the hospital does not comment on personnel matters.Telephone messages left for Dr. Schulenberg were not returned.The affidavit lays out Princes earlier medical concerns. Kirk Johnson, a close friend, told investigators the star had visited another local hospital in 2014 or 2015 for an undisclosed illness. Mr. Johnson said Prince had received fluids during his visit.It is unclear what medications Prince was taking, but people close to him have said he suffered debilitating pain in his hips and elsewhere from decades of intense performances. Authorities have said they are investigating what role painkillers might have played in his death.The federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States attorneys office in Minneapolis have joined the inquiry.After postponing the April 7 show in Atlanta because he said he had the flu, he did a makeup performance the following week that observers described as electrifying. But Prince complained of stomach pains after the concert. And on his flight home, his private jet had to make an emergency landing in Moline, Ill., because he fell ill.His publicist said the emergency landing was a result of the flu. But emergency records showed that the pilot radioed that an unresponsive passenger was on board. Prince was carried off the plane by his bodyguard, the records said. Emergency medical personnel treated him with Narcan, which is typically administered to treat opioid overdoses, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the case. The official also said that Prince had powerful painkillers on him when he was found dead.Despite the medical scare, Prince was seen out and about afterward near his Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen, Minn., a suburb here. He hosted a party at the estate on the Saturday before his death. And two days before he was found, he was at a jazz club in Minneapolis taking in a show."}
{"text": "Drinking diet soda and other artificially sweetened beverages during pregnancy is associated with having overweight 1-year-olds, according to a new report.Canadian researchers studied 3,033 mothers who delivered healthy singletons between 2009 and 2012 and had completed diet questionnaires during their pregnancies. They then examined the babies when they were a year old. Almost 30 percent of the women drank artificially sweetened beverages during pregnancy.After controlling for maternal body mass index, age, breastfeeding duration, maternal smoking, maternal diabetes, timing of the introduction of solid foods and other factors, they found that compared with women who drank no diet beverages, those who drank, on average, one can of diet soda a day doubled the risk of having an overweight 1-year-old.The study, in JAMA Pediatrics, found no association with infant birth weight, suggesting that the effect is on postnatal, not fetal, growth. The mothers consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks was not associated with increased risk for overweight babies.This is an association, and not a causal link, said the lead author, Meghan B. Azad, an assistant professor at the University of Manitoba. But it certainly raises the question of whether artificial sweeteners are harmless. Its not time to ban them or tell everyone not to consume them, but theres no great benefit to consuming these drinks, so theres no harm in avoiding them."}
{"text": "The Fireman is only the fourth novel by Joe Hill. And two of the first three  the killer debut, Heart-Shaped Box (2007), and the whopping, immersive NOS4A2 (2013)  have felt like major events on the sheer strength of Mr. Hills imagination. Now hes written another big book, The Fireman, that reaffirms his gifts for riveting attention and pushing genre conventions to new extremes. This may be the first horror novel to turn its heroines singing (A Spoonful of Sugar) and quoting Mary Poppins (spit spot) into new ways to make the skin crawl.Mr. Hills acknowledgments thank a former agent who represented him for 10 years without knowing his real last name. He deserves not to have it mentioned in reviews of his books anymore, so look up his pedigree if you really need to. The only relevant references for Mr. Hill are now his own books, and the one The Fireman most resembles is NOS4A2. The Fireman is big. It creates an alluringly weird world. It has a highly developed code of honor, not to mention an ever-surprising lineup of surreal tricks its characters can pull. And it thrives on fear, but has hope at heart. Mr. Hill has a character allude to Cormac McCarthys idea of a post-apocalyptic world,  la The Road, and deems it gloomy. Mr. Hills books are anything but.What ravages our world this time around? A really good-looking plague that leaves victims with a pretty gold-and-black tattoo-like marking. Yes, its very lethal, and it causes victims to burst into flame. Its wiped out whole cities and a lot of important people. George Clooney died on a doomed mission to save New York City. President Obama? Up in smoke, too. Keith Richards is thought to have survived, on the theory that he can survive anything, but nobody knows for sure.Our heroine, the one who sometimes sings Helen Reddy when A Spoonful of Sugar wont do, is a 20-something nurse named Harper Grayson. Harper lives in New England, where people are terrified of death by Draco incendia trychophyton, which is known as Dragonscale for short. Harper is compassionate enough to treat infected patients, and one of her first is a mysterious Fireman who shows a telltale sign of illness: He gives off smoke. But the Fireman brings a boy for Harper to save. She then spends a tender night of lovemaking with her husband, Jakob, who turns into a raging beast when he decides Harper has infected both of them. A major plot point is born.A baby is conceived, too. And Harper spends the rest of the book determined to survive for that babys sake. But because the gold-and-black markings make it hard for the infected to hide, there are colonies of secret camps. And the book soon loses its global scale as it zeros in on one refugee zone.Mr. Hill stays so busy examining the ways different people react to mortal danger that Satan himself gets only a walk-on. (The devils tail  a slender 12-foot whip braided from fire  lashed behind him.) A cameo!And the communitys residents arent as interesting as the wild array of heroes and villains stalking NOS4A2, a book whose heroine and villain were indelible. Harper is a perfectly nice mother-to-be, the Fireman has done an amazing job of harnessing the power of flame, and each subplot has enough baggage to fill a 16-wheeler. But theres a rambling quality to The Fireman that was absent in Mr. Hills other, leaner books and really resembles that of  O.K., go look up his old man.The refuge into which Harper and the Fireman stumble seems to want to be all things to all people. At least it wants to be a microcosmic survey of human behavior. There are touchy-feely times, like when the group seems to want to buy the world a Coke: It turns out that singing and harmony can turn Dragonscale into a radiant, empowering thing. And there are times when the place feels more like the setting for a Salem witch trial. It is also problematically populated with characters who might as well have walked out of the childrens stories that Harper likes so much. The chief female villain has all the complexity of a Disney witch, although latter-day Disney witches have had better dialogue.But if Mr. Hills overarching plot has its problems, he remains a terrifically ingratiating writer when it comes to ambience and spirit. The books adults are somehow stuck in the 1980s, since panic has yanked them right back to childhood. The one place they are convinced is a safe haven is the Maine island refuge of Martha Quinn, the early, perky V.J. from MTV. For them, she lives on as an eternal beacon of youthful optimism.The Fireman is shot through with time-warp references like that, and they are the perfect comedic element to offset any sense of global doom. Mr. Hill takes his shots at hate-filled talk radio, at false piety, at lemming-like obedience to anyone who claims to be a leader. He also makes the Fireman a credible guy, not a superhero. When the Fireman first figures out that he can smolder and ignite at will, he doesnt feel like a comic-book character. He feels like a rock star. Writing graphic novels or comics runs in Mr. Hills family, too, but hes a chip off the old block in realizing that being a rock star is much better."}
{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon  A group of Lebanese professors, architects and filmmakers has fashioned an unlikely alternative to the bickering feudal political bosses who for decades have kept their country mired in stalemate. Its bid for power seemed quixotic at first.But it touched a nerve in Beiruts municipal elections this week, gaining unexpected traction with voters and fueling the upstarts conviction that it is possible to buck the Arab worlds trend toward authoritarianism.You cant just demonstrate and get tear-gassed, said Jad Chaaban, an economics professor at the American University of Beirut who helped hatch the technocratic political movement, called Beirut, My City. We need people like us in power.The partys members took on Lebanons political bosses in an election with high symbolic value but with little actual power at stake. The city government has a modest budget and limited influence over planning in the city, the countrys capital, but most authority rests with the national government, still securely under the control of the feudal establishment.Beirut residents voted on Sunday, but officials did not release results until Tuesday. Beirut, My City won about 40 percent of the vote, just a few points behind the establishment slate. Because there is no proportional representation, the winner takes all 24 seats on the council.Beirut, My City framed its shoestring campaign as part of a broader struggle to rid Lebanon of its corrupt leaders and show the Arab world how to change an established order without toppling into violence and chaos.Lebanons warlords ended a 15-year civil war in 1990 with a sectarian power-sharing agreement. Any faction can veto government decisions, and no single group can dominate the state.Despite their differences, groups as diverse as the Shiite group Hezbollah, the Sunni Future Movement and Christian warlords once allied with Israel support a system that allows them to divide the spoils of patronage without any oversight. Gerrymandering and rigid election laws make it almost impossible for independent political parties to challenge the sectarian factions at the national level. But municipal elections are, at least in theory, supposed to be nonsectarian, giving an opening to Beirut, My City.Establishment leaders followed an old formula to fend off the challenge, saying that without them and their power-sharing deals, everything could fall apart, plunging Lebanon back into civil war.This years municipal campaign starkly challenged that orthodoxy. Beirut, My City published a detailed platform focused on quality-of-life issues like traffic, garbage pickup and access to parks. The group refused help from any veteran politicians, and ran a slate of candidates evenly divided between men and women, Muslims and Christians.Saad Hariri, a former prime minister and a dominant Sunni politician, led an establishment campaign that warned ominously that unknown forces wanted to harm Beirut and break the parity among the citys sects. In a sign that the dominant leaders took the threat seriously, traditional rivals set aside their differences to run in a coalition against the upstarts called the Beirutis.Many Lebanese, even those angry about endemic corruption, fear that change could be destabilizing and feel compelled to vote for their sects traditional leaders.We dont trust anyone, but well vote for Hariri in order to show that we exist, said Ahmed Sharai, a store owner in the Sunni stronghold of Tarik Jadida, who said he moonlighted as a local militia chief.His poor and marginalized neighborhood has suffered from decades of institutional neglect, Mr. Sharai said. With the leaders we know, were still losing, he said. Imagine how much more we lose if theyre gone.His rationale neatly sums up how a system survives even though few profess to like it.Since 2011, Lebanon has emerged relatively unscathed from the types of crises that have led to war or dictatorship in nearby countries. The countrys bosses managed to keep their followers quiet during a series of bombings and assassinations, sectarian clashes and the arrival of more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees in a country with a population of about four million.But it is also clear that Lebanons recipe is not working. The country has been without a president for two years, and Parliament has unconstitutionally extended its term; the local elections this year are the only polls of any sort since 2010.Public anger reached a boiling point last summer, when the government failed to renew the nations waste collection contract amid allegations that Mr. Hariri was benefiting from a secret deal.As the garbage piled up, a movement called You Stink organized the biggest protests in Lebanon in a decade. Technocrats including Mr. Chaaban, the economics professor, grew frustrated when their proposals to address the garbage crisis were ignored, and they decided to go one step further and form a political party.Nine months later, rotting piles of uncollected waste spew clouds of gas that smell like vomit over the citys fanciest neighborhoods, while the politicians responsible for the debacle remain in office. But supporters of Beirut, My City believe they have begun something new and lasting.Theyre afraid of us! Elie Haddad, an engineer who helped the campaign, said with a laugh. Outside a polling place in West Beirut, he and other volunteers in white T-shirts distributed lists of the candidates for Beirut, My City. They were outnumbered almost 10 to one by volunteers for the well-funded Beirutis coalition, in red shirts and baseball caps, who displayed noticeably less zeal.Theres no such thing as a volunteer  were all paid to be here, said one of them, Abdelrahman Harb, 34, who was sitting in the shade of a rubber tree with his wife and some friends rather than canvassing voters for the establishment list.They can pay for us, but they cant make us vote for them, Mr. Harb said, slyly pulling a copy of the Beirut, My City list from his pocket. Were ready for a change.The civil campaigns goals are notably modest and are very much a product of Lebanons unusual political environment. The establishment that has run Beirut for the last 10 years faces newly energized scrutiny. Weve opened a Pandoras box, said Ibrahim Mneimneh, an engineer and the head candidate for Beirut, My City. We gave people a space to talk. People want to give a slap in the face to their sectarian leaders without taking a huge risk for the country.The campaign featured a rare shift from protest to hardball politics. The new party fleshed out detailed policies, and then tried, albeit with limited success, to build an electoral machine that reached the street and neighborhood level.Candidates directly attacked corrupt deals, many linked to Mr. Hariri, that have in recent years cut off public access to waterfront land and degraded the quality of water, power and other services in the capital. The civil campaign held forums in Beiruts few public spaces to call attention to their neglect and to a lack of green space.Parliamentary elections are expected within the next year, and many supporters of Beirut, My City want to expand the party nationwide.They are well organized, and they have content, said Ziad Baroud, an influential critic of government policy who served as Lebanons interior minister from 2008 to 2011. The group delivered a clear message to the establishment, he said: You failed; you didnt do much. We have policies; we have a program.They are into politics, he said of Beirut, My City. Thats why they made it."}
{"text": "For months during the Democratic presidential nominating contest, Hillary Clinton has resisted calls from Senator Bernie Sanders to back a single-payer health system, arguing that the fight for government-run health care was a wrenching legislative battle that had already been lost.But as she tries to clinch the nomination, Mrs. Clinton is moving to the left on health care and this week took a significant step in her opponents direction, suggesting she would like to give people the option to buy into Medicare.Im also in favor of whats called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age, Mrs. Clinton said on Monday at a campaign event in Virginia.Mr. Sanders calls his single-payer health care plan Medicare for all. What Mrs. Clinton proposed was a sort of Medicare for more.The Medicare program covers Americans once they reach 65. Beneficiaries pay premiums to help cover the cost of their coverage, but the government pays the bulk of the bill. Mrs. Clintons suggestion was that perhaps younger Americans, people 55 or 50 and up, could voluntarily pay to join the program.She made the remarks as she continues to face a determined challenge on the left from Mr. Sanders, forcing her to essentially fight a two-front war as she seeks to turn her attention to Donald J. Trump and the general election. While Mr. Sanders trails by a substantial number of delegates, his effect continues to be felt in the race as he pressures Mrs. Clinton to adopt more progressive positions.Bernie Sanderss campaign is having an effect on Hillary Clintons policies, said Steve McMahon, a Democratic political consultant from Purple Strategies. From a progressive point of view, thats exactly what was hoped for and that is exactly what is happening.The idea of allowing people to buy in to Medicare has been discussed in policy circles and in Congress for decades. Mrs. Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, floated a similar proposal in 1998, including it in his  State of the Union address that year. The strategy has been embraced by many advocates of single-payer health care as a way to move more Americans into the existing government system. An incremental expansion of Medicare was the hoped-for strategy of Medicares original authors.But it is a new idea in Mrs. Clintons presidential campaign. She has called for a range of health policy overhauls  to preserve and expand the Affordable Care Act. She has proposed expanding financial protections for people with high health care costs and expanding subsidies to help middle-income people buy their own insurance. She also has proposed a package of policies to lower the price of prescription drugs.But more recently, she has moved further. In February, she began discussing the possibility of a public option, a government-run insurance plan available to people shopping on the existing marketplaces. That idea was considered when the Affordable Care Act was being debated in Congress, but it was ultimately removed from the law.Mrs. Clintons latest suggestion regarding Medicare, first reported by Bloomberg News, takes another step by proposing that Americans still in their prime working years be given the opportunity to obtain the same government insurance that is provided on a universal basis to their older peers.The politics in the short term are good, said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Medicare is a popular program  people dont know too much about health reform, but people know about Medicare.Before the Affordable Care Act, people older than 55 tended to have difficulty buying their own insurance, because insurance companies saw them as bigger risks. Since the health law passed, insurance plans have been banned from discriminating against people based on health history, but they can charge premiums that are three times as much as younger adults are charged.Moving more older adults into the Medicare program could have the effect of lowering insurance costs for younger people, as Mrs. Clinton suggested. But the exact dynamics would depend on how the program was structured.Mrs. Clinton did not say, for example, whether lower-income Americans choosing Medicare would receive help paying their premiums, as they do when they buy private plans on the new marketplaces in the Affordable Care Act. Without such subsidies, Medicare might be an affordable option only for wealthy or very sick customers. In 2008, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a Medicare buy-in program for 62- to 64-year-olds would cost about $7,600 a person.Medicare tends to cover a wider range of doctors and services than commercial plans, but it also has more holes  it has no limit on how much patients can be asked to spend out of their own pockets, for example. That means conventional Medicare would have different benefits and financial protections than private plans that are available to the 50-to-65 population.Its not a bad concept to be playing with and thinking about, said Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning policy research group. But there are some complexities that need to be ironed out.Taking a more progressive stance on health care could serve Mrs. Clinton in a general election matchup against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. He has offered a range of views on the subject. While he says that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he also has called for a system that would ensure that all Americans have health coverage.Mr. Sanders is pressing on in his campaign and hopes to influence the partys platform at the July convention even if, as expected, he does not become the nominee. He has already pulled Mrs. Clinton to take more progressive stances on several issues, including supporting a higher minimum wage and opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Keystone XL pipeline.Although Mr. Sanders viewed Mrs. Clintons latest health care proposal as progress, he said on Tuesday that it was not sufficient.Secretary Clintons proposal to let the American people buy into Medicare is a step in the right direction, but just like her support for a $12 minimum wage, it is not good enough, Mr. Sanders said in a statement that described her idea as Medicare for some."}
{"text": "In the 2012 drama Neighboring Sounds, the Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonca Filho dissected the class tensions of a single street in Recife. Dazzlingly shot and edited, the debut feature was chosen as Brazils submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. Its whisker-sensitive feel for the tensions in daily lives, and the centuries of history that lie beneath, seemed to take the pulse of Brazilian society.Four years later, Mr. Mendonca Filho will present his new feature, Aquarius, in competition at the Cannes International Film Festival. The selection comes as Brazil struggles with a real-life political crisis to rival anything cooked up on film: a deeply divisive attempt to impeach its populist president, Dilma Rousseff.What is going on now is a coup dtat, albeit a very modern and cynical one, Mr. Mendonca Filho, a former film critic, said via email, while putting the finishing touches on the sound mix for Aquarius.Aquarius, filmed last August and September, before the current phase of the political crisis started, touches on urban development and the attendant possibilities of municipal corruption, and seems to speak to the bigger picture of power politics and malfeasance in Brazil.Sonia Braga plays a retired music journalist, Clara, who feuds with developers intent on tearing down her building. (Aquarius is the buildings name.) Shot on location, the film has a cast of more than 50 characters, including nonprofessionals. Mr. Mendonca Filho said he found a special satisfaction in portraying Claras sensitive state of mind and a sense of traveling through time.Time traveling is something that fascinates me, especially because as you grow older, you realize traveling through time is a strange, sad and sometimes very happy truth about living your life, Mr. Mendonca Filho said. He added that in Aquarius hed used very classic tools of filmmaking to present my own vision of ripples in time.The time-fluid role seems a suitable match for Ms. Braga, 65, a storied face on Brazilian screens big and small. She starred in Bruno Barretos popular Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands (1976) and Hector Babencos Academy Award nominee Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985), as well as appearing in two popular telenovelas, Gabriela and Dancin Days, in the 1970s.Ms. Braga said Aquarius would be her first trip to Cannes since visiting for the 25th anniversary revival of Kiss of the Spiderwoman in Cannes Classics. She became a fan of Mr. Mendonca Filho after seeing Neighboring Sounds, which had a successful outing for an independent film at the Brazilian box office.That movie has this timing, a way of telling a story I havent seen before, Ms. Braga said in an effusive phone interview. Kleber really is unique in his way of showing images, besides being an encyclopedia of movies.Mr. Mendonca Filho, who hails from a younger generation, said casting Ms. Braga lent a certain weight to his film. She was, as he put it, a part of my life before they ever worked together.Besides her history, Sonia of course has a very strong screen presence  a wonderful actress and a film star in the classic sense, he said. It was great to work with such a screen persona in the decidedly smaller scale of my own films.Mr. Mendonca Filho made a number of shorts before his two features, dating back to 2002s The Little Cotton Girl. Before that, he shot various works on video but quit because of the low quality. There followed a lengthy stint as a film critic (including trips to Cannes). He has also worked as a film programmer at the Joaquim Nabuco Foundation in Pernambuco, a city that federal and local financing has helped turn into a center for independent-minded cinema, away from the more commercial production of So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.Pernambuco also provided a vivid backdrop for Mr. Mendonca Filho, who prides himself on grounding his features in the precise feel and detail of urban spaces. Neighboring Sounds was set in his own neighborhood, shot with wide angles; Claras building is in an upper-class seaside quarter known as Boa Viagem Avenue.To me the film is about a city, a building and the woman that lives in it, Ms. Braga said. That is the simplicity of this story.Her character, Clara, is widowed with three grown children, but despite the suggestions of friends and family, vows to remain in her two-story building  where she is the sole remaining resident  until her death.Mr. Mendonca Filho was asked if the premise of Aquarius anticipated something about the current moment in Brazilian politics.Despite his own fervent feelings about his countrys young democracy, Mr. Mendonca Filho said he was intent on giving viewers a chance to process Aquarius for themselves.Good films or books pick up on things in society, or in a country, but it is too early to say if this film does that before the film actually screens and people react to it, he said. Only then will I know. I am curious myself."}
{"text": "During strolls along its quiet, tree-lined boulevards, there is a decidedly intimate, rustic feel that pervades Kobe, Japan, despite its population of nearly 1.5 million. But there is also a distinctly cosmopolitan air  one that comes partly from its history as one of the first cities to be forced to open trade following Japans centuries-long policy of sakoku, or isolation from the rest of the world, until the mid-19th century.The result is a city that is a fascinating mix of both tradition and adopted customs, a mostly seamless amalgam of different cultures. I visited sake breweries dating back to the 1700s; that same night, I watched a jazz trio burn through standards at a swank Kobe club. I relaxed with locals at a Japanese onsen, or hot spring, on a hilltop on a nearby island, Awaji. I also went on a walking tour of Kitano-cho, a neighborhood that contains foreign residences like the Weathercock house, a red brick structure with an Art Nouveau interior that feels as though it wouldnt look out of place in the hills of Bavaria. And, naturally, I went in search of a thrifty way to enjoy Kobe beef, the expensive and much sought-after product of Tajima cattle raised in Hyogo prefecture, where Kobe lies.Kobe is a long city, positioned on the coast between mountains, to the north, and Osaka Bay to the south. (Kobe is just 40 minutes from Osaka by train; you can read more about Osakas great food here.) I exited the train at the Hyogo station on the JR Tokaido-Sanyo line (using my same Suica card I purchased when I was in Tokyo; see more details about train logistics in Japan in my Tokyo article) and made the short walk to the Kobe Luminous Hotel, where Id found a room for $79 per night on Hotels.com. It wasnt grand or inspired by any means, but my single was clean and sufficient for the solo traveler.Best of all, I was only a few stops  less than 10 minutes  from Kobe-Sannomiya station, in the heart of downtown. I was in the mood for some of the above-mentioned Kobe beef one afternoon, and so I strategically targeted the lunch hour. As any good bargain hunter knows, lunch is when many expensive restaurants offer deals, serving similar (or exactly the same) meals as during dinnertime, but for a fraction of the price. I ducked into a small street and looked at the lunch menu for a restaurant called Ishida. The Kobe beef lunch options there ranged from 3,300 to 8,800 yen (about $31.40 to $83.85)  a bit more than I was looking to pay. I went around the corner and found one of a small restaurant chain called Nishimuraya, which had a menu more in my price range: 1,980 yen for a serving of Kobe beef, rice, soup, salad and pickles.The restaurant had no English signage outside, and I discovered it purely by accident. I slid open the outside door and headed up a quiet, narrow staircase. Everything was done in wood and there was some music playing I had originally noticed; I could pick out a few notes here and there from the melody of a jazz song. I entered and was greeted by the host and the chef, who was in the back, and was shown to a table booth with a large charcoal burner in the middle. I ordered my lunch, and a man with a pan of glowing hot charcoal fed the burner on my table, then placed a metal grate on the top.The beef came out quickly, as did the accompaniments (the mushroom and tofu soup was outstanding). I took the small slices, reddish-pink and streaked with white fat, and placed them on the grill. The fat sizzled, droplets hitting the coal, and each piece quickly turned a beautiful shade of brown. Per my servers suggestion, I dressed each piece with only a small amount of a salt-and-pepper mixture that was on the table. The taste of the beef was sensational: each piece was a flavor bomb of protein and fat. The simple salt dressing was a perfect complement, highlighting the sweetness of the fat but not obscuring the taste of the beef.Working off the beef would prove easy enough: Kobe is a delightful and interesting place to walk around. I followed a suggestion that came from a follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account and went in search of the Kobe Mosque, opened in 1935, the first mosque in Japan. When I saw two minarets peeking out from some pink cherry blossoms, I knew I had arrived. I removed my shoes and went inside. An elderly man greeted me and offered me a date, which I took. There werent any worshipers when I was there, but I went inside the musalla (prayer hall) for a few minutes before looking at some old pictures that illustrated the history of the mosque, including how it survived Allied bombings during World War II.From the mosque it was an easy and meandering walk toward the mountains and up through Kitano-cho, or foreign residence neighborhood. You can wind up passing through some quiet streets and alleys and glimpse old houses, built in a European style, which used to house merchants and foreign residents of Japan. There are roughly 20 houses that can be toured  you may not want to see all of them, but its an interesting bit of history. Two particularly notable houses are the Weathercock house, built in 1909 and the Moegi house, built in 1903. You can purchase tickets to tour each house individually for 350 yen; I bought a dual ticket for 650 yen that allowed me to walk through both Weathercock and Moegi.At the nearby tourist information center, I had a nice, if slightly labored conversation (due to my lack of Japanese) with some lovely old women who worked there. They patiently recommended that I visit one of Kobes onsen. I set out late one afternoon in search of one Id randomly decided on based on poring over the area Google Maps.I began the journey at the foot of the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, a massive piece of construction that has the longest central span of any suspension bridge in the world. From Maiko station (about 20 minutes west of downtown Kobe), its a separate 410-yen bus ride across the bridge to Awaji Island. The bus is not the easiest thing to find  it requires walking up four or five flights of stairs and meeting the bus directly on the bridge itself. I asked a local woman for help (a good habit if you dont read Japanese) and was led to the correct bus.From where I exited the bus to my destination seemed a reasonable 18-minute walk. There was just one problem: I couldnt find it. I looked and looked; I asked around, hunted for signs, but there was nothing. Finally, as it was getting dark, I imposed upon a group of university students who were studying in a nearby building. They informed me that my destination was, in fact, another 3 kilometers away. So I started walking. I did it so you dont have to, but my recommendation is: Dont make that walk. Its dangerous. Call a taxi, if possible. There are too many areas with no sidewalk and at night, its a bad idea.I did make it to my onsen, though, and once there, managed to let my ire toward the bad maps experience melt away as I looked out over Akashi Strait from an outdoor bubbling pool of soothing hot water. Admission to the springs is 700 yen; a very thin towel costs 200 yen, and youll need additional 100-yen coins to use as deposits for the lockers. There are separate male and female sides  once youre in your section, check any Puritanism you may have at the door and be prepared to hang out with a large number of naked people. Relaxing in the outdoor pool, while looking out over the mammoth bridge Id crossed a couple of hours before, was one of the best moments of the trip.But it wasnt the only good moment. I spent one afternoon walking around the Nada district, one of the top sake-producing areas of the country. Its said by many in Japan that Kobe is a perfect place to brew sake, with the availability of quality rice, a good water supply, conducive weather and proximity to the harbor for exporting. I took the train to Mikage station and walked to the Hakutsuru Brewery Museum. Over two levels, the sake-making process from centuries past is illustrated, from rice preparation to fermentation to storage in giant wooden casks. I then made the brief walk  about 15 minutes  to another brewery/museum called Shu-Shin-Kan. They have a full-on sake bar at Shu-Shin-Kan, and I got a very nice (and free) sake tasting from one of the employees. One sake I tried, Daiginjo, tasted smooth, clean and floral. Another, called Junmai-shu, was subtle and mellow.Drinking always goes better with music, however, and I remedied that with a visit to the legendary Sone jazz club. Established in 1969 and considered by some to be the birthplace of the Japanese jazz scene, Sone is all wood, polished brass, whiskey and sharply dressed waiters. The place emanates cool, the way a jazz club should. When I went in, the jazz trio was midway through their set. I paid the 1,140-yen cover, took a seat alone at a table, and ordered a beer for 790 yen. After a few songs, a singer, Junko Koyanagi, joined the trio and made some introductions in Japanese. Then, as if someone flipped a switch, she began singing jazz standards in perfect English. Just squeeze me, but please dont tease me, she crooned over the trio, belting the 1941 Duke Ellington classic. She went through a few other standards, including a flawless Route 66  no mean feat, as Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino doesnt exactly roll off the tongue.The set ended  far too soon  and the group took their bows. Its often said that music has no language or, rather, that it is its own language. That proved to be true that evening in Kobe, as I was reminded that even halfway across the world, its possible to feel entirely at home."}
{"text": "Of all the lovely moments in a recital by the soprano Ying Fang on Monday evening at Alice Tully Hall, her two encores were particularly memorable. An exquisitely sung aria from Handels Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno showcased the purity of her voice to poignant effect, as did the Shepherds song from Wagners Tannhuser.Ms. Fang, a member of the Metropolitan Operas Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, dedicated the Wagner selection to James Levine, who led his final performance as the Mets music director on Saturday. (He conducted her as the Shepherd in Tannhuser in the fall.) The Juilliard School, where Ms. Fang studied, presented the concert, in which she was deftly accompanied by the veteran collaborative pianist Brian Zeger.Not all of the works on the program were rendered as expressively as the encores. But its rare to hear a young singer with such a uniformly beautiful sound and such solid technique in repertory that includes the Baroque and Chinese folk song.Three elegantly ornamented Handel arias that opened the program (including Endless Pleasure, from Semele) were a vehicle for Ms. Fangs clean coloratura. She conveyed the intimacy of Auch kleine Dinge, which opened a set of six songs chosen from Wolfs Italian Songbook, and the turmoil of Mir ward gesagt. Her eloquent musicianship was complemented by her poise, with subtle, balletic arm and hand movements gently illustrating the text.Ms. Fang, a native of Ningbo, China, provided English translations for three of the four Chinese songs on the program. The highlight was her poetic delivery of the atmospheric At Night Mooring by the Maple Bridge, a melismatic, gently dissonant song by Li Yinghai (1927-2007).Her voice warmed in three songs by Bizet, including Ouvre ton coeur, whose bolero rhythms seem to foreshadow his opera Carmen. Ms. Fang was alluring throughout her range, the high notes delivered with soaring ease. She also demonstrated her linguistic facility, concluding the second half of the program with thoughtful, passionately rendered interpretations of Rachmaninoffs Six Songs (Op. 38).There were a lot of empty seats on Monday. But Ms. Fangs blooming artistry will surely soon attract new fans."}
{"text": "The pharmaceuticals merger mind-set may be changing. Allergan, the $87 billion maker of Botox, will devote capital to stock buybacks and paying down debt.Separately, Bill Ackmans hedge fund is selling a big part of his stake in Zoetis, the animal health company that he considered a takeover target. With luck, the two moves together signal a more subdued approach to deals.Allergan spent the last few years on an acquisition spree powered by borrowing. The decision to sell its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5 billion when drug stocks were peaking in July 2015, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rest of the business to Pfizer in November, indicated that Brent Saunders, the chief of Allergan, had a keen sense of how the merger and acquisition winds were blowing.With the Pfizer deal thwarted by Treasury officials last month, Allergan is reimagining itself without acquisitions as a primary strategy. There will be small deals, and Mr. Saunders isnt categorically ruling out larger ones. Even so, he says there is no greater investment than Allergan stock, suggesting a less merger-and-acquisitions-focused approach. Allergan plans to buy back up to $10 billion in shares, shrink its debt load and fund research and development.Mr. Ackmans reported $800 million sale of Zoetis shares also suggests a cooler deal market. After a bad run, led by his soured bet on another once-acquisitive pharmaceuticals company, Valeant, his Pershing Square could be in need of extra liquidity, or there may simply be better opportunities. The investment in 2014, however, was largely based on the idea that Zoetis would be bought.After Zoetis was spun off from Pfizer, Mr. Ackmans fund installed a board director and called the company a scarce asset, essentially hanging out a for-sale sign. Shrinking his funds position implies that a sale may be less likely as buyers like Valeant head for the sidelines.Health care mergers and acquisitions have accelerated out of control. A record volume of deals were announced last year even after stripping out the $160 billion union of Pfizer and Allergan. Tax benefits overshadowed strategic sense. Valuations and premiums soared. Regulators then got worried. If the pace is indeed slowing, as Tuesdays news implies, it could be an encouraging sign of a renewed commitment to developing drugs instead of just overpaying for them."}
{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea  When the North Korean state news media on Tuesday published lists of officials newly selected for senior posts, at least one name came as a surprise: Ri Yong-gil, a prominent general.In February, South Korean officials said General Ri had been executed on corruption charges. But according to the North Korean reports Tuesday, he is not only alive but a member of the Central Committee of the Norths ruling Workers Party, as well as its Central Military Commission.The appointments were made during the Workers Party congress that ended Monday, the first such gathering in 36 years. General Ri was also named an alternate member of the Politburo, according to the reports Tuesday.General Ri had been chief of the North Korean Armys general staff, the third-ranking figure in the armys hierarchy, when his name abruptly stopped appearing in state media reports in January. In February, South Korean intelligence officials said General Ri had been executed, apparently the latest senior official to fall in a series of purges and executions that the Norths top leader, Kim Jong-un, has used to consolidate power.Because North Korea rarely publicizes the executions of top officials, most such reports cannot be independently confirmed. And doubts about General Ris supposed execution emerged in the weeks that followed. In March, a South Korean cable channel, MBN, reported that General Ri had been demoted, not executed, and that he had been allowed to return to service.Pictures released Tuesday by the North Korean state news media seemed to support that theory. General Ri was shown wearing a three-star rather than a four-star insignia, indicating he had been reduced in rank.South Korean intelligence officials say it is extremely difficult to get reliable information about developments within the Norths opaque government. Officials have disappeared from public view for months at a time, only to resurface later. Early last year, South Korean officials told reporters that Ma Won-chun, a senior general who was in charge of the renovation of the Pyongyang airport, had been purged. But General Ma, it appears, was simply demoted, and he resurfaced later in the year.On Tuesday, North Korea organized a rally of hundreds of thousands of people in central Pyongyang to mark the end of the party congress. Mr. Kim, accompanied by his newly appointed senior aides, oversaw the rally, which featured parades and slogans of loyalty to his leadership, according to the state news media."}
{"text": "At the turn of the 20th century, when Claude Debussy sat down to write his haunting piano piece Clair de Lune, he had before him little more than pen, paper and piano.Toward the end of the century, when Isao Tomita sat down to record the piece, he had before him a thicket that included a Moog synthesizer, comprising (among many other things) a 914 extended range fixed filter bank, two 904-A voltage-controlled low-pass filters, nine 901-B oscillators, four 911 envelope generators, five 902 voltage-controlled amplifiers, a 950 keyboard controller and a 6401 Bode ring modulator; several tape recorders, among them an Ampex MM-1100 16-track and a Sony TC-9040 4-track; two Sony MX-16 mixers; an AKG BX20E Echo unit; an Eventide Clockworks Instant Phaser; two Binson Echorec 2 units; and the electronic keyboard instrument known as a Mellotron.Released by RCA in 1974, the resulting recording, Snowflakes Are Dancing, brought Mr. Tomita  who died on May 5, at 84, and was widely considered the father of Japanese electronic music  international renown. Nominated for a Grammy Award for best classical album, the record, containing Mr. Tomitas renditions of a string of Debussy pieces, sold hundreds of thousands of copies, an almost unheard-of feat for a disc at least nominally rooted in the classical world.It also divided that world, much as the album that inspired it, Switched-On Bach, by Walter (now Wendy) Carlos, had done on its release in 1968.Some critics commended Mr. Tomita for the exhilarating glee of his music, as The San Francisco Chronicle wrote in 2000, reviewing a rerelease of Snowflakes Are Dancing.Others huffed and puffed. In 1975, discussing the release that year of Mr. Tomitas rendition of Mussorgskys most famous work, Jack Hiemenz wrote in The New York Times:Tomitas electronic transformation of Pictures at an Exhibition, like the job he did on Debussy, will disappoint the more musically minded, though it will just as certainly titillate the quad nuts. Its another four-ring circus, announcing its intent at the outset by having each note of the striding Promenade theme issue coyly from a different speaker  a kind of four-point instant antiphony that may well give a listener vertigo.Undaunted by reviews, Mr. Tomita continued his work, which was reported to have influenced musicians around the world, among them Stevie Wonder and the Japanese techno-pop group Yellow Magic Orchestra.His success was all the more noteworthy in that he had had to come to terms on his own with the inscrutable behemoth that was his chosen instrument.Isao Tomita was born in Tokyo on April 22, 1932. He spent part of his childhood in China, where his father, Kiyoshi, was a physician at a textile mill; the family returned to Japan in 1939.After World War II ended, the young Mr. Tomita became enraptured by Western classical music, along with jazz and pop, through radio broadcasts by the United States Army of occupation.I thought I was listening to music from outer space, he told the English-language Japanese magazine Tokyo Weekender in 2013. When I was a child, Japan was closed to Western music.As a student at Keio University in Tokyo, where he studied literature, he took private lessons in piano, music theory and Western compositional technique.He began his career as a composer for Japanese films and television; his credits include the television cartoon known in English as Kimba the White Lion.In the late 1960s, he encountered Switched-On Bach. Where that album offered a note-for-note recreation of Bachs music on a Moog synthesizer, Mr. Tomita was determined to use the instrument to augment classical pieces far beyond the composers original intent.For the first 20 years of my career, I was looking for some new instrument  there have been no new instruments since Wagner, Mr. Tomita told The Los Angeles Times in 1999. Then I discovered the synthesizer, and with that I could create by myself the sounds I wanted to have.He scoured the world for one  he could find none in Japan  and in the early 1970s imported a Moog from the United States. Then his troubles began.At Customs, they asked me what this machine was, he recalled in an interview with the online music magazine Resident Advisor. I told them that it was an instrument, and they didnt believe me. They said, Then, play it. Mr. Tomita continued:I wish it was that easy, but it takes a while to even generate something thats not just noise, so I couldnt play it in front of them. I pulled out an LP of Switched-On Bach, which has a Moog on the cover, and they still didnt buy it. Eventually I had to ask Moog to send over a photo that shows somebody using a Moog synthesizer onstage.Then there was the daunting nature of the machine itself.It was hell, he said in the same interview. I felt like I just paid loads of money for a big chunk of metal. If I cant make proper sounds, its just junk!Also, since Moog was a new kind of instrument, I didnt have a clue how it was supposed to sound because there wasnt anything to compare it to. So I started emulating existing sounds, such as a bell or a whistle, and went from there.Mr. Tomitas other recordings include electronic interpretations of Stravinskys Firebird Suite and Holsts The Planets, both released in 1976, and of Ravels Bolero, released in 1980.In later years, he staged live multimedia performances that he called sound clouds in cities including New York and Sydney, Australia.Mr. Tomitas death, in Tokyo, was confirmed by his family. His survivors include his wife, Akiko; a daughter, Rie Seno; a son, Masaru; a sister, Shizue Maruyama; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.Among his best-known recent works was Symphony Ihatov, given its world premiere in Tokyo in 2012, with the composer leading the Japan Philharmonic and an accompanying choir.The symphonys featured soloist was the synthesized diva Hatsune Miku, a singing digital avatar created by the Japanese company Crypton Future Media, who sang and danced Mr. Tomitas score.In interviews, Mr. Tomita expressed his gratitude at being able to write for Miku, as she is familiarly known, a cyber-celebrity whose singing was by then garnering millions of views on YouTube.I had no idea that she was so popular, he told Tokyo Weekender. So I was very pleased that she agreed to work with me."}

He has been a head coach for 1,151 N.H.L. games, a total that ranks 16th in league history, over 15 seasons with Quebec/Colorado, Vancouver, Los Angeles and Dallas.He was coach of the year with Quebec in 1995 and won the Stanley Cup in 1996 after the Nordiques moved to Denver and became the Avalanche.Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals was suspended for one game and fined by Major League Baseball for his behavior after an ejection this week.The commissioners office said Harper had decided to appeal the penalty, so he remained eligible to play until the process was finished. Harper, last years National League most valuable player, was in the Nationals lineup Wednesday night against the Detroit Tigers.On Monday night, during the bottom of the ninth inning of Washingtons 5-4 victory over Detroit, Harper was in the dugout when he was ejected by the plate umpire, Brian Knight, after the Nationals Danny Espinosa was called out on strikes.When someone is tossed from a game in the majors, he is required to leave the dugout.Moments after the ejection, pinch-hitter Clint Robinson connected for a game-winning home run, and Harper ran onto the field with his teammates to celebrate. Harper pointed toward Knight and cursed at him.Eight-Game Streak Ends for Cubs Brett Wallace hit a three-run homer in San Diegos four-run seventh inning, and the visiting Padres stopped the Chicago Cubs eight-game winning streak with a 7-4 victory in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.Wil Myers had two hits and scored two runs for San Diego, which had lost three in a row. Carlos Villanueva (1-0) pitched a scoreless inning for the win, and Fernando Rodney got three outs for his ninth save.Sunderland completed its latest escape from relegation in the English Premier League on Wednesday  and consigned Newcastle, its bitter nearby rival, to the second tier in the process.A 3-0 win over visiting Everton guaranteed Sunderland safety with a game to spare and justified its decision to hire the survival specialist Sam Allardyce as manager in October.Under Allardyce, who has yet to be relegated from the top English league in 25 years as a manager, Sunderland lost just one of its final 10 matches.Its pretty miraculous, Allardyce said.Newcastle and Norwich joined Aston Villa in going down just as the Premier League was to begin new domestic and international television deals worth a record $12 billion over the next three years.Norwichs 4-2 victory over Watford proved to be in vain, as Sunderland stayed 4 points ahead.Roger Federer put his full array of shots on display in a 6-3, 7-5 win over Alexander Zverev in the second round of the Italian Open in Rome, an encouraging performance given that he had decided to play only moments before stepping onto the court.I was expecting to lose in straight sets today, said Federer, who has been having back problems. That was the mind-set going in, so to win in straights is actually a really big surprise to me. I played cautious, and I only decided after the warm-up that I was actually going to play.Top-ranked Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal, a seven-time champion in Rome, also advanced in straight sets on the red clay courts at the Foro Italico.In womens action, Angelique Kerber, the reigning Australian Open champion; fourth-seeded Victoria Azarenka; and Simona Halep, last weeks Madrid Open winner, each lost.Djokovic, seeking his third straight title in Rome, beat Stphane Robert, 7-5, 7-5. Nadal defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber, 6-3, 6-3, and Murray beat Mikhail Kukushkin, 6-3, 6-3.Eugenie Bouchard, the 2014 Wimbledon runner-up, beat the second-seeded Kerber, 6-1, 5-7, 7-5, and Irina-Camelia Begu, ranked 35th, defeated Azarenka, 6-3, 6-2.

{"text": "Late last year, in what seemed a David-and-Goliath case for the concert industry, a ticketing start-up filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Ticketmaster, saying it was abusing its market power over the lucrative niche of ticket sales for musicians fan clubs.The case, filed in December by Songkick, provided a glimpse into the highly competitive world of artist presale tickets, which has become a point of contention as touring musicians seek to maximize their earning potential.But on Wednesday, a judge denied the injunction and largely sided with Ticketmaster, which argued that its contracts with concert halls allow it to determine how tickets are allotted.Ticketmaster allows artists to sell a portion  typically 8 to 10 percent  of the tickets to their concerts through fan clubs, and competes with Songkick and other companies to handle those sales. But Ticketmaster also argues that its contracts allow it to determine what is a legitimate fan club; a number of such cases are in dispute in the Songkick suit.In March, Songkick asked the judge for a temporary injunction against Ticketmaster, saying that the company had been retaliating against Songkicks clients. When Songkick handled a presale, it said, Ticketmaster demanded that it pay the fees that Ticketmaster would otherwise have made from selling those tickets. Those actions, Songkick argued, would drive Songkick out of the artist presale ticketing business in the U.S.Judge Dale S. Fischer of United States District Court in Los Angeles rejected Songkicks request, saying that the companys argument failed to show virtually any likelihood of success on its merits.The case may still go to trial, but the judges decision suggests that Songkick has so far failed to make a persuasive antitrust argument.While the exclusive contracts are at issue in the lawsuit, the judge wrote, the current motion makes no serious attempt to demonstrate that these contracts, in and of themselves, violate antitrust law.Ticketmaster, a division of Live Nation Entertainment, is by far the giant of the ticketing world, selling $25 billion worth of tickets last year, according to company filings.Last week, Ticketmaster filed a countersuit, saying Songkick was interfering in its business. Ticketmaster argues that it wins exclusive rights to sell tickets for concert venues by bidding against competitors, and that those contracts give it control over how tickets are sold, including through presales handled by other vendors.In a statement, Jared Smith, the president of Ticketmaster North America, said that the ruling confirms that Ticketmasters exclusive rights agreements mean what they say, and that Ticketmaster is entitled to protect itself from third-party ticketing companies exploiting our voluntary program for artist fan club presales.Songkick said it was disappointed by the ruling but was still pursuing its remaining claims in the suit, which include conspiracy and unfair competition.Songkick will continue with its legal case and remains committed to providing artists with an alternative that puts tickets in the hands of fans at a lower cost and helps keep them out of the hands of scalpers, the company said in a statement.In a separate order, the judge dismissed a claim in Songkicks lawsuit that had challenged Ticketmasters merger with Live Nation, completed in 2010, on antitrust grounds."}
{"text": "The Kenyan government has announced that it plans to expel hundreds of thousands of refugees, a move that aid agencies say would violate international law and endanger many people.For years, Kenya has threatened to shut down the Dadaab refugee camp, where hundreds of thousands of Somalis have been marooned for decades. A sea of tents and plastic shelters spread out across miles of desert near the border with Somalia, the camp has become essentially one of Kenyas largest cities.On Wednesday, the Kenyan government said that terrorists were using Dadaab as a hide-out.As a country we have been glad to help our neighbors and all those in need sometimes at the expense of our security, the government said in a statement. But there comes a time when we must think primarily about the security of our people. Ladies and gentlemen, that time is now.Kenya is home to about half a million refugees who have fled years of war and turmoil in neighboring Somalia. But Somalia is hardly at peace now; the Shabab militant group continues to rule large parts of the country, brutalizing and killing civilians.Human rights organizations said international and Kenyan law prohibited the forced return of refugees to any place where they might face persecution or other serious harm.The threat posed by the Shabab in Somalia and Kenya is real, but that doesnt negate Kenyas obligation to abide by international refugee law, Bill Frelick, the refugee rights program director at Human Rights Watch, said last week in a statement. In a single breath, the Kenyan government recognizes that the Somalis it has been hosting for nearly 25 years are still refugees, but then states its finished with them.The government has not set a deadline for expelling refugees, saying only that it will do so in the shortest time possible.Some analysts suspect that the refugees are becoming victims of Kenyan politics. Kenya is scheduled to hold a presidential election next year, and the incumbent, Uhuru Kenyatta, has been positioning himself as the best candidate to protect national security."}
{"text": "It is a rarer feat than a perfect game, a performance even the greatest strikeout pitcher in major league history, Nolan Ryan, could never achieve. On Wednesday night, Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals struck out 20 batters in a nine-inning start.Scherzer overwhelmed the Detroit Tigers in a 3-2 victory at Nationals Park. He tied the record set by Roger Clemens in 1986 and later matched by Clemens in 1996, Kerry Wood in 1998 and Randy Johnson  in the first nine innings of an extra-inning game  in 2001.Just as in those games, Scherzer issued no walks in his masterpiece. He threw 119 pitches and allowed six hits and two runs, one coming on a homer by J. D. Martinez to start the ninth inning. Scherzer struck out Miguel Cabrera, allowed a single and then fanned Justin Upton to tie the mark.One out remained, giving Scherzer a chance to hold the record on his own. But James McCann bounced to third base for a game-ending forceout at second.I think it was about the eighth inning when I punched out somebody and they said that was 18  that was the first time I heard the number, so I knew I had a shot at going out for the ninth and 20, Scherzer told reporters after the game.A different Washington pitcher, Tom Cheney of the old Senators, holds the single-game record for strikeouts, with 21, set on Sept. 12, 1962, in Baltimore. But Cheney, who went 19-29 in an otherwise uneventful career, needed 16 innings to do it.Ryan, the career strikeout leader with 5,714, had four games with 19 strikeouts  three in 1974 and one in 1977. But he pitched more than nine innings in three of those games.Scherzer joined Washington before last season, signing a seven-year, $210 million contract after seven strong seasons, mostly with the Tigers. He won a Cy Young Award for Detroit but had completed only one of his 198 career starts.Now, at 31, Scherzer is more durable than ever, and his highlights are more remarkable, including two no-hitters last season. In his first, on June 20, he nearly authored the 24th perfect game in major league history, before losing his bid by hitting Pittsburghs Jose Tabata with a pitch with two outs in the ninth. In his second, against the Mets at Citi Field on Oct. 3, Scherzer tied Ryans 1973 record for strikeouts in a no-hitter, with 17.It has not always been easy for Scherzer. In his last start, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, he allowed seven runs in five innings. The last time he had pitched in Washington, on April 26 against Philadelphia, Scherzer needed 116 pitches to plod through five innings.My fastballs in a little bit of a funk, he said that night, explaining that he was not getting the proper arm extension to attack the strike zone at his usual rate.Scherzer changed all that on Wednesday, attacking the zone ferociously, leading to a game for the ages. He threw 96 strikes and just 23 balls and got a salute on Twitter from Wood.Congratulations to @Max_Scherzer on an impressive and dominant performance tonight, Wood wrote. Welcome to the club! He followed with a hashtag and a word to describe Scherzers stuff: filthy."}
{"text": "Kwame Somburu, a 1960s radical who vainly sought elective office as a perennial candidate of the Socialist Workers Party in New York and California, died on May 3 in Albany. He was 81.The cause was complications of kidney cancer, his son Daryl Boutelle said.Mr. Somburu evolved from a high school dropout named Paul Boutelle, who sold the Great Books of the Western World series door to door and voted for the straight Republican ticket in 1956, into a public school teacher who adopted the name of a Kenyan tribe and embraced a Trotskyite scientific socialism forged in anti-imperialism and class-conscious black nationalism.He renounced violence but echoed Malcolm Xs credo of gaining black power by any means necessary; organized blacks against the war in Vietnam; unambiguously declared that if it werent for crime and lies and terrorism and massacres thered be no United States; and, while insisting that he was not anti-Semitic, vigorously opposed Zionism.In his first of nine campaigns for public office, he ran for the State Senate in Harlem in 1964 as a candidate of the Freedom Now Party, a branch of a fledgling all-black organization formed in Michigan. But after his defeat, he acknowledged that a black political mass movement was probably premature.Instead he joined the Socialist Workers Party, which, he explained in the partys newspaper, The Militant, has a consistent record of engagement in independent class politics, is the Marxist organization that has developed the best analysis of black nationalism, and has been from the start a firm supporter of efforts to build an independent black political party.Mr. Somburu was nominated by the party as its candidate for Manhattan borough president in 1965, for state attorney general in 1966, for vice president of the United States in 1968 and for mayor of New York in 1969.He ran for Congress once in Manhattan and twice in California, where he also campaigned to be mayor of Oakland before abandoning the party in 1983 in a policy dispute. He later joined Socialist Action and the Socialist Workers Organization.Paul Benjamin Boutelle was born in Harlem on Oct. 13, 1934, to Anton Boutelle, a self-taught electrician, and the former Anna May Benjamin, a seamstress.He said he quit the High School of Commerce when he was 16 because he was bored after being indoctrinated in Christianity, Capitalism and Caucasianism. He was working as a taxi driver when he ran for vice president.During that campaign, he jousted with William F. Buckley Jr. on his television program Firing Line. At one point Mr. Buckley suggested that if he, Mr. Buckley, were campaigning in the South, his philosophy would appeal to black voters more than Mr. Somburus would.Mr. Somburu responded, Im sure if you went down to Mississippi and told black people they were free, you would be running, and it wouldnt be for office.Mr. Somburu left New York for California in 1973. He graduated from California State University, Hayward (now California State University, East Bay) and went on to teach in California schools. He changed his name to Kwame Montsho Ajamu Somburu in 1979. He later moved to Massachusetts and then to New York, near Albany.His marriage to Myrna Mondesire ended in divorce. In addition to their son Daryl, he is survived by another son, Asi-Yahola Somburu, from his marriage to Zakiya Somburu, who died in 2010; a stepson, Khalid Sheffield; two sisters, Elvira Boutelle and Jean Waters; two brothers, Allen Boutelle and Dr. Ronald Boutelle; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren."}

Phlegm.How did those words make you feel?So begins a recent article about the science behind our aversion to certain words, which The Times followed up with a piece on the everyday words that readers said made them go ew.What words disgust or bother you? Why? (Please leave out words with explicit sexual, scatological, racial or taboo connotations.)In We Know You Hate Moist. What Other Words Repel You?, Jonah Bromwich writes:Certain everyday words drive some people crazy, a phenomenon experts call word aversion. But one word appears to rise above all others: moist. For that reason, a recent paper in the journal PLOS One used the word as a stand-in to explore why people find some terms repellent.It doesnt really fit into a lot of existing categories for how people think about the psychology of language, the studys author, Paul Thibodeau, a professor of psychology at Oberlin College, said of moist. Its not a taboo word, its not profanity, but it elicits this very visceral disgust reaction.A little less than a quarter of the approximately 2,500 unique subjects tested in Mr. Thibodeaus five experiments over four years had trouble dealing with any appearance of the word.When asked to react to moist in a free-association task, about one-third of those people responded with an expression of disgust, Mr. Thibodeau said. Almost two-thirds of those who later reported an aversion were so bothered by moist that they could recall its inclusion among a set of 63 other words  an unusually high rate.The peer-reviewed study attempted to explain why moist had become the linguistic equivalent of nails on a chalkboard for some people.Words that sound similar  including hoist, foist and rejoiced  did not put off participants in the same way, suggesting that aversion to the word was not based on the way it sounds. But people who were bothered by moist also found that words for bodily fluids  vomit, puke and phlegm  largely struck a nerve. That led Mr. Thibodeau to conclude that for those people moist had taken on the connotations of a bodily function.Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: What words did you think of right away when you saw the question at the top of this post? Why do you think they bother you so much? Was moist on your list? Now that youve read the article, can you add to your list? Are words for or suggestive of bodily fluids on your list? Are there any words on your list that dont sound as if they belong in English, as the scientists in this piece suggest could lead to an emotional reaction? The Times invited readers to write in with words that repel them. Read the results. Which of those words would go on your list? Why? What words are on your list that arent mentioned in any of these articles?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below.

{"text": "European antitrust officials on Wednesday rebuffed renewed efforts to consolidate the regions telecommunications sector, blocking a proposed $14.5 billion deal between two major British carriers.Under the proposed deal, Hutchison Whampoa, one of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shings flagship companies, which owns the British operator Three, had sought to acquire O2, a rival in Britain owned by the Spanish telecom giant Telefnica.But Europes competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said the deal would limit consumer choice and could raise prices in Britain. We want the mobile telecoms sector to be competitive, so that consumers can enjoy innovative mobile services at fair prices and high network quality, Ms. Vestager said in a statement on Wednesday.Ms. Vestagers tough stance comes as the Danish politician has taken a muscular approach to defending Europes competition rules, including charging Google for abusing its market position with some of its online search products and with its use of Android, its smartphone operating system.The European Commission has also accused Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, of antitrust practices in the natural gas markets. Google and Gazprom deny any wrongdoing.Threes failed takeover of O2, an antitrust decision widely expected by many in Europes flagging telecom industry, comes amid growing uncertainty in the sector after a series of other deals among the regions more than 100 local carriers fell through.Those include an attempt by Orange, Frances former monopoly, to buy Bouygues Telecom, a local rival, for more than $11 billion. That bid failed after the two sides said last month that they could not agree to terms. Last year, the carriers Telenor and TeliaSonera also called off talks to combine their Danish operations after failing to win European antitrust approval.Many of the regions policy makers remain skeptical over such deals, concerned that multibillion-dollar takeovers could lead to increased cellphone-plan prices just as people become increasingly reliant on their mobile devices. On average, Europeans pay roughly half as much for their monthly cellphone contracts as Americans do, according to the GSMA, an industry group.But many in the telecom industry have urged greater consolidation, claiming that fewer players in each of the European Unions 28 member states could help drive increased spending on high-speed mobile networks and other infrastructure needed to keep pace with the United States and Asia.The collapse of the deal leaves both Three and O2 in a precarious position with uncertain futures in the U.K., said Kester Mann, a London-based analyst with the research company CCS Insight. It also casts serious doubt over the future structure of a European telecoms sector that had banked on the tie-up paving the way to further consolidation.Europes mounting hesitation to approve telecom deals also contrasts with the United States, where companies like Comcast and Verizon Communications, among others, are extending their reach beyond their traditional business into new markets. Last month, Comcast bought DreamWorks Animation, a movie studio, for $3.8 billion.Such deals, however, remain mostly out of bounds in Europe, where lawmakers have prioritized consumer choice, including access to at least four telecom operators in many countries, over consolidation.As part of its decision on Wednesday, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said the takeover would have removed an important competitor. It added that reduced competition would probably have led to higher prices and lower quality on mobile services.Telefnica and Hutchison Whampoa had offered concessions, including allowing access to their networks to competitors, in an effort to win approval for the deal.Hutchison Whampoa said in a statement that it was deeply disappointed by the commissions decision, and that it would consider a legal challenge.The decision to block the merger has already prompted other telecom and cable operators to circle O2. Companies that appear interested in picking up the British carrier include Liberty Global, the cable operator controlled by the American billionaire John C. Malone; and Iliad, a French carrier.In a conference call with analysts last week, Jos Mara lvarez-Pallete Lpez, Telefnicas executive chairman, said that, regardless of the commissions decision, his company had a very comfortable cash position that meant it would not need to rush into deciding what to do with O2."}
{"text": "Over the last five years, Paddle8 has sought to shake up the world of online art auctions. In Europe, and for almost the same amount of time, Auctionata has tried to do the same in its own way.Now the two online auction houses are planning to join forces.Auctionata and Paddle8 are expected to announce on Thursday that they will merge, seeking to create a bigger specialist in selling art online with a broader international reach.Even combined, the two do not dream of displacing the giants of the art world, the auction houses Sothebys and Christies. Both Paddle8 and Auctionata focus on what they call the middle market for art sales: objects more valuable than can be sold on eBay, but generally topping out at $500,000.Of course, sometimes the companies run auctions for more expensive items. Paddle8 gained notoriety when it auctioned the sole copy of the final album by the Wu-Tang Clan last year, raising $2 million. (The buyer was eventually revealed to be Martin Shkreli, the former pharmaceutical executive who is facing federal securities fraud charges.)And Auctionata, whose unusual features include livestreamed auctions, sold an 18th-century Chinese clock for $3.83 million last summer.The start-ups aim is to disrupt scores of smaller auction houses, largely brick-and-mortar and without an online presence. By contrast, the two start-ups were born with the express intent of reaching broad audiences by tapping the Internet for both objects to be sold and potential buyers.We will be able to pick up an object and sell it quicker than anyone else in the world, Alexander Zacke, the chief executive of Auctionata, said in a telephone interview.Buying art online has become a small but quickly growing part of the global business in fine art. Beyond Sothebys and Christies  both of which have focused on digital sales in recent years  other players include Artsy, Artnet and 1stdibs.Since their founding, both Auctionata and Paddle8 have gained prominence as online art marketplaces. A ranking of online art platforms compiled by the research firm Hiscox, based on a survey of 672 art buyers, ranked Paddle8 fifth and Auctionata at ninth. By comparison, Christies LIVE placed first, while Sothebys BIDnow ranked fourth.Together, Auctionata and Paddle8 reported sales in 2015 of around $140 million and have a combined user base of nearly 800,000.Both companies have drawn backing from big names in the world of art and luxury: Auctionatas investors include Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, while Paddle8s include the artist Damien Hirst and the gallery owner David Zwirner. All existing investors are expected to remain on board with the newly combined auction house.The two companies have known each other for years. Mr. Zacke regularly meets with Paddle8s founders, according to Aditya Julka, a Paddle8 founder. But nearly two years ago, Mr. Zacke conceded that his company would have a difficult time breaking into the United States, and Mr. Julka said his start-up would struggle to move into Europe.Combining would allow each company to more easily move into new geographies and markets, as well as share new technologies.Founders of both companies declined to disclose specific terms of the deal, though Mr. Zacke said that because Auctionata was bigger in terms of sales, its shareholders would receive more equity in the combined company.Mr. Zacke will also lead the combined company, though all the founders will remain in top roles.Both Mr. Zacke and Mr. Julka repeatedly called the deal a merger, meant to fuse both companies cultures together. The combined entity  whose new name has yet to be determined  will retain both the Paddle8 and the Auctionata names and their own headquarters, in New York and Berlin, respectively.Were quite focused on doing this together, Mr. Julka said. For every practical purpose, its a merger."}

Just an informal gathering  a bunch of actors around a table at a rehearsal studio, reading aloud for the first time from the musicals second act. Mr. Odom could play Aaron Burr.It had been only a few years since he shot a TV pilot for a show that did not get picked up, leaving him so disheartened about acting that he started applying for jobs as a hotel clerk. But he had been moved to tears as an audience member at a reading of the first act earlier that summer at Vassars Powerhouse Theater.So he leapt into action. He learned Burrs big songs. He read up on Hamilton. He dressed to kill.You have to walk toward the things that make you alive, he said.The shows director, Thomas Kail, took note. He was coming to play, he said. He was inspired. But, just in case, Mr. Odom aggressively pursued Mr. Kail as Hamilton progressed. I didnt hide any of my cards, he said. I would text Tommy after every single reading: I love this part. I want to stay with this part.Three years later, Hamilton is a huge hit, and Mr. Odom, 34, is its ambitious antihero. Night after night, re-enacting the most famous duel in American history, he slays the shows title character. And now he is a Tony nominee, competing, in life as in the show, against the shows creator and star, Mr. Miranda.His performance, as a strategic striver, a jealous rival and a doting father, is magnetic. He owns the one razzle-dazzle showstopper, The Room Where It Happens. And he is not only the shows antagonist (Im the damn fool that shot him, he sings in the opening), but is also a rueful commentator (I survived, but I paid for it, he sings. Now Im the villain in your history.)Oh, how Mr. Odom hungered to be that villain.This is the show I was waiting for my whole life, he said early one Sunday at a recording studio in Long Island City, where he was spending a day off from Hamilton working on a coming solo album of jazz standards. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt and a black fur-lined hat with giant earflaps as he and his band worked through the Jule Styne classic The Partys Over, trying to find the right bossa nova rhythm.Some days later, pacing around his well-appointed dressing room at the Richard Rodgers Theater, he took that thought even further. There is a chance that this is the greatest role I might ever have in my life, he said. And thats O.K. If this is the greatest role I ever have in my life, thank God I got to do it.Mr. Odom not only had to persuade Mr. Miranda and Mr. Kail he was right for the role, but then, as Hamilton moved toward an Off Broadway production, he also had to get out of a television show that was taping at the same time.His part on NBCs State of Affairs, produced by and starring Katherine Heigl, would have been far more lucrative than playing Aaron Burr, but he had no doubt what he wanted. He emailed Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, and begged to be let out of his contract; happily, Mr. Greenblatt a theater fan and producer who later invested in Hamilton himself, gave his O.K.Mr. Odom hungered to join the Hamilton cast because he recognized the ambition of the lyrics, the appeal of the music, the drama of the story. But there was something else, too.He remembered the envy he had felt in a production of Jersey Boys, realizing that theres going to be four really lucky white guys, all over the world, that are going to get to play these parts.As a black actor, I can just tell you that I saw the potential to turn what is expected of us so often on its head, he said. Were oftentimes asked to stop the show, or to make em laugh, but were very rarely asked for vulnerability, very rarely asked for complication. And here was a role where he got to do Room Where It Happens and he gets to do Dear Theodosia. You just dont find parts like that. You dont.After more than two years with Aaron Burr, Mr. Odom has developed a bit of sympathy for his character. None of us wants to be judged by our worst act on our worst day, and we consistently judge Burr for that, he said. He was not a perfect man, but hes not a villain. Hes a dude, just a guy.Like the character he plays, Mr. Odom is deft, stylish and charismatic. He was always sure of himself, sure of his abilities, passionate and driven, knowing what he wanted to accomplish and setting out to do just that, said the Tony-winning actress Patina Miller, who Mr. Odom mentored when he was a senior and she was a freshman at Carnegie Mellon University. (He specifically asked to be assigned to advise a student of color, saying, I know what its like to be ignored; when I got to L.A., I longed for somebody who looked like me to show me the ropes.)He believes deeply in focus  clearing away whatever he doesnt need to worry about so he can concentrate on his art  and now has a retinue of helpers. He gets three meals delivered each day, so he doesnt have to think about food; he has a stylist and a nutritionist and a trainer, and hes become a practitioner of cryotherapy  standing in a chamber cooled by liquid nitrogen  to ease the aches and pains from dancing up and down the staircases on the Hamilton set.He is also determined to use the voice he has gained with his newfound celebrity. He was one of the Hamilton casts most vocal champions of profit-sharing  successfully insisting that the actors who helped develop the show should benefit financially from its enormous success. It almost broke our company, and almost broke our show, because we couldnt reconcile the beauty and love with the business, Mr. Odom said. But we found our way through it.He grew up in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, the son of a salesman and a nursing-home recreation director. At 5, he got a tape recorder, and he would listen to himself sing for hours; a few years later, he graduated to a karaoke machine. His first performances were in a Baptist church.School was a bit rough  academics came easy, though young Leslie had a problem with authority and was often in trouble. But one year, as a prize in an African-American history oratory competition, he was awarded a summer scholarship to Freedom Theater, which focused on the African-American tradition. He was 13, taking acting and movement classes, and hooked; he began doing school plays, with a first role as a slave in The Miracle Worker.People just kept pointing me to the stage, thank God, he said.And then, one night, he saw a TV report on Rent. He had never been to Broadway. But he was stunned  he found it sexy, and rebellious, and joyful, and he wanted in.That was the bat signal for me  Rent changed my life, he said. It took me years before I got beyond that show.Of course, lots of teenagers loved Rent. But Mr. Odom, all of 17 and still in high school, actually auditioned and got himself cast in the show  he was a replacement member of the ensemble, but he was on Broadway.Even as he enrolled at Carnegie Mellon, he was offered a role in another Broadway musical, Disneys Aida, as Mereb. His parents were determined for him to get a college education, but said they would defer to his choice, and he chose Broadway. Then his mother called him, crying over his decision.He turned down the role and stayed in school. It would be nearly 15 years before he found his way back to Broadway, but he says she was absolutely right.By the time he arrived at that fateful New York Stage and Film reading at Vassar, he had spent nearly a decade in Los Angeles, working mostly in television, but also singing in clubs. It was there that he met the woman who would become his wife, the actress Nicolette Robinson, while working on a production of Once on this Island.He moved to New York for Smash, a television series about the making of a musical, with a recurring role as the love interest of Christian Borle. (The most important thing about that for me was that I did not want it to be titillating, he said. I wanted everyone to understand why those two men were falling in love, and that it was just like any other relationship youd ever seen. Thats all I cared about.) There was a short-lived musical, Leap of Faith on Broadway, and roles on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Person of Interest.When he saw the early version of Hamilton at Vassar, he assumed there was no room for him in the show  he knew Mr. Miranda had a bit of a posse and tended to collaborate with his friends, one of whom played Burr there. But the role had become more vocally demanding with the development of the shows second act, and Mr. Odom seemed like a good fit.Mr. Odom instinctively understood both the language of Mr. Miranda and the psyche of Burr. He has a soulfulness underneath that matches Lins writing style  even when Leslies not dancing, you can see the beat happening in his body, said Andy Blankenbuehler, the shows choreographer.Mr. Blankenbuehler recalled how, while developing The Room Where It Happens, he wanted Burr to own the scene by placing his palms on a desktop and leaning over it, like a king. Mr. Odom chose instead to sit behind the desk, leaning back, with his feet up on the surface, like a boss.His position was so much more powerful than mine, Mr. Blankenbuehler said. My position was pushing power  his was, I dont even have to do anything to own you.Mr. Odom, whose contract with Hamilton expires in July, said he does not know whether he will stay with the show, or what will happen next. I dont have any control over the offers that are going to come to me, or not come to me, he said. But I cant go backward, and so thats whats tricky. After Aaron Burr, its got to be a good part, its got to be an interesting part.In the meantime, he is still trying to improve his performance in the show he fought so hard to join. Until I levitate, I have work to do, he said. Thats the day Ill retire. When I actually fly."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  As his party splinters and his policy agenda faces peril, Speaker Paul D. Ryan will enter his meeting with Donald J. Trump on Thursday increasingly at odds with a growing, if grudging, Republican congressional majority willing to embrace Mr. Trump as their candidate.The decision of Mr. Ryan, the partys most prominent skeptic of its polarizing new standard-bearer, will echo well beyond this campaign season when he anticipates rebuilding his partys post-Trump brand, possibly with the speaker himself at the top of the 2020 presidential ticket.To pretend were unified as a party would lead Republicans to go into the fall at half sprint, Mr. Ryan said Wednesday after meeting with G.O.P. House members. He suggested that he hoped Mr. Trump would show an openness to change on substance and tone when they meet on Thursday.But Mr. Trump has said he has no intention of reinventing himself for the general election  a declaration that could force Mr. Ryan to acquiesce in the name of Republican unity or establish himself as the leading voice of opposition within the party.While Mr. Ryan has repeatedly cited his desire to unify his party and to reject the nasty tone of the Republican primary campaign, he appears to have complex motivations.He and his staff play down talk of a 2020 run for the White House, but how Mr. Ryan manages Mr. Trump over the next six months will play a major role in shaping Mr. Ryans future. Many of his colleagues are uneasy about Mr. Trump and grateful that the speaker is at least buying them time to determine how to handle the political equivalent of a live grenade.Many congressional Republicans also view Mr. Ryan as a tantalizing prospect for the White House.I think hed make a great president, said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, echoing a view shared by others like Mr. Ryans predecessor, former Speaker John A. Boehner, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah.Still, there are Republicans who have little use for Mr. Ryans reluctance to support Mr. Trump and say the time for hand-wringing has passed.Hes going to be the nominee, said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina. So the choice is him or a Democrat. And that makes it a little tough to figure out why people are saying Ive got to wait to hear more.Mr. Ryans immediate goals, his advisers say, are to advance his agenda and protect the Republican majority in the House. Many of those goals involve policy that is sharply different from Mr. Trumps brand of hard-edged nationalism.Mr. Ryans desire to overhaul the immigration system, rein in the nations entitlement programs, promote vigorous free trade and push other aspects of traditional conservatism have been as welcome to Republican voters this year as carpenter ants at a home inspection.This has alarmed the speaker because it bodes poorly for his chances for advancing what he calls reform conservatism.Those close to Mr. Ryan say he tends to put his policy agenda ahead of party loyalty.People in politics tend to be in two categories, said Peter Wehner, a director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives under President George W. Bush, who has known Mr. Ryan for two decades.Some are drawn to politics because they like the games and mechanics, and their first priority is the party, Mr. Wehner said. Bob Dole fell into that category. Mitch McConnell is also that party guy. And Ryan is just more in that camp of ideas, and he thinks about the party mostly as a vehicle to advance conservatism.Mr. Ryans associates say he has also been repulsed by Mr. Trumps bombastic tone and proposals like his call to ban Muslim immigrants and visitors.But he is just as motivated by his concern for protecting his House majority, something that was not even in question until Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee. Although many analysts say the majority is safe for now, some of the most endangered House Republicans come from districts where Mr. Trump could be particularly damaging to their prospects.There is, for example, little upside to Mr. Trump for Republicans like Representative Robert Dold, who represents the moderate-leaning north shore Chicago suburbs, or Representative Carlos Curbelo, who has a heavily Hispanic district in South Florida.No former House speaker since James K. Polk has gone on to win the presidency, but if Mr. Ryan started a campaign in four or eight years, he would begin with a formidable network of donors built up during his time in the House and while he was Mitt Romneys running mate in 2012.Mr. Romney may be the biggest booster of a future Ryan White House campaign.I would love to see him run for president, Mr. Romney said of Mr. Ryan at a private fund-raiser in Washington last week for an Israeli university. A recording of Mr. Romneys remarks was shared with The New York Times by an attendee.Mr. Ryan has deepened his connection to the Republican donor universe since taking over the speakership last year, raising $23.5 million for his House colleagues.Dan Senor, a friend of Mr. Ryans who advised him during the 2012 White House race, said he was skeptical that the speaker would try to use the House as a presidential launching pad.The building of the machine would be easy, its just a question of if he actually ever wants to do it, Mr. Senor said. I dont think he will.While Mr. Ryan is seen as an institutional Republican relative to Mr. Trump, he draws from a brain trust that exists in large part off Capitol Hill.A protg of Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York, Mr. Ryan is a free markets and free people conservative of the sort venerated by The Wall Street Journal editorial page.His outside informal consulting group includes Mr. Wehner; George Weigel, a founding president of the conservative James Madison Foundation; Yuval Levin, a founding editor of National Affairs; and many from Kemp world. Paul is very interested in Catholic social doctrine, which is something I have written about extensively, so we talk a lot about that, Mr. Weigel said.But this year, at least, Republican primary voters demonstrated no appetite for Mr. Ryans style of aspirational conservatism, having rejected both Senator Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, both of Florida.Still, what ultimately may push Mr. Ryan toward a presidential run of his own is rooted in the agonizing situation he is enduring right now: a recognition that his ambitions for remaking his party into something that reflects his vision will not be realized outside of the White House because his push for an overhaul of the nations tax, entitlement and poverty programs toward a more free market orientation may be stymied unless he becomes president.He has now seen the power of the bully pulpit, said Bob Wood, a lobbyist and, like Mr. Ryan, a native Wisconsinite.While Mr. Ryan keeps his eyes on getting through 2016, many of his Republican colleagues are clearly looking to 2020. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Never Trump leader, is widely viewed as angling for a run, as is Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas; Mr. Cottons state is considering a bill that would make it easier for him to run for re-election and the White House at the same time.But most eyes are currently on Mr. Ryan, his demurrals notwithstanding.He says hes not, Mr. Burr said.  I take everybody at their word. Then he paused. Some mornings, I feel like Im the only one looking in the mirror that doesnt see the next president up here."}
{"text": "TEL AVIV  Israels army is a peoples army, and this is usually a time when we Israelis recognize that. On Wednesday, we solemnly mark Memorial Day. On Thursday, we joyously celebrate Independence Day. Its a week when the country salutes the Israel Defense Forces, the institution that defends its fragile being, and the I.D.F. salutes the public, which sends its sons and daughters to mandatory service.But this year hasnt been typical. The I.D.F. is facing a barrage of criticism. The army, which historically enjoyed support across the Jewish Israeli spectrum, has become politicized. That this has happened is a failure of the I.D.F.s leaders, a failure similar to losing in battle. Worse yet, the I.D.F. cannot win on the battlefield without the Israeli publics trust.The immediate reason for the outrage was a speech last week by the I.D.F.s deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Yair Golan. In remarks on Holocaust Remembrance Day, General Golan said that he sees similarities between Nazi Germany of the 1930s and Israel today when it comes to signs of intolerance and violence.Unsurprisingly, his speech was not well received. For one thing, Holocaust Remembrance Day is not the time for controversial political statements. Moreover, what he said is nonsense. Israel is guilty of many sins, but abhorrent processes that took place in Europe, as he put it, are not happening here. The general was repudiated by politicians, mocked on social media and called upon by pundits to resign. Probably taken aback by such an angry reaction, General Golan backtracked the next day, albeit unconvincingly.But General Golans remarks did not emerge in a vacuum. For the last several months there seems to be a widening gap between the public and the I.D.F. on matters of civil behavior.In February, the I.D.F.s chief of staff puzzled many Israelis when, referring to Palestinian knifing attacks, he said that he did not want to see a soldier empty a magazine at a girl holding scissors. Israelis, he hinted, are too trigger-happy when it comes to Palestinian attackers. A survey found that a majority of the Jewish Israeli public did not support his call for caution.In March, a soldier shot a wounded Palestinian attacker in the head as he lay on the ground. The I.D.F., rightly, arrested the soldier and condemned the breach of conduct. The public, again, disagreed. A poll found that 68 percent of the Jewish public disapproved of the soldiers treatment by the I.D.F. According to one analysis, 82 percent of social media responses supported the soldier. There are more than enough institutions, Israelis feel, that specialize in smearing the Israeli military. Commanders shouldnt hand them ammunition.These incidents are all connected: The I.D.F.s top brass is troubled by signs that the Israeli public is less committed to keeping a high moral standard when fighting battles than it used to be. Yes, a Palestinian with a weapon could be dangerous, but the I.D.F. wants to avoid bloodshed when an attacker is a 13-year-old girl. Yes, an attacker could be killed, but the I.D.F. doesnt want to kill people who are on the ground and pose no danger. Yes, the I.D.F. drafts brave and dedicated Israelis, but it is worried about an Israel in which there is a detectable increase in hateful language and a troubling disregard for human life.The armys leaders are in a difficult position. They have good reason to be concerned about these trends; in fact, all Israelis should be. But these leaders are also uncertain how to deal with a society that is rapidly changing. Many of them are still the members of an old elite, mostly secular and aligned with the Labor Party, that is losing power to more right-wing, more religious Israelis. These leaders feel that part of their sacred mission of guarding the country involves maintaining the standards of morality and integrity that they were taught.But military leaders should know that winning a fight depends on having a solid strategy and executing proper tactics. When it comes to managing Israelis perceptions, the I.D.F. seems to have neither.And the public is becoming increasingly divided when it comes to the leaders of Israels most revered institution: The left (a smaller group) defends them, while the right (the growing majority) resents their lecturing. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called General Golans speech infuriating, while opposition leaders support the generals. The former foreign minister Tzipi Livni said she was proud of General Golan, who is filling a vacuum of leadership.As politicians turn the I.D.F. into a political football, the center  that is, most of us  watches in horror. We need our army to win all of the good battles. And that includes the battle it is now clumsily waging: to keep Israels norms intact without losing its status as Israels army of the people. The I.D.F.s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, acknowledged that in his Memorial Day speech on Tuesday. Israels soldiers must know beyond a shadow of a doubt, he said, that the whole nation supports them. To achieve that, General Eisenkot and his colleagues should be as vigilant as needed in enforcing standards on the battlefield, and leave the political debates to politicians."}
{"text": "The head of the National Association for Music Education, an advocacy group, left his post on Wednesday after participants at a recent meeting on diversity said that he had told them that his organization was not diverse partly because blacks and Latinos lack the keyboard skills needed for this field.The remark, which was attributed to Michael A. Butera, the executive director and chief executive of the association, created a firestorm after it circulated online. The association placed him on administrative leave on Tuesday while it investigated the allegations, and announced on Wednesday that its board and Mr. Butera had agreed that he will not be returning.His departure comes as many sectors of the music industry  from leading orchestras to conservatories  have lagged in achieving diversity, particularly when it comes to hiring black and Hispanic musicians.The events that led to Mr. Buteras departure began at an April 26 meeting in Washington of arts service organization leaders arranged by the National Endowment for the Arts. Participants broke up into small groups to discuss diversity.Keryl McCord, the operations director of Alternate Roots, an Atlanta-based arts group, wrote online that she had sat at a table with Mr. Butera, who said his board was all white and that he could not diversify it because its members were elected, not appointed. She said that he added the comment about blacks and Latinos lacking necessary keyboard skills.Mr. Butera later responded on Facebook that the reporting of these comments was a deeply inaccurate portrayal of the dialogue which took place that day. He added that since the associations board was elected by its members, he could not unilaterally diversify it.I also mentioned that the field of music educators, much like the general population of educators, is skewed toward white individuals, he wrote. We have had ongoing and rich discussions in our association community about how best to address this issue, but have not yet been able to actualize a solution. This is not for lack of trying, but simply because of the enormous complexity of the issue.Another participant who sat at the table, Jesse Rosen, president and chief executive of the League of American Orchestras, confirmed Ms. McCords account in a post he wrote on the leagues website. Mr. Butera indeed said that he could not take action to diversify his board, and that African Americans and Latinos lacked keyboard skills needed to advance in the music education profession  two statements which many of us around the table challenged, Mr. Rosen wrote. The group was unable to further pursue the meaning of his comments as Mr. Butera abruptly and angrily walked out of the room, well in advance of the meetings scheduled end time.Mr. Butera, reached through a message on his Facebook page, said that he had left the meeting early because he had a prior engagement, and declined further comment. A former public school music teacher who worked for the National Education Association before becoming executive director of the association for music education in 2010, Mr. Butera earned more than $250,000 in base compensation and benefits, according to the associations most recent tax filing.In announcing his departure, the association thanked him for his service to our purpose and mission and announced that he would be succeeded by Michael Blakeslee, who has worked with the group for nearly 30 years.Mr. Blakeslee said in an interview that the organization, more than a century old, would renew its focus on inclusion and diversity, from looking again at the makeup of its board to working to ensure equal access to music education for all students. Our mission statement is music for all, and we take that very seriously, he said."}
{"text": "Austin, Tex.  ON Monday morning, ride-sharing customers in Americas 11th-largest city awoke to a disconcerting message on their phones: Uber not currently available in Austin.Having lost a referendum over whether they would be regulated by the local government, the ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft followed through on their threat to effectively fire 10,000 drivers and strand thousands of customers who had come to rely on them for transportation in this hot, spread-out, car-centric city.In the weeks leading up to the vote, the companies spent nearly $9 million, one of the largest amounts ever spent on an Austin election. And yet by making this an all-or-nothing referendum, Uber and Lyft made it about much more than, well, Uber and Lyft. It became a referendum on who is in the drivers seat (pun intended) when it comes to the public weal: new-economy powerhouses out to disrupt society for fun and profit, or the people theyre seeking to disrupt. In Austin, it wasnt even close.Uber and Lyft arrived in the Texas capital in 2014, and it probably seemed like a perfect fit. The metro area has more than two million people and attracts 20 million visitors a year, many to its two huge music festivals. There are lots of young people and a strong tech economy that would flock to ride sharing. But Austin probably also looked like a pushover, as a city  even now it retains a certain sleepiness, a vestige of its provincial college-town past, before anyone thought it even necessary to remind us to keep Austin weird.The companies certainly made a splash. The celebrity chef Paul Qui hitched the first ride, and both Uber and Lyft gave free rides for two glorious weeks. The city has too few cabs, and with several college campuses and the endless blocks of bars along Sixth Street, Uber and Lyft seemed to fit right in.But what they failed to appreciate was that Austins long and storied counterculture wasnt just a marketing pose. Thirty years ago, the city became an oxbow in the river of American culture, rejecting the Reagan eras go-go 80s and embracing rebel musicians and as much weed and as little hard work as possible. Punk rock found a home here, as did Richard Linklater, who encapsulated the era in his classic 1991 movie Slacker.A new culture came along in the 1990s, as tech companies tried to harness the brain power coming out of the local colleges. New sections of the city sprang up, threatening the familiar, worn fabric of old Austin. But since 1992, locals, including young tech workers, repeatedly dealt new Austin bone-crushing defeats in rejecting developments that would threaten the endangered Barton Springs salamander.That spirit continues today, even if most of the country thinks of Austin through the corporatized lens that is the South by Southwest festival. Locals know different. We are obsessed with our citys identity and sense of community, and we are particularly wary of outsiders who come in promising to change us. Thats not because we dont like outsiders, mind you. But as a rebellious patch of blue in a deep-crimson state, we learned a long time ago that there are people who are eager to change who we are, and not for our benefit.And here is where Uber and Lyft made their first mistake. A collision of communitarian social activism with Ayn Rand-style technology disruption was probably inevitable. Wrong fight. Wrong time. Wrong town, said Ron Marks, an alum of the old punk rock scene who had a role in Slacker.To be clear: The city never told Uber and Lyft to leave. But it did insist that they play by our rules and have drivers be fingerprinted, just like cabbies  particularly after the police investigated at least seven alleged sexual assaults by ride-share drivers in 2015. Instead, the companies responded by helping to put Proposition 1 on the ballot: They would be absolutely exempt from fingerprinting by the city. Period.That was the second mistake. They arrogantly confused a convenience for a few as a necessity for the many. Sure, over-served music fans and run-of-the-mill drunks got home safe and sound. Hipster techies from New York and San Francisco jetted in, summoned their drivers and jetted back out.Uber and Lyft have claimed they will reduce the nations traffic, but in Austin they just added to the aggravation. Their drivers stop on the road, no matter where they are, at any time, to pick up people, fumed my friend Laura Bettor, a psychologist. Austin already has an anxiety problem about traffic.The ultimatum was Uber and Lyfts third and fatal mistake. We dont take kindly to threats. Right before the election they announced that if they didnt get their way they would maroon all the customers and leave. As my friend Mark Seiler said, That just brought out my inner gorilla.Will the Battle of Austin become a model for other cities looking to regulate ride-sharing companies? Maybe. What it does show, though, is that Uber and Lyft will have a harder time bullying cities with strong local identities, places where convenience is not the same as necessity, especially when the price is selling out a large chunk of public control.If nothing else, folks in Austin are feeling pretty good about themselves this week. We may be slackers, but were not pushovers."}
{"text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  On the walls of Harvards Weld Boathouse here on the banks of the Charles River, among the dozens of photos of womens crews gone by, is evidence of how long Gevvie Stone has been around the sport of rowing.Look at the black-and-white team picture of the 1984-85 Radcliffe varsity heavyweights. There, in the back row, is the coach, Lisa Stone. Thats Gevvies mom. Shes wearing maternity overalls.There I am, Gevvie Stone said last week, pointing at her moms round middle, in her belly!That was about 31 years ago. Of course Stone gravitated to the water. Born to parents who were top American Olympic scullers, she had a feeling shed end up racing a boat someday. I had an inkling Id be good at it, she told me.You might say it was meant to be. You cannot say, however, that it has been simple.To make it to the height of a sport is never easy, even for those athletes wired for greatness. Thats something to think about as teams bound for the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro come together in the next weeks and months.What, actually, did it take to make it to the top? What did they give up? What are they willing to risk for success in Rio?For Stone, the Olympic dream has had its stops and starts.Six feet tall and lean, she was part of an undefeated national championship womens eight crew at Princeton and won two world championships in under-23 competition. After graduating in 2007, she put her acceptance to the Tufts University School of Medicine on hold to train for the 2008 Olympics. For graduation, her parents even bought her a single scull, an ice-blue one with a red racing stripe, so she could fine-tune her skills in a small boat.Those seemed to be the blueprints of a daughter whose family is legendary in the sport, at least in these parts. But there was a glitch.Stone didnt make the cut for the Olympic team.I felt like a failure, said Gevvie, which is short for Genevra.Stone nearly gave up rowing after that. To get away, she worked as a camp counselor that summer while her former teammates raced in Beijing.But there was no getting away. One of her campers hinted that Stone, perhaps, should give the Olympics another try. She made a gift for Stone: a tiny paper boat with a tiny paper rower who held tiny paper oars. On the boats bow were written the words, 2012 Olympian.Stones heart skipped a beat. She took that boat home to her parents house in Newton, Mass., where it still sits in her old bedroom, not far from her rowing medals and the Tom Brady poster on the wall.Was the tiny boat a tiny harbinger? Maybe. But it took her father, Gregg, to actually coax Stone back onto the water.I just said, Lets just go out for some rows together,  Gregg Stone recalled. She said she wanted to quit, but I knew that she just needed to find her rhythm.They headed onto the Charles in their single sculls. He tweaked her technique; devised ways for her to be more graceful; started crafting her workouts. It sparked something special.With her father coaching her, Gevvie felt the boat move through the water in ways it never had before. She felt weightless, as if she were flying. It took her breath away. This, she said to herself, is why she loved the sport.Other coaches along the Charles noticed, and marveled.She didnt fit the mold the national team was looking for, said Liz OLeary, Radcliffes longtime coach, who won a bronze in double sculls with Stones mother at the 1977 and 1978 world championships. But outside the system, training on her own, with her dad coaching her  theres not many who can do what she has done.What has Stone done? She climbed back to the top of rowing when others would have given up. In rebuilding herself, she landed in the loneliest seat in the sport. While the rest of the United States womens national team trains in New Jersey, Stone is based here in Cambridge, in a bubble of her own making.In a tippy, feather-light single scull, there are no teammates to help her or motivate her. No one to blame if she falters. Its just Gevvie, flying or foundering. Sometimes on the water in the early morning, she doesnt see another soul. Sometimes the only sounds come from her oars turning in the oarlocks, or the blades cutting the water  or her own breath.For several years, Stone trained while in medical school. Her rationale? Classes ended at 4, so what was she supposed to do with the rest of the day?Totally doable, she said.Her multitasking worked. She made the United States team for the 2012 London Games, where she finished seventh, and kept right on going.Now, after having graduated from medical school in 2014, she is considered a medal contender in Rio by virtue of her fourth-place finish at the worlds last year.Her hands are yellowed and callused from years of gripping oar handles. Theyre not the delicate hands of a surgeon  but she hopes they will be. Stone, who will turn 31 in July, will apply to residencies in orthopedic surgery in September  after the Games.Before that, its one last shot at an Olympic medal. But getting to the starting line in Rio is not without its complications, either. Every one of this years Olympians must consider the threat of one more very serious obstacle: the Zika virus.Even though she is a doctor, Stone told me she had only had limited training in infectious diseases, especially tropical ones  and that was long before Zika became an issue. Even though she reads American Medical Association newsletters and keeps up with the Zika news, Stone  like so many other Olympians  said she was relying on the experts at the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to keep her safe.Its a hard call to make because were all invested in this and were not going to make totally rational decisions, she said.Ive heard the same from others headed to the Games this summer. Theyve sacrificed too much to turn back now. After all, some have spent a lifetime in and around their chosen sport  or in Stones case, even a few months longer than that.Its hard to imagine a single one, least of all one who rows a single, will let anything get in the way now."}
{"text": "We are honoring each of the Top 10 winners of our Third Annual Student Editorial Contest by publishing an essay a day. You can find them all here.Below, an essay by Holly Keaton, age 16.The Red Stain on SocietyThe first time I got my period, I had no idea what to do. I woke up with stained sheets and a feeling of humiliation in my stomach; the night before, I had, embarrassingly enough, put a pad on the wrong way. I relied on the Internet to fix my mistakes, for I was far too ashamed to ask my mom for help or consult her in any way. I had suffered through Human Interaction like the rest of my peers, but it proved inadequate in the face of my anxiety and intense mortification. Periods have always been a cringeworthy topic  it would take me years before I could comfortably discuss them with my female friends, and years more for me to casually mention them to my male ones.Menstruation has retained a slew of stigmas and misinformation; even though it is experienced by 50 percent of the worlds population, the other half is often alarmingly uninformed about it. Tampons are seen as taboo objects; boys will stumble away from one as if menstruation is a disease they can catch. Not to mention that girls in India have been told that they will pollute food and defile idols while on their period, and some are even isolated into cowsheds for the duration of their cycle. This incredibly natural and normal and human cycle is too often universally treated like a disease, one that girls should feel shame and embarrassment about.Perhaps the worst stigma associated with periods is that although they are considered unmentionable, men especially often use them to justify male superiority or to degrade and belittle women. Contrary to popular and misogynistic beliefs, the high levels of estrogen associated with menstruation actually deter women from impulsive decisions and increase synaptic connections with the hippocampus, the area of the brain related to short-term memory and decision-making, by 25 percent. So just because a womans uterus is shedding its inner lining, it doesnt mean she is increasingly prone to rash and emotional decisions.So because young girls across the world are petrified and embarrassed by a natural part of life; because the Internet taught me more about menstruation than school ever did; because boys are determined to avoid period talk even though they have sisters and mothers and girlfriends and friends who deal with it every month; because tampons and pads are taxed as luxury items, as though its a luxury to have your period; because the number of euphemisms for period is overwhelming; because womens merits are disregarded in favor of that time of the month jokes, its evident that periods need to not only be discussed, but also normalized and understood for what they are: simply another function of the human body.Works CitedBorreli, Lizette.

{"text": "KABUL, Afghanistan  Since his days as a C.I.A.-backed Afghan guerrilla leader against the Soviets in the 1980s, the former prime minister and perpetual insurgent Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has always seemed to be negotiating his next shift of alliances.Now, with his Hezb-i-Islami militant group nearly eclipsed by the Taliban, Mr. Hekmatyar, 68, is once again working a deal  this time to formally reconcile with the Afghan government for the first time since the end of the countrys civil war.After years of failed overtures, representatives of Mr. Hekmatyar, whose location is unknown, are now said to be finalizing a peace agreement with the struggling government of President Ashraf Ghani, according to representatives from both sides. If signed, the agreement would allow Mr. Hekmatyar to return to Kabul for the first time since 1996. That was when the Taliban pushed him out of power after he had negotiated a deal to become prime minister in return for ending his insurgency against the government.For Mr. Hekmatyar, history seems to repeat like that.But the timing of the efforts to make peace with Mr. Hekmatyars small faction of the insurgency this time has raised questions in Kabul. Mr. Ghanis government, failing to persuade the Taliban to come to the table this winter, is hoping that a quick deal with Mr. Hekmatyar, which evaded the previous administration, would bring it much-needed good news. The governments peace body, the High Peace Council, also needs to show some results for the hundreds of millions of dollars in donor money it has spent on the reconciliation process.Many fear Mr. Hekmatyar, known for his habit of breaking alliances, could be a larger political headache in Kabul than he is a military one in the battlefield, at a time when Mr. Ghanis coalition administration is already bogged down with infighting. Although forces loyal to Mr. Hekmatyar have attacked sporadically  including a 2013 car bombing that killed 16 people, including six American advisers  they have never been considered as serious a threat as the Taliban or the Haqqani network.Still, Mr. Hekmatyar is exceptionally divisive. He is accused of causing the deaths of thousands during the civil war, including the indiscriminate shelling of Kabul  much like rival warlords who are now allied with the government or have positions within it. After receiving copious cash and weaponry from the Americans during the war against the Soviets, he threw in his lot with remnants of the Communist government, then briefly with Taliban, and then Al Qaeda. In July last year, he was even rumored to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, though his aides later denied it.Through it all, he has remained a prolific writer. He frequently sends letters to his commanders and has published dozens of books on political and religious matters, with titles including Afghanistan  Another Vietnam for America, Dreams and Interpretations, and Bush, the King of Liars. More recently, he has also taken to recorded video messages, modulating his voice like a state-TV anchor as he recites long lectures and answers recorded questions.Abdul Qayoum Sajjadi, a member of the Afghan Parliament, said the government had resorted to dealing with Mr. Hekmatyar for political purposes and public opinion after failing to bring the Taliban to the table.It may not drastically change anything to restore peace since currently he doesnt command any fronts against the government, Mr. Sajjadi said. But still, having him inside is better than having him outside.Perhaps sensing an opportunity in the Ghani governments weakness, or feeling urgency of his own, he has eased his longstanding demands, which have included an unconditional and total withdrawal of all foreign forces.According to officials on both sides of the negotiation, some of the last points of disagreement were the timing of removing Mr. Hekmatyar and the Hezb-i-Islami militant wing from American and United Nations terrorism lists, and whether Mr. Hekmatyar is willing to renounce relations with extremist groups outside Afghanistan.Mr. Hekmatyars group is demanding to be taken off the terrorism lists before signing the agreement, while American officials have said the process takes time and can happen only after a formal request from the Afghan government when the agreement is signed, according to two Afghan officials close to the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing.In the meantime, the Americans have demanded Mr. Hekmatyar renounce relations to all global extremist groups. But Mr. Hekmatyars representatives say they can go only as far as groups threatening Afghanistan, because there is no universal definition of terrorism.Karim Amin, a negotiator for Mr. Hekmatyar in recent talks, said: How is it possible for Hezb-i-Islami to accept if Israel calls a group or party terrorist? It is not acceptable to us in any way. Similarly, if Burma calls a group terrorist, should we also consider that group terrorists? No way: We are not going to do that, never.The Afghan government is agreeing to provide Mr. Hekmatyar and his groups leadership with facilities to resettle in Kabul.Maulavi Atta ul Rahman Salim, the deputy head of the High Peace Council who has been negotiating with Mr. Hekmatyars team, said they had agreed to provide Hezb-i-Islami leadership with residences and an office. In fact, we have seen a couple of places, which are yet to be finalized.In addition, the leadership would be provided with vehicles and guards. All that together would amount to at least $4 million a year, according to one senior Afghan official involved in the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to characterize private negotiations.Mr. Hekmatyar is also asking for townships in Afghanistan to accommodate thousands of residents from a large refugee camp in Pakistan that his group has used as a base since the 1980s.If Mr. Hekmatyar does eventually make it to Kabul, he will find himself in an awkward place, lagging behind foes he fought for many years. During his 14 years on the sidelines, he missed the lucrative wave of American spending and favor  and the image rehabilitation  that his civil war rivals have enjoyed.At the same time, some of his former affiliates have also prospered without him. The political wing of Hezb-i-Islami has distanced itself from Mr. Hekmatyar over the past decade, and several members went on to become cabinet ministers in the Kabul government after the Talibans ouster in 2001.Mr. Amin, Mr. Hekmatyars chief negotiator who insists his leader is inside Afghanistan and not in Pakistan, where intelligence reports have placed him, would not comment on the preparations for his eventual return.During his comeback in 1996, those involved motorcades of white-uniformed guards and Mr. Hekmatyars portraits mounted on tanks. It is unclear whether any faction in Kabul, friend or foe, would go that far for him again."}
{"text": "BEIJING  British garden parties are not known as occasions for blunt talk, especially if they take place at Buckingham Palace.But on Tuesday, Queen Elizabeth II, clad in bright pink, had a frank exchange about China on her palace lawn with a Metropolitan Police commander, Lucy DOrsi. They spoke of conflicts that unfolded in London in October when President Xi Jinping of China and his entourage made a state visit to Britain, and at one point, the queen referred to the visiting officials as very rude.A transcript of that exchange is below.First, before hundreds of onlookers, the queen, 90, was introduced to Ms. DOrsi by the Lord Chamberlain, Earl Peel, who serves as head of the royal household.Ms. DOrsi spoke of an episode in which Chinese officials stormed out of a meeting with her and Barbara Woodward, a longtime diplomat and the British ambassador to China. She called it a testing time. The queen commented, They were very rude to the ambassador.The remarks were included in a video of the party that a longtime palace-approved pool cameraman recorded for the palace. The video was officially distributed to journalists and has been posted online.The BBC reported that there had been no official reaction from the Chinese authorities, but that coverage had been censored, with BBC World TV blocked in China during its report of the conversation.The British and Chinese governments have spoken of a new golden era of relations between the two countries. Mr. Xis state visit was supposed to symbolize the strengthening of ties, especially commercial ones. Mr. Xi posed for press photos with Prime Minister David Cameron at a pub in Buckinghamshire, England. The two men held pints of beer up to their lips.On Wednesday, Western journalists attending a regularly scheduled Ministry of Foreign Affairs news conference in Beijing asked a spokesman about the queens comments.The spokesman, Lu Kang, said that Mr. Xis visit to Britain had been extremely successful and that it had launched a golden era in relations. He also said he did not know of any threats by Chinese officials to cancel the trip.In June 2014, Premier Li Keqiang met with the queen at Windsor Castle. The Times of London had reported earlier from Beijing that Mr. Li and fellow Chinese officials had threatened to cancel his three-day visit to Britain if he did not get an audience with the queen. The Chinese are hard negotiators, an unnamed British government source told the newspaper.In 2005, Prince Charles sued The Mail on Sunday for publishing a private journal he had written eight years earlier that included candid remarks about Chinese leaders. He was writing about the British handover of Hong Kong to China, and he described senior Chinese officials accompanying President Jiang Zemin to the ceremony in 1997 as appalling old waxworks.Here is the transcript of the conversation on Tuesday:Lord Chamberlain: Can I present Commander Lucy DOrsi, who was Gold Commander during the Chinese state visitQueen Elizabeth: Oh, bad luck.Lord Chamberlain:  and who was seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese, but she managed to hold her own and remain in command. And her mother, Judith, whos involved in child protection and social work.Commander DOrsis mother: Yes, Im very proud of my daughter.Lord Chamberlain: You must tell your story.Commander DOrsi: Yes, I was the Gold Commander, so Im not sure whether you knew, but it was quite a testing time for me.Queen: Yes, I did.Commander DOrsi: It was, er, I think at the point that they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off, I felt thatThe Queen: They were very rude to the ambassador.Commander DOrsi: They were. Well, she was, yes, Barbara, she was with me and they walked out on both of us.The Queen: Extraordinary.Commander DOrsis mother: I know, its unbelievable.Commander DOrsi: It was very rude and very undiplomatic, I thought."}
{"text": "On a recent weekend in Times Square, a crowd at Carolines on Broadway nibbled on chicken salad and hamburgers. There were many empty seats, and the response to the opening acts was lukewarm. The air was thin with anticipation. Then a tornado hit.Rory Scovel, a comic in his mid-30s with an insincere smile and a scraggly beard, bounded onstage, fist in the air, chin jutting out, jauntily nodding his head and making faces as if he were doing a guitar solo for the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden. This triumphant pose seemed incongruous with the preceding mood, but what followed was the funniest set I have seen all year: a whirligig of characters and jokes, leaving the sleepy audience exhausted from laughter. The electric performance actually lived up to his entrance.Mr. Scovel  whose stand-up set The Charleston Special was released this year on video  has long been known as an improvisational experimentalist, the kind of comic who might do a bit in complete darkness or spend minutes in a thick German accent. Two years ago, I saw him do a quirky hour downtown, where he walked to the front of the stage, a stern look on his face. 9/11, he said, appearing solemn, then suspicious. When was it? Lets ask the real questions.His latest material highlights that same absurdist delight in transforming the deadly serious into utter nonsense, including another joke about paranoia about Sept. 11. Where my truth seekers at? he shouted before shifting into a whisper. 9/11 an inside job? Its deeper than that. Its not even a real date. Mr. Scovels more ambitious new hour is tighter, dense with jokes and delivered with the broad showmanship of a Broadway musical. Its the work of a cult star ready to move to the big rooms.But what makes him such a magnetic performer is not the content of his jokes.Mr. Scovel isnt particularly provocative or incisive about politics or social issues. When he brings up the election, he dismisses the whole thing with a flamboyant display of sarcasm. Preeeeetty good options, he says about the candidates, in the glibly knowing way someone might describe Michael Jordan as not that bad of a basketball player.If a comic says funny things, and a comedian says things funny, as the clich goes, Mr. Scovel is firmly in the second camp. He also looks funny, a deceptively ingenious physical performer who reveals his collection of goofy poses with the precision of a silent comedian. His deliriously silly comedy is less interested in engaging with the world than in creating its own. And yet  because Mr. Scovel often adopts the persona of a preposterously confident, thin-skinned egotist with a conspiratorial streak  his comedy does seem suited to the age of Trump.Its not his only character. In his kinetic act, Mr. Scovel shifts into a variety of Southern figures, including a would-be cool preacher and a rube. What all his buffoons share is a misplaced smugness and blinding lack of self-awareness. They bring to mind the puffed-up idiots played by Will Ferrell and the winking phonies Chris Elliott played in the late 1980s on Late Night With David Letterman.His quintessential impression is of a guy who lied on his rsum about being able to play the piano but still was hired to work in a hotel lobby. He barrels through a song, selling it with gusto, smiling, even though the tune is a cacophonous mess. When he returns to a version of the same guy on the job for a while, he has learned nothing except more salesmanship. The fact that nothing is going right doesnt stop him from acting as if everything were awesome.A more traditional stand-up set would be organized around these characters. Mr. Scovel is such an exciting live performer  and he really is one of those comics you need to see in person  because his improvisational instinct appears to be at odds with his own material. He is always looking to transform, even sabotage, his own set, veering off on tangents, interrupting, latching on to a phrase that tickles him, repeating it over and over until it becomes a kind of incantation whose repetition becomes its own bizarre joke.Comedy relies on surprise, but refining your jokes requires repetition; it follows that most of the best comedians are experts at faking freshness. Mr. Scovel does that nicely, but what really distinguishes him is that his commitment to going off script is greater than most. He searches out distractions the way an intrepid reporter digs up scoops.When a siren blared in the distance, he did not ignore it. He turned it into a bit and kept it on his special. At Carolines, he started playing with his zipped waist-length jacket, bundling it up by his chest and keeping it there through much of the set. It began as ridiculous, then started to seem normal when Mr. Scovel said that Kanye West was going to make this cool in a year. The biggest laughs in his set are in the transitions, not the prepared jokes.Theres an almost jazzy rhythm to his comedy, with his tangents integrated so seamlessly that its hard to tell whats planned and what isnt. The distinction becomes meaningless, because even with his most reliable jokes, he is constantly disrupting his own premises. In his new special, he does a long bit that begins, You guys ever use the bathroom at the grocery store? He told the same joke on Conan, but with a startlingly different pivot from this opening. Instead of treating his question as rhetorical, he darkened his mood in an instant to eyes-blazing rage: Answer me! he yelled at the audience, before apologizing for losing his temper.That this change of pace makes no sense matters less than that it is such a jarring surprise that you cant help laughing. Unpredictability is one of the most underrated virtues in comedy. Like a well-made suspense film, Mr. Scovels jokes have twists you dont see coming and the thrilling tension of a crackerjack plot where you have no idea what will happen next."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Obamas Visit Raises Ghosts of Hiroshima (front page, May 11):President Obama may be one of the most humane presidents we have ever had, and he should not hesitate to apologize for what we did to the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even though the White House insists he will not do so.No matter what the circumstances were, or whether Japan was about to surrender, incinerating thousands of innocent civilian men, women and children who lived in these cities on the premise that it could possibly save the lives of thousands of American troops in a future invasion cannot be judged as anything but grossly immoral.Some will cite diplomatic, financial or even face-saving reasons for the United States not to apologize. But I believe that President Obama has the moral compass and the courage to do it, and America would be the greater for it.ANNE MINICHNew YorkTo the Editor:There is no reason for an apology of any sort regarding the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Japan declared war on us by attacking the naval base at Pearl Harbor. Its conduct in the Pacific theater was, to say the least, a compendium of war crimes.To invade the homeland of an enemy that had sworn to fight to the last man, evidenced by its fanatical approach, would have resulted in incalculable losses. In such a scenario more Japanese would have died than did in Hiroshima.President Trumans decision saved lives, on both sides. No apology necessary  only the regret that such a weapon had to be used in the first place.RICHARD M. FRAUENGLASSHuntington, N.Y.To the Editor:I was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services over 70 years ago. I would, most likely, have been part of an invasion of Japan, had we made that choice. While President Trumans decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima may have benefited me personally, I was and still am horrified by our incineration of the city and the loss of so many innocent Japanese civilians.I applaud President Obamas visit to Hiroshima and his leadership in eliminating nuclear weapons from our world.BURT SHACHTERPompton Plains, N.J.To the Editor:Amid all of our nuclear posturing over the last half-century we seem to have forgotten that the United States is the only country to have ever actually used atomic weapons against other human beings. Perhaps at the core of our need to be the worlds policeman is the fear that others might one day make the same kind of coldhearted calculations that led us to do so.The world would be better served by a courageous self-examination of why we did what we did, and what the real effects were in terms of human suffering and loss of life. Historical amnesia propped up by the traditional narrative about ending the war is a recipe for destruction.Part of the process of coming to terms with the past would require great scrutiny of the decision to drop a second bomb, that one directly above hospitals and schools.(Rev.) TOM MARTINEZTempe, Ariz.To the Editor:The assertion that Japan was about to surrender has been a staple of revisionist criticisms of the atomic bombings. The claim is largely empty.Even though Hirohito and his military leaders were fully aware by the fall of 1944 that military defeat was inevitable, the emperor exhorted them again and again to fight to the death.The United States Army chief of staff, George Marshall, later concluded that the bombings effect was more psychological than military: It allowed Hirohito, fanatically obsessed with honor and imperial destiny, to surrender without losing face.STEPHEN BUDIANSKYLeesburg, Va.The writer, a military historian, is the author of Air Power."}

{"text": "Ben Carson, one of the earliest former rivals to endorse  Donald J. Trump, has a new role, according to a confidant: emissary from Mr. Trump to the remaining holdouts from the Republican primary field.The confidant, Armstrong Williams, said on Thursday that Mr. Carson had been placing calls and reaching out to everyone, and planned to make the case that despite Mr. Trumps insults in the primary race, the party needs to come together.The outreach would include Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, all of whom were frequent targets of insults from Mr. Trump during the primary campaigns.He can say, Hes done nothing to you that he has not done worse to me, Mr. Williams said, referring to Mr. Trumps mockery of Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, before the Iowa caucuses this year.Hope Hicks, Mr. Trumps spokeswoman, did not respond to an email about Mr. Carsons role.Mr. Carson, who endorsed Mr. Trump in March a week after ending his White House bid, has had multiple roles in the Trump campaign, including identifying potential vice-presidential candidates and as a go-between with Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, who met with Mr. Trump on Thursday in search of party unity.Mr. Carson stepped away from the committee vetting vice-presidential possibilities after it was reported on Tuesday that Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trumps campaign manager, would head up that operation, Mr. Williams said. He added that it was Mr. Carsons decision  not that of Mr. Trump or Mr. Lewandowski, who has been reported to be jostling with other senior advisers for primacy in the campaign.Trump wanted to give Dr. Carson the title of heading it up, but he didnt want it, Mr. Williams said, referring to the vice-presidential committee. He enjoys the freedom of having his life back and being an adviser.When the announcement came out of who was heading it up, it was a surprise, he added, referring to Mr. Lewandowskis role.The campaign has yet to formally comment on whether Mr. Lewandowski is heading the vice-presidential search, which was first reported by The Washington Post.Mr. Trump told The Associated Press after that report that a team of people on the campaign would be involved. Honestly, were all running it. Its very much a group effort, Mr. Trump told The A.P., adding in that interview that Mr. Carson would be involved.Mr. Williams, who is Mr. Carsons business manager, said that Mr. Carson gave Mr. Trump several names for vice president  but not his own. He is not interested at all in being vice president, Mr. Williams insisted.On Tuesday, Mr. Carson spoke by phone with Mr. Ryan to try to overcome the speakers hesitancy to endorse Mr. Trump. What Dr. Carson took his time to do was tell Speaker Ryan what a good listener Mr. Trump was, according to Mr. Williams.Mr. Carson maintained a mild manner throughout his presidential run even in the face of Mr. Trumps ridicule of his biography, parts of which Mr. Trump implied were concocted.The world laughed at him when he endorsed Mr. Trump, Mr. Williams said. And still, he was determined to unify the party.In reaching out to other defeated candidates, Mr. Williams said that Mr. Carson planned to argue that they should come on board to prevent a Democratic president from naming future Supreme Court justices.The toughest one is going to be Bush, he said.  But listen, that can change.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump boasted of his business success. He railed against political correctness. He insisted his opponents could not handle the tough guys, the bad guys the way he could.Oh, and one other thing.They dont look like Indians to me, Mr. Trump said of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, stunning a packed congressional hearing room by assailing the operators of the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. They dont look like Indians.The year was 1993, and Mr. Trump was maneuvering furiously to protect his casino business in Atlantic City from neighboring competition.But in that episode and several others since the 1980s, Mr. Trumps navigation of Washingtons corridors of power appears all too familiar in hindsight  fusing showmanship, a reductive approach to ethnicity, shape-shifting policy rationales and gleeful name-dropping into the political currency required to get what he wanted, or at least make headlines trying.As he sets off on a round of meetings this week to announce himself as the towns new Republican standard-bearer  most notably a sit-down scheduled for Thursday with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan  Mr. Trump can draw on decades of intermittent, but memorable, experiences.He is no Jimmy Stewart, wide-eyed and reform-minded. But not infrequently, Mr. Trump goes to Washington, making the short flight by jet to advance his business enterprises, hold forth on economics and charm lawmakers  including some future supporters, like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who seemed tickled by his visit in 2005.I want to thank you for your courage, Mr. Sessions told him, after Mr. Trumps swaggering testimony about proposed renovations to the United Nations headquarters in New York. (In critiquing the United Nations before Mr. Sessions and other Republicans, he was preaching to the choir.)In large measure, despite his self-styled reputation as a political outsider, Mr. Trump seems to have had little trouble fitting in  less a bull in a china shop than a New Yorker briefly on the wrong end of the Acela corridor.John A. Boehner, the former House speaker, became a golfing buddy. Lobbyists counted Mr. Trump as a client. And lawmakers came to recognize his tactics and recurring themes.Though a handful of Mr. Trumps excursions to Washington are well documented  his roasting at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011, his push to redevelop the Old Post Office into a luxury hotel  his forays into the arcana of congressional panels have received little attention during his presidential bid.During his stops on Capitol Hill, he foretold several campaign motifs: a frustration with the pace of government, scattershot policy prescriptions, predictions of impending doom.Before a House panel on the credit shortage in November 1991, Mr. Trump seemed irritated at times, calling changes in the tax code a catastrophe for real estate entrepreneurs and offering a bleak assessment of the economy and its stewards in Washington.I truly feel that this country right now is in a depression, he said. It is not a recession. People are kidding themselves if they think it is a recession. (The recession had actually ended the previous March.)Mr. Trump presented suggestions, including a tax increase on the wealthy to encourage investment.For high-income people, it should be raised substantially with the understanding that if you invest, you can get it down, and down substantially, he said. The incentive was taken away when the tax rates came down for high-income people.And in a flourish that has earned Mr. Trump some scorn from conservatives recently, he was critical of Reagan-era tax reforms, at one point suggesting the United States was no different than the Soviet Union.They have no incentive, and we have no incentive, he said. And if something isnt done to quickly put the incentive back, this country is going to be in very deep problems. It already is, but its going to get far worse.Mr. Trump and his ambitions were discussed from time to time by presidential aides as far back as the Reagan administration, and records show that he attended some White House events, though not frequently or recently. He attended a state dinner for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in 1985 with his wife at the time, Ivana.The next year, records from the Reagan Presidential Library show, Mr. Trump invited Nancy Reagan to be his guest at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. (She politely declined.)Mr. Trump was not shy about traveling to Washington to advance his own business interests.In 1985, Mr. Trump, as an owner of the United States Football Leagues New Jersey Generals, testified on the regulation of the National Football League, which he referred to as a great monopoly. (The U.S.F.L., which would soon disappear, had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L.)As his testimony wore on, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize the frivolousness of turning to Washington over a sports matter. With all of the problems of the country, it does seem strange that we are sitting here this morning talking about football, he said. But the fact is, it is something somewhat close to my heart.Mr. Trumps 1993 appearance before the House Subcommittee on Native American Affairs was perhaps his most memorable.An overflow crowd packed Room 1324 of the Longworth House Office Building, eager to take in a celebritys testimony. By the end, Mr. Trump had accused the committee chairman of having a totally closed mind, predicted one of the biggest scandals since Al Capone and ridiculed those who he said had played down the threat of organized crime in tribal gambling.That an Indian chief is going to tell Joey Killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me, Mr. Trump said.Yet at other times, Mr. Trump preferred to keep his distance, dispatching others to operate on his behalf during Beltway casino disputes.One lobbyist, Ronald Platt, who worked for Mr. Trump about 15 years ago on a tribal gambling matter, said he had been owed thousands of dollars in outstanding bills. Mr. Trump would not pay, Mr. Platt recalled in an interview. So he traveled to New York to collect.Mr. Trump, he said, was not pleased to see him. It is so prestigious down in Washington to represent me that you ought to be willing to do it for free, Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Platt.Mr. Platt replied with a profanity, he said, and Mr. Trump stormed out of the room.Eventually, Mr. Platt said, he got his check.Mr. Trump described the proceedings differently.I have no idea who he is, Mr. Trump said in a statement emailed by an aide, but if I held back payment, it was probably because he did a lousy job."}

Andrews cancer, however, a subtype of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), affects only about 45 children a year nationwide and is much more difficult to treat. The odds of surviving this type of AMKL are roughly even  unless the child is one of a handful who happen to have a particular genotype, in which case these odds plummet to a mere one in 10. Genetic analysis revealed that Andrew was in this tiny group.There was more bad news. Two weeks after the diagnosis, Andrews doctor, Norman Lacayo, an oncologist at Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital at Stanford University, received an urgent call from Michael Loken, the president of Hematologics Inc., a Seattle lab that was analyzing Andrews cells. Loken had recently discovered that a small percentage of children with AMKL had a specific phenotype  a pattern of proteins on the surface of the leukemia cell he called R.A.M. (a former patients initials)  that independently predicted a terrible outcome, with a survival rate of about one in six. Andrew had this phenotype too.Has anyone ever survived this kind of cancer? Dan asked Lacayo. All I wanted to know is that it was not impossible, Dan recalls. Lacayo said yes, but Dan felt his answer was foggy. The truth was that the team couldnt find a single equivalent case in the literature.Beginning on that December morning in 2014 when Esther took Andrew to the E.R., she recalls, she felt as if they had stepped into a horror movie, the unfolding events both surreal and evil. Up to that point, Esther and Dan had led, in her words, charmed lives  picture perfect. Only a small subset of people would sincerely say that nothing truly bad has ever happened to them; before the diagnosis, Esther and Dan say, they were among them. When Andrew got sick, they were in their mid-30s and energetic, optimistic and extroverted. They had both attended Stanford  Dan majored in industrial engineering, Esther in human biology, with a minor in dance  before going on to successful careers. Dan founded a sports-related start-up, then became vice president of small business at Facebook, while Esther worked at Kurbo, a start-up focused on weight management for kids, and taught spin classes at a Jewish community center for fun. Their own families were stable and close-knit; to recall any true adversity in either family, they had to think back to a grandmother of Dans whose family perished in the Holocaust.Once Andrews illness was diagnosed, he needed a bone-marrow transplant as swiftly as possible. First the doctors had to kill the leukemic cells in Andrews bone marrow with chemotherapy, then replace them with a donors cells. Andrews 3-year-old sister, Lea, and his 5-year-old brother, Wills, were tested, and in the familys first bit of luck since the diagnosis, Wills turned out to be a perfect donor match. Andrew underwent two rounds of chemotherapy, but there were still traces of cancer when the transplant was performed in February 2015, putting the outcome at high risk of failure.The Levys had created a Lotsa Helping Hands website, where friends signed up to host play dates or deliver meals (as did our family because our children were in the same school as Wills), and a Facebook group for updates on Andrews illness, which 1,700 people joined. But despite all the support, Esther felt deeply alone with the experience, she says. Her former life had vanished: She was living in Andrews hospital room, sleeping on a sofa that opened into a hard bed. She had left her job and the rest of her family while Dan continued to work and live at home with Wills and Lea. Her nights were punctured by Andrews cries; her days were spent frantically trying to distract him from his pain and nausea, cleaning up his vomit, holding him down during blood draws and making stressful medical decisions. He screamed if she left him for a few minutes, even to use the bathroom or shower.After Esther and Andrew spent three months in the hospital, the entire family moved into a nearby apartment, in order to live in a smaller space they could keep immaculately clean while waiting for Andrews new immune system to develop. Esther remained Andrews full-time nurse, responsible for a dizzyingly complex regimen of medications and sterile changes of the IV. A bone-marrow test that April showed no traces of cancer, and Andrew was considered to be in remission. They posted videos of him banging on his drums and singing with his toy Elmo and pretending to play golf.They decided that when Andrew was well enough, they would not return to their old home but begin a new life. They found a house in the nearby town of Atherton in the style of an English country manor, encircled by hedges and white rose bushes, that suggested privacy and safety. Andrew was too vulnerable to leave the apartment, so Esther could not go to see the house in person, but they bought it anyway, and she made plans with a decorator friend to create an airplane-themed room for Andrew.But on June 19, the medical team told Esther and Dan that there was bad news again: Andrews cancer had returned. The number of cells was small but would inevitably grow, the doctors explained. The team presented a new plan: They would begin chemotherapy again in preparation for a second bone-marrow transplant, perhaps using cord blood this time.Oh, God, Esther said, putting her head in her hands. She felt she could not go through it all again. And there was no reason to think it would work. The odds of success during the first transplant had been long; in a second attempt, they would be much more so. But the odds that it would cause all of us more suffering were 100 percent, she told me.From the initial diagnosis, Dan had determined that their goal was not simply to help Andrew survive but to keep the family intact. To choose to move back into the hospital, where they believed Andrew would die, was a fundamental violation of every promise we made to ourselves and our kids that we would be together again, he told me. He felt the family had just started to heal from the months of separation. The emotional scars of the experience, he said, would be irreparable if we ripped them open and split our family apart again. They decided to stop treatment. They would move to their new house, where Andrew would spend whatever time he had splashing in their swimming pool and playing in the grass with Wills and Lea.The doctors were stunned. We love you, and we love Andrew and were not ready to give up, Jennifer Willert, the pediatric oncologist in charge of the transplant, blurted out. Lacayo and Willert argued for at least trying some palliative chemotherapy to prolong Andrews life. Esther and Dan hesitated but ultimately declined. They called their decorator friend and told her to return the furniture for Andrews new room. She was one of the first people to whom they told the news: Andrew was going to die.The Levys posted the news of their decision on June 22. They explained their thinking and asked their friends not to question their choices, recommend new treatment options, tell them about Gods plan or insist that there was hope. I truly believe that I have a new way of looking at parenting  it is not about the length of life that matters, but the quality of life, Esther wrote. We are going to focus on quality.But quality time with a doomed child turned out to be impossible. The cancer cells were few enough that they were not yet making Andrew sick, but, Esther posted, I cant think of anything more painful than spending time with your precious baby knowing that he is going to die soon. Parenting is teleological; parents rear a child to become an adult. What were their goals for Andrew now? I am no longer raising him to grow up to be a wonderful human being, Esther wrote. Should she let him eat junk food or watch videos on the iPad all day? Did it matter?Their older kids asked tormenting questions. Lea wanted to know whether they could buy Andrew a certain toy when he was 4 years old like her. Wills wanted to know why they had Andrew if they knew he was going to be sick all the time.Dan read them Mo Willemss book Waiting Is Not Easy! about an impatient elephant. As he read, he thought about the waiting that had engulfed them over the previous nine months. They had waited to get the right diagnosis; they had waited 100 days for the transplanted cells to grow; they had waited for the results from the bone-marrow tests to see if the cancer was gone. Now there are no more diagnoses, Dan wrote on Facebook. No more tests. And no more milestones. But there is waiting. Maybe hours, or days, or weeks. This was the most agonizing of all: the wait for Andrews death.On July 1, they moved into their new house, and Andrew became sick. By the holiday weekend, he was moaning or screaming in pain whenever he was awake. Dan took a leave of absence from work. Esther held Andrew at all times, his body draped over hers on the couch or the bed. Dan took food to her because she couldnt hold him and sit up at the dinner table. Her hair began to fall out because of the stress. It was unbearable for him and for us, she says.The hospice team began to come every day to try to control the pain with high doses of opioids. Harvey Cohen, an oncologist and the medical director of the hospitals palliative-care program, explained to them that as the disease progressed, Andrew would not have enough platelets for his blood to clot. A hospice nurse told them to buy dark towels for Andrews crib, so that if he started to bleed uncontrollably, the sight would be less frightening for his siblings and for them.During the second week of July, the hospice team told them to prepare for Andrews imminent death. They called a rabbi, and thinking about how Andrew loved airplanes, they picked a Jewish cemetery near the airport. Not wanting him to be buried alone, they purchased grave sites for themselves as well. They established an Andrew Levy Memorial Fund to raise money for music therapy at the Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital.The members of their medical team visited their home to say goodbye. Andrew had stopped eating. He was barely moving, his breathing raspy and his complexion sallow, with the particular look the team knew from other dying children. Sometimes he stopped breathing momentarily, and his body would become rigid, and his face turn blue. Its O.K. for you to go, Esther told him. All she wanted now was for this to end quickly.They called Wills and Lea into the living room  a room the kids rarely entered. Esther pulled them close to her on the couch, and Dan sat on a cushion on the floor. They had rehearsed what they were going to say with Barbara Sourkes, a hospital psychiatrist with whom they had grown close, and they made an audio recording of this moment in case they needed to discuss it with her later.Dan told the children that the transplant had been a success, and that Willss cells had done a great job, but that Andrews cells needed to work on their own at some point, and they werent. His body is just not working, he said, as straightforwardly as he could manage.Is Andrew going to get better? Wills asked.The doctors dont think so, Wills. No.Sourkes had advised them to tell the children only what they needed to know so as not to overwhelm them, because the children needed emotional space to process things their own way. So Andrew  Andrew is going to die at some point, Dan said. We dont know when.I dont like that Andrew is going to die! Lea exclaimed and started crying.Wills pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his face and said he didnt want to talk about it.Andrew is going to die, so that means we are only going to have four people in our family, Lea said unhappily. She asked if they could get a new baby to replace Andrew, and she and Wills began to fantasize about a new baby who would make everything all better.Esther returned to Andrew. I promise, I promise you, we are not going to forget him, she said. You are always going to have a brother named Andrew because he is always your brother, now and forever.Andrews pieces of love will always be in our heart, Lea said, and then they all agreed to watch Mickey Mouse together.The vigil stretched on through the summer, and what they called mirages began to appear. In late July, Esther was sitting outside with Barbara Sourkes, holding Andrew and watching Wills shoot baskets. Suddenly Andrew sat up and reached for a ball and managed to throw it through his own little basketball hoop. Esther and Barbara were speechless.At first the mirages were brief  Andrew would laugh when Lea showed him her bellybutton or would stack blocks for 10 minutes  and then he would lapse back into pained lethargy for the rest of the day. But soon these episodes began to lengthen. For Esther, the mirages did not feel like miracles but evil tricks. She went through intense surges of anger. I felt like, How many trials are we going to have to endure? she says. Are we being spared nothing?Esther started sending the medical team videos. Andrew is eating pizza, Andrew is sitting up, Andrew is laughing, Lacayo, their oncologist, recounts. And we are like, What?In August, as the team struggled to account for what was happening, they theorized that in July, when everyone assumed Andrew was dying of cancer, he must have had a terrible infection instead, which passed. It didnt change the prognosis: The doctors stressed that, while Andrew might continue to recover from that infection as his new immune system took hold, the cancer cells were also growing and would eventually overwhelm him.After a blood test showed that his platelets were low, Cohen, the palliative-care doctor, urged them to accept transfusions to increase Andrews platelets so that, even though he was going to die, it would not be from bleeding to death. But at the hospital, it turned out, mysteriously, that Andrew had more platelets than at his last blood test, so there was no need for a transfusion that day. When Dan suggested giving him vitamins, Esther snapped at him. He seemed to be taking the anomalous blood test to mean Andrew was getting better, when, she says, I had no hope, and I needed not to have hope in order to function. And then they both apologized.In September, Andrew began to walk again, and his appetite and energy and dark curls grew. Dan decided to return to work. Andrew turned 2  a birthday his parents had never thought he would reach and knew would be his last. Esther recalls how friends urged them to enjoy every moment, and how she would tell them: No, this is hell, and it sucks. He is still going to die, so there is nothing joyous about this time.When they first got Andrews diagnosis, she told a night nurse that she just wanted to get her happy-go-lucky little boy back for a single hour. She had not understood then that any reprieve would only mean that they would have to go through losing him all over again  and each return will be harder than the last as Andrew grows and bonds with us, she wrote in a post.By October, Andrew was healthier than he had been in a year, running and playing ball with his siblings. None of the doctors had ever seen this kind of recovery before. They decided to bring him back to the hospital for a bone-marrow test.Michael Loken, who had analyzed Andrews blood work, had not been surprised that Andrews cancer returned. He had been working on a paper about R.A.M., the genetic marker that Andrew had. He had tracked 19 other cases of children with the phenotype; three years after the diagnosis, only two were still alive and healthy. When he examined Andrews marrow this time, using a sample of 200,000 cells, he got goose bumps. He repeated the test with 500,000 cells. Then he called Lacayo with the news. The cancer had disappeared.How could cancer spontaneously disappear? It does feel a bit like a miracle, says Jennifer Willert, the transplant doctor, echoing the sentiments of others. Noting the rare evocation of a concept that stands outside science, Loken says: It certainly defied our expectations with no discernible basis of happening. I guess this may be the definition of a miracle.The medical team grasped for a scientific explanation. Because Andrew had received no treatment over the summer, the answer had to lie in the bone-marrow transplant of Willss cells. Their main theory was that the infection that nearly killed Andrew in July had triggered a huge increase in his new white blood cells  and that heightened immune response had attacked not only the infection but the cancer cells as well.The doctors theorized that the response was partly a product of timing: The cancer had returned just as Andrews new immune system grew strong enough to destroy the cancer cells. A critical part of why transplants work is that some of the white blood cells, the T cells, that grow from the transplanted bone marrow will attack any lingering cancer cells, an effect known as graft versus leukemia. Chemotherapy rarely kills every last cancer cell, so it is believed that without graft versus leukemia, the cancer will eventually grow back. This is often spoken of as a model of so-called immunotherapy  stimulating the patients own immune system to attack cancer cells  which is widely regarded as one of the most promising avenues for cancer treatment.Willert had made a key decision to depart from Stanfords protocol to increase Andrews chances of getting a robust graft versus leukemia effect. Typically, a leukemia patient receives immune-suppressing drugs for at least 100 days (and often much longer) in order to avoid a serious side effect called graft versus host disease, in which new T cells attack not only the cancer cells but also the patients skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. The art of a transplant is said to be maximizing graft versus leukemia while minimizing graft versus host.Willert, who is now at the University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Childrens Hospital, had advocated a rapid early taper of Andrews immune-suppressing drugs on Day 60, as is the practice at U.C.S.F. and other places, because she felt that the benefits outweighed the risk of graft versus host. I fought for it because I have seen the power of getting rid of immune suppressants and letting the cells do their job, she says. After all, thats the whole point of a transplant!The final, critical decision was made against medical advice: Esther and Dans resolution to stop treatment and let Andrew die. Had they permitted more chemotherapy, the treatment would have killed Willss cells, which were what ultimately enabled Andrew to live.When you have a child with a life-threatening illness, you have an irrevocably altered existence, Barbara Sourkes had told the Levys, and Esther feels that is true. She had always felt in control of her fate, but now she believes this to be a fiction. She finds it difficult to reconcile bitterness over the blight of Andrews illness with gratitude for the reprieve. We are the luckiest of the unluckiest people in the world, she says. I truly believe that. The story presents itself to her as a riddle that cannot be resolved. She recalls her anger when others told them to hope. Is the lesson that their friends were right and there is always hope? Yet it was only by letting go of hope and accepting Andrews death that he lived.She has not returned to work. My full-time job is to help the kids feel safe again, she says. But it is hard for her to feel safe. The two years after a transplant are the riskiest time for a relapse; after two years that likelihood plummets, and after five years, a patient is considered cured. The two-year mark is still nine months away.There are only two states after such a diagnosis: disease and uncertainty, Cohen had told them. Either he will die soon, and thats certain  or he will continue on, and you will live with that constant balance of hope and fear. But the balance will change as time goes on.Only in the past few weeks, Esther says, has she been able to feel that she isnt testing fate by scheduling a dentist appointment for Andrew six months out or by feeling moments of joy watching him without being shadowed by fear of the future. Day by day, she says, we are allowing ourselves to celebrate a little more."}
{"text": "Most Fridays this semester, Sydney Greenberg, 19, would rush to her sorority house on the Tallahassee campus of Florida State University to arrive in time for lunch. The menu theme was Fried Friday, and Ms. Greenberg wanted to get at the massive bin of mozzarella sticks before any of her Delta Gamma sisters did.The goal: to get a perfect photograph of the fried cheese. Mozzarella sticks and mac and cheese are big winners for us, she said.Photographs of melted cheese (on pizza, noodles, chili fries) tend to be very popular on Freshmen15, the Instagram feed that Ms. Greenberg started about a year and a half ago with her five best friends from high school. A slice of pizza may rack up 12,000 likes. Cheese-smothered garlic bread gets 10,000.A photograph of a vat of the cheese sticks at Ms. Greenbergs sorority house, posted with the caption, I mozz-a-really start my spring break diet #freshmen15 # EEEEEATS garnered more than 6,700 likes. Freshmen15 has more than 130,000 followers, packing on more at a rate of about 1,000 a week.Our followers love cheese, anything with cheese, and the more melted and gooier the better, said Skylar Ganz, 20, who goes to John Jay College in Manhattan.Sure, Instagram is a destination for foodie fetishists, populated by posts of  vegan hot dogs, kale smoothies and perfectly sliced avocado fanned out upon seven-grain toast.But increasingly, in weeding through well-lit images of quinoa in ceramic bowls, Instagram surfers are enjoying a mounting backlash, with sites like Freshmen15 giving people an opportunity to celebrate an appreciation of Lucky Charms-infused Rice Krispies Treats and other kinds of fattening food that create anxiety and shame among people, women especially.(See also bread-facing: a social-media/performance-art meme in which people post videos and pictures of themselves as they rub their faces in carbohydrates.)Instagram accounts like Freshmen15 (tagline: We gain weight for a reason) focus on the joys of un-self-conscious indulgence. My friends and I try to embrace womens bodies for what they are, said Nikki Seligsohn, 20, who attends the University of Pennsylvania. We love going out to eat, we go for late-night pizza, we all love food.The six women decided to start the Instagram account on a lark, while they were still home in Boca Raton, Fla., before moving to different towns and cities. The idea was to stay in regular contact while sharing with one another the delicacies of college life.What they didnt expect was the way that strangers would gravitate toward their snaps of cookie-dough-covered birthday cake and baked macaroni and cheese. The women have become fattening-food aggregators of sorts, choosing photos to post (often about five a day) from food they come across themselves, other pictures they see on Instagram and images that are submitted to them.All six friends have access to the account and can post photographs they decide are worthy. On occasion, there is a dispute over an image. For instance, Joelie Fetterman, a 19-year-old at the University of Arizona, posted a photograph of a partly eaten ice cream cone submitted to her by a friend, but Ms. Greenberg deleted the picture from the Instagram feed.Joelie said, You deleted a picture that came from my big! Ms. Greenberg said (translation: a big is a sorority members mentor, or big sister).I said, If your big wants the ice cream to be featured on our page, she should have taken a picture before she started eating, Ms. Greenberg said.The feed has made the young women particularly popular among their college pals, with many of them submitting photos in the hope of being included. But photo quality trumps friendship.I try to be nice about it, but it can be awkward when you have to say to them, Sorry, but the cheese isnt melted enough, said Christina Aquilina, a 20-year-old who attends the University of Central Florida in Orlando. (Only Myar Taha, who attends Boston University, refrains from frequent posting. Im pre-med, so I dont have a lot of free time, she said.)There are perks. Ms. Ganz sometimes gets invited by restaurants to sample their menu free, and this winter she and a friend, Maggie Carlson, sat over prodigious plates of prosciutto and heaping bowls of mozzarella at La Panineria Italiana in Greenwich Village as they snapped photos, tasted sandwiches and talked feminism and body image.Ms. Ganz has struggled with eating disorders, and she believes the Instagram feed has been essential to her recovery. The very idea of broadcasting the fact that she is eating fattening food, via Instagram, seemed almost revolutionary.It used to be that I wasnt present when I was eating, I wasnt enjoying food, I was using my energy and focus on trying to stay skinny, she said. But I feel like things are shifting in our culture. Kale is over.Between bites of a cannoli, Ms. Carlson agreed. Everyone is fat in college, she said. I tell my sister, Dont even try to lose weight until grad school."}
{"text": "When the Attacca Quartets six-year survey of all 68 of Haydns string quartets ends on Thursday, the ensemble will have played, by its reckoning, roughly 32,000 measures of Haydn, lasting close to 24 hours.For this lively young quartet, formed in 2003 at the Juilliard School, it has been a very deep dive into the wellspring of its chosen genre. Haydn is often called the father of the string quartet, and even if some musicologists have cast doubt on his paternity by pointing to antecedents, his importance in creating the form cannot be overstated.He might not be the biological father, but he was the one who was there for us, at all our birthdays, Andrew Yee, the groups cellist, said with a laugh before a rehearsal for the concert at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Manhattan. Nathan Schram, the groups violist, agreed: His DNA is on just about every string quartet.It was Mr. Yee who came up with the idea of the marathon. He had taken to multitasking while walking his dog, Chopper, using the down time to familiarize himself with all the Haydn quartets he did not know. That was how he happened upon the slow movement of Op. 20, No. 3.Just in the middle of the walk, I broke down and started crying, there on the sidewalk, he recalled. I was like, Why dont I know all of these? So I called the quartet and asked if they wanted to play all of them.They did. And while other quartets have done their own cycles  there are recorded sets by ensembles including the Angeles String Quartet,  the Kodaly Quartet and the Aeolian String Quartet, among others  it was a still a bold move for a young group.In a sense, said Amy Schroeder, the Attaccas first violinist, the ensemble was overcoming its fears. As a young quartet, playing super-classical repertoire can sometimes be really daunting, just based on the amount of tradition, the amount of expectation, she said, recalling how early on, the group was alternately criticized for being too harsh or too Romantic in its approach to certain pieces.Attacca, which has been making a name for itself with recordings and high-profile engagements, including as the quartet in residence last season at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called the project simply The 68. It has performed the Haydn works over the course of more than 20 concerts at Holy Trinity, on the Upper West Side, with free tickets for students and a $20 suggested donation for others. The group played them in Canada, too, at the K-W Chamber Music Society in Waterloo, Ontario, where it wrapped up that cycle in March.One of the quartets on the program for the final concert on Thursday, Op. 76, No. 5, is among the few that was in the Attaccas repertoire before it began the journey, Mr. Yee said. Now, he added, it feels almost like a different piece.It was so amazing to play that opening bar  it couldnt have been more different than it was when we were much younger, he said. It was just like 100 pounds were lifted off my shoulders.As they rehearsed their final concert at the apartment of two supporters, Michael and Ann Loeb  playing chamber music in an actual chamber  the members seemed to have reached the place where words were almost extraneous. When they would occasionally pause to shape a phrase, confer on bowings or toss out thoughts, they seemed receptive to one anothers ideas and fast to incorporate them into their playing.After sixty-eight quartets, Mr. Yee reported, Haydn fatigue has yet to set in.You immediately just like him as a person when youre playing it, he said. And that element of the quartets never goes away. All the way through the late quartets, you still feel like afterward youd go out and have a beer with him.Ms. Schroeder was moved by another aspect. Who is more funny than Haydn? she asked.Mr. Schram, who joined the quartet later in the project, said that Haydn had been an ideal entree into the group. You cant  Im trying so hard not to use hide as a verb  but you have to be yourself when you play the music, he said. For me, it was a great way to get to know the players.Keiko Tokunaga, the second violinist, said that the lessons of Haydn would remain. Weve learned pretty much every single color that exists on Haydns palette, she said. Its really made us think about what we want to do with other composers as well.For its next project, Attacca will leap ahead several centuries to the present, as it embarks on a series called Recently Added at National Sawdust in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where it will play the complete works for string quartet by living composers, beginning with John Adams, Caroline Shaw and Michael Ippolito.Mr. Yee said that the group, its Haydn bona fides aside, was drawn to the new. The sort of lazy, obvious next step would have been Mozart, or Beethoven  which people would have loved, and we would have loved, of course, he said. But theres just so much good music happening right now."}

{"text": "New York City Ballet has been renewing itself at all levels in its current six-week season, which is now in its fourth week. Dancers in the corps have shown exceptional talent in lead roles, notably that zephyr Joseph Gordon in Symphony in Three Movements (seen on May 5), the tall powerhouse Emily Kikta as the soloist in Rubies, the impishly ebullient Indiana Woodward in the pas de trois of Emeralds (both May 1). On Tuesday, its senior ballerina, Maria Kowroski, returned to the stage after childbirth, almost a year after her last performance. Shes the same tall and slender vision as ever, but with a newly free expansiveness.And City Ballet has been renewing the ballets of its founder-choreographer George Balanchine. He made the three ballets Ive mentioned; he also made all three ballets in the triple bill that entered repertory last week. The three  Ballo della Regina, Kammermusik No. 2, and Vienna Waltzes, utterly unalike  comprise the richest fare of the whole season. The programs diversity and mastery astounds.Ballo (Ballet for the Queen), set to ballet music from Giuseppe Verdis opera Don Carlos, is virtuoso classicism, in which outgoing allegro technique is taken to an exceptional peak of exuberance. Verdis ballet depicts the discovery of the celebrated pear-shaped white pearl La Peregrina (which Richard Burton later gave to Elizabeth Taylor). The twist in Don Carlos is that, although the dance is intended to honor Queen Elizabeth of Spain, she has absented herself from the celebrations. Instead, the woman who presides over the operas dance spectacle is her lady-in-waiting, Princess Eboli (wearing the queens mask), who sings with excitement of her chance to be queen for a single night.Though Balanchines plotless blue-and-white ballet shows you no pearl and no princess, you can feel multiple layers of that drama evoked by the poetry of his steps: pearl-fishing through plashing waters, grand royal processions, exultance in the fleeting moment. Feet sparkle, arms stretch wide. We hardly know which element were in. A cavalier, immediately after promenading his ballerina, beats his legs in the air (a cabriole).Kammermusik, set to Paul Hindemiths Kammermusik No. 2 (1925), for piano and orchestra, is uncompromising modernism, intensely rhythmical and abounding in deliberate oddities. Unusually for Balanchine, the corps de ballet is all male and much of what Balanchine gives these eight men, often corresponding to the orchestra, is more unusual yet, consisting of crouches, tableaus and chains that become knots.Dancers often step on alternating heels or turn in their knees. Sometimes they bring their wrists in beside their shoulders, with hands pointing out sideways like spiky epaulets.Two leading male-female couples, often teamed with the solo piano, sometimes stationary while the corps moves, dance with intense musical intricacy. Rapid echo and canon effects abound. These four, too, plant their legs apart, prance on their heels, fold knees across each other, but at speed. The women wear their hair in ponytails, and the way those swish around their necks and faces is part of the texture of the piece.Vienna Waltzes is a panoply  a vast, composite world of five different scenes, to music by Johann Strauss II, Franz Lehar and Richard Strauss. In only one of the five do women dance on point. The changes in Rouben Ter-Arutunians scenery alone make the ballet a spectacle like no other.We begin in the Vienna woods, with tenderly romantic chivalry between male-female couples (GSchichten aus dem Wienerwald, or Tales From the Vienna Woods). We then pass through ballet entertainment (Frhlingstimmen, or Voices of Spring) and joyful non-waltz vulgarity (Johann Strauss IIs Explosions-Polka) and the formal flirtations of Gold und Silber Waltzer (Gold and Silver Waltzes). And the Rosenkavalier finale, one of Balanchines most poetically psychological dramas, is a dream-ballroom fantasy, in which a woman, in a long dance soliloquy, is repeatedly partnered by a man who may be her fantasy or an increasingly real suitor in whom she can scarcely believe.City Ballet has fielded two casts in all three ballets. No dancing has been poor; some has been outstanding. In Ballo (Sunday), Tiler Peck, that virtuoso, finds one of her very finest roles: while its bravura challenges her, its musicality releases her. In the Tuesday performance, Anthony Huxley was, as so often this season, dynamite in the male role. The four women soloists  notably Ashley Laracey in the first solo  beautifully caught the choreographys shining marriage of rhythmic flow and brilliant allure.Sara Mearns and Teresa Reichlen led Kammermusik on Tuesday with an uncompromising, thundering force. And yet the same two women were paragons of touchingly romantic old-world femininity in Vienna Waltzes on Sunday.  Ms. Reichlen in the Vienna Woods scene with Tyler Angle, Ms. Mearns in the Rosenkavalier ballroom with Jared Angle (Tylers brother). Ms. Kowroski graced the same scene with Amar Ramasar on Tuesday. Tiny nuances in these artists interpretations, such as the meeting of eyes, the touch of a hand, the turn of a head, became powerful.But you come out thinking of Balanchine. Astonishingly, these three ballets had their premieres between June 1977 and January 1978, in his final period. City Ballet was almost 30 years old. He was in his 70s. Top-quality choreography of immense diversity was still pouring forth from him. The bewildering range of styles in these three works demonstrates why he merits the word genius."}
{"text": "OAKLAND, Calif.  The playoffs feel different for the Golden State Warriors this time around. A year ago, the Warriors were talented upstarts, a team of long-distance cyborgs who were neither saddled with great expectations nor distracted by the spotlight of a history-making chase. It was fun and games.Now, the Warriors are the defending champions. A list of the records they have broken this season would require a spreadsheet. Nobody is mistaking them for anything other than what they are: one of the most dominant teams in the history of professional sports. All they need to do now is win another trophy.If the pressure is mounting on Golden State, the team is doing a good job of masking the emotional toll. On Wednesday, the Warriors took another step toward their ultimate goal by banishing the Portland Trail Blazers from the postseason with a 125-121 victory in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals.Stephen Curry, the N.B.As freshly re-minted most valuable player, sank a step-back 3-pointer with 24.9 seconds left before sealing the win with a pair of free throws.We had to fight and scrap and claw and do everything possible, Coach Steve Kerr said. Thats a tough team to guard and a tough team to play against.Curry finished with 29 points and 11 assists, and Klay Thompson scored a game-high 33 points as the Warriors won the best-of-seven series, four games to one. They will play the Oklahoma City Thunder or the San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals. The Thunder have a three-games-to-two series lead on the Spurs with a chance to advance Thursday night when they play Game 6.For the fourth straight game of the series, the Warriors trailed at halftime. And for much of the third quarter, they sought separation. But Shaun Livingston threw a pass out of bounds. Kerr slammed his hand on a courtside table. Draymond Green came up favoring his left ankle after he was fouled on a drive.But Thompson scored 16 points in the third quarter, and Curry drained a 3-pointer to give the Warriors a 2-point lead entering the fourth.Later, Andre Iguodala and Curry sank back-to-back 3-pointers to push the lead to 7. The degree of difficulty on Currys shot was advanced-level physics  a fadeaway 28-footer over the outstretched left arm of Ed Davis, a 6-foot-10 power forward. The Trail Blazers hung around behind Damian Lillard (28 points) and C. J. McCollum (27) before Curry emerged, as usual.It felt like we were running on fumes a little at the end, Kerr said.The Warriors overcame their share of obstacles through the first two rounds of the playoffs. Curry missed six games  two because of a sprained right ankle, four with a sprained right knee. After a two-week absence, Curry returned Monday for Game 4 and scored 40 points off the bench to lead the Warriors to an overtime victory.Before Wednesdays game, Commissioner Adam Silver presented Curry with the leagues Most Valuable Player Award for the second straight season. The Trail Blazers took in the festivities, which included a montage of Curry highlights on the arenas video boards. Curry, who wore gold sneakers, concluded his remarks by saying, Lets keep it going. The crowd cheered.It was not an easy series for the Warriors. They had to engineer a dramatic comeback to win Game 2. They lost Game 3. They needed overtime to take Game 4. They lost Andrew Bogut, their starting center, to a right adductor strain in Game 5. Along the way, the Trail Blazers bemoaned missed opportunities  opportunities that seldom materialize against the Warriors.That might be the closest five-game series of all-time, Thompson said.Trail Blazers Coach Terry Stotts said: I give credit to Golden State. Theyve got some remarkable players who can make big-time plays when they need it. Well learn from that.The Warriors stumbled again at the start of Game 5, falling behind by 10 points in the first quarter. Then, as soon as they took the lead, they gave it up once more, missing eight of their first nine 3-point attempts. With Curry struggling to unearth his rhythm, it was left to Thompson to keep the Warriors afloat.On one possession early in the second quarter, the Trail Blazers Allen Crabbe defended Curry as he crossed halfcourt, forcing him to give up the ball. But after Thompson slipped his defender on a screen, Green found him for a 29-foot jumper: swish. On defense, Thompson tried to make life difficult for Lillard, his primary defensive assignment throughout the series.Klay should be tired, Kerr said before the game. Hes probably one of the few players in the league capable of taking on the responsibility at both ends in a series like this  chasing around a dominant All-Star player at one end and taking on a big part of the scoring load at the other.Sure enough, Thompson was huge for the Warriors in the first half, scoring 17 points while shooting 7 of 8 from the field, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range.It wasnt perfect, Kerr said, but we got it done."}
{"text": "By design, what youre supposed to notice about all the employees of the Giuseppe Zanotti store is their shoes. A woman with a hard bob and a black suit looked as if shed dipped her feet in honey, then went for a walk on a broken mirror. A young man in quiet black wore the companys quietest black sneakers, still 50 degrees hotter than the rest of his outfit.One recent afternoon, though, I was drawn to the employee whose hair was louder than his shoes, both because he stood out and because of what he was doing with his time.He was polishing.I cant say if it was love, or a commitment to process  which is, lets face it, a kind of love  or a fear of failure, or a strategy of moving just deliberately enough that every second of the day will be filled with a task that requires presence but not attention.Whichever it was, it was mesmerizing  both for him, and to observe. And Ill be damned if everything in the store didnt just gleam. He used the same chamois cloth for the gold shoe stands and for the shoes themselves, which sparkled intensely, as is the Zanotti way. Glass and gold-trimmed shelving and mirrors alike were buffed to a sense of moral purpose.Others may have been catering to customers, fetching boxes from down below and handing out compliments to the Real Housewives of the East 60s, but it was this gentleman who epitomized what Zanotti is selling: razzle-dazzle, glitz, the hope that we may one day wear clothes that shout and wink on our behalf.Or return to the ethos of the 80s, which could happen. Zanotti specializes in a brazen, sexy vulgarity that was most at home back then, and that the company continues to add kerosene to, year after year. Its logo is a spiky signature, jammed onto handbags and belts, often rendered in gold. The stilettos are perilously high neon cages for the calf and foot. The sneakers are encrusted or inflated or riddled with zippers.Its the sneakers that have turned Zanotti into something of a global pest in recent years. At this point, the luxury sneaker has become almost trite, and thats partly because of Zanottis success. Liberated from the need to make sneakers performance objects, Zanotti has long used them as sites of play: gold buckle clasps, tiered outsoles, so many zippers.Not surprisingly, the visual tweaks are beginning to trickle up to actual athletic companies  or in at least one case, the exchange is reversed, with Zanottis fake Yeezy 750 ($895).But there is no sport here. All of the sneakers I tried on had the first-wear inflexibility of shoes, and the leather began to visibly crack with the first steps. I very much liked a pair of lemon yellow mid-tops, one zipper on either side of the tongue ($695), and I very much admired the gall it takes to make a pair of high-top sneakers secured only with one oversize puffy Velcro strap ($995). Both were like wearing huge pieces of candy on your feet. I would say theyd enliven even the dullest outfit, but theyre appropriate only when worn with the very opposite.Which is why, on the mens side, there were a few items of shiny but underwhelming clothing. A silver moto jacket in, I was informed, python print ($3,295), which made me breathe a sigh of relief for all the pythons allowed to slither on with their lives, but also explained the jackets cardboardy texture. On the next hanger was a pair of leather pants with horizontal slashes every few inches, and a GZ logo next to one slash, like a doctor who tattoos you after cutting you open ($1,995).The store is split down the middle: mens on the right, along with womens sneakers; womens high heels and sandals on the left; bags and other ephemera between the sections. Though this newly expanded space is twice as big as the old one at the same location, it still feels modest given the pomp of the shoes. You expect 30-foot ceilings, a water feature with laser lights, a statue built from shards of Miami Vice VHS tapes spray-painted glittery gold.But what the space lacks, the shoes deliver, time and again. There are high-tops with gold flames on either side ($1,250), flip-flops with chain accouterments, espadrilles with enough armor to render them beach-irrelevant. The flames on the mens sneakers were echoed on a particularly impressive set of heels, with four pairs of flames shooting up to the sky, or at least to the knee ($1,595).And even the most modest womans option here was a playhouse  a humble Teva-like sandal slapped onto a thick saw-toothed sole, with gold clasps astride it. It shined so brightly, even though no one asked it to."}
{"text": "Last summer, the great mass of the American political punditocracy scoffed at the possibility that Donald Trump would win a single state in the Republican race. Now hes all but certain to win the partys presidential nomination.Also last summer, British bookmakers took bets at 5,000-to-1 odds that Leicester City, a historically weak English soccer team, would win the Premier League. The team has won, and it has reportedly cost the bookmakers 25 million pounds, or $36 million, the biggest loss on a single sports event in British gambling history.Anyone can simply be unlucky. But there are systematic biases and errors our puny human brains tend to make repeatedly when we try to predict the future, some of which are evident in the biggest political and sports upsets of 2016.Its fine and well to make fun of people (including myself) who were sure that Mr. Trump had no shot at the presidency, or who offered overly generous odds to try to bring bettors into a betting parlor. Its even possible that those projections were correct  that these outcomes really were highly unlikely but that randomness prevailed (even a million-to-one lottery ticket might hit).But it seems more likely that the odds were misjudged all along. And if thats the case, understanding the mental errors behind those mistakes can be valuable for anyone who cares about forecasting and prediction (which, one way or another, is pretty much all of us).The biggest is recency bias, a concept most often evoked in financial markets by people who study the intersection of psychology and finance. We tend to overweight recent history in thinking about the likelihood that something might happen. People who have experienced a recent stock market crash are more likely to think another one is imminent, for example.That helps explain why, even when Mr. Trump entered the presidential race and rocketed to the top of the Republican polls, so many smart people remained so skeptical of the idea that he would win.Remember the 2012 Republican race, when a string of improbable candidates like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain briefly rose to the top of the polls, while Mitt Romney, who had the support of establishment donors, made a slow-and-steady path to the nomination. You could say the same of the 2004 Democratic race, when anti-establishment Howard Dean led in the polls for months but John Kerry won the nomination.But it hasnt always been that way. Wendell Willkie is the closest counterexample. Amid a divided Republican party in 1940, Willkie, a businessman who had never held public office and had been a Democrat just a year prior, emerged from nowhere to claim the Republican nomination. Barry Goldwater in 1964 was opposed by many Republican party leaders.And in English soccer, in the last 21 years, only four teams with big budgets and reputations  Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal  had won. But before that, there are examples of teams emerging to challenge the elite, like the 1995 champion Blackburn Rovers.Knowing history in other words  and not just recent history  can help a person avoid assuming that the way it has been recently is the way it always is.A related lesson is to be aware of just how small the sample is when looking to the past for guidance. American presidential elections take place every four years, and English soccer championships once a year. A basic lesson of sampling is that one should have less confidence in the results the smaller the sample is, which in turn implies great modesty about what might happen in the future.But its not just that the sample is small. Its also that in these games  running a presidential campaign or managing a soccer team  the rules are always changing. This is a version of what Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of The Black Swan, called the ludic fallacy. (Its derived from Latin for game.) The idea is that it is a mistake to apply the kind of simplified statistical model of a game to the circumstances of real life.In a game, the rules are fixed. If you spin a roulette wheel, or even send a baseball team out on the field to face an opponent, there are a set range of things that can happen, and its relatively straightforward to figure out the probability of each.But in politics, external events, media coverage, public opinion and the strategies of opponents  even the number of opponents  are constantly in flux in unpredictable ways. That means something that happened in a past year may or may not be good evidence for what will happen this year.And in sports, while an individual matchup might follow the usual rules of probability, a teams long-term strategy doesnt. A smart owner or manager can come up with new insights on how best to select and deploy talent that gives an edge over rest of the league that simple odds wont predict. Heres one analysis of the techniques Leicester Citys owners and managers used to prevail.Another example is the National Basketball Associations Golden State Warriors, who in the 2011-2012 season won only about third of their games. They had been to the playoffs once in 18 years. Relying more on 3-point shots than the rest of the league  with the help of Stephen Curry, of course  they rose to be last years champion and set the record for regular-season wins this season.Prediction is hard. Complex systems with constantly changing rules, a limited historical sample to analyze and our own psychological biases and short historical memories make it harder. And that has rarely been more evident than in the worlds of politics and sports in 2016."}
{"text": "The man with the parrot on his shoulder was preening as he examined necklaces before a vanitys mirror. The woman in a feathered dress was clutching a crystal on the floor.All around them, under a canopy of suspended couches, chairs and wicker baskets, expensively suited executives of Herms, the French luxury-goods company, were beaming. For this, the first major New York event dedicated to Herms Maison Universe  that is, its collection of furniture, tableware and decorative objets  delegations from the mother ship had arrived in force for the opening in Chelsea on Tuesday night.Herms has made furniture since the early 20th century, when it commissioned pieces by legendary designers like Jean-Michel Frank. But in recent years, it has expanded its furniture and design offerings, making a fuller collection to complement its leather goods, fashion and accessory collections.When we came to Herms, we asked ourselves: What is a design for Herms? Is it the Kelly, or the scarf? asked Charlotte Macaux Perelman, who, with Alexis Fabry, took over as deputy artistic directors of the Maison Universe in 2014. We think there are many different values at Herms. The home department should generate the same values.To stage those values, as well as amp up the fantasy, they called in Robert Wilson  Bob, to cognoscenti  the avant-garde theater director, who is a master of the surreal and the inexplicable. He has long been lionized in Europe, though despite classics like Einstein on the Beach, with Philip Glass, American audiences have largely been slower to embrace his oeuvre. When he staged an early production, Deafman Glance, a seven-hour silent play in New York, as he recounted in an interview published by Herms, the reception was pretty mediocre. (In France, it was hailed as a triumph.)For Here Elsewhere, his collaboration with Herms, which will be shown privately this week, to the interiors trade as well as to artists and curators, Mr. Wilson called upon familiar collaborators. The woman on the floor with the crystal was Meg Harper, who danced for Merce Cunningham and has appeared in Mr. Wilsons works since 1998. The kohl-eyed ingnue doing static, deliberate movements inside a frantically spinning carousel of digital images on Herms themes (Change! Faster! Mr. Wilson bellowed in a rehearsal the day before the opening) was Brittany Bailey, who completed a residency at Mr. Wilsons Watermill Center in 2014.It is an unusual way to exhibit these objects from the first collection Ms. Macaux Perelman and Mr. Fabry oversaw for Herms (and which had a more traditional outing at the Salone del Mobile, Milans furniture fair, last month), but for a traditional company, Herms has proved very willing to embrace the unexpected in its collaborators, and even its hires, like Ms. Macaux Perelman and Mr. Fabry. She is an architect by training; he, a publisher and specialist in Latin American photography.I think Herms likes not to use people for the obvious, he said. Were typically people who would never be where we are if a headhunter had come to find us.How best to appreciate the spectacle was also not necessarily obvious, at least for those who assembled for one of its opening-night sessions.I wasnt sure if we were supposed to follow the little pig man, one visitor was overheard saying doubtfully.We were. Past the suspended couch and through the frenetic carousel (where Ms. Bailey and Kayije Kagame, another dancer, took turns undulating in slow motion), Carlos Soto, a short gentleman with a pigs nose and a spangled, matador-style outfit, giggled and led guests to a final room, pink-walled and filled with soap bubbles.It was the exit.Thats all folks! he bleated into a microphone, channeling that other great porcine performance artist, Porky. Thats all there is! Dont yall have dinners to get to?"}
{"text": "It looked like the makings of dinner at a yoga retreat. There was a sheet pan filled with cherry tomatoes, glistening with olive oil, dusted in lime zest, showered in salt and pepper. Beside it, another pan: a soy-drizzled mound of ripped kale and dried shaved coconut. There were the ingredients for a dressing as well: miso paste from Japan; tahini from the Levant; local honey; a knob of ginger; a bright red pepper. All of this was very beautiful. But I didnt see how it was going to come together.It did. Those tomatoes were roasted, along with the kale, and they converged under the dressing to create an excellent, powerfully flavorful dish  exactly the sort of salad to raise a dinner party or family meal high. You could serve it as a starter course, in advance of some grains, or soup, or a roast. On a weekend, it could be a terrific lunch. You may want to make it all the time. (I do.)The recipe comes from Anna Jones, a British food stylist who worked for Jamie Oliver before striking out on her own. It appears in her first cookbook, A Modern Way to Eat, a collection of recipes that, if you spend as much time as I do snooping around peoples kitchens, seems to be shaping up as a kind of new-era Silver Palate Cookbook. (This salad could be Joness chicken Marbella.)When I write a recipe or cobble something together for dinner, Jones writes in the books introduction, I always have three things in the back of my mind that shape my cooking: How will this taste? How can I make it more interesting to eat by layering up the textures? And how can I make it look the most beautiful on the plate?These are good questions, in their way. Of course the first is what the entrepreneurial class calls table stakes; your cooking had better taste good. And the third is perhaps more a symptom of a world obsessed with photographic documentation than one concerned with deliciousness. But Joness second question is vitally important, particularly in salads, where the layering of textures is what differentiates the great from the merely good. You want crisp and yielding, slick and crunchy and soft, all at once.So I roasted the tomatoes until they were almost but not quite melting. The heat concentrated their flavor, and the lime accented it beautifully. The kale joined them in the oven for the last 10 minutes or so. Cooked without oil, the greens went soft in parts and crunchy in others, and the soy and coconut bracketed their pure mineral intensity. For the dressing, I whipped together the ginger, miso, tahini, honey, olive oil, lime juice and chopped hot pepper to create a mixture far thicker than vinaigrette  one that lent itself better to drizzling over the bowl than using as something to slick every green. It is dressing as paint, perhaps, both creamy and bold. (You can thin it out a little with extra lime juice.)The combination  the layering up, in Joness phrase  is sublime. You could certainly toss everything together, but I think the dish works better as a kind of tableau: the greens assembled across the bottom of a bowl or platter, with the tomatoes dotted across them along with the strips of shaved coconut, and the whole thing dressed simply, without tossing, the miso-tahini mixture added as you might apply pieces of mozzarella to a pizza. People will mix everything together on their own, on their own plates, as they eat.Regardless, and pleasantly, there is no need to rush the preparation. You can assemble the recipe serially, slowly. The greens and the tomatoes come out of the oven hot. They can be served merely warm, and indeed should be. I know that food cooked with calmness and a little grace, Jones told The Guardian a few weeks ago, tastes, to me, a little better than when Im running around doing 10 million different things. Which is true as north, though generally hard to achieve. Here is a chance now. Take it.Recipe: Warm Kale, Coconut and Tomato Salad"}
{"text": "West Virginia turned on Hillary Clinton.In 2008, when running for the Democratic nomination against then-Senator Barack Obama, Clinton won every county in the state, carrying it by a whopping 41 points.Clinton said in 2008 during her West Virginia victory speech that no Democrat had won the White House since 1916 without taking West Virginia. What she didnt say was that they all could have won without it. The margins of victory in those races ranged from 23 to 515 electoral votes. West Virginia has five.That is precisely what Obama did. He won the election in 2008 without winning West Virginia, and he was re-elected in 2012 without winning even a single county in the state.The Hill reported this week that, according to a political-science professor at a West Virginia college, West Virginia voters were so fiercely anti-Obama that they voted in large numbers in 2012 for his primary opponent, who was a jailed felon in Texas.This cycle, a major part of Clintons strategy has been to so closely align herself with President Obama that there is very little light between them. This helped her secure and retain some minority voters, but most likely distanced her from many white ones.On Tuesday, Clinton lost every county in the state and trailed Bernie Sanders by nearly 16 points.So whats going on in West Virginia? First, it is one of the whitest states in the country, and the absolute whitest in the South. It is also the least educated state and one of the poorest.As of 2014, almost 94 percent of its citizens are white, only 18.7 percent have attained a bachelors degree and 17.2 percent fall below the poverty threshold.West Virginia is the only state wholly contained in Appalachia, a collection of counties that stretches from Mississippi to New York and covers portions of swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina. This region has been trending away from Democrats in recent elections. Obama won fewer than 30 of Appalachias 420 counties in 2012; he won 44 in 2008; John Kerry won 48 in 2004; and Al Gore won 66 counties 2000.West Virginia is also heavily reliant on the coal industry, which is at odds with liberal clean-energy initiatives.In an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle in 2008, Obama said of his proposed energy plans:Bankruptcies aside, the Obama years saw a steep decline in coal production in the state. According to a report published by West Virginia University, After climbing to nearly 158 million short tons in 2008, the states coal mine output has tumbled in each successive year to an annual total of approximately 115 million short tons in 2014  or a cumulative decline of 27 percent.This was the right long-term clean-energy approach, but it hit a sour chord in West Virginia.True to her Obama-emulating form, Clinton took a similar tack this cycle when she said during a CNN town hall:Again, smart long-term policy, but doesnt sit well in West Virginia. Clinton recently apologized for the misstatement, saying, I dont know how to explain it other than what I said was totally out of context for what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time.But the apology was too little, too late for voters in West Virginia.West Virginia illustrates the danger that accompanies the Clinton strategy of closely aligning with President Obama and his policies: Many white voters, particularly white men, detest him. Many on the right think he went too far and many on the left dont think he went far enough. The populist movements at both ideological extremes are to some degree anti-Obama movements.As ABC News reported Tuesday about preliminary exit polls in the state, the highest level of economic concern in any Democratic primary this year and greater-than-usual turnout among men, whites, political independents and critics of President Obama characterized Hillary Clintons challenges in the West Virginia primary.In 2014, Gallup reported on the depths of this problem for Democrats in general:These white non-college graduates are a strong base of support for Donald Trump, who exclaimed in Nevada, I love the poorly educated. Apparently, the feeling is mutual.If Trump has a path to the presidency, it will most likely be because of Clintons  and Democrats  weakness among people who look an awful lot like the voters in West Virginia."}
{"text": "Collective Sigh(Don Giovanni)For this, you dont need perfect pitch or a lyric sheet: Pinkwash makes music in the key of catharsis. Collective Sigh is the Philadelphia duos first full-length record. It has 10 tracks but feels like one long double action of anguish and stomp. It suggests post-post-hardcore, or maybe punk-prog, with the punk first.The bands sound carries its own information, and to explain its biography and its name risks eclipsing the work. But it has been supplied to the news media, so here you go: Joey Doubek, the singer-guitarist, and Ashley Arnwine, the drummer, played in the band Ingrid when they both lived in Washington. During that time, Mr. Doubeks mother became ill with breast cancer, and he became her primary caretaker. She died in 2009. Both musicians eventually moved to Philadelphia and started Pinkwash. The name alludes to the practice of corporations that promote their products with the iconography of pink ribbons in sympathy with breast-cancer patients; it also refers to the co-opting of L.G.B.T. interests for public-relations purposes by politicians or corporations.In Pinkwash, Mr. Doubek writes repeating guitar riffs splintered into shifting or alternating meters; he has hundreds of them, all strong. (Placid, Gary Numan-like synthesizer tones float over the songs here and there, offsetting the churn.) Ms. Arnwine plays rugged drum patterns against those riffs, adding little accents to the groove, smashing her cymbals nearly all the way through.A lot of what she does  the details, the elegant ferocity  traces back to John Bonham of Led Zeppelin; the unrelenting fever of a Pinkwash song, and the yelping tone of Mr. Doubeks vocals, recalls the 1990s band At the Drive-In. The record is wearying, as so many guitar-drum duo bands are wearying. But the band has grown surer and more stately since its previous work, the 2014 EP You Cure Your Soil and the enraged 2015 single Cancer Money.These songs are carefully composed, culminating in the records magnum opus, Walk Forward With Your Eyes Closed. The lyrics suggest pain, illness, exhaustion, the struggles of the body and the question of who takes care of the caretaker: Youre metastatic/youre spreading in plain sight, or empty appetite/to make it through. One song, Sigh, has almost two and a half minutes of a single repeated low note, with the only vocals that dont come from Mr. Doubek: It could be the voice of a nurse, repeating Inhale. Exhale."}
{"text": "In his latest play, White Guy on the Bus, Bruce Graham takes the audience for a ride that starts easily but then makes an unexpected turn into some bumpy territory.A frank stare-down at racial perceptions today, this 2015 drama fits the artistic mission of Passage Theater Company, which aspires to produce socially relevant new works that offer diverse perspectives on complex issues.That is certainly what Mr. Graham boldly delivers in the New Jersey premiere of his entertaining and thoughtful play at the Mill Hill Playhouse in Trenton.The story, which happens in inner-city Philadelphia and its elegant Main Line suburbs  and also aboard a bus that links them  centers on Ray (Greg Wood), a well-to-do financial manager in his handsome middle years.Ray is cozily married to Roz (Susan Riley Stevens), who teaches English at a public school in a hardscrabble urban district. They are very nice white people of a liberal, cultured bent, and so is Christopher (Nate Washburn), their surrogate son, and Molly (Laura Chaneski), his recent bride.As these four sip wine on a veranda, Roz talks wryly about the racial hostility in her predominantly black-populated school, where students often call her a white bitch to her face. Christopher, meanwhile, eagerly chats about developing a doctoral thesis on male African-American images in television advertising.This conversation is relatively light, as are the subsequent scenes that detail how Christopher became part of the older couples life, how Ray is an executive who takes pride in his analytical skills and how Roz is helping a 10th-grader learn how to read.Sandwiched between these suburban episodes are scenes aboard a grimy city bus where Ray strikes up an acquaintance with Shatique (Danielle Lene), a young African-American woman. She is a nursing student and a single mom who lives in a sketchy neighborhood. As Ray and Shatique become friendlier during the course of some weekly rides together, it is gradually revealed that their destination is a prison where her brother is an inmate.What is this well-off guy doing on the bus? Does he have a client there? Or is it possible that Ray, a seemingly contented husband, is interested in seducing Shatique?The major twist that comes in the closing scene of the first act is shocking.It forces audience members to recalibrate everything that they have witnessed so far. It ratchets up the drama to deadly serious heights in the second act that might seem melodramatic were it not for the legitimate points that the story and the dialogue raise about human nature and racial prejudice.Although the play grants a happy ending of sorts to several characters  a poignant one, to be sure  it remains an unsettling study in cultural disaffection that is likely to spark discussions afterward.Mr. Graham, the Philadelphia-based author of more than 20 plays as well as numerous television and film scripts, is proficient in creating conversational dialogue and believable characters. He smoothly establishes Ray as an engaging protagonist before revealing his ruthless nature and gives Roz a brittle yet upbeat personal charm. He depicts Shatique as a kindly woman with an upright conscience. The younger couples presence provides a humorous counterpoint that looks at racism from various angles of ultra-political correctness.Swiftly structured by the playwright in slightly overlapping scenes, the drama receives a production that is fluidly staged by Michelle Tattenbaum, the director. Jeffrey Van Velsors set design, which is austere in looks but flexible in function, neatly handles the storys demand for various locations.The actors ably project their characters. Ray is perfectly gentlemanly until he suddenly isnt, and Mr. Wood plausibly shifts the mans gears from neutral into raging overdrive and back down again. Ms. Stevens lends Roz an air of breezy humor that eases her sharper remarks. Ms. Lene nicely grounds Shatique with personal warmth and a solidly moral sensibility.Everyone who sees White Guy on the Bus will probably recognize the hard truths about racism that drive this story  and, sadly, so much of American life today."}
{"text": "Morley Safer, the longest-serving correspondent on 60 Minutes who was known as much for his hard-hitting reporting as the quirky stories he covered, will formally retire this week after a career in broadcast news that lasted more than 50 years, CBS said on Wednesday.Mr. Safer, 84, served on 60 Minutes for all but two of its 48 seasons. He started scaling back his appearances on the show after he turned 80; his last segment, a profile of the Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, aired in March.His first season as a regular correspondent on 60 Minutes began in 1970 with a report on the training of federal sky marshals. In total, he did 919 reports for 60 Minutes.If you look at any one of them, you will find they are all beautifully written, Jeffrey Fager, executive producer of the show, said in an interview on Wednesday.I think hes a model and always has been about what a reporter should be, said Mr. Fager, who described Mr. Safer as a gifted storyteller. Its about curiosity and the sense of adventure. That really came across in his work.Mr. Safers report in 1965 about American soldiers torching the homes of villagers in Cam Ne, Vietnam, was among the top 100 works in journalism of the 20th century in the United States chosen by New York Universitys journalism department.An hourlong program on Sunday, Morley Safer: A Reporters Life, will, among other highlights, recall an investigation by Mr. Safer that resulted in the freedom of Lenell Geter, a black man who was wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison in Texas. In an appearance on the special, Mr. Geter credited Mr. Safer with saving his life.While he tackled serious topics, Mr. Safer was also known as a quirkologist for his offbeat stories, such as Tango Finlandia, about the affection Finns had for the sensuous dance, and about Marfa, Tex., a community that enjoyed a renaissance by blending artists and cowboys.He also interviewed entertainment luminaries, such as Jackie Gleason, Katharine Hepburn and Dolly Parton.The program on Sunday will feature a retired United States brigadier general, Joe Stringham, who commanded a Green Beret unit that Mr. Safer accompanied into battle in Vietnam. The general recalled Mr. Safer as being all business, We looked at eternity right in the face a couple of times and he was as cool as a hog on ice.Mr. Safer was not doing interviews with the news media on Wednesday, and in the coming special on Sunday he reveals that he did not really like being on television, according to CBS.It makes me uneasy, he says. It is not natural to be talking to a piece of machinery. But the money is very good."}
{"text": "In late January 1948, Tennessee Williams arrived for the first time in Rome, a city that the playwright, then 37, would quickly call the capitol of my heart. After more than a decade toiling in poverty and obscurity, Williams had been catapulted to national fame three years earlier when his loosely autobiographical memory play, The Glass Menagerie, became an instant critical and commercial hit. Its follow-up, A Streetcar Named Desire, opened in 1947 to packed Broadway houses and rave reviews, cementing Williamss position as a major figure in the American theater establishment. Four months later, he set out for Europe.After a brief, disappointing stopover in France (I found nothing very good about Paris but the quality of the whores, Williams wrote his friend and longtime collaborator Elia Kazan), Rome won him over instantly.As soon as I crossed the Italian border my health and life seemed to be magically restored, he wrote in his memoirs. Williams spent much of the next decade in Rome, which became the backdrop and inspiration for one of his most personally and creatively fruitful periods  as well as the setting for his 1950 novella, The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. Despite recurring bouts of writers block, when the sensitive, melancholic playwright found himself battering my head against a wall of creative impotence, he wrote many of his greatest works here, in whole or in part, including Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Rose Tattoo and Baby Doll during numerous extended visits to the city.To search for Williams in todays Rome is to explore the vestiges of that heady, messy period after the fall of Mussolini but before the so-called Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s. When he arrived in 1948, the newly open city was the epicenter of a just-dawning golden age of Italian neorealist cinema. The dollar was strong, prices were low, and, as Williams put it, an Americano could get away with a whole lot.Williamss first place of residence was a top-floor room at the Ambasciatori Palace, a grand neo-Renaissance hotel along the tree-lined Via Veneto. Today, like many of Williamss former haunts, both the boulevard and the hotel feel somewhat past their prime. Via Veneto is still upscale, but its touristy trattorias and chain hotels would be sadly ill-fitted to its former incarnation as the glorious main drag of La Dolce Vita, the 1960 Federico Fellini classic. Still, despite its depressing subterranean breakfast buffet, the Ambasciatori retains a faded elegance that makes it easy to imagine the looks of disdain Williams recalls receiving when, on his second night in the city, he brought home a raggedly dressed Roman teenager whom he calls Raffaelo in his memoirs.For Williams, Rome offered freedom  an escape from the puritanism that plagued his life back home. In a 1949 letter to his publisher, Jay Laughlin, Williams recounted a dinner with Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini shortly after the Hollywood star and the Italian director had begun their highly publicized collaboration and extramarital affair. Their indifference to the scandal, he wrote, is very beautiful and should have a salutary affect on discrediting those infantile moralists that make it so hard for anyone to do honest work and live honestly in the States.Williams wasnt alone in this assessment. His social circle at the time included the poet Frederic Prokosch, Truman Capote, that unhappy young egoist Gore Vidal and a number of other American writers and artists who, like Williams, were gay or bisexual, and had found in Rome a degree of creative and personal freedom unheard of back home. They also tended to share another of Williamss well-known traits: a love of drink.The American colony is desperately gregarious and you can only work by bolting doors and shutters, he wrote to his agent and close confidant, Audrey Wood. Yes, some of them even climb in the window if they suspect you have a little cognac on the place! In addition to giving house parties, Williams and his friends frequented Via Veneto spots like the Caf de Paris, Rosati and the downstairs bar of the Hotel Flora (now the Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora).By now an international celebrity, Williams made regular appearances in the Roman society papers. Yet his fame was still not such as to prevent him from engaging in another activity of which Rome offered manifold new possibilities: cruising.In the evenings, very late, after midnight, I like to drive out the old Appian Way and park the car at the side of the road and listen to the crickets among the old tombs, he wrote to the actress Jane Lawrence Smith. Sometimes a figure appears among them which is not a ghost but a Roman boy in the flesh!The nightingales busted their larynx! he wrote to the poet Oliver Evans of a dalliance with a Neapolitan professional lightweight boxer he picked up on one of his first nights in Rome. I wish I could tell you more  details, positions, amiabilities  but this pale blue paper would blush!After the Ambasciatori, Williams moved into a two-room apartment in a tawny old high-ceilinged building just outside the Villa Borghese gardens at Via Aurora 45. There he would reside for much of his time in Rome, mostly with his longtime partner Frank Merlo, who accompanied Williams on many extended trips in the capacity of his secretary. The building on Via Aurora has since been leveled, and today the lot is occupied by a generic taupe-and-glass office tower housing an Italian subsidiary of the BNP Paribas banking group.So much of the Rome Williams knew and loved  the swinging, free-spirited Rome of the 1950s and 1960s  is long gone, paved over by anesthetized chain stores, tourist traps and bank branches. Some spots remain in name only  like Doney, a sidewalk cafe on Via Veneto that is now a bland extension of the Westin Excelsior hotel, of which the main clientele appears to be traveling businessmen and their bored-looking female companions.But in Williamss day, Doney was a place of singular intrigue and energy, a recurring setting in his recollections and correspondences. In a 1948 letter heralding the arrival in Rome of The New Yorker correspondent Janet Flanner and her all-female entourage, Williams tells Gore Vidal that the social life is considerably better than when there was just us girls, sunning ourselves like a bunch of lizards on the walk in front of Doneys. In another letter to The New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson, he recalls passing the cafe and seeing Orson Welles, presumably in town for the filming of the 1949 film Black Magic, sitting alone and reading a book called DECADENCE.It was also at Doney that Williams had his first meeting in 1950 with the legendary Roman actress Anna Magnani, whom he had in mind to play the widow Serafina in The Rose Tattoo.The long-awaited meeting with Magnani has finally occurred, he wrote to the theater producer Cheryl Crawford. After keeping him waiting for 45 minutes, Magnani sent a messenger to bring him to Doney. She dominated the whole street, he wrote. Her figure is the very meaning of sex. Her eyes and her voice and style are indescribably compelling.This meeting would prove the beginning of a decades-long collaboration and friendship that would profoundly influence both of their lives. Williams and Magnani, both temperamental artists who were fearless in their determination to live unconventional lives, had a deep understanding of each other, and beyond the roles he explicitly wrote for her, from 1950 on, Williamss female characters began to resemble Magnani: passionate, sexually vital, complicated and self-confident.Throughout the 1950s, Williams, Merlo and Magnani spent countless nights on her terrace above the Piazza Minerva overlooking the Pantheon and at fashionable venues like Rosati, which is still a pleasant place to people-watch over Negronis.They also made frequent appearances at Alfredo, the restaurant credited with inventing fettuccine Alfredo that today has two self-styled inheritors: Alfredo alla Scrofa, at the original location, and Il Vero Alfredo, run by the original proprietors descendants. Both of todays Alfredos, sadly, are touristy and overpriced, though Il Vero is almost worth a visit for the hundreds of framed photos of the owners mock-feeding giant handfuls of fettuccine to celebrity visitors whose expressions range from hammy complicity (James Stewart, Sylvester Stallone) to perturbation bordering on panic (Peter Sellers, Sophia Loren).But if Williamss recollections of a glamorous 50s bohemia seem sadly obsolete, his lyrical descriptions of the city feel abidingly apt, as in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, when he describes the moment before the lamps go on, when the atmosphere has that exciting blue clarity of the nocturnal scenes in old silent films, a color of water that holds a few drops of ink. Or as in the novellas opening passage:At five oclock in the afternoon, which was late in March, the stainless blue of the sky over Rome had begun to pale and the blue transparency of the narrow streets had gathered a faint opacity of vapor. Domes of ancient churches, swelling above the angular roofs like the breasts of recumbent giant women, still bathed in golden light, and so did the very height of that immense cascade of stone stairs that descended from the Trinita di Monte to the Piazza di Spagna.*For Williams, Rome possessed a singular mix of ephemeral grace and gaudy eroticism, softness and sex, that made it the ideal setting for the story of Karen Stone, a wealthy, recently retired American actress in the midst of an existential crisis (whose story, incidentally, could easily be seen as a superior, darker progenitor of the current retiree travel romance genre in the vein of Under the Tuscan Sun).Mrs. Stones feelings of drift, of lostness, her impression that she was now leading an almost posthumous existence, echo sentiments expressed by Williams himself. Like him, she found in Rome a place to disappear.At one point in the novella, Mrs. Stone sits in the back of a car as it twisted at random among the devious ways of the Villa Borghese and had a sense of arrival. This was the center. This was what the frantic circle surrounded. Here was the void The years after his golden time in Rome were not particularly kind to Williams. Much of his later work was ignored by the public and panned by critics. Many close friends died prematurely, including Merlo and Magnani, who succumbed to cancer, he in 1963 and she in 1973. Returning with decreasing frequency to the Italian capital, Williams sank into depression and drug use, which contributed to his own death in 1983.Today, the dreamy Villa Borghese gardens, with winding pathways, secretive corners and canopy of parasol pines, still feels just as Williams described it  like a soft abyss. And here, more than anywhere else in Rome, its not hard to imagine him as he once was, a man of youth and creative vigor, laughing into the void.Once an ambassadors residence, the neo-Renaissance Ambasciatori Palace (Via Vittorio Veneto 62; royalgroup.it/ambasciatoripalace) features marble columns, damask textiles and other grand flourishes. Classically renovated rooms start at 250 euros (about $290) in June.Rosati (Piazza del Popolo 5; barrosati.com) was one of Williamss favorite drinking spots and is still a great place to people-watch over Negronis, which cost 15 at the table, but just 5 at the bar.Today an espresso will set you back 5 at the now-corporatized inheritor of the storiedCaf Doney (Via Vittorio Veneto125; westinrome.com/en/cafe-doney, or restaurantdoney.com), which serves drinks, desserts and traditional lunch fare, including pizza and pasta (12 to 18).Williams was a regular at Alfredo, whose eponymous fettuccini attained global renown. Its two self-styled descendants are Alfredo alla Scrofa (Via della Scrofa 104; alfredoallascrofa.com) and Il Vero Alfredo (Piazza Augusto Imperatore 30; alfredo-roma.it). At both restaurants, dinner and drinks for two feel overpriced at around 100.Originally the 17th-century estate of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the bewitching 150-acre Villa Borghese gardens are open to the public from dawn till dusk. At the edge of the park stands the Galleria Borghese, once the cardinals party villa and now one of Romes most beloved art galleries, holding works by Caravaggio, Bernini and Titian, among others."}
{"text": "Richard Serra may have his ideological detractors, but he is certainly todays greatest living sculptor of Minimalist abstraction. Exhibitions of new works occupying Gagosian Gallerys two Chelsea display spaces find Mr. Serra at 76 still wrangling fundamentals of shape, space, gravity and time into objects and installations of thrilling severity.At West 21st Street is a single, grand example of his mazes made from immense ribbons of rolled steel; West 24th Street hosts three works made of solid steel slabs as well as a drawing installation. In certain respects these divergent strands in Mr. Serras oeuvre are opposites. While the maze subordinates material to gravity-defying form, the slab works favor weighty raw material. What the two have essentially in common is their consciousness-expanding effects.Standing in the middle of the huge West 21st Street space, NJ-1 resembles a big tent whose nearly 14-foot-high sides seem to be made of burnt-orange velvet. Up close you discover a beautiful, granular surface of rusted steel. Circling clockwise on the outside you find no entrance until youve gone three-quarters of the way, at which point the two-inch-thick wall swerves into a narrow corridor. Walking in, you approach a concave interior wall and openings to right and left. Either way, you proceed between walls tilting this way and that and admitting different amounts of light from above. (Claustrophobes beware.) A series of switchbacks eventually empties you into the first corridor and out.This is sculpture not just as an interesting object to look at but as an engulfing experience. Moving through the construction, you become acutely attuned to sight, touch and sound and to your own being in time and space. Consciousness itself becomes an object of consciousness. Perhaps theres a quasi-religious dimension, too, if you think of the maze as an ancient participatory ritual object in which the uncertain journey of life is ceremonially enacted and the possibility of spiritual progress is metaphorically expressed.The most arresting piece at West 24th Street is Silence (for John Cage), an 80-ton slab of forged steel lying flat on the floor. Knee-high and 29  feet by 9 feet 2 inches, it astounds by virtue of its sheer mass, its rugged physicality intensified by contrast with the pristine white walls of the gallery.Its worth noting Mr. Serras titular dedication to Cage, the avant-garde musician whose most famous composition, for piano, 433, consists of 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence. Mr. Cages piece is presumed to heighten audience attention to and appreciation of ambient sound and to invite meditation on just what exactly music is. Mr. Serras piece is similarly effective. You become enthralled by the brute presence of this enormous hunk of steel and your involvement with it. What did it take to transport such an unwieldy, dangerously heavy object to the gallery, to unload it and to place it so precisely in the gallery? What does such an operation cost?If you saw this piece in a steel foundry you might find it magnetic and even beautiful. But you wouldnt necessarily know it to be a work of art as it bears none of the conventional signs of aesthetic design, technique or symbolism. What does it add, then, to see it as an artwork? It shifts attention from the object itself to the sensory, intuitive and cognitive experience of it. Its a be-here-now situation. You might wonder what it means, for surely if it is art then it means something. But it answers only with a provocative silence, as per its title, as if to say that ultimate answers to questions of meaning and being are beyond human comprehension.Mr. Serras two other sculptures in this gallery have a similarly industrial and primordial feeling. Through consists of three slabs, each the same size as Silence, standing on their long sides in parallel. The whole is precisely oriented diagonally in the gallery so that peering through the narrow space between two slabs affords a view of one of the rooms distant corners. Metaphorically speaking, you see through the physically opaque to the metaphysically transcendent.Every Which Way has 16 slabs set up in a rectangular grid. Each slab is nearly a foot thick and they are in three heights  7, 9 and 11 feet. Walking among them is like strolling through a graveyard of massive tombstones. Rows alternating paired slabs and single ones create a stately, rhythmic impression, like a marching band playing funereal oompah music.A fourth, nonmetal piece,Above Below Betwixt Between, is an installation of flat, black rectangles made by applying paint to Belgian linen. In a white, cube-shaped room about 18 feet on a side, the black swatches fill the upper halves of two opposite walls and the lower halves of the others, creating an enveloping syncopation of impenetrable darkness and blinding light. Like the Rothko Chapel, this is a space for meditating on terrestrial perception and cosmic ineffabilities."}
{"text": "I Am Wrath is a revenge movie, and a buddy movie, and a spiritual-crisis movie, and a political corruption movie. Thats a lot of movies  too many, really, and it ends up not doing justice to any of those genres, despite star power at the top of the bill.John Travolta is Stanley, who, in the films opening moments, is in a parking garage with his wife (Rebecca De Mornay) when they fall victim to what seems like a random attack that leaves her dead and him badly beaten. Hes not happy about this, especially after he becomes suspicious that the police are not much interested in finding the perpetrators, and soon he goes after them himself.It turns out that he has some long-buried skills relevant to the task: He once did some sort of vaguely defined special-ops work. He seeks out his sidekick from the old days, a tough guy named Dennis, played by Christopher Meloni, and together they go in search of justice. The deeper they get, the more Stanley suspects that the attack on his wife, who was an aide to a high-powered politician, wasnt a random act at all.The script, besides being full of bad-guy clichs, doesnt give the actors enough opportunities to work up a buddy rapport, though the glimmers of it that they are permitted are promising. Stanley also has a few chats with a priest, but they dont probe deeply enough to make this film, directed by Chuck Russell, anything but an assemblage of predictable carnage.I Am Wrath is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language and lots of violence."}
{"text": "Q. Why is Dilma Rousseff facing impeachment proceedings?She is charged with violating budgetary laws in order to conceal a deficit before what she anticipated would be a tough 2014 re-election campaign, borrowing money from banks that the executive branch controls to fund domestic programs, and making changes to the federal budget without congressional approval.Q. What did the Senate vote on?The Senate voted on whether to start a trial of Ms. Rousseff. Last week, a Senate committee formally presented charges against her when it approved a document detailing the accusations.Q. What exactly are those charges?Ms. Rousseff is accused of violating Articles 85 and 167 of Brazils 1988 Constitution and the 1950 Law of Impeachment in making changes to the budget without congressional authorization. She is also accused of violating the Constitution and the same 1950 law in borrowing money from an institution that the state controls.Q. Why are these potentially impeachable offenses?The 1950 law defines crimes of responsibility, identifying more than 50 situations that call for impeachment. One is violating the annual budgetary law. The 1988 Constitution applies because it includes crimes of responsibility.The 2000 law of fiscal responsibility makes it illegal for the executive branch to borrow money from financial institutions it controls. The law also requires congressional approval of any changes in an annual budget after it has been approved.Q. Can Ms. Rousseff go to prison if the Senate convicts her?No, but she must step aside temporarily while the trial is underway and would have to resign if convicted.The nature of these crimes are administrative crimes, said Oscar Vilhena Vieira, a constitutional law professor at Fundao Getulio Vargas, a university in So Paulo. They are not penal crimes, so you cannot be put in prison because of them, but you can lose your mandate.Q. So is the Senate trial different from a criminal trial in a court?Yes. This is a political trial, and the standard of proof for conviction is less than it would be in a courtroom trial. If Ms. Rousseff were tried by the countrys Supreme Court over these same offenses, she would be likely to face better odds of obtaining a favorable result.That also means that congressional support is crucial. If she had a solid majority in Congress, these acts would be forgivable, said Braslio Sallum Jr., a professor of sociology at the University of So Paulo and an expert in Brazils political processes.Ms. Rousseffs problem, he said, is that, the majority support she had in Congress at the beginning of her presidency no longer exists."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is planning to issue a sweeping directive telling every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity.A letter to school districts will go out Friday, adding to a highly charged debate over transgender rights in the middle of the administrations legal fight with North Carolina over the issue. The declaration  signed by Justice and Education department officials  will describe what schools should do to ensure that none of their students are discriminated against.It does not have the force of law, but it contains an implicit threat: Schools that do not abide by the Obama administrations interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a loss of federal aid.The move is certain to draw fresh criticism, particularly from Republicans, that the federal government is wading into local matters and imposing its own values on communities across the country that may not agree. It represents the latest example of the Obama administration using a combination of policies, lawsuits and public statements to change the civil rights landscape for gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people.After supporting the rights of gay people to marry, allowing them to serve openly in the military and prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against them, the administration is wading into the battle over bathrooms and siding with transgender people.No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus, John B. King Jr., the secretary of the Department of Education, said in a statement. We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from, they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.Courts have not settled the question of whether the nations sex discrimination laws apply in matters of gender identity. But administration officials, emboldened by a federal appeals court ruling in Virginia last month, think they have the upper hand. This week, the Justice Department and North Carolina sued each other over a state law that restricts access to bathrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms. The letter to school districts had been in the works for months, Justice Department officials said.A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so, according to the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times.A schools obligation under federal law to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex requires schools to provide transgender students equal access to educational programs and activities even in circumstances in which other students, parents, or community members raise objections or concerns, the letter states. As is consistently recognized in civil rights cases, the desire to accommodate others discomfort cannot justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages a particular class of students.As soon as a childs parent or legal guardian asserts a gender identity for the student that differs from previous representations or records, the letter says, the child is to be treated accordingly  without any requirement for a medical diagnosis or birth certificate to be produced. It says that schools may  but are not required to  provide other restroom and locker room options to students who seek additional privacy for whatever reason.Attached to the letter, the Obama administration will include a 25-page document describing emerging practices that are in place in many schools around the country. Those included installing privacy curtains or allowing students to change in bathroom stalls.In a blog post accompanying the letter, senior officials at the Justice and Education Departments said they issued it in response to a growing chorus of inquiries from educators, parents and students across the country, including from the National Association of Secondary School Principals, to clarify their obligations and best practices for the treatment of transgender students.Schools want to do right by all of their students and have looked to us to provide clarity on steps they can take to ensure that every student is comfortable at their school, is in an environment free of discrimination, and has an opportunity to thrive, wrote Catherine E. Lhamon, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights, and Vanita Gupta, the head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.Thomas Aberli, a high school principal in Louisville, Ky., said the new guidance would help administrators across the country who are trying to determine the best way to establish safe and inclusive schools. He said his school had little to work with when it drafted a policy that was put in place last year.What you dont do is go and tell a kid, You know, there is something so freakishly different about you that you make other people uncomfortable, so were going to make you do something different, said Mr. Aberli, who estimated that his school of 1,350 students had about six transgender children. Theres been no incident since its implementation. Its really just a nonissue in our school.The White House has called North Carolinas law meanspirited and said this week that federal agencies were continuing a review of their policies on the treatment of transgender people while the administration waged its legal battle with the state.President Obama condemned the law last month, saying it was partly the result of politics and emotions that people had on the issue.When it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, whether theyre transgender or gay or lesbian, although I respect their different viewpoints, I think its very important for us not to send signals that anybody is treated differently, Mr. Obama said at a news conference in London.The struggle over the rights of transgender people has reverberated on the presidential campaign trail and become a defining issue in the final year of Mr. Obamas tenure, prompting boycotts of North Carolina by some celebrities and businesses that had planned to create jobs there. The fresh guidance to be issued Friday seemed certain to intensify that debate, and showed that Mr. Obama and his administration intend to press the issue of transgender rights aggressively as the legal challenge unfolds.The Justice Department has for years made gay and transgender issues centerpieces of its civil rights agenda. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. described that campaign as a continuation of the civil rights era that brought equal rights to African-Americans. And this week, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch spoke passionately to transgender people as she cast the lawsuit against North Carolina in historic terms.We stand with you, she said. And we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. Please know that history is on your side.Some Republicans have defended North Carolinas law by arguing that it would be inappropriate to allow transgender women to use the same bathroom as young girls. Before ending his presidential bid last week, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas charged that Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, both agree that grown men should be allowed to use the little girls restroom."}

Trump came to Washington on Thursday to unify the Republican Party behind him.That did not quite happen.But here is what did: The political denizens showed once again that Mr. Trump, the reality TV star turned presumptive Republican presidential nominee, can animate the staid capital as much as any other city in America.It helped that Mr. Trumps visit happened to coincide with the National Cannabis Industry Associations annual lobbying trip to the Capitol, and onlookers would have been forgiven for thinking that Washington had accidentally eaten the entire pan of brownies.The least exciting part of the whole Trumpapalooza was the meetings themselves  those closed-door huddles between Mr. Trump and Republican leaders, which produced bland statements of party unity on both sides but little actual news.Yet the politely subdued signals from both factions belied the frenzy just outside the Republican National Committees cream-colored building, where the first two of Mr. Trumps meetings occurred. There, more than three dozen protesters and more than five dozen members of the news media arrived early as a morning rush-hour crowd looked on quizzically.Its like our Super Bowl, one reporter said to a group of tourists who had stopped to gawk.This is what we train for, people! a cameraman said to no one in particular.As the crowd waited for Mr. Trump, the diverse group of demonstrators  a gaggle of undocumented immigrants, a small cabal of women from the protest group Codepink, and a lone man holding a Rabbis Against Trump sign  all vied for attention.At one point, a man wearing a giant papier-mch Trump head and clutching oversize Scrooge McDuck bags of money bobbled about behind a Trump supporter, who alternated between blasting Christian music from a megaphone and puffing into a large shofar.When Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, showed up  having skirted a kilted man wailing on his bagpipes and having jumped over a gate to avoid the crowded sidewalk  a guard greeted him, asking how he was.Well, Id be better if you had a back door, Mr. Issa said.Yet there were at least small signs that Mr. Trumps visit was different from the standard-model Trump on display all through the primary season: The man himself was nowhere to be seen, at least to the public.With the exception of a small wave he offered from the back of his dark sport utility vehicle between stops, hardly anyone not invited to the meetings glimpsed him anywhere  at least no one among the masses of journalists, protesters and onlookers who descended Thursday morning on the various venues, entrances, exits and back doors of Capitol Hill.Instead, Mr. Trump inadvertently ceded his image to his oversize papier-mch doppelgnger, who delivered assorted Trumpisms with varying degrees of accuracy. You know what torture is? the fake Trump crowed. Torture is getting a really bad chili dog down at Coney Island.The P. T. Barnum scene seemed oddly fitting for a campaign that, at times, has felt like a passing parade, the surreal blending viscerally with the passions Mr. Trump elicits. And even while unseen, Mr. Trump demonstrated that he is still fully capable of setting off a Category 5 fuss just by being in the vicinity.At one point, in what passed for excitement Thursday morning, a gray Ford Fusion rear-ended a blue Chevrolet Cobalt on the narrow slice of street where members of the news media and of the Secret Service had lined up on opposite sides.Though the cars were quickly moved around the corner to clear a path for Mr. Trumps arrival, a Capitol Police officer saw an opportunity and approached the tightly packed news media to ask for footage of the fender-bender.Who wants to send me a video? he asked. No one saw it? No cameras or nothing?In one of the odder moments, and in the absence of actual politicians, the demonstrators began protesting the papier-mch Trump  who was, in fact, protesting the real Trump.We are the 99 percent! they shouted.I own the 99 percent, the fake Trump countered.Meanwhile, young Republican National Committee staff members pressed themselves against the windows, peering out and taking photographs of the scene.And on the top floor of the building, one employee shoved open his window and leaned out, white shirt sleeves rolled up, craning to see the spectacle.We are all that man, one Trump reporter said, with a resigned sigh."}
{"text": "Washington  ON Monday, the Iranian militarys deputy chief of staff announced that the Islamic Republic had successfully tested yet another ballistic missile  this time, a high-precision midrange weapon with a reported reach of 2,000 kilometers, or 1,250 miles, and with a degree of accuracy that he claimed to be without any error. If these statements are true, the entire Middle East, including Israel, is within the reach of the mullahs missiles.It was not revealed if this missile had its genocidal intent actually inscribed on it, as other missiles recently tested by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have  with the inscription in Hebrew Israel should be erased from the map. But it hardly matters. The mullahs objectives are plain enough for anyone with eyes to see: The Iranian regime is continuing its determined march toward not only a nuclear weapon, but also the means to launch it, first against Israel and then against the United States.This reality makes all the more inexplicable President Obamas steadfast faith that, since the election of President Hassan Rouhani in 2013, Iran has been charting a more moderate course to the detriment of the old-time hard-liners, and that Mr. Rouhani and his administration would be reliable partners in negotiations over Irans nuclear program.To give credit where credit is due, the regime in Tehran has been frank and open about its continued hostility toward America and Israel. In the months since the Obama administration and the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany (the group commonly referred to as the P5 + 1) concluded the deal with Iran called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Revolutionary Guards have tested at least four ballistic missiles. Flush with the $100 billion they claim to be getting in assets unfrozen under the deal, the mullahs have gone on a spending spree, finally purchasing, among other things, the Russian S-300 missile system, which is now being delivered to them.Who can forget the searing images of American sailors on their knees with guns pointed at their heads by our moderate partners this past January? Just last week, in the course of receiving an official delegation from the Gaza-based militant movement Palestinian Islamic Jihad  which the State Department designated a terrorist group in 1997, for its efforts to destroy Israel  the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reiterated that the prime directive of the Islamic Republic remains, as it has been since 1979, to wage war against the United States and Israel.On Saturday, Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, that trusted counterpart to Secretary of State John Kerry, publicly affirmed to the Iranian Parliament that the same supreme leader who had just said doing harm to America and Israel was his key objective remains the ultimate arbiter of Iranian foreign policy. And as a final reminder of how the Islamic Republic conducts itself toward America, on Monday Amir Hekmati, a former United States Marine, sued the government of Iran for the brutal torture inflicted on him over the course of more than four years of arbitrary detention by Tehran.Enough. The mullahs policy is, by their own admission, unchanged. It is the same one that inspired the so-called revolutionaries of 1979 to take 52 Americans as hostages for 444 days, and motivated murderous attacks on Israelis and Americans from Buenos Aires to Beirut to Baghdad over the subsequent decades. The only thing that is changing now is the potential scale of this violence, as they seek to replace truck bombs and roadside explosive devices with the most destructive weapons on the planet and the means to deliver them.The sensible thing to do now is to face this reality, however unpleasant it may be, and do what we can to bolster our defenses and those of our allies.As a first step, I look forward to working with my congressional colleagues this week and in coming months to make sure that President Obamas failure to sufficiently fund Israels missile defense programs in his latest budget request is reversed. Shockingly, even after admitting that the nuclear deal with Iran places Israel in greater danger and making assurances that support for the Jewish state would be increased, the president could not find a single dollar to put toward procurement for the Davids Sling or Arrow-3 missile defense systems, which are being jointly developed by the United States and Israel.We have all been impressed by the success of Israels Iron Dome air defense system, which targets short-range rockets and was implemented with the generous assistance of American taxpayers. But as the recent Iranian medium-range missile test proves, rockets fired from Gaza are not the only threat Israel faces.Providentially, Davids Sling, which guards against such ballistic missiles, is ready to go online this year; it will be followed by the Arrow-3 system to protect the Jewish state from longer-range weapons. Rather than starving these programs, Congress should seize this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to Israels security and so to our own. That would send the leaders of the Islamic Republic an unmistakable signal that there are at least some in Washington who still take them at their word, and will act accordingly."}
{"text": "ROME  The strange became normal at the third round of the Italian Open on Thursday, beginning with Novak Djokovic being blanked in his opening set against 37th-ranked Thomaz Bellucci before recovering for a 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory.Djokovic called the opening set a complete Bellucci storm. When he finally got on the board by holding his serve in the opening game of the second set, he celebrated by raising his arms high into the air.Sometimes if you dont start well and your opponent is seeing the ball like a watermelon, thats what happens, Djokovic said. Youve got to give him credit, thats all I can say. But it was one set, fortunately for me, not two.Roger Federer played two sets on Thursday and lost them both, falling by 7-6 (2), 6-4 to 13th-seeded Dominic Thiem. Still nursing a back injury he sustained in Madrid, Federer had declared that winning his first title in Rome was out of the question after he eked out a victory in his first match on Wednesday.Im too far off, Federer said. Im so far off that it wont happen.Despite his loss on Thursday, Federer said he was encouraged by playing in Rome. This was an information tournament for me, never a result tournament, he said. I knew I wasnt good enough for any result here, so thats why I hope you dont read into it so much  and I dont.The information that Federer gathered, however, was insufficient to let him wholeheartedly commit to playing in the French Open, despite his obvious desire to do so. The tournament begins on May 22, and Federer has played in the main draw of a record 65 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments.After missing much of the spring hardcourt season with injury and illness, Federer had hoped for success on clay this year by gaining more rest and having more time to focus on clay court preparations. I actually thought I could really do a good result in Paris, he said. Now the last couple of weeks its been more difficult. I see my chances as not great to have the most unbelievable run. But if maybe in three, four days I can practice 100 percent for the next week, then I believe that something is possible again.But as of now, clearly the way Im playing right now is never going to be enough for any good run in Paris, and then I also wouldnt play this way. But Im still confident I will be fine, somehow.Djokovic is continuing his preparations for his pursuit of the only Grand Slam tournament title he has never won. His efforts seemed to take a hit in the first set on Thursday, the first time he has lost a set without winning a game since Federer blanked him in the opening set of the Cincinnati final in 2012. In the next round, Djokovic will almost certainly need a better start against fifth-ranked Rafael Nadal, who survived the flashy Nick Kyrgios, 6-7 (3), 6-2, 6-4.At this level, logically you should not expect to have too many bagels, especially if you play as a top player playing against somebody who is top 20, top 15, Djokovic said. Usually these matches are decided in few instances, few points. So it is weird to see bagels. And, yeah, fortunately for me I didnt end up as Tomas.Djokovic was referring to eighth-ranked Tomas Berdych, who lost, 6-0, 6-0, to 12th-ranked David Goffin. It was only the second shutout on the ATP Tour this year, the first at a Masters event since 2007, and the first with a top-10 player on the receiving end since 2005.Goffin had not won so much as a set in his two previous matches against Berdych, and he entered the contest with a 2-26 record against top-10 opponents. Its just an amazing feeling, Goffin said. Its the perfect day, the perfect match for me. Ive never played like this. The ball was like a soccer ball. Everything was going my way.The quirkiest moment in the womens draw concerned the lingering effects of Serena Williamss dietary choices on Wednesday, when she sampled cuisine designed for canines. After shaking off the ensuing ill effects on Thursday, Williams fended off a set point in a 7-6 (7), 6-1 win over Christina McHale.Williams said she ordered room service from her hotels Doggy Menu for her Yorkshire terrier, Chip. She thought the salmon-and-rice dish looked so appetizing that she tried a spoonful herself  a decision she quickly regretted.I dont know how my dog eats that, Williams said. I guess hes O.K. with it."}
{"text": "Dont close your eyes, says Claressa Shields, who at 17 became the first American woman to win an Olympic gold medal in boxing, in 2012. Squeezing your eyes shut wont lessen the pain. Try to avoid even blinking. Watch the fist come in and learn from it.Deflect the impact by keeping your elbows in close to your sides and shifting your body so the advancing fist grazes your elbow or bicep rather than slamming into your ribs or belly. Keep in constant motion but maintain a centered stance. Dont do a big move to get out of the way, Shields says. To counter a swing to the face, duck your head to the side, a tactic boxers call slipping. A blow to the face looks bad. Even if it doesnt hurt, such a punch creates the perception that youre losing, particularly if you bleed or your head flies backward. Avoid that whiplash action by strengthening your neck muscles.Whatever you do, dont get angry. Dont let yourself be overtaken by fear, spite or rage. Never fight from emotion, says Shields, who wasnt much of a talker as a child; as early as second grade, she was fighting her classmates. I used my fists to explain myself, she says. She started boxing at 11 in Flint, Mich., and in the gym she learned to control her temper, to stay in the present moment, to endure. If you get hit, tell yourself: Its just one punch, she says.Also, dont get distracted. Shields keeps her focus on her opponents chest so she can see the precursory muscle movements that indicate a nascent jab or hook. She avoids eye contact. Sometimes in the ring an adversary will wink at Shields, blow a kiss, grin wildly or stick out her tongue. (She likes to say that 80 percent of boxing is mental.) If youre hitting or being hit in a psychologically messy, fervid state, stop. You may hit me with one good shot, says Shields, who will compete in the Olympics again this summer in Rio de Janeiro, but Im patient. Ill wait, and then Ill land three or four."}

{"text": "I must have breathed while watching Cash Only. But it sure felt as if I didnt. This brutal and severe film has that effect.The intensity starts in its first seconds, when Elvis Martini (Nickola Shreli, flinty and convincing) bolts down the street after setting fire to his Detroit home. We then flash forward two years. His arson, an insurance scam, had unintended consequences, and Elvis is now in debt to a local thug. Adding to his problems, most of the tenants in another building he has mortgaged are short on rent and long on excuses.After evicting one of them, Elvis finds a stash of money in her apartment that he uses to stave off insolvency. That cash, however, belonged to a sadistic criminal who demands that it be paid back within hours. Or else.The script, by Mr. Shreli, finds every action triggering an unexpected reaction, usually a hostile one. Elvis is no saint, but hes upright enough to be sympathetic, and that makes the plot all the more anxious as he hurries to raise money.The movie, directed by Malik Bader, was filmed in just a few weeks, and the sense of speed carries over into the finished product. The jumpy camera work (Christos Moisides is the cinematographer) is nerve-racking; there are no stylishly posed shots, no falsely clever dialogue. Everything here drives the story on, and except for the excessive ending, it feels authentic, from the unsentimental Albanian immigrant neighborhood to the no-nonsense supporting performances.The grittiness of Cash Only feels as if it could scrape the enamel off your teeth. Even when a scene is less than vicious, a harsh aftertaste lingers. That can be an unpleasant feeling. But sometimes life is unpleasant. And this film is alive."}
{"text": "In Neighbors (2014), Seth Rogen plays Mac, a befuddled new dad locked in a battle of wills against a rowdy, dope-smoking fraternity that moves in next door. In Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, opening Friday, May 20, his foe is a sorority fighting for the right to drink booze in their own houses, just like frats do. The movies are funny in part because Mr. Rogen  marijuana advocate and star of stoner comedies like Pineapple Express  is so intently playing against type. He should be the one people are calling the cops on, not the other way around.The truth is, while his real high school buddies were in college, Mr. Rogen was already gainfully employed. At 18, this Canadian-born actor was writing for Undeclared, the Judd Apatow TV series about, yes, college. I remember being like, yeah, [expletive] them, theyre still in school  Ive got a job, I live in L.A., he said. And then I visited them and stayed in the dorms, and it blew my mind. It was so much fun. I was like, they live in these little rooms. They dont have to do anything.In an interview in Universal City, Calif., Mr. Rogen, 34, talked about Neighbors 2; his coming animated feature, Sausage Party (he plays a lovesick wiener); and The Interview, a 2014 comedy about Kim Jong-un that led North Korea to threaten retaliation against the United States. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Frat boys are easy to hate. Did you have concerns about vilifying sorority members?Whats different about this movie is that the sorority members are doing something that is just and correct in a lot of ways. That being said, I think young people are just scary to old people, and that actually made it easy to villainize them. As an older person, youre just horrified of an 18-year-old. The moral part of their brain isnt fully developed. When I was 18, I was psychotic.Does it relate to Mac having a daughter?We realized the film would be about the fear of our daughter not liking us, that we wouldnt be able to relate to her when she became a teenager. So a group of teenage girls suddenly living next to us was a good way to reflect that story.Both films had revenge as a central theme. Are you a vengeful person?No, Im really not. Im not a competitive or a vengeful person, at all. Im too lazy.When The Interview controversy unfolded, what was it like for you and your co-star James Franco?There were moments where we were watching the president talk about us, and we were in our offices laughing our [expletive] off. But then there were moments where it was like, no theater is going to show our movie now because there have been terrorist threats made against it. It bounced back and forth between being kind of amazing and being really horrible.Whats up with the title Sausage Party? In America, we call those things hot dogs.We do! And I really am playing a hot dog. It should be called Hot Dog Party, but it just doesnt sound as good. Youre the first person of many who will point that out.How did you come up with the voice?My hot dog sounds exactly like me. People in the movie like Bill [Hader], Nick Kroll, theyre amazing at doing so many different voices. Ive just got the one voice. My voice has locked me into a box.If you could smoke weed with three people, living or dead, who would they be?Oh, thats a good question. Barbra Streisand once told me a story where she smoked weed with Peter Sellers, which is one of the few stories that Ive been outrageously jealous of. Peter Sellers would be a wonderful person to smoke weed with. Who else? Gandhi! Why not? (laughs) And Bob Marley, because, of course."}
{"text": "CANNES, France  Woody, Woody, Woody! Please, please, please!One of the familiar sounds of the annual Cannes Film Festival, blended with the roar of the crowd, is that of the pleading paparazzi. Each year, several hundred photographers and many more television teams descend on this festival to immortalize the newest red-carpet immortals, who are sometimes, in this auteur-driven event, the old immortals. Such is the case with Woody Allen, a festival veteran who was back on Wednesday night, this time with Caf Society, a middling entertainment that features enough famous names to make it a perfect opening-night diversion.Mr. Allen traded in his customary sneakers for dress shoes and a tuxedo for his latest tour on the carpet, where he was joined by his wife, Soon-Yi, and his stars, Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg. After putting in the requisite smiles (wave, turn, repeat), the team joined the black-tie throng for the premiere, followed by the official dinner and more photo ops, even among rising chatter about a critical article written by Mr. Allens son, Ronan Farrow. This years dinner was more subdued than those in the past and took place inside the Palais des Festivals et des Congrs, the official headquarters, where a fleet of police and guards mingled with politicians, stars like Catherine Deneuve, the writer Jean-Claude Carrire (Belle de Jour) and waiters rushing plates of veal to tables.Cinema gives Cannes its reason for being, but it is celebrity that keeps it going. Now in its 69th year, the festival has survived assorted jolts, including television, the transition to digital and World War II, which led to the cancellation of the inaugural edition, in 1939. When it got underway in 1946, its slate included Jean Cocteaus Beauty and the Beast. A quotation from Cocteau on the festival website asserts that Cannes is an apolitical no mans land, a microcosm of what the world would be like if people could make direct contact with one another and speak the same language. The apolitical part has always been nonsense, as the events history of protests and policing show.Certainly, it is still nonsense, given that France remains under a state of emergency, following the deadly November attacks in and around Paris. Festivalgoers arrived amid competing dramatic headlines  Bomb sweeps and bag checks as terror threat looms over Cannes, The Guardian announced on Tuesday  that suggested that attendees could expect to endure the paramilitary-like rigors of an Academy Awards ceremony or even a big Hollywood premiere. (I passed through several metal detectors for the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.) Yet entrance to the Palais remains much the same as before and largely involves personnel peering in bags, confiscating water bottles (and apples and sandwiches) and scanning attendees with electronic security wands.And, so, its on with the show, with all its glamour, gowns, parties, high-ticket hookers, trolling Lamborghinis, incessant Euro disco and the push and pull between the dream world onscreen and the one outside the Palais. Cannes is nothing if not in touch with its history, including its commitment to protocol, and it is apparently not going to let the threat of terror get in the way of some 30,000 souls who are here to screen, to see and be seen. The players, including the juries, have convened (the head of the competition jury is George Miller, here last year with Mad Max: Fury Road); the first reviews have already been written, read and forgotten.The selections run the usual gamut, from noncompetition titles, like Money Monster, which are clearly here to help fill out the red carpet, in this case with its director (Jodie Foster) and star (George Clooney). These boldfaced names are especially important, given that the first few competition movies to play are star-free zones. Later in the festival, the paparazzi will be crying out, Steven, Steven, Steven! when Steven Spielberg appears with his latest movie, The BFG (set to open in the United States in July), followed a few days later by shouts of Ryan! and Russell! (for Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe), the stars of The Nice Guys (opening next Friday in the States).It will probably take longer for Sieranevada, from the Romanian director Cristi Puiu, to make its way to American screens. A movie about cinematic time, historical memory and camera movement (among other things), Sieranevada takes place largely in a cramped apartment, where an extended family has gathered to commemorate a dead relative. There, as doors open and close, and the camera pans right and left, Mr. Puiu creates a complex multigenerational portrait of a post-Ceausescu Romania in which discussions about the attacks on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo take place in one room, while in another, the talk turns to Romanian Communism, God and belief.Mr. Puiu likes to take his time, and, at three hours, the movie feels about 30 minutes too long. Still, even when he dawdles, he keeps you hooked with his filmmaking and his characters. Their engagement in the world offers a vivid contrast with both the Jewish caricatures in Caf Society and the tedious eccentrics populating Alain Guiraudies Staying Vertical, about a filmmaker who raises his baby alone after the childs mother understandably splits. Mr. Guiraudies characters are art film creatures and as artificial as the wisecracking stereotypes in Caf Society, where none of the men and women appear remotely aware of the world, much less post-1933 Germany.Mr. Allens sense of the past is certainly selective. Once again, he has returned to the Good Old Days, including a 1930s Hollywood that looks like the movies, or at least wants to. Mr. Eisenberg plays Bobby Dorfman, a New Yorker who moves to La-La Land to find himself, or some such. There, he instead finds work with his Uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a big-time Hollywood agent, and love with Vonnie (Ms. Stewart), one of Phils employees. Complications ensue, along with jokes, uneven performances, some unfunny business with a prostitute and lots of name-dropping. References to stars like Greta Garbo are tossed around, while Barbara Stanwyck pops up in a clip from The Woman in Red, and Jean Harlow briefly swings by in Libeled Lady, another 1930s release.These old-studio flicks give Caf Society a bit of oomph, even as its story also brings to mind Frank Capras pre-Code title Forbidden (a plush Stanwyck vehicle). The earlier films also underscore the thin, sharp-edged digital look of Caf Society, which is neither period-appropriate nor realistic, especially in the honeyed Los Angeles scenes. The cinematographer is the legendary Vittorio Storaro, but this is far from his finest work. (Much, if not all, of the color work was probably done in postproduction.) When Mr. Allen, who provides the on-and-off voice-over, refers to a beautiful sky, what you see onscreen are colors that are more urine-hued than sun-kissed.Caf Society got a polite reception at its first press screening on Wednesday morning; its scheduled to open in the United States in July. By Thursday, talk about the movie and its merits had given way to an increasingly loud hum about Mr. Farrows guest column in The Hollywood Reporter, which tackled the media response to accusations from his sister, Dylan Farrow, that her father had sexually abused her. Its a strong, tough article and should be read. It raises vital questions about how the media treats allegations of sexual assault, about the reluctance to risk access to celebrities, how we view artists who are accused of heinous abuse and whether its ever possible  or right  to separate artists from their work and the worlds that they help create."}

{"text": "Animal migrations combine staggering endurance and exquisite timing.Consider the odyssey of a bird known as the red knot. Each spring, flocks of the intrepid shorebirds fly up to 9,300 miles from the tropics to the Arctic. As the snow melts, they mate and produce a new generation of chicks. The chicks gorge themselves on insects, and then all the red knots head back south.They are there less than two months, said Jan A. van Gils, an ecologist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research. Its a very tight schedule.It is also a vulnerable one. The precipitous decline of the red knots that winter in West Africa may provide a small but telling parable of the perils of climate change.In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. van Gils and his colleagues present evidence that indicates climate change is putting pressure on the birds along their entire journey, possibly helping to drive down the birds population and making them yet another of many species around the world being affected by climate change.The new study shows how climate change can create ecological ripples that can threaten a species in unexpected ways.I think its a fascinating study, said David S. Wilcove, an expert on animal migrations at Princeton University. It illustrates the odd and almost unpredictable ways in which climate change is affecting biodiversity.And if Dr. van Gils and his colleagues are right, further warming will make the plight of the red knot even more dire.I foresee some sort of crash, Dr. van Gils said.The researchers got their first clue that something was amiss when they studied a subspecies of red knots that winters on the coast of Mauritania in West Africa. Typically, red knots dig into the sand to harvest clams with their long bills. The scientists were intrigued to discover that some of the birds were digging up sea grass roots and eating them instead.That puzzled me, Dr. van Gils said. So I wondered, Why is this?It turns out that the clams are buried deeper in the sand than the sea grass roots are. Small red knots with short bills could not reach the clams, so they had to make do with the less nutritious sea grass roots. These smaller birds go for something they dont like so much, Dr. van Gils said.To understand why the birds grew to different sizes, the team began a study of the red knots full migratory path. In June, the birds leave Mauritania and fly to the Arctic coast of Russia. At the end of July, they make a return trip. The adults stop off to refuel in the Netherlands, while the juvenile red knots travel through Poland.The scientists found a disturbing trend: Over the past 30 years, the juveniles arriving in Poland have been shrinking in size. On average, they are about 15 percent smaller today than in 1985.Looking at satellite images of their Arctic summer habitat, the scientists found a clue to this trend. The Arctic has been warming up earlier because of climate change. Today, the snow is melting two weeks earlier than in 1985.The insects in the Arctic are responding to the shift by hatching earlier. But the red knots are not adjusting their schedule. By the time their chicks hatch, the insects are far past their peak, and the birds cant find as much food as they could 30 years ago.When the birds arrive in Mauritania in July, the smaller juveniles with shorter beaks cannot dig deep enough to eat their regular diet of clams. Instead, they are eating more sea grass. This new diet appears to be taking a toll: Dr. van Gils and his colleagues have found that juvenile red knots with short bills are more likely to die than birds with long bills.(How the shorebirds, which turn a rusty color in spring, got their name is a bit of a mystery. One theory suggests that the pattern of the birds feeding along the tide line evoked the image of Canute, a Norse king whose failed efforts to hold back the tide became legend. Another possible notion could be that the birds grunting call sounds like the word knot.)Martin Wikelski, a zoologist at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology who was not involved in the research, cautioned that some questions about the birds were still unanswered. For example, the team kept track of the birds in Mauritania by banding them with colored rings. When the birds disappeared, the scientists couldnt know for sure if they were dead or had just gone elsewhere.Its the first of its kind, Dr. Wikelski said of the new study, but it might not be true.Scientists will be able to get better data about migratory birds, Dr. Wikelski said, as miniature tracking devices become more powerful and affordable. Experiments will also allow scientists to test hypotheses about the animals. This summer, for example, Dr. van Gils is going to study a population of red knots that summer in Alaska. He will move eggs to places where insects emerge at different times in the summer. He predicts the timing will affect the chicks growth.Dr. van Gils said that climate change might be a factor behind the decline of the red knots that winter in Mauritania. They have decreased from about half a million birds to a quarter of a million.If that continues, theyre going to go extinct, he said.Dr. Wikelski still wants to see more evidence to judge the future of migratory birds in a warmer world. But he has seen enough to be worried.Maybe theyre sentinels, he said about the red knots. We should take these early warning signs seriously."}
{"text": "DENVER  The Obama administrations directive Friday on the use of school bathrooms and locker rooms by transgender students intensified the latest fierce battle in the nations culture wars, with conservatives calling it an illegal overreach that will put children in danger and advocates for transgender rights hailing it as a breakthrough for civil rights.The policy drew a swift backlash from conservative politicians, groups and parents.In Texas, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick appealed to local school boards and superintendents not to abide by the directive, noting that there were just a few weeks left in the school year and time over the summer to fight the policy with legislation or legal action. We will not be blackmailed, he said.I believe it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public schools, Mr. Patrick, a Republican, said at a news conference. Parents are not going to send their 14-year-old daughters into the shower or bathroom with 14-year-old boys. Its not going to happen.With a jab at another job Mr. Patrick has held, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said, I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to a statewide office.Earlier in the day, the Justice and Education Departments sent a letter to school districts saying that students must be allowed to use the facilities that match the sex they identify as, even if that conflicts with their anatomical sex. For districts that refuse to comply, the directive carries the potential threat of legal action or the withholding of federal funds.The administration had already taken that position in scattered cases around the country  from a school district in the Chicago suburb, to a district in rural Virginia to, most prominently, this weeks lawsuit challenging a North Carolina state law  but Fridays directive was the most sweeping attempt yet to impose that view, turning it into a national issue.A recent poll found that a majority of Americans opposed laws like North Carolinas that require transgender people to use facilities that match the sex listed on their birth certificates, though the survey did not specifically ask about schools and children. Republicans were evenly split, while Democrats and independents were strongly opposed to such requirements.The events this week demonstrate how starkly views vary by region. The Massachusetts State Senate passed a bill that would allow transgender people to use the bathrooms conforming to their gender identities.The new guidance from the Obama administration on transgender youth in schools reaffirms a basic human right, said Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill DeBlasio of New York City, which already has such a policy. No child should face humiliation and embarrassment because of their gender identity, especially during such a private moment.In Fort Worth, a deep divide became evident after the school district adopted a similar policy, prompting impassioned speeches and demonstrations from both sides at a school board meeting.At the same time, eight states filed a brief siding with North Carolina in its legal fight with the administration. And in Fannin County, Ga., a sparsely populated area bordering North Carolina and Tennessee, hundreds of people marched to a school board meeting to insist that the district stick to traditional, anatomical standards in defining sex.Steve Fallin, a pastor who participated in the march, spoke of a rising anger among many Christians who feel they are not being treated with respect, a fury that intensified Friday with news of the presidents directive.What President Obama did with this letter, he just cranked up the heat on the pot just a few degrees too high, Mr. Fallin said. I can tell you from what I saw last night, most of rural America, particularly the South, is right ready to just boil over.Advocates on both sides said they suspect that most school districts did not have explicit policies defining gender. There are districts that allow transgender students to use the facilities that match their identities, and districts that prohibit it, but no definitive count of either group.Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, argued that the administration was distorting a 1972 law requiring equal rights for women and girls in education, known as Title IX.The Obama administration has absolutely no legal authority to change what a statute means, and thats what theyre doing, he said. And they have complete and utter disregard for students privacy and safety in these intimate settings.Tim Moore, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House, said, We all have to wonder what other threats to common sense norms may come before the sun sets on the Obama administration.Despite the federal directive and a civil rights complaint by the American Civil Liberties Union, the school district in Marion County, Fla., said it would not change its bathroom policy. Its just an overreaching federal government that didnt follow the rules, said Nancy Stacy, a board member. Theyre just bullying everybody.But transgender people and groups that advocate for them praised the administrations action on Friday as a civil rights milestone.Capri Culpepper, a transgender high school senior in Anderson, S.C., said the guidelines offered support to students like her, who can feel isolated and ostracized. She said school officials told her last year that she had to stop using the girls restroom because it was making people uncomfortable, and allowed her to use a staff bathroom or one in the nurses office.They were segregating me into this restroom that I didnt feel like I belonged in, she said.Defenders of traditional gender norms say that changing them threatens the safety of women, allowing men claiming to be transgender women into womens bathrooms. Transgender advocates say that fear is misplaced, and the far greater danger is to transgender people.When you make a transgender student use a bathroom that is separate from all the other boys and girls you send a clear signal to the student body and to teachers that that student is so different that they can be treated worse, said Michael Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund.Jabari Lyles, president of a gay community center in Baltimore and the education manager for Baltimores chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, applauded the directive, but said it would be an uphill battle to put in place.Hopefully, what this doesnt do is put transgender students more in danger because the law has taken a bold step on their side, he said.Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said, This is a truly significant moment not only for transgender young people but for all young people, sending a message that every student deserves to be treated fairly and supported by their teachers and schools."}
{"text": "IN 1979, in a short book called The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class, the sociologist Alvin Gouldner took up a question then being vigorously debated by social analysts: Did the student movements of the 1960s signal that the highly educated were on their way to becoming a major political force in American society?Dr. Gouldners answer was yes. As a man of the left, he had mixed feelings about this development, since he thought the intelligentsia might be tempted to put its own interests ahead of the marginalized groups for whom it often claimed to speak.Today, with an ideological gap widening along educational lines in the United States, Dr. Gouldners arguments are worth revisiting. Now that so many people go to college, Americans with bachelors degrees no longer constitute an educational elite. But the most highly educated Americans  those who have attended graduate or professional school  are starting to come together as a political bloc.Last month, the Pew Research Center released a study showing that nearly a third of those who went to graduate or professional school have down the line liberal views on social, economic and environmental matters, whereas this is true for just one in 10 Americans generally. An additional quarter of postgrads have mostly liberal views. These numbers reflect drastic change: While professionals have been in the Democratic column for a while, in 1994 only 7 percent of postgrads held consistently liberal political opinions.Dr. Gouldners new class wasnt exactly the contemporary intelligentsia, with its Washington policy analysts, New York editors and Bay Area biotech researchers. But it was close. Dr. Gouldner observed changes in the American occupational structure that he thought were altering the balance of power among social classes. As he saw it, beginning in the early 20th century, increasing complexity in science, technology, economic affairs and government meant that the old moneyed class no longer had the expertise to directly manage the work process or steer the ship of state.Members of the old class turned to scientists, engineers, managers, human relations specialists, economists and other professionals for help. As these experts multiplied, they realized the extent of their collective power. They demanded fitting levels of pay and status and insisted on professional autonomy. A new class was born, neither owner nor worker.A distinguishing feature of this new class, according to Dr. Gouldner, was the way it spoke and argued. Steeped in science and expert knowledge, it embraced a culture of critical discourse. Evidence and logic were valued; appeals to traditional sources of authority were not. Members of the new class raised their children in such a culture. And it was these children, allergic to authoritarian values, who as young adults were at the center of the student revolts, finding common ground with disaffected humanistic intellectuals bent on changing the world.Dr. Gouldner assumed that as the student radicals aged and entered the work force, they would retain their leftist sympathies. But he conceded that they might also work to shore up their privileges. He characterized the new class as the great hope of the left in a period when the American labor movement was in decline, yet also as flawed.The Pew study doesnt necessarily vindicate Dr. Gouldners entire theory. But it does indicate that the most highly educated professionals are coming to form, if not a new class, at least a reliably liberal political grouping.While theres ample evidence of the professional class using its economic and educational capital to preserve its advantages  think of the clustering of professionals into exclusive neighborhoods, or the early immersion of professional-class children into a world of literacy, art and science  its move left is evident even on questions of economic redistribution. My own analysis of data from the General Social Survey shows that in recent decades, as class inequality has increased, Americans who hold advanced degrees have grown more supportive of government efforts to reduce income differences, whether through changes to taxes or strengthening the welfare system.On this issue, the views of the highly educated are now similar to those of groups with much lower levels of education, who have a real material stake in reducing inequalities. Even higher-income advanced degree holders have become more redistributionist, if less so than others.What explains the consolidation of the highly educated into a liberal bloc? The growing number of women with advanced degrees is part of it, as well-educated women tend to be especially left-leaning. Equally important is the Republican Partys move to the right since the 1980s  at odds with the social liberalism that has long characterized the well educated  alongside the perception that conservatives are anti-intellectual, hostile to science and at war with the university.This phenomenon is mostly a boon for the Democratic Party. While only 10 percent of American adults hold advanced degrees, that number is expected to rise. The group is active politically and influential.But Dr. Gouldners new-class theory should alert Democrats to a lurking danger. It is probably right that something like a culture of critical discourse can be found in the workplaces and households and in the publications read by Americans who have attended graduate or professional school. The challenge for the Democrats moving forward will be to develop appeals to voters that resonate not just with this important constituency, but also with other crucial groups in the Democratic coalition. Some of the draw of Donald Trump for white working-class male voters, for example, is that he does not speak in a culture of critical discourse. Indeed, he mocks that culture, tapping into class resentments.The Democrats may find they need to give up a little of their wonkiness if they want resounding victories. Its not in their long-term interest to be too much what Pat Buchanan once referred to as the party of the Ph.D.s."}
{"text": "In Wednesdays season finale of WGN Americas Underground, escaped slave Noah (Aldis Hodge), gives a stirring speech about justice. I want to be counted, he says. Its our hands that built this country. Its our blood thats running through the heart of it. We keep it beating! Seem to me that make me more American than any of you.Its a powerful speech, and Mr. Hodge is typically magnetic. But just as striking is what hes doing as he says it: brandishing a revolver in each hand, Tarantino-style, holding off a room full of white men as he raids a U.S. marshals lockup to free a group of fellow slaves. Its a fiery political statement, in the middle of a hard-core action scene.Thats Underground. The show, recently renewed for a second season, began with a challenge: making a serial drama about a historical atrocity that both does it justice and competes with escapist entertainment.Americans are used to seeing slavery as a weighty subject for weighty works (12 Years a Slave, Beloved). At the end of the month, the History channel will air Roots, a remake of the landmark 1977 mini-series that traced slavery through one family, whose final episode drew an audience estimated at 100 million people.The remake will simulcast on other A&E networks, but it will not draw anything like that viewership, because nothing does now. Underground came to life on a niche channel in an age of niches, a series about a monumental subject airing at a time when TV rarely delivered monumental statements. In creating it, Misha Green and Joe Pokaski made a simple but in retrospect ingenious decision. They didnt make a statement. They made a TV show.Underground follows the Macon Seven, a band of runaway slaves from Georgia, including Noah and Rosalee (Jurnee Smollett-Bell). It doesnt slight the enormity of enslavement and slaveholding. But its also an entertainment  an action drama, a bloody heist caper with hateable villains and heroes in extremis.Thats a smart commercial choice for a series that might run several seasons, but its also a philosophy: It gives the characters agency, makes them actors rather than simply acted-upon. Even the slaves who dont run, in particular Rosalees mother, Ernestine (Amirah Vann), make choices and take action, in her case protecting her family by maintaining a relationship with the slave master, Tom (Reed Diamond).Underground made many choices that made it more immediate by making it less grandiose. The soundtrack, overseen by John Legend, included contemporary hip-hop, like Kanye Wests Black Skinhead. The music made a statement: This was then, and this is also now. It placed us in the action rather than at a remove from it.The pace was fast; Underground ran like someone was chasing it. It killed off characters like a series that didnt expect to see its second year. It didnt always work; sometimes the show crashed full-on into melodrama. But it could downshift impressively too, especially in Cradle  one of the best episodes of TV so far this year  which surveyed the corrosive effects of the human-bondage system on children, slave and free.The renewal for a second season was good news for fans but worrisome for anyone invested in these characters. The series was, after all, largely about a group of people trying to escape a living hell  one that, in reality, people were born and died in for generations. Given the needs of series television, would Underground tease the Macon Seven with freedom, while finding ways to jeopardize them again and again, like an antebellum  Walking Dead?Instead, the finale saw Rosalee make it to freedom, then return, willingly, with the abolitionists. (As she said to Noah earlier in the episode: Aint none of us free until we all free.)The final scene both points to the second seasons direction and manages a lucky timeliness, as Rosalee is helped out of the wagon she was stowed in by Harriet  as in Tubman. (Shes played here by Kesha Bullard Lewis; according to WGN, the role has yet to be permanently cast for the second season, in which shell have a significant part.)Backlit by the sun, hoisting a rifle against her shoulder, Tubman looks fittingly iconic for someone whos about to be memorialized on the $20 bill. But significant as it is for the treasury department to put her on capitalisms flagship bill, money is static. Its as exciting  and essentially American  a tribute for Underground to imagine her as a prime-time action hero."}
{"text": "Embracing the concept of keep the change, the Transportation Security Administration said it collected more than $760,000 in unclaimed cash  mostly loose coins  from travelers who had forgotten the money after passing through airport security in the 2015 fiscal year.The agency said it makes every effort to reunite passengers with items left at the checkpoint, but at times, property or loose change go unclaimed. The coins, for instance, were left behind when passengers emptied their pockets before going through metal detectors.Money from other countries collected over the fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, made up more than $9,200, which was converted to American currency, according to a T.S.A. report in March.What will the agency do with the money? In 2005, Congress gave the T.S.A. the authority to use unclaimed money on security operations.The money came from 114 so-called hub airports, central airports through which flights are routed. Money collected at smaller airports, which are connected to hubs via routes known as spokes, turn over the money they collect to their respective hub.In the New York metropolitan area, Kennedy International Airport reported the highest total of unclaimed funds: $43,715.81. La Guardia Airport reported $23,413.61, and Newark Liberty International Airport raked in $12,846.78.The lowest amount collected at a hub airport was $1.99, at Pago Pago International Airport in American Samoa, according to the T.S.A. figures.USA Today, which reported on the unclaimed money, said that some airports had installed kiosks for passengers to deposit spare change for charitable causes. Denver International Airport collects money for a program to help homeless people, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport accepts donations to support a United Service Organizations program for members of the military and their families.John Dedell, a video conferencing designer from Safety Harbor, Fla., said he flew about once a month for business and puts his loose change in a backpack for safekeeping.It really does not surprise me that people leave loose change behind, he said in an email. People seem to leave all kinds of things, and I dont think there has ever been a trip that I didnt hear Will the person who left ... come back to T.S.A. to retrieve it.A combination of fewer T.S.A.  screeners, tighter budgets, new checkpoint procedures and more passengers has already created long lines at airports around the country.Money left unclaimed has nearly doubled, to $765,759.15 in the 2015 fiscal year from $383,413.79 in the 2008 fiscal year, the T.S.A. report showed. The sum has increased every year except for one since 2008.Look for more loose change to be left behind this summer as air travel reaches its peak. Officials warn of extraordinarily long waits to get through security, which might mean more anxious passengers dashing for their gates and forgetting to pick up their money."}
{"text": "For a number of Times readers, receiving a cancer diagnosis was just the beginning of a long sojourn through the world of new cancer treatments. Some readers found great success with advanced therapies, while others struggled to see whether the treatments offered better results than conventional ones.What follows is a selection of responses we received from readers sharing their stories of navigating the new frontier of oncology. They have been edited and condensed.What is your experience with a new cancer treatment? Keep the conversation going by sharing your thoughts here.An Exceptional Response to a New TherapyI was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer in April 2005. I was 45 and had never smoked, and the youngest of my three children was only 7. The lower lobe of my left lung was removed, followed by four rounds of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, my cancer returned almost immediately. By the summer of 2008, I had more than two dozen tumors throughout both lungs and was told there was nothing more to do and that I had three to five months left to live. My youngest child and I both began counseling to help us prepare for my death. However the biopsy used to confirm metastatic spread revealed a newly identified driver for lung cancer, a gene called ALK. In October 2008, I became the fourth person in the world with non-small-cell lung cancer to take an experimental therapy called crizotinib. I hoped it would extend my life for several months, but instead I had an almost complete response  not a cure, but a respite. Since then, I have returned to chemotherapy briefly and enrolled in two more Phase 1 clinical trials for ALK inhibitors. My cancer is currently stable, and in several weeks I shall watch my youngest child graduate from high school, and in the fall, he will enroll at M.I.T. where he will study human biology with an emphasis on cancer research. We are truly living the dream (Im alive!) made possible only by advances in cancer research. Linnea Olson, 56, Lowell, Mass.Individualized Medicine Can Be LonelyI didnt expect there to be a point in my treatment for Hodgkins lymphoma when my doctor would say: Its really up to you. If there was a correct way, Id decide, but we just dont know, and its not ethical for me to make that decision for you. I was offered a choice to skip radiation, based on a PET scan that showed my cancer had responded quickly to chemotherapy. Using a PET scan to gauge response to treatment, and from there predict individual outcomes, is a new idea. While I was pleased to be offered the best science available, I didnt expect that being at the forefront of personalized medicine would feel so scary and uncertain. I trusted my oncologist completely, but here he was telling me that we faced a choice without a clear answer. Skipping radiation would increase chances that my cancer recurred, but radiation would increase my risk for secondary cancers considerably; my short-term survival rate might be better with radiation, but my long-term prognosis was possibly better without it. I have two toddlers. If my cancer recurred, I might die before they were old enough to remember me, but if I had radiation, I might mortgage everyones future quality of life. Individualized medicine is lonely. If everybody is a case study of one, then the precedent set by others becomes much less reassuring, and while I admired my doctor for admitting the ethical dilemmas inherent in the decision and allowing me the choice, it was a decision I did not feel at all qualified to make. It sounds so good, objectively  treatment just for you!  but my experience of it was terrifying, even with excellent doctors who spent hours of extra time talking through all the variables with me. Hannah Kaplan, 34, MinneapolisFrom a Tragic Car Accident to a Full LifeOn the morning of June 26, 2015, I was on the way to pick up supplies for a wedding I was catering. I was feeling a bit off, but ignored it, thinking I had low blood sugar. A voice popped into my head, however, saying, If you dont pull over right now, you are going to die! As I started to slow down, I experienced a brain seizure, blacked out and ended up in a ditch with a broken back and a totaled car. The police said I should have been killed. A hospital scan revealed I had Stage 4 metastasized melanoma that had traveled from a lymph node in my arm to my brain, causing the seizure. I had no idea I was sick. After much testing, I was put on a trial of two new untested immunotherapy drugs. In three months, scans showed that all of my brain tumors were gone and my lymph nodes were back to normal. On Oct. 1, the F.D.A. approved one of the two immunotherapy drugs they tested on me. Today, my CT and brain M.R.I.s continue to show no evidence of cancer. My back is healed, and Ive returned to living a full life. Linda McCulloch, 58, Sonoma, Calif.Immunotherapy Can Be Hit or MissI have a relatively rare form of esophageal cancer that I have been fighting for three years. Im presently undergoing intense immunotherapy after having numerous rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and a major surgery to fight my disease. Like many others, I have great hope that immunotherapy will be more effective than more conventional cancer treatments used over the years, but theres no doubt that for certain cancers, even immunotherapy is still hit and miss. While new and novel cancer-fighting therapies are beginning to show real effectiveness in treating patients, many doctors who have fought the war on cancer over the years have a lot to learn about the efficacy of new cancer therapies. My own surgeon, one of the leading doctors in his field, as well as the top oncologist he works with, sent me home to die following the surgery he performed on me almost two years ago. They gave me five months to live. They both felt that further chemotherapy or immunotherapy treatments would buy me no more than a few more weeks of life. Im glad I didnt listen too carefully to their wisdom. Otherwise, I wouldnt be here, still in the fight, willing to do whatever it takes to stay alive and support my family as long and as best I can. John Heubusch, 57, Calabasas, Calif.Active and ThrivingI have Stage 4 renal-cell carcinoma. The cancer metastasized to my other kidney and pancreas and was discovered in November 2014, in a follow-up M.R.I. after I had a mass removed in 2011. My options were not good: Surgery, the go-to approach for renal cell carcinoma, which does not respond to either chemotherapy or radiation, was not advised. I am relatively young, and the devastation of removing my pancreas along with multiple other digestive organs would result in a terrible quality of life. My urology surgeon and oncologist hooked me up with a clinical trial for the Genentech drug Atezolizumab. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that shuts down the cancer-defense system. I was initially told the average survival on the trial was 11 months. That was 14 months ago. My side effects are minimal, the cancer is reduced in size and is now stable and I am active and thriving. The team of renal oncology at U.C.S.F. and Kaiser worked together, and everyone is amazed by how well the immunotherapy has worked. I thought I was to die in 2014. Instead, in the last 18 months, I have completely changed my life with mindfulness practice, yoga, acupuncture, and Qi Gong. I fell in love, made new friends and spent wonderful moments with old friends and family. I am planning to travel to Barcelona in October and may live to see my daughter graduate from Stanford next June. I am still here, still alive and in awe of the life Im living. Sally Barros, 54, Oakland, Calif.A Researcher Becomes the PatientMy laboratory at a major cancer center has spent many of the last 24 years studying DNA replication and DNA damage-response pathways that require BRCA proteins, which suppress tumors, as well as PARP (polyADP ribose polymerase) proteins. Ten years ago, I wrote a book chapter in which I predicted (based on preclinical studies) that PARP-inhibiting drugs would one day provide effective treatment of BRCA-positive breast and ovarian cancer. A few short months ago, a drug called olaparib became the first PARP inhibitor approved for treatment of ovarian or breast cancer. Three years ago, I was diagnosed with an aggressive prostate adenocarcinoma caused by a rare BRCA2 mutation, which was most likely inherited from my mother, who died of breast cancer when she was in her 40s. Radiation treatment and treatment with a number of anti-cancer drugs at the cancer center where I work has failed to stop the growth or metastasis of this tumor for more than a few months. My oncologists know very little about BRCA-positive prostate cancer, which is also rare, and had not heard of olaparib. This has occasionally resulted in an unusual and somewhat disorienting experience. Unlike most patients who sit in exam rooms and furiously scribble information relayed by their oncologists, my oncologists are sometimes scribbling information I relay to them, such as how to spell olaparib! After arranging mostly on my own for treatment with olaparib as an experimental drug almost one year ago, tumor progression has been halted, and recent bone scans indicate that my bone metastases are melting away. The success of my treatment reflects, in part, the extraordinary promise of personalized medicine that targets specific cancer-causing mutations, although the role Ive played in my treatment perhaps takes personalized medicine to the extreme.

{"text": "HONG KONG  Just before the Chinese New Year in February, the Stella Xing Ang shoe factory in Dongguan, China, became a casualty of the countrys economic slowdown. Declining orders and higher production costs meant that after 13 years of producing shoes for major international brands, the business would close, and 2,000 employees would lose their jobs.Given the rise in worker activism and labor unrest in China over the last several years, one might have expected the Stella workers to strike or to stage a mass protest in January when the company announced the factory closure. But nothing happened: Most workers seemed happy with the layoff deal offered by management and left their jobs without a fuss.Still, the Stella workers were not meekly acquiescing to their fate. They had been out on strike many times over the past decade, demanding better pay and benefits. It was because of this long history of activism that the managers at Stella made sure the workers were paid everything they were owed before the factory was shuttered.But in thousands of other factory closures across China, owners have been much less compliant with labor regulations. China claims to be a country ruled by law, but the government has routinely failed to ensure that employers honor workers legal rights  and the result has been more protests. The only way to prevent more unrest is, simply, for the government to enforce the laws.There has been a steady rise in the number of strikes and worker protests over the last few years. China Labour Bulletin logged 1,379 incidents in 2014. This doubled to 2,774 in 2015, with 877 incidents recorded in the first quarter of 2016. The single biggest cause of these protests by far is wage arrears. In most cases, employers simply stop paying wages, cut overtime, and generally make life intolerable for the workers so that they choose to leave. If the workers refuse to quit and demand payment, the boss often vanishes, leaving workers out of pocket with nowhere to go.The governments response to more worker activism has been to crack down. Government officials have been warned by superiors that they will lose their jobs if unrest occurs on their watch, and they have responded by threatening striking workers, harassing their families and using riot police to break up protests. In early December, the authorities in Guangdong went one step further and rounded up more than a dozen labor rights professionals, all working in local organizations, who had played a key role in resolving numerous disputes. Two leading activists remain in jail in Guangzhou awaiting trial.The Chinese government is paying the price for decades of not enforcing the regulations that were put in place ostensibly to protect workers. Local officials, eager to attract investment during the boom years, were more than happy to ignore delinquent bosses and often actively conspired in their wrongdoing. The massive Yue Yuen shoe factory Dongguan, for example, had been cheating employees out of their benefits for years with the full knowledge of the local government. Workers only got full payment when 40,000 of them staged a two-week strike in 2014.Employers who were never forced to pay employee benefits during the boom times are not going to suddenly comply when their businesses are in trouble. In the face of an unresponsive government, often the only way for workers to guarantee that delinquent bosses pay up is to take collective action, often with the help of local labor activists  experts in collective bargaining who can organize workers and get employers to negotiate with them. Last year, for example, around 2,000 workers at the Lide shoe factory in Guangzhou staged a nine-month campaign that, after many rounds of collective bargaining, finally convinced management to adhere to its legal obligations.The Panyu Migrant Workers Center, an organization that works with China Labour Bulletin, has been instrumental in helping resolve dozens of labor disputes, such as the Lide strike, by convincing employers to negotiate with the workers. But just six months after the successful resolution of the Lide dispute, the director of the Panyu center, Zeng Feiyang, and two staff members were arrested in the December crackdown on activists. Mr. Zeng and one staffer remain in detention, both charged with gathering a crowd to disturb social order, and the center is effectively closed. The Guangdong authorities have also made life increasingly difficult for the other labor groups in the area, warning them to keep away from disputes or risk arrest.These Guangdong labor professionals have developed a successful method of resolving disputes by organizing workers, helping to frame their demands and to elect representatives who can directly bargain with management. Without the moderating influence of these collective bargaining experts, there is a danger that frustrated and angry workers will resort to more extreme  or even violent  measures to pursue their cause, precisely the outcome the Chinese government is desperate to avoid.Mr. Zeng and his colleagues have done far more to honor Chinas labor laws than the government officials who now seem determined to put them out of business. Instead of punishing and vilifying these activists, the Chinese government should learn from their example and ensure that the laws on the books are actually enforced. Making employers follow labor regulations would lead to a more content work force  and thats in the interest of the government and the Chinese people."}
{"text": "This seems to be the week for Trump tax mysteries. One mystery is why Donald Trump, unlike every other major party nominee in modern times, is refusing to release his tax returns. The other is why, having decided that he needs experts to clean up his ludicrous tax-cut proposals, he chose to call on the services of the gang that couldnt think straight.On the first mystery: Mr. Trumps excuse, that he cant release his returns while theyre being audited, is an obvious lie. On the contrary, the fact that hes being audited (or at least that he says hes being audited) should make it easier for him to go public  after all, he neednt fear triggering an audit! Clearly, he must be hiding something. What?It could be how little he pays in taxes, a revelation that hurt Mitt Romney in 2012. But I doubt it; given how Mr. Trump rolls, hed probably boast that his ability to game the tax system shows how smart he is compared to all the losers out there.So my guess, shared by a number of observers, is that the dirty secret hidden in those returns is that he isnt as rich as he claims to be. In Trumpworld, the revelation that hes only worth a couple of billion  maybe even less than a billion  would be utterly humiliating. So hell try to tough it out. Of course, if he does, well never know.Meanwhile, however, we can look at the candidates policy proposals. And what has been going on there is just as revealing, in its own way, as his attempt to dodge scrutiny of his personal finances.The story so far: Last fall Mr. Trump suggested that he would break with Republican orthodoxy by raising taxes on the wealthy. But then he unveiled a tax plan that would, in fact, lavish huge tax cuts on the rich. And it would also, according to nonpartisan analyses, cause deficits to explode, adding around $10 trillion to the national debt over a decade.Now, the inconsistency between Mr. Trumps rhetoric and his specific proposals didnt seem to hurt him in the Republican primaries. Neither did the wild irresponsibility of those specifics, perhaps because all the major contenders for the G.O.P. nomination were proposing huge, budget-busting tax cuts for the rich. True, none of them were quite as off the charts as the Trump plan, but such distinctions were probably lost on primary voters  $4 trillion, $10 trillion, who cares?Having secured the nomination, however, Mr. Trump apparently feels the need to seem more respectable. The goal, I suspect, is to bring the headline numbers down enough to let the medias propensity for false equivalence kick in. Hillary Clinton has a plan that actually adds up, while Donald Trump has a plan that will cost $4 trillion, but which he claims is deficit-neutral? Hey, its the same thing!Oh, and meanwhile he suggested once again that he might raise taxes on the rich, then walked it back, with credulous media eating it all up.But whats really interesting is whom, according to Politico, Mr. Trump has brought in to revise his plans: Larry Kudlow of CNBC and Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation. That news had economic analysts spitting out their morning coffee all across America.For those who dont follow such things, Mr. Kudlow has a record of being wrong about, well, everything. In 2005 he ridiculed bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Florida, to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy, and the entire stock market  which was exactly what happened. In 2007 he predicted three years of Goldilocks prosperity. And on and on.Mr. Moore has a comparable forecasting record, but he also has a remarkable inability to get facts straight. Perhaps most famously, he once attempted to rebut, well, me with an article detailing the supposed benefits of state tax cuts; incredibly, not one of the many numbers in that article was right.So why would Mr. Trump turn to these of all people to, ahem, fix his numbers?It could be a peace offering, an attempt to reassure insiders by bringing in Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore, who are influential members of the Republican establishment  which incidentally tells you a lot about their party.But my guess is that the explanation is simpler: The candidate has no idea who is and isnt competent. I mean, its not as if he has any independent knowledge of economics, or even knows what he doesnt know. For example, he keeps asserting that America has the worlds highest taxes, when were actually at the bottom among advanced nations.So he probably just went with a couple of guys hes seen on TV, assuming that they must be there because they know their stuff.Now, you might wonder how someone that careless and incurious was such a huge success in business. But one answer is, how successful was he, really? Whats in those tax returns?"}
{"text": "DAKAR, Senegal  A suicide bomber who was stopped from entering a government compound killed at least six people, including two police officers, on Thursday in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram was suspected. Maiduguri was the birthplace of Boko Haram and has been the scene of numerous attacks by the groups fighters in the past seven years.In recent weeks, the Nigerian militarys operations against the group had kept fighters out of the city center for the most part and residents had been starting to look ahead to a possible end of the long war with the militants.But the attack Thursday, which also wounded more than a dozen people, shattered the citys fragile sense of calm.The bomber, who was riding a tricycle taxi, was stopped around noon outside a heavily guarded complex of government offices in the city center, officials said. He then set off his explosives, killing two police officers and at least four other people.Tricycle taxis  yellow, motorized and covered  have replaced motorbikes, which the government banned in the city several years ago because Boko Haram was using them for drive-by shootings and suicide attacks.The attack came a day after two separate bombings in the area, witnesses said. The first was at a mosque and killed only the bomber, but the second killed four people.The Nigerian Army said in a statement that the situation in Maiduguri had reinforced the need for more security consciousness and awareness on the part of all of us.The remnants of the Boko Haram terrorists and their sympathizers still mingle with the society, the statement said."}
{"text": "CANNES, France  A day after his latest film, Caf Society, opened the Cannes Film Festival to respectful reviews, Woody Allen said he had no comment on a column in The Hollywood Reporter, posted on Wednesday by his estranged son, Ronan Farrow, accusing him of abuse and criticizing the news media for not taking the claims more seriously.My comment is that Ive said everything that I have to say about that silly situation in The New York Times, Mr. Allen said at a press lunch on Thursday, seeming unflappable and unsurprised by the questions. He was referring to a 2014 Op-Ed article in which he denied accusations by his adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, that he had abused her when she was a child. Mr. Farrow is Dylans brother and Mr. Allens son from his relationship with Mia Farrow.Ive said all I can say about it, Mr. Allen added. I have so moved on that I never think about it. I work, I do my movies and hope that people like them.At the festivals opening ceremony on Wednesday, Mr. Allen, 80, was also the target of a joke by the evenings M.C., the French comedian Laurent Lafitte, that shocked some in the audience.Youve shot so many of your films here in Europe, and yet in the United States, you havent even been convicted of rape, Mr. Lafitte said, addressing Mr. Allen and apparently referring to the director Roman Polanski, who left the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a minor. He served some jail time but fled before final sentencing.(Mr. Lafitte appears in Elle, Paul Verhoevens latest feature, which is in competition here this year and stars Isabelle Huppert as a woman who takes matters into her own hands after being raped.)At a dinner after the ceremony on Wednesday, some American film industry professionals said they had been taken aback by the joke.Asked about it at the press lunch on Thursday, Mr. Allen told a group of journalists, It would take a lot to offend me, The Guardian reported.Caf Society, set in the 1930s between Hollywood and New York, and starring Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Steve Carell, Corey Stoll and Blake Lively, has received mixed but generally positive reviews. Some critics have called it one of Mr. Allens better recent films, with strong performances by the leads, but others have found its love triangle plot a bit tired."}
{"text": "Film history is filled with movies that have been mangled by their producers, maladroitly distributed and generally born under a bad sign  they are often misunderstood by critics and consequently difficult to see. But these films also hold a special place in cinephile hearts.Such films maudit (cursed films), as the French call them, can be cultist holy grails. Samuel Fullers German telefilm Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street (1972) is one. Ivan Passers thriller Cutters Way (1981) is another.Out on disc from Olive Films in a directors cut some 25 minutes longer than its United States release version, Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street was the first movie that Mr. Fuller  a prolific writer-director of offbeat, wildly energetic action films  made in full awareness of his paradoxical status. While washed up in Hollywood, he had become a revered figure first for French and later German and American new wave filmmakers.Given the opportunity to direct an episode for the West German TV series Tatort (Crime Scene), Mr. Fuller appears to have enjoyed creative carte blanche, writing what he called a cartoon caper movie concerning an international blackmail ring in Cologne. The outfit, led by an icy professional fencer, specializes in photographing politicians in compromising positions. Intrigue follows when the ring is infiltrated by an American private eye (Glenn Corbett) representing one of the victims.Dead Pigeon is self-consciously trendy in its percussive zoom shots and hyperkinetic montages, as well as casually outlandish in its locations (a shootout in a maternity ward; a cloak-and-dagger rendezvous at the Beethoven-Haus museum in Bonn; Colognes annual carnival, in which a killer clown lurks among the costumed participants). A wink away from self-parody, Mr. Fuller evokes his own oeuvre throughout, quoting lines and recreating bits of business from previous movies. Not all are his. At one point, Mr. Corbett ducks into a movie house showing Rio Bravo and cracks up at the spectacle of John Wayne speaking perfect German.The self-referential casting also has new wave flavor. The director Claude Chabrols muse Stphane Audran is given a cameo as a glamorous lesbian named Dr. Bogdanovich (a nod to the director Peter Bogdanovich). The German filmmaker Peter Lilienthal is also present, and in his memoir A Third Face, Mr. Fuller writes that R. W. Fassbinder tried to talk his way into a part. Mr. Fuller himself appears briefly as a blackmailed American senator, but mainly Dead Pigeon is a valentine addressed to Mr. Fullers wife, the German actress Christa Lang, playing an actress turned femme fatale named Christa.As personal as it is, Dead Pigeon often feels like a home movie or even a low-budget avant-garde production. Barely distributed in the United States, it even appeared in that context. I first saw Dead Pigeon in late 1976. The packed one-off screening at the Collective for Living Cinema, a quasi-underground venue in Lower Manhattan, may actually have been the movies New York theatrical premiere. Back then, I found Dead Pigeon disappointing; seen again, as the filmmaker intended it and without expectation, its less a failure than a small, unexpected gift for Mr. Fullers fans.A far better movie, Cutters Way (released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time) is a classic hard-luck story. Although comparable to classic early 70s downers like Chinatown and The Long Goodbye, this story of three post-hippie losers drawn by chance and paranoia into a sordid murder mystery was born too late and has never gotten the recognition it deserves.Mr. Passer, an migr from Czechoslovakia who came to America in the aftermath of the 1968 Soviet invasion, treats Jeffrey Alan Fiskins script with a mixture of humanist warmth, caustic humor and detached fatalism. The director is fond of his doomed characters and, as in his lone Czech production, the rueful comedy Intimate Lighting (1965), he does not judge so much as observe them.As Mr. Fuller incorporates Colognes carnival revelry, Mr. Passer seizes on the surreal facade of the Old Spanish Days celebration in Santa Barbara, Calif. Rather than a salute to local history, the fiesta feels like a cover-up of fat-cat malfeasance. Jordan Cronenweths magic-hour cinematography distills the golden California sunlight into an atmosphere of malign ripeness. The movies gimlet-eyed mise-en-scne is exceeded only by the flamboyance of John Heards career performance as a raspy-voiced madman who lost an arm, a leg, an eye and possibly his mind in Vietnam.Mr. Heards furious pinwheel of resentment is supported, if not stabilized, by Lisa Eichhorns self-effacing portrayal of his alcoholic wife and Jeff Bridgess turn as their self-loathing best friend, an unenthusiastic boat salesman who moonlights as a penny-ante gigolo. The three might as well be occupying Santa Barbara as if it were Zuccotti Park.Once intended as a vehicle for Dustin Hoffman, Cutters Way was a casualty of Heavens Gate, a costly Michael Cimino western blamed for fatally damaging its studio, United Artists. Mr. Passers budget was cut, and once his supporters at United Artists left, his film  originally titled Cutter and Bone  was dumped into release with only two hastily scheduled previews and minimal publicity. Panned by three New York City dailies as well as by local TV, the movie was yanked from theaters before the favorable notices from the weeklies arrived.The Village Voice, where I was third-string film critic, was a particular champion. An initial enthusiastic review employing the newly minted term neo noir to characterize the movies attitude was followed by a second positive review, as well as a profile of Mr. Passer when Cutters Way reopened a few months later under its new title. Nothing helped.Appearing at the dawn of Ronald Reagans new morning, Mr. Passers movie was a hopeless outlier. And so, despite intermittent shout-outs, it remains maudit, even as its anti-corporate populism is now in vogue.NEWLY RELEASEDARABIAN NIGHTS Three films or one, Miguel Gomess tripartite portrait of contemporary Portugal can be seen as documented fantasy or fantastic documentary.

{"text": "BRASLIA  After an all-night debate, Brazils Senate voted Thursday morning to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and begin an impeachment trial against her, ousting a deeply unpopular leader whose sagging political fortunes have come to embody widespread public anger over systemic corruption and a battered economy.In a vote of 55 to 22, lawmakers accepted the charges against Ms. Rousseff, accusing her of borrowing from state banks to conceal a looming deficit, a budgetary sleight of hand that critics say was aimed at securing her re-election two years ago.We could no longer ignore these crimes and thus voted for impeachment, lvaro Dias, a senator from the Green Party, said shortly before casting his vote. Having been assaulted by incompetence and wrongdoing, Brazilians expect punishment.During her impeachment trial, which could last six months, Ms. Rousseff will be replaced by a onetime ally, Vice President Michel Temer, who has been convicted of violating campaign finance limits and will now be under tremendous pressure to stem Brazils worst economic crisis in decades.Describing the effort to remove her as a coup, Ms. Rousseff, the first woman to be president of Brazil, has repeatedly rejected calls to resign, vowing to continue her fight to stay at the helm of Latin Americas largest country, the worlds fifth-most populous.The struggle for democracy doesnt have an end date, she said in a speech Thursday, shortly before vacating the presidential office. Its a permanent fight that requires our constant dedication. Its a fight that can be won, and it is one we will win.But given the margin of opposition against her on Thursday, political analysts said she stood little chance of winning the trial and finishing the remaining two and a half years of her final term in office.Given the polarization in Brazil, if she sticks to her guns and fights this all the way to the end, its going to prolong the agony for the country, said Mauro F. Guilln, a professor of international management at the University of Pennsylvania. The best thing she could do for her country is to bite the bullet and step aside.Months of ugly invective, secret maneuvering and legal appeals have divided a nation already buffeted by inflation, government paralysis and a colossal corruption scandal that revealed the depths of Brazils profoundly troubled political system.Though widely expected, the spectacle of Ms. Rousseffs being put on trial is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, which experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.Now, those gains are coming undone, with millions of working-class Brazilians sinking into poverty as the country endures its second year of recession.The nations economic woes are not simply a result of falling global prices for Brazilian commodities like oil and soybeans. They are also self-inflicted, economists say, a consequence of flawed policies and enormous graft scandals. Many voters blame Ms. Rousseff and her leftist Workers Party.Everything is so expensive now, we can barely afford to eat, said Juliana Santos, 29, a ticket-taker who works for a public bus company in Braslia, the capital. The Workers Party promised they would change things, but they changed things for the worse.The bitter political feud among Brazils scandal-plagued leaders is taking place as the country struggles to contain the spread of the Zika virus, and just months before the world heads to Rio de Janeiro for the Summer Olympics.Plainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards, Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the countrys grim mood.Ms. Rousseff, 68, is the second Brazilian president to face impeachment since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.In 1992, Fernando Collor de Mello resigned before the Senate could try him on charges of corruption. But he has resurrected his political career and is now a senator. In the debate, he criticized his ouster decades ago, before voting against Ms. Rousseff.Compared with the raucous debate over Ms. Rousseffs fate in the lower house of Congress last month  during which lawmakers spit on one another, jeered and threw confetti  the proceedings in the Senate were subdued.After 20 hours of often-somnolent speechmaking, the Brazilian solicitor general, Jos Eduardo Cardozo, took to the dais just after dawn on Thursday and told lawmakers that history would judge them harshly if they voted to try Ms. Rousseff for a crime he said she had not committed. If this impeachment goes forward, Brazil will become the worlds largest banana republic, he said, emotion filling his voice.Throughout the day, the corrugated-metal enclosures that had been erected outside Congress to contain protesters remained mostly empty, a marked contrast to the thousands of people who flocked to the capital last month to express their support or opposition during the impeachment vote in the lower house.By evening on Wednesday, several hundred people had gathered in the pens, and at one point, police officers fired tear gas into a crowd of anti-impeachment protesters after firecrackers were lobbed in the officers direction.Ms. Rousseff is a former Marxist guerrilla and a trained economist who spent years working in the nations energy bureaucracies. She had not held elected office until former President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who was constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, picked her to be his successor.In 2010, she won handily, and during her time in office, she largely continued the generous social welfare programs that had earned Mr. da Silva unswerving loyalty from the countrys poorest citizens.Our greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class, Mr. da Silva said in an email on Wednesday. We remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.But as the economy soured and scandal rocked the political establishment, Ms. Rousseffs popularity sank into the single digits, giving her adversaries in Congress an opening to seek her removal.It was the recent defection of Mr. Temer that helped seal her fate, providing opponents in the lower house the crucial bloc of votes they needed to push forward with impeachment.But Mr. Temer may be even less popular than Ms. Rousseff, with one recent poll finding that only 2 percent of Brazilians would vote for him. He also faces his own legal problems. An electoral court ordered him this month to pay a fine for violating campaign finance limits. The ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician barred from campaigning ends up running the country.Fixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75. Critics have expressed concern over some of his top advisers, several of whom are under investigation, including Romero Juc, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazils largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.Many business leaders and economists have expressed hope that Mr. Temer will win congressional support for changes like reducing federal pensions, privatizing state-owned companies and amending labor laws that critics say hamper economic growth.Temer has 100 days to get the ball rolling and address this disaster, said Marcos Troyjo, a co-director of the BRICLab at Columbia University, which focuses on Brazil, Russia, India and China.Despite the charges against her, Ms. Rousseff is rare among top politicians in Brazil in that she has not faced accusations of illegally enriching herself.Eduardo Cunha, the powerful speaker of the lower house, who led the impeachment effort, was ordered by the Supreme Court to step down last week to face trial on charges that he pocketed as much as $40 million in bribes.His replacement, Waldir Maranho, is accused of taking bribes in the enormous graft scheme surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras. And Renan Calheiros, the Senate leader, is under investigation over claims that he received bribes in the scandal, too. He has also been accused of tax evasion and of allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter from an extramarital affair.Though badly weakened, leaders from Ms. Rousseffs party are determined to remain a thorn in the side of the incoming government, which many believe is illegitimate. Speaking to reporters outside the Senate chamber on Wednesday, Senator Humberto Costa, leader of the Workers Party caucus, said he was left with no choice but to embrace obstructionism.We will treat them to the kind of stiff opposition they imposed on our government, he said. There is no other path for us."}

{"text": "I always knew I wanted to try alcohol. It represented independence and sophistication. It was about breaking the rules and having fun, and as a teenager, I wanted nothing else. But I had never even seen alcohol in real life. I had only seen a photo of an alcoholic drink in a frayed photo album: It was of my father, with a big smile on his face, in a cabaret in Tehran before the revolution.By the time I was born, long after the establishment of the Islamic republic in Iran and the prohibition of alcohol, my father had joined the Iranian military, and it was impossible to have alcohol in our home. So it wasnt until I was 19 and in school at the University of Tehran that I had my first drink.At the university, it seemed to me that most of the students there had already started drinking. And in that typical way of a teenager, I felt left out. I knew I wanted to drink; I just didnt know how it would happen. I wasnt friends with the students who could freely drink at home with their parents, and I hadnt yet been invited to the house parties where alcohol was served.Then one spring day, my boyfriend, A., asked me if I wanted to drink with him. I was very much in love with him and didnt want him to think I was nave, so I tried to act casual when I said yes.Great! he said, promising to bring something to school the next week.At the university? I asked him in disbelief.But it made sense. A. didnt have his own place, and our parents wouldnt have allowed us to have each other over (throughout our five-year relationship, my parents never knew he existed). Like many couples of our generation in Iran, we struggled to find time alone. The university was the only place we could be together for long periods. A. said we would find a place to drink together in the park next to our main building, where my girlfriends and I often hid to smoke cigarettes.Even though I tried to act cool, I worried about handling the effects of alcohol. I was scared that the university guards would catch us and that wed be expelled, maybe much worse  a lashing is the punishment under Islamic law. And yet there was something about being at the university, with all those rules, that made such brashly illegal acts so very desirable.One day the next week, A. whispered to me with a big smile that he had it. He told me to meet him at 3 in the afternoon. I had butterflies all morning and couldnt concentrate in any of my classes. We met up and walked to the park next to the university. After we found a secluded bench far from the guards, A. pulled out a Sprite bottle from his book bag; he had filled it with moonshine in the dormitory the night before. The mens dorm was always less strict than ours. They werent checked by the guards at the doors, so they smuggled in alcohol, cigarettes, weed, hash, opium, anything you can imagine. It was safer to drink and do drugs there because no one would tell the guards. But women were checked when they entered their dorms, and my hall mates constantly ratted out my friends and me just for smoking cigarettes.A. pulled out a disposable cup and poured. He took a few sips before offering it to me. I kept looking around to make sure no guards were walking by. I nervously took a very small sip and then waited. I thought something would happen to me right away. But nothing did, and so I drank a bit more. I took an even bigger gulp, until A. told me to slow down. By that point, I knew he had figured out that this was my first time.We drank the bottle together that afternoon, and we had a blast. We joked and told each other stories until the guards told us with sour faces to leave so they could close the university gates. We were so tipsy and in such a good mood that we didnt even mind their bad attitude. A. often snapped back at the guards  he hated how stern they were with all of us  but he laughed that day, throwing his arms up triumphantly and saying: Take it easy, man. Its not that serious. Were leaving. I leaned into him, resting my head on his shoulder, and we went off arm in arm as if nothing were amiss.After giggling all the way to our usual spot to get something to eat, A. walked me back to my dorm before our curfew at 9. A block away, he squeezed my hand and gave me a wink. Looking back on it now, I know that we didnt even have that much to drink, but I felt so lightheaded and giddy and free.After that, A. brought alcohol to campus a few more times, and I befriended a classmate who had her own apartment and great parties with lots of alcohol. But that first time is etched in my memory  doing it in such a public way on the university grounds. I would never do that today. I was much less fearful then."}

{"text": "In this, our last Poetry Pairing for the school year, Marianne Moores That Harp You Play So Well is matched with the essay Sing to Me, O Muse (But Keep It Brief), by David Lehman.Stay tuned for the winners of our Seventh Annual Found Poem Challenge, coming later this month.To view all of the Poetry Pairings weve published in collaboration with the Poetry Foundation since 2010, and to find activity sheets to help with teaching them, visit our collection.Editor of the influential literary magazine The Dial and author of several collections, Marianne Moore achieved both literary success and a degree of celebrity, famous for her tricorn hat and cape.That Harp You Play So Well\nBy Marianne MooreFrom Pouters and FantailsOh, David, if I had\nYour power, I should be glad\n  In harping, with the sling,\n  In patient reasoning!Blake, Homer, Job and you,\nHave made old wine-skins new.\n   Your energies have wrought\n   Stout continents of thought.But David, if the heart\nBe brass, what boots the art\n   Of exorcizing wrong,\n   Of harping to a song?The sceptre and the ring\nAnd every royal thing\n    Will fail. Griefs lustiness\n    Must cure that harps distress.In the 2014 Sunday Book Review essay Sing to Me, O Muse (But Keep It Brief), David Lehman writes about what could be lost in a technology-oriented culture.Maybe I dreamed it. Don Draper sips Canadian Club from a coffee mug on Craig Fergusons late-night talk show. Are you on Twitter? the host asks. No, Draper says. I dont  he pauses before pronouncing the distasteful verb  tweet. Next question. Do you read a lot of poetry? Though the hero of Mad Men is seen reading Dantes Inferno in one season of the show and heard reciting Frank OHara in another, the question seems to come from left field. Poetry isnt really celebrated anymore in our culture, Draper says, to which Ferguson retorts, It can be  if you can write in units of 140 keystrokes. Commercial break.The laugh line reveals a shrewd insight into the subject of poetry in the digital age, a panel-discussion perennial. The participants agree that texting and blogs will influence the practice of poetry in style, content and method of composition. Surely we may expect the same of a wildly popular social medium with a formal requirement as stringent as the 140-character limit. (To someone with a streak of mathematical mysticism, the relation of that number to the number of lines in a sonnet is a thing of beauty.) What Twitter offers is ultimate immediacy expressed with ultimate concision. Whatever else Twitter is, its a literary form, the critic Kathryn Schulz has written. True, the hard-to-shake habit causes its share of problems, distractibility increase and other disturbing symptoms. Nevertheless there is a reason Schulz got hooked on this wide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, bighearted, super fun activity.The desire to make a friend of the new technology obliges us to overlook some major flaws: The Internet is hell on lining, spacing, italics; line breaks and indentation are often obscured in electronic transmission. The integrity of the poetic line can be a serious casualty. Still, it is fruitless to quarrel with the actuality of change, though in private we may revel in our physical books and even, if we like, write with pencil on graph paper or type our thoughts with the Smith-Corona to which we have a sentimental attachment. One room in the 2013 Drawn to Language exhibit at the University of Southern Californias Fisher Museum of Art was devoted to Susan Siltons site-specific installation of a circle of tables on which sat 10 manual typewriters of different vintages. It was moving to behold the machines not only as objects of nostalgia in an attractive arrangement but as metonymies of the experience of writing in the 20th century. Seeing the typewriters in that room, I felt as I do when the talk touches on the acquisition of an authors papers by a university library. Its odd to be a member of the last generation to have papers in this archival and material sense. Odd for an era to slip into a museum while you watch.The one-minute poem may not be far off. With its need for speed, Twitters 140-character constraint brings the clock into the game. Poetry  a byte-size kind of poetry  has been, or soon will be, a benefit of attention deficit disorder. (This prediction is not necessarily made in disparagement.) Unlike the telephone, social media relies on the written, not the spoken, word, and I wonder what will happen when hip-hop and spoken-word practices tangle with the virtues of concision, bite and wit consistent with the rules of the Twitter feed. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the sentence I have just composed will be anachronistic in a couple of years. Among my favorite oxymorons is ancient computer, applied to my own desktop.Here are two activity sheets you can use with any edition of this feature  and you might also check out the Poetry Foundations page of Articles for Teachers and Students:That Harp You Play So Well appeared in the May 1915 issue of Poetry, and is among Marianne Moores first published poems."}
{"text": "It began with great fanfare in the spring of 2014. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined forces to help elect a Democratic majority in the New York State Senate, a goal to which Mr. Cuomo had paid lip service but had done little to achieve.It did not, however, end well.The Republicans prevailed on Election Day, weeks after the unusual alliance between the governor and the mayor ruptured amid accusations that Mr. Cuomo was sabotaging the effort. The Democratic Senate candidates were not the only losers: Eighteen months later, Mr. de Blasio and several aides, along with a number of consultants and labor union operatives, find themselves caught up in a criminal investigation focused on how they directed money into some of the contested races.The inquiry focuses squarely on the de Blasio teams effort to use county committees to deliver more money than would be allowed through contribution caps that apply to individual candidates.But the Cuomo campaign was nonetheless involved in the overall effort to help the Democrats retake the Senate, at least behind the scenes, according to documents and correspondence reviewed by The New York Times, and to people briefed on the effort.Meetings were held, plans drawn up and lawyers consulted. And perhaps most important, money was raised  in the end, well over $1 million.A senior aide to the governor, Joseph Percoco, took part in some of the earliest organizational and planning sessions with a top de Blasio administration official and campaign lawyers for the mayor and the governor, the materials reviewed by The Times show.Mr. Percoco also received central legal and operational documents on how the fund-raising effort would be carried out. Three weeks before the election, he corresponded with Emma Wolfe, one of the mayors closest advisers, about the procedures for paying for hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign advertisements and mailings for Democratic candidates in targeted races, according to the materials.The disclosures seem to suggest that Mr. Percoco, who was one of the governors most trusted senior staff members until he left the administration in January, may have been aware of some of the conduct that is now under scrutiny, and that is at the heart of the fund-raising inquiry. His lawyer, Barry A. Bohrer, declined to comment.Basil A. Smikle Jr., the executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, which took part in the effort and is controlled by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that neither the state party nor the governors campaign took part in the fund-raising activities that are now under scrutiny.Mr. Smikle said that Mr. Percoco, Ms. Wolfe and others were clearly advised by legal counsel that fund-raising earmarking was a circumvention of the states campaign finance limits. Eventually, the coordinated effort became divided after internal strategic and operational disagreements, he said. Citing published reports, Mr. Smikle added that the mayors group is now under investigation, suspected of using earmarked funds through the Democratic county committees of Ulster and Putnam Counties.An election lawyer for the mayor, Laurence D. Laufer, who advised on the Senate effort, dismissed Mr. Smikles version of events.There was clear legal guidance provided to all parties that was rigorously adhered to, he said in a statement provided by Mr. de Blasios campaign. The notion that the state party had concerns about any legal issue, or backed away from the effort because of that, is patently ridiculous.The state party, according to correspondence reviewed by The Times, continued to pay roughly $1 million for television commercials, mailings and consultants as part of the effort up until the final weeks before the election, with most of that money raised by Mr. de Blasio.The mayor, a Democrat, has repeatedly defended the fund-raising campaign, saying in a recent radio interview, We specifically followed  every step along the way  legal guidance. He and others have said political campaigns have used similar practices for decades.The criminal investigation, by the office of the Manhattan district attorney and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is focused on allegations that the mayor, his aides and a team of consultants and labor union representatives whom he assembled sought to use county committees and the New York State Democratic Senate Campaign Committee to evade the $10,300 limit on donations to individual candidates. County committees can receive contributions of $102,300.It is a felony for donors to earmark contributions to the committees to be passed on to certain candidates. Prosecutors involved in the investigation interpret the statute, which has never been tested in court, to mean that it is also a felony under state election law to solicit donations in order to avoid contribution limits, people briefed on the matter have said, an interpretation that Mr. de Blasios campaign lawyers dispute.No evidence has been uncovered that Mr. Percoco did anything illegal or improper as part of the fund-raising efforts, people briefed on the matter said; he is the target of an unrelated federal corruption investigation focused on the governors largest economic development project, known as the Buffalo Billion.At the time of the fund-raising effort, Mr. Percoco resigned as the governors deputy executive secretary so he could serve as the manager of Mr. Cuomos 2014 re-election campaign.Among the materials The Times reviewed was a July 16, 2014, document prepared as part of that years Senate campaign effort that summarized the fund-raising and spending rules that would apply to the coordinated effort. It listed the contribution limits and restrictions on funds for five recipient committees that could be used in the undertaking. They included the county committees, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the New York State Democratic Committee, which is controlled by Mr. Cuomo.The inclusion of another committee, the Womens Party multicandidate political committee, also underscored the governors influence. That committee, created and controlled by Mr. Cuomo, would later be named the Womens Equality Party. For reasons that are unclear, the Womens Equality Party was apparently not used in the effort.Mr. Percoco and a legal adviser for the State Democratic Party attended one of the fund-raising efforts early planning meetings, on July 16 at the Lower Manhattan office of the law firm Genova Burns Giantomasi Webster, according to the documents, correspondence and people briefed on the effort.Among others in attendance were Ms. Wolfe and Mr. Laufer, who represents Mr. de Blasios successful 2013 mayoral campaign, his current re-election campaign and the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit that has pushed his agenda. Mr. Laufer, who was then with the Genova firm, also represents some of the other entities involved in the 2014 fund-raising effort.The materials reviewed by The Times also included a brief legal analysis, prepared by Mr. Laufer and dated Oct. 8, 2014, which concluded that the fund-raising effort was not engaging in earmarking; the other, dated Oct. 17, was a longer, more detailed examination of election law relating to the fund-raising operation, which said it was written to provide guidance to ensure the campaign was carried out in compliance with the law.The investigation is one of at least five separate corruption inquiries focused on the mayor and his inner circle, people with knowledge of those inquiries have said.The 2014 Senate materials reviewed by The Times also show that Mr. Percoco was involved until at least mid-October, when correspondence with Ms. Wolfe shows that the two were negotiating over how to track and pay some of the roughly $1 million in television advertising and mailings.Mr. Percocos role in helping the Senate Democrats, elements of which were reported by Politico New York, ran counter to Mr. Cuomos actions in the past; despite his promises of support, he did little that year to publicly assist the Democratic candidates.Other questions about the investigation, including whether it may expand beyond violations of election law or remain narrowly focused on those allegations, remain. Prosecutors have subpoenaed several of the mayors senior aides and the finance chairman of his campaign, as well as a number of consultants who worked on the effort who are very close to the mayor, according to City Hall officials and others briefed on the inquiry. Democratic candidates from the 2014 race have also received subpoenas, as have some of the county committees.While the ultimate outcome of this particular investigation is uncertain, a number of political consultants and lawyers involved in the inquiry say one thing is clear: The investigation, along with the others swirling around the mayor, will not make fund-raising for him any easier in this election season."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump, who has admitted in the past to sometimes employing a pseudonym in which he pretended to be a spokesman for himself, insisted in an interview with NBCs Today show on Friday that an audiotape from 1991 featuring a man claiming to be Mr. Trumps spokesman was not him.The audio of the interview with a People magazine reporter, obtained by The Washington Post, sounded similar to Mr. Trumps cadences. At one point, the speaker  who was discussing Mr. Trumps divorce from his first wife, Ivana, in detail  used the first person when answering a question that was about the developer.When pressed about it by Savannah Guthrie on Today whether it was him, Mr. Trump said: I dont think it, I dont know anything about it. Youre telling me about it for the first time and it doesnt sound like my voice at all. I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that, and this sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. Doesnt sound like me.Mr. Trump insisted again: It was not me on the phone. And when was this, 25 years ago?Ms. Guthrie said it was that long ago, and Mr. Trump said: Wow, you mean youre going so low as to talk about something that took place 25 years ago about whether or not I made a phone call. I guess youre saying under a presumed name.The answer is no, he said, and lets get onto more current subjects, I mean, I know its wonderful for your listeners but I think we have more important things to discuss.Mr. Trump has acknowledged in the past calling reporters under the name John Barron, a practice he described at the time as a joke gone awry."}
{"text": "Thieves have again found their way into what was thought to be the most secure financial messaging system in the world and stolen money from a bank. The crime appears to be part of a broad online attack on global banking.New details about a second attack involving Swift  the messaging system used by thousands of banks and companies to move money around the world  are emerging as investigators are still trying to solve the $81 million heist from the central bank of Bangladesh in February. In that theft, the attackers were able to compel the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money to accounts in the Philippines.The second attack involves a commercial bank, which Swift declined to identify. But in a letter Swift plans to share with its users on Friday, the messaging network warned that the two attacks bore numerous similarities and were very likely part of a wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.The unusual warning from Swift, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, shows how serious the financial industry regards these attacks to be. Some banking experts say they may be impossible to solve or trace. Swift said the thieves somehow got their hands on legitimate network credentials, initiated the fraudulent transfers and installed malware on bank computers to disguise their movements.The attackers clearly exhibit a deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operation controls within the targeted banks  knowledge that may have been gained from malicious insiders or cyberattacks, or a combination of both, Swift said in its warning, which is expected to be posted on a secure part of its website on Friday.Security experts who have studied the attacks said the thieves may have been lurking inside the bank systems for months before they were detected.In its warning, Swift pointed to another worrying situation: that the thieves may have been able to recruit bank employees to hand over credentials and other key details.In both cases, the core messaging system of Swift was not breached; rather, the criminals attacked the banks connections to the Swift network. Each bank is responsible for maintaining the security of its connection to Swift. Criminals have found ways to exploit loopholes in bank security to obtain login credentials and dispatch fraudulent Swift messages.As a matter of urgency, we remind all customers again to urgently review controls in their payments environments, Swift tells its customers in the letter to be posted on Friday.Banks  like many major corporations  are constantly under attack by criminals, seeking to find the weak point in their defenses. An attack in the summer of 2014 on JPMorgan Chase compromised the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, but no money was stolen. Thieves frequently steal bank customers A.T.M. and credit card credentials.But these attacks involving Swift stand out, because millions of dollars were stolen  not from a large number of customers, but from the banks themselves. It is as if the thieves used their hacking skills to reach inside a bank vault.Emboldened and enriched, the thieves are likely to strike again, security experts predict.An event like this changes the risk profile for the banking system, since the attackers will inevitably reinvest some of their profits in new large-scale attacks, said Paul Kocher, a security and encryption expert who is the president of Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.Initially, many banks and security experts dismissed the Bangladesh attacks as brazen, but probably isolated, events in a developing country. A stream of news reports from the capital of Dhaka cited rudimentary technology at Bangladesh Bank, like a $10 router and an absence of firewalls. Bangladesh officials had blamed the New York Fed, saying it failed to block the fraudulent transfers.On Tuesday, representatives from Swift, the New York Fed and Bangladesh Bank met in Basel, Switzerland, to discuss the breach and the vulnerabilities it exposed in the system.In a joint statement, the three sides said they had agreed to cooperate in trying to bring the perpetrators to justice, and protect the global financial system from these types of attacks.But the details of the second attack  which Swift said occurred in the last few months  suggested a highly sophisticated threat that did not necessarily hinge on weak digital defenses. Swift declined to say how much money was stolen from the bank, which was not located in Bangladesh.Somehow the thieves obtained a valid Swift credential that allowed them to create, approve and submit messages on the network. Those messages  sent from PCs in the banks back offices or from laptops  were then used to move money from one of the banks accounts.Many banks have a system of checks and balances by which they can validate and review transactions to root out fraud.But in this latest case, the thieves used a form of malware that targeted a PDF reader that the bank used to confirm that payments had been made. The malware, according to Swift, then manipulated the PDF to remove traces of the fraudulent instructions.That the thieves knew that the bank used a PDF program to confirm its payments shows the level of detail gleaned about how the particular system worked. At Bangladesh Bank, Swift transactions were tracked using physical printouts. So the thieves tailored their malware in that attack to interfere with the printer and cover their tracks.The attacks have been a major headache for the ubiquitous and publicity-shy Swift, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Based in Belgium, Swift is partly owned and overseen by the worlds biggest banks, which have used the technology to facilitate money transfers since the 1970s. It prides itself on not disclosing any information about its users.After the attacks, Swift has had to walk a fine line of emphasizing the fundamental soundness of its network while urging its 11,000 users to take the utmost security measures to defend against future attack.Your first priority should be to ensure that you have all the preventative and detective measures in place to secure your own environment, Swift said in its message. This latest evidence adds further urgency to your work."}
{"text": "BEIJING  The news made global headlines on Wednesday: Queen Elizabeth II of England had remarked at a Buckingham Palace garden party the previous day that Chinese officials accompanying President Xi Jinping on a state visit had been very rude.An officially released video of the comment, made in conversation with a Metropolitan police commander, Lucy DOrsi, circulated widely online. Ms. DOrsi had managed security during Mr. Xis visit in October. At the party, the queen, widely considered a paragon of decorum, was expressing sympathy with Ms. DOrsi over difficulties the policewoman had experienced, saying it was bad luck that she had had to deal with the officials.Ms. DOrsi said that Chinese officials at one point stormed out of a meeting in London with her and Barbara Woodward, the British ambassador to China, and threatened to cancel Mr. Xis visit.The queens words resonated online. Among hundreds of comments on The New York Times article, one reader from Michigan wrote: Hats off to the queen for telling it like it is. The Chinese government is a rude bully, as it demonstrates repeatedly by its actions around the world.A reader from New Hampshire asked: Wasnt the imposition of opium on the Chinese by the British just a bit rude also?And then there were these words from a reader in upstate New York: Rude? Walking around with a crown and a pedigree is an affront to the human race. Monarchs are ridiculous, when stripped of the thugs who keep them in power.Global Times, a state-run newspaper with a strong streak of nationalism, published an editorial on Thursday that said ties between the two nations would not be affected by the queens remarks. It also criticized British journalists for reporting on the comments.The disrespectful gossipers in the media there, narcissistic and baring their fangs, seemingly retain vestiges of the inelegance of barbarians, it said. We believe, however, that with constant contact with the 5,000-year-old civilization of the East, they will make progress.On Wednesday afternoon, Western journalists in Beijing pressed a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lu Kang, about the comments by the queen. The questions took up half a regularly scheduled news conference. By the end, Mr. Lu had grown weary of the barrage, as the transcript below shows.The Foreign Ministry usually censors questions on delicate matters from its transcripts of the briefings. And some officials certainly considered the queens remarks objectionable  a televised BBC report about the exchange was blacked out in China on Wednesday. Yet, in its transcript of the Wednesday session, the ministry retained nearly all the questions about the comments, with minor changes to the wording of a few queries.There was one exception. A question from Felicia Sonmez of The Wall Street Journal and Mr. Lus answer were excised entirely. She asked, Does China think that the video of the queens comments was released on purpose?Mr. Lu replied, I think you should refer your question to those who put the footage on the website.Four of the questions about the remarks came from Tom Phillips of The Guardian, who appeared eager to pin down whether relations between Britain and China were still in a golden era, as leaders of both countries have asserted for months.The third question in the news conference was the first to tackle the queens comments, after queries about Afghanistan and the United States Navy. The following questions and answers are from the official English-language transcript.Q. The British side said yesterday that Chinese officials were very rude to the U.K. ambassador to China during President Xi Jinpings visit to the U.K. last year. What is your response?A. President Xi Jinpings state visit to the U.K. last October was a great success, thanks to the enormous efforts made by teams of the two sides. Both China and the U.K. highly recognized that.Q. Follow-up: Are you concerned that what the U.K. said will affect the bilateral relations?A. China and the U.K. agree that President Xi Jinpings state visit to the U.K. last October was a great success, and that the two sides made arduous efforts to make it happen. President Xi Jinpings state visit to the U.K. last October ushered in a golden era for the bilateral relations. This is also echoed by the British side.[The next two questions addressed Taiwan and the Philippines.]Q. Has the golden era advocated by President Xi Jinping and U.K. Prime Minister Cameron already started? If so, when exactly did it start?A. I think I have already made it clear when saying that President Xi Jinpings state visit to the U.K. last October ushered in a golden era for the bilateral relations.[Then came three questions: on Chinas One Belt, One Road economic development plan, on a coming China-United States diplomatic meeting and President Obamas planned trip to Hiroshima.]Q. Can you confirm that the China-U.K. relationship is still in the golden era?A. I have said that the successful state visit by President Xi Jinping ushered in a golden era for the bilateral relations. The two sides are now working together to implement various agreements reached during the state visit.[Then came questions on Morocco and the issue of sovereign immunity for Chinese state-owned enterprises. The question afterward, from Ms. Sonmez of The Journal, about the queen, was redacted from the official transcript. The next questions on the queens remarks, from Mr. Phillips of The Guardian, remained in the transcript.]Q. Chinese ambassador to the U.K. Liu Xiaoming wrote an article for The Times five days ago, criticizing the U.S. and the U.K. for meddling in the South China Sea issue. To what extent will the U.K.s comments affect relations with China?A. There is no need for me to repeat our position on the South China Sea issue. I am sure that you are very clear about that. It is hoped that relevant parties, especially countries outside the region, if they really want to do something on this issue, would play a constructive role and help China and Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries resolve this issue following the dual-track approach, instead of the contrary.The dispute has been in existence for over four decades. But that did not get in the way of regional peace, stability and security as well as commercial navigation freedom before 2010 when the so-called Rebalance to Asia strategy was introduced. China and regional countries certainly hope that this region will stay as an important engine for the world economy and enjoy peace, stability and security. We hope that countries outside the region can respect that, as it will do themselves good in the long run.[Between the preceding question and the one below was a question about an arms race in space.]Q. Are you surprised at what the British side said?A. I have already said what I can say. What about you spell out what is still on your mind."}
{"text": "A group of Bernie Sanders supporters who have worked or volunteered for his campaign have come up with a draft proposal calling for the Vermont senator to suspend his presidential bid after the June 7 California primary, eventually concede to Hillary Clinton and build an independent organization aimed at defeating Donald J. Trump.The three-page document addresses a question now facing Mr. Sanderss most ardent supporters: how to harness the energy of a movement now that his presidential bid appears to be bowing to the reality that Mrs. Clinton will capture the Democratic nomination. The document suggests building an organization, completely independent of the Clinton campaign, to defeat Mr. Trump before focusing on other goals after the November election.About a dozen current and former Sanders staff members and volunteers have been collaborating on the draft proposal, which was obtained by The New York Times and first reported by Politico.While the authors believe Mr. Sanders will win the California primary, they write that barring a miracle, he will not become the partys nominee. Two of the authors, who are former campaign staff members, confirmed the authenticity of the document. The authors all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were working without the campaigns authorization.The draft lays out a scenario for Mr. Sanderss leaving the race. Senator Sanders may graciously concede and enthusiastically endorse Hillary Clintons bid to defeat the threatened right-wing takeover of our country by Donald Trump at this time, or may withhold that final step in anticipation of discussions with the Clinton camp before the convention, the draft says.Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, called the draft plan totally irrelevant.We are focused on winning the Democratic nomination, Mr. Briggs said in an email. This document is something that neither the senator nor anyone he works with has seen. We have no idea who wrote it. We could care less about the document.He added that Mr. Sanders expects to win more delegates in the weeks ahead and that he is campaigning to win the nomination.However, the authors argue that Mr. Sanders should pivot away from trying to win the nomination after California votes. He should build an organization to facilitate the growing voice of a new generation of activists to focus initially on defeating Mr. Trump in November.Such an organization would be devoted to mobilizing voters to defend our democracy in November 2016 and beyond, the authors of the plan write.The draft says Mr. Sanders can help bring together young, newly political Sanders supporters who see rejection of Hillary and the Democratic Party establishment as core to their identity. They suggest that his supporters should work to influence the partys platform at the Democratic National Convention this July in Philadelphia, and that Mr. Sanders should host his own convention on transforming American politics, separate from the partys gathering.Coming out of their own convention, the goal will be to launch the best organized independent expenditure organization in history and give the vast (and deeply anti-establishment) base a vehicle into which they will wholeheartedly pour their energy, the draft said.The proposal included a section about the challenges of building an independent organization, chief among them fund-raising. They write that Mr. Sanders will have to decide whether such a group would take money from wealthier progressives and even suggests the possibility of creating a panel of volunteers who would decide whether to take large donations.The group says Mr. Sanders is in a similar position as Senator Barack Obama after he energized millions of supporters during his 2008 presidential campaign. However, the authors say Mr. Obama failed to capitalize on the opportunity to change the power structure in America.Does Bernie Sanders and his campaign facilitate the growing voice of a new generation of activists who can rack up the defeat of Donald Trump as their first major achievement? the draft asks. Or does he raise hell at a party convention and leave the remains of his organization to be picked over by the existing groups on the left that, to date, have been mostly marginal to the broad majority of Americans and Sanders supporters alike?The authors say, Bernie Sanders will have to decide these priorities."}
{"text": "Listeners filled Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening when Yannick Nzet-Sguin  the Canadian maestro who seems to be a prime candidate for the Metropolitan Operas next music director  and the Philadelphia Orchestra opened their concert with Rachmaninoffs First Piano Concerto, with Lang Lang as the soloist. Somewhat fewer remained after intermission for Mahlers sprawling Tenth Symphony, as completed by Deryck Cooke in the 1960s, and fewer still after the works 25-minute opening Adagio, the lone movement that Mahler had substantially completed before his death in 1911.Put it in the best light: Perhaps, like Leonard Bernstein, who consented to perform only the Adagio, the defectors were purists with little taste for conjecture of the type needed to fill out Mahlers waning sketches for the four remaining movements. But, naw, they undoubtedly ducked out because they just didnt want to hear 75 minutes of Mahler, real or imagined.In any case, the piano fans certainly got what they came for. Mr. Lang was his spectacular self, producing controlled thunder in bravura moments, melting lyricism in contrast and everything between.He was also his annoying self, mugging, gesticulating and swooning throughout. Still, the performance was so fine that you were almost ready to declare a truce and simply let Lang Lang be Lang Lang. Then he played a lovely little solo encore, Dance of Coral, by Du Mingxin, with no gazing at the audience or the ceiling.What will it take to make Mr. Lang understand that the music  and he, through it  can communicate much more strongly and directly without all the superficialities? Then again, he can fill Carnegie, and you and I cant.As for the Mahler, Cookes completion of the sketches for the symphony makes for a plausible work of art, complete in its meanderings and symmetries and satisfying in its conclusion. But is it really Mahler?That is up to the individual listener. The problem for me is not that anything sounds particularly unlike Mahler but that much sounds too specifically Mahlerian, leading you into another symphony and down a blind alley. As a young symphonist, Mahler was fond of quoting himself and reusing material. In his later works, he was less so, though the technique is a ready option for an outsider wanting to ensure a Mahlerian sound.Rachmaninoff and Mahler meet somewhere at the juncture of late Romanticism and post-Romanticism, styles in which the Philadelphians excelled through the 20th century. Rachmaninoff had a close relationship with the ensemble, and it was the Philadelphia Orchestra that, under Eugene Ormandy, gave the American premiere and made the first recording of Cookes edition of Mahlers Tenth, in 1965.Mr. Nzet-Sguin drew on that history effectively in performances mingling sonorous brilliance with depth of sound, the orchestras strings, as always, providing a warm blanket."}

{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Bartolo Colon stood in the on-deck circle staring out at Clayton Kershaw, one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball, as Eric Campbell stood at the plate in one of many mismatches that took place on this cool evening at Chavez Ravine.In his previous game, Colon had homered for the first time in his 19-year career, and on Wednesday, Noah Syndergaard had reinforced the notion of Mets pitchers as dangerous hitters by whacking two home runs.But any chance that Colon would follow that up with another stunning display of batsmanship was highly unlikely against Kershaw, who was on his way to a brilliant three-hit, 13-strikeout shutout.Some of the best hitters in the world fail against Kershaw, let alone an endearing, rotund part-time bat swinger like Colon.After Campbell grounded out, Colon briefly dipped his head and walked to the plate for his turn against the three-time National League Cy Young Award winner. Predictably, it did not go as well as things had last Saturday in San Diego.Colon struck out looking on four pitches and walked back to the dugout to refocus on his real job, pitching. But that side of his work did not go very well, either.I wasnt expecting to take any swings, Colon said through an interpreter. The inning prior was a little long, so I was trying to get some rest.The Dodgers touched him for five runs in five innings, including a three-run homer by Yasmani Grandal and a solo shot by Chase Utley, villain of villains to Mets fans. Colon was removed for a pinch-hitter in the sixth, so he had only the one at-bat.Kershaw was at his best, dominating the Mets over nine nearly flawless innings as the Dodgers won, 5-0. It was Kershaws second shutout in his last three games. He also shut out the Padres on May 1 in a game the Dodgers won, 1-0.Kershaw (5-1) struck out 13 batters  including all three in the ninth  giving him five straight games with at least 10 strikeouts, a new Dodgers record. That is an impressive mark for a team that has featured some of the games top hurlers, like Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Orel Hershiser, Don Sutton, Fernando Valenzuela and Hideo Nomo.In his 250th career start, Kershaw improved to 7-0 in 10 starts against the Mets, with a 1.17 E.R.A., and he is 81-0 over all when he gets four or more runs in support.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts noted Kershaws fastball command and his slider depth, and his curveball was another potent weapon.We had the best pitcher on the planet going, Roberts said, adding, You give him the lead, he smells the finish line  he smells blood.Kershaw now has 14 shutouts, the most among active pitchers. Colon is second with 13.Over his previous three starts before Thursdays game, Kershaw had struck out 34 batters without issuing a single walk. It was the second time he had constructed such a streak, including one last year.The only other pitcher in the last 100 years to put together three straight games with at least 10 strikeouts and no walks was Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays, also last year.But in the first inning, Kershaw walked David Wright on a full-count fastball out of the zone. It was the first base on balls Kershaw had allowed since April 21.The first hit was somewhat cheap, a roller through the right side of the infield by Asdrubal Cabrera, who had two of the hits, leading off the fourth. Kershaw struck out Wright swinging and then got Yoenis Cespedes to ground into a double play to end the inning.Kershaw continued to handcuff the Mets, setting down the next five batters until Curtis Granderson doubled into the right-field corner with two outs in the sixth.It was only the second extra-base hit by a lefty that Kershaw had surrendered all season (49 at-bats). But Kershaw struck out Cabrera looking to end that threat.In the ninth, Kershaw struck out Lucas Duda, Granderson and Wright."}
{"text": "The title of Nathaniel Philbricks Valiant Ambition says everything about it, because it says nothing. Those two words are generic enough to have been used for almost any of his prizewinning historical books (In the Heart of the Sea and Mayflower), and it might even have worked for his book of criticism, Why Read Moby-Dick?His new books subtitle is just as boldly noncommittal: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, and the Fate of the American Revolution. Is that supposed to amplify something?A verb in the subtitle would have been nice, just to indicate how the Washington-Arnold connection had an impact on the revolution. But from the books outset, its clear that Mr. Philbrick did not approach this project with a clear thesis. He approached it with a mandate, a methodology, a book contract and a couple of big names to connect. At least thats how Valiant Ambition reads.The biggest surprise for any fan of Mr. Philbrick who picks up this book is that surprisingly little of it describes the interactions between Washington and Arnold. They werent that frequent: These two men have very little contact during the first half of this chronicle. Instead, we find ourselves in the midst of one of Mr. Philbricks meticulously researched historical pageants describing battle after battle in the Revolutionary War, maps and all. It should come as no surprise that this author sounds happiest when the action is afloat; he brings some of his most enthusiastic writing to the 1776-77 naval fighting, led on the American side by Brig. Gen. Benedict Arnold, up and down Lake Champlain.Because the author has already written about the American Revolution in Bunker Hill, this new book begins further south, centered mostly in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. One of its aims is to contrast Washingtons more thoughtful, measured character with Arnolds vain, hotheaded one, and each man is best defined by his strategic decisions and behavior in battle.Mr. Philbrick captures a good sense of Washingtons warring instincts  for moderation and aggression, for defense and attack  and his constant struggle to keep them in check. But the author is on heavily trampled territory, as this books exhaustive bibliography makes clear. So the Philbrickian research style comes into play: He is a relentless digger, and he will unearth unusual material just because of its novelty, regardless of its importance. If a diarist witnessed a battle from afar, but observed a beautiful cloud of smoke rising about the fray, Mr. Philbrick would note the description, even if it doesnt signify much. His loquacious page notes make his unearthing of this material sound almost as adventurous as the war stories in the book.By streamlining his portrait of Washington, Mr. Philbrick creates a sense of genuine leadership, the kind developed through constant soul-searching about the wisdom of decisions made. It doesnt take much to illustrate how Arnold impressed Washington even though he hadnt one whit of that same decency. The Arnold in this book was a brave, stellar commander. But he is not fully seen until late, when he had become disgruntled, disappointed, demoted, maimed, bitter, mercenary and full of grudges.Despite Washingtons lingering confidence in him, Arnold displayed showy, reckless behavior that compromised his ability to command his men. He engaged in shady business practices and lied about his finances in order to marry well. He faced a court-martial. Even after that led to a reprimand, Washington sent him an eloquent but sadly misguided letter telling him to change his ways. I reprimand you for having forgotten that, in proportion as you have rendered yourself formidable to our enemies; you should have been guarded and temperate in your deportment towards your fellow citizens, Washington said. These are among the most personal words to pass between them in Mr. Philbricks whole, not terribly intimate, book.Liveliness is one of this authors usual strengths. And you might expect many moods for a book about war, loyalty, trust betrayed and the buildup to treason. But Valiant Ambition is atypically dry, with a lot of it devoted to troop movements and all those maps. The Revolutionary War aficionados best suited to appreciating fine points about the Siege of Fort Stanwix may know enough about it already.Action is more apt to reveal character in Mr. Philbricks other books than it does here, and Arnold wasnt much of a talker. He complained well. He bragged a lot and let it be known that his second wife, the former Peggy Shippen, was good in bed; he also sent Peggy the same love letter he had once sent to another romantic prospect. But the book has relatively little of his language to speak for him.What Valiant Ambition does have working in its favor is intrinsic interest. A strong, insightful book about Arnolds betrayal of his country might not only have historical value but also resonance for us today. Unfortunately, this one has so few far-reaching ramifications that both Mr. Philbrick and the jacket copy writer have thrown in allusions to Shakespeare as a means of elevating it. In this context, Shakespearean tragedy doesnt mean all it ought to. It just means sad."}
{"text": "SATURDAY PUZZLE  Lets talk about seed entries today.Have you ever wondered how crossword puzzle constructors decide which entries to put in a grid, and where they start? In a themed puzzle, the development and placement of a theme come first; but later in the week, constructors rely on unique and lively entries to anchor or seed their puzzles.In todays puzzle by Jeff Chen, the central entry is a device called a SAWZALL and, if you read his notes below, its clearly a form of therapy for Mr. Chen that he is using it as his seed entry. I can understand that; he might have lost his friend Shawn had Mr. Chen not explained about load-bearing walls. So into a puzzle it goes, and now Mr. Chen can put that unfortunate incident behind him.I happen to like pinwheel-shaped grids, because you can focus on a sector without feeling too boxed in, and Mr. Chen does a nice job of keeping the channels between the sectors open. Not only that, but the grid is clean (no junky fill or crosswordese) and the fill is lively, so this one was a pleasure to solve. Id be hard-pressed to pick out favorites in a puzzle like this one, but I especially liked SNO CONES, LOCAVORE, SHINOLA, BEE VENOM, MR. PEANUT, I PROMISE, JAZZ AGE, LOAN WORD and MALL MAP. Hands up if you are a fluent speaker of Nahuatl. Dont laugh, its entirely possible, especially if you hail from central Mexico. Even if you dont speak Nahuatl, you can still get to the answer for 3D. I had a few of the crossings, and since I knew we were talking about big cats from the clue (Its name comes from Nahuatl for jaguar'), I was able to take an educated guess and write in OCELOT. Whats old can be new again in crosswords, like in todays 14A. When you see words like now in a clue, youre being asked to think of an older word that has been replaced by a newer word, in this case, yours. So the clue Whats now yours doesnt mean youve been given something (sorry!), it means you need to think of an older word for yours. Today, the answer is THINE. Ah, the English language. How many homographs (words that are spelled the same but are pronounced differently) are there? In todays puzzle, we have one at 9D (Polish giant, once) that fooled me for a while. I read it as having a long O, as if the giant was from Poland. It turns out that today its about polish with a short O, as in something you use to put a shine on things. And the answer is the brand SHINOLA.Lets hear Mr. Chen out:About 15 years ago, a buddy of mine bought a house. As an industrial designer, he had grand visions of rebuilding the fixer-upper into an avant-garde mansion appropriate for his aesthetic sensibilities.Walls got sledgehammered, windows smashed and he wielded a SAWZALL at anything that looked at him funny. When we asked him if one column (which he had already sawed halfway through) was load-bearing, he stopped and asked:What does load-bearing mean?Thankfully, Shawn is still alive.And that, my friends, pretty much ensures that you will never forget the word SAWZALL.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "Family dynamics matter more than festering undead in What We Become, a Danish horror movie that, like the first season of Fear the Walking Dead, examines the rapid disruption of social order when a mysterious virus threatens an affluent suburb.That preference for lingering on inchoate terrors over visible monsters, though, creates an extended tease that will frustrate genre expectations and make this modest, elegant little movie a tough sell to zombie-saturated audiences. Yet the writer and director, Bo Mikkelsen, has spent his money wisely, building a believably imperfect family of four around the strong actress Mille Dinesen, who plays the increasingly distraught mother, Pernille, with velvety control.Muting the usual cacophony of manipulative musical cues and assaultive sound effects  for long stretches, the movie is almost hushed  Mr. Mikkelsen stirs claustrophobia into panic. Apocalyptic news flashes add background static as the family huddles around home movies and listens to squads of gas-masked soldiers tramping the leafy streets. Basic services and freedoms evaporate, and forays outside become perilous; but instead of embracing the easy menace of darkness and shadow, the director and his cinematographer, Adam Philp, make the more challenging choice to stage key sequences in full sunlight.As a result, What We Become is a very pretty movie with a very dark heart. The payoff is brutal, but earned; the harshness of its kindness-cant-pay message perfectly aligned with a situation in which trusting your neighbors can literally come back to bite you in the neck."}
{"text": "Robert Laing, a handsome doctor with tired eyes and a skeptical smirk  which is to say a doctor played by Tom Hiddleston  remarks at one point that he feels as if hes living in a future that has already taken place. That pretty much sums up what its like to watch High-Rise, Ben Wheatleys reverent adaptation of the J. G. Ballard novel of the same title.Ballard, who died in 2009, was a brilliant prose stylist and science-fiction satirist who is perhaps a bit overrated by his admirers as a social critic and a prophet. High-Rise, published in 1975, is very much a product of its moment, and its vision of apocalyptic decadence has long since taken on a nostalgic coloration. He was a master of blending horror and titillation, and the books orgies of sex, drugs and ironic banter are appealing as well as appalling.The same is true of Mr. Wheatleys film, though it is also kind of boring. The retro-futurist production design is gorgeously awful, the cast is awfully gorgeous, and the dystopian setting is explored with an appropriately Ballardian blend of suavity and aggression. But onscreen, High-Rise is curiously inert. The themes dont resonate, and the story lags and lumbers.A single man haunted by the memory of his dead sister, Laing moves into a futuristic skyscraper designed by a mysterious, idealistic architect. Eventually, the two men meet (the architect is played by Jeremy Irons, who could be Mr. Hiddlestons Dorian Gray hologram). The building, part of a projected complex, was meant to be an incubator for social change, but it has devolved into a paranoid, class-ridden microcosm of social dysfunction. Amid suggestions of a larger societal collapse, the one-percenters on the upper floors are snobbish brutes inclined toward drunkenness and debauchery. The middle classes down below are into the same stuff, but with cheaper booze in more crowded apartments.Laing pursues an affair with one neighbor (Sienna Miller) and develops an affectionate regard for another (Elisabeth Moss). Both women are connected to a loutish documentary filmmaker (Luke Evans) who becomes Laings buddy and his rival. The tower devolves into anarchy, a Hobbesian state foretold in the opening scene, in which Laing cooks and eats a dog.That moment evokes the unforgettable first sentence of Ballards book, but though the film persistently tries to replicate his chilly, insightful wit  mostly through Laings voice-over narration and occasional lines of straight-from-the-page dialogue  it serves more as a tribute to his sensibility than a successful translation.High-Rise is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Old-fashioned end-of-the world sex, drugs and mayhem. Running time:  1 hour 59 minutes."}

{"text": "IN 1857, Roger B. Taney, chief justice of the United States, wrote that Dred Scott, an enslaved man living in Missouri, had no standing to sue for freedom, on the grounds that blacks could not be citizens. They were, he declared, so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.That ruling fanned the flames of the Civil War and is widely reviled today as the worst legal decision in American history. But this weekend, the Taney and Scott legacies will be brought together less contentiously when Lynne M. Jackson, a great-great-granddaughter of Scott, and Charles Taney, a great-great-grandnephew of Taney, meet onstage at the Actors Studio in Manhattan for a conversation about race, reconciliation and their famous forebears.The occasion is a performance of A Man of His Time, a one-act play by Kate Taney Billingsley, Charles Taneys daughter, about a fictional meeting between a Taney descendant and a Scott descendant in a diner on the New Jersey Turnpike on March 6, 2016, 159 years to the day after the ruling was issued.For Ms. Billingsley, 31, a member of the Actors Studio, the play grew out of years of wrestling with her complicated family inheritance. When she was growing up in Greenwich, Conn., her father, an advertising executive, instilled both a pride in Roger B. Taneys accomplishments  he was the second-longest-serving chief justice in history  and an awareness of his shameful role in the Scott case.I always grew up feeling a little bit embarrassed about the Taney name, she said. When we came to the page in my school textbook about Dred Scott, I would cringe. (Billingsley is her married name.)There had long been debate in the family, she said, about whether to draft an apology to the Scotts. Nothing came of it, but in the play the fictional Taney offers an apology, which does not go well.Its like he brought a Band-Aid to an amputation, she said. In doing it, he realizes that its an empty gesture in some ways.Ms. Jackson, a former law firm manager from outside St. Louis and the founder of the Dred Scott Heritage Foundation, has collaborated with descendants of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and of Peter Blow, Dred Scotts first owner. Before Ms. Billingsley contacted her last month, Ms. Jackson had never been in touch with any Taneys.While the apology in the play may be awkward, Ms. Jackson said she gave the fictional Taney credit for taking the risk of starting a conversation.A lot of people think just saying Im sorry is enough, but I think Taney in the play has it in his heart to try to start a relationship, she said.She added: I think apologies sometimes have to be received as well. That starts the dialogue."}
{"text": "In Jeff and Michael Zimbalists footballer biopic, Pel: Birth of a Legend, we are endlessly told of the importance of what is known in Portuguese as ginga: a distinctly Brazilian swing and style of play. Ginga notwithstanding, this celebration of a soccer superstars rise from poverty to national treasure is more a familiar tale for fans to nod along with than a sports drama with a real kick.As a child, Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Leonardo Lima Carvalho) kicks the ball around with fellow ragtag underdogs wearing homemade uniforms. Rich kids taunt him and nickname him Pel, a moniker he comes to embrace. His father (played by the singer Seu Jorge), a soccer phenom himself and later a janitor, schools him in the beautiful game, at one point using mangoes in lieu of balls.Pels childhood is marred by a double heartbreak: a pals death and Brazils 1950 loss in the World Cup. Yet at 16, he snags a place on Brazils national team for the 1958 World Cup. Vincent DOnofrio luxuriates in a Portuguese accent as the coach of the national team, who is initially disdainful of what he calls the primitive ginga style but then exhorts Pel (now played by Kevin de Paula Rosa) and his teammates to be themselves.The films director of photography, Matthew Libatique, makes Pel more than an eye-moistening anthem for a built-in global audience. Working around the screenplays childlike writing, this dynamic cinematographer (known for his work with Spike Lee and Darren Aronofsky) hustles to turn the sensation of movement into the films driving force. He comes closer to evoking ginga than any of the gushy dialogue or soundtrack cues.Pel: Birth of a Legend is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for the love of the game and the fiery tempers it inspires."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Detainees at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, could plead guilty to criminal charges in civilian court via video teleconference under a provision being considered by the Senate that could open a new avenue to whittling down the prisons remaining population.The Senate Armed Services Committee announced late Thursday that it had included the provision in the annual National Defense Authorization Act. The bill, which now goes to the full Senate, would also authorize detainees who pleaded guilty through video teleconference to be transferred to other countries to serve their sentences.The legislation would largely extend an existing ban on bringing detainees to the United States. Mr. Obama had asked Congress to lift that ban; his plan for closing the prison is to bring a small number of detainees who cannot be transferred to a replacement wartime prison on domestic soil.However, the bill would allow the temporary transfer of detainees to the United States for emergency medical treatment, the committee said. The base in Cuba has only limited medical equipment and capabilities.The committee has not yet released the text of the bill. But it issued a summary after finishing a closed-door session on Thursday to make revisions.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the committee, said he supported an all-of-the-above approach that would give the government a criminal disposition path for rank-and-file detainees  especially if it did not involve bringing them to a courthouse on domestic soil, something he said could make the courthouse a target. Still, Mr. Graham emphasized that he thought it made more sense to use military commissions for contested trials of high-value terrorists.Late last year, several lawyers who represent detainees sent a letter to the Justice Department expressing interest in exploring plea deals by video teleconference  but only in civilian court, not military commissions.Allowing a detainee to plead guilty and cooperate with the U.S. government is a no-brainer, said Wells Dixon, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents many detainees. This provision should draw broad bipartisan support. It is an important step toward cleaning up the mess that exists at Guantnamo, and reducing the so-called irreducible minimum who remain in limbo.Civilian court offers several advantages for detainees seeking a defined sentence and an exit from the wartime prison.Detainees who participated in a terrorist group but were not linked to any specific attack could plead guilty to several offenses under domestic criminal law, including conspiracy and providing material support to terrorism. A federal appeals court has ruled that those offenses are not available in a military commission because they are not war crimes.In addition, civilian courts, unlike commissions, can count previous time in custody toward any sentence. Most of the detainees have been locked up for about 14 years without trial.The detainees lawyers had argued that federal rules could be interpreted as permitting guilty pleas by remote video link. But Justice Department officials concluded that the rules did not permit people to plead guilty to a felony while not physically present in court, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Several weeks ago, the Obama administration sent to Congress several proposals about detainee issues to consider including in the National Defense Authorization Act, including steps to make military commissions, which have been plagued with problems, more efficient. (The committees announcement did not say whether it had approved that request.)Officials said that the administration had also considered asking Congress to permit remote guilty pleas but decided not to after the Justice Department raised an additional concern: whether a judge would accept a guilty plea as voluntary when the alternative was continued indefinite detention, rather than a trial.Eighty detainees remain at Guantnamo. Of them, 10 have been charged or convicted in the military commissions system, 44 have been neither charged nor recommended for transfer, and 26 have been recommended for transfer.The administrations interagency process approved transfer deals for 14 of the 26 on that list several weeks ago, officials said, although Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has not yet notified Congress that he approved them. The statutory transfer restrictions require that he do so at least 30 days before any detainee leaves.Lee Wolosky, the State Department envoy who negotiates transfers, said: While we are unable to comment on specific transfers, we remain pleased that our allies and partners continue to provide assistance as we work to reduce the detainee population through foreign transfers, one of the main pillars of the plan to close the detention facility at Guantnamo."}
{"text": "The titans of tech dont talk about it, but entrepreneurial Silicon Valley was built on government spending, in particular Defense Department funding for things like radar, semiconductors and what became the Internet. Everybody was happy about that.Now maybe the Valley is returning the favor, building out the future of defense. The happiness of this has yet to be determined.As John Markoff writes, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter just paid his fourth visit to the Valley. Fittingly, he spoke near Googles headquarters, and talked about the importance of putting artificial intelligence, or A.I., in our nations weapons.He was speaking at something called the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility, which was started a year ago in Mountain View, Calif. Technology leaders used to come to Washington, but now Washington comes to them, too.It was, as one of the Valleys more cynical turns of phrase has it, a buzzword-compliant talk. Besides A.I., Mr. Carter talked about how the new facility was iterating rapidly, which means trying a lot of different stuff fast, visiting innovation hubs, and even thinking outside our five-sided box, presumably a reference to the Pentagon, though with floor and ceiling, that box has seven sides.Talking the local talk will likely do little to soothe the many critics, inside and outside tech, who worry about outsourcing wars to machines. Autopilots on airplanes are one thing, but if computers start optimizing for lethality, it may be difficult to limit conflicts.Equally, there are concerns about what other large powers are doing in robotics and A.I. The United States leads the world in A.I., and drawing from Valley companies may be a way to keep an edge. Yet even there, a face-off between two A.I.-powered adversaries could mean an unforeseen escalation or other type of complication that could overwhelm the humans charged with monitoring.The moral dimensions and unintended consequences of pilot stress seen with Americas drone program may be but a foretaste of what well face with A.I. violenceExpect to see a lot more of the Pentagon in the Valley, and in other parts of tech as well. On Tuesday, Air Force Maj. Gen. Sarah Zabel, the vice director of the Defense Information Systems Agency, gave a one-hour talk to a computer networking group on the security and communications needs of her 4.5 million-user communications system.She was worried about hackers, another whole new kind of adversary, in a world turned upside-down by tech."}
{"text": "CHICAGO  The Chicago Cubs dress, eat, train and party in a subterranean fortress of attitude. The old home clubhouse at Wrigley Field never hosted a championship celebration. Within the new complex  20 feet below ground and more than twice the size of its predecessor  is a room devoted to joy, apart from the locker room, where players congregate to bask in their victories.It exists, oh yeah, Manager Joe Maddon said, though he would not disclose many details. Well, really, thats sensitive and classified information, what we do in there. But its a fun thing. It includes laser lights and disco balls. Ill give that much.Welcome to the bold new era of baseballs best team, which does not care that it is also the most historically tortured. The Cubs, as their T-shirts say, embrace the target.They won 97 games last season and vanquished the rival St. Louis Cardinals in the National League playoffs. Losing the league championship series to the Mets was almost immaterial. The Cubs made tangible progress toward their first World Series title since 1908.This season will be defined by their performance in the fall. In the meantime, the Cubs are turning the regular season into its own compelling theater. While they wait for their next chance at glory, they might just be the games next superteam.At 25-8, the Cubs are off to their best start since 1907, a year that ended with a championship. The last team before the Cubs to go so deep into a season without consecutive defeats was the 1929 Philadelphia Athletics, another World Series winner.Its strange, because we hadnt done it this year  and thats a great thing, second baseman Ben Zobrist said after the Cubs dropped a doubleheader to San Diego on Wednesday. Here we are in May, and its the first time weve lost two in a row. It speaks volumes to how weve played so far.The Cubs hitters are on pace to set a major league record for walks. Their starters have gone at least five innings in every game this season. The team has scored more than twice as many runs as its opponents. The Cubs are making history, and it surrounds them.Its hard not to see it, because its on all these TVs, third baseman Kris Bryant said, pointing to one of the nine huge flat screens visible from every part of the circular dressing room.Its been blown out a little more than wed want it to  the whole run-differential thing seems to be big  but we dont pay attention to it. We know we have a good record so far, but our mind-set is just to continue our hot start and hopefully separate ourselves early on. Thats kind of what Joe preached at the end of spring training: Get off to a good start, because its a lot harder to climb back uphill.The Cubs are building a mountain of victories. The major league record for wins in a season is 116, shared by the 1906 Cubs, who did it in 155 games (there were three ties), and the 2001 Seattle Mariners, who did it in 162. To break it, these Cubs would have to go 92-37, a .713 winning percentage that would be just slightly below their current mark.It seems far-fetched, and the Cubs already lost some of their depth last month with the season-ending knee injury to left fielder Kyle Schwarber. But the Golden State Warriors just set the wins record for the N.B.A. regular season. Sports fans can dream.I am not going to answer any question that mentions the Chicago Cubs and the Golden State Warriors, said Theo Epstein, the Cubs president of baseball operations. Seriously, its absurd. Weve had a good month. They just set the all-time wins record, and theyre working on back-to-back championships. We havent won in 108 years.Epstein built two World Series winners with the Boston Red Sox but is too smart to forecast a title this fall for the Cubs. Considering the nature of the sports, a fan of the best basketball team should be more optimistic than the fan of the best baseball team.If you do have the most talented basketball team  a dominant collection of talent  you can just about pencil them in for a No. 1 or No. 2 seed and, barring something silly, theyre going to show up in the finals with a chance to win, Epstein said. In baseball  in this era and with this playoff format  it just doesnt work that way. In basketball, you can maybe push your chances to like 65 percent of winning a championship. In baseball, maybe you can push yours to 20 percent. Its a totally different exercise.Yet optimism reigns at Wrigley, making this a rare moment for a team best known for heartbreak. This version of the Cubs  Epstein and Maddon, Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester  has not let anyone down. It is still full of promise, a blend of productive imports and rising young stars. The stands seem full of hope, not dread.Probably because thats how we feel, Maddon said. We dont have a fatalistic method about us whatsoever. I dont think our jobs are impacted or affected by the history of the Cubs in any way, shape or form  other than the fact that its a great tradition.The Cubs honor that tradition in the hallway leading to their dressing room. A giant photo near the door is a close-up of Ernie Banks and Ron Santo, youthful and vibrant, during Hall of Fame careers that never included a trip to the World Series. Next to that is a replica of the white W flag that flies from the scoreboard after wins.Zobrist wears W socks after every victory. No matter how many times he does, though, the Cubs can assure themselves of only so much. The 2001 Mariners did not even reach the World Series, falling to the Yankees in the second round of the American League playoffs.Jamie Moyer, a former Cub who won 20 games for those Mariners, said the team was never motivated by gaudy win totals.We were enamored by ourselves, by the way we were playing, Moyer said by phone Wednesday. We worked hard and played hard, but respected that, hey, theres a chance this isnt going to last, so lets enjoy it and appreciate it while its here.The 1998 Yankees, who won 114 games on their way to a championship, did chase a memorable record, said David Cone, who earned 20 of the wins. But it took a late-season meeting to refocus the team.Once we hit the 100-win mark early enough, we started to think: We could probably add on here, Cone said. But its easy to drift when you have that big of a lead.The Cubs lead the Pittsburgh Pirates, who visit Wrigley this weekend, by seven games in the N.L. Central Division, and the fallback of wild-card spots makes their postseason lead much bigger. But even a team that starts hot, like the vaunted 1984 Detroit Tigers, can go cold. After a 35-5 beginning to their season, the Tigers let their division lead dwindle to three and a half games by early June.They recovered, storming through the summer, going 104-58 and winning the World Series with a self-assurance that still resonates.With the 84 Tigers, when you walked out, you knew what the outcome was going to be, and you were going to win, said the Kansas City first-base coach Rusty Kuntz, a reserve who drove in the go-ahead run of the Tigers World Series clincher. It wasnt a cockiness; it wasnt a swag; it was just a confidence that the bottom line was, Were going to win, and the secondary question was: Whos going to do it? Depth is also a hallmark of the Cubs, who used theirs after Schwarber went down. They had re-signed another outfielder, Dexter Fowler, during spring training, and now Fowler has a .458 on-base percentage. Infielders Tommy La Stella and Javier Baez have been productive in semiregular roles, with Bryant often starting in the outfield.The Cubs rotation is less equipped to handle an injury, but for now the starters have a 2.29 E.R.A. Arrieta has allowed three earned runs or fewer in his last 27 regular-season starts, the longest streak since 1893  the year the pitching rubber was moved to 60 feet 6 inches from home plate.Arrieta said he spends no time reflecting on the majesty of those feats, or his numbers in those 27 starts: a 22-1 record, a 0.92 E.R.A., two no-hitters. Like his team, he is essentially breaking the game. But it is all just an entertaining sideshow.Its nice; all that stuffs great, Arrieta said. It would be even nicer if weve got a ring on our finger at the end of the season.The Cubs are sheepish about their start, but not about their goal. Any team with a dedicated party room is comfortable broadcasting its mission. To eliminate all doubt, the Cubs sponsor a billboard on the elevated train tracks above Addison Street, a few blocks from Wrigley Field. Its message is, This story needs a title.It is a clever slogan, and surely it is true. But getting there, and seeing how high the Cubs can go as they try, should be savored. Just dont expect the players to know the major league record for wins.No idea  and we dont care, right fielder Jason Heyward said. We know we need to be in the playoffs, and youve got to be in it to win it. We know were trying to win every game.They know they cannot do that, but they might come pretty close."}

{"text": "Last summer, Yve Laris Cohen, a visual artist and choreographer who knows how to build things, was broke. When he heard that part-time production work was available at the Martha Graham Dance Company  retaping the studios floor and organizing office space  he signed up. He was, as he put it recently, desperate for anything. Even a job paying $15 an hour.The Graham company had no idea that Mr. Laris Cohen, 30, was a 2014 Whitney Biennial artist whose work explores, in part, ideas about labor and value in relation to dance. Hes fond of pointing out the financial discrepancies between uptown and downtown dance, or of showing how a sculpture can be perceived as a set piece in a performance and as a work of art in a museum.What the company eventually learned was that Mr. Laris Cohen was already well established in the dance world. He had rigorous ballet training while growing up in San Diego: on point at 9 (Mr. Laris Cohen, who is transgender, was a female student) and able to whip off 32 fouett turns at 11. He studied the Graham technique at the University of California, Berkeley, in the dance department founded by two former company members, Marnie Thomas Wood and David Wood.Graham is in my body, and it was actually the Graham technique that moved me into postmodern forms from ballet, Mr. Laris Cohen said. It was a major transitional moment for me to be introduced to Graham, and it was really inspiring.Both wage working and modern dance figure into Mr. Laris Cohens current exhibition, Embattled Garden, at Company Gallery on the Lower East Side. As an exhibition, its unconventional: Mr. Laris Cohen has spent the last five weeks there reconstructing the set of Grahams 1958 dance of the same title: a colorful, bisected raked platform and a 12-foot tree by Isamu Noguchi. The gallery is his workshop, the fabrication his performance. The actual Noguchi set is in the space as well.Mr. Laris Cohens intention is to create a replica of the Noguchi set, damaged by flooding during Hurricane Sandy, which the Graham company will be able to use in performance. This project is very much an outgrowth of my relationship to them as a part-time wage worker, Mr. Laris Cohen said. I didnt approach them as an artist; I approached them as a worker.LaRue Allen, the Graham companys executive director, said the organization supported Mr. Laris Cohen in his project because they knew and trusted him. We dont do this willy-nilly for anybody who comes with an inquiry, she said.Mr. Laris Cohen had planned to display his replica alongside Noguchis set on Saturday, the final day of his show. But completing the set is a race against time. This week, he was behind on the trees base because he was waiting for a delivery of metal pieces. Its possible I wont paint the tree base until Saturday, he said, hours before the closing reception.On Thursday, the Graham Company told him he could continue work on the set, off-site, after the show ended. (There will still be a closing reception at which both sets can be viewed.)Working during gallery hours has meant continual interruptions for Mr. Laris Cohen. During a recent visit, a deliveryman arrived for a pickup. Mr. Laris Cohen directed him to the back office and said with a sigh: See? Thats the kind of stuff I do.Ms. Allen would not confirm plans to use the set once its finished; the organization plans to build its own copy with Hudson Scenic Studio. It can become the property of the company, yes, she said. But we have put no restriction on Yve in that it has to serve our purposes.The gallery, which is paying for the set to be rebuilt, will give the replica to the Graham organization. Its not going to be sold, Mr. Laris Cohen said. He is excited to be making, as he explained, objects that are not sculpture and not sets, not architecture, not art objects, not props  yet are all those things at once.Andrew Durbin, the gallerys assistant director, regards the show as an ongoing performance that takes the form, at times, of a kind of exhibition, he said. But since things move so much, its kind of hard to pin it down.For Mr. Laris Cohen, too, Embattled Garden is a different kind of work; its the first time hes not including a traditional performance element. The main art object is really the transaction with the Graham company, Mr. Laris Cohen said. Thats where the dance is."}

{"text": "MOSCOW  As American and allied officials celebrated the opening of a long-awaited missile defense system in Europe with a ribbon cutting and a band, the reaction in Russia on Thursday suggested the system had raised the risks of a nuclear war.Russian officials reiterated their position that the American-built system imperiled Russias security. But the public discussion in Russia was darker, including online commentary of how a nuclear confrontation might play out in Europe, and the prospect that Romania, the systems host, might be reduced to smoking ruins.We have been saying right from when this story started that our experts are convinced that the deployment of the ABM system poses a certain threat to the Russian Federation, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters in a conference call.Measures are being taken to ensure the necessary level of security for Russia, he said. The president himself, let me remind you, has repeatedly asked who the system will work against.The United States has asserted that the anti-ballistic missile system would protect only against rogue states, particularly Iran, and provide no protection for either Europe or the United States from Russias far larger arsenal of nuclear missiles. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization site will be controlled by an American officer.The system, called Aegis Ashore, was essentially transferred from a seaborne launchpad onto land in Romania, at the Deveselu air base. The United States on Friday planned to break ground on a second site, in Poland, that should be completed in 2018. But a deputy United States defense secretary, Robert Work, reiterated Thursday there are no plans at all to strengthen this missile umbrella to protect against Russia.In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said Russian defense experts consider the site a threat.We still view the destructive actions of the United States and its allies in the area of missile defense as a direct threat to global and regional security, Ms. Zakharova said.She said that the Aegis Ashore launchpad was practically identical to a system used aboard Aegis warships that is capable of launching Tomahawk cruise missiles.While the United States says it has no Tomahawk missiles at the site in Romania, Russian officials say the launchpad violates a 1987 treaty intended to take the superpowers off their hair-trigger nuclear alert, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, by banning land-based cruise and medium-range missiles with a range from 300 to 3,400 miles.The short flight time of these missiles diminished to mere minutes the window Soviet leaders would have had after a warning to decide whether to launch a second strike, raising the risks of mishaps. Any redeployment of nuclear-capable missiles in Central Europe would roll the clock back to this nerve-racking 1980s status quo.We have to announce this openly, without any additional diplomatic formulations, Ms. Zakharova said of the Russian assertion the site violates the intermediate-range missile ban. We are talking about violation of this treaty.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has warned that an American antimissile deployment in Eastern Europe could prompt Russia to withdraw from the treaty. The United States last year accused Russia of violating the treaty by failing to declare the true range of two missile types.Last fall, Russian security officials appeared to drop hints of another military response to the missile defense system  a nuclear-armed drone submarine. Russia, this leak appeared to say, has options.During a high-level security meeting, a television camera zoomed in on an open binder showing the weapons design, ostensibly by accident.The drone, according to easily decipherable text accompanying the design drawing, would be capable of carrying a large nuclear device into coastal waters and detonating it, touching off a radioactive tsunami to flood and contaminate seaside cities.The submarine would defeat important economic objects of an enemy in coastal zones, bringing guaranteed and unacceptable losses on the countrys territory by forming a wide area of radioactive contamination incompatible with conducting military, economic or any other activities there for a long period of time, it said.A Russian commentator, Konstantin Bogdanov, wrote on Lenta.ru, a news portal, that the antimissile sites in Eastern Europe might even accelerate the slippery slope to nuclear war in a crisis.They would inevitably become priority targets in the event of nuclear war, possibly even targets for preventive strikes. Countries like Romania that host American antimissile systems might be the only casualties, he wrote, whereas the United States would then reconcile with Russia over the smoking ruins of the East European elements of the missile defense system."}
{"text": "Brushing aside protests from immigrant advocates and both Democratic presidential candidates, the Obama administration is moving ahead with a surge of deportations in the coming weeks, aimed mainly at mothers and children from Central America, immigration officials said Friday.The Department of Homeland Security is stepping up the pace of deportations to send a tough enforcement message to Central America and to try to head off a seasonal swell of illegal crossings of the southwest border, the officials said. Those crossings generally rise during the summer, and administration officials are especially concerned because there was an unexpected increase in the numbers of migrants last fall.The new plans do not include intensive raids like those over one weekend in January, when about 120 women and children were detained for deportation in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas, the officials said. Instead, immigration agents will speed up the arrests of individual families, which they have been making  nationwide since the January raids.Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the department, said those operations focus on migrants who were caught at the border after Jan. 1, 2014, denied asylum by immigration courts, and ordered deported by judges. Agents also will arrest migrants who came when they were minors but turned 18 while fighting deportation in the courts, making them ineligible for protections as children.We must enforce the law consistent with our priorities, Ms. Catron said.The deportation plan, first reported on Thursday by Reuters, drew immediate outrage from advocates and from Democrats in Congress and in the presidential campaign.Im against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities, Hillary Clinton said in a statement. She said families from Central America should be given a full opportunity to seek relief.Her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said, I oppose the painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families who have fled horrendous violence in Central America and other countries.Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, in a statement joined by other House Democrats, said, To conduct these enforcement actions against women and children who have fled violence, and who will face violence if they are returned, is not just hypocritical, it is plain cruel.Despite the wrath of their allies, administration officials are worried they could face another uncontrolled summer influx, like the one in 2014. That could further tarnish President Obamas mixed legacy on immigration and inflame the volatile presidential campaign, where the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has called for construction of a wall along the border with Mexico and the deportation of 11 million immigrants here illegally.Illegal border crossings dropped during the first two months of the year but have risen recently. According to Border Patrol statistics, the apprehension of families at the southwest border from October 2015 to March increased 131 percent over the same six-month period a year earlier  to 32,117 migrants  while the detention of unaccompanied children increased 78 percent, to 27,754.Many women and children said they were running from murderous violence by gangs, especially in El Salvador and Honduras, where criminal organizations control city barrios and have expanded their reach into rural villages. The families applied for asylum, but the vast majority  86 percent, according to a report by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a group that studies federal data  went to court without lawyers. Court records show that asylum seekers have a very low chance of success without lawyers.In some cases, advocates succeeded in stopping deportations at the last minute by providing legal counsel to the families.But the Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, has made it clear he wants people in Central America to know there is no open border.Our highest priority is public safety and border security, Ms. Catron, the spokeswoman, said."}
{"text": "PHOENIX  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who made a name for himself as an unapologetic pursuer of unauthorized immigrants, was found in contempt of court here on Friday for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining Latinos based solely on the suspicion that they were in the country illegally.In a 162-page ruling, Judge G. Murray Snow of United States District Court found that the sheriff had ignored advice from top commanders and his own lawyer and persistently publicized the pursuit and arrests of unauthorized immigrants because he believed those actions benefited his re-election campaign in 2012. Mr. Arpaio, 83, who has said he will run for a seventh term in November, has about $8 million in his campaign war chest, most of it donations from out-of-state residents who champion his tactics of immigration enforcement.Judge Snow said Mr. Arpaio and three current and former aides at the Maricopa County sheriffs office had engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty and bad faith as they continued to racially profile Latinos in traffic stops and workplace raids.Often, Latinos were turned over to federal immigration agencies even though they had not committed any state or federal crimes  and even though the agencies had not formally asked the sheriffs office to do so. In his order, Judge Snow wrote that Mr. Arpaio and his aides  Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan, retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa  have demonstrated a persistent disregard for the orders of the court, as well as an intention to violate and manipulate the laws and policies regulating their conduct.The judge scheduled a hearing for May 31, when both sides are to debate other ways to compel Sheriff Arpaio and his deputies to follow the law. One of the most extreme alternatives is to appoint an outside agency to take over the sheriffs office. Judge Snow could also refer the case for federal criminal prosecution that could result in fines and jail time, options not available in civil cases.His recalcitrance ends here, said Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants Rights Project, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs. Strong remedies are needed to protect the communitys rights, starting with internal investigations that root out misconduct. Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.In an email on Friday, Mr. Arpaios lawyer, John T. Masterson, said, We are in the process of digesting and analyzing the judges order and would file a response by May 27, as the order requires.The ruling confirms an admission by Mr. Arpaio last year that he had ignored the courts order and corrective actions prescribed. It also painstakingly details the methods the sheriff and his office used to violate and manipulate the laws and policies regulating their conduct, Judge Snow wrote, failing their obligations to be fair, equitable and impartial.The case against Sheriff Arpaio began in 2007, when a group of Latinos filed a class-action federal lawsuit against him, accusing him and his deputies of racial profiling. Judge Snow ruled on behalf of the plaintiffs after a three-week trial and ordered changes at the sheriffs office, such as training officers and requiring them to wear body cameras.The purpose was to ensure that the officers understood the constitutional rights of drivers they stopped  and that there was a record of such stops, in case anyone accused the officers of mistreatment. But the sheriffs office had no system or formalized instructions on how to track, collect, review or store the videos taken by the cameras, Judge Snow said. It also did not have a rule prohibiting the officers from taking the recordings and other evidence they collected to their homes, as at least one of them did.The judge said he had reason to believe that many video segments that could have proved officers continuing disregard for his order, issued in December 2011, were destroyed both intentionally and otherwise.There was another problem. Mr. Arpaio and his office did not make a good-faith effort to fairly and impartially investigate and discipline officers misconduct, Judge Snow wrote. According to his ruling, investigations were purposely delayed to justify lesser or no reprimands, disciplinary policies were improperly applied and decisions were put in the hands of biased arbiters. In the end, few officers were investigated and fewer were disciplined.Maricopa County, Arizonas most populous, has paid $41 million in legal costs for the case over eight years and is expected to pay an additional $13 million next year."}
{"text": "MOSCOW  Russia on Friday denied that it had operated a state-sponsored doping program at the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014, calling the allegations raised by a former lab chief groundless.The accusations were made by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of the countrys antidoping laboratory, and were the subject of an article in The New York Times on Thursday.Dr. Rodchenkov, who said he had fled Russia out of fear for his life, controlled the laboratory that tested thousands of Olympians. He said he had created a special cocktail for Russian athletes and described an elaborate scheme by Russias intelligence agency, the F.S.B., to tamper with urine samples in the dead of night in Sochi to avoid detection.Dmitry S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters that the account was not supported by any evidence. These allegations look absolutely groundless, Mr. Peskov told Russian news agencies in a conference call. They are not substantiated by any trustworthy data, they are not backed by any sort of documents. All this simply looks like slander by a turncoat.Dr. Rodchenkov said the doping involved some of Russias most famous winter Olympians and medal winners, including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won gold medals.Two of the athletes named, Alexander Zubkov, a bobsledder who at age 39 was one of the oldest Olympians ever to win gold, and Alexander Legkov, a cross-country skier who won gold and silver, held a hastily convened news conference on Friday to deny the allegations.I have always been absolutely clean, Mr. Zubkov said at the hourlong session, broadcast live on state television. I consider these allegations absolutely groundless.Mr. Legkov suggested that the charges were politically motivated.Based on previous allegations of doping in track and field, there have already been calls to bar Russian athletes from the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer. Dr. Rodchenkovs claims also promise to further complicate Russias efforts to refute other accusations of state-sponsored doping made by a commission of the independent World Anti-Doping Agency.Mr. Legkov, one of the most famous athletes in Russia, said Dr. Rodchenkovs allegation that the drugs were served up in alcohol to mask their presence was especially incredible, since Olympic athletes swore off drinking during their training.That just sounds ridiculous, he said, adding that perhaps Dr. Rodchenkov had been drinking too many of his own cocktails.Yuri Nagornykh, the deputy sports minister, who also appeared at the news conference, denied that Russia had ever had a state-sponsored doping program. All state resources were concentrated on getting the Olympic athletes the best trainers and equipment possible, he said.Theres no doping program in Russian sport, in the Russian Federation; there was none and will be none, he said.Mr. Nagornykh said that if there was any evidence to base an investigation on, Russia would certainly conduct one. But he said that Russia and the athletes named were weighing filing a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Rodchenkov and The Times.Since the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency, two colleagues of Dr. Rodchenkovs, both former high-ranking officials of the state antidoping agency, have died under mysterious circumstances."}
{"text": "A pregnant woman in Puerto Rico has become the first American whose fetus developed microcephaly because of a Zika infection acquired in the United States, the territorys health department said on Friday.Dr. Ana Rus, the islands health secretary, said the fetus, which was not carried to term, had developed a shrunken skull and calcified spots in the brain, suggesting inflammation and cell death.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed the presence of the virus in brain tissue from the fetus, released a statement saying the case saddens and concerns us as it highlights the potential for additional cases and associated adverse pregnancy.The agency has estimated that 20 percent or more of the islands 3.5 million residents will become infected with Zika this year.The Senate is poised to vote next week on funds to combat the spread of the virus, which is expected to arrive in Southern states as summer approaches and the mosquitoes that carry the infection begin to spread north.Administration officials had requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding and have been sharply critical of Republicans in Congress for failing to provide it. The White House has transferred $510 million intended to counter the Ebola virus to the fight against Zika.The fetus in Puerto Rico was miscarried in the second trimester, and a local doctor, suspecting Zika-related brain damage, sent it to the C.D.C., said Dr. Johnny Rullan, a former territorial health secretary who is an adviser to the governor for the epidemic. He did not know at what week of pregnancy the miscarriage occurred, but congenital brain damage related to Zika has been detected as early as the 19th week.The territory has had only 925 confirmed cases of Zika infection to date, but health officials assume there have been tens of thousands of unreported cases. Of the confirmed ones, 128 have involved pregnant women.Sixteen of the infected women have given birth so far, and the babies are progressing normally, Dr. Rus told El Nuevo Dia, a local paper. The children will be monitored for three years.Dr. Rullan suspects that there have been 80,000 infections since January, assuming about 10,000 cases for each case of Guillain-Barr syndrome, a creeping paralysis caused by an autoimmune attack on the peripheral nerves triggered by a Zika infection.As of this week, there have been eight confirmed Guillain-Barr cases since the year began.Puerto Rico has also seen one Zika-related death in an adult. It occurred in February in a man in his 70s who recovered from Zika but succumbed to immune thrombocytopenic purpura, another type of autoimmune reaction.There have been two other cases of microcephaly in the United States thought to be related to Zika. One involved a child born to a woman in Hawaii who had spent the early part of her pregnancy in Brazil. The other involved a pregnancy aborted by a Washington, D.C., woman who became infected on a trip through Mexico, Belize and Guatemala.Only about a third of the roughly 15,000 pregnant women in Puerto Rico have been tested, Dr. Rullan said.The doctors are not being aggressive enough, and the insurance companies are not, he said. We had a conference, and I told them we need to do all 15,000 immediately, whether they have symptoms or not.He added, I think a case of microcephaly will get people going."}
{"text": "OTTAWA  After taking a helicopter tour of fire-ravaged Fort McMurray, Alberta, on Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau credited firefighters for saving much of the city.An official count found that 2,432 buildings were destroyed and 500 were damaged. About 25,000 buildings are still standing but may have smoke damage.I dont think Canadians yet understand what happened here, Mr. Trudeau told firefighters and rescue workers after touring the city. They know there was a fire. Theyre beginning to hear the wonderful news that so much of the town was safe. They dont yet understand that this wasnt a fluke of wind or rain or luck, that this was the extraordinary response by people such as yourselves  the work you did to save so much of this community.It was Mr. Trudeaus first visit to Fort McMurray since 88,000 people were forced to evacuate the area on May 3 when a wildfire, which continues to burn, swept into the city, which is the hub of Canadas oil sands region.Accompanied by Rachel Notley, Albertas premier, Darby Allen, the regional fire chief, and others, Mr. Trudeau viewed from a military helicopter the wide blackened trail left around and through the city by the wildfire. Later, while walking through one of the residential neighborhoods leveled by the fire, he paused and picked up a Mason jar from rubble near the ruins of one house. The heat of the fire had melted it into a surrealistic shape.At a news conference later in Edmonton, Mr. Trudeau talked about seeing a childs abandoned scooter looking sad and forlorn on a sidewalk in an otherwise burned-out neighborhood.That little plastic scooter, whatever little boy or girl was using that before the evacuation, theyre safe, theyre alive, he said. No one is known to have died directly because of the fire.Because firefighting is primarily a provincial and municipal responsibility in Canada, the federal governments role in dealing with the disaster has been comparatively limited so far. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is Fort McMurrays law enforcement service, under a contract with Alberta. The military has provided logistical support, including helicopters and a heavy-lift airplane.A special emergency response team from the Canadian Forces is helping the provinces health ministry open a temporary medical center. While firefighters were able to divert the blaze away from the citys hospital, it has extensive smoke damage and problems with its heating and air-conditioning.But while the province has not needed to call on many federal resources, Mr. Trudeaus government is likely to take on an increasingly important role as the fire threat recedes and officials move toward allowing residents to re-enter the city  something that is probably still weeks away  and planning Fort McMurrays reconstruction.Figures vary wildly about the cost of the fire but it will certainly be in the billions of dollars and far beyond the means of Alberta, which has been struggling financially because of the collapse of oil prices.The federal government will reimburse Alberta for 90 percent of its costs. But after other recent Alberta disasters, including floods three years ago, the province and the federal government became mired in protracted negotiations over what costs were eligible.Mr. Trudeau said that his government would move more quickly than the previous Conservative government to provide significant federal moneys to Alberta.The federal government has already accelerated the process for making unemployment insurance claims for Fort McMurray residents left jobless by the fire.The bulk of the oil sands projects, which provide the basis of Fort McMurrays economy, lay north of the city. While operations were shut down or severely curtailed at the height of the blaze, most are now slowly resuming. The police have reopened the only highway through Fort McMurray to allow workers to travel to company work camps. The government is also inviting store and business owners to return to the city to assess their ability to reopen.About 1,000 workers are also in the Fort McMurray area, repairing damage to electrical wires and components, and aboveground equipment for pipelines.The fire has prompted an exceptionally large flow of donations from Canadians. The Canadian Red Cross, which governments have designated as the primary relief agency, had raised 86 million Canadian dollars, or about $67 million, from a population of 36 million as of Friday afternoon."}
{"text": "LONDON  The bodies have been dumped on doorsteps with chilling regularity. There was Oscar, an 8-year-old tabby, his head and tail cut off; Oreo, a Siamese kitten left at the bottom of a garden, decapitated and with her collar lying across her body; and Paddy, who had been hacked in half. The missing heads have not been found; they might have been kept as trophies.The gruesome killings and mutilations of scores of cats in London over the past six months, starting in the South London neighborhood of Croydon, are stoking fears of a dangerous sadist in this city of animal lovers. Several newspapers and broadcasters have taken to calling the killer the Croydon Cat Ripper.Because animals cannot report incidents of abuse against them and can do little to fight back, they are the perfect practice victims for violent people, said Elisa Allen, associate director of the British chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. The pain and fear that any of these cats experienced is unimaginable.PETA is offering a reward of just over $7,000 for information leading to an arrest.The pattern of attacks first came to light last fall when South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty, a local organization, began to document the cat deaths. Tony Jenkins, who runs the group with his girlfriend, Boudicca Rising, said they had documented 46 cats that they believed had been killed, possibly by the same person or people.After each killing, the couple, who have been working with the police, have gone to the scene to photograph and retrieve the body.The cat killer is clever, operates in darkness in mostly residential neighborhoods away from surveillance video cameras, said Mr. Jenkins, adding, The aim is obviously to inflict maximum distress.When reports of the killings first emerged, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Britains best-known animal welfare charity, treated them as car accidents followed by mutilations by foxes, which are ubiquitous in London.But as the bodies piled up, Mike Butcher, an investigator at the charity, asked a specialist at the Royal Veterinary College to perform autopsies on 20 of the cats. In 44 years of investigating animal cruelty, he said, he had never seen such systematic brutality.Scotland Yard has confirmed that at least 20 cats have been killed, and that at least 19 of the killings appeared to be linked. Alex Stoll, the veterinary forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortems, said the cats had died from blunt force trauma before being mutilated by a sharp implement, probably wielded by a human being. (He emphasized that he did not rule out the possibility that the cats had first been run over by a car.)Swabbing a cat for DNA traces, Dr. Stoll added, would be unlikely to help catch the culprit because cats are petted by so many people.No arrests have been made. At this stage, the exact nature of any offense committed is not clear, and the ongoing investigation is committed to seeking any evidence or information that will assist this, Scotland Yard said in a statement.While there is no evidence to suggest that humans are at direct risk, some notorious serial killers  for example, the so-called Boston Strangler, Albert H. DeSalvo, who confessed to killing 13 women in the early 1960s; and Jeffrey L. Dahmer, whose acts of murder and necrophilia came to light in 1991  began with animal cruelty.The string of cat killings in London has left many of the pets owners traumatized.Naomi Chauhan, 27, an events manager from Brackley, a town in south Northamptonshire, was so enamored of her 1-year-old white and ginger cat Ivy that she splurged on a pet sofa, a drinking fountain and a special electronic cat flap that recognizes a pets ID chip in an effort to keep unwanted visitors away. My cats are my babies, she said.When Ms. Chauhan discovered that Ivy was missing on a Thursday evening last month, she searched everywhere. The next morning, she combed the neighborhood in her car and spotted a cat lying near a road, 500 yards from her home. When she got closer, she was overcome by horror: Ivy had no head.It was very clean and clinical, she said. This was no accident. There was no blood. A fox wouldnt have done it that way.Ms. Chauhan says she has fallen into depression and has not been able to go to work since the discovery. How could anyone do this? she asked.In Britain, animal cruelty can carry a fine of up to about $29,000 and a sentence of up to six months in prison. After the cat killings, animal-rights groups have been calling for tougher penalties and for the creation of an offense of animal murder.In the United States, the F.B.I. recently began counting animal cruelty in its annual statistics on felonies and other crimes.In Croydon, Mr. Jenkins, from the South Norwood animal welfare group, has appealed for information from the public. The killings have spawned no shortage of conspiracy theories. Tips have poured in, with some of the more outlandish ones blaming satanic worshipers or the Islamic State. While the killings remain unsolved, cat flaps are being nailed closed, pets shut indoors and difficult news kept from children.My daughter kept asking when Barney was coming home, said Danielle Bowden, a 42-year-old from southeast London, whose cat was beheaded. She told her three young children that Barney had been struck by a car."}
{"text": "DENVER  Coors Field is hardly the kind of controlled laboratory in which to make conclusions about a baseball players performance. Hitters thrive in the high altitude, and pitchers suffer correspondingly.Matt Harvey has always had great success against the Colorado Rockies, but none of those games were at Coors Field. He made his debut here Friday, and it did not go well.Harvey allowed five runs and a staggering 11 hits in five and two-thirds innings as the Rockies beat the Mets, 5-2, in another disappointing start by Harvey.Jon Gray, the Rockies rookie starter and a former first-round draft pick, earned his first career win and also collected his first hit, a single off Harvey in the fifth, as the Rockies ended an 11-game losing streak at the hands of the Mets.Its frustrating, Harvey said. From one start to the next, it doesnt feel the same at all. It wasnt the ballpark or anything like that. It was me.The 11 hits were the most Harvey has surrendered since he allowed 13 on Aug. 24, 2013, against the Detroit Tigers. That was his last outing before having Tommy John surgery.Harvey, who threw 216 innings last year including the postseason, said he had no physical problems.My body feels fine, he said. Its just frustrating being out there right now.His record is now 3-5 with a 4.93 E.R.A., a surprising number for a pitcher who has never even finished a season with an E.R.A. over 3.00.He did not allow any home runs, but the Rockies produced four extra-base hits against Harvey, who threw many of his fastballs at 92 and 93 miles per hour, a touch slower than his previous outing in San Diego, where it seemed as if he were solving some of the puzzling problems that have led to his confounding season.But Manager Terry Collins said the reduced zip on Harveys fastball pitches was not a concern.Not really, Collins said. I saw him in 13 when he was lights out. There was some nights when he was 97 and other nights he pitched at 94, 95.What is a concern, he said, is just the consistency of making quality pitches.Before Fridays game, Harvey was 2-0 in three starts against the Rockies, allowing only one earned run over 23 innings for a microscopic 0.39 E.R.A.But he gave up twice that number in the fourth inning alone, thanks in large part to a misplay by left fielder Michael Conforto during a sequence in which the Rockies smacked three straight hits.With the Mets ahead, 2-0, Nolan Arenado rapped a single to left. Then Gerardo Parra banged a sinking line drive to left.Conforto ran in hard and to his left, but the ball bounced in front of him and under his glove and rolled all the way to the wall, where center fielder Yoenis Cespedes had to retrieve it.Arenado scored easily and Parra huffed into third base on what was ruled a triple. Two pitches later Harvey left a slider right over the plate that Mark Reynolds lashed into center field, scoring Parra to draw the Rockies even.The Rockies added another run in the fifth, but Harvey did well to limit the damage. The rally began with Gray, who collected his first major league hit on a bouncer up the middle.He went to second base on an infield hit by Charlie Blackmon and scored on a double by the rookie Trevor Story, giving the Rockies a 3-2 lead. At that point, with runners at second and third, no outs and the meat of the Rockies order due up, the Mets instructed Hansel Robles to warm up in the bullpen.But Harvey got the next three batters out to strand the runners. Carlos Gonzalez popped up, Arenado hit a soft liner to Neil Walker at second, and Parra hit a weak grounder to the shortstop.Still, as the hits mounted, so did Harveys pitch count. He gave up another run in the sixth  the inning that has bedeviled him this season  on a double by D. J. LeMahieu and a single by Tony Wolters.It was the ninth run Harvey has given up in the equivalent of five and two-thirds innings of pitching during the sixth inning this year. He wound up being charged with another. After he struck out Gray, Collins took the ball from Harvey and handed it to Jerry Blevins.Blackmon, a left-handed hitter, was Blevinss first assignment, and he rocketed a ball high off the wall in right field to score Wolters and drive Harveys E.R.A. even higher.Im just not feeling comfortable throwing the baseball right now, he said."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes.Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a 26-year-old model, did as Mr. Trump asked. I went into the bathroom and tried one on, she recalled. It was a bikini. I came out, and he said, Wow. Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to show her off to the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla.He brought me out to the pool and said, That is a stunning Trump girl, isnt it?  Ms. Brewer Lane said.Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insults, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a campaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president: degrading, impersonal, performed. That must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees, he told a female contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice. Rosie ODonnell, he said, had a fat, ugly face. A lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newborn? Disgusting, he said.But the 1990 episode at Mar-a-Lago that Ms. Brewer Lane described was different: a debasing face-to-face encounter between Mr. Trump and a young woman he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the up-close and more intimate encounters.The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks.Their accounts  many relayed here in their own words  reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interactions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who experienced them.What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around him, one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and encouraging. He promoted several to the loftiest heights of his company, a daring move for a major real estate developer at the time.He simultaneously nurtured womens careers and mocked their physical appearance. You like your candy, he told an overweight female executive who oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He could be lewd one moment and gentlemanly the next.In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, someone who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. It would just seem, he said, that there was something that they want to really prove.Pressed on the womens claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details, such as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a swimsuit. A lot of things get made up over the years, he said. I have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that.But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump had the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He had connections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the women sought his assistance with their careers or remained by his side.For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was the start of a whirlwind romance  a heady blur of helicopter rides and high-end hotel rooms and flashing cameras.It was intimidating, she said. He was Donald Trump, obviously.It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding school 90 minutes drive north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited girls from setting foot on the all-boys campus unless it was a special occasion. And on those special occasions, young Donald Trump paid careful mind to the kind of girls he brought to school. They had to be gorgeous  10s, in his future parlance.Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to campus were pretty, recalled George White, a fellow student in the class of 1964.For Donald, he added, its display.He steadily built an image as a young playboy amid the deprivations of a single-sex military school, where most boys craved but rarely enjoyed the company of a girl. By senior year, his classmates had crowned him ladies man in the yearbook, a nod to the volume of his dates.Asked how he had earned the ladies man title, Mr. Trump at first demurred. I better not tell you  Ill get myself in trouble, he said. He later elaborated, saying he had a great feeling and a great like for women.Mr. Trump grew up with an influential role model for how to deal with women: Fred C. Trump, his powerful and unyielding father.The elder Mr. Trump exerted control no matter how big or small the decision, as Ivana Zelnickova learned over dinner one night in the late 1970s. Her boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parents at Tavern on the Green, the ornate restaurant in Central Park.When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking for what she wanted. Fred Trump set her straight, she recalled in a previously unpublished interview with Michael DAntonio, the author of The Truth About Trump.Mr. Trump defended his fathers conduct. He wouldve said that out of love, he said. If his father had overruled her fish order, Mr. Trump said, he would have said that only on the basis that he thought, That would be better for her. The elder Mr. Trump did not hide his more traditional views on gender. When his son hired a woman, Barbara A. Res, as his head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and annoyed.Mr. Trump said it was a different era. My father, he said, probably never would have seen a woman in that position.Mr. Trump still holds up his parents as models, praising his stay-at-home mother for understanding and accommodating a husband who worked almost nonstop.My mother was always fine with it, he said, recalling her brilliant management of the situation. If something got interrupted because he was going to inspect a housing site or something, she would handle that so beautifully.She was an ideal woman, he said.With his purchase of the Miss Universe Organization, Mr. Trump was now in the business of young, beautiful women.They craved his advice and approval, a fact he seemed to understand well.Temple Taggart, the 21-year-old Miss Utah, was startled by how forward he was with young contestants like her in 1997, his first year as the owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner.Mr. Trump disputes this, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips. But Ms. Taggart said it was not an isolated incident.At the gala celebration after the show, she said, Mr. Trump immediately zeroed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her to visit him in New York to talk about her future. Soon enough, she said, he delivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. After boasting of his connections to elite modeling agencies, he advised her to lie about her age to get ahead in the industry, she said. Were going to have to tell them youre 17,  Ms. Taggart recalled him telling her, because in his mind, 21 is too old. I was like, No, were not going to do that. His level of involvement in the pageants was unexpected, and his judgments, the contestants said, could be harsh. Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when she participated in the Miss USA contest in 2009 as Miss California, was surprised to find Mr. Trump personally evaluating the women at rehearsal. We were told to put on our opening number outfits  they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits  and line up for him onstage, she wrote in her memoir, Still Standing.Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would never do that. Such behavior, he said, would bruise egos and hurt feelings. I wouldnt hurt people, he said. Thats hurtful to people.Mr. Trump was not just fixated on the appearance of the women around him. He possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it.Inside the Trump Organization, the company that manages his various businesses, he occasionally interrupted routine discussions of business to opine on womens figures. Ms. Res, his construction executive, remembered a meeting in which she and Mr. Trump interviewed an architect for a project in the Los Angeles area. Out of the blue, she said, Mr. Trump evaluated the fitness of women in Marina del Rey, Calif. They take care of their asses, he said.The architect and I didnt know where he was coming from, Ms. Res said. Years later, after she had gained a significant amount of weight, Ms. Res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from Mr. Trump.  You like your candy,  she recalled him telling her. It was him reminding me that I was overweight.Her colleague Louise Sunshine experienced similar observations from Mr. Trump when she gained weight. But she saw it as friendly encouragement, not a cruel insult. He thought I looked much better thin, she said. He would remind me of how beautiful I was.Whenever possible, Mr. Trump wanted his visitors to see his most attractive employees, as Ms. Res learned.Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances  at times from strangers  that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughters body. Dont you think my daughters hot? Shes hot, right?  Ms. Lee recalled him saying. I was like, Really? Thats just weird. She was 16. Thats creepy.Ms. Brewer Lane, who dated Mr. Trump for several months in 1990 and early 1991, said it did not take long for him to solicit her view on the attractiveness of two of his previous romantic partners, Marla Maples and Ivana Trump.Mr. Trump said he did not know Ms. Brewer Lane very well, despite dating her. I wouldnt have asked anybody about how they rate other women, he said.He liked to brag about his sexual prowess and his desirability as a date, no matter who was around.Barbara J. Fife, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, New Yorks mayor in the early 1990s, was not especially close to Mr. Trump. But that did not stop him from telling her why he was in such a hurry one day as he sat in her office at City Hall.I have this great date tonight with a model for Victorias Secret, Ms. Fife recalled him telling her.I saw it as immature, quite honestly, she said.At his office in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump seemed eager for his colleagues to hear about his new companion, Ms. Maples. When The New York Post feasted on her supposed satisfaction with him in bed, captured in the headline Best Sex Ive Ever Had, Mr. Trump was unabashed, Ms. Res said.Mr. Trump denies boasting about the headline. He seems more bashful these days, saying he cannot recall how many women he has dated. Not as many as people would think, he said. Im not somebody that really loved the dating process.To build his business, Mr. Trump turned to women for a simple reason: They worked hard  often harder than men, he told them.When Mr. Trump hired Ms. Res to oversee the construction of Trump Tower, he invited her to his apartment on Fifth Avenue and explained that he wanted her to be his Donna Trump on the project, she said. Few women had reached such stature in the industry.He entrusted several women in his company with enormous responsibility  once they had proven themselves worthy and loyal. Ms. Sunshine had little experience in real estate, but as a top campaign fund-raiser for Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, she had fulfilled a lifelong wish for Mr. Trump: She secured him a vanity license plate with his initials, DJT, which adorned his limousine for years.Ms. Sunshine worked for Mr. Trump for 15 years, becoming a major New York real estate figure in her own right. Ms. Res remained at the company for 12 years, left after a disagreement over a project and then returned as a consultant for six more years. Both expressed gratitude for the chances Mr. Trump had taken on them.In a rough-and-tumble industry thoroughly dominated by men, Mr. Trumps office stood out for its diversity, recalled Alan Lapidus, an influential architect who designed the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City.To women who had climbed to positions of power outside his company, Mr. Trumps behavior could feel like a jarring throwback.Alair A. Townsend was for a time the highest-ranking woman inside New Yorks City Hall during the Koch administration, with the title of deputy mayor for economic development. But when Mr. Trump called her, she said, her position seemed less relevant to him than her gender.It was an unthinking habit when he interacted with women, colleagues said. At Trump Tower, said Ms. Res, his longtime colleague, he called me Honey Bunch.No single figure better encapsulated the paradoxes of Mr. Trumps treatment of women in the workplace than his first wife, Ivana.He entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her the titles to match. She was the president of Trumps Castle, a major casino in Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel, the storied complex on Central Park South in Manhattan. She ran that hotel, Ms. Res said. And she ran it well.But he compensated her as a spouse, not a high-level employee, paying her an annual salary of $1 for the Trumps Castle job, according to her tax documents. And he grew to resent her outsize role. By the end of their marriage, Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback, he regretted having allowed her to run his businesses.He seems to have kept his word. His current wife, Melania, has marketed her own lines of beauty products and jewelry. But Mr. Trump remains mostly uninvolved in her work. After calling it very successful, he struggled to describe it.What is it on television with the sales? he asked. What do they call that? Not Home Shopping, the other one.Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most serious allegations of aggression toward women.When Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, by the journalist Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a night in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage. It also included a statement from Ivana that Mr. Trumps lawyers insisted be placed in the front of the book. In the statement, she described an occasion of marital relations during which I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent.During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me, the statement said. I referred to this as a rape, but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for comment. After the allegation re-emerged in the news media last year, Ivana said in a statement, The story is totally without merit.In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Houraney, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and later accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their business dealings. In a 1996 deposition, Ms. Harth described their initial meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower.Mr. Houraney said in a recent interview that he was shocked by Mr. Trumps response after he made clear that he and Ms. Harth were monogamous.He said: Well, theres always a first time. I am going after her,  Mr. Houraney recalled, adding: I thought the man was joking. I laughed. He said, I am serious. By the time the three of them were having dinner at the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel the next night, Mr. Trumps advances had turned physical, Ms. Harth said in the deposition.Basically he name-dropped throughout that dinner, when he wasnt groping me under the table, she testified. Let me just say, this was a very traumatic thing working for him.Ms. Harth, who declined to comment, gave the deposition in connection with a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump had failed to meet his obligations in a business partnership. Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. Ms. Harth withdrew her own lawsuit against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances, but she has stood by her original claims.Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shared email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump for helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for his presidential candidacy.Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women.He sees himself as a promoter of women  a man whose business deals, like the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them untold opportunities for employment and advancement. Hundreds and hundreds of women, thousands of women, are the better for it, he said.He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief executive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that of the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female worker.Several women who have held positions of power within the Trump Organization in recent years said they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women or treat them with disrespect.I think there are mischaracterizations about him, said Jill Martin, a vice president and assistant counsel at the company. Ms. Martin said Mr. Trump had enthusiastically supported her decision to have two children over the past five years, even when it meant working from home and scaling back on business travel.Thats hard with women lawyers, she said. For me, hes made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family.After competing in the 2009 Miss USA pageant, Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a Bulgarian immigrant who lived in Utah, met with Mr. Trump in his New York office and explained that she wanted to make a documentary about her home country. Mr. Trump encouraged the project and followed through on a promise to put her in touch with his production company.He genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how he could help, Ms. Chukanov said.But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting damage on their lives.After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very human happened: She gained weight. Mr. Trump did not keep his critique of her changing body quiet  he publicly shamed her, she said.Mr. Trump said he had pushed her to lose weight. To that, I will plead guilty, he said, expressing no regret for his tactics.But the humiliation, Ms. Machado said, was unbearable. After that episode, I was sick, anorexia and bulimia for five years, she said. Over the past 20 years, Ive gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this."}
{"text": "DENVER  The last time Matt Harvey could recall struggling as a baseball pitcher  the only time, really  was in 2009 when he was a sophomore at the University of North Carolina.Opposing hitters were punishing him to the rate of a 5.40 E.R.A. But, Harvey said, the poor spell left as quickly as it came, and from there forward he has excelled.Until this year.For the first time in Harveys professional career, he is enduring bad results for an extended time, and he does not have an answer. After his latest disappointing outing Friday night  a 5-2 loss to the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field  Harvey said he just feels uncomfortable on the mound.More than anything, he seemed bewildered.Certain pitches, its fine, he said. Throughout the game, its progressively getting worse.That is troubling for Harvey, who gave up 11 hits and five earned runs in five and two-thirds innings against the Rockies in his eighth start of the season. He is 3-5 with a 4.93 E.R.A. In his major league career, he has never ended a season with an E.R.A. above 2.73.After a successful start in San Diego last Sunday, the velocity on Harveys pitches dipped on Friday. He began well against the Rockies, but then he began to leave pitches up in the strike zone and over the plate  a familiar pattern so far this season.They were hittable pitches, as the Rockies demonstrated. The only other time he has surrendered more hits was against the Tigers in 2013, when he gave up 13 in his last start before having Tommy John surgery.Harvey threw a career-high 216 innings last season, so there are concerns that he feels fatigued. But Harvey denies having physical problems. There is no pain in his elbow, he said, and he does not feel tired or weak.Manager Terry Collins was asked if he was concerned about Harveys dip in velocity on Friday, as well as in some of his other starts. Collins paused five seconds before answering that Harvey had shown a wide range of speeds on his fastball even during some of his most successful seasons.Whatever the problem is, it has left Harvey disconcerted.Its something Ive obviously done my whole life, Harvey said, stand on the mound and throw a baseball, and right now its not an easy task. Ive got to keep my head down and keep focused and keep pushing to figure it out.In his first three seasons in the majors, Harvey did not have to spend a lot of time tinkering with his pitching motion, staring at videotape, brainstorming with the pitching coach Dan Warthen about what to try next, or walking off the mound dejected and frustrated after handing the ball to Collins.It is hard, Collins said. A great statement I heard the other day: Theres two kinds of players in this league  ones who have been humbled, and those who will be. When its your turn, it gets tough to take sometimes, because youve got to learn how to adjust to it and learn how to bounce back from it.Collins said that Warthen had spotted a few things on video, particularly the release point on Harveys pitches  where his hand is when he lets go of the ball. Collins said Harvey and Warthen had been working on it in the bullpen between starts, but Harvey dismissed that as the cause of his problems.Theres a lot of unknowns, he said.His first foray into the world of problem-solving for pitchers could also be taking a mental toll. At times, Harvey acknowledged, he is thinking too much about what he is doing when he delivers the baseball. For a dominant pitcher like Harvey, it tends to work better when he just rears back and fires away.You start overthinking pretty much everything, he said. Thats the way it kind of feels every pitch. So, hopefully, we can get past that."}

{"text": "BEIJING  Fifty years after his father was killed, Chen Shuxiang still wonders what happened to his bloodied corpse. He keeps a frayed note from back then that let him make his way through the mayhem of the Cultural Revolution and pay the student zealots who beat his father to death to have him cremated.He never found his fathers body. Ever since, he has hoped for answers, and waited for the students who killed his father to turn up, older and contrite, and say they were sorry. No one has.Mr. Chen is still waiting for a frank reckoning with the legacy of Maos Cultural Revolution, and so is China.Just before he died, my father wasnt even allowed a mouthful of water, said Mr. Chen, 72, a retired teacher who lives in northwest Beijing, a few minutes walk from where his father lived. Its something I dont like to think about even now, but also I want to hear from those who did this.Why did they pick him out? Where did his ashes end up?Half a century after Mao Zedong started the Cultural Revolution, his tumultuous drive to enlist ordinary Chinese to purge the country of ideological foes, many who lived through that time believe its legacy still haunts their country.From its official beginning on May 16, 1966, until it fizzled out with Maos death in 1976, perhaps a million or more people were killed, tens of millions were persecuted, the economy stagnated, and thousands of historical and cultural monuments were destroyed.The Communist Party officially condemned the movement in 1981, declaring it responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Peoples Republic since its founding in 1949.But China has yet to squarely face up to the era. The party has lately become even more hostile to scrutiny of Mao, unwilling to confront touchy questions about his and the partys unbridled power, or to dredge up contested memories of a time when perpetrators often became victims themselves.The suppression of memory has blocked the kind of airing out of the episode  much less the assigning of legal culpability  that many who endured it believe could help the country move forward.Historians in China often cannot publish research about the Cultural Revolution. Textbooks scurry past that time. Many young people have no idea that their schools were once battlegrounds for the student militants, known as Red Guards. This year, the government has not held any memorials for the anniversary and has discouraged public mourning.The Communist Party holds power, and this is a dark mark against it, said Chen Bing, a student at the time at the school where Mr. Chens father was killed. If it publicizes this too much, thats like staining its own reputation.Many survivors, former Red Guards and historians said the official reticence had permitted a dangerous nostalgia for Maos time.They see no risk of a full-scale repeat of the Cultural Revolution. President Xi Jinping has none of Maos appetite for upheaval, and Chinese society is far less rigid and isolated now. But many said they worried about a return of the harsh political tactics, ideological zealotry and absolutist pronouncements that fed the fury of the Red Guards, Maos teenage political shock troops.Their fears have grown under Mr. Xi. The presidents family suffered grievously during the Cultural Revolution. His father was purged by Mao and persecuted by Red Guards, his sister is believed to have been driven to suicide by Red Guards, and Mr. Xi himself drifted around Beijing as strife consumed the city.But in a turn that historians still puzzle over, as an adult politician Mr. Xi has publicly revered Mao. And since he took power in 2012, critics have detected traces of Mao as he has  clamped down on dissent and amassed formidable power.If the ghosts of the Cultural Revolution are not dispersed and are allowed to grow, well slide in the direction of another Cultural Revolution, said Bu Weihua, a former Red Guard who attended the high school where Mr. Chen was a student and then teacher. Mr. Bu became one of Chinas most respected historians of the era. More dregs of Cultural Revolution rhetoric, methods and doctrines will float up.To many, the recent Communist Party-backed denunciations of a retired real estate developer who chided Mr. Xi were reminiscent of Cultural Revolution-style purges. Others have criticized a recent performance eulogizing Mao in the Great Hall of the People as a disturbing sign.People who didnt experience the Cultural Revolution know only that many officials were persecuted, but they dont know that the numbers of ordinary people who suffered were 10 times, a hundred times, more, Yang Jisheng, a Chinese historian who has come under official pressure over his critical studies of the Maoist era, said in a recent speech in Beijing. Unfortunately, nowadays there are some people doing everything in their power to cover up the mistakes of history.The Cultural Revolution was Maos campaign to root out internal enemies who, he said, had been seduced by capitalism and the revisionist compromises of the Soviet Union. Students formed Red Guard groups to enforce Maos will, he gave them his blessing, and the tumult escalated, especially in schools, where students condemned teachers and officials.Before retiring, Mr. Chen was an instructor at the prestigious Tsinghua University High School, the birthplace of the first Red Guard group. But even as students there moved from tirades against teachers to physical humiliation, with witch hats and parades, to beatings, Mr. Chen thought that his family was safe.His father was solidly working class, a barely educated boiler operator whose own father had done the same humble job. His mother washed clothes for extra cash. Mr. Chen, the eldest of seven children, had given up hopes of entering a university so that he could help support his siblings. He found a job as an instructor at the same high school where he had studied.But on the evening of Aug. 27, 1966, as he turned the corner to his familys home, he saw more than a dozen youths in green uniforms with red armbands, the favored uniform of Red Guards, Mr. Chen said. A neighbor spotted Mr. Chen and waved him away.When he crept back that night, the home was a shambles. His brothers and sisters were bawling; the dumplings his mother had been preparing for dinner were squashed on the walls and floor; his parents were missing.The next morning, his mother, Liu Wancai, stumbled home, barely able to talk, her clothes torn, her face covered in blood.What about Dad? Mr. Chen asked, according to his privately published memoir.He was killed, his mother said. Its true. He died beside me.Ms. Liu and her husband had been taken by Red Guards, and he was accused of being a class enemy, she told Mr. Chen. The family of Mr. Chens father had once owned about three acres of land, enough to label the father a landlord, anathema to the revolution.The teenage mob threw the couple into the back of a truck and took them to a school where they were beaten with military-style leather belts, the favorite punishment tool of Red Guards; a jump-rope twisted into a whip; and shoes with nails jutting out, Ms. Liu later said. The mob then drove the couple to another school where the beating continued, including with iron rods.The father, Chen Yanrong, 37, insisted that the landlord label was wrong; his family had long given up the property. But back then, the younger Mr. Chen said, the more you denied something, the more you were beaten.As he lay in his own blood, Chen Yanrong begged for water. The students said no, and he stopped breathing soon after.There was some randomness to who was seized upon, said Guobin Yang, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of a new study, The Red Guard Generation and Political Activism in China. The most important thing was really to show that we  the organization  were the real revolutionaries.By later official accounts, 1,772 people were killed in the tumult across Beijing in August and September 1966. There were probably more, including suicides and people killed after being expelled from the city.The Red Guards who took Mr. Chens parents came from one of the citys top schools, Peking University High School, according to his mother as well as later official documents.They were among the first wave of Red Guards, who were usually the offspring of party officials. Later Mao turned on his own political elite, and the first wave fell from grace, giving way to new rebel Red Guard factions that then waged bloody battles against other Red Guard factions.The day after his father was seized, Mr. Chen asked Red Guards from his school to write a note allowing him to go to Peking University High School to pay the Red Guards there for the cremation. But at the school gate, he heard people say that there had been ruthless beatings there overnight and that two corpses had been taken away.Afraid, Mr. Chen left without entering or seeing his fathers body. He still has the note, tucked away in the back of a picture frame.His mother died in 2011, and was never able to identify her attackers. The family left space at her grave for her husbands remains, should they ever be found.After Mao died in 1976, the family received 2,500 renminbi, equal to about $380 at current exchange rates but a more generous sum back then, in compensation for the fathers death. Peking University High School also gave the family a statement acknowledging that the schools Red Guards, who called themselves the Red Flag Struggle Group, had killed him.But no one has ever come forward to take responsibility for the death, Mr. Chen said.Peng Xiaomeng, a former leader of the Red Flag group who is now in her late 60s, has worked under a different name as an editor for an economic policy journal in Beijing. Reached by telephone, she seemed startled to be asked about events 50 years ago but said she did not recall the episode.I really dont know whether it was the Red Flag group, she said. I have nothing else to say.Mr. Chen stood by his mothers recollections, which were corroborated by official documents.Even now, these people are all like this, all evading responsibility, he said, his voice choking. They say: I wasnt at the school. I wasnt at the meeting. I didnt know. After 50 years, he said, they still havent gained any understanding."}
{"text": "Its relatively easy to determine when someone is too drunk to drive. If a drivers blood-alcohol level is 0.08 percent or higher, that person is considered legally impaired. But a study says that measuring the effects of marijuana on drivers is far trickier, and that blood tests are an unreliable indication of impairment by cannabis.As more states consider legalizing the substance, that presents a challenge to legislators seeking to create laws on driving while impaired by marijuana.The study, commissioned by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, found that laws in six states that legally assess impairment by measuring how much THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) is in a persons blood are not supported by science.There is no concentration of the drug that allows us to reliably predict that someone is impaired behind the wheel in the way that we can with alcohol, said Jake Nelson, AAAs director of traffic safety advocacy and research.Lawmakers in those states looked to policies on drunken driving for cues on how to legislate against driving while high. But the body absorbs alcohol and cannabis in different ways, the study said. While drunkenness directly correlates to alcohol in the bloodstream, cannabis impairment takes place only when THC makes its way into the fatty tissue of the brain.Regular marijuana users, including those who take the drug medicinally, often show no signs of impairment after using, according to Jolene Forman, a staff lawyer for the Drug Policy Alliance, a drug-reform advocacy group. She also said that marijuana can stay in the blood for hours, days and even weeks after its effects wear off.As a result, the presence of THC in blood is not a useful indicator of whether the drug is impairing that persons ability to drive. Furthermore, the study said, The practical reality of identifying evaluating, arresting and sampling suspected impaired drivers means that the THC concentration measured in the blood specimen reflects neither the concentration in the subjects blood at the time of arrest, nor the concentration of active drug in the brain.In Montana, Washington, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada, drivers are presumed guilty if they have a certain amount of THC in their blood. Colorado also uses a threshold to assess impairment, though it allows suspects to provide evidence at trial that they were not impaired.The AAA study recommended that laws relying on thresholds be tossed out and that other factors be used. Mr. Nelson said that, ideally, those would include the failure of a standard field sobriety test and the results of a drug assessment conducted by a trained specialist. That assessment would include a blood test to confirm whether cannabis (or any other drug) was present in the bloodstream.But Ms. Forman said that using blood tests to establish impairment, even on a partial basis as Mr. Nelson suggested, could result in arbitrary punishments.It would be equivalent to a test that shows that you had a glass of wine three nights prior, she said. It tells you nothing about whether the driver is safe now. If we have better tests in the future, then by all means we should use them, but right now those tests are not helpful.She said that two groups would be especially vulnerable to such tests: patients using medical marijuana to treat illnesses, who would have high levels of THC in their blood regardless of their sobriety; and blacks and Latinos, who commit traffic violations at similar rates to whites but are more likely to be cited for them, data show.Sam Kamin, a professor of marijuana law and policy at the University of Denver, also objected to the blood tests inclusion. He said that though it was meaningful to confirm that someone suspected of driving while high had THC in his or her blood, a jury might weigh that information too heavily in deciding whether that person was impaired.I think that the amount of THC in the bloodstream is a relevant factor; I just worry that its misleading, he said.Over a dozen states are considering legalizing marijuana in some form in 2016, but it is not clear how they would institute laws to prevent people from driving while high.Californias Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which proposes to legalize recreational marijuana, includes a provision for $15 million to be given to the California Highway Patrol over five years to develop protocols and best practices for determining when a person is driving while impaired, including from marijuana use.A similar act proposed in Massachusetts, where recreational marijuana is decriminalized but not legal, does not specify how impairment would be assessed.The AAA study echoes the recommendations of many experts who call for the improvement of technology to evaluate drivers saliva for cannabis use.Sean OConnor, the faculty director of the Cannabis Law and Policy Project at the University of Washington, said that there was promising research into detecting cannabis through saliva and other techniques, but that it was being stymied by the drugs legal classification as a Schedule 1 substance.We are hamstrung by the fact that you cant do legitimate scientific research unless you have a Schedule 1 license, he said.His argument underlines the difficulty for states trying to write coherent policy when the drug is still illegal under federal law. Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University who edits a blog on marijuana law, policy and reform, said that even our knowledge about the way people drive when high is confounded by the reality that marijuana was illegal when some of that data was collected.People had an extra reason to be cautious drivers when they were aware that they smelled like marijuana, he said. Now that its legal in some jurisdictions, absolutely that may affect not just the willingness of people to get behind the wheel after theyve smoked, but also how much theyll worry about getting pulled over."}
{"text": "The United States and Vietnam moved more quickly than most adversaries to rebuild a relationship after a devastating war. It took only two decades for the two countries to re-establish diplomatic ties after the Americans withdrew from Vietnam in 1973. President Obama plans to visit the country later this month.Mr. Obama should not feel obliged to give Vietnams authoritarian government what it wants  a complete lifting of the embargo on arms shipments imposed during the war, unless it takes credible steps toward addressing serious human rights abuses. Still, there are many points of agreement.Vietnam is central to Mr. Obamas strategy of focusing more attention on Asia and uniting the region economically, militarily and politically to counter an increasingly assertive China. Economic ties are growing stronger  the United States is now the largest importer of Vietnamese goods. Along with 11 other countries, Vietnam has joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which seeks to further expand regional trade while also improving labor and environmental standards.Later this year, Fulbright University Vietnam will open in Ho Chi Minh City, offering an American model of education that stresses academic independence and innovation. The two sides are cooperating on biodiversity research, and Washington is helping Vietnam cope with the environmental and health damage caused by Agent Orange over much of the southern part of the country.On the military front, the two countries agreed last year to conduct joint operations between their navies and cooperate in global peacekeeping. America has provided boats, training and equipment to Vietnams Coast Guard to fight transnational crime and counter Chinas efforts to control most of the South China Sea.Vietnam is pushing for a total repeal of the wartime arms embargo, which Mr. Obama eased in 2014, on grounds that it is an unnecessary relic and that lifting it would improve trust and allow the country to better defend itself. Advocates for lifting the ban say the move would send a strong signal to China. Given Hanois authoritarian ways, though, this is not the time to lift the ban completely. The Communist Party controls all institutions in Vietnam, permits no free elections, holds over 100 political prisoners and has yet to meet its obligations under the new trade agreement to allow labor unions.On a visit to Hanoi last month, Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the government to release all political prisoners and made clear that Vietnam needs to expand rights and freedoms if it hopes to build a culture of entrepreneurship and enhance economic growth. Mr. Obama should reinforce those themes.If he does lift the arms ban, Mr. Obama and Congress should move cautiously. Arms sales licenses should be decided on a case-by-case basis, of course, as they are with all countries. And, as Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont has advised, the government should weigh all factors, including whether Vietnam is willing to act to protect freedom of expression and other fundamental rights."}

A starlet of the stage might be arriving home after trying to hide from scandal; an opera singer or a tycoon might be putting into port after traveling the Continent. These qualified as notables in the age before reality TV. Ship registries posted their comings and goings.Photographers at the docks could expect not just a personage but also a show. In that era, it simply did not do to arrive at Americas great port in flip-flops and a San Diego Zoo sweatshirt. To voyage was to live out a national fantasy, making disembarking a public performance, worthy of choice raiment and the attendant scrutiny. She wore what?Most of the images here, taken from 1920 to 1934, ran in The Mid-Week Pictorial, a rotogravure magazine introduced by The New York Times in 1914 to show war pictures, then sold in 1936. Absent the visual urgency of the battlefield, the magazine was not above some celebrity swooning.Mary L. Baker (Slide 11) owed her fame to repeatedly leaving her wealthy fianc, Alister McCormick, waiting at the altar; William E. Pussyfoot Johnson (Slide 7) was known for his forceful campaigns for Prohibition, one of which incited an attack by a London mob that cost him an eye. That apparently did not dampen his spirits on his return to New York six months later. Or perhaps he had simply had a few on board. Did I ever drink? he once asked. Yes, gallons of it. Others, like the Austrian violinist Fritz Kreisler (Slide 1) with his wife, drew attention for their artistic accomplishments. Fred and Adele Astaire (Slide 13) and the actress Fay Marbe (Slide 6) knew how to strike a pose on returning from performances abroad, while Nol Coward and the set designer C. C. Cathrop (Slide 5), visiting from England to stage a revue called This Year of Grace, struck perhaps the most promising note by keeping their dry wit hidden and their hands to themselves. In a time before celebrities ruled the culture, even famous people sometimes behaved themselves.Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter. You can also find us on Facebook and Instagram."}
{"text": "OAKLAND, Calif.  Draymond Green, equal parts power forward and carnival barker, was annoyed with an officials call, which is something that happens with regularity whenever Green plays basketball for the Golden State Warriors. So he broke out one of his hallmark after-the-whistle moves, swinging his arms like an orchestra conductor.Greens theatrics are usually free of consequences, but this time he made accidental contact with the official, Ken Mauer, whose right hand paid the price for getting in the way. Both men had to seek emergency courtside treatment, a late subplot to Wednesdays game at Oracle Arena as the Warriors eliminated the Portland Trail Blazers from the N.B.A. playoffs.They were both bleeding, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said.Kerr could not have sounded less surprised about the episode. He might as well have been describing his breakfast. But he knows Green by now  all the drama, all the intrigue, all the extracurricular activities that fuel teammates, irritate opponents and occasionally injure referees.Its just what Draymond does, Kerr said. His mind works in an interesting way.The Warriors, of course, would not be nearly as dynamic without him. On a team full of basketball chemists (are those lab coats in their lockers?), Green wears an artists smock. Sure enough, he packed another postseason series full of layups, passes and postgame pledges, a diverse set of skills that ought to be known as the Draymond Special.He provides the edge that this team needs, said Kerr, whose team will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. Without Draymond, we would be in trouble. We would be too quiet and too nice.The Warriors needed just five games to get past the Trail Blazers in the conference semifinals, but it was a slog. The Warriors trailed at halftime in each of the final four games of the series. After injuries and ejections, Stephen Curry returned with his usual brand of sorcery to help nudge the Warriors one step closer to a second consecutive title.Through it all, though, there was Green, who guaranteed a victory after the Warriors lost Game 3 and then predicted that the Trail Blazers were done after Game 4. It was more than talk. Over the course of the series, Green averaged 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists. The Warriors outscored the Trail Blazers by 49 points when he was on the court.Just happy to be done with this series, said Green, who spoke highly of the Trail Blazers. I gained a lot of respect for those guys because of the way they fought.In addition to the Trail Blazers emergence and Currys brilliance, the series included an undercurrent of pseudo-psychology. Green was the primary practitioner.After the Warriors won Game 2, Green advised his teammates to keep quiet. Sensing that the Trail Blazers were already on the ropes, Green did not want to motivate them.So I told our team, Dont give them any bulletin-board material,  Green recalled. Everyone looked at me crazy, like What? Who is saying this? Because Im usually the guy to do that.Green realized that he had erred, he said, when the Trail Blazers won Game 3. The Warriors had come out soft, Green said, and he felt that it was his fault  his fault, he said, because he had told his teammates to clam up and their play had suffered. As he made his way to his postgame news conference, Green turned to Curry. Green was about to guarantee a win in Game 4.Im going to go into this news conference and give them all the bulletin-board material they need, Green recalled telling Curry. It wasnt no disrespect to them. It was more so at our guys, to make our guys respond to what Im saying. Not to say, Oh, we dont have any respect for the Blazers or They cant beat us. They proved they can beat us.Stuff like this comes as a mild source of amusement to his teammates and coaches. Kerr said he would not mind if Green chose to keep some things to himself. But it is not how he operates, and Kerr has come to accept the entire package. Kerr compared Green to the former baseball star Manny Ramirez, who was known for his  how to put this?  authenticity.Teammates turn to Green, a first-time All-Star selection this season, to rely on his playmaking and to borrow from his bottomless well of emotion. As for his mental warfare with the Trail Blazers?He had a really interesting explanation for why he was doing it, Kerr said. It was like reverse psychology or something. It doesnt mean anything. Everyone has to prepare and motivate themselves for the game, and hes our guy whos going to do a lot of talking. I dont think theres any damage done, and I dont think theres any offense taken, either.The season is long, so Green does what he can to ward off complacency and boredom  kryptonite for teams with championship aspirations.Last month, when Kerr accepted the N.B.A.s award for coach of the year, he went so far as to encourage Green to keep yelling at him. And last week, when Shaun Livingston, an otherwise mild-mannered point guard, was ejected from Game 4 against the Trail Blazers for screaming at an official, Green sounded like a doting parent.It was needed, Green said. It was fun to see.Green, who had been dealing with soreness in his left ankle, aggravated the injury in Game 5 against Portland. Afterward, he said he was grateful to have a semi-extended break before the start of the conference finals. But he also expressed confidence in his ability to push through any pain.If it happens again, just deal with it, he said.Curry said much the same about his tender right knee. Curry shared the postgame dais with Green, whose ensemble  black leather jacket, purple fedora  made it look as if he had arrived straight from the set of The Wild One. Green is aware that he and Curry might come off as an odd pairing.We carry ourselves a little different, Green said. But at the same time, its one of the reasons why hes one of my best friends, because we understand each other. We understand that competitiveness and doing whatever it takes to get to a certain level. It would surprise a lot of people, but it wouldnt surprise us."}

Names of the victims were not immediately available, and it was not clear if there were others inside the vehicle.The crash occurred at a private railroad crossing alongside a vineyard in Gregg, Calif. The crossing had signs but no gates, Ms. Graham said.Officer Josh McConnell of the California Highway Patrol said the trucks driver pulled around a stopped freight train at a crossing on a private dirt road and was struck by the Amtrak train traveling on another set of tracks, The Associated Press reported.The crash appeared to have happened, Officer McConnell said, because the freight train was blocking the main road and the trucks driver followed a dirt road parallel to the tracks to find a way around it.The locomotive involved in the crash sustained minor damage, Ms. Graham said."}
{"text": "Just how securely are banks moving money around the world?New details emerged on Friday about a pair of related attacks on banks that use the Swift message service, which allows financial firms and companies to transfer payments around the world.Computer security researchers briefed on the investigation into one of the attacks, on the Bangladesh Bank, raised several theories about the crime, including the possibility that groups from Pakistan and North Korea may have been spying on the bank. Other analysts investigating the attacks said there were striking similarities between the multiple bespoke tools used by the hackers in both the banking cases and the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014.The latest breach detailed by Swift in a letter to its users on Friday occurred at a commercial bank that appeared, according to a leading online security firm BAE Systems on Friday, to be located in Vietnam.That attack and the $81 million heist from the Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February are thought to be part of a broad assault on the global banking system by thieves whose operating methods and digital fingerprints are being studied carefully by analysts worldwide.In both attacks on banks, the intruders obtained legitimate credentials to sign in to the Swift network. They initiated fraudulent money transfers, then covered their tracks using tailor-made malware.Swift, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a global banking consortium that operates a secure and trusted network that sends payment instructions between banks across international borders. In the predictable finger-pointing that has followed the news of the attacks, Swift has pointed out that its core network was not hacked  just the end points at which the banks tap into it  and the New York Fed has reiterated that it followed all proper procedures.On Friday, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, released a statement calling on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to bolster its security even further.I remain concerned that there are critical security gaps in the international payment system, Ms. Maloney said in a statement.She also released correspondence between her office and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in which the banks general counsel, Thomas C. Baxter Jr., assured her that there is no evidence that any Federal Reserve systems were compromised.Investigators briefed on the investigation at the Bangladesh central bank say that they had uncovered the presence of three groups of intruders inside the banks systems: two nations  Pakistan and North Korea  and a third, unidentified group of digital criminals thought to have siphoned the funds from the bank to accounts in the Philippines.Also on Friday, two forensics investigators at BAE Systems outlined evidence that suggested similarities between the Bangladesh heist and a 2014 attack against Sony Pictures that law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States have traced to North Korea. That year, Sony released the farcical movie The Interview, which poked fun at North Korea.The investigators pointed to specialized, identical tools  including identical encryption keys, file names and a highly unusual data deletion technique  that were used in the attack on Sony Pictures, the Bangladesh central bank and the Vietnamese bank.However, people briefed on the actual investigation at the Bangladesh bank, who would speak only on the condition that they not be named, said that while the same tools were present inside Bangladeshs systems, suggesting any link between that heist and the North Korean hackers would be premature.Banks are frequent targets not just for profit-seeking digital criminals, but also nation states hoping to track spending by their perceived enemies or to gain insights into deal-making activity.In 2012, investigators at the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab revealed a campaign by nations, presumably the United States or Israel, aimed at banks in Lebanon, including the Bank of Beirut, Blom Bank, Byblos Bank and Credit Libanais, along with Citibank and PayPal.In that case, the organizations involved in the Lebanese bank intrusions never stole any funds. Rather, they used stolen credentials to track customers assets and spending.By their nature, hackers are difficult to trace, and theories advanced immediately after a breach can turn out to be wrong.In summer 2014, when hackers stole account information from tens of millions of customers at JPMorgan Chase, experts initially pointed to Russia, raising concerns about national security.In the end, federal prosecutors said that attack might have been partly the work of Israeli nationals and individuals who knew each other from Florida State University, and that their attack on the bank may have been aimed at advancing a pump-and-dump stock scheme. No money was stolen from JPMorgan in that breach.Large banks in the United States and Europe, which are part owners of Swift, have been monitoring the developments and are studying whether they need to adjust any of their defenses to guard against similar intrusions.We are pretty fast learners, said Doug Johnson, senior vice president for payments and security at the American Bankers Association, a trade group. We proactively share information about how to mitigate these threats.In the heist at Bangladesh Bank, the thieves used the stolen credentials to authorize the transfer of $951 million from the central banks account at the New York Fed.The Fed approved five of the payments to accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. As far as the bank employees in the United States could tell, the payment requests had been authenticated by Swift.One of those five requests was ultimately blocked by a bank in Sri Lanka, which noticed that the name of the supposed nonprofit group that was to receive the funds was misspelled. Instead of Foundation, it was spelled Fundation, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a continuing criminal investigation.The New York officials relied entirely on Swift to authenticate the transfers, according to a letter from the New York Fed that Ms. Maloneys office released on Friday. It does not independently vet other users on the Swift network.The New York Fed withheld an additional 30 requested transfers from Bangladesh because one address that was supposed to receive a payment contained the same name as a ship known for smuggling activity, the person briefed on the matter said.It turned out the address and the smuggling ship were unrelated, but that was enough to raise the New York Feds concerns. When they couldnt reconfirm with officials in Bangladesh that transfers were legitimate, the New York bank denied them."}
{"text": "The act of voting can be shamefully difficult in this country amid the crazy quilt of often-dysfunctional systems employed by the states and thousands of localities. The discouraging fact is, citizens in 17 states will find new voting restrictions in place this year  obstacles that include stringent photo ID requirements, limits on early voting and unjust hurdles in the registration process.That is all the more reason to celebrate the positive, pro-voter measures quietly enacted in some states, most notably an electronic system of registering voters automatically when they visit motor vehicle departments. In the past 14 months, four states  Oregon, California, West Virginia and Vermont  have voted to put this innovative system in place, while 28 other states and the District of Columbia have been considering the idea, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.The best selling point for this breakthrough comes from Oregon, the pioneer in motor-voter registration, where the number of new voters has surged. This year, an average of 15,375 voters a month have joined the rolls after being automatically added, with the option to decline, at the motor vehicle office. Under the old system, in which people had to initiate the process, the monthly average was 3,955 in 2014 and 4,163 in 2012.Any politician worth his oath of office should be embracing this system, with its promise of a healthy increase in voter participation. But Republican strategists continue their push to suppress voting (knowing that bigger voter turnouts tend to favor the Democrats), citing the repeatedly disproved claim of widespread voter fraud.This was the canard offered by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in November when he vetoed automatic voter registration during his eventually disastrous run for the Republican presidential nomination. (Mr. Christie might have found the law useful in his role as an acolyte of Donald Trump, whose supporters include many freshly minted voters.)Officials in Vermont estimate that their new system could add as many as 50,000 voters in the next four years. California officials, not sure whether their system will be working in time for this years election, estimate that there are 6.6 million eligible voters now unregistered, with many due for license renewals.The general trend in state legislatures has been toward bills that would expand voting access, rather than curtail it, according to a Brennan Center analysis. Thats a positive sign for the future, but not for this years tooth-and-claw campaign, in which voter suppression is a reality that mars the very idea of democracy."}

{"text": "There will be no contested convention this year. But that doesnt mean it wont get contentious.And while there is little doubt that Donald J. Trump will emerge from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland as the partys presidential nominee, there is still some uncertainty about what could unfold there starting July 18.Over the course of four days, Mr. Trump will have to navigate potential hazards, like hostile delegates suspicious of his conservatism and determined to thwart his candidacy. Complicating matters further, many of those delegates possess an intricate knowledge of the parliamentary process that establishes the conventions rules and program. Any of them looking to make trouble certainly could try.Recent political conventions have grown so scripted and choreographed that moments of true spontaneity are rare. This year, when history seems to be providing little guiding precedent, could be the one that shatters the calm. Here are some of the wild cards that could roil the event in Cleveland:Convention delegates are under no obligation to vote for the vice-presidential candidate Mr. Trump chooses. That vote is held separately, and if enough delegates object to Mr. Trumps choice for any reason  too liberal, too moderate, too inexperienced, too much of an insider  they can vote the nomination down.Some conservatives have demanded that Mr. Trump name his vice-presidential contender well before the convention, a position that appears to be more than just the usual griping. Many delegates suspect Mr. Trump is not a sincere conservative, and they want to be reassured by having him choose a running mate they trust.Tensions among party factions could surface through the process of assembling the partys platform, the document that spells out its policy positions. In a contentious convention it is easy to envision a scenario in which conservatives look to insert new language to take a hard line on issues that Mr. Trump has not made central to his campaign.This could come in the form of a plank on transgender rights and the use of bathrooms, currently a touchy issue with social conservatives. Mr. Trump has said he thinks it is unnecessary to pass laws that restrict bathroom use by people who identify with a gender different from their gender at birth. Social conservatives who oppose him could push for language saying such laws are needed to protect children.And Mr. Trump could try to make things uncomfortable given how many of his views run contrary to Republican orthodoxy. He could, for example, insist that the platform include language that disavows the trade deals he loathes, something that is sure to rankle free-trade Republicans but stir passions among Mr. Trumps supporters.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has a large and loyal following that will be eager to hear from him on the partys biggest stage. He gets to deliver a speech no matter what, but it is up to Mr. Trump to decide whether that happens in prime time or in the lonely viewing hours of afternoon.Typically the runner-up will bargain with the presumptive nominee when it comes to such issues. In exchange for releasing his delegates to vote for Mr. Trump  something Mr. Cruz has pointedly not done  Mr. Trump could agree to give Mr. Cruz a marquee billing at the convention.Mr. Cruz could always stubbornly hold onto his nearly 600 delegates. And most of them would probably have to vote for him at the convention under the partys binding rules. That would amount to an embarrassing affront to Mr. Trump and make him the first Republican nominee in recent times to suffer such significant defections in the nominating vote.Mr. Trumps challenge in running a convention with hostile delegates is like nothing we have seen in recent election cycles, when about as rowdy as it got was in 2012 when a relatively small number of Ron Paul delegates revolted.Mr. Cruz probably wants more than just a speech, as he hinted this week by urging his delegates to push the party platform in a more conservative direction. His cooperation, and the Trump campaigns willingness to negotiate, will set the conventions tone.So far, the Trump campaign seems to understand the value in having a convention as unified as possible. Paul Manafort, a senior Trump adviser who was brought on to run delegate and convention outreach, was at the Republican convention in 1976 when President Gerald R. Ford faced a challenge from Ronald Reagan. Then a staff member for Mr. Ford, Mr. Manafort said he had drawn some lessons on how not to treat the runner-up.The Ford campaign didnt handle Reagan right in 76 because it didnt make him feel important, Mr. Manafort said. As a consequence the campaign lost the value of Reagan for a month and a half.And there could be value for Mr. Trump in having Mr. Cruz on board to rally conservative voters when he faces the general election.The convention is essentially a living body, with rules and procedures that can be modified or discarded to suit the desires of the delegates. This is where much of the speculation about an unruly convention began.Anything dramatic seems unlikely  a move by delegates hostile to Mr. Trump, for example, to change the rules to deny him the nomination  but it is possible. Consider this potential nuclear option, which one rules expert described anonymously because it is only hypothetical. It is tantalizing because it is so simple.Mr. Trump could be stopped with just a single-word change requiring the nominee to receive a supermajority of votes at the convention rather than the majority currently required. Mr. Trump, after all, had floated changing majority to plurality when it was not clear he would win the 1,237 delegates he needed.Other changes could also create mayhem. One delegate who is a rules expert, Curly Haugland of North Dakota, said in an interview that he will propose a new rule that would allow any candidate with one delegate to be entered into nomination. This would open the door for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and others to be nominated. (Right now, only Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz will be formally entered because the rules essentially require candidates to win at least eight states before they can be nominated.)More names in nomination mean fewer votes for Mr. Trump, and the remote possibility that he could be denied the majority he needs to prevent a second ballot. And after that, as unlikely as it seems now, all bets would be off."}
{"text": "The most spectacular save of the Stanley Cup playoffs so far was probably made by Washington Capitals forward Jay Beagle, who lunged into a vacated crease to swat away a shot by Pittsburgh defenseman Trevor Daley with the shaft of his stick.Beagle was credited merely with a blocked shot at 2 minutes 48 seconds of overtime Tuesday in Game 6 of the teams second-round series, and the Penguins eliminated the Capitals less than four minutes later, anyway, when Nick Bonino scored on a rebound.But Beagles dive kept Washingtons season alive just a little longer, and it was yet another example of how slim the margins are between victory and defeat for N.H.L. teams chasing the Stanley Cup.To get to that overtime, the Capitals had rallied from a two-goal deficit in the third period, scoring the tying goal on a 5-on-3 power play after Pittsburgh was called for three delay-of-game penalties in 122 seconds for hurriedly sending the puck over the glass.Teams make it to the playoffs by being able to take leads and protect them. The 16 teams that led the league in most victories when scoring first in the regular season were the same 16 teams that made the playoffs.Of the best 16 teams at holding the lead after the second period in the regular season, 14 qualified for the playoffs. (Boston and Calgary were the exceptions.) But it is harder to hang onto leads in the playoffs, because opponents are better and there is much more on the line.The salary cap has promoted parity; so has advanced scouting, said Mike Milbury, the former Boston Bruins defenseman and Islanders general manager, who is now a hockey analyst for NBC. The battle level rises significantly in the playoffs, as does pre-scouting. Individual and team tendencies are noted, and strategies to thwart them are implemented.For teams that take leads into the third period of a regular-season game, victory is all but assured. This season, teams that led going into the third period compiled a record of 804-61-78, a winning percentage of .853, according to N.H.L. figures. Teams that trailed after two periods were just 139-716-88.But during the first two rounds of the playoffs, teams that took a lead into the third period were 47-25, a much lower winning percentage of .653. About 29 percent of games (21 of 72) were tied after two periods, compared with 23.3 percent of regular-season games (287 of 1,230).The first goal of a game still has value in the playoffs: Teams that scored first were 47-25 (.653) in the first two rounds. But that is a lower success rate than in the regular season, when teams that scored first were 853-251-126, a winning percentage of .694.Over all, playoff games this year are headed to overtime at the same rate as regular-season games. Through two playoff rounds, 16 of 72 games, 22.2 percent, were decided in overtime, compared with 275 of 1,230 regular-season games, 22.3 percent.But according to the N.H.L., the nine overtime games in the second round were the most in that round since the 16-team format was introduced in 1980.In addition, there was not a sweep in 12 series in the first two rounds  the first time that has happened since 2010. (There were three sweeps in the first two rounds in 2011; two sweeps last year; and one each in 2011, 2012 and 2013.)Perhaps no team this postseason was more aware of the precariousness of a third-period lead than the Islanders. They eliminated the Panthers in the first round by overcoming a third-period deficit in the final minute of regulation and winning in the second overtime. They led only two of their five playoff victories after two periods.But the Islanders never seemed to recover from blowing two one-goal leads in the third period of Game 3 of the second round against the Lightning, which the Islanders lost in overtime. They entered the third period of Game 4 with a one-goal lead and again lost in overtime.Then there was the first-round playoff game on April 24 between the Dallas Stars and the host Minnesota Wild. The Stars scored the first goal less than six minutes in, then pumped in three more before the end of the second period to pad their lead to 4-0.With the Wild facing elimination, though, the game went haywire. Minnesota scored three third-period goals, then another after Dallas made it 5-3. The Wild pulled their goalie for an extra attacker in the final two minutes, and the Stars held on for a 5-4 victory.It was hardly the desired result in Minnesota, of course, and Dallas had followed form by winning after scoring first and leading after two periods. But the third period was unforgettable, and it probably will not be the last hair-raising finish of the spring."}
{"text": "BRASLIA  One of Brazils longest-running spectacles features a dizzying array of characters whose theatrics appear on millions of television sets most nights.The ever-changing cast of 594 includes suspects accused of murder and drug trafficking, aging former soccer players, a judo champion, a country music star and a collection of bearded men who have adopted roles as leaders of a womens movement.The cast even includes a clown who goes by the name Grumpy.But these are not actors. They are the men and women who serve in the national legislature.Democracy can be a mystifying, rough-and-tumble affair anywhere, but Brazils Congress has few equals.As the nation endures its worst political upheaval in a generation, the lawmakers  orchestrating the ouster of President Dilma Rousseff  who was suspended on Thursday and faces an impeachment trial on charges of manipulating the budget  are coming under renewed scrutiny.More than half of the members of Congress face legal challenges, from cases in auditing court involving public contracts to serious counts like kidnapping or murder, according to Transparency Brazil, a corruption monitoring group.The figures under investigation include the president of the Senate and the new speaker of the lower house. Just this month, the previous speaker, an evangelical Christian radio commentator fond of posting biblical verse on Twitter, was ejected to face trial on charges that he secreted as much as $40 million in bribes into Swiss bank accounts.Many of the legislatures problems stem from the generous rewards to be found in Brazils hydra-headed party system, an unwieldy collection of dozens of political organizations whose names and agendas often leave Brazilians scratching their heads.There is the Party of the Brazilian Woman, for instance  a group whose elected members in Congress are all men.The electoral process allows many distortions, said Sud Haidar, the partys founder and president. She sighed, acknowledging that many of the men who join have little interest in promoting womens rights.One of those who joined the party, Senator Hlio Jos da Silva Lima, was accused of sexually abusing a young niece last year, though charges were later dropped. What would become of us men if there were no women by our side, to bring us joy and pleasure? he was quoted as saying in the Brazilian news media when asked about his decision to join the womens party.The same public fury over endemic corruption and governmental mismanagement that helped drive Ms. Rousseff from power has long been directed at the cabal of politicians, most of them white men, whose penchant for back-room deals and self-enrichment has become part of Brazilian lore.The reputation of the political class in Brazil really cant go any lower, said Timothy J. Power, a professor of Brazilian studies at Oxford University.People compare the legislature to the House of Cards, he said, referring to the Netflix political drama, but I disagree. House of Cards is actually more believable.With 28 parties holding seats, the Brazilian Congress is the worlds most fractured, according to Mr. Power. The runner-up, Indonesias legislature, has a third fewer parties.Brazil is not an outlier, its a freak, said Gregory Michener, the director of the public transparency program at Fundao Getlio Vargas, a university in Rio de Janeiro.The parties tend to use words like Democratic, Christian and Republican in their names, though Labor has them all beat. Among them are the Labor Party of Brazil, the Christian Labor Party, the Brazilian Labor Renewal Party and the National Labor Party. For the sake of variety, there are also the Workers Cause Party and Ms. Rousseffs once-dominant Workers Party.The entire system is a monster, said Juremir Machado da Silva, a columnist at Correio do Povo, a newspaper in the southern city of Prto Alegre.Polling has shown that more than 70 percent of Brazilians cannot recall what parties the candidates they elect belong to, and that two-thirds of the electorate has no preference for any party.More important, experts say, is that most of the parties embrace no ideology or agenda and are simply vehicles for patronage and graft. In a typical four-year term, one in three federal legislators will switch parties, some more than once, according to a tally by Marcus Andr Melo, a political scientist at the Federal University of Pernambuco.Brazilian lawmakers are among the worlds highest paid, scholars say, with generous stipends that go well beyond their monthly salaries. They also receive free housing, health care and large staffs and enjoy special immunity from prosecution. Only the overworked Supreme Court can try them on criminal charges, a process that can take years.The only thing thats better than being a political party in Brazil is to be a church, said Heni Ozi Cukier, a political scientist at the university E.S.P.M. in So Paulo. Theyre opportunists who are looking for something that gives them power, influence, protection.Forming a party requires collecting 500,000 signatures. Mr. Cukier said 62 parties were seeking official recognition, including one named after a soccer team.Although Brazils president leads one of the worlds largest countries, he or she must forge coalitions with up to a dozen parties to get legislation passed in Congress. The price of loyalty is often a ministerial post, or three, depending on how many votes the party can deliver.In some instances, cooperation involves the illicit exchange of cash. In 2005, a scandal known as mensalo, or big monthly payment, revealed the pervasiveness of such arrangements. To win votes in Congress, the party of President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseffs mentor and the standard-bearer of the Workers Party, had been paying compliant lawmakers a monthly stipend of $12,000.The most recent graft scandal  known as Operao Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash  has proved even bigger, with billions of dollars in bribes directed to political parties from the national oil company, Petrobras. More than 200 people, from business tycoons to party leaders, have been implicated in the scandal, and their numbers are expected to grow.Public fury over the scheme played a pivotal role in the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, who was chairwoman of Petrobras when the kickback arrangement was hatched, though she has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In her impeachment trial, she is accused of a budgetary sleight of hand in an effort to conceal Brazils economic troubles and win re-election in 2014  not of stealing to enrich herself.The need to form alliances of convenience in Congress can lead to legislative chaos, especially when disgruntled partners bolt from the presidents coalition. Ms. Rousseff, who once enjoyed a wide majority in the lower house, was ultimately knocked aside by the houses now deposed speaker, Eduardo Cunha, a onetime ally who faces a graft trial.Mr. Cunhas party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, called the P.M.D.B., has become a particular source of outrage in Brazil. Critics say the party, founded five decades ago as an opposition party but tolerated by the nations military dictatorship, has become a vast patronage trough for its members, who embrace a wide spectrum of ideologies.The partys ace is its size, which means that presidents have to enter into a partnership that involves doling out coveted cabinet posts. Ms. Rousseff chose Michel Temer of the P.M.D.B. to be her vice president. This year, he turned against her and withdrew his party from her coalition, paving the way for Ms. Rousseffs impeachment trial. Mr. Temer, who has been convicted of violating campaign finance limits, is now the nations president.Political reform can be challenging, given that legislators must approve undoing the system that protects them. There have been some changes, including a recent law that bars candidates with criminal records from running for office for eight years, and a campaign finance law, scheduled to take effect this year, that limits the influence of corporate money.The crush of Brazilian parties tends to favor celebrity candidates, whose name recognition helps vault them to the top of the ballot heap during elections. The most curious example is Tiririca the Clown, whose stage name translates as Grumpy.In 2010, he ran for the lower house on a lark with the slogan It cant get any worse, and his campaign literature included this tagline: What does a congressman do? The truth is I dont know, but vote for me and Ill tell you.He prevailed with more than 1.3 million votes  nearly twice as many as the next candidate.In an interview, Tiririca  whose real name is Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, though Deputy Tiririca is the name on the house website  said he was often disappointed by the disarray in Congress.At first it was a joke, he said of his candidacy. So I decided that if so many people believe in me, I would have to give it my best, and thats what Im doing."}
{"text": "Officials in Georgia have decided not to file charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy who pulled a gun from his fathers backpack and fatally shot himself in the chest in April.The boy, Holston Cole, was one of four young children who died from accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wounds during a one-week span in April. According to a statement released by the Paulding County Sheriffs Office on Thursday, sheriffs detectives and the county district attorneys office decided not to move forward with charges, saying the evidence suggested that the shooting was not intentional.Detectives confirmed that this was an accidental shooting and that charges will not be pursued, the statement said.The deaths of the four children in one week encapsulated how cases like these can be handled differently from state to state, and depending on the details of each case: After ShaQuille Kornegay, a 2-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., shot and killed herself with a gun her father often kept under his pillow, the authorities charged her father, Courtenay Block, with second-degree murder and child endangerment. In Natchitoches, La., after 3-year-old Zaveon Amari Williams shot himself in the head, Alverious Demars, 22, a companion of the boys mother, was charged with negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. The weapon has not been recovered. In Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton, the mother of 2-year-old Kiyan Shelton, was charged Tuesday with a felony count of neglect after her son shot himself in the chest with a gun he found in her purse, the Indianapolis Star reported.In Holstons case, officials had previously suggested that Mr. Cole would not face serious charges for the death.Anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels, Sgt. Ashley Henson, a spokesman for the sheriffs office, said in April.According to a redacted recording, Holstons father, David, could be heard on the 911 call yelling No, no! as he fought to keep his son alive."}
{"text": "The casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson told Donald J. Trump in a private meeting last week that he was willing to contribute more to help elect him than he has to any previous campaign, a sum that could exceed $100 million, according to two Republicans with direct knowledge of Mr. Adelsons commitment.As significant, Mr. Adelson, a billionaire based in Las Vegas, has decided that he will significantly scale back his giving to congressional Republicans and direct most of his contributions to groups dedicated to Mr. Trumps campaign. The two Republicans familiar with Mr. Adelsons plans spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Mr. Adelsons pledge to Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, comes at an opportune time. Mr. Trump has relied on a mix of his own wealth and small-dollar contributions to finance his primary effort and lacks the sort of major donor network needed to sustain him in the general election. Mr. Trump has said that he may need $1 billion for the campaign but has only recently begun scheduling fund-raisers and hiring finance staff members. Many of the Republican Partys wealthiest contributors, including the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, have indicated they are unlikely to give to his candidacy.What remains unclear is how Mr. Adelson plans to contribute his money to Mr. Trump. He will give the maximum allowed to Mr. Trumps campaign and the Republican National Committee, but to spend the amount he contemplates would require donating through a super PAC, able to accept unlimited donations.According to the Republicans familiar with Mr. Adelsons planning, he and his advisers are still uncertain about which super PAC to use as their vehicle for the bulk of the contributions. They are wary of some of the current groups that purportedly exist to help Mr. Trump, who has been clear that he is uneasy with outside entities promoting his candidacy. At rallies, he has consistently criticized opponents who relied on super PACS, saying they were being bought by wealthy donors.Mr. Adelson, 82, the chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, is among the worlds wealthiest individuals and has given hundreds of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes over the years. In 2012, he contributed at least $98 million to Republican efforts, according to a study by ProPublica. But that money went to 34 separate campaigns and groups.Mr. Adelson is frustrated by congressional gridlock and believes the only way to affect the countrys political system is to ensure a Republican president is elected, say the Republicans familiar with his thinking.While he may help some local or gubernatorial candidates, he is not planning to give much to congressional candidates or super PACs dedicated to keeping Republican control of the House and Senate, a substantial blow given the largess he has showered on them in recent elections.Mr. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, met with Mr. Trump and his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at the St. Regis Hotel in Midtown Manhattan while Mr. Adelson was in town for a gala dinner to benefit the World Values Network, an organization dedicated to disseminating Jewish values in politics, culture and media. The two moguls, who do not know each other well, had met earlier in the campaign.But their conversation last week marked the first time they had talked in person since Mr. Trump effectively won the nomination this month.Mr. Trump assured the Adelsons that he was dedicated to protecting Israels security, an issue about which the couple are passionate.The Adelsons contributed to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during the Republican primaries, but kept a far lower profile than they had in 2012, when Mr. Adelson was a major benefactor of Newt Gingrich. Mr. Trump targeted Mr. Adelson on Twitter in October, writing that Mr. Adelson wanted to make Senator Marco Rubio of Florida his perfect little puppet.But Mr. Adelson was plainly not bothered  or he at least forgave Mr. Trump. He told reporters last week he would get behind Mr. Trump and wrote an op-ed article in Fridays Washington Post extolling his fellow casino owner.He is a candidate with actual CEO experience, shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the publics, Mr. Adelson wrote, adding that Mr. Trump has created a movement in this country that cannot be denied."}
{"text": "The Yankees season thus far has mimicked a game of Jenga. For every piece inserted to stabilize a rickety roster, another is pulled out just as quickly, creating more imbalance.The clubs best hope for creating a core to build around emanates from the bullpen, which was buttressed on Monday when Aroldis Chapman returned from a 29-game suspension imposed under baseballs new policy on domestic violence.On Saturday, for the first time this season, Manager Joe Girardi was able to insert Chapman, the former closer Andrew Miller and the elite reliever Dellin Betances into the final innings of a game. The moves worked seamlessly, helping the Yankees secure a 2-1 win over the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium.The three pitchers combined for three and one-third scoreless innings, allowing only one hit while accumulating eight of their 10 combined outs by strikeout. Betances struck out all four batters he faced.Starter Ivan Nova was also sturdy, allowing four hits before Betances replaced him with two outs in the sixth. Novas only noticeable blemish was a home run by Todd Frazier in the fourth inning.I feel comfortable with all the guys that we have, but those three guys especially, theyre strikeout machines, Nova said. Once you throw six good innings, you can kind of relax and know theyre going to get the job done.The bottom of the Yankees order strung together a two-out rally in the second to score two runs, with Aaron Hicks and Didi Gregorius each driving in a run. Gregorius went 3 for 3 against Jose Quintana (5-2), whose earned run average went to 1.54 after he entered the day leading the American League at 1.38.The bullpens dazzling performance was a refreshing bracer on a day when the Yankees roster was again shuffled, largely as a result of the mild right triceps strain that sent starting pitcher Luis Severino to the 15-day disabled list after his loss on Friday night.Chad Green and Conor Mullee arrived together in the Yankees clubhouse at 10 a.m., both having signed major league contracts after being promoted from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.To make room, Gary Sanchez, who was recalled Friday, was optioned back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The Yankees also transferred Bryan Mitchell and Greg Bird to the 60-day disabled list.Two hours later, the Yankees announced that they had acquired the right-handed pitcher J. R. Graham from the Minnesota Twins for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Graham was optioned to Class AA Trenton, and Mason Williams was transferred to the 60-day D.L.Green could temporarily replace Severino in the rotation. General Manager Brian Cashman also mentioned Luis Cessa as a candidate to start.Severino, speaking with members of the news media on Saturday for the first time since the injury, said he felt a little sore but did not think the injury was serious. He added that he felt a pinch in his arm during the second inning Friday but did not think it was serious enough to reveal. Girardi, however, noticed Severinos discomfort the next inning during an at-bat by Jose Abreu and removed him from the game.Cashman and Girardi said they did not think Severino was struggling because of any physical problems, noting that his command and inability to properly locate strikes had been the leading causes of his 0-6 start and 7.46 E.R.A. Cashman said Severino would probably make a rehab start before coming off the disabled list, but Cashman did not guarantee that Severino would remain in the Yankees rotation.Well have to wait and see, Cashman said, adding: Hes not pitching anywhere close to his capabilities. So the most important thing is to try and get him going. Thats a decision well have to make for another day.The Yankees are still without Alex Rodriguez, and his absence was notable on Saturday  Alex Rodriguez bat day at Yankee Stadium. Instead of taking his own swings, Rodriguez handed out replicas of his black bat from behind a barrier to young fans. Rodriguez made no predictions on when he would return to the lineup.While Rodriguez remains on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring, another team pillar, Jacoby Ellsbury, got into a game for the first time since May 6, coming on as a defensive replacement in center field in the eighth inning.But Ellsbury barely tested his strained right hip, because Miller recorded two strikeouts in a scoreless inning and Chapman also struck out two in a flawless ninth.Catcher Brian McCann said there was no doubt that the back end of the Yankees bullpen could seep into opponents heads and change their batting approaches.Speaking through an interpreter, Chapman said: We were ready to take on this kind of work. This is the outcome that we expect to have. Its a really nice combination between Dellin, Miller and me, and the other guys in the bullpen.Chapman added, Its a good formula that we have going on."}
{"text": "While Ronda Rousey was dominating the Ultimate Fighting Championship and being heralded as one of the worlds best athletes, a handful of naysayers maintained that someone else was actually the best fighter in womens mixed martial arts.On Saturday, that woman, Cristiane Justino, known as Cyborg, will finally make her U.F.C. debut.Justino, a 30-year-old Brazilian, has dominated opponent after opponent, winning titles in the Strikeforce and Invicta promotions. Like Rousey, she has won many of her fights in a matter of seconds. Unlike Rousey, whose specialty is the armbar, Justino tends to send opponents to the canvas with a devastating knockout punch.But she has never fought in the U.F.C., largely because of weight class issues. Justino fights at 145 pounds, while the U.F.C.s heaviest weight class for women, in which Rousey fights, is 135 pounds. Justino, who is 5 feet 8 inches, has been reluctant to cut weight to get to that level.Fighting in different promotions did not stop Rousey and Justino from engaging in a long-running war of words. Justino called Rousey and U.F.C. officials bullies, while Rousey ripped Justino for testing positive for steroids after a fight in 2011.Cyborgs arrival in the U.F.C. comes as the womens division is in some disarray. First, the unbeatable Rousey lost to Holly Holm in  November. Then Holm turned around and lost in March to Miesha Tate, who has lost to Rousey twice.None of the big names are set to fight each other soon. In July, Tate will defend her title against Amanda Nunes, and Holm will fight Valentina Shevchenko.Regardless of who the champion is, Rousey remains the biggest name in womens mixed martial arts. Her return has been delayed by the filming of a movie, Road House, but there is talk she will return in November at the first U.F.C. card in New York, where the sport has been legalized.Justinos debut on Saturday, in Curitiba, Brazil, will be contested at a special weight, 140 pounds. She will be a huge favorite over Leslie Smith, who is only 2-2 in the U.F.C. and 8-6-1 over all.I know that Cyborg has overwhelmed most of her opponents, Smith said in a U.F.C. video. I know that she has a lot of power and I know that she gets wild.I think that I have the intelligence and the skills to work outside of her plan.Assuming Justino routs Smith, what is next for her? Will the U.F.C. start a new, heavier division for her to fight in? Or will she have no choice but to cut weight to fight Rousey or the other big names at 135? The long-term plans for Cyborg have not been determined yet, Lenee Breckenridge, a U.F.C. spokeswoman, said.For her part, Justino seems ready to take the U.F.C. by storm. Im really happy, its a great opportunity, she said. I can fight any girl: Holly Holm, Miesha, Ronda, anyone.Should she eventually get into the Octagon against Rousey, it would very likely be the most anticipated womens fight in history.The huge interest in Cyborgs debut is bringing almost as much attention as the main event on Saturday, a mens heavyweight title fight. The champion Fabrcio Werdum, a submission specialist, will face the hard-hitting Stipe Miocic, who comes off an impressive first-minute knockout of Andrei Arlovski."}
{"text": "IN 1903, New Yorkers executed an elephant on Coney Island, effectively torturing her to death.Accounts vary a bit, but it seems Topsy was a circus elephant who had been abused for years and then killed a man who had burned her on the trunk with a cigar. After her owners had no more use for her, Topsy was fed cyanide, electrocuted and then strangled with a winch. The Edison motion picture company made a film of it, Electrocuting an Elephant.So maybe there is an arc of moral progress. After many allegations of mistreatment of animals, Ringling Brothers this month retired its circus elephants, sending them off to a life of leisure in Florida. SeaWorld said this spring that it would stop breeding orcas and would invest millions of dollars in rescuing and rehabilitating marine animals.Meanwhile, Walmart responded to concerns for animal welfare by saying last month that it would shift toward cage-free eggs, following similar announcements by Costco, Dennys, Wendys, Safeway, Starbucks and McDonalds in the U.S. and Canada.This is a humane revolution, and Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, has been at the forefront of it. Alternately bullying companies to do better and cooperating with those that do so, he outlines his approach in an excellent new book, The Humane Economy. These corporate changes have vast impact: Walmart or McDonalds shapes the living conditions of more animals in a day than an animal shelter does in a decade.There is also a lesson, I think, for many other causes, from the environment to womens empowerment to global health: The best way for nonprofits to get large-scale results is sometimes to work with corporations to change behavior and supply lines  while whacking them when they resist.The Environmental Defense Fund and Conservation International do something similar in the environmental space, CARE works with corporations to fight global poverty, and the Human Rights Campaign partners with companies on L.G.B.T. issues.Critics sometimes see this as moral compromise, negotiating with evil rather than defeating it; I see it as pragmatism. Likewise, Pacelle has been a vegan for 31 years but cooperates with fast-food companies to improve conditions in which animals are raised for meat.Animals jammed into cages and crates cannot wait for the world to go vegan, Pacelle told me. Im quite sure they want out of this unyielding life of privation right now, and once that question is settled, then sensible people can debate whether they should be raised for the plate at all.At a time when the world is a mess, Pacelle outlines a hopeful vision. The public has always had some impact with charitable donations, and there have always been occasional boycotts, but sometimes its greatest influence comes by leveraging daily consumer purchasing power.As the humane economy asserts its own power, its own logic and its essential decency, an older order is passing away, Pacelle writes in his book. By every measure, life will be better when human satisfaction and need are no longer built upon the foundation of animal cruelty. Indefensible practices will no longer need defending.Its true that atrocities continue and that the slaughter of animals like elephants persists. There were some 130,000 elephants in Sudan 25 years ago, while now there may be only 5,000 in Sudan and the country that broke off from it, South Sudan, Pacelle writes.Yet there is a business model for keeping grand animals like elephants alive. One analysis suggests that a dead elephants tusks are worth $21,000, while the tourism value of a single living elephant over its lifetime is $1.6 million. Countries follow their enlightened self-interest when they protect elephants, just as McDonalds pursues its self-interest when it shifts toward cage-free eggs.Its also astonishing how sensitive companies are becoming to public opinion about animals. After Cecil the lion was shot dead in Zimbabwe, animal protection groups lobbied airlines to ban the shipment of such trophies. Delta, American, United, Air Canada and other companies promptly obliged.In the pet store business, two chains  PetSmart and Petco  have prospered without accepting the industrys norm of selling dogs and cats from puppy mills and other mass breeders. Instead, since the 1990s they have made space available to rescue groups offering animals for adoption. PetSmart and Petco dont make money off these adoptions, but they win customer loyalty forever, and they have helped transfer 11 million dogs and cats to new homes.I believe that mistreatment of animals, particularly in agriculture, remains a moral blind spot for us humans, yet its heartening to see the consumer-driven revolution that is underway.Just about every enterprise built on harming animals today is ripe for disruption, Pacelle writes. In a world of grim tidings, thats a welcome reminder that there is progress as well. Weve gone in a bit more than a century from making a movie about torturing an elephant to sending circus elephants off to a Florida retirement home. But, boy, theres so much more work to do."}
{"text": "They called him a madman, a con man, a cancer and worse during an ugly nominating fight, but in the week since Donald J. Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, many of his former rivals and members of the partys establishment are already softening on him.Hard feelings are often short-lived in presidential politics, but the personal nature of this years race raised fears that unity would be hard to achieve. While a battered former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and a bruised Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are still keeping their distance from Mr. Trump, the recent outreach among others who assailed him for months has been swift and striking.Perhaps the starkest example of this was Senator Lindsey Graham, whose personal cellphone number was read aloud publicly by Mr. Trump last year in a prank that set the schoolyard tone of the campaign. The Republican from South Carolina has regularly called Mr. Trump the most unprepared person Ive ever met to be commander in chief, and he once likened backing Mr. Trump to being shot.It appeared to be just a flesh wound, however, as the two men put their differences aside this week and spoke by telephone to discuss national security policy. Calling their 15-minute conversation cordial, Mr. Graham offered rare praise for Mr. Trump.Hes got a great sense of humor, Mr. Graham, who is still withholding his endorsement, told reporters on Thursday. He obviously can take a punch.The quickest ex-rival to embrace Mr. Trump was Rick Perry, who less than a year ago took to the microphone at a forum in Washington and declared that Mr. Trump must be stopped. Let no one be mistaken  Donald Trumps candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded, he said.Now the former Texas governor has endorsed Mr. Trump and went as far as saying he was ready to serve as a running mate if called upon. He is not a perfect man, Mr. Perry told CNN after Mr. Trumps remaining rivals dropped out. But what I do believe is that he loves this country and he will surround himself with capable, experienced people, and he will listen to them.Former Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana was among the fiercest in his attacks on Mr. Trump before his presidential campaign fizzled out last September, ridiculing the Manhattan businessmans distinctive hair and describing him as an egomaniac with no principles and a madman who must be stopped.But in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article this week, Mr. Jindal was singing a different tune about Mr. Trump. Explaining why he would vote for the partys new standard-bearer, he said that Hillary Clinton would be a far scarier alternative. I do not pretend Donald Trump is the Reaganesque leader we so desperately need, but he is certainly the better of two bad choices.Other establishment figures are also coming around faster than some expected. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, publicly endorsed Mr. Trump without hesitation after their meeting on Thursday in Washington. Sheldon Adelson, the casino mogul and passionate pro-Israel advocate, endorsed Mr. Trump in a Washington Post op-ed article on Friday.You may not like Trumps style or what he says on Twitter, but this country needs strong executive leadership more today than at almost any point in its history, Mr. Adelson wrote, calling on all Republicans to coalesce behind him.While critics such as Mitt Romney have continued to speak out against Mr. Trump, much of the Never Trump contingent seems to have gone quiet. For them, there is 2020 to think about, and those who disapprove of the candidate might not want to be seen as having helped Mrs. Clinton win the presidency if she defeats Mr. Trump in November.The biggest uniting force in the Republican Party is the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency, said Ryan Williams, a political consultant and former spokesman for Mr. Romney. That is a motivating factor in mollifying even some of Mr. Trumps harshest critics.Still, for those who fought the hardest against Mr. Trump, making peace will not come easy.Senator Marco Rubio stood by his pledge to support the Republican nominee in an interview with CNN this week, but he struggled to reference Mr. Trump by name and said that his concerns about his former rival continue to apply.The wounds appeared to be most fresh for Mr. Cruz, who until last week was hoping to capture the nomination at a contested convention. He said in a radio interview on the Michael Berry Show on Thursday that he still plans to go to Cleveland July 18-21 to cheer on the delegates, but it was clear that the ill will toward Mr. Trump has not subsided.Well listen, theres time for recriminations and, you know, everyone who was responsible for the rise of Donald Trump, they will bear that responsibility going forward, Mr. Cruz said when asked about the news medias role in Mr. Trumps success.Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, noted that while most parties tend to unify before a general election, some politicians never do. He recalled that Gerald R. Ford never really forgave Ronald Reagan for challenging him for the Republican nomination in 1976, and that Ted Kennedy famously snubbed Jimmy Carter on the Democrats convention floor four years later.For Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump, he surmised, the relationship could be beyond repair after months of sniping that went beyond the usual political fare.When you dub someone for life as Lyin Ted and now suddenly youre smiling with your arms around each other, its a hard-pressed photo op, Mr. Brinkley said."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Unusual Flavor of G.O.P. Race Illustrates a Paradox (The Upshot, May 10) gives an incomplete picture of social choice theory.Yes, the French mathematician the Marquis Condorcet showed that choices may cycle, and Kenneth Arrows generalization of this paradox showed that there is no perfect voting system, but both results are founded on the assumption that voters rank candidates. If, instead, voters grade candidates, these results no longer hold.The simplest grading system is approval voting, whereby voters indicate all candidates they find acceptable (give a grade of 1); the others are deemed unacceptable and receive grades of 0. The candidate with the greatest number of approvals wins the election.Under approval voting, there can be no cycle: The candidate who wins is more approved than every other candidate in paired comparisons.Because approval voting does not restrict voters to supporting only one candidate, it tends to elect the most acceptable candidate over all, not the strongest minority candidate who benefits from a divided field.In the 2016 Republican primaries, polls show that Donald Trump was not acceptable to a significant portion of Republican voters, so he would not have done nearly as well under approval voting.STEVEN J.

{"text": "A torrent of online reaction followed the release on Friday of federal guidance to public school districts in the United States that for the first time addresses how they should enforce the rights of transgender students.The joint directive from the Department of Justice and the Department of Education says that schools must allow students to use bathrooms based on their gender identity and touches on issues including housing, locker rooms, pronouns and gender references on identity documents.The measure, which is the Obama administrations latest to address the civil rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people, has attracted both criticism and support, much of it reflecting bipartisan lines.Representative Steve King, a Republican from Iowa, said the directive was executive overreach. He told CSPAN: And its a topic were likely to bring up in a future hearing before the task force that I chair.In Texas, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told superintendents not to enact the directives: We will not be blackmailed.Rodney Cavness, a school superintendent in Port Neches, Tex., told 12 News: He aint my president and he cant tell me what to do. That letter is going straight to the paper shredder. I have five daughters myself and I have 2,500 girls in my protection. Their moms and dads expect me to protect them.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, said on Twitter: Thank you @USEDGov for standing up for transgender students by ensuring all students feel welcome and safe!Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said on the Today show that he did not believe it was an issue for the federal government.Let the states decide. I think its much better as a local issue. I dont think its a federal issue where the federal government gets involved. And I see whats happening. Its become such a big situation. Everybody has to be protected and I feel strongly about that but youre talking about a tiny, tiny group of population.Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who has sued the Justice Department in a dispute over public restroom access, said the executive branch does not have the authority to be the final arbiter on bathrooms, Colin Campbell, a reporter in North Carolina, wrote on Twitter quoting a copy of the governors statement.The key word transgender was trending on Twitter. It had been tweeted more than 44,000 times from early Friday morning until about noon, according to Dataminr data.Mark Ruffalo, the Oscar winning actor, praised the move.The Transgender Law Centers executive director, Kris Hayashi, expressed gratitude: Transgender students, like all students, just want to be able to go to school, be with their friends, and get an education without having to worry about being singled out and made to feel different.Thousands of people wrote in response to the new directives in comments on The New York Timess Facebook page and on  NYTimes.com.Regardless of the transgender issue, I have a problem with the President being able to authorize the loss of federal aid to government bodies that behave contrary to his wishes, wrote Christian Miller of Saratoga, Calif.Thank you to the Obama administration for taking a stand against bigots and bullies. Children need support, love and understanding. For Trans kids this is a vulnerable age. We dont need any more tragic deaths, wrote Michelle Franca on Facebook.It is not legal for the president to order there to be discrimination in public schools. If transgender people can choose their preferred bathroom regardless of their gender, then the same should apply to everyone who is not transgendered. Obama gets another one wrong, Chris Palsz wrote.I hope they sue the administration WHEN, not IF a case of sexual assault/voyeurism occurs. Childrens rights and safety trump political correctness!

{"text": "Of all that can transpire in a bedroom, nothing can be as titillating to the religious, or those of us who write about them, as a dying mans conversion.Oscar Wildes deathbed baptism remains a coup for the Roman Catholic Church 116 years later, and an embarrassment for those who cherish his legacy of hedonism. In his new biography of the poet Wallace Stevens, Paul Mariani repeats the claim that Mr. Stevens was baptized by a priest as he lay dying in a Hartford hospital.There are others. Karen Edmisten, in her 2013 book Deathbed Conversions: Finding Faith at the Finish Line, recounts, with varying degrees of historical support, the putative deathbed conversions of Buffalo Bill Cody, John Wayne, the gangster Dutch Schultz and the mathematician John von Neumann.The latest controversy about a late-in-life religious turn involves Christopher Hitchens, one of worlds most prominent atheists. In his new book, The Faith of Christopher Hitchens: The Restless Soul of the Worlds Most Notorious Atheist, the evangelical writer Larry Alex Taunton writes about his friendship with Mr. Hitchens, the witty and impious author of God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, who died of esophageal cancer in 2011. Mr. Taunton describes intimate talks that occurred during drives the two took together, which left him wondering if a dying Mr. Hitchens was edging toward belief in God. Unsurprisingly, evangelicals have celebrated the book, while some of Mr. Hitchenss secular friends have winced.Mr. Taunton runs the Fixed Point Foundation, which organizes debates between Christians and atheists. In September 2010, five months after Mr. Hitchenss diagnosis of cancer, he and Hitch drove the 13 hours from Mr. Hitchenss home in Washington, D.C., to a Fixed Point debate in Birmingham, Ala. The next month, after an event in Billings, Mont., they took a seven-hour trip to, and around, Yellowstone National Park.As Mr. Taunton drove, Mr. Hitchens read aloud from the Gospel of John and mulled over the precise reason Jesus wept at the death of Lazarus. Where is grace in the Old Testament? Hitchens asked at one point, in Mr. Tauntons telling. I see it in the New Testament, but God is different in the Old Testament, Mr. Hitchens observed, leading to a discussion of Gods covenant with Abraham.Based principally on these conversations, Mr. Taunton concluded that Mr. Hitchens was seeking  and that he was, at least, open to  the possibility that Christianity was true. Perhaps, Mr. Taunton writes, Mr. Hitchens used his position as a journalist as a kind of professional cover for a very personal inquiry into the faith.Several Christian magazines have trumpeted Mr. Tauntons work. In the Christian journal Books & Culture, Douglas Wilson wrote that fewer things are sadder than the death of a defiant atheist, yet Mr. Tauntons simply outstanding book offers just enough hope for Hitchenss salvation to make it useful for the church. Ministers will be strengthened and evangelists encouraged, he wrote.Secular publications have been kind, too, with Publishers Weekly noting Mr. Tauntons smooth and accessible prose.But in an article by the Religion News Service last month, friends of Mr. Hitchens took exception with the books conclusions.Steve Wasserman, a literary agent and editor, and an executor of Mr. Hitchenss estate, described the book as a shabby business in which unverifiable conversations are made to contradict everything Christopher Hitchens ever said or stood for.Having evangelical friends is a testament to Mr. Hitchenss intellectual tolerance and largeness of heart, not to any covert religiosity, Benjamin Schwarz, his former editor at The Atlantic, was quoted as saying.In an interview, Mr. Taunton said that his rather modest claims were being misunderstood.I wasnt at his deathbed, Mr. Taunton, 48, said. I think on that first road trip Christopher was contemplating conversion. Do I think he had a conversion? No. By the second road trip, he said, the moment seemed to have passed.While The Christian Post declared that, according to the book, Mr. Hitchens was contemplating conversion to evangelical Christianity, Mr. Taunton said that was wrong: Even if Mr. Hitchens had come to some sort of belief, it is not clear what he would have believed in. Jesus Christ? An indescribable higher power? The Jews God (late in life, Mr. Hitchens learned his mother, and thus he, was Jewish)?Contemplating conversion and being close to Christ are two very different things, Mr. Taunton said.Still, Mr. Taunton laces his book with plenty of winks toward hopeful Christians, who would be understandably glad to see the conversion of an atheist as prominent as Mr. Hitchens. He quotes John le Carrs George Smiley, who says, in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (the movie, not the book), The fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt. He writes that Mr. Hitchens had to keep up the front of an unquestioning atheist because it was a matter of professional pride for him to play the part for which he had been hired.Mr. Wilson, who wrote the rave review in Books & Culture, is an evangelical pastor and a college professor. He has also written about private conversations with Mr. Hitchens about Christianity, and he said that Mr. Tauntons experience of the man matches his own.I have been pastoring for decades, Mr. Wilson said, and in my judgment there was more of a personal interest  in Christianity  on Christophers part than the public stage persona would seem to indicate.Michael Shermer, who writes about atheism and science, initially gave the book a fulsome jacket blurb: This book should be read by every atheist and theist passionate about the truth. Since then, he has written on his blog that he would like the blurb removed.Mr. Shermer said he had grown uncomfortable with how Mr. Taunton had, in interviews, used the metaphor of keeping two books, to refer to Mr. Hitchenss bifurcated selves, one public and atheist, the other private and curious about religion. In the book, Mr. Taunton attributes the metaphor to Hitchens himself.In reality, Mr. Shermer said, there is no two books in a deceitful way. But without that assertion about Mr. Hitchens, he doesnt have an interesting media story. Mr. Shermer said it was just not believable that Hitchens was having doubts about his atheism, doubts shared with Mr. Taunton but almost nobody else.But you mean his wife, his family, his books, every interview he ever gave was all deceitful, but you, you got the real story? he said, referring to Mr. Taunton. I dont think so.Mr. Taunton said he was planning to remove Mr. Shermers book blurb, but he questioned his motives.Could the man look any more silly to have written a glowing endorsement only to withdraw it when he took a bit of heat from his fans? Mr. Taunton asked in an email.Mr. Wilson agreed that, whatever the truth about Mr. Hitchenss dying beliefs, the intrigue makes for a good story.Christians like the idea of saved in the nick of time, he said. They like the idea of a cliffhanger ending."}
{"text": "This years high school graduates were 10 years old when the economy hit the skids in 2008. Many college graduates in the class of 2016 were 14. Yet, their economic prospects remain darkened by the enduring effects of the Great Recession.That is not to say there has been no improvement. The class of 16 has more and better-paying job opportunities than earlier post-crash graduating classes, according to a new report from the Economic Policy Institute. But for the most part, todays graduates still face employment conditions that are worse than in 2007, the year before the recession, and are much worse than in 2000, when the economy was last at full employment.The recent unemployment rate for college graduates ages 21 to 24 was 5.5 percent, compared with 4.3 percent in 2000. Their underemployment rate  which includes the unemployed, those who have briefly left the work force and those stuck in part-time jobs  was recently 12.3 percent, compared with 7.1 percent in 2000. And in 2015, nearly 45 percent of college graduates ages 22 to 27 were in jobs that did not require a college degree, compared with 38 percent in 2000. Over the same period, student debt has soared, which means that many of todays graduates are trying to pay off more debt with less secure jobs.The situation for new high school graduates is far bleaker, in part because many lower-wage jobs are being filled by college graduates. Among high school graduates ages 17 to 20, unemployment is nearly 18 percent, compared with 12 percent in 2000. One in three are underemployed, compared with roughly one in five in 2000.The soft labor market has depressed wages, with average hourly pay for young college graduates, recently $18.53, barely higher than it was in 2000, adjusted for inflation. Young high school graduates are averaging only $10.66, lower than in 2000, adjusted for inflation.Without full employment to help push up pay, wages and salaries for all workers lag even as corporate profits rise. But the consequences for young people are particularly severe, because early bouts of unemployment, underemployment and low pay can continue to harm job prospects and earnings over a long period. Ones pay and position starting out has a big impact on subsequent raises and promotions, and thus on accumulated wealth over a career.This trap is especially dangerous for racial minorities and women, who even in the best of times have to combat bias in hiring and pay. For young black college graduates, the recent unemployment rate, at well over 9 percent, is double that of young white graduates. Young female college graduates earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by their male peers, a gap that is bound to get worse as men at the very top of the wage ladder capture an increasing share of total pay.These persistent problems are the result of political failure. Job growth and pay growth were weak and largely ignored as policy issues for most of the 2000s, even before the Great Recession. To restore full employment after the crash would have required sustained government investment in many areas, including infrastructure, education, health care and energy technologies.More public spending could have raised demand at a time of diminished private-sector spending. But Republicans in Congress have rejected that approach and have embraced budget cuts that have hampered broader recovery and growth, at times with the support or acquiescence of Democrats and administration officials.Even piecemeal labor market improvements have been stymied or delayed. A higher federal minimum wage would lift wages for low-earning graduates, and updated overtime rules for salaried workers would lift middle-class pay. But lawmakers last raised the minimum wage in 2007, and it will be 2017, at the earliest, before they do so again. Similarly, the administration is expected to issue new overtime rules soon, but at this late date, putting them into effect will fall to the next administration.In the meantime, the class of 2016, like many before it, will graduate into a tough economy in which even the college educated are not assured a toehold."}
{"text": "MIAMI  Dwyane Wade had a night off recently, so he watched basketball on television. The Oklahoma City Thunder were looking to close out the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night in the Western Conference semifinals, and Wade was struck by the way the game developed.Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were explosive in Oklahoma Citys victory, which came as no surprise to Wade, who has dabbled in the art of clutch performances. But Durant and Westbrook also received some vital help from Andre Roberson, a third-year swingman who scored 14 points. In the previous five games of the series, he had scored 4  total.Roberson was the one who put his imprint on that game, Wade said, and really had one of those special games that took them over the hump.It was Friday morning, hours ahead of the Miami Heats game here against the Toronto Raptors that night in the Eastern Conference semifinal, and Wade, a perennial N.B.A. All-Star like Durant and Westbrook, openly wondered which unsung teammate would emerge for Miami. Someone, in the parlance of pro sports, would need to step up. Someone. Somehow.Sure enough, with their season teetering on the edge, with their roster shredded by injuries, the Heat evened the series at three games apiece thanks to a couple of surprising performances. Goran Dragic, an experienced guard, scored 30 points, which might not have come as a complete shock. But what about Justise Winslow, a first-year forward who started at center and proceeded to change the tenor of the game? Their efforts were a welcome diversion from a series that had, until then, been an inartistic, defense-minded slog.We feel like when we play more aggressive and when everybodys attacking, thats our game, Dragic said.In a move born of equal parts circumstance and desperation, Coach Erik Spoelstra went small against the Raptors, who could neither defend the perimeter nor slow the Heats penetration. The result was a lost opportunity for the Raptors to finish off the series on the road  and another chance for Wade to concoct some of his familiar playoff magic.Game 7 is scheduled for Sunday afternoon in Toronto. Wade is fluent in the language of elimination games. In his career, he has played in seven Games 7s and come away with five wins. Perhaps the city of Toronto has reason to feel nervous.Youre either going to continue playing, or your season is over, Wade said. Thats the reality of it. So you got to give a little more, and you got to do a little more.Then again, what do either of these teams have left? Both were pushed to seven games in the first round. Now, they might as well be clubbing each other with cartoon-size mallets as they vie for the opportunity to face the Cleveland Cavaliers  the extraordinarily well-rested Cleveland Cavaliers, who have yet to lose a playoff game  in the conference finals.For Wade, of course, a meeting with the Cavaliers would be a reunion of sorts with his close friend and former teammate LeBron James. But while Wade continues to push himself to exhaustion, James has not appeared in uniform since May 8, a rare luxury in the middle of a playoff grind.The Heat, who are doing all they can to finally escape Jamess shadow, showed plenty of resolve in Fridays 103-91 victory. At the teams morning shootaround, Spoelstra informed his players that he planned to start Winslow at center. Hassan Whiteside, who usually occupies that role, was out with a sprained right knee, and Spoelstra wanted to generate offense.You never know how its going to work, Spoelstra said.The move reminded Wade of the 2012 N.B.A. finals. In that series, Spoelstra sought to space the floor against the Thunder by playing Shane Battier at power forward and center. On offense, Battier tended to roam to the 3-point line, which put Serge Ibaka, his primary defender, in difficult spots.Ibaka was a big guy who would come to the rim, and Shane would have all day to shoot 3s, Wade said before pivoting to Spoelstras most recent handiwork. Its just unconventional. Sometimes unconventional works. Its not your traditional big man-big man lineup.On Friday, the Raptors Bismack Biyombo, a 6-foot-9 center, played the role of Ibaka as Winslow operated along the perimeter, scoring 12 points. More important, Winslow lured Biyombo away from the rim. That created room for Dragic, who found seams to the basket, and for Wade, who finished with 22 points. It was all connected.We were all spaced out, and they kind of got to go where they wanted to go, Raptors Coach Dwane Casey said, adding, We didnt adjust to it.If Spoelstra gambled by going small, there were a couple of mitigating factors. First, the Raptors were without their own starting center, Jonas Valanciunas, who sprained his right ankle in Game 3. So even though the Heat were still at a size disadvantage, they remained competitive on the glass.Also, Spoelstra trusted Winslow to deliver. His playing time in the series has been sporadic. In fact, after Winslow failed to leave the bench in Game 3, Spoelstra called him that night to assure him that he would have a role going forward.He approaches his profession and competition like hes a 30-year-old veteran, Spoelstra said.The Raptors are still searching for their first trip to the conference finals in franchise history, but they will need to find more balance. On Friday, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry combined for 59 points. No one else scored more than 8.The Heat, on the other hand, figured out how to let some of their lesser lights shine.This is the path, Spoelstra said. You have to embrace competition, attack it and then find different ways to try to win."}
{"text": "SINGAPORE  Is the governments war on Singlish finally over? Our wacky, singsong creole may seem like the poor cousin to the islands four official languages, but years of state efforts to quash it have only made it flourish. Now even politicians and officials are using it.Trending at the moment is ownself check ownself, which was popularized by Pritam Singh, a member of Parliament from the opposition Workers Party. He was mocking the ruling Peoples Action Party (P.A.P.) for saying that the government was clean and honest enough to act as its own guardian.Singlish is a patchwork patois of Singapores state languages  English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil  as well as Hokkien, Cantonese, Bengali and a few other tongues. Its syntax is drawn partly from Chinese, partly from South Asian languages.Steady poon pee pee, from the Hokkien, means to be so poised as to deserve an admiring whistle. A snooty person is yaya papaya: with yaya perhaps originating from yang-yang (god of gods in ancient Malay) or jj (father in old Javanese), and the papaya thrown in for the derisive rhyme. Blur like sotong means to be clueless: Sotong is Malay for squid.Singlish is nimble, practical and dynamic  everyone who speaks it shapes it. Which may explain why, after emerging from obscurity half a century ago like an accidental byproduct of decolonization, over the years it has become Singapores most political language.During British colonial times, English was the language of administration, while street talk was carried out in pasar Malay, or market Malay. English continued to be the preferred means of instruction and governance even after the island became fully independent in 1965, partly because its global currency seemed to advance the young governments modernization agenda.All of Singapores citizens had to learn English, and also Malay, Mandarin or Tamil. In particular, the government took nation-building to mean harmonizing what was spoken by the ethnic Chinese, a majority of the population. From 1979, the authorities aggressively pursued the Speak Mandarin Campaign, requiring every ethnic Chinese to abandon other forms of Chinese, like Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka.But the more the state pushed its purist bilingual policy, the more the territorys languages met and mingled in Singlish. Through playful, day-to-day conversations, the unofficial composite quickly became a formidable cultural phenomenon. Sylvia Toh Paik Choos humor books celebrating Singlish in the 1980s  Eh, Goondu! (Hey, Stupid!) and Lagi Goondu! (Even More Stupid!)  were rare national bestsellers and the defining books of the era.The trend worried the government. State ministers, rather than re-examining pedagogy in schools, began blaming Singlish for declining English standards. The government also saw it as insular and inhospitable to foreigners, and therefore bad for business.In 1999, the countrys late great statesman Lee Kuan Yew declared Singlish a handicap we must not wish on Singaporeans. The next year, the government rolled out the Speak Good English Movement.Singlish, now an enemy of the state, went underground. But unlike the beleaguered Chinese dialects, it had a trump card: It could connect speakers across ethnic and socioeconomic divides like no other tongue could. And in the eyes of the young, continued criticism by the state made it the language of cool.Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yens The Coxford Singlish Dictionary was first published in 2002, and has sold over 30,000 copies. (Coxford is a portmanteau combining talk cock, Singlish for nonsense, and Oxford.) Singlishs status grew so powerful that the Chinese dialects took refuge in it to re-seed themselves.The governments war on Singlish was doomed from the start: Even state institutions and officials have nourished it, if inadvertently. The compulsory national service, which brings together male Singaporeans from all walks of life, has only underlined that Singlish is the natural lingua franca of the grunts. The tourism board cant help but showcase it as one of Singapores few unique cultural creations.In his annual national address in 2006, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a precious contribution to the lexicon. Hoping to one-up a podcast mocking the P.A.P. that involves an argument over whether a noodle dish contains pork liver  its a long story  Mr. Lee mentioned another popular noodle dish, mee siam, without cockles (mee siam mai hum). But mee siam never has cockles, and Mr. Lees blunder happily became Singlish for being out of touch.Singlish seems to thrive on codifying political resistance. To flip-flop on policy matters is to prata, after the South Indian pancake made by flipping dough on a hot plate, another favorite Singaporean dish. To politicize is to politisai, and classic Singlish, with its lazy end-consonant and dirty pun: Sai is vulgar slang for feces in Hokkien.Finally grasping that this language is irrepressible, our leaders have begun to use it publicly in recent years, often in strategic attempts to connect with the masses.During a naturalization ceremony in 2012, as Mr. Lee was encouraging the new citizens to integrate, he conceded, and if you can understand Singlish, so much the better. (He should know.)At a rally during last years campaign for the general election, the P.A.P. leader Teo Ser Luck promised voters a new bus station, afterschool care centers, facilities for the elderly and more. But only when we are voted in, ah!, he warned with a smile, because LIU LIAN BO BAO JIAK! No guarantee of durians to eat!"}
{"text": "Justine Ezarik, known to millions of her fans as iJustine, was one of YouTubes earliest stars. Before Jenna Marbles, Epic Meal Time and PewDiePie began posting videos, Ms. Ezarik was busy building a brand as the attractive girl-next-door who could also beat all the boys in Call of Duty.As a tech enthusiast, amateur cook and a gamer, Ms. Ezarik, 32, has entered her 10th year of recording her life and editing it into bite-size chunks for fans. After a decade of building a family-friendly main channel on YouTube, she has amassed over 3 million fans across a handful of other channels. Her videos are generally bright, goofy  and laden with strategically positioned brand-name products, like Amazon Fresh and Heinz ketchup.With the field of YouTube celebrities growing more crowded, its worth asking: What can we learn from a person who has spent the past decade streaming her life, acting as her own boss and weathering the changing landscape of social media?Start early.The daughter of a coal miner and a gym teacher, Ms. Ezarik grew up in rural Pennsylvania building her own websites. She was 12 when she built her first: I Hate Steve, about a nuisance classmate. (Theyre friends now.)If youre an early adopter of [insert hot new social platform here], interview the next Justin Bieber.Ms. Ezariks segue into early live-streaming paid off. In 2010, she interviewed Justin Bieber, an up-and-coming teenage musician who owed part of his celebrity to the social media platform. At the end of their chat, Mr. Bieber looked appraisingly at his interviewer: Youre adorable.Ms. Ezarik said shes not worried about what superstardom has done to him.I think hes back on track, she said of Mr. Biebers subsequent growing pains, and praised his new album. Go Biebs!Create an ironclad character.When Ms. Ezarik became one of the first users of the now-defunct livestreaming site Justin.tv in 2007, a New York Times reporters response after watching her videos: She left me wondering whether her show was a parody of lifecasting and whether she, like Stephen Colbert, never breaks character.When you meet Ms. Ezarik in person, it is not easy to spot the lines between her and iJustine. She is unfailingly enthusiastic and open. Her mood shifted to downbeat only briefly, when I asked about her problems with Internet stalking and the nasty nature of some online comments.You will be harassed.Yes, even if you are nice to everyone, as iJustine generally is, there can be trouble. Ms. Ezarik said that she and her fellow YouTube personalities dont like to talk about the problems theyve had with online harassment, but said most people in the community have dealt with this problem at some point. Ms. Ezarik said that the authorities didnt take her complaints seriously.I have so much documentation of someone who was harassing me for years, and I took it to the cops, and they actually laughed at me, she said. They were like, he didnt say that he was going to kill you, he just wanted to kill you. So, while her greatest joy is mingling with fans at conventions and meetups, she does not consider attending without hiring security.Being a YouTube star can get lonely.A loner mentality is a trait shared by many successful YouTube stars, Ms. Ezarik said. She cannot even estimate how many hours a day she is by herself in her home, sitting and recording herself in front of a screen. Nor does she have a go-to trick to disconnect. I was going to say video games, but then Im still in front of a screen.She said that the lack of face-to-face interaction can get tough.The biggest obstacle is staying inspired and motivated to keep doing it, she said.Numbers arent everything.Ms. Ezariks subscriber count isnt as high as other big YouTube stars. Jenna Mourey, the comic personality better known as Jenna Marbles, has some 15 million, with an income estimated at $346,000 in 2012 by TubeMogul, an ad-buying site.But iJustine doesnt specialize in viral videos, parodies, shock humor or makeup tutorials. She dedicates most of her programming to highly engaged followers through tech coverage, cooking and experimenting with new video technologies, like virtual reality and 360-degree video.The front-facing numbers that people see dont correlate to what youre doing in the grand scheme of things, Ms. Ezarik said.Seriously. Numbers mean nothing.*Ms. Ezarik wont say how much money shes made over the years, if the income has allowed her to buy a house, if shes a millionaire or how long she could survive if she walked away from it all tomorrow.I dont actually ever look, she said of her bank accounts. Thats what the accountants are for; thats what the investing is for.* Numbers obviously mean something, but its hard to estimate without her help or data from YouTube.Follow your dreams! Or maybe not. Or do!What advice would she give to aspiring iJustines? I would probably say maybe dont quit your job right away.She added: But heck, you know what, maybe quit your job. Because maybe that would be the motivation that you need."}
{"text": "SUNDAY PUZZLE  For many people, solving The New York Times Sunday crossword is part of an overall plan for a lazy weekend morning: Sleep in, pour the coffee, schmear the bagels, do the puzzle.Its a comforting routine to aspire to, but where do you start with such a behemoth of a puzzle? If the puzzles increase in difficulty throughout the week, is it true that the Sunday crossword in the magazine is the hardest of them all?The answers, in order, are:1. Wherever its easiest to gain a toehold, usually with the fill-in-the-blanks or common knowledge clues, and2. No. The Sunday crossword is typically Wednesday-Thursday difficulty. So its big, but its not that tough.This is usually where I would talk about the theme, but today Id like to change things up a bit and first talk about how to get started. Help yourself to a bagel and lets break this puzzle open.Weve talked about wheelhouses and, once again, this is going to depend on what you know. Scour that clue list  maybe more than once  and look for a lifeline.For me, the first entry into the puzzle was 93As Eartha KITT, because Ive been doing this for a long time and I now reflexively write KITT every time I see the words Santa Baby. If you solve enough puzzles, you will do that too, even if you werent alive when the song was recorded.From there, I was able to get 77Ds TASK (Undertaking), because I had the K and there are few words ending in K that would mean undertaking. I now had a toehold and rewarded myself with another cup of coffee.Perhaps you enjoy sports and your gimme was the fill-in-the-blank clue at 112A, 1980s-90s Olympian Jackie Joyner-KERSEE. Again, take advantage of those rarely used letters like the K and use them to spread out: you might not know the specific nickname for bursitis of the KNEE, but with that K there, you can take a very educated guess.Maybe you had a crush on the actor Kevin SORBO, especially when he was playing Hercules in the mid- to late 1990s. It would be perfectly reasonable to know the actor who showed off his muscles  sorry, I meant acting prowess  for six years straight.Now were getting somewhere. Time for that third cup of coffee.This is not the kind of theme thats easily guessed without a lot of work in the crossings, but thats not a bad thing. A theme like this will keep you involved until the very end.Patrick Berry is with us today, and he offers into evidence Exhibit A, nine entries that contain words beginning with the letter A. Mr. Berry changes the spelling of those words to soundalikes and clues them in a punny way, so that the phrase RESISTING ARREST becomes RESISTING A REST and is clued as Fighting off drowsiness? I dont know what your reward system is, but Ive marked my progress with a fourth cup of coffee, and Im pretty sure that the last thing I will have to worry about today is drowsiness. I make a mental note to consider switching to decaf.I especially liked 85As A RIVAL DATE (instead of ARRIVAL DATE) clued as Adversary who shows up at romantic dinners? just because of the hilarious visual and snickered a bit when I solved What Carrie needed after the prom? at 107A (the answer is CHANGE OF A DRESS) because it was on the grisly side.Now that youve got a grip on the way the theme works, lets shakily pour that fifth cup of coffee and look at some of the clues that might trip us up. Theres no stopping us now, and if youre solving in print, the paper stock is perfect for soaking up those coffee drippings from your mug, which might or might not be vibrating at this point. When a constructor opens a puzzle at 1A with a question mark clue, theyre almost daring people to solve, but this isnt so hard if you know how to think about it. The clue is Tired runner?, which could be about someone running to the point of exhaustion, but the question mark indicates that its probably not. Thats your cue to think about the two words in the clue in a different way: Could tired mean something else? How about runner? In todays puzzle, the word tired means having tires and runner means something that runs, so the three letter answer is CAR. 1D is a misdirection clue as well today. Bring it, Mr. Berry. We can handle it. A land line might be a telephone in your home, but a Land line? with the question mark means we have to think about land in other ways. Today, its a literal clue; a COAST is the line of land. Get to know your waterways. You will see them a lot in crossword puzzles. At 117A, the Ligurian sea feeder is the ARNO River. Its not in todays puzzle, but it would be smart to get to know the AARE River in Switzerland as well. 116As Wild and wooly? contains adjectives, so the answer has to be an adjective. You might have guessed that the answer has something to do with sheep, but that is a noun. The appropriate adjective relating to sheep is OVINE. 15Ds Head locks has no question mark, and it sounds like its suggesting a wrestling move, doesnt it? Locks is another word for HAIR, though, and thats the answer today.If youve been following along, you should not only have a good start to the Sunday puzzle, but you should also be incredibly well-caffeinated. Thanks for having Sunday breakfast with me, and let me know what you do to come down off the coffee in the comments.Your thoughts?"}

In February, Nestl, which distributes the candy in Japan, released a sake flavor in time for Valentines Day.For a few weeks in December, shops sold a single stick, not the classic duo, covered in dark chocolate and coated with gold leaf for 2,016 yen, or about $16.Even for a country where shoppers can find fish-ball-flavored Pringles and adzuki bean-flavored Pepsi, actual gold candy seems extreme, but the Kit Kat holds a special place in Japans culinary universe.Kit Kats name echoes the Japanese phrase kitto katsu, or surely win and is often sent as a gift to students before college entrance exams. It is the countrys most popular candy, according to Nestl, which does not release sales figures.Kit Kat is so popular that it is sold at high-end department stores, Kit Kat-only specialty shops and even post offices, and it is so ingrained in the nations snack culture that nearly every region has a signature flavor sold only in that part of the country.As a result a hungry traveler could eat scores of different flavors of Kit Kat.

{"text": "In 1940, David W. Maurer, a professor of linguistics, published a sociological study of the confidence artists culture called The Big Con. The book dived deeply into the hierarchies and language among grifters and served as a source for the 1973 film The Sting. The study touched on how lying affects the ways we move through the world and on the loyalty that exists in the various castes of the grift.These con artists, of course, did not come from the extravagant world that Claire finds herself navigating as she tries to change the course of history in Paris 1745. But, watching Saturdays episode, Best Laid Schemes , I couldnt take my mind off the men Mr. Maurer profiled, thinking that they could teach Claire an important lesson. Everyone has the propensity for larceny, especially when reconciling it as a way to protect loved ones. It could only be a matter of time before the elaborate confident game Claire and Jamie have been playing would upend the promises theyve made to one another.More than their relationship, though, this episode focuses on the importance of friendship and the way Jamies and Claires careful masquerades have impeded them from fostering true connections.Murtagh may be implicitly loyal to Jamie but his patience wears thin. He finds the masquerades and games to be fruitless, preferring a more direct approach. The tension between the two men has been mounting. Once Jamie decides against the duel, thanks to Claires influence, it sets off a chain reaction that leads them to tell Murtagh the truth. Keeping him in the dark about where and when Claire is from has become a liability.Not much of what Jamie says to Murtagh in their mother tongue is understood. Instead were left to measure the shifting dynamics from their troubled facial expressions as Claire watches from above. Murtagh may be a simple man but when he makes a promise he keeps it. His belief in Jamie isnt surprising, nor is his kindness toward Claire when he tells her, I wouldnt want to bear that burden. I am continually drawn to Duncan Lacroixs understated performance of Murtagh.Friendship has never been a major fixture in Claires life. So far this season, she has grown closest to Louise and Master Raymond. The mask she wears is far more complex than Jamies, and she has more to lose if her masquerade fails. She isnt just pretending to carry herself in a certain manner to help undo the Jacobite Rebellion and Prince Charles quest. She also has to maintain the lie of when shes from and keep quiet with the knowledge she holds of the future.She doesnt fit in with the frivolity of Louise and her companions whose privileged status keeps them from empathizing with the poor that huddle on the streets of Paris, or with those that Claire cares for in the charity hospital. Her friendship with Master Raymond feels the most genuine and begs to be further explored. She warns him to flee Paris because the king is preparing to kill several suspected practitioners of magic, something she learns during a tense scene with Monsieur Forez (Niall Greig Fulton). But Master Raymond is too important a figure to disappear from Claires life just yet.I havent talked in much detail about Jamie, Claire and Murtaghs plan to prevent Prince Charles from receiving the money from the wine sale. Thats because it provides the episode with its most leaden moments. (The emotional landscape of their time in France has been fascinating in how it speaks to the ideas of loyalty and family. But Outlander is suffering in adapting such dense source material.)Their plan is successful but leads to unintended consequences: Would Prince Charles refuse to pay his debt at the brothel if the St. Germains wine wasnt stolen by a disguised Murtagh and hired bandits? Would Fergus have ended up in Randalls sights if he didnt accompany Jamie to the brothel to settle Prince Charles debts? Whatever happens to Fergus offscreen leads Jamie to break his promise to Claire and move forward with his duel with Randall.When she learns of this from Suzette she rushes to track down Jamie, with Magnus (Robbie McIntosh) at her side, hoping to keep Jamie from getting himself killed or Frank from having his future obliterated. The duel feels inevitable. Claire may not see that; but its hinted at when Jamie says he owes Frank nothing, then in the next breath says he wants Claire to be able to travel back to Frank in case he doesnt survive. Jamies desire for revenge is boiling underneath the surface, and his ability to lie apparently is deft enough to fool Claire.Best Laid Schemes   ends on a tragic note. Jamie gains the upper hand in the duel, stabbing Randall in the groin. The French police arrive and arrest Jamie as Randall bleeds out in the woods. But its Claire who suffers the most, the stress causes her to miscarry. Blood pools around her ankles as she uses Magnus to steady herself. Thats the thing about con games: The fallout is often worse than the mistruths.Other GossipRandalls actions offscreen must have been especially heinous considering they led to Jamie breaking his promise to Claire and leaving Ferguss fate up in the air.The duel and Jamies confession to Murtaugh are incredibly important events we never see fully, instead they are treated as side excursions in order to advance the plot in other directions. Part of this is because of how attuned to Claires perspective the show is, and part is because there has been a lot of ground to cover as we have gotten deeper into Season 2. Which leaves me to wonder, would this episode be stronger from Jamies perspective?"}
{"text": "Tara Zoumer thought she had found her dream job when she was hired at WeWork, a $16 billion start-up that rents office space to young entrepreneurs. The walls were adorned with Pop Art. Neon light fixtures encouraged employees to Hustle harder, and there was beer on tap.It was like walking onto a set of a movie, Ms. Zoumer said.But shortly after she became an associate community manager in WeWorks office in Berkeley, Calif., reality set in. Ms. Zoumer said she was feeling pinched because her annual salary was only $42,000, a sum that, on some weeks, left her without money to ride the subway.She said she thought many of her duties  leading tours for prospective tenants, tidying up, answering phones and changing the kegs  were more suited to an hourly wage with a possibility for overtime.Ms. Zoumer tried to enlist colleagues to file what she hoped would be a class-action lawsuit to fight for overtime pay. But the company had instituted a policy that could force employees to ultimately resolve disputes through arbitration instead of the courts, which essentially shut down Ms. Zoumers lawsuit, since arbitration bars individuals from joining in a class action.When Ms. Zoumer refused to sign the new policy, she was fired.As once-plucky start-ups like WeWork grow  the companys work force has swelled to 1,500 from 300 a year ago  they are taking a page from the playbook of big corporations, which are increasingly using arbitration to thwart employees from bringing any meaningful legal challenge in court, an investigation by The New York Times found last fall.Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing services, make their drivers sign an arbitration clause. Square, the mobile payment processor, also requires that employees agree to bring disputes to arbitration. In advice to start-ups, Brotman Law, a tax firm in San Diego, promotes the benefits of arbitration for companies doing business over the Internet, emphasizing that it can save significant costs.Amazon and Google also use arbitration to resolve disputes with customers.Far from burying its arbitration clause in its employment contracts, WeWork is proud of its policy. The companys top executives said they thought that by adopting an arbitration clause as part of a broader dispute resolution program, they were staying true to their principles, which prize all levels of employees as members of a single community. WeWork says its employees are eligible for bonuses and equity in the company in addition to their salaries.We want to show the world that this works, Jennifer Berrent, WeWorks general counsel and chief culture officer, a recently created position, said of the dispute resolution program.For start-ups  many of which began in Silicon Valley  the clauses can seem to conflict with professed goals of upending business as usual and being open with employees. Arbitration, by its very nature, is a secretive process that is often lopsided in favor of the employer. That secrecy, federal labor officials said, can allow widespread problems to persist because the process bars employees from sharing their experiences with others who might be in similar positions.They give their young workers Ping-Pong tables and take away their constitutional rights, said Cliff Palefsky, an employment and civil rights lawyer in San Francisco.This month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule that would limit financial companies from using arbitration to prevent their customers from filing class-action lawsuits. But the rule does not apply to arbitration used in employment disputes.As Silicon Valley companies grow from small start-ups into major employers, their labor practices are coming into focus. Despite the popular image that the industry is predominantly made up of nerdy millionaires, many of these growing companies depend increasingly on lower-paid employees.And with some technology companies now working harder to raise money, there are growing pressures on these companies from investors to cut costs  pressures that can fall disproportionately on the workers at the lower rungs.At WeWork, Ms. Berrent said, arbitration is part of a multistep process to resolve disputes. The company adopted the policy after months of discussion about how to deal most fairly with complaints.At the outset of the process, WeWork requires employees to raise any complaints with their managers. If that does not work, the employee and WeWork must try mediation. Only if that fails does the issue go before an arbitrator, whose decision is binding.Ms. Berrent said this process was in keeping with the companys values, settling problems through open collaboration rather than the courts. She confirmed that Ms. Zoumer was fired for not signing the arbitration clause.She said the employees who hold the job that Ms. Zoumer used to have were the soul of the company and its brand ambassadors. She said they performed tasks that were far from menial and were not suited to an hourly wage.Ms. Berrent also notes that while lawsuits are both costly for the employee and confrontational, the company pays for arbitration no matter who wins.Unprotected by an arbitration clause, companies can face litigation that could result in huge settlements. The drug company Novartis paid $175 million to settle a class-action suit brought by female employees over promotions and pay. And more than money can be at stake; Nike had to overhaul its business practices after African-American employees sued over discrimination.At large corporations, many employees have come to expect the clauses as standard. But those working at smaller firms that claimed to treat their employees like family tend to be surprised when they collide with one.When Kevin Ziober, a Navy reservist in Costa Mesa, Calif., first joined BLB Resources, which manages foreclosed properties, the company was just beginning; Mr. Ziober was the 18th person hired.Mr. Ziober had already been at the company for several months when he was asked to sign the arbitration policy in January 2011. He did so without a second thought.It was a decision he would regret. In the fall of 2012, he informed BLB Resources that he was being deployed to Afghanistan. On his last day, the company threw him a farewell party, complete with a cake shaped like an American flag.I was on Cloud 9, Mr. Ziober said, recalling how he phoned his family to tell them about the party.That afternoon, as Mr. Ziober said he was packing up his cubicle, he was called into the human resources office and was summarily fired, according to his legal appeal.The reason for his termination, the company said, was that he was not being included in a federal contract that the company was applying for.In a statement, BLB said the decision not to include Mr. Ziober in the contract occurred months before he informed the company that he was being deployed. The statement added that BLB had offered to allow Mr. Ziober to work on the remainder of his existing contract if he returned in time from his deployment.In 2014, after returning from Afghanistan, he sued BLB Resources for violating a federal law, known informally as Userra, that protects the jobs of service members while they are deployed. A California judge ruled that he would have to take his claim to arbitration.Mr. Ziobers lawyer, Peter Romer-Friedman, has appealed the case, arguing that Userra preserves the rights of service members to go to court.BLB said in a statement that the company is extremely disappointed about Mr. Ziobers allegations and denies them wholeheartedly.With their appeal, Mr. Ziober has waded into an intense battle playing out across the country. In Washington, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced a bill in 2014 that would exempt service members from having to take claims of wrongful auto repossession or improper debt collection to arbitration. An almost identical bill was quashed after intense lobbying by big banks and credit card companies, never making it out of committee. A bill in California that would have prevented companies from requiring employees to sign arbitration clauses suffered a similar fate when Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it last year.The legislative skirmishes point to just how valuable arbitration has become to companies and just how far they will go to defend it.Despite WeWorks arbitration requirement, Ms. Zoumer decided to sue the company on her own, hoping she would prevail in overturning the clause. Ms. Zoumers lawyer, Ramsey Hanafi, filed her case in December over wrongful termination and unfair labor practices, and Boies, Schiller & Flexner, a top corporate defense firm, is representing WeWork.Ms. Zoumer, 31, said she knew she was taking a risk when she challenged WeWork over arbitration. She told the company she needed at least a week to review the policy before deciding whether to sign it. In an email to colleagues, she encouraged them to do the same, citing The Timess investigation into arbitration.Ms. Berrent said Ms. Zoumer was the only employee who refused to sign other than two employees who had planned to leave the company anyway. Ultimately, no other employees joined Ms. Zoumers lawsuit.Younger people dont want to pick fights, but we are losing our rights, Ms. Zoumer said."}
{"text": "Katherine Dunn began writing the comic novel Geek Love in the late 1970s after her young son refused to join her on a stroll through the famous hybrid rose garden in Portland, Ore. Inspired by the diverse blooms there, Ms. Dunn wondered, What if she could have bred a more obedient boy?She wound up dismissing the thought, however, deciding that flaws were more fascinating than perfection.I thought that was actually kind of boring, that search for perfection, she told Caitlin Roper of Wired magazine in 2014. It would be more interesting to go in another direction entirely, to search for something other than the perceived symmetrical, common notion of perfection. Which got me thinking about freaks and mutations that were not considered desirable. Thats basically how it began.Geek Love, published nearly a decade later, went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies and become a National Book Award finalist in 1989. It was her third novel, after Attic in 1970 and Truck in 1971, and the last she would publish. She died on Wednesday in Portland at 70, leaving another novel unfinished.Geek Love was curiously original and imaginative, though some called it bizarre. It revolves around a married couple who own a traveling carnival and breed mutant children as sideshow freaks, both to attract paying customers and to endow their offspring with the inherent ability to earn a living just by being themselves.The offspring include a boy who has flippers instead of arms and legs and a pair of piano-playing conjoined twins. An albino hunchback dwarf narrates the story. Brutality, murderous sibling rivalry and sibling protectiveness are among the storys themes.The novel, which was Sonny Mehtas first acquisition as president and editor at Knopf, was an immediate sensation, finding fans everywhere. Harlan Ellison, the science fiction author and screenwriter, hailed it as transformative. The musician known as Flea, of the band the Red Hot Chili Peppers, pronounced it life-changing.Some critics had reservations. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the poet and novelist Stephen Dobyns, calling it a comic novel about love, betrayal and power, said Geek Love overindulged in sheer spectacle for its own sake.Without the spectacle, the novel is undistinguished, Mr. Dobyns wrote, but that spectacle becomes part of the novels reason for being.Ms. Dunn also wrote prolifically as a journalist about boxing and other subjects for various publications, including her hometown Willamette Week in Oregon, The Oregonian newspaper in Portland and The New York Times. She also reviewed books, recorded voice-overs for local commercials and hosted a radio program.In 1993, professors at the University at Buffalo included Geek Love  along with Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451, Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man, Joseph Hellers Catch-22, Kurt Vonnegut Jr.s Cats Cradle and Mark Twains The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  on a reading list to entice students to literature.Katherine Karen Dunn was born on Oct. 24, 1945, in Garden City, a farm town in western Kansas. Her father, Jack, left home when she was a toddler; her mother, the former Velma Golly, an artist from North Dakota, married a mechanic. The family moved frequently, working as tenant farmers, before settling in Tigard, Ore., when she was 12. Her stepfather ran gas stations.She entered Reed College in Portland as a philosophy major.I enjoyed it until I ran aground in an aesthetics class, Ms. Dunn told Wired magazine. I went in thinking, yeah, art, beauty  my meat, drink and air. But on the first day, I didnt understand a word that was said in class, so I marched out and changed my major to psychology.During a winter break, she found a boyfriend in San Francisco. She traveled with him and took odd jobs (including wrapping Sugar Daddy candy bars on a factory assembly line in Massachusetts); discovered she was pregnant and gave birth in Ireland; returned to Portland when their son was 7; left her boyfriend; and, as a single mother, made a living as a waitress in a diner in the morning, and a bartender at night.In 2013 she married a former Reed College classmate, Paul Pomerantz, who survives her and confirmed her death, saying the cause was complications of lung cancer. She is also survived by her son, Eli Dapolonia, and a brother, Eugene Hall.Ms. Dunns affinity for boxing started when she watched matches on television with her stepfather and brothers.Her book School of Hard Knocks: The Struggle for Survival in Americas Toughest Boxing Gyms won the 2004 Dorothea Lange-Paul Taylor Award, given by the Duke University Center for Documentary Studies. An essay collection, One Ring Circus: Dispatches From the World of Boxing, was published in 2009.Ms. Dunns next novel, Cut Man, a fictionalized account of boxing, was scheduled to be published in 2008 but was never finished. In 2010, an excerpt appeared in The Paris Review, where Ms. Roper was managing editor. It carried echoes of Geek Love.It operates in marginal subcultures, and it stars determined though hapless dreamers, Ms. Dunn said of the work-in-progress in an interview with The New York Times. It pits the art of violence against the violence of art.Did the excerpt portend the publication of the novel itself soon?Soon? Ms. Dunn said. Sure, that would be good."}
{"text": "The recent tribulations of Lending Club, a former highflying peer to peer lender, provide an object lesson for both companies and their investors: When it comes to financial disclosures, less is definitely not more.Celebrated as a Silicon Valley disrupter set to transform the financial industry, Lending Club first issued public shares at $15 in December 2014. Like other wildly popular disrupters (Theranos, the blood-testing company that is now under siege, comes to mind), Lending Club had a star-studded board and a concept that made investors swoon.By directly connecting borrowers with willing financiers, Lending Club said it was turning the banking system into a frictionless, transparent and highly efficient online marketplace, helping people achieve their financial goals every day. Borrowers would get faster and cheaper access to consumer installment-type loans, and lenders would receive higher returns than they would if they had parked their money in a bank.Its shares peaked at almost $28 in late 2014, giving Lending Club a $10 billion market value. Not bad for a company that generated a $33 million loss on $211 million in net revenue that year.Lending Club was the quintessential story stock. Disrupting finance, though, turned out to be harder than promised.Six months after its public offering the companys shares had fallen below the deal price. And in recent months, as doubts about the peer-to-peer lending industry emerged, Lending Clubs shares continued to decline.On Monday came an abrupt announcement. Renaud Laplanche, Lending Clubs founding chief executive and very public face, was resigning. The companys shares plummeted 35 percent. In subsequent days, the stock fell even further.The company cited two reasons for Mr. Laplanches exit. First, Lending Club had improperly sold $22 million of loans to an institutional investor that did not meet the investors standards. In addition, Mr. Laplanche had not disclosed to company directors his stake in a fund in which Lending Club was weighing an investment.Compared with some of the corporate shenanigans weve seen lately, these disclosure failings look relatively minor. So why have Lending Clubs shares taken such a beating?Heres a hypothesis: Investors dont have enough information about the companys operations to keep them confident about its prospects. When shareholders have to rely more on a companys promise than on the reality of its operations, they often flee at the first sign of trouble.In contrast with traditional financial companies, Lending Clubs disclosures are thin. And the companys practices in the area were the subject of a whistle-blower submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission last July. The submission, which I reviewed, contended that the company does not disclose crucial operational measures that investors need to evaluate its business.Lacking, for example, is detailed data on Lending Clubs credit decisions and scoring models, its investors returns and loan performance. Nor does the company provide specifics showing investor satisfaction with its platform.I asked Lending Club about these areas of its financial disclosures. Taylor Hamilton, a spokesman, pointed me to additional information on the companys website. But this data was only modestly enlightening.How does Lending Club assess risks among its borrowers? In its most recent annual filing, the company said that in addition to common tools like borrowers credit scores, it uses proprietary algorithms that leverage behavioral data, transactional data and employment information. The company contends that its strong record of loan performance is evident in its loan origination growth.Nevertheless, Lending Club provides scant details on borrower performance by type, product or vintage (the year in which a loan was made). Other financial institutions provide this kind of data routinely.In its filings, the company does show two tables of charge-off rates on its loans, reflecting borrower defaults. One table spans three years, the other, five. Good luck figuring them out.The Lending Club spokesman suggested I also consult a chart on the companys website showing the adjusted net annualized return that its investor-lenders receive. But this chart, which the company noted was for informational purposes only, was limited to larger investors, those buying at least 100 of the companys notes or bundled loans.Since the company is a peer-to-peer lender, the performance on smaller loan purchases would be a more helpful measure.Lending Club filings also state that high reinvestment rates prove that its investor-lenders have confidence in its marketplace. But the company has not disclosed actual reinvestment rates in its regulatory filings.Scott Sanborn, the companys president, recently told investors in a conference call that its reinvestment rate hit 85 percent over the past two quarters.If the company published these figures regularly, shareholders could watch for investor churn, a risk to its business that Lending Club has acknowledged. It must maintain relationships with existing borrowers and investors, it says in filings.Another question raised by Lending Clubs regulatory disclosures is how different from traditional lenders it truly is. The company says it has a wide range of investors, including retail and high-net-worth individuals, banks and finance companies, hedge funds, foundations, pension plans, and university endowments. In its first-quarter presentation, the company said that 56 percent of its loan originations were financed by institutions, with the remainder funded by individuals.But in its most recent annual report, issued in February, Lending Club noted that a relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace.If most of Lending Clubs loans come from a handful of investors, such as brokerage firms, hedge funds or pension plans, thats not so revolutionary a business model. That looks a lot like a bank. More troubling, if one or two of these investors pulled back from Lending Club, the companys funding capacity could drop significantly.On Tuesday, the company told regulators that its quarterly financial filing, due that day, would be delayed until Monday. That filing, Lending Club said, will reflect significant changes in the companys results of operations for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to those of the first quarter of 2015.Full and detailed data about a public companys operations is crucial if investors are to remain confident about its prospects. While its not unusual for companies to want to limit their disclosures, Lending Club no longer has that luxury. If it wants to regain its shareholders trust, being more forthcoming is a good way to start.The investor lesson here is also clear: Dont let enthusiasm for a purportedly innovative business model replace hard-nosed analysis of a companys operations. And if the data to do that analysis isnt there, move on."}

{"text": "Don DeLillos Zero K, published earlier this month, is his 16th novel, which means he may have more books under his belt than public appearances. The rarely seen author recently showed up at the 92nd Street Y in New York to read from the new book, and to talk about his life and work with fellow novelist Dana Spiotta.After reading a few pages at a lectern, DeLillo sat down next to Spiotta. Ive lost my voice, he said. Can I go home now?No such luck. He had to stay and chat, and what he said could make one wonder if a memoir is in the offing. I think of myself more and more as a kid from the Bronx, he said. The memories become more and more clear. He recalled working as a park attendant when he was a teenager. He never wore his uniform, so visitors wouldnt know he was there to help. I would sit on a bench and read, he said. The guy who ran the place didnt seem to mind.His personal motto, taken from James Joyce, was silence, exile, cunning. ... Even though I never went into exile and Im not that cunning. Its the silence part.Generously (and evasively), DeLillo attempted to steer the conversation toward Spiottas work, but his interlocutor wasnt having it. When she told him that naming things and knowing the names of things was incredibly important in your work, DeLillo wryly shot back: It is?Spiotta asked about the humor in his work, and his method of deploying it. It comes or it doesnt, DeLillo said. I dont know what else to say. The audience laughed.QuotableWriting a novel strikes me as a lot like raising a child, in the sense that you have a certain amount of control, or you hope you do. And your job is to guide it to a place where it will leave you.  Justin Cronin, in an interview with Houstonia magazineA Slow CureThe acclaimed novelist James Salter died last year at 90, and now a small new book, The Art of Fiction, collects three lectures he gave at the University of Virginia near the end of his life. He spoke about his favorite writers, the importance of style in prose and the darker moments in a creative career. He mentioned a devastating review in The New York Times of his novel Light Years, followed by a second, indifferent review in the paper. When his editor broke the news, Salter looked for a silver lining. Was there something in it though, some phrase or a couple of words that could be used in an ad? There was not.Its a rare writer who doesnt experience rejection at one point or another, Salter said, and the book was after all not anything sacred, though it had been sacred to me. But this is philosophically speaking and was of no use at the time. Philosophy is a slow-acting cure."}
{"text": "CAIRO  Two Egyptian courts on Saturday sentenced to prison 152 people who took part in a street protest last month, in a sharp escalation of a campaign by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to suppress political dissent in the country.The protesters, who had been demonstrating against the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, received sentences of between two and five years, according to public prosecutors and defense lawyers. Also, fines of 100,000 Egyptian pounds apiece  about $11,260 at the official exchange rate or $9,000 at the parallel rate  were levied against 101 of those convicted.The tough sentences come at a time when Mr. Sisi has appeared unnerved by a sudden wave of criticism over Egypts faltering economy, and has become intolerant toward even playful opponents.On Monday, the police arrested five members of a satirical performance group who posted videos online that mocked Mr. Sisi. They joined a wave of writers, poets and activists jailed since January. The government has also barred prominent human rights campaigners from leaving the country or has frozen their assets.The arrested satirists, ages 19 to 25, face a number of charges, including incitement of terrorism. In response to the crackdown, some Egyptians have struck back at Mr. Sisi on the Internet with mocking slogans that suggest he fears mobile phones.At least 400 other demonstrators still face prosecution over the two protests in April about the Red Sea islands, Tiran and Sanafir. Sameh Samir, a lawyer representing some of the 51 people convicted on Saturday, said many had been randomly picked off the street, and would appeal their sentences.Thousands of Egyptians have been jailed since 2013, including many who are languishing in pretrial detention. Others have fled the country, fearing arrest. On Saturday, Sanaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent activist, started a six-month sentence for insulting the judiciary.Even so, Mr. Sisis government has sought to project itself as a key ally in the Wests fight against Islamist extremism across the Middle East. On Friday, Egypts foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, met with Secretary of State John F. Kerry in Washington to discuss their common visions that would increase stability in the region, an Egyptian statement said.The United States provides Egypt with $1.3 billion in annual military aid and is a key weapons supplier. The State Department notified Congress on Friday that it intended to sell Harpoon II submarine missiles to Egypt in a deal reportedly worth $143 million.The safeguards that underpin such military sales to Egypt have been questioned by the United States Government Accountability Office. On Thursday, the office issued a report that detailed how Egypt had hindered American efforts to verify the use and security of sensitive military items such as night-vision goggles and riot-control gear.Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, said the report showed an alarming and unacceptable amount of deficiencies in Americas human rights vetting programs for Egypt.In response to international criticism, Mr. Sisi has made speeches alluding to foreign conspiracies and urging Egyptians to follow him without question. Still, he continues to face criticism from sometimes surprising quarters.On Friday, Seif Eldin Mustafa, the Egyptian who hijacked a passenger jet that was forced to land in Cyprus in March, appeared in court in Cyprus wearing a T-shirt that read, Release the 63 Egyptian girls, you liars, The Associated Press reported. The T-shirt was referring to women held in Egyptian jails whose release was a demand made by Mr. Mustafa. Lawyers for Mr. Mustafa, whom the Cypriot authorities describe as psychologically unstable, are resisting an Egyptian extradition application, arguing that he would face torture and an unfair trial in his home country."}

{"text": "ROME  MY father, Marty Curran, known as Charlie after he took over Charless Liquor Store, was a Yiddish-speaking second baseman on the Hope High School team in Providence, R.I., and, unlike his cornet-playing brother Bob and sister Adele, played the trombone.Sunday afternoons he took his horn, and me as page turner, to a vaudeville theater in Pawtucket, where he played in a stage band for sundry down-home acts who opened for a Hollywood feature film that we in the band watched backward from the far side of the screen. The trombone was off limits to me as a young musician; the only instrument I was supposed to learn was the piano. But the 1910 Olds trombone in its green velvet-lined case, exuding an inviting smell of mold mixed with slide oil, seduced me.The horn was put away during my fathers liquor store days, but when hard times hit a few years later he took it out again, bought himself a cheap double bass, and formed a lasting and successful 1950s bar mitzvah band: the Marty Curran Orchestra, complete with signed white-and-blue folding cardboard music stands and a brochure stating Music for Every Occasion.By then Id long since stolen into the upstairs closet where the trombone was stored, found some moth-eaten beginners trombone book, and taught myself to play well enough to become the whole trombone section of the Summit Avenue Elementary School Orchestra, whose chaotic, detuned chance music I have been trying to emulate ever since. In the end my father didnt mind, but he said, Dont tell Mrs. Einstein (my piano teacher from Odessa).At the serious age of 11, I formed a dance band with my buddy, Joe McCarthy, who played percussion. Id begun to get the hang of piano chords, but what I really wanted was to be able to play those changes on the trombone, to be one of those players who can make the band sound like some contrapuntal gearbox where the trombone tailgates  ripping, growling, sliding and blat-farting  as if imposing order on a floor of 300 bumper cars.The kids fell out of their seats in the Nathan Bishop Junior High assembly hall when Joe and I hit Aint She Sweet on trombone and drums. Later, with other kids, we formed a no-name dance band playing standards from stilted written-out arrangements called combo-orks. I was the trombonist but wanted to be the pianist  the other kid wasnt really good enough. The trombone was a good friend, but the piano was clearly becoming me.By the time I graduated from Classical High the piano had become my main instrument, but the trombone gave me a seat in the Brown University symphony orchestra directed by the inspiring Marty Fischer, and a place in the band. So I found out what Brahms were, and learned how a wacky marching band could walk randomly on a football field playing Bugs Bunnyesque music for the Ivy League. Ive been orchestrating brass ever since.In 1960 I disappeared into the murky dodecaphonic seas of the Yale School of Music and placed my dads trombone in mothballs. But first I gave it one last oil swipe with the Leonard Suess band at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. Leonard played the trumpet and did a ventriloquist act with a hand-held puppet whose name Ive forgotten. I was mainly the groups pianist, but since three of us played the trombone Leonard concocted a Seventy-Six Trombones number complete with unison choreography  a winner with any mob of patriotic alcoholics.After that the trombone went back to rest in that upstairs closet in Providence, where it stayed until the late 80s. When my father died, I thought I might want to use it in a new composition, and I brought it down from Overhill Road to New York. But the old thin black trombone case landed in the basement of my friend Melissa Goulds apartment building and there, after a shake-up of the tenants storage spaces, it disappeared.I was heartbroken. That horn was my one material musical link to my father and to my own early years. My ambition to search for it in all the pawn shops in the city melted in the summer heat. One old Olds was missing in action  gone, just had to live with it.Like a religious icon, that simple instrument had been a powerful catalyst in my becoming a professional music maker. Its primitive brass tubing, curves and spit-valve and all, was itself a resonant gesture, resembling a person about to start making music. For me, it was the essence of unabashed musical Americana, its mouthpiece an amalgam of chopped liver, Moms tuna salad, kosher hot dogs, kasha and planetary garlic breath fused with silver and steel and a century of house mold. Gone, it left only a tarnished brass memory. For years, the pristine analog sound of Kid Ory on Dixie trombone could make me stop, listen and open a nostalgic bottle of India Pale Ale any time of day or night.A few months ago, Melissa moved from her longtime Fifth Avenue apartment to a place in the country, and amid her things piled high, misplaced, or forgotten in the basement emerged a slim black musty instrument case. It was it, and on the inside the instrument was intact. She emailed videos immediately to me in Rome, proof it was real: trombone life after death, a brass miracle, then bubble-wrapped the case to the hilt and Fedexed it over.I let it sit for a few days to acclimatize. Then with my wife, Susan, snapping pictures I carefully removed the layers of wrappings one at a time with a kitchen knife  and then opened the latches to reveal an unpolished silent brass corpse inside, smelling exactly the same as it did when I surreptitiously opened that case for the first time some 70 years earlier in Providence.I took it out, assembled the beautiful, slender parts, deposited some spit on the slide, which worked smoothly, and proceeded to play the prelude to the third act of Lohengrin, which I had never before tried in my life. I got through three arpeggios before my lip turned blue, and I felt as if I had just had a triple bypass while standing on two feet. Soon Martys childhood horn will forget that it ever spoke Yiddish and start speaking proper Italian."}
{"text": "THE HIGH PLACESStoriesBy Fiona McFarlane280 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26.Fiona McFarlane is an Australian writer whose 2013 novel, The Night Guest, assumed the blurred perspective of an aging widow succumbing to dementia, convinced shes sharing her remote seaside house with a tiger. This odd premise, seemingly more appropriate to the narrow confines of a Gothic short story, is played out, with suspense and narrative vigor, across the entire novel, which was a finalist for both the Miles Franklin Literary Award, Australias major book prize, and the Guardian First Book Award.Now comes an equally assured collection of short stories, set in various locales (Australia, England, an unnamed Pacific island, Greece) and time periods, with a pattern of recurrent themes: the lives we share with animals (wild, domestic and imaginary); the vagaries of religious faith; the occasions of impulse or accident when, as McFarlane says of one of her momentarily audacious characters, another life occurred to him.The high places invoked in McFarlanes title are sometimes literal. World War II paratroopers in Those Americans Falling From the Sky bring unexpected drama  a small piece of the war delivered directly to us  to the lives of an Australian family in the Outback: From a distance it looked soft  the billowing descent, the padded green, all the silk folding onto the warm yellow grass, like our mother pouring thick cake batter into a tin. Then a plane crashes in the hills and the body parts of downed men  each a jigsaw of distinct pieces  dont quite add up, until a missing airman is discovered a little too close to home.The excellent story Mycenae begins ominously, as though bad things are bound to happen at high altitudes. What a terrible thing at a time like this: to own a house and the trees around it. Janet sat rigid in her narrow seat. The plane lifted from the city and her house fell away, consumed by the other houses ... as the horizon lost authority. As grad students in England, the two couples in the story  one Australian, the other American  shared a small rented house in a Cornish town that had gathered itself on the cliffs as if in preparation for a springtime suicide. Forty years later, undeterred by Janets well-founded foreboding, they reunite in Athens and take a day trip to the ancient fortress of Mycenae, which the American wife dismisses as a hill with rocks on it. A pervasive absence, as if some other species  the gods  had lived here carelessly, then abandoned it, looms over the unsettling ending, when seemingly the least vulnerable of the characters, the pompous American husband, who in his youth had been famous for refusing to engage in small talk, is abruptly toppled from his self-satisfied superiority. We never should have come, Janet says. But she was glad they had.Other high places register the wreckage of lost religious faith. An addled minister, his black bowler hat perched upright on his narrow head, like a fortified town on a hilltop, believes his pet parrot, with a Pentecostal lick of yellow flame on its head, is a messenger of God. Chased from the church, man and bird head for the liberating mountains. In Good News for Modern Man, a garrulous marine biologist named Birch, armed with binoculars, keeps tabs on a captured colossal squid he calls Mabel. From his sticky cliff on a volcanic island off the coast of New Zealand, he also spies on local girls bathing. When I began my study of the colossal squid, he confesses, I still believed in God. Now, instead, he converses matter-of-factly with the ghost of Darwin. When a band of protesters arrives, intent on freeing Mabel, Birch decides to take action of his own.There is in these tales a recurrent feeling of queasy anticipation, as one of McFarlanes characters observes, as if some terrible thing might happen at any moment. In one story, two young brothers, daring each other on, climb high into the branches of an artificial Christmas tree at a mall, even as it shakes alarmingly, like something in a fairy tale waking up. Its a mood you associate with Flannery OConnor, evidently one of McFarlanes influences, as well as Patricia Highsmith. In the disturbing title story, a drought-addled sheep farmer, hearing on the radio that significant biblical events tend to happen on hilltops like Ararat and Golgotha, packs up his few remaining sheep and his possibly clairvoyant son and heads for the hills, since God is in the high places. It turns out, however, that father and son have different hopes for their burnt offerings. The father, understandably, prays for rain. Thats all you want? his son asks, incredulously. As for himself, he wants to be changed. Only one of them gets his wish.There is a countervailing tendency in these tales, as though safety itself is the dangerous fate to be avoided. Like the teacher in the story titled Buttony, many of McFarlanes characters feel the urge to live in a heightened way. Risks of various kinds are at the heart of Art Appreciation, a fine story about an insurance agent and sometime gambler named Henry, whose mother has won the lottery, though her hoped-for largess remains uncertain. At one point, Henry impulsively plunges his arm into a fountain adorned with a statue of Apollo, until it had soaked far beyond the elbow of his navy suit, and he held it there, or rather the water seemed to hold it. He can think of no reason for this sudden, sodden audacity that nonetheless strikes him as remarkable. When, equally impulsively, he kisses a discarded girlfriend among the trees outside the dog track, he feels another brush with Greek myth, as if he were only pressed to a tree that had once had a girl inside it. At such moments, danger seems to release the imagination.While lesser writers use similes to render descriptions more vivid, McFarlanes heighten aspects of her characters and advance her plots. When the marine biologist compares his diaphanous squid to my mothers underwear soaking in a holiday basin, we get a sense of both his deep attachment to the squid and his stunted sexuality. When the sheep farmer likens his wifes body to the thin run of a creek in the bed, a low creek that puts out the small noises of a comfort it cant deliver, we know the drought has extended from the parched fields to his own bedroom. In a clever story called Exotic Animal Medicine, a veterinarian is called from her impromptu wedding to place an emergency catheter in a cat. When she drives as if she were landing an enormous plane full of porcelain children on a mountaintop, we can tell what a careful surgeon she is, even as we surmise that there will be some breakage before the story is over.My one mild complaint is that the endings of these expertly deployed stories are occasionally so open-ended that I found myself asking, What just happened? Was Mabel set free? Did the impulsive insurance agent choose the girl by the tree or the strait-laced fiance who drives him crazy with her art-appreciation classes?The enigmatic ending can itself become predictable, and I sometimes wished, with a kindred impatience, for a conclusive click of the shut box. Yet why not say what happened? as Robert Lowell put it. Still, the narrative impulse behind these vivid tales is understandable. McFarlanes instinct as a storyteller is to let some puzzles remain unsolved, to honor the bony-beaked messenger bringing no news, as she writes of the colossal squid. But now I think she should remain a mystery, the marine biologist concludes. There must be some things in the world that no one sees and no one knows."}
{"text": "The 1925 Upper East Side building where the celebrity stylist Jill Swid Rosen and her husband, Eric S. Rosen, a money manager, have lived for the last five years exudes prewar charm, with its limestone-and-brick facade and white-glove lobby. But inside their full-floor penthouse there is more of a contemporary, downtown vibe.The co-op apartment, PHAB, at 791 Park Avenue, between East 73rd and 74th Streets and a quick stroll from Central Park, was completely overhauled in a nearly three-year renovation. It now has more of an open, loftlike aesthetic, along with numerous high-tech flourishes like surround sound, a humidification system, soundproofing and intercom monitoring.The walls in the main entertaining space were also fortified to support the couples hefty and bold modern artwork.This is not your dads Upper East Side co-op, said Mr. Rosen, the chief investment officer of Reef Road Capital, adding, It was a gut renovation down to the studs. We had to take everything out and start from scratch.But now the couple plan to start over somewhere else. They are putting the residence on the market, in hopes of moving downtown to be closer to their childrens schools. The asking price for the nearly 4,300-square-foot, 16th-floor apartment, with a 3,000-square-foot terrace, is $26.9 million, said John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens, who is listing the property. The monthly maintenance is $9,485.Its a young couples interpretation of a prewar penthouse, Mr. Burger said. Its very livable and very user-friendly. This apartment also has light in every inch of it.One of the best features, he and the couple pointed out, is the connection to the outside space from nearly every room, along with the vast cityscape vistas, which include the Empire State Building, seen from the units three dozen large windows.What Ill miss the most is all the light  we dont leave the lights on a lot, said Ms. Rosen, a freelance stylist whose celebrity clientele has included the actress Uma Thurman and the television anchor Anderson Cooper.The penthouse was a combination of two top-floor units when the Rosens, who previously lived in Greenwich Village, bought it in 2007 for around $9.8 million from Glenn R. August, the chief executive of the investment firm Oak Hill Advisors. Because of that, there are two entrances and two private elevator landings.The main entry opens to a grand 12-by-13-foot gallery embellished with bronze moldings and floors of Italian limestone and white inlaid marble. On one wall sits a 1965 John Chamberlain sculpture of discarded car parts, one of the many pieces of midcentury artwork showcased throughout. (Mr. Rosen said he added the humidifying system and -inch-thick plywood in the walls to benefit the couples vast collection.)Off the gallery is a 28-by-15-foot living room, with a wood-burning fireplace and a separate area carved out as a library. The space flows into the formal dining room and, beyond that, the eat-in kitchen with a six-foot granite island and a built-in bench for dining. Nearby is a wet bar and wine storage for up to 500 bottles. The floors in the kitchen are wide-plank white oak, and in the other entertaining rooms radiant-heated limestone.Midcentury furniture by designers like Edward Wormley, Gio Ponti and Ren Gabriel abounds, mingling with paintings by Adolph Gottlieb, Norman Bluhm, William Anastasi and Richard Pousette-Dart. (The furnishings are not included in the sale, but may be purchased separately; the five built-in flat-screen TVs, however, will remain.)The home has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, connected with an in-wall intercom monitoring system. The master suite features a sitting alcove, two sizable dressing rooms and a custom limestone tub. There is also a soundproof playroom, where Mr. Rosen and his son and daughter often play music together.In the winter, he said, the kids had snowball fights on the terrace.Landscaped by Michael Walter of Lexington Gardens with an assortment of plants and flowers, including boxwood, hydrangeas, Japanese roses and ivy, the terrace has been the setting for both childrens birthday parties and fancy fund-raising soirees. Outdoor speakers pumped music to the guests.The Rosens said they are looking to move to a place that needs little work. I assure you now, Mr. Rosen said, that we wont be gut-renovating another apartment."}
{"text": "When Selina Meyer learns shes been thrust into the role of President of the United States in Season 3s Crate, she responds by having a laughing fit on a bathroom floor while Gary, equally excited by the news, tries to prevent his nose from gushing blood. That scene  perhaps the greatest scene of the entire series?  occurs mere minutes after Selina meets with a struggling Syrian immigrant couple and can barely hold back her tears, not because of their plight, but because she thinks shes lost the primary.Both of those moments come to mind while watching Sundays episode, Mother, which sends Selina yo-yoing along a spectrum of emotions as she copes with her mothers death and a Nevada recount in which the tallied ballots dont add up in her favor. Once again, elation and sadness smack into each other in uncomfortable ways, turning Selina into a bundle of uncontrollable, hysterical feeling. Were only four episodes into Season 5, but given her performance in this episode, it feels like Julia Louis-Dreyfus has locked up another acting Emmy.There are two big scenes this week that echo those aforementioned ones in Crate. The first happens when Selina hugs a grieving Catherine in her mothers hospital room, while giggling like a maniac on nitrous oxide because shes also just learned that the newly discovered ballots in Nevada will be counted.What Ms. Louis-Dreyfus does here is even more magical than that Season 3 restroom crackup because Selina is working through so many layers. Shes genuinely happy about the recount news  the way she celebrates just seconds after her mother dies makes it clear that politics always comes first  but shes also shoving down her feelings of loss with every deranged giggle. Its what politicians do every day: They put on a happy face during campaign speeches or news conferences no matter what feelings lie beneath. That skill  or, if you prefer, psychosis  is so ingrained in Selina that she has no idea how to strip away the facade and deal with her real sadness. As a result, the scene is funny, squirm-inducing  so squirm-inducing that even Gary is itching to get away from Selina  and heartbreaking all at once.Veep wouldnt be Veep if Selina responded to her mothers imminent demise without a.) being flippant and b.) doing a bit of political calculus. When Kent informs her that if her mother passes, she may benefit from a death bump in her approval ratings, its hard to tell whether Selina decides to remove her mothers intubation tube for the sake of the bump or her mothers benefit. Yet, the writers Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck, as well as this episodes director, Dale Stern, take care to avoid making Selina seem like a complete monster. Theres a moment, when she tucks her mothers hand (nails freshly polished) underneath the bedsheet, thats one of the more tender things thats ever happened on this show. I may even have teared up a little.Of course, tender doesnt stick around for long on Veep, which brings us to the second key sequence that calls back to Crate: the eulogy Selina delivers at her mothers funeral. This time, bad professional news  Selinas not only lost Nevada but, thanks to the newly counted ballots, also the popular vote  causes her to behave in a manner that actually suits the occasion. She gets up to the dais, prepared to read a speech that slams her mother for not allowing a young Selina to practice at the better of the familys two pianos. But instead, she breaks down. I have lost so much, she blurts out through her tears. Even though she mostly means the votes, shes still managed to save herself from sounding like the biggest ingrate in the history of speakers at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.The shots of Ben and Gary in the front pews, openly bawling, are a nice touch. They clearly feel for their boss  or, probably, are already mourning the potential loss of their jobs.One could argue that this episode is a little too predictable. When Ben gets that cellphone call right before Selina stands up to deliver the eulogy, for example, its pretty obvious its going to be bad news and that its going to make Selina cry, the same way she cried in front of that Syrian couple two seasons ago. But even when this show recycles certain elements, it does so in such a different context and with such hilarious detail that it doesnt feel problematic. What might feel repetitive on another show just feels like Veep playing to its strengths.There are a lot of strengths here, too. Theres the moment when Selinas ex-husband, Andrew, introduces his significant other and Gary  so accustomed to whispering intel into the presidents ear  leans forward to unhelpfully say, I dont know her. Theres Selinas attempt to pray in the hospital by saying lift me up, not to God but to Gary, so hell help her off the floor. Theres the attempt by Mike and his wife, Wendy, to endear themselves to the ideal surrogate mother by claiming theyre Christian and members at Our Lady of the Holy Womb of Jesus. (This episode is filled with religious references that highlight that nothing is sacred on Veep. ) Theres also the great, emotionally fragile performance that Sarah Sutherland delivers as Catherine, the one person in her family who is heartbroken for the right reasons.And then theres Tom James, again proving that hes the guy who always knows exactly what to say. At the funeral, he summarizes Selinas state of mind about her mothers death and the congressional fight shes facing with the perfect expression of sympathy: I hated my father. To Congress we go.Sure, maybe its true that, as Kent says, those you love cannot be lost because they are always a part of you. But Tom and Selina both know that the votes you didnt get, those are gone forever."}

{"text": "House Greyjoy is a clan of oceangoing raiders in Game of Thrones, a storm-soaked, humorless bunch even by the grim standards of the hit HBO fantasy series.Alfie Allen, 29, plays Theon Greyjoy, a fan-favorite character who has suffered more than most in the course of the show, currently in its sixth season. He has been kidnapped and castrated, has switched sides and is currently on the way back to his ancestral castle, where, judging by the teaser for Sundays episode, a showdown with his sister awaits.But Greyjoy seafaring skills werent much in evidence last Friday, when Mr. Allen, a lifelong Londoner with a winking laddish charm, was in New York to participate in practice races for next years Americas Cup.Im not an experienced sailor, he said after briefly joining the British team, officially known as Land Rover Ben Ainslie Racing. Mr. Allen was the sixth man, a nonfunctional position that may just as well be called celebrity ballast.They need the weight of a person sitting on that spot, the back center, he said later, in the restaurant of the Conrad Hotel in Battery Park City, near the teams mooring at the North Cove Marina.Mr. Allen is a slightly built man with fair hair and piercing blue eyes, who weighs, he said, 10 stone. That is 147 pounds, or two-thirds of the 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) the sixth man is expected to provide. The rest was made up by weights.I wasnt really doing much, he said. You sort of lie down in the back and watch them do their thing. Ben Ainslie, the English competitive sailor, was lovely, Mr. Allen said. Youre not supposed to talk to the team when youre on the boat, but they were talking to me. And you cant swear.He added, I swore.Friday was cold and wet, conditions that are familiar to Mr. Allen from filming in Northern Ireland.Id say just shooting Game of Thrones prepared me for that sort of thing, because HBO likes to keep it real, he said. When you see me sleeping with the dogs, Im really in there with the dogs, in the dirt. It definitely can get pretty freezing.Mr. Allen is sometimes portrayed by British newspapers as a party boy, but on Friday evening, he was a model of rectitude, nursing a hot tea even as his retinue of three handlers (some of whom had been on duty in the elements for 12 hours) moved on to adult drinks.I got you the malbec, he told his manager, solicitously, as she motioned to order another glass of whatever it was she was drinking.I would love a malbec if shes having a malbec, a weary publicist added.Mr. Allen, who was smartly dressed in a John Varvatos collarless jacket, immaculate white Nike Air Force 1 low-tops and a T-shirt from the artist Mike Kelleys posthumous exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, merely cupped his tea, a slightly forced study in boyish innocence.Mr. Allen grew up among artists, musicians and filmmakers. His father is an actor, his mother a film producer, and his sister the pop singer Lily Allen.For years, my dads friend Joe  Strummer  was just my dads friend, he said. And it was only when I was 12 or 13 I learned that he was the lead singer of a band called the Clash.Mr. Allens popular cultural debut came 10 years ago, as the subject of a single from his sisters debut album. The song, Alfie, portrayed him as a hopeless teenage stoner, in need of an intervention. I just cant sit back and watch you waste your life away/You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid, Ms. Allen sang in her cheerful, upbeat style.The song is born out of love for me, he said, adding that he was in Canada getting qualifications to teach kids how to snowboard when it was released. My sister, I guess, she was missing me. I didnt really expect it to be what it was.That all seems very long ago, six seasons into the worlds most successful TV show. Now, Mr. Allen has his pick of projects. This week, he began rehearsing The Spoils, a play written by and co-starring Jesse Eisenberg, which debuted in New York last year and is having a London run this summer.As for Theon: His father, the Lord Reaper of Pyke, was recently hurled to his death, creating a power vacuum in the Iron Islands. It seems very likely that the young lord will have to battle his ambitious sister to become the new head of House Greyjoy.Right, Mr. Allen?Maybe something close to? he offered, stroking his blond whiskers. But its not. So youll just have to wait and see."}

{"text": "In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Thomas Mallon and Leslie Jamison discuss the best writing about brothers and sisters.By Thomas MallonIt is the brotherly bond, more than any paternal one, that dominates Legends of the Fall.The late Jim Harrisons Legends of the Fall is itself a sort of sibling, the title novella in a volume containing two others. Best ever? Hardly. But sometimes interesting can be better than best, and this moody, unstable story  full of shifts in pacing and focus  stays with a reader well after it has concluded with the burial of Tristan, the middle and most magnetic of the three Ludlow brothers created by its author.We see them together in the books opening pages, as they leave their fathers Montana ranch for the Western Front of World War I. Distinct as brothers in a fairy tale, the boys are partly characterized by their fathers look around their now-empty rooms: Alfred, the striver and future politician, has left behind sentimental bric-a-brac, dumbbells, self-help books; Samuel, the gentle and aspiring naturalist, will be separated from stuffed animals and microscopes; the storage trunk of the untamable Tristan contains cartridges for a Sharps buffalo rifle, a rusty handgun of unknown origin, a jar of flint arrowheads, and a bear claw necklace that he probably got from the Cheyenne named One Stab, whom Ludlow often felt was more the boys father than he himself.We learn that the elder Ludlow has mismanaged the secondary life lived through his sons, but it is the brotherly bond, more than any paternal one, that dominates the book, uniting and strangling the three young men. After Samuel is cut down in France by gunfire and mustard gas, Tristan cuts out his little brothers heart (for burial under the Big Sky of home) and then, deranged with grief, scalps several German soldiers, taking care to observe a bit of technique that Harrison passes on to the reader: You couldnt scalp a beheaded man because you needed an anchor to gain a good fulcrum. Tristans later wanderings and outlawry are awash in violence, and the novella sometimes feels ready to crumble beneath all its gunplay and carnage and staginess.And yet Harrison never lets go of several different literary schemas  Celtic, biblical and classical  that seem to frame and discipline the story. The Tristan of legend steals his uncles intended bride for himself; Harrisons Tristan similarly provokes his brothers jealousy by making off with Susannah, the girl Alfred was supposed to marry, although Tristan really desires her only in order to create a replacement child for the dead Samuel. As in the Old Testament, Susannah is spied upon when shes at her bath, and just as allusively, when One Stab picks up the ill-fated Samuels saddle, it is as if he were picking up doom herself, doom always owning the furthest, darkest reaches of the feminine gender. Pandora, Medusa, the Bacchantes, the Furies....The storys narrative voice is arbitrary and godlike, always very distant but by turns lyrical and essayistic, superbly telling instead of showing: Susannahs character owed more to the early 19th than the early 20th century. When the narrator has the future on his mind, he doesnt foreshadow what he can simply foretell: We learn that Tristan will die on a snowy hillside in Alberta late in December in 1977 at the age of 84, nearly 50 pages and more than 50 years before it happens.Not so much world-weary as cosmically tired, Harrisons storytelling is sometimes hushed and sometime sonorous, rolling out on waves of complicated syntax that are averse to commas. This tale of brothers has so much on its mind that the authors choice of the compact novella form seems almost perverse, a kind of stunt. A Tolstoyan view of the world (There is little to tell of happiness  happiness is only itself, placid, emotionally dormant) must also make room for the Cheyenne sense of fatality that what had happened had already happened. By the time Legends of the Fall is finished, it has the reader believing that life is little more than deaths back story.Thomas Mallons eight novels include Henry and Clara, Bandbox, Fellow Travelers and Watergate, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. He has also published nonfiction about plagiarism (Stolen Words), diaries (A Book of Ones Own), letters (Yours Ever) and the Kennedy assassination (Mrs. Paines Garage), as well as two books of essays. His work appears in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly and other publications. A recipient of the Vursell prize of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, for distinguished prose style, he is currently professor of English at George Washington University.  By Leslie JamisonPeople often find incest in The Sound and the Fury, but I saw something else.When I first read William Faulkners The Sound and the Fury, I loved that he wrote about siblings in terms of longing. People often find incest in that book, but I saw something else, a different kind of desire: The desire to stay inside a certain dream of closeness, and the desire to articulate a bond others couldnt easily understand. I read Quentin Compsons famous declaration I have committed incest, Father as a fabrication, perhaps even an imagined one. It wanted a label for an intimacy the world couldnt recognize or protect: the love of a brother who doesnt want to give his sister up to the world beyond the one they shared.In college, when I wrote my senior thesis about siblings in Faulkners work, it seemed to me as if all the critics wanted to read Faulkners siblings in terms of history or political identity  to make their bonds about chivalric obsession with female purity, or else an obsessive allegiance to the South or the past, an unwillingness to move forward into the future  but I wanted to read them as siblings: brothers who didnt want to let their sister go.Why doesnt Caddy get a voice? People asked. It was just her brothers talking about her instead: idiot Benjy, smitten Quentin, bitter Jason. Did you ever have a sister? Did you? Quentin asks, and Faulkner didnt himself. He only had three brothers, which is perhaps why he felt more comfortable writing the sister as imagined by her brothers. And perhaps I loved the novel because it was all about brothers obsessed with their absent sister, and Id spent much of my childhood as a sister obsessed with her absent brothers.People had often told me, It must have been like being an only child, after finding out my two brothers were nine and 10 years older, and I tried a thousand ways to tell them: No, it hadnt been like that at all. It was more like having gods for brothers, who defined me with their presence and then defined me with their absence. When I fought the critics in my thesis, I fought them with an anger I was probably directing at all the people who hadnt understood what my brothers meant to me.But I felt The Sound and the Fury understood something about how our siblings sear into us as children: the vision of a sisters muddy drawers in a tree, or the sound of her name. It got how losing your siblings can get bound up in the loss of certain fantasies: fantasies of innocence or dependence, the fantasy of being totally known by others or totally enmeshed with them. When Quentin looks at a leaf in water and mourns how after a while the tissue will be gone and the delicate fibers ... dont touch one another, no matter how knotted up they once were, no matter how close they lay once to the bones, he is also mourning something else  the possibility of losing a sister who once felt closer than anyone else.I dedicated my thesis to my brothers and concluded  at its close  that absence could yield a shattered kind of empathy, could become somehow honest about incompletion in its splinters. Looking back now, I see my desperate desire to believe that distance could drive closeness rather than making it impossible. I needed to believe that the gaps between me and my brothers were part of our closeness rather than proof we didnt have it. I wanted to believe more broadly in a vision of intimacy that acknowledged all sorts of holes and gaps and ruptures; that wasnt refuted by the distance between people but contoured by it.Thats what I felt Faulkner intuited about siblings: that there were all sorts of gaps and harms and distances that might befall them, that they might inflict on each other, but that they loved each other anyway. Even when they were cruel to each other, or opaque to each other, or imagined each other rather than really hearing each other, they still felt bound to each other  connected beyond all arguments to the contrary.Leslie Jamison is the author of an essay collection, The Empathy Exams, winner of the Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize.

{"text": "A FRIEND of mine complains about how many of the men she meets on Tinder use corporate language to chat her up. First, they reach out. Then, after spending the night together, they follow up.This kind of flirting is banal, but it makes sense. We constantly use economic metaphors to describe romantic and sexual relations. Few people today refer to women as damaged goods or wonder why a man would buy the cow when he can get the milk for free, but we have friends with benefits and invest in relationships. An ex may be on or off the market. Online dating makes shopping around explicit. Blog after blog strategizes about how to maximize your return on investment on OkCupid.We use this kind of language because the ways that people date  who contacts whom, where they meet and what happens next  have always been tied to the economy. Dating applies the logic of capitalism to courtship. On the dating market, everyone competes for him or herself.When parents worry about how their 20-something kids are (or arent) pairing off, or the authors of trend pieces lament the death of courtship, they seem to forget that the pursuit of sex and romance didnt remain unchanged from the moment when the first Homo sapiens sidled across the savanna toward his soul mate until Steve Jobs rolled out the iPhone.If you want to understand why Netflix and chill has replaced dinner and a movie, you need to look at how people work. Today, people are constantly told that we must be flexible and adaptable in order to succeed. Is it surprising that these values are reshaping how many of us approach sex and love?Back when most people punched clocks at fixed hours, a date might have asked Shall I pick you up at 6? But part-timers, contractors and other contingent workers  who constitute some 40 percent of the American work force  are more inclined to text one another u still up? than to make plans in advance. Smartphones have altered expectations about when we are on and off, and working from home or from cafes has blurred the lines between labor and leisure.The average American may not be asking someone out on a date today because he works longer hours than he used to. The 2013 and 2014 Work and Education Poll conducted by Gallup found that the average full-time American worker reported working 47 hours per week. Moreover, 21 percent of the people surveyed reported working 50 to 59 hours per week; and another 18 percent said they worked 60 or more hours a week.And those are just the hours on the clock. They dont include time spent outside normal hours answering emails or maintaining a social media presence  activities that many jobs require. In other words, single people today tend to work longer hours than they would have in the Norman Rockwell, soda-fountain era that many people seem to have in mind when they get misty-eyed about traditional dating. No surprise they have less time and energy left over to go out.In most times and places, matchmaking rituals have been designed to lead to marriage and reproduction. In the case of dating, the goals of your endeavor are less clear. Most single Americans hope to find more than someone to binge-watch Breaking Bad and have sex with (53 percent of never-married Americans still say they want to get married someday), but marriage rates have declined significantly since 1960. The median age of first marriage has risen to a record high: 27 for women and 29 for men.Sometimes social class can make a difference. Growing numbers of working-class Americans are eschewing marriage and having children outside of marriage. In a 2013 study conducted by researchers at Harvard and the University of Virginia, working-class respondents cited low wages and a lack of job security as the primary reasons for these changes.But a high average salary doesnt necessarily mean stable relationships. A 2013 report called Knot Yet: The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America observed that young adults have gone from seeing marriage as a cornerstone of adult life to its capstone, something you enter only after you complete your education and attain professional stability. Until then, you may be better off swiping through Tinder.Still, for all of the challenges, its worth noting that the gig economy has also brought some much-needed flexibility to dating and relationships. Young women today face less pressure to build their lives around marriage and childbearing than their mothers or grandmothers did. If you are gay or lesbian or if you want a relationship that is not monogamous you are likely to meet less resistance than you might have in the past. Still, as the work of dating has become increasingly flexible, it has also become increasingly precarious.DATING itself is a recent invention. It developed when young people began moving to cities and women began working outside private homes. By 1900, 44 percent of single American women worked. Previously, courtship had taken place under adult supervision, in private places: a parlor, a factory dance or church social. But once women started going out and earning wages, they had more freedom over where and how they met prospective mates. Because men vastly out-earned women, they typically paid for entertainment.Today, we refer to a man inviting a woman to dinner as traditional. At first it was scandalous: A woman who arranged to meet a man at a bar or restaurant could find herself interrogated by a vice commission. In the 1920s and 30s, as more and more middle-class women started going to college, parents and faculty panicked over the rating and dating culture, which led kids to participate in petting parties and take joy rides with members of the opposite sex.By the 1950s, a new kind of dating took over: going steady. Popular advice columnist Dorothy Dix warned in 1939 that going steady was an insane folly. But by the post-war era of full employment, this form of courtship made perfect sense. The booming economy, which was targeting the newly flush teen demographic, dictated that in order for everyone to partake in new consumer pleasures  for everyone to go out for a burger and root beer float on the weekends  young people had to pair off. Today, the economy is transforming courtship yet again. But the changes arent only practical. The economy shapes our feelings and values as well as our behaviors.The generation of Americans that came of age around the time of the 2008 financial crisis has been told constantly that we must be flexible and adaptable. Is it so surprising that we have turned into sexual freelancers? Many of us treat relationships like unpaid internships: We cannot expect them to lead to anything long-term, so we use them to get experience. If we look sharp, we might get a free lunch.But for all the hand-wringing, this kind of dating isnt any more transactional than it was back when suitors paid women family-supervised visits or parents sought out a yenta to introduce their children at a synagogue mixer. Courtship has always been dictated by changes in the market. The good news is that dating is not the same thing as love. And as anyone who has ever been in love can attest, the laws of supply and demand do not control our feelings."}

{"text": "On Feb. 14, 1892, the Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst delivered what Daniel Czitrom, a Mount Holyoke College historian, calls the most politically explosive sermon in New York history.Billy McGlorys brothel on East 14th Street operated openly, protected by the police and prosecutors and by the lying, perjured, rum-soaked and libidinous lot who ran New York, Parkhurst said furiously from the pulpit.Within weeks, a Manhattan grand jury, convened to call Parkhursts bluff, rejected his claim. Instead of retreating, however, the dogged Presbyterian minister teamed up with a suburban Republican state senator, Clarence Lexow, marshaled evidence of officially sanctioned vice, and started a decontamination crusade that resonates today in echoes of police brutality and corruption, income inequality, restricted immigration, vote suppression, links between evangelicals and politics and, as Professor Czitrom writes, the nations profound fear and distrust of New York City.In New York Exposed: The Gilded Age Police Scandal That Launched the Progressive Era (Oxford University Press, $27.95), the author describes the Lexow Committee as the first in a cycle of police investigations, perhaps the one that exposed the most pervasive corruption (nearly half the forces captains were implicated) and brought about the least immediate reform (virtually all the criminal cases against the police collapsed).Still, Professor Czitroms evocative account reveals that the nexus between politics, policing and biblical trespasses in the late 19th century introduced the term organized crime, spawned the Patrolmens Benevolent Association, demonstrated the power of mass media and even presaged reality television shows when George Appo, a notorious swindler, and Tom Gould, owner of a disreputable saloon, played themselves when In the Tenderloin opened at a theater on the Bowery.The Lexow Committee found little evidence that the Democratic bosses of Tammany Hall committed vote fraud (the influx of immigrants was enough to supply them with loyal constituents) or profited primarily from vice (their most lucrative investments were from honest graft).New Yorkers eventually soured on Parkhursts crusade. His patrician righteousness against vice came to be seen as bigoted, hypocritical and puritanical. At the trial of Hattie Adams, a brothel owner, her lawyer, the bombastic Abe Hummel, eviscerated the ministers motives in feverishly exploring the citys dens of iniquity and reporting back on nude gambols. It is for you to decide, Hummel told the jury, whether this man went to this house and witnessed that dance for the object which he has stated or to gratify his lustful tendencies by looking on. Adams was convicted; the jury recommended mercy.Samuel Langhorne Clemenss first public lecture, at New Yorks Cooper Union in 1867, was so poorly subscribed that his manager filled the auditorium by donating free tickets to teachers. Three decades later, the writer now known as Mark Twain lost his entire fortune, and he discharged all his debts from the proceeds of a grueling global speaking getaway (during which reports of his death were prematurely anticipated and greatly exaggerated in the New York press).In Chasing the Last Laugh: Mark Twains Raucous and Redemptive Round-the-World Comedy Tour (Doubleday, $30), Richard Zacks, the author of Island of Vice (on Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelts campaign to decontaminate New York), takes readers on a rollicking excursion that includes Elmira, N.Y., and Hartford, where Twain was most prolific, and Manhattan, where he returned home to a heros welcome.Twain expressed concern about the affordability of housing but settled into a pricey townhouse near Washington Square (the same one in which 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg would be fatally beaten by her father in 1987), introduced Winston Churchill at the Waldorf-Astoria and, when suffering from a cold, sportively extorted the finest Scotch as a curative from Andrew Carnegie."}
{"text": "DENVER  Last week, in the middle of the Mets longest trip of the season, Manager Terry Collins was discussing how instant replay had all but eliminated arguments from baseball, a spectacle he seemed to miss.But there are still instances when managers can argue, and even be ejected from a ballgame, and Collins found one on Saturday night during the Mets 7-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.It was a matter of a foul tip  or not a foul tip, as Collins and the Mets saw it  in the third inning, and it proved to be the decisive play in the game.A player who might have been out was instead given a reprieve and hit a two-run double, and the Rockies scored four runs after the disputed play, going on to win by three.It cost us the game, Collins said. End of story.The Rockies had the bases loaded with one out in the third. It was a dicey situation, but Mets starter Logan Verrett still had a reasonable hope of getting out of the jam. The next batter was Tony Wolters, a catcher and the No. 8 hitter, who was batting .172 entering Saturday. Rockies starter Eddie Butler was due up after Wolters.If Verrett could get Wolters, he could easily strand all three runners.Wolters worked the count to 2-2, and then Verrett threw a breaking ball in the dirt. Wolters swung and missed, and the ball skipped into the glove of catcher Kevin Plawecki, apparently for strike three.But Carlos Torres, the home-plate umpire, instantly threw up his hands to call a foul tip, prolonging Wolterss at-bat. Plawecki argued, and Collins quickly trotted out of the dugout to join the protest.The play was not reviewable, so an argument ensued. Collinss temper flared, and Torres ejected him.Torres told Collins that he had heard the bat tip the ball, Collins said. I said, You couldnt have heard it because he didnt foul it off, Collins exclaimed after the game.Collins seemed to have reason to object. Television replays appeared to show that Wolterss bat never touched the ball.Wolters even acknowledged to Plawecki during the at-bat that his bat did not touch the ball, Plawecki said.But he didnt have to tell me, Plawecki added. I knew. Everyone in the ballpark knew, except the guy standing behind me.Asked if Torres said anything else about the play during the course of the game, Plawecki responded, Our line of communication kind of stopped after that.The Mets anger soon turned to dismay. With new life, Wolters, a rookie, worked the count full and then swatted a two-run double to right-center field. It was his second hit of the game and the 12th hit of his young career.And the Rockies were not done. After Butler was out on a bunt attempt, Charlie Blackmon lined a single into right field to score two more runs, and the Rockies led, 7-1.The call was critical, but Verrett did not do a good job of limiting the damage.Poor execution on my part, said Verrett, who, starting in place of the injured Steven Matz, lasted two and two-thirds innings, giving up seven runs and 10 hits and walking three.The Mets began to chip away at the lead. In the fourth, Neil Walker hit his 10th home run, a solo shot, and the Mets scored two more runs in the sixth after Yoenis Cespedes led off with a double.David Wright led off the seventh with a double for his second hit but was stranded. Wright went 2 for 5 and struck out twice, including in the ninth inning against closer Jake McGee.Wright now has 44 strikeouts in 108 at-bats, and he had two hits in his past 24 at-bats before Saturday. Still, his on-base percentage was reasonably healthy over that span, at .353, because he walked 10 times.Collins said Wrights on-base percentage was keeping him from moving Wright out of the second spot in the batting order. But Collins indicated that could be pending.At some point, if he continues to struggle, well address that, Collins said before the game. He leads the team in on-base. When youre talking about the two hole, youre talking about guys getting on base.The hits by Wright were encouraging. But after the game, which left the Mets 4-6 on their trip, the team was more focused on the call that went against them.Its unfair, Collins said. Theres no reason for it."}

{"text": "THE COOK UPA Crack Rock MemoirBy D. Watkins261 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $26.In 1978, after four years away from American shores and the tempest of public furor, the hypnotic, if sometimes unpredictable, singer Nina Simone released her album Baltimore. On the title track, Simone sang of dissonant times in her signature blues-tinged warble: Oh, Baltimore, aint it hard just to live, just to live. Thirty-seven years later, a two-week protest spurred by the death of Freddie Gray  the 25-year-old black man who suffered a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody  seized TV screens across the globe, becoming worldwide news. What links Simones album to the death of Gray and others is the inextricable and exacting thrall of Baltimore, a city that has served as cage and coffin for a legions worth of black residents living in its western, southern and eastern corridors. And because Marylands seaport city figures so commandingly in The Cook Up, the latest book from the writer and educator D. Watkins, one is again reminded of Baltimores sometimes inescapable pull, and how for those wading through its troubled waters, it is often easier to give in than to get out.Baltimore is perhaps best known for its tangled politics and its ever-swelling congregation of illegal drug outfits, thanks to David Simons mid-aughts HBO show The Wire, the haunting urban panorama that lodged itself into the American pop consciousness. This time, though, the citys wickedness  brought on by a trickling stream of bureaucratic failure through the years, from the early days of the 1960s segregationist police force to the more recent accusations of predatory practices among Housing Authority workers  finds a suitable host in Watkinss self-labeled crack rock memoir. In East Baltimore, people are gained, trusted, and loved as quick as they fade.It is important to keep the fade in mind as you traverse Watkinss terrain; its what he fights so forcefully against from the books onset, forgoing acceptance to Georgetown University for a proposition fraught with menace. The plan? To shepherd the drug enterprise of his recently murdered brother, Bip. Quickly fashioning himself into a well-respected player within the neighborhood, he lays claim to Madeira Street, a main artery in the communitys core market. Over time, Watkins becomes known for serving the finest Rockafella (the neighborhood moniker for top-shelf crack cocaine) to an assortment of scabby-faced fiends, former athletes, single moms and 9-to-5ers. But as business booms  steeples of cash, silver-rimmed luxury cars and women are all in abundance at one point  the sting of trauma, and the manner in which its venom slowly overtakes the body, becomes unbearable for Watkins.I never set out to be a part of that life, Watkins writes of drug dealing early on, but that never stopped that life from setting out to be a part of me. When you are black in America, fighting against the fade  that is to say: battling against erasure  sometimes means doing things you would not otherwise do. That is the nature of trauma: It bleeds out in all directions. For Watkins, the pain of losing his brother propels him into a world where drugs are both profit and prescription. At only 18, he is self-medicating with marijuana, Percocet and vodka, struggling with depression while navigating the thick haze of street politics.After a handful of fateful encounters, Watkins resolves to flip his hustle entirely. He transitions from corner dealing to wholesale supply, weans off Percs, buys a bar with the money hes amassed and moves into a house in Bolton Hill with Soni, an Afrocentric woman with Scotch-colored skin whom hes fallen in love with. Only later does he let go of it all and return to East Baltimore on the path to purpose, becoming an educator with a deep love for books by Langston Hughes and Sister Souljah. His decision is provoked by the brutal death of friends and the possible reality of jail time. I could give back to the neighborhoods that my friends and I tore apart, he writes, eyes wide with hope.Beyond identifying some of the books technical faults, its hard to offer a critique of Watkinss account. Although the Los Angeles of my formative years was also peppered with instability, bloodshed and gang rivalry, it was worlds different from Baltimore at the close of the 1990s. And because storytelling can function as catharsis for black writers, there is a measure of value in the books publication. Our stories, after all, were not always voiced by us. Words, for me and, I assume, for Watkins, are a means to personal deliverance. Other reviewers, those looking to feed a particular narrative about inner city African-Americans, might have been tempted to label his story gritty or his writing street polished, but that would have misinterpreted his testimony, offering a shallow and one-sided distortion.This is why, as readers and as critics, we must mine deeper. I could have written at length about Watkinss lean, casual prose and how it was difficult to sustain throughout; situations often skyrocket unexpectedly or plunge without much explanation. But I would have missed the books larger aim. The thread that connects The Cook Up with the authors previous true-to-life treatise, The Beast Side: Living (and Dying) While Black in America, and with his columns for Salon is, to me, of greater importance: It is Watkinss belief in the telling of black stories, in their ugliness and in their beauty. I was depressed with my friends and the decisions they were making, he admits in the closing pages. I couldnt do anything to save any of them. Oh, Baltimore."}
{"text": "Here are the weeks top stories, and a look ahead.1. The Obama administration made its stance on transgender rights clear to public schools across the country, sending a letter telling districts to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. The directive isnt a law, but the threat of lawsuits or loss of federal aid is implicit. The move came at the end of a week that also saw the Justice Department and North Carolina sue one another over access to public restrooms._____2. Donald Trump dominated campaign news, both in political maneuvering on Capitol Hill and seamier stories  like a former butler threatening to lynch President Obama and his contradictory relationships with women. The sheer volume of such reports may be dulling their impact. He moves so quick and creates outrages so fast, you almost forget what happened, a Republican strategist said._____3. On the Democratic side of the presidential contest, some supporters of Bernie Sanders are working on a proposal that he suspend his campaign after the June 7 California primary, concede to Hillary Clinton and use his popularity to focus his efforts on helping defeat Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Sanders rejected the idea._____4. The leadership struggle in Brazil turned decisive, as the Senate suspended President Dilma Rousseff to try her for fiscal skullduggery. The move could push the country, a bastion of the South American left, farther to the right._____5. Did Russia cheat to be the top medal-winner at the 2014 Olympics at Sochi? A former Russian official said he had overseen a vast doping program, years in the making, and that at Sochi, his team was able to access urine samples through a hole in a wall, open supposedly tamper-proof Swiss-made bottles and replace dozens of athletes tainted samples with clean urine. Russia denounced the account._____6. Years of debate within the White House ended in an announcement that, yes, President Obama would visit Hiroshima. In less than two weeks, he will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit the memorial to the victims of the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Japan in World War II. The two countries, now allies, still tend to see the other as failing to fully accept its responsibility._____7. Forget the fountain of youth: Scientists are working on a second skin to erase the effects of aging. The invisible film has been successful, in small studies, at making undereye bags vanish and wrinkles disappear, as on the left above. It might also be used to treat eczema, psoriasis and other skin conditions, researchers say._____8. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised federal money to help rebuild the Canadian city of Fort McMurray, which was nearly destroyed by a wildfire. Damage estimates rise into the billions of dollars. Fires have been ravaging vast swaths of boreal forests in northern latitudes around the world, with climate change often a major factor._____9. Time for a bit of greener news: Researchers are restoring Emily Dickinsons beloved gardens at her home in Amherst, Mass. She died 130 years ago today, and her extensive flower and vegetable fields, along with an orchard and greenhouse, were removed by later owners. She once wrote: Some keep the Sabbath going to Church  / I keep it, staying at Home  / With a Bobolink for a Chorister  / And an Orchard, for a Dome._____10. An extraordinary bank heist: For a second time, thieves penetrated the Swift global financial messaging system, apparently targeting a commercial bank in Vietnam. A few months ago, digital robbers got away with $81 million from Bangladeshs central bank, above. In both cases, the thieves used real network credentials  suggesting the possibility of insider accomplices  and hid their actions behind malware._____11. Finally, a sweet note. Japan just loves Kit Kat. There are nearly 300 varieties (including Adzuki Bean and Wasabi) and you can find them in high-end department stores and Kit-Kat-only specialty shops. And at least for a few weeks last year, a single stick coated with gold leaf was being sold.Have a great week._____Karen Workman contributed reporting.Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And dont miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?

{"text": "NEW ORLEANS  When Chen Marshall got into a fight in high school, she assumed she might be suspended. Instead, the police arrested her.Then a 17-year-old junior with no criminal record, she did not realize that Louisiana was in the dwindling minority of states where all 17-year-olds are treated as adults by the criminal justice system.She was charged with battery, with bail set at $5,000. She was booked and clothed in a jumpsuit at the Orleans Parish Prison, a notoriously violent facility where she bunked along with women of all ages and histories.I had a fight that first night, she recalled of her jailing in 2011. Its called testing your weight, to see if youre scared or they can own you.She spent three nights in the jail before her great-aunt, who had raised her from infancy, could come up with a bondsmans $650 fee and secure her release.Seventeen-year-olds cannot vote, buy cigarettes or even adopt a dog from an animal shelter. But as of today, in nine states, including Louisiana, they are automatically handled as adults, rather than as juveniles. In two states, New York and North Carolina, 16-year-olds are as well.Now Louisiana and several other states among those nine appear to be on the verge of raising the cutoff to the more standard age of 18  part of a national raise the age movement that has won bipartisan support, a result of concern about high incarceration rates and growing neurological evidence that young peoples brains are different from adult brains.A bill to phase in the higher age passed the Republican-dominated Louisiana Senate on May 2, has the strong support of Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and now appears to be moving forward in the House.A similar measure appears to be on the verge of adoption by the South Carolina Legislature.Here in Louisiana, the change could alter the lives of close to 5,000 17-year-olds who are arrested each year, mainly for nonviolent misdemeanors. Under the new law, even if they were given prolonged stays in juvenile facilities, they could receive therapy and a chance for high school degrees rather than criminal records and exposure to hardened criminals.To allay concerns that the states juvenile system, already caught in a severe budget crisis, is not prepared for an influx, the bill would phase in the change, with nonviolent offenders making the switch in 2018, and the rest in 2020, said Josh Perry, executive director of the Louisiana Center for Childrens Rights, which provides public defenders for children and has lobbied for the bill.As in other states, prosecutors would retain the option to transfer juveniles who commit particularly serious crimes into adult courts.In the peak tough on crime years of the 1990s, many states acted to send more young offenders to adult courts. But in the last seven years, Illinois and Connecticut increased the age for automatic treatment as adults to 18 from 16, and Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Mississippi raised it to 18 from 17.The experience in those states has bolstered the case for change, said Vincent Schiraldi, a senior research fellow in criminal justice at Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government and a former justice official in New York City and Washington, D.C.While the declining crime rate makes comparisons difficult, evidence suggests that treating 17-year-old offenders as juveniles may reduce public costs over time, he said, because they are less likely to commit future crimes than youths who are punished as adults. Fears that crime would rise or detention facilities would be overwhelmed have proved incorrect.Officials in Connecticut, Illinois and Vermont are even discussing raising the cutoff to 21, though this is more widely disputed. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has proposed raising the age for adult culpability to 18, but members of the Republican-controlled Senate have expressed concerns about transitional costs as well as public safety.In Lafayette, La., Rob Reardon, the director of corrections for the parish, explained why he thought that both the state and the young offenders would be helped by treating 17-year-olds as juveniles.This is an adult jail, he said, and the outcomes for the young people just have to be terrible.On a recent day, the parish jail held one female and eight male 17-year-olds, awaiting adjudication for crimes that ranged from trespassing to murder.When they spend a few weeks in his jail, Mr. Reardon said  and for those who cannot make bail, it is often 90 days or more  youths are expelled from school and never graduate.The presence of 17-year-olds is also a major resource strain, he said. Inmates generally live in pods of 13 cells with double bunks, or 26 to a pod. According to a federal law (one that has frequently been violated in New Orleans), youths must be kept separate, so one entire pod was occupied by just the eight 17-year-old boys, who were tended 24 hours a day by a guard. The 17-year-old girl was housed alone in a unit with four cells.The separation also means that the youngest inmates cannot take part in activities like kitchen work. In the youth pod in Lafayette, guards had brought in coloring books and jigsaw puzzles to give the boys something to do.In New Orleans, Ms. Marshall, now 22, was lucky in some ways after her arrest.A judge allowed her to enter a diversion program; if she attended an anger management class, stayed drug free and continued in school, the criminal charge would be dropped.She finished high school the next year. But now, five years later, she still lives with her great-aunt, Yolanda Wills, in east New Orleans, where a mantel in their home is filled with Ms. Marshalls high school athletic trophies.Ms. Wills, a retired school bus driver living on disability, said she was taken aback when the police arrested Ms. Marshall and then was frustrated by what followed.They said that if she goes through the program, theyd clear her record, Ms. Wills said.But it didnt go anywhere, she said.What Ms. Wills and Ms. Marshall did not realize was that, while the criminal charge disappeared, the arrest record remained.Ms. Marshall said that because of that record, she has repeatedly been turned down for jobs  as a superstore clerk, as a security guard and as a postal worker, among others.She learned only recently from a public defender that her arrest record could be expunged  for $500 in fees.Ms. Wills does not have the extra cash, and Ms. Marshall has no way to earn it.I cant pay to expunge the record, and I cant get a job to get the money, she said."}
{"text": "Dan Feig, 59, had just begun his early-morning rounds in the fish market when a man with a longshoremans hook sidled up and discreetly described a sweet shipment of sea bass.I got a beautiful box over there, the best you ever seen, but you better hurry up, he told Mr. Feig, who was soon sizing up the catch.They dont come any better than that, pal, the man said, trying to hook Mr. Feig, one of the biggest fish buyers here at the New Fulton Fish Market Cooperative at Hunts Point in the Bronx.Mr. Feig picked up a bass and saw from the translucent sheen and bulging eyes that it was fresh. He wiped his fish-slimy hands on his vest and said hed take the box.Mr. Feig, whose business card identifies him as a Fourth Generation Fulton Fish Market Fishmonger, has been making his living by buying and selling fish ever since going to work at age 17 at the Fulton Fish Market in Lower Manhattan. The market was moved in 2005 up to this cavernous terminal in the Bronx, where the buying begins after midnight each weekday and is largely over before dawn.Mr. Feig arrives at the market by 1 a.m. daily and begins buying for F. Rozzo & Sons, a wholesale distributor in the meatpacking district that sells to many of the finest restaurants and hotels in Manhattan.He fills a box truck, sometimes two, with maybe 10,000 pounds of fish a day, to be trucked down to Rozzo & Sons, which is run by Louis Rozzo, whose great-grandfather, Felix Rozzo, started the company in 1900.You cant find too many people who know the fish business and the market like Danny, Mr. Rozzo said. Hes buying for places like Le Bernardin and Daniel and the Four Seasons and the Carlyle, and he knows we need high-quality product.A heavyset man, Mr. Feig plods cheerfully through the market, as forklifts whiz closely by with crates of iced-down seafood.Theres a world of fish in here, he said, stopping at one stand. Thats dogfish, which is used in England for fish and chips. You got monkfish right out the water off Long Island. You got pompano, in from Florida.Mr. Feig estimates that he buys $1 million worth of fish a month at the market, but that is not the only reason he is continuously courted by sellers at their stalls. He has worked with many of them for decades. He greets the sellers with gibes. He tastes their raw tuna, sniffs their scallops, has them open oyster after oyster so he can eye them.This is my home  were part of a family here, said Mr. Feig, who does not mind the chilly temperature in the market, nor the fish smell, nor the ungodly hours.After all, he said, compared with the old outdoor Fulton market, This is paradise.This is beautiful, he said. Theres no rain, no snow. The ground is level.But it lacks the central location of the old Fulton market, said Mr. Feig, who is married with two grown children and lives in West Nyack, N.Y. Nor does it have the lore. Yes, there are characters here, but not like Bo, the fish loader at Fulton Street with a glass eye. Hed tell buyers hed keep an eye on their boxes of fish, and then take out his eye and put it on the box, said Mr. Feig, who sat on a packing crate and whipped out his notebook, which is protected by a metal binder to prevent the fish guts from soaking through.Mr. Feig said he grew up in public housing in the Gun Hill section of the Bronx and began working summers at the fish market, where his grandfather sold shrimp in the summer and shad in the winter, on South Street.He said he became adept at slicing shad to remove the roe. His speed  about 500 fish, or 2,000 pounds, an hour  was so impressive that he would challenge any two cutters at the market to keep up with him. Mr. Feig said his uncle once won $1,000 backing him in a race against a pair of cutters.Mr. Feig eventually became a seller himself, and a fish importer, and would travel abroad seeking new types of fish to market in New York.In the market, his phone rings nonstop, even at 2 a.m. Mr. Feig calls around constantly, checking prices with wholesalers and fishermen. There are no formally set market prices, and rates can vary and change even during the course of a morning at the market. So Mr. Feig is constantly asking sellers their prices, and about their current and incoming supply.During his recent rounds, a seller offered him black sea bass for $10 a pound but soon lowered his price to $7.50. Mr. Feig bought some but saved his money. I got a guy whos selling it right now for $6.85, down the other end, he said."}
{"text": "HOW WOMEN DECIDEWhats True, Whats Not, and What Strategies Spark the Best ChoicesBy Therese Huston373 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $28.Therese Huston recounts a story at the beginning of How Women Decide that illustrates the ways in which womens decisions can be perceived very differently from mens. In February 2013, Yahoos new chief executive, Marissa Mayer, announced that the company was eliminating its full-time work-from-home policy because she wanted her employees to interact more closely. There was an explosion of criticism as columnists and commentators decried her move, claiming it was particularly hostile to working mothers. Even the founder of Virgin Group, Richard Branson, took time from running his conglomerate to chime in, writing on his company website: Yours truly has never worked out of an office, and never will. Three years later, people still talk about it.Would it shock you to learn that about a week after Mayers headline-grabbing corporate policy shift, the chief executive of Best Buy, Hubert Joly, made the same change? And that it attracted only a fraction of the attention? Although one can argue about the merits of telecommuting, the responses to the two executive orders were telling. For making the same judgment call, Huston writes, a male C.E.O. drew some sidelong glances for a few months, but a female C.E.O. drew extensive scrutiny and censure for years.Huston uses this anecdote and others to demonstrate something most women in the professional world learn as soon as they report for their very first job in a freshly pressed Banana Republic suit: Theres an enormous double standard when it comes to how men and women are perceived as decision-makers, and those differences can hamper much more than a womans career. One obstacle is the common perception that women are indecisive, encumbered by their need to build consensus, weighed down by a lack of self-confidence and an inability to handle stress. The fact that Hustons book even exists reinforces this point. Imagine, for a moment, an alternate universe in which it was felt necessary to publish a book titled How Men Decide that dissected the male decision-making process. The very idea is laughable. Everyone knows that men simply stride onto the battlefield, survey the landscape and charge. Even if they flame out, they usually get credit for trying.Using a wealth of economic and social science research, Huston  a cognitive psychologist who teaches at Seattle University  documents these stereotypes and shows how women are often trapped in situations where they cant come out ahead, no matter what they do. Both voters and workers, for example, want their leaders to be decisive, but those same groups penalize women if they dont seem sufficiently collaborative, only to criticize them if they appear too reliant on the opinions of others. Huston punctures many of these myths, citing research that suggests most men struggle over big decisions just as much as women do. Helpfully, at the end of each chapter she offers practical suggestions to counteract stereotypes concerning decision-making, not just for women but for anyone in a position to hire and promote both women and men.Packed with studies and references, Hustons book can at times seem like an instruction manual. Yet it will resonate with any women trying to navigate treacherous career waters, as well as with managers wondering how to increase diversity and get the best out of all their employees. One could also imagine it becoming required reading on Wall Street, where male-dominated thinking has caused so many problems.During challenging periods, men and women will often make different choices, and the evidence shows that groups come to better conclusions when there are more women involved. These counterbalancing reactions mean that to make good decisions under stressful conditions, we need both men and women in the room, and both need to be heard, Huston writes. Neuroscientists know about these biases, but investment bankers probably dont."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO  The dining room for the athletes village at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics will be bigger than two football fields, and the kitchen being built in the same enormous tent will be as large as one.The setting hints at quite a spread when the games open in just under three months.We want to make sure when there is a medal or a record, part of that record also goes to our food team, said Marcello Cordeiro, Rios director of food and beverages.At its peak, the athletes village kitchen will prepare 60,000 meals a day, produced from daily shipments of 460,000 pounds of raw ingredients  all served up on four million biodegradable plates for 18,000 athletes, coaches and staff members.Diners will choose from five buffets: Brazilian; Asian; International; Pasta and Pizza; and Halal and kosher.Food for Muslim and Jewish athletes will adhere to their specific religious dietary laws. Koreans will even get spicy kimchi  the nations famous dish of fermented cabbage, scallions and assorted vegetables  shipped directly from home.And everyone can try 40 varieties of Brazils exotic fruits like caju, acai, carambola, caqui, goiaba and maracuja, often squeezed into Brazils delicious juices (sucos in Portuguese).The subsequent Paralympics will offer the same variety, though the numbers will be smaller.We are confident our Brazilian food is going to be a success, Cordeiro said. Well make a bit more to be safe. We are doing our best to bring the world to Brazil.He listed key ingredients of the basic Brazilian diet: rice, black beans, farofa (flour from toasted cassava often sprinkled on top of food) and meat. But the regional specialties are as diverse as the continent-size country itself.Buffet-style eateries are popular in Brazil, where they charge by the weight  so-called kilo restaurants. There will be no charge for the athletes. They can eat all they want. Cordeiro said.To prepare the final menus, Cordeiro and colleagues are holding about 20 food testings before the Olympics open Aug. 5. Theyve been through seven or eight already, including one a few days ago.Imagine you start eating at 10 a.m. and you finish 8 p.m., Cordeiro said. Everyone thinks that food-tasting is super-duper, but this is how you eat.He demonstrated, lifting a tiny sandwich slice up to his nose, one made of ham, mozzarella, cream cheese and lettuce. He checked for texture and presentation, and finally took a small bite. Next he graded the offering on a checklist.Ill tell you the truth, I cant stand the testing, he said. This means eating the whole day. Actually, not eating. Tasting. You bite and you leave it.Rio will also offer different breakfast styles. For Japanese athletes, there might be rice and miso soup, or fish and natto, the gooey, pungent paste made from fermented soybeans.Were also very careful with the spice, Cordeiro said.The athletes village consists of 31 apartment towers containing 10,160 bedrooms. It is just one part of the Olympic food operation. Deborah Cordiner is handling most of the rest, including athletes food at venues, and support centers for volunteers and accredited guests.We always face the same challenges, the transport, the volume of food, said Cordiner, a Scot who has worked at all but two Olympics this century.She said athletes at venues would munch on tens of thousands of sandwiches.A spokesman for the organizing committee declined to give the names of catering companies under contract, saying they are not sponsors, so they dont have a right to be associated with the Games.Organizers receive billions of dollars from sponsors like McDonalds, the International Olympic Committee said.Cordeiro said he worried less about the menu  he has about 20 chefs, several from outside Brazil  than about food safety. He must guarantee the food is free from steroids or other ingredients that might cause an athlete to test positive on a doping test.A major offender is the steroid Clenbuterol, which is fed to livestock in some countries to produce leaner meat.To assure that our ingredients are free of steroids and other kinds of chemicals, we are making sure our suppliers have all the certificates that are demanded by our national food and drug agency, Cordeiro said.He said almost all the food was coming from Brazil, save for items like kimchi and some spices.Athletes will be forbidden to take their own food into the dining area, though many will eat away from the village  often in training areas set up by their national teams.If an athlete brings something in from outside and eats it the dining hall and gets sick, then it can be blamed on the village food, Cordeiro said. But in the end, we know that athletes can go anywhere and buy a hot dog and possibly get it inside."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Nothing in this room is off the record, Juleanna Glover, a corporate consultant, warned the stragglers assembled in the kitchen of her Kalorama home as Steve Hilton, a former chief adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, hunted for a beer.It was the evening after Donald Trump had effectively sewn up the Republican nomination; the nights conversations had been dominated by talk of polls and power.Mr. Hilton is credited as the architect of a modernized British Conservative image  one that supports gay marriage, and countering climate change  that helped get Mr. Cameron elected. An outsiders insider, in other words.Mr. Hilton, and his ideas, had spent the week debuting here in Washington. Appearances were made at White House Correspondents Association dinner parties, on MSNBCs Morning Joe, and at the American Enterprise Institute. Meetings were held with a whos who of American conservatives, including Grover Norquist and Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman.This final evening was a party for Mr. Hiltons book, More Human: Designing a World Where People Come First, a call for smaller-scaled living and governance. (A British edition of the book received mixed reviews. It was largely revised for its American publication.)The night had started five hours earlier.Mr. Hilton, who has a closely shaved head, faintly bounced into the dining room. He was clad, as always, in a T-shirt (this one was black, festooned with white flecks that appeared, at a distance, to be stars), blue corduroys and red-striped white sneakers that bore the label Crowdpac  the nonpartisan political-crowd-funding site that Mr. Hilton founded with two partners.On his wrist he wore a tattered aqua bracelet embroidered with the word Coachella. Four years ago, Mr. Hilton decamped London for California, where his wife, Rachel Whetstone, was the chief of public policy and communications for Google; she is now in the same position at Uber. (In contrast, Mr. Hilton is decidedly low-tech; he does not carry a cellphone.)The room quickly filled with journalists, pollsters and think-tank pundits. A C-Span cameraman jostled for position.Such an illustrious crew  it reminds me of something, Mr. Hilton said, as guests pressed up against a table laden with sushi. He began to read: When the corporate bosses, the members of Congress, the journalists  and the authors of books like this  all go to the same dinner parties and galas and live in the same neighborhoods of Washington, New York and San Francisco, an insular ruling elite precipitates.  Regardless of whos in office, the same people are in power.Its great to see you all here, he deadpanned, looking up. The crowd laughed.Mr. Hilton said that his book calls for radical change, from top-down government (more power to ultralocal, neighborhood government) to schools (no factory schools, a reconsideration of testing). A single social worker, for example, for a family in need.It opens with an anecdote about a JetBlue flight trapped on the tarmac and regulations that required a mother to deny her young daughter the bathroom. Mr. Hilton, the son of Hungarians who fled Communism, invoked Hannah Arendt and inhuman systems, before turning to questions.Who are the enemies of your ideas? Steve Clemons of The Atlantic asked.Mr. Hilton spoke about decentralizing concentrations of power, including, perhaps, breaking up banks, health insurance, giant agriculture and telecom companies.A British compatriot, Richard Reeves, who was the director of strategy for the former British Deputy Prime Minister (and Liberal Democrat) Nick Clegg, spoke up. The people you want to give power to arent in the structure at the moment and dont have a locus to bring about change, he said.Mr. Hilton vigorously agreed. The book, he said, calls for new blood in office. He segued into a pitch for Crowdpac, which allows for fund-raising without depending on big party machinery which traps people in the existing power structures.Mr. Reeves, now at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Hilton was one of the most vibrant thinkers on the center right in British politics. The book, he added, authentically captures not just his political philosophy but his moral philosophy, which is that the bigness and centralized expertise of the modern state and the modern company is something he instinctively rebels against. He is hard to pin down politically.Standing near a stack of books for sale, Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist and MSNBC commentator, recalled meeting Mr. Hilton in California when Mr. Hilton was looking at Arnold Schwarzenegger, a fiscally conservative, socially tolerant and environmentally conscious governor as a model for how to rethink the right of center party in the U.K.Asked about Mr. Trump, Mr. Schmidt said that voters, have turned to someone to be nominee for president with no government experience, no military experience, as an act of condemnation against the establishment. Its a line that echoes More Human. Mr. Hilton, he said, had a message of hope.Tammy Haddad, a media strategist and one of the partys co-hosts, arrived late, with a whoop of joy. She shook back her mane of black hair with its singular white stripe and swept Mr. Hilton into a hug.Ms. Haddad, who consults for the HBO show Veep, barreled into a story about The Thick of It, the British precursor to Veep. So you have to watch it  what happens is the whole season is an election, in the U.K., she said. The weekend before the voting, Ms. Haddad continued, the campaign manager of the winning candidate, a character reportedly inspired by Mr. Hilton, has everyone go to a yoga retreat. And then I meet Steve and Im like: Oh, my God! Its the guy. Hes exactly the guy.Scott and Jason Bade, twins, and Mr. Hiltons co-authors (he taught them as undergraduates at Stanford), protested. Hes much more serious, Scott said. Ms. Haddad looked over at them. Youre not in politics, she said. It wasnt goofy, it was the opposite. It was confidence.It was then that the final stragglers assembled in Ms. Glovers kitchen. Around the marble center island were Heather Podesta, the lobbyist and art collector; Ms. Haddad; and Betsy Fischer Martin, a former producer of Meet the Press.To Steve, who is bringing the heart back into politics! Ms. Haddad said. And to being authentic.Lovely, Mr. Hilton said.Oh, Ms. Haddad added, and please subscribe. Betsy and I have a podcast. The whole room laughed.We are, Mr. Hilton noted, in America."}
{"text": "Most of the restaurants Ive visited over the years have been fairly easy to characterize. Of course, every classic bistro, burger joint, fine-dining parlor and Neapolitan pizzeria is distinct; still, nearly all tend to embrace (at least loosely) certain identifiable aesthetics. Its rare to find a tapas bar with the look and feel of a sushi joint, or a sceney bote that could be mistaken for a family-friendly cafe.So its slightly puzzling to come across a restaurant like Harvest Wine Bar, in New Haven, which defies obvious categorization. Despite its name, and the presence of a barroom serving a nice selection of vintages, its not really a wine bar. Its menu includes many house-made pastas and traditional Italian dishes, but its not a strictly Mediterranean place, either. And though the restaurants website describes its philosophy as farm to fork and includes a list of local growers that supply its ingredients, it does not quite fit the farm-to-table niche. Rather, it seems that Harvest aims to straddle all of these classifications.In many respects, the restaurant succeeds, though its a tricky balancing act, and one made even more challenging by the space Harvest Wine Bar occupies. Subterranean, and reachable only by elevator from a Chapel Street building foyer or stadium-style concrete stairs, the L-shaped layout features low, paneled ceilings, minimalist wood and leather dcor, dim lighting and cement walls that  at least at night  conspire to evoke a rather stylishly kitted-out bomb shelter. (During the day, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a brick plaza brighten things up.)The clubby, bunkerlike vibe, complete with throbbing pop soundtrack, works better in the adjacent barroom, which gets packed with evening hordes, but it doesnt exactly suggest the farmhouse.The cuisine is much more adept than the atmosphere at cultivating a locavore feel. Several of the dishes my companions and I liked best highlighted seasonal produce, including two preparations made with fresh spring peas  a bright-green, mint-infused soup and a plate of delicate pea ravioli with thyme butter sauce  and two more (an appetizer and a seared yellowfin tuna entree) featuring lightly crisped artichoke hearts. A spicy salmon tartare, spiked with shreds of jalapeo and accompanied by a peppery pile of arugula leaves, was also wonderfully fresh, and segments of artisanal bison, rabbit and wild boar sausage were herbaceous and deeply flavorful, though they appeared to have been randomly flung onto the plate.Other dishes, especially interpretations of Italian classics, werent quite as on-target. House-made ricotta gnocchi were gummy in texture and served in a Bolognese sauce that tasted strongly and unpleasantly of cinnamon (one friend, an experienced cook from an Italian family, pointed out that there should be a hint of the spice, but not a wallop). A main course of chicken Scarpariello, likewise, was flavored so overwhelmingly with garlic and roasted peppers that the meat seemed like an afterthought. And hand-pulled pappardelle, which would have been marvelous if its sausage and broccoli rabe components had been better balanced, suffered from too hefty a dose of the bitter greens.Wilson Siguenza, who co-owns Harvest along with his brother Cristian Siguenza and his cousins Vicente, Nube and Kleber Siguenza, said that though the restaurants concept is based on local sourcing, it still strives for broad appeal. Besides the New Haven location, which opened in 2014, the family runs outposts in Westport and Greenwich, and three other Fairfield county restaurants.We consider our cuisine New American, Mr. Siguenza said. For us, that means we can offer a little of everything. We can do Italian, we can do French, we can do Spanish, and it all works together.My companions and I mostly agreed. In the end, however, we found the dining experience at Harvest akin to the dessert of slightly melted pistachio and salted-caramel ice cream we shared there one afternoon: satisfying, but a bit muddled."}

He is also an adjunct professor at the school of foreign service at Georgetown.He graduated with first-class honors from Trinity College in Dublin, and received a Master of Science in Economics in comparative politics from the London School of Economics, as well as a Ph.D. in politics and public policy from Princeton. He is a son of Mary E. Healy and Nicholas J. Healy of Dublin.The couple met on a bitterly cold evening in Washington in February 2013, when she bumped into a mutual friend who was with Mr. Healy. It was so cold that you couldnt register a persons face, Ms. Jeng said.Three months later, she was out for drinks with another mutual friend, Michael Strauss, when she told him about how hard it was meeting anyone interesting. Minutes later, unprompted, Mr. Healey sent Mr. Strauss a text inviting him to join him and his old Princeton roommate for dinner a couple of blocks away. Mr. Strauss invited Ms. Jeng along.At first, she was put off by Mr. Healys sense of humor. He was telling a horrific story and chuckling, she said. It was a painful story, but soon I learned thats how the Irish show their pain, through their laughter.The conversation soon got on more entertaining footing, and when Mr. Strauss called it a night, Mr. Healy and his former college roommate persuaded Ms. Jeng to continue the evening with them at a bar across the street, where she regaled them with descriptions of her highly unorganized bookshelf.We then convinced her that we should clean up her bookshelf, said Mr. Healy, and in the wee hours after the bar closed, they walked her home. Along the way a large rat darted out of the bushes and nearly across Ms. Jengs feet.She jumped into my arms, said Mr. Healy, who recalled thinking, Oh shes interested in me. As promised, he and his friend organized her bookshelf before she kicked them out around 3:30 a.m.They began dating regularly, but a few months later she took on a half-year job assignment in Switzerland, which turned into a long-distance relationship of almost two years. I was Penelope back in Greek myth making my tapestries waiting for her to come back, he said, though they did manage to see each other every two or three months.During a vacation to India in August 2015, he proposed during a 10-course dinner on their balcony in Agra with the Taj Mahal before them in the distance.It was a feast for Mughal emperors, she said, and after she accepted, a member of the staff lit a red paper lantern outside, which floated to the sky."}

{"text": "On a busy Saturday night at a restaurant, I was waiting to use the ladies room. (The place has two single-occupancy bathrooms: one for men and one for women.) A minute later, a young man in his 20s came out of the ladies room. Annoyed at his entitlement, I said, Excuse me? To which, he (in regular mens clothing) responded, Im transitioning, and kept walking. I found this rude. I dont believe for a second that he was transgender. My husband suggested I let this go. I disagree. You?BETTY, WESTPORT, CONN.Even I am forced to agree with husbands occasionally, Betty. And if a third is, indeed, the charm, we could probably get Senator Ted Cruz to confirm that its a bad bet to place all your chips on birth-gender bathrooms. Sensitivity is the better play.Your instincts may be right. The young man may have been glib and used the ladies room because he didnt feel like waiting for the mens room, delaying your use of the facilities by 90 seconds. Or, this young person may, in fact, be transitioning. Lets assume she is. (Note: She is not required to wear a Chanel suit or conform to any of your ideas of femininity to be doing so.) Her gender identification is none of our business.Worse, would you risk being wrong? If you were, confronting the young woman at her table (or even reporting her to the manager) may end up hurting her feelings and embarrassing you (not to mention your poor husband). When there is room for doubt, apply the test of lesser evils. It points to keeping quiet in this case.My husbands brother and wife converted from Roman Catholic to Episcopalian a few years ago. Theyve asked my husband to be the godfather of their new baby, their third. We asked if it was O.K., since we are Catholics, and they told us it was no problem. But we checked canon law, which says it is not O.K., since the whole point of being godparents is to ensure that the baby is brought up properly in the faith. Is there a way to respond that wont betray our religion or threaten family relationships?M.L.I have enough godchildren to field a (pretty lousy) production of A Chorus Line. But Im fairly certain that none of their parents imagine that I will board their children or take them to church (shout-out to Hozier!) in the event of tragedy. To me, it seems as if dear friends invited me to join more closely in the celebration of their family. Its been my privilege to accept, and I love these kids  or most of them.This is not to belittle your religious concern. But in the 21st century, your husbands brother and his wife probably have a separate plan for custody of their children in the event of their death. They wont be dealt out by dint of who gave which child the requisite Tiffany rattle. But even if the worst-case plan is for you to take custody (and oversee the religious education) of the baby, is it so hard to envision Sunday school at the Episcopal Church?They are expressing love for your husband. Id encourage him to accept it. Now isnt the time for playing what if? games with tragic outcomes. Life has a way of meting out enough of those.My family is friends with another family. My husband works with the wife, and we go on vacation with them one weekend a year. Recently, said wife threw my husband under the bus at work to achieve a professional goal. (She doesnt know that my husband knows.) It wasnt a major disaster but unpleasant enough that we no longer want to be friends. Unfortunately, I had already reserved the condo for our long weekend and invited them to join us. Are we entitled to disinvite them?ANONYMOUSTreachery trumps travel plans. Just be direct about it. It will save you bristling at future overtures and whines about We never see you anymore! Say: We were disappointed by Sallys behavior at Johns expense. Wed prefer that you not join us in August. Now, Sally may apologize (or try to talk her way out of it). And depending on her sincerity and your affection for the family, the ball will be in your court. But a clean and honest break minimizes the going-forward drama.A year ago, I was friendly with a woman I met through a mutual friend. We were new in town and had a few dinners together. But over time, she began canceling our plans, saying, Tomorrow doesnt work, but lets reschedule. She has canceled every rescheduled plan for eight months. Recently, I ran into her at yoga. She said, Lets do drinks, but never followed up. How should I respond to these empty requests?KATHERINESmile and say, Call me (which will never happen). Theres no upside for you in scolding a semi-stranger over her social insincerity, and even less so in wasting time chasing after her with your datebook."}
{"text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C.  For 14 years, they seemed made for each other: affable, glad-handing Mayor Pat, and this city, North Carolinas largest and a place long defined more by entrepreneurial hustle and economic success than ideology and hard-edge politics.These days, it is not entirely clear whether Pat McCrory, the Republican who was mayor from 1995 to 2009, or Charlotte, which Mr. McCrory is now feuding with as North Carolinas governor, has changed more. But it is apparent that the antidiscrimination ordinance that Charlotte sought to change this year and the successful effort by Mr. McCrory and state lawmakers to block the modification have left both the city and its former mayor reeling and distant.With social issues, you never satisfy the litmus test of either the right or the left, Mr. McCrory said over a Styrofoam cup of lemonade on Thursday. And the social issues are much more complex than the media and the political pundits will give credit for, including the one were dealing with today.The state has faced a backlash since the Republican-controlled General Assembly, during a one-day special session in March, passed a measure to limit public restroom access for transgender people and prohibit local governments from passing antidiscrimination ordinances. And Charlotte, a city of about 810,000 people that promoted itself in the 1970s as a good place to make money, has taken a particularly hard hit since the law known as House Bill 2 took effect.The Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority said the legislation, which Mr. McCrory called crucial to public safety and signed hours after its passage in the General Assembly, had jeopardized more than $86 million in event-related spending. PayPal dropped a plan to bring more than 400 jobs to the city, and Mayor Jennifer Roberts said she was spending substantial time reassuring companies about Charlotte.Weve never been characterized as so out of step with the mainstream of America, Ms. Roberts said.Mr. McCrory still has plenty of supporters here as he seeks a second term and faces Roy Cooper, the states attorney general, in a campaign that is already shaping up to be among the nations most bruising, in large part because of the law. But there are others who fondly remember his mayoralty and find themselves dismayed by his gradual emergence as a symbol of the legislatures conservative agenda.He had an appeal, said Lelia Johnson, 59, a Democrat. When he was here as mayor, he wanted to do good.She is far less impressed by the McCrory in the headlines now. It actually goes beyond being disappointed, she said. Im totally disillusioned.Mr. McCrorys allies say that the governors priorities have not shifted, but that he faces a more rigid and partisan political culture in Raleigh, the state capital.He has not changed as a person, said Edwin Peacock III, a Republican who ran for mayor last year. He has not changed as who you saw as mayor. His environment has changed. He is in an environment where collaboration is not rewarded.In 1990, not long after Mr. McCrory was first elected to the City Council, Charlottes population stood at about 395,000 people. As municipal leaders imagined Charlotte as a regional powerhouse, they focused intensely on matters like transportation, crime and economic development.The citys corporate leaders held outsize influence as Charlotte grew into what it is now: a place where Uptown glimmers and boosterism can border on pageantry. Residents across the city are still crowing about the Carolina Pantherss Super Bowl appearance and grousing about a rare public corruption scandal that surfaced in 2014. And as the city has grown  it hosted the Democratic National Convention in 2012  and drawn more outsiders, it has moved somewhat to the left. No Republican has been elected to a two-year term as mayor since Mr. McCrory.When Mr. McCrory was mayor, he generally faced a Democratic-controlled City Council, and he assembled a record that alternately delighted and frustrated officials across the political spectrum.And although Mr. McCrory is now enmeshed in what could become landmark litigation about transgender rights  he and the Justice Department sued each other last week over whether HB 2 violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964  social issues rarely animated him. Still, he repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to the conservatives who prized them. In 1992, for instance, Mr. McCrory opposed a proposal that would have broadened Charlottes anti-bias ordinance to include sexual orientation.We have laws in our constitution which forbid discrimination based on race, gender and religion, The Charlotte Observer quoted Mr. McCrory as saying in 1995. Beyond that, no other group should be given special status, and this community is often wanting special status, he said then, referring to gay people.He ran for governor in 2012 as a centrist and, bolstered by his record in Charlotte, won.Now, after repeatedly chiding Charlotte for approving an ordinance that he warned would provoke the legislature to act, he says that the citys politics have evolved more than his own.The city has gone more left than Ive gone right, he said. In fact, I havent gone right; the city has actually moved very left.His critics believe that he has either shifted sharply to the right or been forced to agree to the demands of Republican lawmakers from more conservative parts of North Carolina.I believe he went in with the intentions of being a moderate governor, but hes never had the ability to be that governor, said LaWana Mayfield, a Democrat who joined the City Council after Mr. McCrory left municipal politics. He is not a puppet master. Unfortunately, hes a puppet, and I hate that. I hate that for him; I hate that for his legacy.Within months, voters here will return a verdict that will clarify Mr. McCrorys standing and whether Charlottes residents support Governor McCrory the way they did Mayor McCrory. For now, it seems that the current clamor has left everyone a bit staggered and, as ever, worried about how Charlotte will be perceived elsewhere.When I travel, people say they hear Charlotte is a friendly and beautiful place, said Tim Hamilton, 55, a 31-year resident who runs a gift shop. I think were going to be getting, Oh, youre from Charlotte  what is going on there? for a long time. You can try to explain this is Raleigh, this is not Charlotte, but on the news it just says North Carolina, and people dont always look deeper.And so Mr. McCrorys town can sometimes appear to be frustrated, to the point that the mention of his name drew snickers at a community meeting last week.On the other hand, it is also clear that he has enhanced his standing among those voters who had long wondered whether he was sufficiently conservative, voters who could be crucial to his re-election hopes.About that H2B, B2, a middle-age woman told Mr. McCrory as he left a restaurant here and she struggled to remember the shorthand for House Bill 2. Thank you. Fight, fight, fight.Mr. McCrory smiled. A few moments before, a man had greeted him as Governor Pat."}
{"text": "New York, a city dominated by high rents and short attention spans, can be dangerous for small pizzerias that specialize in the humble slice. Vinnies, about 200 steps from the Bedford Avenue stop on the L train in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, thrives by selling colorful pizzas designed for customers who post pictures of their food on social media before they take a bite.For such a small pizzeria, Vinnies has an outsize online footprint. It is home to the photogenic Mini Vinnie, a slice covered in tiny pizza slices that caught the Internets attention last year. On the day that the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was a right, Vinnies created a rainbow slice. When Prince died, a Purple Rain slice with violet-hued cheese was on the menu.On a recent afternoon, a woman walked into the tiny dining room, smartphone at the ready. Her eyes landed on something intriguing: a pizza box fashioned out of pizza crust. The creation features a small pepperoni pie nestled between a base of Sicilian-crust pizza and a lid of garlicky, naan-like bread.I saw this on social media, she said.Another curious diner joined her, snapping photos. Nearby, one of the pizzerias owners, Sean Berthiaume, 35, beamed like a proud father. The pizza with an edible pizza box costs $40, and Vinnies has sold over 100 since posting the first photo of it on social media in late April.It sounds like the kind of creation dreamed up in a stoner haze, but Mr. Berthiaume said his goal was to reduce the number of pizza boxes piled up around the neighborhood. As for the inspiration, he added that he may be the only person in Williamsburg who doesnt smoke marijuana.My dad says Im getting residuals, he said.In 2007, Mr. Berthiaume and two friends, Jacob Petrera and Henrik Toncic, borrowed from relatives and pooled money to buy the pizzeria for $150,000 from a police officer who preferred to sit at the counter and smoke cigars. (As for the original Vinnie, whoever he was, hes been out of the picture for decades, Mr. Berthiaume said.) The pizzeria hasnt changed much from those days: The no-frills red booths, the black-and-white photographs and even the trash can are holdovers.The new owners quickly extended the pizzerias hours into the early morning and overhauled the menu. They focused on maintaining the existing clientele by selling New York classics, like meatball-ricotta, as well as attracting a new type of regular customer by introducing gluten-free options and dozens of nondairy, meat-free recipes. Vegan fare accounts for about a quarter of all sales, Mr. Berthiaume said. By their third year in business, the friends had paid their relatives back. In 2010, they opened another Vinnies nearby in Greenpoint.It doesnt look like a quote-unquote vegan spot, which I like, said Juliane Casey, 27, who works in events marketing. She completed her meal  a vegan version of a macaroni-and-cheese slice and a vegan barbecue chicken slice  by posting a photo on Instagram.The things I miss the most are pizza and mac and cheese, she said of eating a vegan diet. When I see it on the menu, it feels like they care about you.The Internets affection is welcome, but it doesnt pay the rent. So Vinnies owners focus on building relationships with their regulars, a mix of tourists and locals, often in the neighborhood uniform of black leather and Ray-Bans, who flood the tiny dining room during the evening rush.Brian Pramberger, 27, works in advertising and has been coming to Williamsburg since he was a teenager, back when many of the bars were lax about asking for ID.I would go out of my way to stop here, Mr. Pramberger said. It holds up."}
{"text": "Game of Thrones lived up to its billing as a song of ice and fire on Sunday, as there was plenty of action in both of the signature halves of the story.In the North we witnessed perhaps the rarest event in the Known World: An actual Stark reunion. The show has gone to gymnastic lengths to scuttle all previous brushes with the same  Arya and Sansa at the Eyrie; Bran and Jon at Crasters Keep; and most tragically, Arya and Robb and Catelyn at Chez Frey. For scarred Thrones fans, last weeks revelation that Jon Snow was moving on, as Sansa was making her way to Castle Black, promised to be the latest example of this.But there Sansa was on Sunday, showing up just in time to share a hug with her (theoretical) half brother and have a look at Ramsays charming Dear Jon letter. I may have yelped with joy when the gates opened to reveal Sansa and Brienne. This story has sprawled so prodigiously, there is a visceral thrill that comes from seeing disparate pieces connect, especially pieces of the tortured family that represents whatever good is left in the world.As for the fire portion of the program, well, you saw it. The Dothraki hut went up like a haystack soaked in kerosene, taking the potty-mouthed khals with it and allowing the unburnt dragon mother to emerge from the flames. As Dothraki-cowing parlor tricks go, its a good one, which we already know because we saw her do roughly the same thing with Khal Drogos funeral pyre in Season 1.Indeed, for many of us, Danys effortless bar-b-coup probably inspired the suspicion that the net result of the Slavers Bay excursions and Meereen misadventures were to get Daenerys Targaryen back to where she was over four seasons ago: leading a Dothraki force with designs on taking them on wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea.It was more complicated than that, of course, and well come back to Vaes Dothrak. But first lets return northwestward, where the show packed quite a bit into a few poignant scenes.It is a different Sansa whom Jon Snow met on Sunday  one full of righteous rage and a plan to retake their ancestral home by force. As for Jon, well hes still the same sullen dude who sulked in the corners of said home, give or take a zombie fight and a resurrection or two. (I did enjoy the self-referential joke about Jon as a moody youth in Winterfell.)But Sophie Turner and Kit Harington infused the scenes with warmth and a sense of familial comfort  the siblings delight at being together again was palpable, though tinged with melancholy for obvious reasons. We never should have left Winterfell, Snow said. We were reminded that most of what has happened over the past six seasons, not just the Stark strife but the various wars, betrayals and other machinations that have convulsed the world of this story, were triggered when Robert Baratheon called Ned to Kings Landing.Im sick of fighting, Jon told Sansa. Its all Ive been doing, and did I mention I got killed a few days ago? If you dont come along, Im doing it without you, she said. Then Ramsay the Terribles mocking letter arrived to put everyone on the same page.The missive signaled Ramsays overflowing arrogance (come and see) and why wouldnt it? Since we met him in Season 3, weve seen him break down and enslave a young nobleman; win his legitimacy at Moat Cailin, trick the formidable Petyr Littlefinger Baelish into letting him marry Sansa; defeat Stannis; and murder his own father to take control of House Bolton. His only misstep was allowing Sansa to escape but he quickly replaced her with her little brother.A few commenters thought the crafty and capable Osha might spell doom for him, and she apparently had the same idea. But nope. Soon she had a hole in her neck and the kennel masters hounds had a new special on the menu. (Fun fact: Natalia Tena and Iwan Rheon played a couple in a dystopian sci-fi mini-series last year called Residue. I havent seen it but its on Netflix.)The guy has good reasons to be arrogant, is the point. But the letters grandiosity felt like the moment Ramsay finally invited his own demise. Few things undo dramatic characters as effectively as preening hubris  just ask Joffrey, Oberyn, and any number of killed-off slavers and henchmen  and Ramsay doesnt realize how many forces are aligning against him. Over in the Vale, Littlefinger (welcome back!) has manipulated the Suckling Robin into sending troops to help Sansa. Plus Ramsays never met Wun Wun, who might not appreciate Lord Boltons vile threats against Wildlings. (I realize Im sort of obsessed with the improbable notion of Wun Wun the giant being the one to kill Ramsay but come on, what would be better?)Sansas steadfastness in the face of Jons reluctance offered the latest evidence that Sansa has assumed a leadership role within both her own family and her own story, in general. It was also one of several sibling dynamics that found the sisters taking command. Cersei Lannister bossing around Jaime is old news, of course, but on Sunday we also saw Margaery bucking up the disintegrating Loras and Theon volunteering for the committee to elect Yara leader of the Iron Born.Its become common this season to note that the female characters on Game of Thrones are stepping to the fore, but that was especially evident on Sunday. Women took purposeful steps to reshape their fortunes while, on the other side of the fence, our beloved Tyrion Lannsplained slavery to former slaves and the High Sparrow did his usual poverty-porn self-mythologizing for Margaery, who sees his empty brand-burnishing pieties for what they really are.And then we have the woman who literally burned the patriarchy to the ground.I admit that despite the visual flair of the sequence, I mostly sighed as Dany flambed the khal council. For one thing, there was the easy efficiency of the takeover. (Seriously, was that thing made of kindling or what? Or are we supposed to think Jorah and Daario somehow sprayed it down with lighter fluid in advance?) Then there was the fact that, as I said earlier, it essentially returned her to where she was a few seasons ago: leading a bunch of Dothrakis, with an eye on conquering Westeros.But the more I thought about it, the more the parallelism of her emergence highlighted how far she has come, even as much of her arc has been mired in the mostly cheerless stasis in Meereen. She has conquered cities. She has made mistakes. She has been underestimated and has learned the value of allowing herself to be underestimated. She has acquired the support of the Unsullied and of the oppressed of Slavers Bay, even if Tyrion threatens to undo much of that support. And not for nothing, but the baby dragons who emerged from that pyre are now, you know, actual giant fire-breathing dragons.Then there was the symbolism of the thing. The khals collectively represent a distilled, pure-grade dose of the savage aggression that has torn this world apart  they promised an almost cartoonish level of rape and cruelty and ended up as ash, showing in the process the ultimate fecklessness of bluster, dumb strength and braggadocio in the face of true transcendent power. The kind Dany represented in the early days of this story but is only now beginning to embody.Something tells me things are going to go better for her this time. The plot thickens in Kings Landing, where it now seems Cersei and Jaime plan to bring in a Tyrell army to overthrow the High Sparrow, perhaps as Margaery is queuing up for her own walk of shame. I have to admit Im a little confused by all of this  last week it seemed like we were headed toward a trial by combat. Maybe we still are. Or maybe Cerseis playing the Tyrells as part of a broader plot to regain power in the capital. The only thing Im sure of is: 1. Cersei is destined to underestimate how her actions might come back to bite her; and 2., somewhere Mountainstein is sharpening his sword and/or splattering a loose-lipped drunk against a wall. Many people wondered if the Rickons arrival at Winterfell was actually a House Umber plot to undo Ramsay, but Oshas thwarted gambit seemed to contradict that theory. Her actions seemed too impulsive and desperate. Or did you read that differently? After several seasons of flailing, Briennes really putting it all together. First she saved Sansa and now shes reunited her with a family member. She also cleared up any remaining mystery about whether Stannis somehow survived the Season 5 finale (he didnt) and served notice to the Red Woman over her role in Renlys smoky assassination. (Just because its in past doesnt mean I forget or forgive, she told her.) Now it seems romance might be in the frigid air of Castle Black. Tormund reacted to her arrival with the Wildling equivalent of a Looney Tunes wolf whistle. That Shireen shoe is going to drop at some point and its not going to be pretty. Davos and Melisandre have been uneasy allies this season but that revelation will bring an end to all that, to the point that Im not sure both will survive whatever comes afterward. Last week we put out an A.P.B. for Littlefinger  on Sunday we were rewarded by the master plotters first appearance this season. The thrill was undercut somewhat by the contemporaneous return of the squirrely Suckling Robin, who has made exactly zero positive strides since we last saw him. He still cant hit a target and he still lives to throw people out of the dreaded moon door. I enjoy him as a goof on the colorful history of actual half-wit nobles and monarchs  and thus as a walking critique of the very concept of royalty by birth. But he still gives me the creeps. Bronn, however, is still missing in action. Perhaps Cersei and Jaimes coup will have a place for him. What did you think? Are we finally done with Ramsay? But who becomes the big baddie if he goes down? Where does Dany go from here? What sound did you make when Brienne and Sansa arrived at Castle Black? Please share your thoughts in the comments."}

{"text": "Jennifer Rossmann, 41, has been a waitress at the Delta Diner in northwestern Wisconsin for 10 years.Q. Did you have a waitressing background when you joined the diner?A. No, but I did work at a doughnut shop for a year in Eugene, Ore. I was also a barista at a coffee shop in Duluth, Minn. I worked for a season at a salmon packing factory in Larsen Bay, Alaska. And I was an assistant manager at a Nature of Things, a chain retail store for nature lovers, also in Duluth.What has kept you working at the Delta Diner for 10 years?The owners, Nina and Todd Bucher, and the whole staff are like family to me. Our food is authentic diner food but with a creative flair. We dont hand out menus; each waitress recites whats being served that day to each table. We have a no-tipping policy; instead, we increased all menu items by 20 percent, allowing for a base adult wage of $15 an hour, many making more. Finally, its in the middle of nowhere, in the heart of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, so you know people who come really want to be here. That happy mood is contagious.Whats challenging about the job?There are seven or eight of us working the busiest shifts at once in a 720-square-foot space, a restored 1940s diner, which includes seven booths, 16 counter stools and the hot grill area. So we have to move carefully and in sync with each other. Todd likes to compare it to a well-choreographed, well-rehearsed dance routine.What would you be doing if you werent a waitress?Actually, I work three-quarter time. I have been sculpting for 20 years; I work with all sorts of media, making figurines and caricatures, anything from little birds to wedding cake toppers. I call that business Js Clay. I also draw cartoons. I am also a volunteer coach in discus and shot put at Northwestern High School in Maple, Wis.How do you measure your success?Success is how you define it. Though I would love to make $300,000 a year, if it messed with my quality of life and happiness, I would easily walk away. At work, its being part of something bigger than me; I feed off that energy. At home, its raising three great kids with my husband, Tom, and owning a home we built on 85 acres near the Brule River State Forest. Plus, we get to take advantage of all the outdoor recreation in this part of the country. These things are priceless to me."}
{"text": "Runners and bicyclists zoomed across the landscaped corridor on Saturday, taking advantage of the breezy, sunny conditions to enjoy what many had long sought  a link connecting the South Bronx to Randalls Island.They were trailed by power walkers and others who slowed to take in the scene and snap photographs of the flowering vines, shrubs and ornamental grasses that, along with the chirping birds, created an idyllic scene and masked the bustle of the busy streets nearby.Its like Central Park in the Bronx, Karen Olivares, 23, said while she strolled with her boyfriend. This is like a secret getaway.After years of delays, the Randalls Island Connector, which crosses over a narrow waterway known as the Bronx Kill, is finally a reality for Bronx residents who have long felt cut off from Randalls Island, one of the citys main recreation hubs. Though the connector opened to pedestrians and cyclists last year, local residents decided, with spring underway, to treat Saturday as an unofficial grand opening.This has been years in the making, and seeing people walking and biking over the Bronx Kill to Randalls Island makes it all worth it, said Maria Torres-Springer, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which oversaw the project. This gives Bronx residents access to all the amenities that Randalls Island has to offer, improving quality of life in the neighborhood and exemplifying our commitment to building strong and equitable communities across all five boroughs.Before the connector was finished, the only direct route to Randalls Island by foot was a difficult crossing on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (formerly the Triborough Bridge) that required navigating steep steps or winding ramps alongside heavy traffic.The new link, by contrast, is a wide, ground-level pathway that starts just down the street from the bridge and runs a quarter-mile under the arches of an Amtrak trestle and over a red pedestrian bridge. It is accessible to those with disabilities, has dedicated bike and pedestrian lanes and is flanked with lights and shrubs.The eagerly awaited connector was originally scheduled to open last summer, but remained blocked off by a black metal gate and construction barriers. It was not completed until mid-November, long past the peak season for outdoor activities. Ian Fried, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation, said that extensive testing of the connector to ensure its safety had caused the delay.The city proposed the $6-million project, which was paid for with local, state and federal money, in 2006 as part of a larger plan to create a South Bronx Greenway in an industrial swath of the borough. Work began in late 2013, following protracted negotiations over the easements needed to build the pathway, which runs through property that is owned by the state, but privately controlled.While separated from the Bronx by just a few feet of water, Randalls Island had for decades seemed distant to the people of the South Bronx, Ms. Torres-Springer said.The lack of easy access to Randalls Island  a 330-acre expanse of public parkland that includes wildflower meadows, a track-and-field stadium, baseball and soccer fields, and tennis courts  has long been a contentious issue in the Bronx. Residents of some parts of the borough, where rates of asthma, diabetes and obesity-related illnesses are high, lack sizable parks. The problem is particularly acute in the South Bronx.Many residents have begun to make the connector part of their routines in recent months, taking advantage of an unusually mild winter. Bicycle commuters pass use it to pass through the island daily on their way to jobs in Manhattan or Queens.Randalls Island now draws more than 3 million visitors a year, up from 1.7 million in 2012, according to the Randalls Island Park Alliance, a nonprofit group that maintains the parkland in partnership with the citys parks department. The island, which was joined with Wards Island by landfill, was once known primarily as a setting for asylums and hospitals before being developed for recreation beginning in the 1930s.Aimee Boden, the alliances president, said that her group had noted steady use of the connector, and recently installed a clicker with a motion-activated sensor to count the number of people passing through.The alliance had increased the number of free events held on the island to 100 this year, up from 15 in 2014, partly in anticipation of increased foot traffic from the new connector, Ms Boden said.Among those events: a cherry blossom festival held on the island on Saturday. The alliance will also be offering programs that teach fishing and orienteering; bird-watching excursions and historical walking tours are planned as well.On the Bronx side of the connector on Saturday, a celebration was organized by Jeanine Alfieri, an artist who lives nearby and considers the link a linchpin to efforts to transform a stretch of industrial waterfront in Port Morris, a South Bronx neighborhood that has attracted artists and new businesses in recent years.Ms. Alfieri and other artists opened their studios for the day as part of the celebration, which also included a jazz concert and the staging of an original piece by Autumn Kioti, a performance artist. This is really the communitys celebration, Ms. Alfieri said. We didnt get a chance in November when it officially opened.Ms. Alfieri said she had not gone to Randalls Island in the past because she disliked the crossing. But recently, she said, she had been crossing the connector several times a week with her dog.Its beyond easy, she said. Its just like walking out your front door and having Randalls Island in front of you.Ms. Olivares, who lives in the Bronx, went to the connector with her boyfriend, Francisco Torres Jr., on Saturday morning after learning about the festivities from a flier posted at a nearby subway station. The couple said they had recently started running outdoors and were planning to take advantage of the new pathway on weekends.Mr. Torres, a 37-year-old city bus driver, said he remembered when the ground he was walking on was piled high with trash, used tires and abandoned cars. Now, he said, its like heaven."}

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.While in a coffee shop, I was hit on by a man who was about 20 years older than me. He gave me a compliment and handed me a note with his name and email address. I wasnt excited about it, but I didnt feel creeped out or threatened.As one does, I searched for him on Google. It turns out hes an accomplished figure in the industry in which I work, and in which I am trying to cement myself more firmly. Hes been doing his job for a long time, and I would guess he has a lot of wisdom to impart, not to mention connections.Im definitely not interested in him romantically or sexually (Im in love with someone else). I am, however, interested in a professional connection.But is that a bad idea because its not why he approached me? Or because hes expressed a presumably romantic or sexual interest and it will therefore be forever uncomfortable to have any other kind of relationship? Or even because the kind of guy who would do that in the first place is someone you want to stay away from? Our field is small, so I dont want to burn any bridges.ANONYMOUSMy suspicion is that converting this into a useful career contact is a long shot. I suppose neither one of us really knows what this man is like, so its possible that Im being unfair. But I think you should proceed with caution.Youve already covered most of the arguments for not following up. The only one Id add is that he might conclude that an anecdote about him hitting on a significantly younger woman in a coffee shop is now circulating through his tightknit work community.But the best argument for any sort of follow-up may be that youll end up running into him professionally at some point anyway, and that could be awkward for you both. Even with that as a rationale, Id make any communication clear and concise. Be direct about being in a relationship  or however you want to put it  in a manner that removes all ambiguity about the romantic angle. Then matter-of-factly note that you later realized youre in the same line of work. (Take care in explaining that: Googling him might be interpreted as evidence that youre more interested than you claim. Is it plausible that his name rang a bell and thats why you searched it?)Finally, rather than pivoting to a networking or mentoring request, maybe say something more neutral: Small world  maybe your paths will cross professionally at some point.He should get the message that youre not looking for a date but that you respect his role in your mutual line of work (and youre not out there gossiping about him). Leave it up to him to decide whether to offer some sort of shoptalk opportunity.This may not lead anywhere. But it should at least clear the air, and keep expectations modest  on both sides. Maybe hell turn out to be a thoughtful and generous guy who has no problem separating the personal and the professional when hes not busy handing out his email to attractive strangers. But youre probably better off if youre not counting on that outcome.A while ago, I had a job interview scheduled via Skype. Ten minutes before it was supposed to happen, the interviewer canceled. We arranged another appointment. This time my interviewer simply never showed up. I emailed him afterward, but he did not respond.I contacted his immediate superior (with whom Id had brief email contact previously), politely suggesting an alternative interview situation. This person told me to try to set up a new time with the same interviewer. I threw up my hands. Its difficult to envision things going well after youve brought an interviewers shortcomings up to his boss.How would one handle this with delicate but determined self-advocacy?ANNE, AUSTIN, TEX.One the most surprising things about the Workologist inbox is the number of anecdotes involving disappearing employers: recruiters who vanish, interviewers who fail to materialize at the scheduled time, etc.The most practical response is to get over it and move on. Thats probably not very satisfying, but consider the most likely explanations for such behavior. One is that the position will be filled internally, but theres some kind of pro forma process that involves talking to theoretical outside candidates. The other is that this company simply does not have its organizational act together.Youve already tried the best and most difficult response: finding a workaround that indicates your continued interest and that some deeper problem is gumming up the works. Maybe pushing back with that superior could yield something productive. If you accept that you have nothing to lose here, you could state diplomatically yet firmly that youre open to an interviewer contacting you if there is serious interest  but your time is too valuable to keep chasing someone who doesnt show up for appointments. You may never hear back, but at least you sent the right message.Employers, stories like this show that if your basic hiring procedures are sloppy, it affects your reputation  maybe more than you realize. Keep appointments, and follow up even with rejected candidates. Its not that hard."}
{"text": "Jaspal Ricky Singh and Channi Parihar met as undergraduates at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.Ms. Parihar moved to New York, working as a special education teacher, and lived with her sister in a one-bedroom condominium, converted to a two-bedroom, in a postwar high-rise in Murray Hill, on the East Side.Dr. Singh moved among several cities for his medical training. He and Ms. Parihar married four years ago, and they lived with her sister as he started work at Weill Cornell Medicine on the Upper East Side, where he is a physician specializing in spine medicine.After a cramped month, Dr. and Mrs. Singh moved nearby to a renovated one-bedroom at View 34, formerly the Rivergate, the huge 1985 rental building near the East River.Within weeks, Hurricane Sandy struck. Their lobby was flooded. For most of the ensuing three weeks, they again stayed with Mrs. Singhs sister.Over time, their rent climbed to $3,400 a month from around $2,900. With plans to have a baby, the Singhs, who are now in their 30s, decided to buy a larger place. So they contacted Bobby Rehani, a salesman at City Connections Realty, whom they knew through friends.They wanted to remain in Murray Hill, near family and friends. They had plenty of amenity-filled condominium towers to choose among, many dating from the 1980s.With a top price of around $1.2 million, the Singhs aimed for two bedrooms and two bathrooms. They thought about finding a place with enough space to create a third bedroom for their many guests.They would have been happy with one-and-a-half-bathrooms, but those proved rare. The price would jump up a lot when it was two full baths, Mrs. Singh said.They saw several units that they crossed off their list because they seemed outdated.At the Horizon on East 37th Street, opened in 1989, a 1,100-square-foot two-bedroom, listed at $1.15 million with monthly charges of around $2,000, had a triangular living room. The shape didnt work for their plan to create a guest bedroom.And the building was adjacent to a development site, near the former Con Ed pier, so they could face years of construction, Mr. Rehani said. The place sold for $1.11 million.At that point, a year and a half ago, Mr. Rehani told the Singhs about the Corinthian Collection, in the Corinthian, opened in 1989 on East 38th Street. Within the 817-unit building, the sponsor had retained 144 units that were to be renovated but were not yet on the market.Mr. Rehani mentioned the buildings golf simulator.Dr. Singh lit up. He missed being able to use his golf clubs, and rarely made it to one of Manhattans few driving ranges.No model apartment was ready, but they had three pictures, Dr. Singh said. They looked great.The Singhs liked a two-bedroom with two bathrooms, covering nearly 1,200 square feet. Renovated  as in the three pictures  it would be more than $1.5 million, Mr. Rehani said.I wish he hadnt shown us the drawings, because it was out of our price range, Mrs. Singh said.It looked as if they would be able to split the living room into two rooms. The Singhs offered $1.558 million for a renovated unit by email, almost on a whim. And then we forgot about it, Dr. Singh said.At the Charleston on East 34th Street, built about 2007, Dr. Singh liked the symmetrical layout of a two-bedroom. But the price was $1.85 million, with monthly charges of $2,260, so the couple kept looking. That was more about showing them whats available at different price points, Mr. Rehani said.Soon, Mr. Rehani contacted the Singhs to say the Corinthian Collection was officially open for sales. The sponsor agreed to accept the couples email offer of $1.558 million; monthly charges would be slightly more than $2,000.After doing the math and talking with friends and family, the Singhs decided to go ahead. The fact that they honored that simple email is amazing, Dr. Singh said.Two-bedrooms at the Corinthian Collection are now listed for approximately $1.6 million to $2.3 million.The occupancy date was repeatedly pushed back. At first, the delay was welcome. The couple had a few months remaining on their lease. But when the new place still wasnt ready, they ended up renting by the month, for which the rent rose to $4,500.They arrived in the winter, deciding to keep the living room intact and instead add a trundle bed to the second bedroom, which they will use as a nursery. The bathroom space is everything they wanted, particularly the master bathroom, which has a double vanity with two sinks.They have found home ownership frustrating at times. Last month, Mrs. Singh, now pregnant with a daughter due in August, arose in the night and found water gushing from beneath the kitchen sink. The couple called 911 and ran downstairs.The flood, as it turned out, was coming from the floor above. Apparently a water filtration system beneath a sink had broken.The cleanup required fans and dehumidifiers. Some outlets were temporarily knocked out of commission.Such water issues are nothing unusual and just the typical day-to-day maintenance of a larger building, said Cari Nogas, a spokeswoman for the building.Dr. Singh uses the golf simulator as often as possible. Recently, descending in the elevator with his golf clubs, he was informed by neighbors that it was raining outside. I said, I am going to the golf simulator in our building,  Dr. Singh said. They said, We have a golf simulator? They didnt even know."}
{"text": "BARCELONA, Venezuela  By morning, three newborns were already dead.The day had begun with the usual hazards: chronic shortages of antibiotics, intravenous solutions, even food. Then a blackout swept over the city, shutting down the respirators in the maternity ward.Doctors kept ailing infants alive by pumping air into their lungs by hand for hours. By nightfall, four more newborns had died.The death of a baby is our daily bread, said Dr. Osleidy Camejo, a surgeon in the nations capital, Caracas, referring to the toll from Venezuelas collapsing hospitals.The economic crisis in this country has exploded into a public health emergency, claiming the lives of untold numbers of Venezuelans. It is just part of a larger unraveling here that has become so severe it has prompted President Nicols Maduro to impose a state of emergency and has raised fears of a government collapse.Hospital wards have become crucibles where the forces tearing Venezuela apart have converged. Gloves and soap have vanished from some hospitals. Often, cancer medicines are found only on the black market. There is so little electricity that the government works only two days a week to save what energy is left.At the University of the Andes Hospital in the mountain city of Mrida, there was not enough water to wash blood from the operating table. Doctors preparing for surgery cleaned their hands with bottles of seltzer water.It is like something from the 19th century, said Dr. Christian Pino, a surgeon at the hospital.The figures are devastating. The rate of death among babies under a month old increased more than a hundredfold in public hospitals run by the Health Ministry, to just over 2 percent in 2015 from 0.02 percent in 2012, according to a government report provided by lawmakers.The rate of death among new mothers in those hospitals increased by almost five times in the same period, according to the report.Here in the Caribbean port town of Barcelona, two premature infants died recently on the way to the main public clinic because the ambulance had no oxygen tanks. The hospital has no fully functioning X-ray or kidney dialysis machines because they broke long ago. And because there are no open beds, some patients lie on the floor in pools of their blood.It is a battlefield clinic in a country where there is no war.Some come here healthy, and they leave dead, Dr. Leandro Prez said, standing in the emergency room of Luis Razetti Hospital, which serves the town.This nation has the largest oil reserves in the world, yet the government saved little money for hard times when oil prices were high. Now that prices have collapsed  they are around a third what they were in 2014  the consequences are casting a destructive shadow across the country. Lines for food, long a feature of life in Venezuela, now erupt into looting. The bolvar, the countrys currency, is nearly worthless.The crisis is aggravated by a political feud between Venezuelas leftists, who control the presidency, and their rivals in congress. The presidents opponents declared a humanitarian crisis in January, and this month passed a law that would allow Venezuela to accept international aid to prop up the health care system.This is criminal that we can sit in a country with this much oil, and people are dying for lack of antibiotics, says Oneida Guaipe, a lawmaker and former hospital union leader.But Mr. Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chvez, went on television and rejected the effort, describing the move as a bid to undermine him and privatize the hospital system.I doubt that anywhere in the world, except in Cuba, there exists a better health system than this one, Mr. Maduro said.Late last fall, the aging pumps that supplied water to the University of the Andes Hospital exploded. They were not repaired for months.So without water, gloves, soap or antibiotics, a group of surgeons prepared to remove an appendix that was about to burst, even though the operating room was still covered in another patients blood.Even in the capital, only two of nine operating rooms are functioning at the J. M. de los Ros Childrens Hospital.There are people dying for lack of medicine, children dying of malnutrition and others dying because there are no medical personnel, said Dr. Yamila Battaglini, a surgeon at the hospital.Yet even among Venezuelas failing hospitals, Luis Razetti Hospital in Barcelona has become one of the most notorious.In April, the authorities arrested its director, Aquiles Martnez, and removed him from his post. Local news reports said he was accused of stealing equipment meant for the hospital, including machines to treat people with respiratory illnesses, as well as intravenous solutions and 127 boxes of medicine.Around 10 one recent night, Dr. Freddy Daz walked down a hall there that had become an impromptu ward for patients who had no beds. Some clutched blood-soaked bandages and called from the floor for help. One, brought in by the police, was handcuffed to a gurney. In a supply room, cockroaches fled as the door swung open.Dr. Daz logged a patients medical data on the back of a bank statement someone had thrown in the trash.We have run out of paper here, he said.On the fourth floor, one of his patients, Rosa Parucho, 68, was one of the few who had managed to get a bed, though the rotting mattress had left her back covered in sores.But those were the least of her problems: Ms. Parucho, a diabetic, was unable to receive kidney dialysis because the machines were broken. An infection had spread to her feet, which were black that night. She was going into septic shock.Ms. Parucho needed oxygen, but none was available. Her hands twitched and her eyes rolled into the back of her head.The bacteria arent dying; theyre growing, Dr. Daz said, noting that three of the antibiotics Ms. Parucho needed had been unavailable for months.He paused. We will have to remove her feet.Three relatives sat reading the Old Testament before an unconscious woman. She had arrived six days before, but because a scanning machine had broken, it was days before anyone discovered the tumor occupying a quarter of her frontal lobe.Samuel Castillo, 21, arrived in the emergency room needing blood. But supplies had run out. A holiday had been declared by the government to save electricity, and the blood bank took donations only on workdays. Mr. Castillo died that night.For the past two and a half months, the hospital has not had a way to print X-rays. So patients must use a smartphone to take a picture of their scans and take them to the proper doctor.It looks like tuberculosis, said an emergency room doctor looking at the scan of a lung on a cellphone. But I cant tell. The quality is bad.Finding medicine is perhaps the hardest challenge.The pharmacy here has bare shelves because of a shortage of imports, which the government can no longer afford. When patients need treatment, the doctors hand relatives a list of medicines, solutions and other items needed to stabilize the patients or to perform surgery. Loved ones are then sent back the way they came to find black-market sellers who have the goods.The same applies to just about everything else one might need here.You must bring her diapers now, a nurse told Alejandro Ruiz, whose mother had been taken to the emergency room.What else? he asked, clutching large trash bags he had brought filled with blankets, sheets, pillows and toilet paper.Nicols Espinosa sat next to his tiny daughter, who has spent two of her five years with cancer. He was running out of money to pay for her intravenous solutions. Inflation had increased the price by 16 times what he paid a year ago.He flipped through a list of medicines he was trying to find here in Barcelona and in a neighboring city. Some of the drugs are meant to protect the body during chemotherapy, yet the girls treatments ended when the oncology department ran out of the necessary drugs a month and a half ago.Near him, a handwritten sign read, We sell antibiotics  negotiable. A black-market sellers number was listed.Bicea Prez, 36, scanned the halls looking for anyone who would listen to her.Can someone help my father? she asked.Her father, Jos Calvo, 61, had contracted Chagas disease, a sickness caused by a parasite. But the medication Mr. Calvo had been prescribed ran out in his part of Venezuela that year, and he began to suffer heart failure.Six hours after Ms. Prezs plea, a scream was heard in the emergency room. It was Mr. Calvos sister: My darling, my darling, she moaned. Mr. Calvo was dead.His daughter paced the hall alone, not knowing what to do. Her hands covered her face, and then clenched into fists.Why did the director of this hospital steal that equipment? was all she could say. Tell me whose fault is this?The ninth floor of the hospital is the maternity ward, where the seven babies had died the day before. A room at the end of the hall was filled with broken incubators.The glass on one was smashed. Red, yellow and blue wires dangled from another.Dont use  nonfunctional, said a sign dated last November.Dr. Amalia Rodrguez stood in the hallway.I had a patient just now who needed artificial respiration, and I had none available, Dr. Rodrguez said. A baby. What can we do?The day of the power blackout, Dr. Rodrguez said, the hospital staff tried turning on the generator, but it did not work.Doctors tried everything they could to keep the babies breathing, pumping air by hand until the employees were so exhausted they could barely see straight, she said. How many babies died because of the blackout was impossible to say, given all of the other deficiencies at the hospital.What can we do here? Dr. Rodrguez said. Every day I pass an incubator that doesnt heat up, that is cold, that is broken."}

{"text": "By pairing two plays about painting, the Westport Country Playhouse asks its audiences to think about the art form. The productions mention, among many styles, Abstract Expressionism, Cubism, Conceptual, Modern and Pop Art. They show painters and their audiences. They discuss the display space and the marketplace. They feature critiques galore.But the richest vein running through this repertory offering of the two plays  Yasmina Rezas Art, a comedy of manners, and John Logans Red, a psychological drama  is what they say, in tandem, about men. Between them, the plays feature five (two in Red, three in Art) and if an alien were watching, it would be doing its job by describing the male sex as ego-beholden. Even Yvan of Art, with his overly accommodating nature, is aware that he is an outlier of this typical male drive.The men in Red, which is being presented on odd-number days, are the painter Mark Rothko (or an imagined version of him) and Ken, his (fictional) young assistant. When Ken (Patrick Andrews) begins working for Rothko, he cedes power to the master painter, as he should, because Rothko (Stephen Rowe) flings his power all over his studio, bellowing his needs, hurling objects when he is interrupted and lecturing in tidal waves about his motivations, his process, his beliefs and his significance. Ken is a mostly receptive partner to an explosive pontificator.But Ken is a painter as well, and a man, and it is only a matter of time before he asserts himself in a way that escalates from questions to disagreements to a fiery lecture of his own.Mr. Andrews is magnetic in his silences, his earnest looks balanced by busy, often guarded eyes. When he erupts in a volcanic monologue late in the play  the son dissecting the fathers Apollonian and Dionysian guises  it is as if he were a mental gymnast swinging furiously through aesthetic monkey bars.There is something even more simian about Mr. Rowes Rothko. Broad-shouldered and barrel-chested, he lumbers around the set (of grand scale and authentic detail, designed by Allen Moyer) with the authority of a Great Man. When he eats Chinese noodles, he stuffs them in his mouth, letting them trail over his lips as he talks; he is entitled to feed as he likes, just as he is entitled to let the slight belly he has earned hang proudly over his waist. When he holds forth on how his generation murdered the cubists, he is just describing the natural course of progenitors and their offspring. When he seethes at how Pop Art might murder him and his cohorts, he is a sneering defender of his own status quo.Yet behind all that is a man who is realistic about the ways of the world, who knows that a prison of black is creeping into his vital red, both in his works and in his soul. Mr. Rowe, who here bears a striking, if earthier, resemblance to Rothko, inhabits the role thoroughly and viscerally, at once the scrappy Jewish Bowery bully, the spittle-spewing defender of good art, the dogged, Socratic teacher and the sophisticated and hungry consumer of ideas. He is fantastic, and he and Mr. Andrews share a mesmerizing connection.Mark Lamos, who directed both plays, has found and finely supported the shape of the outstanding Red, with natural rhythms and assured moments of quiet contemplation that are visual artwork themselves. His touch is more evident, and busy, in Art.The three men in the comic play are obsessed with painting as well  one painting, at least, a canvas of white and nothing else, loved and bought by the Parisian Serge (John Skelley). One of his friends, Marc (Benton Greene), cannot stand that Serge would admire work that to his eye seems ridiculous. More of a classicist, Marc fears that he has lost his grasp on his onetime devotee (in male terms, someone must have the power, right?), and he attacks Serge to set the world to his thinking.A precise man in body and mind, Mr. Skelleys Serge is willing and able to return fire at such provocations. Both he and Marc try to recruit their mild-mannered friend Yvan (Sean Dugan) to their cause, though his nature makes him a buffer, and occasional victim, in the battle. Mr. Dugan is a physically and emotionally supple Yvan, earning laughs with exquisite timing and surprising, idiosyncratic deliveries. Mr. Greene, conversely, strikes his notes in staccato pulses, and the impact is less resonant.Mr. Lamos has validly made a stylized living-room farce of Ms. Rezas play; in one scene, actors cross legs at the same time in a pronounced fashion, to a big audience response. The danger in this zippy approach is that it can valorize laughter to the point that there is little sense of the mens lived-in friendship. That happens too much among this young cast, perhaps too young for the over-40 parts.While the production lacks some finesse, the actors counter with commitment to the quick-hitting comedy. It is truly funny and makes a fine marriage with the more profound Red, both plays exposing men who will fight for dominance of their ideological turf. Appropriately for two productions about visual art, the lighting by Matthew Richards can be bright in its pep, shadowy for dark nights of the soul and, almost necessarily, sublime in its beauty.In this pairing, my tastes run more toward Red, which hits deeply in so many ways  intellectual, emotional, visceral  and, in the Rothko characters demeaning quips and melodramatic tales, has its share of laughs, too. But there is no denying the stylish appeal of this production of Art. That alien playgoer would leave with his thoughts about men, sure, but also with ideas about painting and assurance that Earth can produce some mighty fine theater."}
{"text": "Greg Sargent interviews Hillarys chief strategist about the coming general election, and finds him dismissive of claims that Donald Trump can repeat his march through the Republican primary. You never know  but it does seem obvious, except to the political pundits completely flabbergasted by Trumps rise, that the general election is going to be a very different story. For the truth is that Trumps Republican rivals fought with both hands tied behind their backs, and that just wont happen from here on in.Greg summarizes the case very well, but let me do it a bit differently. Think about Trumps obvious weaknesses, why Republicans couldnt exploit them, but why Democrats can.First, hes running a campaign fundamentally based on racism. But Republicans couldnt call him on that, because more or less veiled appeals to racial resentment have been key to their partys success for decades. Clinton, on the other hand, won the nomination thanks to overwhelming nonwhite support, and will have no trouble hitting hard on this issue.Second, Trump is proposing wildly irresponsible policies that benefit the rich. But so were all the other Republicans, so they couldnt attack him for that. Clinton can.Third, Trumps personal record as a businessman is both antisocial and just plain dubious. Republicans, with their cult of the entrepreneur, couldnt say anything about that. Again, Clinton can.The G.O.P. paralysis on these issues explains why, again and again, Republicans turned to a proven line of attack  that is, proven not to work: insisting that Trump isnt a true conservative, which matters to voters not at all. Obviously Democrats will be able to go after different and, I imagine, a lot more salient issues.And theres one last thing, which I suspect may make the biggest difference of all: Clintons campaign can go after Trumps fundamental buffoonery.I mean, he is a ludicrous figure, and everything we learn just makes him more ludicrous. So why couldnt Republicans make that stick? Id argue that it was because there was something fairly ludicrous about all his opponents, too.Think about Marco Rubio: even before his famous brain glitch, it was just obvious that he was a prefab candidate, a nice-looking guy with no real convictions or experience reciting lines he was told to deliver. The infamous We must dispel with  wasnt just vile and stupid (even the first time, let alone repeated); it was also, transparently, not something Rubio believed or even cared about except that his handlers told him to say it.Or think about Ted Cruz, whose mean-spiritedness and self-centered nature evidently stand out even in todays conservative movement, making him a hated figure even among those who should like his message.Clinton, on the other hand, is not ludicrous. She can think on her feet; shes tough as nails. Do you really think the person who stared down the Benghazi committee for 11 hours is going to wither under schoolboy taunts?The news media will, I fear, try their best to pretend that the contrast isnt what it is. Well hear endless explanations of why Trumps vanity, ignorance, and lack of moral fiber somehow prove his authenticity, which Clinton somehow lacks. And maybe that will stick with voters. But I dont think it will. In the end, it will be a race between a tough, smart lady and someone who is obviously a yuge, um, Antonin Scalia School of Law. And voters will notice."}
{"text": "ATLANTIC CITY  As a cocktail waitress for 27 years in this citys Xanadu of a casino industry, Valerie McMorris learned the hard way that Donald Trumps art of the deal too often proved to be the art of bankruptcy. Ive been through three bankruptcies with Mr. Trump, she said, recalling how the fast years of gambling growth here degenerated into a crushing excess of casinos. She watched as Mr. Trump hurried to remove TRUMP from the facades of suddenly failing casinos, lest they undermine his claims to financial invincibility.The self-branding mania that has helped Mr. Trump earn his victory as the presumed Republican candidate for president has not worked here. Ms. McMorris, a union representative for Unite Here Local 54 of the citys casino workers, is fascinated by how his political winning streak plays out just beyond a battered Atlantic City, a destination once identified with Mr. Trump that serves now as a reality check. His name has disappeared from three casinos, one of which has closed. Across the city, casino workers have lost pensions and health care in bankruptcy proceedings, and four of 12 casinos closed in recent years, with thousands of jobs lost. Home foreclosures are multiplying and the city has suffered such a precipitous loss in revenue that the state is threatening a takeover.Carl Icahn as Trumps secretary of the Treasury? Ms. McMorris asks with alarm of Mr. Trumps billionaire ally, who has been mentioned as a possible cabinet choice in a Trump administration. Mr. Icahn owns the Trump Taj Mahal, the one place where Mr. Trumps name remains prominent, and has been keeping the casino afloat since it filed for bankruptcy in 2014, in part by eliminating union benefits.There is a memorable line in the movie Atlantic City when Lou Pascal, the aging hoodlum go-fer played by Burt Lancaster, celebrates the beachfront citys simpler past of tourists and gangsters: You should have seen the Atlantic Ocean in those days. But there seemed a glimmer of Lous wistfulness on Monday when Senator Bernie Sanders came to town to campaign before New Jerseys June 7 primary. With Local 54s endorsement in his pocket, Mr. Sanders delighted a crowd with a thumping attack on Mr. Trump and Mr. Icahn as enablers of the ugliness and the greed that were seeing all over this country.I like Bernies vernacular, said Ms. McMorris, who was on the union welcoming committee. Carl Icahn did not like it, later issuing a sharp riposte claiming to have saved thousands of jobs by taking the Taj from bankruptcy, rough as the price was on workers. He accused the union of having squeezed the citys most important employers into an exorbitant and ultimately ruinous health plan.Except for Mr. Trumps checkered business history here, he might have enjoyed strong campaign support from the citys deeply frustrated casino workers. (He might yet garner some, workers admit privately, depending on the Democratic nominee.) Right now Local 54 is feeling the Bern."}

{"text": "ROME  Nine months removed from her last title, Serena Williams won the Italian Open on Sunday and then played down the significance of ending the drought, one of the longest of her career.Williams, who had played in only four tournaments over that stretch, said her 7-6 (5), 6-3 victory over Madison Keys in Sundays final was satisfying but not necessarily a relief.Its only four tournaments, so its not like I was playing every week, said Williams, 34, whose last WTA Tour title had come at the Cincinnati Masters in August. So thats kind of how I look at it. But it feels great to win a title, especially on clay.Williams, who won the tournament for the fourth time and earned her 70th career singles title, had lost her two previous finals this year, at the Australian Open and in Indian Wells, Calif. She had not lost consecutive finals since 2004.Williams had another slow start in Sundays final, the first clay-court final between American women since Williams beat her sister Venus at the 2002 French Open and the first between two American women in Rome since 1970.Keys, 21, broke Williams at love in the opening game and extended her lead to 3-1. But Keys cooled as the temperature dropped and the wind kicked up, with the weather forcing spectators to reach for their jackets and hats. Keys double-faulted twice, and Williams broke back in the sixth game.Little separated the two from there, with Keys sometimes able to overpower Williams, especially on her forehand wing. But after Keys hit one of her best forehands to pull even in the tiebreaker at 5-5, Williams eked out the next two points, and she quickly pulled ahead in the second set.As the two met at the net after the match, Williams told Keys that she would one day be No. 1.Yeah, too bad what she says doesnt just happen, Keys said, smiling. But yeah, I mean, its always great to hear that from her. Shes obviously an amazing champion, and shes won so many matches and tournaments. Hearing that is definitely something that makes me just want to work harder.Williamss own hard work was crucial in her victory, said her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.For me, she wasnt there mentally  zero, Mouratoglou said, referring to Williamss play in March at the Indian Wells and Miami tournaments. It happens. A career is long, especially hers, and you go through different stages, and you have to find solutions to different problems in certain stages. So that was one of those moments.But the reaction here was really good. This win happened because of her focus, her motivation, everything.Mouratoglou said he expected Williamss strong form to carry into the French Open, where she will have another chance to tie Steffi Grafs Open-era record of 22 major titles. Williams was defeated in her two previous chances to match the mark, at the United States Open last year and the Australian Open in January.The last steps are always the most difficult, Mouratoglou said. But its not so difficult that shes not going to make it.He added, Shell get through it, whether at this one or the next one or the next one.In the mens final on Sunday, Andy Murray defeated a clearly tired Novak Djokovic, 6-3, 6-3.Djokovic had battled late into the night on Saturday to beat Kei Nishikori in a third-set tiebreaker. He had also needed more than two hours to oust fifth-seeded Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals.On Sunday, with his energy flagging, Djokovic grew increasingly frustrated with the chair umpire, Damian Steiner, over court conditions he considered dangerously damp.Murray, who won his first Italian Open title and his 12th Masters title over all, had lost 12 of his previous 13 matches against Djokovic, including the final last week in Madrid.I knew that physically I was fresh, but I also hadnt been pushed that hard, whereas he had been, Murray said. Thats why I was really happy with the second set in particular, because he did have chances and I was behind in some of my service games and I responded well."}
{"text": "PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.  The back-nine drama that turned Rickie Fowler into a bona fide leading man at last years Players Championship was gone, replaced in this years event by Jason Days solidification as golfs leading closer. The top-ranked Day posted a one-under-par 71 on Sunday at the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass for a 72-hole score of 15-under 273, four strokes ahead of Kevin Chappell, who carded a final-round 69.With the victory, Day recorded his  and the PGA Tours  second wire-to-wire win of the 2015-16 season, matching his emphatic performance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March. At the postround ceremony, Fowler, who had erased a five-stroke deficit last year with a final-round 67 and then prevailed in a playoff, handed Day the crystal trophy and congratulated him on some spectacular golf.Day, 28, has won three times in 2016 and seven times in his past 17 starts. He is making it look easy, but if winning from ahead were a piece of cake, the tour would have more pear-shaped players like Ken Duke (72) and Colt Knost (69), who tied for third with Matt Kuchar (68) and Justin Thomas (65) at 10 under.In the seasons first 26 tour events, Day was one of nine players to win after sleeping on at least a share of the third-round lead. Over all, 54-hole leaders have a 34.6 percent success rate in closing out tournaments. Day is two for two this season and five for five dating to last summers P.G.A. Championship, which Days fellow Australian Adam Scott described as Tiger-esque.As it happens, Day is in regular contact with Tiger Woods, the former world No. 1 who has become Days mentor and friend. Their relationship was built on Woodss offering golf-related advice to Day, who has proved a quick study.This week he texted me and said, Just stay in your world, and its a marathon,  Day said, adding, Just little things like that that obviously stick with me and keep me going.Day led the field in driving with a 311.6-yard average, and in scrambling, saving par 17 of the 20 times he missed the green. When Woods, who has been sidelined since August after having back surgery, returns to competition, he might want to turn the questions on Day.One of Days best responses to adversity came on the par-4 No. 7. After his approach found a greenside bunker, Day hit his next shot from an awkward stance, with one foot in the sand and the other on the grassy lip. The ball stopped 15 feet from the pin, and he made the putt. Day had two bogeys on the front, on Nos. 6 and 9, but bounced back with a bogey-free, three-under 33 on the final nine. After the round, he described his six-foot bogey putt on 9 as his most critical shot of the day, because if he had missed, he would have given his challengers renewed hope.Its very impressive, Thomas said, referring to Days five consecutive victories while holding the 54-hole lead. Thomas would know. He slept on the third-round lead at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia last fall and then held off the hard-charging Scott, a former world No. 1, for his first tour win. Thomas and Scott were paired together Sunday, and as they walked up the 18th fairway, Thomas said, they shared war stories about the difficulties of closing out a tournament.Thomas, 23, began the day 11 strokes behind Day, and said he never considered for a nanosecond that he could post a score low enough to pull out the come-from-behind win.With Jason Day leading the tournament, you wouldnt think thats a chance, Thomas said, adding: Its no coincidence hes No. 1 in the world. I mean, he drives it extremely far, extremely straight. He hits it to the moon so he can access pins that most people cant. His short game is ridiculous.Scott, who was No. 1 for 11 weeks in 2014, played a practice round on the eve of the tournament with Day and another Australian, Marc Leishman.You can see theres that calmness inside him, calm confidence, and the way hes walking around, hes got that kind of unbeatable look about him, Scott said.When Scott, 35, turned pro, he had a swing and a swagger that invited comparisons to Woods. He has had his moments, becoming the first Australian to win the Masters in 2013 and producing a torrid stretch this season in which he posted back-to-back wins and two seconds in seven starts.But what Day is doing is something altogether different, Scott said.Hes managed so far to keep that momentum going, and thats one of the hardest things to do when you are hot like that  to keep pushing, Scott said. But he has a very strong desire to achieve so much, and I think probably his goals are changing throughout this period, and hes expecting more and more of himself.In 2014, Day acknowledged that his primary aim had once been to make loads of money. His goals have evolved. Since becoming No. 1 and staring down the two-time major winner Jordan Spieth to win his first major at the P.G.A. Championship, Day is focused on his legacy. On Saturday, Day said he dearly wanted to win this event because it would enhance his credentials for inclusion in the World Golf Hall of Fame.The little bits of insight that I get into his whole life, I think hes got a handle on everything, Scott said, adding, Hes matured as a person so much in the last four or five years, and I think thats showing in his golf game."}

{"text": "On the screen, a young woman, just awake, smiled and rose from bed, chatting to her audience about starting her day, pausing occasionally to take long drags from an electronic pipe, pronouncing herself to be high.She was using Facebook Live, the new feature that invites friends to watch a user go live. Her name was Shaniah Lord, 19, from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and she was a frequent and enthusiastic chronicler of the mundane (Sunday, fun day, nothing better to do. Im bored.) who sometimes tried to scare up some excitement (Lets go get drinks, Im by mad bars.)On this day, March 26, her live feed took some strange turns. Looking back, her sister, Shaquana Lord, 28, called it a cry for help.In the video, Ms. Lord reached for something off-camera. It was a womans New Jersey drivers license, and she held it up to the screen.Anybody know a white girl that looks like this? she asked. We could get money.Several minutes later, she approached the camera again, this time with a black purse, and pulled out a handful of gift cards.Holler at me, she sang, if you need a giftie.Then she seemed to catch herself, saying: I dont need to be on Facebook like this. Im not that type of person. She added, People dont like me because I get money.There is no mention of theft in the video, or of how the cards and the license came to her. Ms. Lord, who grew up in Queens and sometimes lived with her grandmother on Stanton Street in Manhattan, had been arrested before, in January, and was charged with stealing a purse from a boutique a few blocks away. That case was pending. But her family hoped she had turned things around.Her sister said the pictures Ms. Lord frequently posted suggesting a glamorous life  a new ring, new nails, selfies in boutiques  hid a need for attention. She was running around with the wrong crowd, her sister said, and her actions in the video may have been for show.Just because she had them doesnt mean it was hers, Shaquana Lord said.When, a few days after the video, Ms. Lord was arrested again, it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity. A woman had stolen a wallet from the Once Upon a Tart cafe in SoHo, but after Ms. Lord was arrested, it became obvious from security video that the thief was a different, much taller woman. Ms. Lord returned home and to Facebook as if nothing had happened.On the day she was released from jail, she seemed to have celebrated an older cousins birthday, posting a picture and adding, It aint over yet thoooo! A few days later, she wrote, Life is really beginning to pick back up for me. I love it.But away from Facebook, things were very different, the police said. In fact, life seemed more to resemble the March 26 video, with the gift cards and license, than the posts expressing hope. Looking back, that video seemed to all but announce, like an overture to a concert, the direction in which she was headed.On April 21 around 2 a.m., a woman in the Greenwich Treehouse bar in the West Village realized her purse was gone, her iPhone with it, the police said. The woman used the Find My iPhone app and tracked it to an address on West 14th Street  another bar, McKennas Pub. She went there and recognized a woman from the first bar, she told the police. She told a doorman, who alerted the police.The suspect was arrested. It was Ms. Lord. The police recovered the womans purse and more.There was a backpack that had been reported missing two hours earlier from Bills Bar and Burger on Ninth Avenue, with a laptop and wallet. Its owner had been eating, the bag on the floor, and looked down to find it missing. Officers also found property from a purse that had been taken from a couch at Gaslight Lounge in the meatpacking district the night before, the police said.Ms. Lord was charged with grand larceny. She remained at Rikers Island last week, her Facebook page dormant and her sister hoping her life stabilizes.In the family, shes the one thats full of life, Shaquana Lord said. She got a whiff of the outside world, and she was going to do what she was going to do.Ms. Lord would seem to agree. In that video, she raised one more item to the camera: a passport. She flipped through the pages and sang, Come see the world with me."}

{"text": "Five years ago, Dick Wolfs Law and Order empire was coming apart.Though Law and Order: Special Victims Unit was still going strong, the parent show and all other accompanying spinoffs had been yanked off the air (Does anyone recall Law and Order: LA?). At a time when television was in the midst of a creative renaissance with critically praised character-based shows, Mr. Wolfs meat-and-potato procedurals looked a little stale.And whats happened to Mr. Wolf since?Hes back, and then some. Mr. Wolf currently has four shows on the air, including three based in Chicago that are all delivering ratings. NBC announced on Thursday that it would add a fifth Wolf show to its lineup next season with Chicago Justice.The procedural, it turns out, is doing just fine.When Mr. Wolf, 69, reflects on his improbable latest act, he can only sit back and laugh.One of the reasons that Im still at the table is I have infinite patience, he said in an interview. It is just amazing that if you stick around long enough people will catch on.The success of Mr. Wolfs shows has propelled NBC to a strong season. It will finish in second place, behind CBS, in total viewers and in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic important to advertisers. (If CBS had not had the Super Bowl, NBC would have finished No. 1 in the demographic.) Not counting years that the network got a boost from the Super Bowl or the Olympics, thats NBCs best finish to a season since 2004.And when NBC has its upfront presentation for advertisers on Monday, executives will speak with pride about tacking on yet another show from a prolific veteran.People roll their eyes and go, Another Dick Wolf show, another Dick Wolf show, but who else has done anything close to this? said NBC Entertainments chairman, Robert Greenblatt. Its really remarkable.Mr. Wolfs sudden resurgence is even bringing new life to his old franchise. NBC is developing a Law and Order true crime series (the first season is based on the Menendez brothers), and next season will broadcast a reality show, Law and Order: You the Jury.Its been a long way back.In 2009, the network was in serious trouble on the drama front. It had all but given up its 10 p.m. time slot, handing it over to the failed Jay Leno experiment. Mr. Greenblatt said Mr. Wolfs slate of shows was vital to stabilizing NBCs dramas and revving the 10 p.m. machine back to life.The fact that we could multiply the Dick Wolf shows, and they would all work, is enormously helpful in just trying to keep our head above water, which is basically the goal of any broadcast network these days as we see the audience fragmented in so many directions, he said.While the three Chicago shows have not drawn critical praise, they have more than made up for it with ratings. Chicago Fire, in its fourth season, and Chicago P.D., in its third, both won their time slots and had their most viewed seasons: about 10 million viewers per episode for Fire and nine million for P.D. The first-year Chicago Med was the fifth-highest rated new show among adults under 50. Even Law and Order: SVU, in its whopping 17th season, increased its ratings in the demographic by 5 percent.We make Mercedes S-Class sedans, Mr. Wolf said of his shows. Theyre designed to run basically forever and be comfortable and you dont have to think about much. We dont make Ferraris. I love Homeland but after six years its got, what, 52 episodes or something?That would be 60 episodes over five seasons, but point taken. By comparison, Chicago Fire has produced 92 episodes over its four seasons. In this era of prestige television, Mr. Wolfs shows prove that closed-ended procedurals (perhaps with the exception of Chicago Fire, which is a more character-driven show) still work. And it confounds Mr. Wolf that shows producing 70 episodes over seven years  or 10 episodes for a limited series  are called hits. Mr. Wolf prefers his brand of assembly-line programming.I think its a failure if its only 100 hours, Mr. Wolf said, referring to 100 episodes, at a talk earlier this year at the Paley Center for Media in Los Angeles. The idea is to go eight, 10, 12 years or longer.His shows skew a little older  the median age of viewers for the Chicago shows is around 57  and they are not lavished with praise by reviewers.Critics dont like them, he said. I cant help that, but they were not critical raves.Nor do his shows get much Emmy love, another thing that seems to gnaw at him. Despite the remarkable endurance of Law and Order, it rarely received meaningful Emmy attention for its writers, directors or stars.And yet it was just magic, he said sarcastically. One of the five best shows every year just happened.Mr. Wolf, instead, is proud of making a good business. In a phone interview recently, he rattled off a series of statistics  the number of eyeballs he gets per week (more than 40 million when delayed viewing is factored in), the incredible longstanding success of SVU, Mariska Hargitays long run on that show  to illustrate what success means to him.Is it old-fashioned? he said. Or it is comfort food? I much prefer to see it as comfort television. It doesnt disappoint you. And you can keep coming back and coming back.Mr. Wolfs return to the forefront of network television happened somewhat by accident.Peter Jankowski, the president of Wolf Entertainment and a longtime colleague of Mr. Wolf, said that they were taken aback when NBC canceled Law and Order after its 20th season, in 2010. Mr. Greenblatt, NBC Entertainments chairman, asked them to think about a new franchise and suggested a firefighting show, Mr. Jankowski said. FX had just aired a successful firehouse show based in New York (Rescue Me), so they settled on Chicago so the two would not be compared.It was far from a sure thing that Chicago Fire would work, but Mr. Jankowski said that Mr. Wolf was already plotting his future.I remember standing on the set on the first day of shooting of Chicago Fire and Dick was telling me that the next one were going to do is a Chicago cop show, a Chicago hospital show, and a Chicago lawyer show, Mr. Jankowski said. Thats sort of an insight into how Dick thinks. He is very expansive and he looks down the road. He thinks in terms of brands, not necessarily individual series.Perhaps its worth noting here: Before Mr. Wolf was a TV showman, he worked in advertising.For years I went hoarse saying Law and Order is a brand, Mr. Wolf said. Its like Crest. There are 15 types of Crest now but theyre all really good. If you want good toothpaste, you take that and youre going to get good toothpaste.Though he is seven months shy of becoming a septuagenarian, he has no interest in walking into the sunset, even though he would be assured of going out a winner. He suggested he has another franchise hes putting together.Ive got a 6- and an 8-year-old, he said. I dont plan on having their father retire in the near future.Thats welcome news to NBCs Mr. Greenblatt, who said hed seen this act before.These guys dont ever want to stop doing this, he said. I was working with Aaron Spelling at Fox in what I call the third act of his career with 90210 and Melrose Place. He was in his 80s when he died and he had hit shows on the air. He didnt want any more money or anything. He just loved to eat, sleep and breathe storytelling and television.And thats who Dick is, Mr. Greenblatt continued. Sixty-nine is nothing."}
{"text": "Its pretty clear at this point that whatever Michelle Obama wears is going to be greeted with shouts of excitement. That when she appears in a gown for a formal occasion, the effect will be described with words like stuns and glistens and sparkles. And so it was indeed last Friday at the Nordic state dinner, where David Letterman and Snapchats Evan Spiegel and his girlfriend, Miranda Kerr (among others), dined with the heads of five Nordic states, Demi Lovato sang, and Mrs. Obama wore a draped bodice off-the-shoulder peach-toned Naeem Khan.Showstopper,  E! online cried.It was a nice dress. But it was also, I cant help but feel, a missed opportunity.Before you start screaming sexism, because this is about a womans dress, as opposed to the dress of her husband, let me say that this is actually about using every possible political tool available, and it just so happens that when it comes to dress, women have significantly more tools than men. Its not reductive; its realistic.Mrs. Obama has become adept, over the two terms of her husbands administration, at transforming what has traditionally been a decorative job (hostess) into a piece of diplomatic art, largely through the use of her clothes to promote homegrown designers whose background bridges the United States and the guest country.This has worked both to introduce Mrs. O-obsessives to new, and lesser known, names, hence helping the designers, and to reflect the ties between countries, hence underscoring the message of the event. She hasnt always done it, but she has done it enough, and it has been effective enough, that it has inspired a generation of political spouses, from Samantha Cameron, the wife of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, to Sophie Grgoire Trudeau, wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, to do the same.But she didnt do it at the Nordic dinner Friday night. She went with a familiar name  she has worn Naeem Khan on multiple occasions (including the India state dinner in 2009), and her daughters wore Naeem Khan to their first state dinner, with the Canadian first family  but not one with any apparent relationship to her guests. Its too bad, because this dinner was rife with the potential for sartorial substance and communication.And not just because she could have introduced oft-overlooked Scandinavian designers to a new audience. Yes, they exist, and not just for pared-down daywear: There is a Copenhagen Fashion Week and a Stockholm Fashion Week, and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, who is known for wearing Danish names, was voted Most Stylish Royal (beating out the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton) by Hello magazine readers in 2014 and 2015. Among her favorite designers is Ole Yde, of YDE Copenhagen, who is known for his poetic approach to clothing and his way with an evening dress.(Meanwhile, Petra Mede, co-host of this years Eurovision song contest, held in Sweden, wore looks from the local designers Lars Wallin, Ida Lanto and Valerie Aflalo.)But also because one of the points of discussion of the state visit was climate change, an issue on which the Nordic countries have long been in the lead. Indeed, at the same time as the visit, Copenhagen was playing host to a series of fashion-related events around the subject of sustainability and style, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalitions annual members meeting, the Youth Fashion Summit, Planet Textiles: The Sustainable Textile Summit, and the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, which focused on responsible innovation (full disclosure: I was part of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit). As fashion wakes up to the issue, the state dinner could have been a very effective platform for reflecting the idea of responsible fashion.Imagine, for example, if the first lady had chosen a gown from the green carpet challenge, like the ones worn by Emma Watson and Lupita Nyongo to the Met Gala that were designed by Calvin Klein and made from fabric formed from recycled plastic bottles (and that were among the more lauded dresses on that not particularly lauded red carpet)?Or even more provocatively, and perhaps appropriately, a gown from H&Ms new Conscious Exclusive collection (a line that focuses on merging glamour and good by using eco-sensitive materials), as modeled by Crown Princess Mary during a dinner in the palace for the fashion summit, which would tick both the climate change box and the Scandinavian designer box, not to mention the economically accessible box.It would have been a powerful message to send, but it didnt happen.Indeed, along with Mrs. Obamas appearance at the White House Correspondents Association dinner in Givenchy couture, the choice of Naeem Khan seems to indicate that she may be less interested in forwarding a particular agenda at this point in her husbands fourth quarter than perhaps getting ready for her future in private life.Thats fair enough. But there is over half a year left to go before the Obamas exit the White House. Mrs. Obama raised the bar, and expectations, when it comes to first ladies image (or first spouses), and how it could be used. Lets hope she doesnt lower it now."}
{"text": "A combination of David Beckham and the Japanese womens national team inspired one of the most unlikely title wins in the history of modern soccer.That wouldnt be the 5,000-to-1 triumph in Englands Premier League that Leicester City celebrated this month, but Chan Yuen-tings becoming the first female coach to lead a mens soccer team to a professional top-flight league championship.Chan, 27, fell in love with soccer as a schoolgirl in Hong Kong, partly because of Beckham, but Japans win at the 2011 Womens World Cup has proved to be a bigger influence.That was amazing for us in Asia, Chan said in a telephone interview. That inspired me. We all watched, and I knew the way I wanted my team to play.Her Eastern Sports Club team closed out its season on Saturday but had already clinched the Hong Kong Premier League championship with a 2-1 win over South China on April 22. When the referee blew the final whistle, I felt I was dreaming, Chan said. It was unbelievable. Reporters came to me, took pictures and asked questions. I was still nervous and couldnt smile.There are nine professional teams in the mens league but no such competition for women. That prompted Chan, whose parents wanted her to pursue a more traditional career, to start coaching early. She started in 2010 as a video analyst for Pegasus, another Hong Kong club. In 2015, she led the clubs under-18 team to the youth league championship.Easterns previous head coach, Yeung Ching-kwong, departed in December to be an assistant at a second-tier club in Meizhou, China, and Chan, then an assistant coach at the club, was promoted, as she was the only member of the coaching staff with a coaching license from the Asian Football Confederation.Chan may have been the most qualified, but there were doubts. I asked the club, Is this a good decision? I worried about my lack of experience, she said. I didnt want to bring trouble to the team, but they have really supported me and trusted me.Her first game was a 6-1 victory, and seven more victories came in the following nine matches. She has become a minor celebrity in the region, according to Mark Sutcliffe, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Football Association.Eyebrows were raised when Ms. Chan was appointed, but I wasnt surprised. She had been successful at youth level, Sutcliffe wrote in an email. Football remains male-dominated, and it takes a special person and a forward-thinking club to break the mold. We will know when true equality has been achieved when stories like this are no longer newsworthy.That may take some time, given the lack of women coaching men in sports. In 2015, Nancy Lieberman was appointed as an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings, the second woman to join the coaching staff of an N.B.A. team after Becky Hammon at the San Antonio Spurs. In Japan, Natalie Nakase was head coach of Saitama Broncos in the countrys professional league before returning to the United States in 2012 to work as a video coordinator for the Los Angeles Clippers.It is similar in soccer. Shelley Kerr is in charge of Stirling University F.C. in the fifth tier of the Scottish league system. In 2014, Clermont Foot in Frances second tier appointed Helena Costa, a Portuguese woman, as head coach, but she quit after a month, saying there had been a lack of respect from the club. She was replaced by another female coach, Corinne Diacre.I think it is possible for more women to work in mens football, and if this success helps, then I will be very happy, Chan said. Its an important step for women in football. Once I took over as the head coach, lots of reporters said, You are a female coach and you are only 27. It doesnt matter if I am female or male, young or old. The important thing is that I have to do my job well. If the team cant get results, then you have a problem.The results were there. The 6-1 win in her opening game helped make the transition smooth. At the beginning, perhaps the players were a little confused, she said. I was nervous and stressed, and I paid a lot of attention to the first week of training. But the players never challenged me or asked why I was head coach. They knew the situation, showed a professional attitude. They encouraged me all the way.With the title won, the immediate plan is to stay at the club for next season and try to qualify for the AFC Champions League, Asias top club competition. Failing that, the AFC Cup beckons, a second-tier tournament.Ultimately, Chan would like to work in the professional womens leagues in China or England, though England may be a more fitting home for another unlikely title winner.Eastern have been the best team consistently over the course of the season, Sutcliffe said. Its not quite Leicester-esque, but its a great achievement nonetheless."}
{"text": "ARUSHA, Tanzania  Less than two years after it blocked a sale of American-made attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel because of human rights concerns, the Obama administration says it is poised to sell up to 12 light attack aircraft to Nigeria as part of an effort to support the countrys fight against the Boko Haram militant group.But the pending sale of the Super Tucano attack warplanes  which would require congressional approval  is already coming under criticism from human rights organizations that say President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has not yet done enough to stop the abuses and corruption that flourished in the military under his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan.Officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon have been bracing for a fight with congressional Democrats, in particular Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, over the sale of the planes.The proposed sale reflects the warming of the relationship between the Nigerian and American militaries, which had frayed under Mr. Jonathan. The Pentagon often bypassed Nigeria in the fight against Boko Haram, choosing to work directly with neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger.In addition to citing corruption and sweeping human rights abuses by Nigerian soldiers, American officials were hesitant to share intelligence with the Nigerian military, saying Boko Haram had infiltrated it. That accusation prompted indignation from Nigeria.But that was before Mr. Buhari, a former Nigerian Army major general, defeated Mr. Jonathan in an election last year.Since coming into power, Mr. Buhari has devoted himself to rooting out graft in Africas largest economy.He has fired a number of Nigerian military officers accused of corruption, and American military officials say they are now working closely with some of their counterparts in Nigeria. The Obama administration is also considering sending dozens of Special Operations advisers to the front lines of Nigerias fight against Boko Haram, an insurgency that has killed thousands of civilians in the countrys northeast as well as in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.Mr. Buhari has also pledged to investigate allegations of human rights abuses and has said he will not tolerate them.A move to sell the Super Tucano attack aircraft to Nigeria, first reported by Reuters, would continue the dtente between the two militaries, administration officials said. The Super Tucano, a turboprop aircraft, is designed for light attack, counterinsurgency, close air support and reconnaissance missions. It could prove useful as the Nigerian military tries to clear Boko Haram out of the Sambisa Forest, which is believed to hold large numbers of the militants, as well as kidnapped girls and women.The administration has not made a formal decision to send a notification to Congress, but a senior administration official said he expected one soon. President Obama is considering a trip to Nigeria in July.But already aides to Mr. Leahy, a sponsor of a human rights law that prohibits the State Department and Pentagon from providing military assistance to foreign militaries with poor human rights records, have expressed concern.We dont have confidence in the Nigerians ability to use them in a manner that complies with the laws of war and doesnt end up disproportionately harming civilians, nor in the capability of the U.S. government to monitor their use, said Tim Rieser, a top Leahy aide.The United States is committed to working with Nigeria and its neighbors against Boko Haram, said David McKeeby, a spokesman for the State Departments Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. The Nigerian security forces and regional forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger have made important progress in pushing Boko Haram out of many towns and villages of northeast Nigeria and the broader Lake Chad basin region.Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army chief of staff, is attending a meeting of top African military officials, including from Nigeria, here in Arusha this week. Aboard his flight on Saturday, General Milley declined to comment on whether Nigerias human rights record had improved enough to warrant the sale, but said one of the reasons he was attending the meeting was to learn more about the African militaries with which the Pentagon is working.Consideration of selling the attack aircraft to Nigeria is a sharp turnabout from two years ago, when the United States blocked the sale of American-made Cobra attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel, amid concerns about Nigerias protection of civilians when conducting military operations. That infuriated the Nigerian government, and Nigerias ambassador to the United States responded sharply, accusing Washington of hampering the effort against Boko Haram.Lets say we give certain kinds of equipment to the Nigerian military that is then used in a way that affects the human situation, James F. Entwistle, the American ambassador to Nigeria, told reporters in October in explaining the decision to block the helicopter sale. If I approve that, Im responsible for that. We take that responsibility very seriously.Under Mr. Jonathan, the former president, the Nigerian military was accused by human rights groups of detaining and killing thousands of innocent civilians in sweeps of the militant group, a practice that Amnesty International said was continuing. This year the military rounded up several hundred men and boys in arrests that Amnesty, in a report it released last week, called arbitrary, the hazardous profiling based on sex and age of the individual rather than on evidence of crime.The report said 149 people had died this year in detention in the Nigerian militarys Giwa barracks in Maiduguri, a city that has been a staging ground for the fight against Boko Haram. Among the victims were 11 children under age 6, including four infants, Amnesty said. The prisoners most likely died of disease, starvation, dehydration or gunshot wounds, the report said.In a news release, the Nigerian military called the report completely baseless, unfounded and source-less with the intent of denting the image of the Nigerian Armed Forces.Sarah Margon, the Washington director at Human Rights Watch, disagreed.Indications that the U.S. is going to sell attack aircrafts to Nigeria is concerning given the absence of meaningful reform within Nigerias security sector, Ms. Margon said. The U.S. must make clear that if the sale is to occur, critical steps, not just rhetorical commitments, on core human rights concerns must be an integral component for approving the sale."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Professor Zaid al-Ali presents a sobering diagnosis of Iraqi governments problems (The Solution to Iraqs Political Crisis, May 5), but his prescribed cure  changing the electoral law by executive fiat  is worse than the disease.Once constitutional requirements are dismissed as nominal, the rule of law is at risk. Future executive overreach would be encouraged. And however worthy the proposed reforms, they would be tainted by their illegal introduction. Politicians and factions who lose out would have legitimate complaints against the system. In a democracy as fragile as Iraqs, those complaints could turn violent.Professor al-Ali cites the 2009 switch to an open-list electoral system as precedent, but that happened legally and with the support of most of the parties. It shows that reform by constitutional means is still possible. The legal course may be harder, but its still the safe and right one.The rule of law is at the heart of democracy.ALEXANDER GARD-MURRAY Oxford, England"}
{"text": "By the end of last week, Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook would conduct a full investigation into accusations that editors at the company prevented news stories from conservative outlets from appearing in a section of the social networks service.But the statement, issued after a weeklong crush of attention about the accusation, leapfrogged a perhaps more obvious question  one that Facebooks 1.65 billion monthly users around the world may not have considered.Facebook has editors?It does, and it isnt alone. Most major social media platforms have, in recent years, amassed editorial teams of their own, groups that select, tame and fill gaps in the material produced by users and media companies.The teams are often tiny compared with the rest of their sprawling organizations. But most of these employees  whether they are called curators, reporters, editors or something else  make editorial choices that reach huge audiences. How and why these decisions are made are generating new questions for the companies, and their users, to grapple with.Mainstream news organizations have endured a skeptical public for decades, said Kjerstin Thorson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California.Now, she says, social media companies may face similar, and perhaps jarring, scrutiny.Facebook declined to say how many people have editorial roles, as did Instagram, which Facebook owns. But several other companies provided some details about their operations that suggest the scope and variety of their editorial ambitions.Snapchat said it has around 75 people who produce content, collecting and annotating videos and photos of live events and sometimes adding on-the-scene reporting themselves. Twitter employs just under a dozen people in the United States and around two dozen worldwide to collect and describe postings about notable topics.Vine, the video service owned by Twitter, employs five to 10 people to highlight videos and producers that might have been overlooked by the audience, or that the company simply wants more people to see.Where curation picks up, said Ankur Thakkar, the editorial lead of Vine, is that you need human eyes and ears to pick up on a cultural trend that a machine might not see.In some cases, these teams coexist with media professionals working elsewhere on the platform. Peter Hamby, a former CNN political reporter, oversees a team of six journalists within Snapchat, while media companies  including CNN  produce content for the companys Discover feature.The novelty of these arrangements can obscure their straightforward influence. Such companies, with hundreds of millions of users, attract enormous amounts of human attention. People whose Snapchat videos are featured in a curated live event say they have had millions of views. A performer featured by Vine can expect a surge of new followers; a trend or meme given the same treatment can garner thousands of new responses from users.Facebooks Trending Topics, the feature that drew all the attention last week, is relegated to a small box in desktop browsers and users search page on mobile devices. But the positioning provides confirmation, in the language of Facebooks own guidelines, that the topic is tied to a current news event in the real world.Broad guidelines for Twitter curators are published on the site and state that their posts, called Moments, will not take a view on a controversial subject and that curators will select tweets that represent all sides of the argument in Moments that reflect a public debate. Snapchat did not share editorial guidelines, but pointed to a team of experienced reporters as evidence of its standards. (A job listing for an editorial lead at Snapchat, who will be charged to define the editorial voice of Snapchats Live Stories, asks for five years journalism or storytelling experience.)The report accusing suppression of news stories within Facebooks Trending Topics was published by the website Gizmodo last Monday, prompting a denial by Facebook followed by the release of its 28-page set of internal editorial guidelines. Facebook said on Thursday that its editorial guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives.For the companies, adding additional curated or original editorial content has an obvious appeal, helping them extract more value from people already using the platform, as well as potentially attracting new ones. Each of these companies has to give people that arent coming there a reason to come there  new users, or infrequent users, said Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.But, Mr. Pachter said, the presence of editorial operations risks emphasizing just how significant the companies have become as gatekeepers for news and entertainment.To edit it, and write it, and create it, and curate it, its a big responsibility, he said. I dont think they realize what theyre getting into.Last weeks debate surrounding Trending Topics gave users and critics a chance to analyze the Facebook platform, which has established significant reach, in new ways. Social networks like Facebook have been widely seen as impartial systems that reflect users ideas, preferences and relationship back at them. But suddenly, the companies were viewed not just as tech companies, which the public is broadly endeared to, or as media companies, which are regarded with deep skepticism by much of the public, but also as something in between.Details about the Facebook teams editorial practices, for example, immediately led to questions about the tools they used  the software that identified popular stories in the first place. And analysis of those tools led to questions about the central mechanics of Facebook  the software that uses more than a billion users personal connections and preferences to decide what to show them next.Many of these interrogations ended up in the same thorny thicket: Who designed the system this way, and why? That may help explain why other companies refrained from wading into public discussions around Facebook last week, hoping to avoid a similar storm.There are a lot of similarities between this situation and how little we knew about how traditional news organizations worked in the middle of the 20th century, Ms. Thorson said, the last era before media trust plummeted.She added: The question really is, how much sustained media attention to these processes will it require before these platforms must react in some way to preserve the trust they have?I suspect quite a bit."}
{"text": "The annual television upfront presentations for advertisers begin Monday, in which the broadcast networks will introduce new shows along with two newish entertainment presidents (Glenn Geller at CBS, who got his job last year; and ABCs Channing Dungey, who took over in February). Heres a rundown of each networks previous season, and what will be promoted this week.WHATS WORKING Business as usual here: CBS was the most-watched network for the 13th time in the last 14 years  by as wide a margin as nearly three million viewers  and finished on top for the 18-to-49-year-old demographic as well, which is important to advertisers. The Big Bang Theory, in its ninth season, was once again the No. 1 comedy on TV, and NCIS was the most-viewed drama for the seventh consecutive year. Other perennials like Blue Bloods, Criminal Minds and Survivor still perform well.WHATS NOT  Though the network continues to ride its thoroughbreds, it has been a few years since it has introduced a meaningful hit. CSI: Cyber, the last spinoff from that franchise, was canceled after two sluggish seasons. The comedy Angel From Hell was canceled and other comedic efforts fizzled, beyond a solid first season from Life in Pieces. And though Supergirl started off strong, its viewership has declined and now the show will be shuffled over to CBSs cousin network, the CW.WHAT TO LOOK FOR THIS WEEK CBS will introduce new comedies with two stars (Kevin James in Kevin Can Wait and Matt LeBlanc in Man With a Plan) and a few reboots: MacGyver, based on the 1980s show, and Training Day, based on the 2001 movie. The network will also promote its Star Trek revival, which is being devised for its stand-alone app, CBS All Access.WHATS WORKING Empire continues to deliver. Though it slowed a bit in its second season, it will finish as the No. 1 show among adults under 50. The six-episode run of The X-Files turned out to be surprisingly muscular. It brought in meaningful ratings, and Fox executives are hopeful that there will be plenty more episodes going forward. Fox also managed to climb out of the basement among the big four networks and will finish in third place in the 18-to-49 demographic.WHATS NOT Two big comedy debuts  The Grinder and Grandfathered  received nice reviews but were canceled after poor ratings. Minority Report was likewise let go after one year. And even if Scream Queens is popular among a younger audience and will get a second season, it did not make any lasting impression on the ratings, particularly considering the lengthy and expensive marketing blitz it received.WHAT TO LOOK FOR THIS WEEK With American Idol shutting down, Fox is going to have a lot of hours to fill, and it plans on doing it with reboot mania. Projects include reboots for 24, Prison Break, Lethal Weapon and The Exorcist. Fox will also have another show, Star, from Lee Daniels, the creator of Empire. And there will be one surefire ratings boon that will be talked up at its presentation: Fox will broadcast the Super Bowl in February.WHATS WORKING ABCs lineup of comedies with diverse casts like black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat continues to give the network an identity. Thursday night remains strong, thanks to Shonda Rhimes, even if How to Get Away With Murder and Scandal showed signs of wear and tear this year. Quantico had a solid debut and qualifies as the networks standout first-year show.WHATS NOT ABC said goodbye to Paul Lee, its entertainment president, in February. The network experienced the biggest losses in viewers and in the 18-to-49 demographic among the networks (percentage drops of 14 percent and 18 percent). It canceled several new shows like Wicked City (the first network show to be axed this season), The Muppets (one of the seasons biggest flops) and the veteran series Castle and Nashville.WHAT TO LOOK FOR THIS WEEK ABC will introduce Ms. Dungey, the first black network president. Ms. Dungeys new lineup will include the Kiefer Sutherland drama Designated Survivor, about a low-level United States cabinet member who takes over the presidency after a large-scale attack. ABC will also pick up a period drama from Ms. Rhimes, Still Star-Crossed, about the Montagues and the Capulets after the deaths of Romeo and Juliet.WHATS WORKING For the first time in a few years, quite a bit. In what was an otherwise anemic year for rookie network shows, Blindspot was the clear winner among the first-year class. Dick Wolfs Chicago-based franchise continues to prosper, and Little Big Shots was the breakout reality hit of the year. The Voice remains a very strong performer and The Wiz Live! was a win for the networks annual live musical series. Over all, if CBS had not had the Super Bowl, NBC would have finished the year in first place in the 18-to-49 demographic.WHATS NOT The Neil Patrick Harris variety show, Best Time Ever, was an expensive flop. Though the network has shown progress with the critically praised Superstore and The Carmichael Show, the comedy cupboard is otherwise empty. The Eva Longoria show Telenovela did not work, nor did a reboot, Heroes: Reborn.WHAT TO LOOK FOR THIS WEEK This years upfront presentation will include all of NBCUniversals properties, not just the broadcast networks. But NBC is trying to bring its comedy rolls back to life with The Good Place, a show from the Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur starring Ted Danson, and Great News, produced by Tina Fey. The network has high hopes for Timeless, a time-travel thriller, and the costly drama Emerald City. The Celebrity Apprentice will return without Donald J. Trump: Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new host. Mr. Wolfs Chicago Justice will represent his fifth show in NBCs lineup."}
{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon  The Syrian government allowed hundreds of students to leave two besieged areas near Damascus to take their year-end exams over the weekend, even as other suburbs of the capital came under fierce attack.The government is eager to show that it is still providing services, salaries and pensions amid a devastating war, including to areas it does not control.On Saturday and Sunday, government forces allowed about 360 students from the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Moadamiyeh, and 68 students from the rebel-held town of Madaya, to travel to government areas to take their high school exams, according to activists and state media.Both Moadamiyeh and Madaya are besieged by government forces, who have allowed relief groups only limited access, despite reports that civilians have died from starvation and lack of medical care.The ninth graders from Madaya who went to the nearby government-held town of Rawda on Saturday were searched by soldiers at the first checkpoint outside the town, said Wafiqa Hashem, a teacher at the Mohammad Nassif secondary school in Madaya.Eighty percent of students in Madaya have missed stretches of class in the last school year because of hunger or cold weather, Ms. Hashem said. She said that during the worst periods of the siege only five or six students would attend class at a time. Doctors Without Borders reported 16 siege-related deaths in Madaya in January alone.They were fighting for their lives, but they will make all efforts to pass their exams, Ms. Hashem said.Schools also struggled with power cuts and other shortages.Since the government began allowing aid into the town this year, the health of students has improved. They are playing sports again, Ms. Hashem said. But teachers have not had time to catch up on their curriculums.The United Nations and international relief organizations are calling on the government, the Islamic State group and rebels to allow sustained and unfettered access to the nearly half a million people  mostly civilians  trapped in besieged areas around the country.Syrias education minister, Hazwan al-Wuz, hailed the first week of exams as a rejection of the ignorance that the nations enemies are striving for, according to state media. The state media reported that rebels in eastern Aleppo prohibited students from crossing into government-held western Aleppo to take their finals."}
{"text": "This is what to expect in the week ahead:FINANCIALArgentina will issue its first major corporate bonds in international markets since it resolved a lengthy debt feud with hedge funds and came out of default. Banco Hipotecario, a commercial bank and mortgage lender, will issue up to $200 million worth, Manuel Herrera, the assistant chief executive, said in an interview. The order book for the bonds, maturing in 2020, will open on Monday or Tuesday.Under its new president, Mauricio Macri, Argentina returned to global credit markets last month after a 15-year hiatus. Its sale of $16.5 billion in bonds  the biggest ever in so-called emerging markets  was priced at an average of 7.14 percent, demonstrating investors appetite for high yields despite risk.Banco Hipotecario did sell bonds last year while Argentina was still in default. They were issued at 9.75 percent, but this time pricing could tighten to less than 8 percent, market analysts said. The demand is very high for Argentina, Mr. Herrera said. Everyone is trying to tap this opportunity. Jonathan GilbertECONOMYOn Tuesday, economists will get a host of new data on how the economy performed last month. The Commerce Department will report on housing starts in April, with experts looking for a slight pickup in activity that would lift the annual rate of new construction to 1.1 million units. Housing starts fell 8.8 percent in March to the lowest level since October 2015. The data for April should help indicate whether that was a blip or a sign of softness ahead in residential construction.The Labor Department will release data on inflation in April. The Consumer Price Index is thought to have increased by 0.2 percentage point in April while the core C.P.I., which does not include more volatile food and energy prices, is estimated to have risen 0.1 percent. The increase in the broader index was driven by higher gasoline costs in particular, but inflation remains  tame, according to economists.Also on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will release data on industrial production and capacity utilization in April. The Fed expects a modest improvement in both measures, with industrial production rising by 0.1 percentage point and capacity utilization increasing slightly to 74.9 percent. Both have been anemic lately, hurt by the slide in energy-related activity and weak demand from overseas because of the stronger dollar. But factory activity may have rebounded slightly in April. Nelson D. SchwartzJapans economy probably grew by the thinnest of margins in the first quarter of the year. The country will report gross domestic product numbers on Wednesday, and economists latest estimates point to annualized growth of 0.2 percent. Anemic consumer spending, a tumbling stock market and the fallout from Chinas slowdown all stood in the way of faster expansion, experts say. The economy contracted by 1.1 percent in the final quarter of 2015, and might have shrunk by a similar amount in the first quarter of 2016 if not for the extra day provided by the leap year. Jonathan SobleThe Federal Reserves April meeting passed quietly, with no increase in the Feds benchmark rate and no clear signal that another rate increase was imminent. The minutes of that meeting, which the Fed will publish on Wednesday, may help to explain the Feds caution. Job growth remains fairly strong, while reported economic growth has been weaker than expected. Some Fed officials have said since the meeting that they have not ruled out raising rates at the Federal Reserves next meeting in June. Investors, however, are increasingly convinced that the Fed will wait for more data to clarify the divergence, and that the central bank is not likely to raise rates before September. Binyamin AppelbaumFinance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 7 leading industrialized nations are scheduled to meet in Sendai, Japan, on Friday and Saturday. They are expected to discuss a broad range of global risks, from swings in oil prices and currencies to the slowdown in China. A core issue will be whether countries can continue to rely on their central banks to stimulate growth, or whether governments need to play a bigger role by increasing spending or cutting taxes. The talks are a precursor to the Group of 7 leaders summit meeting in Japan on May 26 and 27. Jonathan SobleRETAILINGWalmart, the countrys largest retailer, will report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts will pay particular attention to the shopping giants e-commerce business, in which it has invested heavily to better compete with Amazon. Amazon has also posed a challenge for another low-cost rival, Target, which will release its first-quarter results on Wednesday. Rachel Abrams"}

Players from both teams rushed the field as Odor landed the first punch to Bautistas face.I was pretty surprised, Bautista said. I mean, obviously, thats the only reason that he got me, and he got me pretty good, so I have to give him that. It takes a little bit bigger man to knock me down.Odor was not available for comment after the game.Umpires needed about 10 minutes to restore order, and Blue Jays reliever Jesse Chavez hit Prince Fielder with the next pitch when the game resumed. He was ejected, with both teams having been warned when Bautista was hit by a pitch from Matt Bush.Toronto Manager John Gibbons accounted for one of eight ejections from the game, after an argument in the third inning, but he was back on the field during the brawl. The first-base coach Tim Leiper was tossed in a separate argument in the third, and the bench coach DeMarlo Hale, filling in for Gibbons, was ejected when Chavez (0-1) hit Fielder.Ian Desmond hit a three-run homer in the seventh to give Bush, a 30-year-old rookie, his first major league win two days after he made his major league debut.Athletic hits three homers Danny Valencia hit three home runs, including a two-run shot in the ninth inning, as visiting Oakland edged the Tampa Bay Rays, 7-6.Matt Kenseth held off Kyle Larson in a thrilling run down the stretch to win the crash-filled AAA 400 at Dover International Speedway in Delaware.Kenseth raced to his first Sprint Cup victory of the season and denied Larson his first career win.Kenseth and Larson battled for parts of the final five laps, and Kenseth, the 2003 Nascar champion, picked all the right lines and pulled away at the end.

{"text": "LONDON  After Saracens finally broke through with their first European championship, the teams owner and coaches are determined to make sure the title marks a beginning, and not an end.I dont want to wish my life away, but the team is so young that Im excited looking forward to what it will achieve in the next five years, the clubs owner, Nigel Wray, told BT television after his teams 21-9 victory over Racing 92 in the European Rugby Champions Cup in Lyon, France, on Saturday night.If we can stay humble enough and hungry enough, there is plenty more to come, promised Mark McCall, the coach of the London-based club.Saracens completed the first 9-0 season in the tournament since it adopted its current format, and they are the 11th different winners  and the fifth from England, and first since Wasps in 2007  in the Cups 21 years.Twenty years ago, Saracens were playing in a public park. If the ball was kicked onto the roof of the small grandstand, spectators were showered with rust. The team was like a yo-yo, switching between strong seasons in Englands second division and struggles for survival when it was promoted to the top league.While Wray insisted Saturday night that he had gained far more from the Saracens than he had given the club, it was his money that enabled their progressive transformation. Among rugby owners, he has been conspicuous both for his durability  many other early investors soon departed  and his early recognition that it would be a long time before his investment paid off.In foul conditions in Lyon, Saracens adjusted tactically to the driving rain, while Racing did not. Saracens were in control from the start, taking charge of the conflicts at the breakdown, kicking superbly and using their fast and predatory defense to ensure that their French opponents dangerous backs were stifled. Racings players kept looking for space but never could find any, and while Saracens dominance did not make for much of a spectacle, it ensured that they would emerge victorious.Saracens took the lead in the 24th minute, when flyhalf Owen Farrell kicked the second of his seven penalties, and they led 12-6 at halftime. Racing looked briefly capable of breaking the stranglehold around the 60th minute, when Racings Johan Goosen kicked his third penalty to close Saracens lead to 15-9, but Farrell ended any doubts by kicking two more penalties in the final 10 minutes.Racing could argue that it suffered from bad luck after losing its two most creative players. The scrumhalf Maxime Machenaud left after 22 minutes with a concussion, while it was clear from the start that New Zealand flyhalf Dan Carter was not fully fit, with Machenaud and Goosen sharing the goal-kicking. Carter limped on until the 43rd minute, when he departed with what Racings owner, Jacky Lorenzetti, said was a calf injury.They were just a bit better in every department of the game, Lorenzetti told Reuters.Sarries got to show us what a class team they are. They really suffocated us and really deserved it, Racings veteran winger, Joe Rokocoko, told BT. Losing players to injuries does not help, but like all good teams, Saracens can smell blood and suffocated us, particularly in the last 15 minutes.The man of the match award went to the phenomenal Saracens lock forward Maro Itoje, who continued his rapid rise from promising rookie to one of the best players in the world. It followed similar awards for Itoje, 21, in the quarterfinals and semifinals.There were numerous Saracens players who could have won the award, though. In most games, Farrells kicking could have made him a shoo-in.We were challenged and took it in our stride, Farrell said. We dug in and gave the calm performance we thought we would.The award might have gone to Itojes second-row partner, George Kruis, or the energetic No. 8 Billy Vunipola  or, frankly, almost anyone on Saracens. It was as McCall said, a real team effort.Im delighted not just for the players, but for all the staff and for Nigel Wray, McCall told BT. We didnt just muscle up against a very good team, but we played a really clever, mature game. We were tactically good, and our halfbacks put real pressure on their backfield."}
{"text": "Yahoo appears to be making progress in efforts to sell itself, despite some initial skepticism.The latest piece of evidence: Among those vying for the company is the unusual combination of the investor Warren E. Buffett and Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.That consortium is one of several suitors that have moved into the second round of bidding for Yahoo, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Gilbert is leading the bid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Buffetts conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, is offering to provide financing, as he has done with the investment firm 3G Capital in its takeovers of H. J. Heinz and Kraft, and is leaving the negotiations to Mr. Gilbert, according to the people.The unusual presence of Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Buffett in the bidding suggest just how far Yahoo and its advisers have cast their net to find potential buyers for the embattled Internet company.The two are joined in the second round by a range of other bidders, including Verizon Communications and private equity firms such as TPG Capital and a group that comprises Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners, people briefed on the process have previously said. Several other strategic bidders are also in the second round.Yahoo declined to comment. Representatives for Quicken Loans and Berkshire did not return requests for comment.The companies in the second round of bidding are seeking to buy one of the best-known names in Silicon Valley  though one that ceded a longtime hold on the Internet to younger rivals like Google and Facebook. Repeated efforts to reinvent itself, led by a string of chief executives, including the companys current leader, Marissa Mayer, have failed to take hold.As Yahoo and its bankers canvassed for preliminary bids, the company received criticism, including from some prospective bidders and from the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, over the state of the sales process.Yet Yahoo can point to progress. It settled a looming board fight with Starboard, offering the investment firm four director seats. One of those is held by Starboards chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, who now sits on the special board committee overseeing the potential sale.Yahoo executives, including Ms. Mayer, and advisers have been sitting down with bidders in the second round, furnishing those suitors with additional details.Among them is Mr. Gilbert, who built his multibillion-dollar fortune with the financial empire. But he is also an active investor in his own right, having taken stakes in a number of online start-ups.Yahoo would be orders of magnitude larger than those other technology investments and significantly more troubled. But Mr. Gilberts consortium, like other bidders, has been interested in the still-significant digital footprint that the company possesses, including its popular finance and sports sites.Backing him is his friend Mr. Buffett  who has long spoken of his aversion to technology companies, outside of an investment in IBM. But the role of Berkshire in the Gilbert bid would be financial, and Mr. Buffetts conglomerate would collect interest from its financing with the opportunity to convert those holdings into an equity stake in the company.Both men are familiar with Yahoo in other ways. Mr. Buffett turned to Yahoo Finance for the first-ever live stream of the question-and-answer session at Berkshires annual shareholder meeting on April 30.And one of Berkshires directors is Susan L.

{"text": "Golden State Warriorsvs. Oklahoma City ThunderSeason head-to-head: Warriors, 3-0Series starts Monday at 9 p.m. EasternDraymond Green has become an heir apparent of sorts to Charles Barkley. People have long been intrigued by the idea that Barkley, listed at 6 feet 6 inches, was actually far shorter, which made his rebounding ability even more impressive. The same has proved true of Green, who, despite being listed at 6 feet 7 inches, typically plays power forward and moves to center in Golden States vaunted death lineup. His lack of height has turned into an atypical compliment.The difference between Barkley and Green is that with Green, we know the rumors are true. At the 2012 draft combine, Green was measured at 6 feet 5.75 inches barefoot, and thickly soled shoes boosted him to 6 feet 7.5 inches.The same combine measurements help explain how Green is able to play so much bigger than his height. His wingspan was measured at 7 feet 1.25 inches, and his standing reach was 8 feet 10 inches, numbers associated with players several inches taller.Like Barkley, Green also talks big and has remarkably diverse skills for a power forward. But his ability to play far bigger than would seem possible will be tested by the Thunders big and talented frontcourt.Greens competition will be Steven Adams (height: 7 feet; standing reach: 9 feet 1.5 inches), Enes Kanter (6-11; 9-1.5), Serge Ibaka (6-10; no listed standing reach) and Kevin Durant (6-10; 9-2).The Warriors were 3-0 against the Thunder this season, and 6-1 against them over the last two years, but on Feb. 27 they had to survive being outrebounded, 62-32, by Oklahoma City in an overtime win, which is why many are citing size as such a big factor in this series.They beat us to long rebounds, they beat us up inside with Adams and Kanter, Coach Steve Kerr told reporters after Saturdays practice in reference to the hard-fought 121-118 victory in February. The other two games, we were solid.Kerr added, We probably wont outrebound them, but if we can keep it relatively close, thatll be important for us.Andrew Bogut, Golden States starting center, is working his way back from an injured adductor, but that is unlikely to play much of a factor since Kerr can attack Oklahoma Citys size with the speed of his death lineup. That unit played a combined 17 minutes against the Thunder this season and thoroughly dominated, hitting nearly 60 percent of its field-goal attempts while outscoring the Thunder by 17 points and grabbing 53.1 percent of rebounds.In many ways, this series is a more difficult matchup for Golden State than the San Antonio Spurs would have been, and the Warriors ability to make their small lineups hold up will be tested with a great deal more exposure than they got during the season.Thus far, Kerr has known how to manage his rotation, and the killer instinct of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in crunchtime, combined with Greens dirty work, should be enough to get the Warriors to the finals for a second consecutive season.Pick: Warriors in 6Cleveland Cavaliersvs. Toronto RaptorsSeason head-to-head: Raptors, 2-1Series starts Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. EasternThe Raptors flew below the radar for much of the season despite taking the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference with ease. They have a pair of All-Star guards, two effective young centers and the rapper Drake cheering from the sideline, which has somehow added up to many people overlooking them in favor of teams like the Miami Heat and Charlotte Hornets, who were perhaps a bit more exciting even if they were not quite as effective.Despite a few hiccups in the playoffs, the Raptors have shown that last seasons epic collapse is a thing of the past. It took them 14 games, but they eliminated the Indiana Pacers and the Heat, and for their trouble they now get to face LeBron James and the Cavaliers.The biggest question mark heading into the series is the health of Jonas Valanciunas, Torontos 24-year-old starting center. Before an ankle injury sustained in Game 3 of the Raptors matchup with the Heat, he was having a breakout performance in the playoffs, averaging 15 points and 12.1 rebounds a game. More important, he was doing his best work with the game on the line, which is a far cry from some of his teammates who have a reputation for wilting under pressure.If Valanciunas cannot return, he will continue to be replaced in the starting lineup by Bismack Biyombo, a defensive specialist who has thrived in a rotation with Valanciunas but would be in a bit over his head in a full-time role against the Cavaliers.While Toronto and the Heat were engaging in a seven-game war of attrition, which ended Sunday with the Raptors 116-89 victory, the Cavaliers have been sitting at home resting and hoping that their hot shooting can continue after nine days of inactivity.If Cleveland can continue to play as it did in the first two rounds, the Raptors are in trouble. The Cavaliers are 8-0 while averaging a whopping 117 points per 100 possessions, which tops even Golden State. Their defense has limited opponents to 98.4 points per 100 possessions, which is the third-best mark of the playoffs.They have done it by riding their outside shooting, hitting a league-leading 46.2 percent from 3-point range despite having averaged a remarkable 36.3 attempts a game, which is nearly five more attempts a game than Golden State took during the regular season.Expecting J. R. Smith to continue making more than 50 percent of his 3-point attempts is a bit absurd, but part of the strength of Clevelands offense is that on any given night, it can be dominated by Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, James or even Smith. So even if one or more players hit a cold streak, the team has the depth to keep going.With Kyle Lowrys shooting seeming to come around, and Toronto getting plenty of contributions from DeMar DeRozan and DeMarre Carroll, Toronto could be competitive against Cleveland  if Valanciunas can play. Without him, the Raptors may get crushed.Pick: Cavaliers in 4BENJAMIN HOFFMAN"}

{"text": "Despite its reputation as the Hamptons blue-collar sibling, life in Montauk, N.Y., is more and more about the money, specifically, real estate. This has been true for several years, as housing prices in the hamlet on the East End of Long Island have gradually approached those in its more fashionable sister towns, and high-class spots  like Navy Beach and Ruschmeyers have started to move in.But now, in time for the start of the summer season, comes the tale of Tom Ferreira, a Montauk mechanic who is battling the Town of East Hampton, in which the village sits, over the mess he deposited for years in the yard of his home on Navy Road.For nearly a decade, Mr. Ferreira, 56, piled the plot with a changing disarray of parked cars, beached boats, dilapidated trailers, old spare tires, rusty propane tanks, broken plastic crates, inoperable motors and a 40-foot antenna, running what officials of the town once called an unauthorized recycling and scrap yard. In 2009, tired of the unsightly heaps of junk, the officials hired a carting company and hauled it all away.This week, after years of fighting the removal of his property in both state and local courts, Mr. Ferreira took the town to trial in higher venue: Federal District Court, in Central Islip. In a classic Hamptons legal story, he has accused the town officials of improperly employing emergency health and safety laws in a conspiracy to forcibly clean his yard. The purpose of the plan? To enhance the value of a neighboring piece of real estate, his court papers say.The trial, as it turns out, could not be timelier. On Monday, even as the jury was being picked, the Long Island newspaper Newsday reported that Gosmans Dock, an old-timey seafood place on Montauk Harbor, had just been put up for sale at the astronomical asking price of $52.5 million. And with Memorial Day approaching, top-of-the-market rentals in Mr. Ferreiras neighborhood near Fort Pond Bay were being listed for $2,000 a night.In the trials opening arguments, Larry Kelly, Mr. Ferreiras lawyer, admitted that his client was a messy guy with a messy yard, but argued that this conspicuous untidiness did not mean he was a danger to the public, as town officials have repeatedly asserted. What was really going on when the East Hampton Town Board hired flatbed trailers to clear the clutter from Mr. Ferreiras land was not about good governance, but about gentrifying property, Mr. Kelly said.In East Hampton Town, he told the jury, a key component of every residents thought process is: What is the value of my home? He went on to say: An auto mechanic in an old torpedo warehouse became an eyesore. There was intense pressure from the neighbors and that intense pressure was brought to other people, other people who helped take down this situation.Those other people, Mr. Kelly has contended, include a politically connected real-estate broker who stood to earn a sizable commission if she sold the house next door to Mr. Ferreiras, which was owned by his estranged and aging aunt. Court papers say the broker persuaded nearly 40 Montauk residents to complain about Mr. Ferreiras yard, even though when a fire marshal inspected it in May 2009, he discovered only a single violation: a fire extinguisher that was not up to code.The conspiracy was set in motion, Mr. Kelly said, when a second inspection was conducted, one that determined that Mr. Ferreira was in fact in violation of local maintenance laws. This inspection might have been doctored, Mr. Kelly argued, adding that the first one had been suppressed.Dismissing all of this as a distraction, Mark Radi, a lawyer for the Town of East Hampton, began his own address with a blunt assertion: This is a case about a junkyard. And not just any junkyard, Mr. Radi said, but one that for years had festered like a wound, filled with old cars whose toxic fluids might leach into the topsoil or, even worse, he said, suddenly combust and spread like wildfire into other peoples homes.Where Mr. Kelly said he saw a real estate conspiracy, Mr. Radi spoke of the necessity of municipal code enforcement. While he acknowledged that Mr. Ferreira had once owned a legitimate repair shop up the block, he said that he had lost it years ago  in a quintessential Montauk moment  when his landlord, the former teen heartthrob Ralph Macchio, raised the rent. By the time Mr. Ferreira had moved the shop to his yard on Navy Road, he was no longer fixing vehicles; instead, he was cocooning them, Mr. Radi said. Moreover, the yard, as he put it, had become a mole, something small and ugly that grew into a cancer, and had to be removed.Judge Joseph F. Bianco has the task of refereeing the dispute, which, in a strictly legal sense, concerns the question of whether town officials provided Mr. Ferreira with ample opportunity to contest the removal of his property or if the raid, as Mr. Kelly called it, amounted to an illegal search and seizure.Running with that theme, Mr. Kelly began his presentation to the jury with a reading of the Fourth Amendment. Somewhat later, he compared the flatbed trucks that arrived at Navy Road to the quartering of British troops in American colonists homes.Whatever the eventual result, the trial has provided Mr. Ferreira, whose family has lived on Navy Road since 1946, with the means by which to vent his spleen against officials in East Hampton. He not only lost his entire set of tools in the removal  his air compressor, his wet-dry vacuum, his 20-ton hydraulic press  but he also later got a bill for $20,000 to cover the cost of carting them away.Mr. Ferreira moved full time to the house on Navy Road in 1995, and was especially upset over what this case suggested about the future of this sleepy little beach town. Ive been going out to Montauk since I was a little kid, he said. And trust me, Ive seen a lot thats changed."}
{"text": "So now the Mets are coming home to play the Washington Nationals on Tuesday in the first meeting this season between the two best teams in the National League East.Except for the inconvenient fact that the Mets are in third place, trailing the first-place Nationals and the surprising Philadelphia Phillies, and feeling a little down after going 4-7 on a long trip out West.The Mets still have a 21-16 record this season, a game and a half behind the Nationals, and things might have been better had they managed to beat the Rockies in Denver on Sunday to avoid a weekend sweep. Instead, they lost, 4-3.With Jacob deGrom on the mound, the Mets took a 3-2 lead into the bottom of the seventh. But with one out and a runner on second, Manager Terry Collins pulled deGrom and brought in Jim Henderson, who promptly surrendered a two-run pinch-hit homer to Ryan Raburn that gave the Rockies the lead, and the game.A half-inning later, the Mets had a rally of sorts going  Juan Lagares on second and Yoenis Cespedes on first with one out  when Lucas Duda hit a roller to Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado.Arenado reached to tag Lagares as he ran toward third but clearly missed him, then threw to first to get Duda. The third-base umpire, Carlos Torres, did not signal that Lagares had run out of the baseline to dodge Arenados tag attempt, so it seemed he was safe at third, Cespedes was on second and there were two outs.However, the second-base umpire, Rob Drake, ruled that Lagares had indeed run out of the baseline and called him out. Double play, inning over and, shortly after, the game as well.Replays showed that Lagares appeared to have stayed in the baseline, but the call was not reviewable.It was that kind of weekend for the Mets. Drake was apparently wrong on Sunday, and on Saturday night, it was Torres, umpiring behind the plate, who hurt the Mets with a bad call. He ruled that the Rockies Tony Wolters had foul-tipped a two-strike pitch from the Mets Logan Verrett.Replays showed that Wolters had clearly swung and missed at a pitch in the dirt and should have been out. But a foul-tip ruling is not reviewable, either. Wolters, given another chance, hit a two-run, bases-loaded double that gave the Rockies a 5-1 lead.After that game, which the Mets lost, 7-4, Collins was steamed about the foul-tip call. On Sunday, after the ruling that went against Lagares, he was more subdued. Maybe he, and his team, were tapped out by the long trip.It was a trip that included a major highlight  the first home run of Bartolo Colons career, at the age of 42  and a powerful performance by pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in a game in which he also hit two home runs.But the trip also included disconcerting news: The left-hander Steven Matzs arm was sore, so was David Wrights shoulder, and Syndergaard had had his right elbow checked. Matz said on Saturday that he felt fine, but a medical exam awaits him in New York. Wrights soreness could explain the low-intensity, submarine-style throws he now often makes to first base.Wright is not hitting much, either, but he does have a strong on-base percentage (.373) because he is drawing walks (25). Matz has been pitching well, and so has Syndergaard. DeGrom is 3-1 this season with a 2.50 earned run average after Sundays game, but he has not looked anywhere near as overpowering as he did in 2015, perhaps because he, like Matt Harvey, is dealing with the effects of a heavy workload last season.On Sunday, deGrom gave up four hits and struck out three batters. There were also a bunch of hard-hit balls that were caught.In other words, deGrom was decent, but nothing special. As are the third-place Mets."}
{"text": "TORONTO  As the Toronto Raptors assembled their lead in the third quarter, Air Canada Centre began to fill with an unmistakable sense that this team was not merely overpowering the Miami Heat. No, the Raptors were also escaping their past. All the first-round exits. All the blown chances. All the disappointments.On Sunday afternoon, the Raptors turned the most significant basketball game in franchise history into a citywide celebration, defeating the Heat, 116-89, in Game 7 of the teams Eastern Conference semifinals. Kyle Lowry scored 35 points with a sore elbow, and DeMar DeRozan added 28 with a sprained thumb.I know one thing, Coach Dwane Casey said. Our guys compete.Nothing about this game was easy for the Raptors  not against the likes of Dwyane Wade, not after seven games, not with so many banged-up bodies. But for the first time in the teams 21-season existence, the Raptors are bound for the conference finals. Their series with the Cleveland Cavaliers will start Tuesday night at Quicken Loans Arena.We aint satisfied, Lowry said. Thats just our mentality.The Raptors erupted in the third quarter, building their lead possession by possession. To 11 when DeMarre Carroll sank a 3-pointer. To 14 when Bismack Biyombo got inside for a dunk. To 16 when Lowry drove to the rim for layup. The Heat trailed by as many as 28 in the fourth.They wore us down, Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. Toronto beat us, fair and square.Wade and Goran Dragic scored 16 points each for the Heat, who were greeted by light snowfall when they left their hotel for the game. About a half-hour before tipoff, flurries gave way to hail. It was springtime in Canada, and the conditions  at least symbolically  favored the Raptors. (For the record, it did not snow in Miami for Game 6.)Thousands of fans filed into Jurassic Park, an outdoor viewing party on a block next to the arena. If people here were excited about the game, about this national event, then they were also opening themselves up to the possibility of more frustration, more misery, more sadness.The ghosts of postseasons past have haunted this franchise. Seven previous trips to the playoffs. Six first-round flameouts. It has been particularly impossible for Toronto to forget 2001, when it came within seconds of advancing to the conference finals. But Vince Carter, after attending his college graduation ceremony that morning, missed a shot at the buzzer, and the Philadelphia 76ers escaped with a Game 7 win in the conference semifinals. That was 15 years ago. The Raptors finally seized another opportunity.This organization deserves it, DeRozan said.This was a physical series that featured nearly as many injuries as missed shots. Both teams had long ago lost their starting centers  the Raptors Jonas Valanciunas to a sprained right ankle, the Heats Hassan Whiteside to a sprained right knee.Others played on, through jammed thumbs and bruised wrists, through the toll of a seven-game series that manifested itself in bandages and braces.In Game 6, with his team hoping to extend the series, Spoelstra went small by starting Justise Winslow, a first-year forward, at center. Spoelstra sought to generate more offense, and he instructed Winslow to set screen after screen along the perimeter, drawing Biyombo, his primary defender, away from the basket. The Heat ran away with the win.Ahead of Game 7, Casey expressed cautious optimism that his players would make the necessary adjustments. He wanted his defenders to focus on the ball, to contain Wade and Dragic and at least slow their dribble penetration. Casey advised his players to stop worrying so much about the coming screen.Too many times, were looking to see where the screens are coming from, Casey said, adding, We have to do a good job of locking into the basketball.The arena practically shook when DeRozan scored the first points of the game on a midrange jumper. The crowd roared when Wade picked up his second foul and took an early seat.Neither team was particularly efficient, however, and this surprised no one after two weeks of turnovers and empty possessions. On Sunday, the Raptors and the Heat combined to miss nine of their first 10 3-point attempts. DeRozan, though, was assertive. He scored 11 points on 12 field-goal attempts in the first quarter. Toronto took a 53-47 lead into the second half.As the game wore on, others emerged for the Raptors. Biyombo finished with 17 points, and Patrick Patterson had 11 points and 11 rebounds.I thought tonight we played big, Casey said. If youre going to do that, youve got to make sure you plant your feet in the lane and do what you do.Late in the fourth quarter, with the final seconds melting away on the Heats season, a happy mob formed in front of the Raptors bench. Coaches embraced. Players exchanged high-fives.But back in the locker room, a dose of reality awaited: scouting reports on the Cavaliers, one for every player.Its another step for us, Casey said. But were not there yet."}
{"text": "Twenty-four hours after Adam Lindemann sold a Jean-Michel Basquiat at Christies for $57.3 million  an auction record for the artist  he found himself in the role of bidder as selling began for a 1942 Calder standing mobile at Sothebys last Wednesday night. He thought the $3 million to $4 million estimate was too low, that the piece was worth $10 million, given that it had once been owned by Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the Museum of Modern Art.Mr. Lindemann, 54, an established collector and dealer, jumped into the bidding himself, but dropped out before the piece ultimately sold for $8.3 million with fees.Had I pushed it, it would have gone to 10, he said later. It wasnt destined to come to me. Sometimes when you bid, youre not going to get it  you just know. It was an amazing purchase for someone to own and to keep for a decade. It was not necessarily the right purchase for someone like me.Mr. Lindemann, a regular in the New York auction rooms, agreed to share his impressions of the spring sales in real time with a reporter. As both a buyer and a seller, he was active last week, offering an up-close view of the negotiations that go into each sale.Why didnt he buy the Calder? He wouldnt divulge his final bid, but indicated that it wasnt a work he would want to sit on until it appreciated enough to resell. Given his legal and business expertise (he has a degree from Yale Law School and used to run his own investment firm), he has established himself as a knowledgeable insider, and buys for both love and value, tending to spend in the $20 million-and-under range. Before selling the Basquiat he bought an Uli figure from Papua New Guinea, the cover lot at Sothebys African, Oceanic and Pre-Columbian art sale, for $4.7 million.Hes part of the trade, said Brett Gorvy, Christies worldwide chairman of postwar and contemporary art. Hes been a collector and a dealmaker for most of his career, he knows all the ins and outs of what actually happens in an auction room. Hes used to selling and trading up. That gives him a different kind of mentality. You have to have a certain ability to detach yourself from objects.Mr. Lindemanns decision to sell the Basquiat was therefore carefully considered. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could have seemed like a risky time to sell one of the most valuable pieces in his collection. But Christies had a buyer who had committed to paying at least $40 million for the piece. And Mr. Lindemann said the moment was actually opportune, given the lack of competition from other major consignments.If it were a regular bullish sale in 2014, we would have been fighting a Rothko or a Picasso and a $50 million balloon dog, he said, referring to a Jeff Koons sculpture. The question is, do you want to be the lead in a smaller movie or do you want to be in a film with Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio?If you know that you can deliver, he said, you do the smaller movie, where youre the lead and the movie is about you.Mr. Lindemann had sold major works before; for example, Mr. Koonss bright red Hanging Heart (Magenta/Gold) at Sothebys in 2007 for $23.5 million. But the Basquiat  sold to the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa  was a prize that auction houses had been trying to wrest away from him since he bought the painting for $4.5 million in 2004.Almost every six months or every year, I would put forward an offer, Mr. Gorvy said. Each time it was someone who was looking for a masterpiece. He was willing to listen, but he always had a firm number in his head, and that number was 50.Mr. Lindemann, who comes from wealth  Forbes puts his familys net worth at $2.9 billion  has collected for about 20 years and showcases art through two galleries: Venus Over Manhattan, which opened in 2012, and Venus Over Los Angeles, which opened in 2015. Mr. Lindemanns exhibitions tend to be deliberately untraditional, like his current show of Warhols Little Electric Chairs.He is married to an art dealer, Amalia Dayan, and the two live in a Brutalist Upper East Side townhouse designed by the architect David Adjaye. Last year Mr. Lindemann bought Andy Warhols former oceanfront compound in Montauk.He started his galleries as a way to showcase artists who he believes have not received the attention they deserve, like William Copley, Bernard Buffet, Jack Goldstein and H. C. Westermann. Theres plenty of good galleries in New York and plenty that are better than mine, he said, adding that he aims to revisit artists who are out of favor, to look at historic work in a new way.Mr. Gorvy said: The fact that he likes Westermann kind of tells it all  a highly quirky, highly respected artist among a niche group of collectors  someone who is really anti-commercial in a certain way. Thats the kind of thing Adam pursues.During Sothebys contemporary auction last week, Mr. Lindemann  who has a round face and bright blue eyes  was a font of caustic commentary. Elaine Sturtevants Warhol Marilyn, he said, which went for $490,000 on an estimate of $300,000 to $400,000, was a cheap way to buy something you cant afford. (Sturtevant made close but inexact versions of other artists works.) And the bidding on an untitled Rudolf Stingel canvas from 2007  estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million  was insane in his opinion.But behind his desk in his Madison Avenue gallery the following day, Mr. Lindemann commended the sale. It was a solid 10, he said. Everyone in the room felt good.Sothebys had selected items that it knew it could sell, he said  artists who continue to make the same kind of things, like Christopher Wool, Robert Ryman, Rudolf Stingel and Agnes Martin.This market wants whats identifiable, Mr. Lindemann said. This market wants security, because this market is nervous.He also made a point of noting who the auction houses are not selling, suggesting that certain artists are currently out of favor. Why are there no Damien Hirsts in the evening sale anymore? Where are they? he said. Where are the Wade Guytons?In his view, estimates placed on works by auction houses are too often mistaken for actual value, when they are simply the result of deals between auction houses and sellers: The prices represent how much the auction house is willing to commit to a seller and what that seller is willing to accept.You have to appreciate the views of the consignor and the agenda of the auction house, Mr. Lindemann said. People think the estimate represents the value. And often it doesnt.He believes that putting more than 20 Calders up for sale this season among the three main auction houses was a mistake, glutting the market, even though Calders generally do well and brought solid prices this time around. And he said that while an auction can seem inappropriately decadent, given all these numbers being thrown around, if it were real estate, no one would have a problem with it.In a way, he added, many pictures today are worth as much or more than anybodys home."}
{"text": "LONDON   Before boarding the plane that took the Spanish league trophy back home to Barcelona, Gerard Piqu spoke in Granada, Spain, of the teams biggest opponent this season  itself.We had to win it twice, Piqu told reporters. When we were 8 or 10 points ahead, we believed we had it won. Then there was a moment when it seemed we lost it, although we always depended only on ourselves.Spains La Liga was the last of the big leagues to be decided this season. Bayern Munich, Juventus and Paris St.-Germain turned Germany, Italy and France into one-horse races (the same horses as last year), while Leicester City surprised everybody by winning, easily in the end, in England.Spain went the full distance, with all three front-runners  Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atltico Madrid  winning their final games on Saturday. The race finished in that order, with Bara, Real and Atltico separated by just three points.All the rumors of top teams offering incentives  not bribes to throw games, but incentives to players on other clubs to play hard against the other teams chasing the title  came to nothing.You could offer Granada the world, but it had neither the skills, the stamina nor the belief to do anything other than succumb, 3-0, in its own stadium against Barcelona.You could likewise offer any amount of encouragement to Deportivo La Corua, and its fight, too, would be feeble against Real Madrid. Their match was effectively over before halftime after Reals Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice and hit the woodwork twice before he was taken off to rest.The reality is that Barcelona and Real are superior clubs in their own league, while Atltico is the exception to the supposed rule that no other force can challenge them.Indeed, their powers extend to Europe, where Barcelona won the Champions League last year and where the two Madrid giants will lock horns in the final in Milan on May 28.Players always say that the Champions League is the glory, while the domestic leagues offer the greater test of their skills, consistency and staying power.Yet superstars dominate this league marathon. Ronaldos two goals on Saturday  one poached from a few yards, the other deflected into the net off a defenders back  gave him 35 goals in the 38-game league season and an unprecedented sixth consecutive season of notching 50 or more goals over all.Barcelona has a man who beat Ronaldo this particular season. And this time, it is not Lionel Messi.With three goals against Granada, Luis Surez took his tally to 14 goals over the last five games, 40 in La Liga for the season and 59 in all competitions.Barcelona has one more game to play, the Copa del Rey final against Sevilla on Sunday.Messi, Neymar and Surez combined for 90 of the 112 goals that Barcelona scored this season as it retained its league title. And while Messi has coped with injuries and changed his role toward being a midfield playmaker, Neymar also emphasized Saturday that he is perfectly content to feed the predator that Surez has hungrily become.Where it went wrong, or almost went wrong, for Barcelona was back in April, when that attacking trio flew halfway across the world to play energy-sapping World Cup qualifying games, Messi for Argentina, Neymar for Brazil and Surez for Uruguay.Real Madrid caught them while they were still jet-lagged. Losses to Real Sociedad in La Liga and to Atltico Madrid in the Champions League came thick and fast, and suddenly Barcelona looked weary and vulnerable, almost a spent force.Baras coach of few words, Luis Enrique, said then that his players had five games to save their season and that they thrived on such pressure. He repeated the same thought to the team over the weekend.Barcelonas response? Five games, five wins, 24 goals scored and none conceded. In Granada, the field was supposed to be the great leveler, but the home club did not muster a shot on goal until deep into the second half.The grass had been left long, deliberately, to prevent smooth running with the ball and the slick interchange of Barcelonas passing. That, and massed clusters of defenders, kept Barcelona scoreless for 22 minutes.Then came a movement involving eight players and 16 passes over the long grass, followed by one sharp finish by Surez. He possesses the art of timing, almost hiding himself until he smells the opportunity to pounce.He did so again before halftime, on the end of a much more economical buildup. Javier Mascherano advanced over the halfway line, lofting a long, high, angled pass, and Dani Alves, nominally a fullback, sped forward and hooked the ball toward the near post, where Surez exploited the space between the goalkeeper and the last defender.The long way, the short way, any way is good for Surez in this mood. He completed his third hat trick in five games off a pass from Neymar.Barcelona is the Spanish champion for the sixth time in eight years. Andrs Iniesta and Messi have been involved in eight La Liga titles to date.Their club was banned from making transfers over two seasons because it broke FIFAs youth recruitment rules. This left the club short of senior players, and the latest triumph has largely been achieved by fielding the same players in all competitions.Twenty years ago, concluded Piqu, we might not have won this title because Bara used to be sunk by its own pessimism. This generation has changed that  it faces up, you can trust in it.The public celebration was scheduled for Sunday in the Catalan capital."}
{"text": "President Obama took several sharp swipes at Donald J. Trump on Sunday during a commencement address that could be the beginning of a forceful effort to help elect a Democratic successor as president.Addressing Rutgers Universitys class of 2016 at the schools 250th anniversary commencement, Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Trump by name. But his target was clear, and his assessments earned raucous cheers from the graduates.The world is more interconnected than ever before, and its becoming more connected every day, Mr. Obama told the graduates. Building walls wont change that.Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has proposed building a wall between the United States and Mexico and forcing Mexico to pay for its potential multibillion dollar construction costs. Mr. Trump has also denounced much of the modern international trading and economic system, and he has proposed banning Muslim visitors and immigrants from the country, at least temporarily  all ideas Mr. Obama condemned on Sunday.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have exchanged zingers before. Mr. Trump was a leading voice questioning Mr. Obamas birth location and citizenship, and Mr. Obama has responded by taking particular delight in skewering Mr. Trump.But Mr. Obama is altering his stump speech in important ways to go after Mr. Trump. As his remaining time in office draws to less than a school year, Mr. Obama has alternated between mild and mock horror, pointed humor and a touch of disbelief in his attacks on the Republican front-runner.We live in an age of global supply chains, and a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed, Mr. Obama said. But the answer isnt to stop trading with other countries. In this global economy, thats not even possible.Mr. Obama said that isolating and disparaging Muslims was not only a betrayal of American values but would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in combating violent extremism.Wearing a crimson robe with black sashes and a purple doctoral hood that a fierce wind kept blowing off his shoulders, Mr. Obama told the graduates that the knowledge they had earned through years of studying was something they should insist political leaders value and possess themselves.Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science  these are good things. These are qualities you want in people making policy, Mr. Obama said, adding later, In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.Mr. Obama seemed to especially take pleasure in advocating the use of facts in politics while speaking to an academic audience. His point with such arguments is usually to press for action against climate change, one of the signature policies of his administration and one that nearly all climate scientists support.But while Mr. Obama mentioned climate change, he also used his points about facts and experience to take yet another swipe at an unnamed Mr. Trump.He noted that when people get sick, they want an experienced doctor to treat them; when they fly, they want experienced pilots.And yet in our public lives, we suddenly say, I dont want somebody whos done it before? he asked in derision.Mr. Trump has no experience as a politician, a quality that has been viewed as one of the most important reasons for his success as a presidential candidate.Mr. Obama came to Rutgers after students, faculty members and even relatives of students spent the past three years lobbying the White House for him to speak on this anniversary for the school.The truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. You are the first to launch a three-year campaign, he said. Emails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president, Mr. Obama said, drawing laughter. And I have to say that really sealed the deal. That was smart because I have a soft spot for grandmas.But Mr. Obama made clear that Rutgers was precisely the kind of institution that he wanted to celebrate. Last week, Mr. Obama spoke at the commencement of Howard University, a historically black university, and told the next generation of black leaders that passion must be tempered by strategic thinking and a willingness to compromise.Rutgers, one of the first nine government-chartered institutions in the American colonies, could be the most diverse student body in America, he said. And he likened Rutgers long history of success with that of the country as a whole.And while he celebrated that history, he made clear to the graduates that no period in history was as prosperous as this one.The good old days werent all that good, Mr. Obama said. In fact, by almost every measure, America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago or 30 years ago or even eight years ago.One of Mr. Obamas frustrations during his presidency has been the countrys persistently sour mood despite what he sees as a remarkable turnaround in the nations economy, the passage of wide-ranging health care legislation and the nations pre-eminent strength militarily.He cited those accomplishments and many others, including declining rates of crime, teenage pregnancy and poverty, as well as improvements in life expectancy, the status of blacks and Latinos and clean energy.Marriage equality is the law of the land, he added, to robust cheers.As he often does in such speeches, Mr. Obama told the graduates that they needed to participate in the political process and be satisfied with incremental change. Democrats generally fare better than Republicans in high-turnout elections, and while young people overwhelmingly support Democrats, they rarely vote. So Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama, the first lady, always urge student audiences to show up at the polls on Election Day.Because apathy has consequences, the president said.He said changes, even small ones, were worth fighting for.I always tell my daughters, Better is good, Mr. Obama said near the end of his speech, adding, Dont waste your time waiting."}
{"text": "MIAMI  The day Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen told his prominent parents about his new gender identity, he did so in a letter that he left on their bed. Then he grabbed a packed bag and, unsure of whether he would be welcomed back, went to a friends house to see if his family would love him or leave him.His shocked parents, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican, and Dexter Lehtinen, who served as the top federal prosecutor here, did not hesitate. They grabbed the phone and told him that they loved him and that family trumped all, and asked him to come home. But as with many parents of transgender children, they were also overwhelmed by fear: The future they saw for their then 21-year-old, whom they had named Amanda, would be pockmarked with discrimination and bullying, if not outright violence.It was this visceral reaction to want to protect her child that drove Ms. Ros-Lehtinen to break from her partys skepticism or hostility on gay and transgender issues  a stance evident now in North Carolinas battle over transgender bathroom visits  and become a conspicuous advocate in Congress and more recently in public service announcements. On Monday, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, her husband and her son, now 30, will appear in the latest one for SAVE, a longtime South Florida gay rights group that hopes to engage the Latino community here.I worried about his safety and about his well-being, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said, noting that inflammatory debates like the one about school bathrooms serve to further alienate transgender youths and subject them to more bullying and animosity. I didnt want him to be depressed. You think of all the parade of horribles that could happen.There is ample evidence that many transgender people continue to be rejected by their families, employers and society, a situation that is beginning to change as the transgender movement becomes more visible and better organized. And while Ms. Ros-Lehtinen profoundly disagrees with President Obama on a number of issues, especially on his approach to Cuba, she agreed with his administrations directive Friday telling school districts to allow students to use the school facilities that match the sex they identify with, even if that conflicts with their anatomical sex.Allowing students to use the bathroom of their authentic selves is a step forward in stopping the stigma around transgender individuals, said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 63, the first Hispanic woman elected to Congress. Unnecessary laws only make transgender youth feel unaccepted, and can lead to depression or even worse, suicide.Her husband, a lawyer who as a United States attorney here supervised the prosecution of the Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and now teaches constitutional law at the University of Miami, said the administration had sent a strong message. But he questioned the method, worrying that the presidents unilateral approach might undercut the protections he is offering.Its important that in this slow but necessary recognition of equality that we do it on a sound legal basis, because law and process carry great weight with the American people, Mr. Lehtinen said. It legitimizes what we are trying to do.As for the Republican Party, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who has served in the House for more than 25 years, said it would come along as more Americans shared stories of how discrimination can harm the lives of gay and transgender people.The Republican Partys stance on the issue is lagging behind, she added. But folks are figuring out that there is no political harm in embracing these issues and, in fact, they see a lot of good can come out of it.For her family, the journey that began with Rodrigos letter in 2007 unfolded over five years. Rejecting their child, who had just graduated from Brown University, was unthinkable. Even so, getting entirely comfortable with the idea of a daughter who had become a son, a sister who had become a brother, was not altogether easy for the family and required adjustments, particularly outside the home.It was an evolving conversation for the next five years, said Mr. Heng-Lehtinen, who will soon move back to Miami from Los Angeles, where he works as a fund-raiser for a gay, lesbian and transgender rights group. Nobody expects their child to be transgender. Its a big shift, and we often want to go back to our normal lives.Although he had come out as bisexual as Amanda in high school, he said he knew so little about transgender people that he did not see it in himself until he got to Brown. He trod slowly, first by wearing mens clothing and asking friends to call him Rodrigo.I didnt know how comfortable a person could feel until I had tried on mens clothes, said Mr. Heng-Lehtinen, who goes by Rigo, adding that he had long grown accustomed to feeling depressed or anxious. A fog lifted.When the moment came to tell his family, he had no reason to think they would lash out, but he still imagined the worst. I am about to lose everyone I love, he told himself.He also feared that he would hurt his mothers political career, a possibility that did not worry Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.A turning point came when he told his 86-year-old abuelo in 2010. We were terrified to tell him, Mr. Heng-Lehtinen said. Instead of becoming angry, his grandfather shrugged. At his age, he said, nothing was more important than the happiness of his grandchild.It was an incredibly simple and loving response, Mr. Heng-Lehtinen added.As time went on, he began taking testosterone, and now sports a beard. Last year, he married a man, adding Heng to his name.His father, who was badly wounded in the face in Vietnam as an Army Ranger (and still bears the scar), says one way to generate empathy is to help people understand that sexual and gender orientation do not define a persons character  but that their work ethic, their honesty, their grit do.I dont mean its not important to the individual; its that it should not be important to us which choice they make, Mr. Lehtinen said. They are the same person. Its sometimes difficult for me to understand why anybody would think that their fundamental character would change because of their sexual orientation.Their son, Mr. Lehtinen added, has never been happier. As for the family, the new normal is exactly that  normal.This is exactly the message the Lehtinens hope to convey to Latinos as they sit around their kitchen table drinking coffee in the SAVE public service announcement, which will air on Spanish-language networks. Many Latinos are perceived as more traditional and more reluctant to embrace sexual diversity. Gay, lesbian and transgender issues were mostly taboo until recently, which meant that there was scarce media attention on the issue.Polling by the local management consultant Bendixen & Amandi, which has surveyed people on these issues for years and was commissioned by SAVE, showed that the way to connect with Latinos was to present a parent talking about the importance of family. This was an easy fit for the Lehtinens, who embraced that message from the start and whose prominence here gave it extra weight.Every transgender person is a part of someones family and should be treated with compassion and protected from discrimination, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said in the video."}
{"text": "Odds are that Donald J. Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan will eventually patch together a rapprochement.Their well-established substantive differences on trade, immigration and entitlements should not be a barrier. There is plenty of room to fudge a unified Republican agenda, especially with Mr. Trump, whose positions and even principles often seem to evolve as he deems politically necessary.But it is harder to see how their basic approaches to politics can coexist comfortably. Mr. Ryan is the leading practitioner of an optimistic conservatism that reaches out and is inclusive. Mr. Trump has emerged as the presumptive Republican nominee by skillfully appealing to an angry and alienated conservative base that is driven in part by racial and ethnic fears.The Trump-Ryan schism can be best understood by looking at two proxies: former Representative Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice-presidential nominee who was Mr. Ryans mentor and political role model, and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is being considered as Mr. Trumps running mate.Mr. Gingrich recently claimed that Mr. Trump is a little bit like Jack Kemp, but so much bigger a figure. There may be an argument about the latter part, but almost no one who was close to Mr. Kemp believes that the real estate tycoon is anything like him.This schism has little to do with ideology. Mr. Kemp, who died in 2009, was no liberal; he never met a tax he didnt want to cut or eliminate and, until his later years, was a foreign policy hawk. But he had a much more inclusive view of conservatism than many of his colleagues.The contrasts between the views of Mr. Kemp and Mr. Gingrich on touchstone issues over the years illustrate why Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan will never be soul mates.In 1994, Mr. Kemp campaigned against Proposition 187, a Republican-led California initiative that barred undocumented immigrants from using public services, including education. Mr. Gingrich said he probably would have voted for it. The measure passed, but it alienated the states fast-growing Latino population, and Democrats have dominated California politics ever since.Mr. Kemp, a former professional football player, was close with some black teammates, marched in civil rights protests and forged friendly alliances with a number of members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Gingrich had stormy relations with most members of that caucus, including his fellow Georgia lawmaker John Lewis.The contrast is equally striking when it comes to attitudes toward Muslims. After Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Kemp said he supported a war against terrorism but stressed that it was not a war against Muslims.Mr. Gingrich, like Mr. Trump, sees danger in Islam. He fiercely opposed a proposal to build a multicultural center and mosque in downtown Manhattan near the World Trade Center. There should be no mosque near ground zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia, he said.The former speaker once tried to persuade Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey not to appoint a Muslim judge, warning against the dangers of Shariah. Mr. Christie appointed the judge in 2011 anyway, saying the concern over Islamic law was bogus.There even is a pronounced Kemp-Gingrich split that mirrors the differences between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump over Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of most Republicans these days. Mr. Kemp worked for Mr. Reagan when he was governor of California, helped convert him to supply-side economics and was close to him during his presidency.When Mr. Gingrich ran for president in 2012, he frequently claimed an association with Mr. Reagan, even though they had little contact with each other and the lawmaker often criticized the president.Mr. Ryan is not a carbon copy of his mentor. Mr. Kemp, who never worried much about budget deficits, might have recoiled at some of the spending cuts to social services that the Wisconsin lawmaker has proposed. And as speaker, Mr. Ryan was slow to follow Mr. Kemps model in reaching out to the poor.But Mr. Ryan does practice the politics of opportunity and inclusion. By contrast, Mr. Trump, and often Mr. Gingrich, rely on anger, fear and racial and ethnic tensions. It has served them well.This split is one that cannot easily be negotiated."}
{"text": "And lo, it came to pass that the one they called Barbra would go on a summer tour and then release a new album. And the tour would include two nights in Brooklyn. And her many fans rejoiced.Of course they will, right?On Monday, Barbra Streisands longtime manager, Marty Erlichman, announced that Ms. Streisands latest North American tour would begin on Aug. 2, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, and continue through Aug. 23, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.The tour will also go to Las Vegas, Chicago, Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and San Jose, Calif., and on Aug. 11 and 13 it will come to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where Ms. Streisand, 74, was one of the arenas opening attractions in October 2012.Tickets will go on sale on May 25, although tickets will be available to American Express customers early, starting Wednesday.According to the announcement, online ticket buyers will receive a copy of Ms. Streisands latest album, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, a duets record to be released later this year. Neither the exact release date nor the names of any of the partners was announced.Ms. Streisands last album, Partners, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard chart in 2014, giving her the distinction of being the only act to reach No. 1 on the chart in each of the last six decades, starting in 1964, when People, her fourth album, made it to the top."}
{"text": "It has been somewhat fascinating and sometimes fun to watch Elizabeth Warren do battle with Donald Trump in alternating salvos of tweets, but in the end I fear that this approach of trying to beat a bully, as Warren put it in one of her tweets, is a futile effort.There is no way to sufficiently sully a pig or mock a clown. The effort only draws one further onto the opponents turf and away from ones own principles and priorities.There is no way to shame a man who lacks conscience or to embarrass an embarrassment. Trump is smart enough to know what he lacks  substance  and to know what he possesses in abundance  insolence.So long as he steers clear of his own weakness and draws others in to the brier patch that is his comfort, he wins.As MSNBCs Chris Matthews said in December, this is asymmetric warfare. Conventional forms of political fighting wont work on this man. Truth holds little power, and the media is still enthralled by the monster it made.He is hollow, inconsistent, dishonest and shifty and those who support him either love him in spite of it, or even more disturbingly, because of it.He has waffled or equivocated or backtracked on tax plans, releasing his tax returns, his proposed Muslim ban, abortion and any number of issues.It is hard to know where the hard bottom is beneath this morass of lies and bile. He has changed the very definition of acceptability as well as the expectations of the honor of ones words. He has exalted the art of deceit to a new political normalcy.This has made him nearly impervious to even the cleverest takedowns, and trust me, many have tried, comparing him to everyone from P. T. Barnum to Hitler.But none of these comparisons are likely to shift public opinion. Some people will continue to see him, rightly, as an imminent danger to this nation and the world, and others will continue to see him as a salvation from it.You see, part of the problem here is that some people believe, improbably, that virtue can be cloaked in vice, that what he says and what he means are fundamentally different, that the former is acting as a Trojan horse for the latter. One of Trumps greatest pros is that he has convinced his supporters, all evidence to the contrary, that they are not being conned.We are a society in search of an instant fix to some of Americas most intractable problems. Politicians of all stripes keep lying to us and saying things are going to be O.K.; that broad prosperity is just around the corner, only requiring minor tweaks; that for some of our issues there are clear good and bad options, rather than a choice between bad and worse options.Into this mess of stubborn realities steps a simpleton with a simple message: Make America great again. Well win so much that you will get tired of winning.Some folks want to be told that we could feasibly and logistically deport millions of people and ban more than a billion, build more walls and drop more bombs, have ever-falling tax rates and ever-surging prosperity. They want to be told that the only thing standing between where we are and where we are told we could be is a facility at crafting deals and a penchant for cracking down.This streamlined message appeals to that bit of the population that is frustrated by the problems we face and quickly tires of higher-level cerebral function. For this group of folks, Trump neednt be detailed, just different. He doesnt need established principles, as long as he attacks the establishment.This part of America isnt being artfully deceived, it is being willfully blind.On the one hand, over Trumps life and over this campaign he has been so wrong in so many ways that there is a danger that the sheer volume of revelations may render the hearers numb to them.On the other, as Joe Keohane wrote in the Boston Globe in 2010:Recently, a few political scientists have begun to discover a human tendency deeply discouraging to anyone with faith in the power of information. Its this: Facts dont necessarily have the power to change our minds. In fact, quite the opposite. In a series of studies in 2005 and 2006, researchers at the University of Michigan found that when misinformed people, particularly political partisans, were exposed to corrected facts in news stories, they rarely changed their minds. In fact, they often became even more strongly set in their beliefs. Facts, they found, were not curing misinformation. Like an underpowered antibiotic, facts could actually make misinformation even stronger.Supporting Trump is a Hail Mary pass of a hail-the-demagogue assemblage. Trumps triumph as the presumptive Republican Party nominee is not necessarily a sign of his strategic genius as much as its a sign of some peoples mental, psychological and spiritual deficiencies.Its hard to use the truth as an instrument of enlightenment on people who prefer to luxuriate in a lie."}
{"text": "Jamala, a Ukrainian singer who performed the politically charged ballad 1944, has won the 61st annual Eurovision Song Contest.After a deliberation process that lasted several months and included contests and appointments in each of the 42 participating countries and two semifinals last week, Jamala, whose full name is Susana Jamaladinova, was chosen by a combination of popular and jury voting in the final event at a Stockholm arena on Saturday night.Actually, I really want peace and love to everyone, Jamala said as she took the stage after winning the award. With tears in her eyes, she then performed the song again.The singer is an ethnic Tatar, and the song seems to make reference to Soviet abuses of the group in Crimea during World War II. (They kill you all and say, Were not guilty, she sings in the song.) There had been questions about the songs disqualification because of a ban on explicitly political songs, but it remained in competition because it does not directly name specific historical events.This years contest included some of the campy mainstays of Eurovisions past, as well as some shake-ups. Australia, a special guest in 2015, was invited back to compete in 2016. It led in the first half of the voting, which was decided by professional juries from each competing country. But it did not receive enough popular votes to win the contest.Russias entry, Sergey Lazarev, who sang You Are the Only One, had been expected by many observers to win. Mr. Lazarev received the highest score from viewers, but he did not receive enough total votes to surpass Jamala.As in past years, the contest was marred  or enhanced  by controversies, some of which echoed broader geopolitical debates. Romania was kicked out for failing to pay debts to the European Broadcasting Union, the conglomerate that organizes Eurovision. Spains entry drew strong criticism for performing a song sung entirely in English, a move that bothered many traditionalists in that country. Germany expelled its original entrant, Xavier Naidoo, after an outcry over his apparent sympathies for a fringe right-wing political movement.Victory in Eurovision has rarely translated to mainstream success, with the notable exceptions of Abba (the 1974 winner) and Celine Dion (in 1988). Conchita Wurst, an Austrian drag queen, earned cult status worldwide after winning in 2014. (The 2015 winner was Mans Zelmerlow of Sweden, for the song Heroes.)The voting system was overhauled this year in an effort to add suspense to the finale. In years past, entrants slowly racked up points in an announcement process that could take the better part of an hour. This year, the winner was not known until the contests final moments.Other front-runners in the 2016 contest included Amir, of France, with his song Jai Cherch, and Ira Losco, of Malta, with Walk on Water.The event was broadcast live in the United States for the first time this year, on the Logo network. Last years final event attracted around 200 million television viewers worldwide."}
{"text": "While many young British designers are known to focus on the avant-garde, the London-based Alice Archer, 31, is building a modern womens wear business around a very traditional art: embroidery. But her intricate threadwork  which she applies to every dress, skirt and coat she designs  is more high-tech than her customers might imagine.Archers studio, which is underneath a West London boutique called The Place London, is strewn with color charts, art books and reels of thread; there, she shows T how she maps out each individual stitch with a computer program. She then feeds that design into a digital embroidery machine, which sews the image onto fabric, whirring away with up to 12 threads while she observes with a watchful eye. Each design can take a week of painstaking programming, and yet old-fashioned methods would be even slower; without this software, she says, one person could not deliver a heavily embroidered, 20-piece fashion collection each season.For fall/winter 2016, Archers designs include a blood-red velvet suit, a black leather dress and a series of pencil skirts  all embellished with roses, daisies and chrysanthemums. In her work, she says, I want to see really beautiful colors. I want the embroideries to be quite sculptural, and the shapes of the garments to be really flattering. In the past, she has also combined threadwork with prints: for one dress, she transferred a detail of a womans cheek, taken from the 19th-century painting The Surprise by Claude-Marie Dubufe, onto white, floral embroidery.Archer could have applied her craft to interiors or art, yet fashion, she says, is what I desire. I want to wear these clothes. She has designed only three collections so far  but she put in a decade of training and practice first. She took an art foundation course at Central Saint Martins, earned a BA in fine art and textiles at Goldsmiths, and an MA in textile design at the Royal College of Art. Between studies, she spent three years running the London Embroidery Studio, and spent one season as a design assistant at Dries Van Noten. She has also often worked on the artist Tracey Emins embroidered artworks. (She draws on a piece of calico, and then we sit on a beanbag all day, hand-embroidering it, Archer explains. Its a really nice job.)She designed her first fashion collection in 2014, after the former Browns CEO Simon Burstein spotted a design that she had done for the shoemaker Caroline Groves, and invited her to create an 8-piece capsule line for Browns. From their first encounter, her work struck him as innovative: I thought there was something really very modern about it, and I felt that I could guide her, he recalls. When he sold Browns in 2015, he opened The Place London in Connaught Village and set her up with a studio. (Both Browns and The Place London stock her brand, and Barneys in New York and Los Angeles will pick it up this fall.)Archer is still relatively new to the process of designing the garments underneath the embroidery, but she finds it more and more enjoyable. She uses the pattern cutter Linda Woolcot, who has worked with Margaret Howell and Victoria Beckham: Shes really experienced, says Archer of Woolcot, and really gets the romantic side of what I want to do with the shapes. The brand is inspired by the likes of Keira Knightley, Lily James and Daisy Ridley  the English rose with a twist  and to this end, Archers designs are luxurious and feminine, but she tempers the ladylike quality by including casual, everyday silhouettes. An embroidered, red-checked shirt is one of her best-selling items. On the day T visits, she is wearing a flowery denim dress: You can machine wash it, and the embroiderys quite robust, actually, she says. You dont have to feel precious in it. I quite like that."}
{"text": "Years ago, I took care of a little girl whose mother worried tremendously about her clumsiness. When she was 4 or 5, my patient was still tripping and falling more than other children her age, her mother thought. She had trouble with the clapping games in her preschool. The mother was visibly distressed when she talked about this. She told me that she herself had been that kid, the clumsy one, the last one chosen for every team.For a long time, a variety of terms were used in medicine and education to describe children who struggled with coordination but had no underlying condition, terms like the ominous-sounding minimal brain dysfunction, the milder movement-skill problems, and yes, clumsy child syndrome. In 1994, these were consolidated under a single diagnosis, developmental coordination disorder, though this covers a wide range of children who may struggle with anything from handwriting to riding a bicycle.There is always a risk when you apply a diagnosis, always a chance that it will be seen as pathologizing or stigmatizing children. Are kids better off thinking of themselves as just kind of awkward? Should parents shrug and say, no one in our family is a good dancer?I think there is a perception out there that children who are clumsy are just children who arent good at sports, said Dr. John Cairney, a professor of family medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, which maintains a website about the disorder with useful advice for parents. Its more important, he said, to think about how it affects children and adults in everyday activities  tying shoelaces, using knives and forks.The need for a diagnosis depends on whether the child is actually struggling. Pediatricians and pediatric neurologists do sometimes encounter parents who worry because a child isnt gifted at sports, or at a particular sport. Not being gifted, or even good, at sports is not a diagnosis, and its probably more important for that childs well-being to help parents take a new look and find the childs real strengths and inclinations.Some of these kids come in referred to me, and they really look pretty normal; a lot is parental anxiety, said Dr. Stephen Nelson, a pediatric neurologist and an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University, who wrote the Medscape article on developmental coordination disorder. Its O.K. if he doesnt throw the ball well; he can have other skills, Dr. Nelson said. We dont all have to excel at everything.On the other hand, a child whose fine-motor skills are far behind what is age appropriate may struggle to put on clothing, or feel bad about activities that children do for fun, like playing with Legos. And there are children whose problems go beyond just being average (or a little worse) at basic athletic skills, and those children can find themselves dreading gym class, and in some cases even being bullied.You have parents and teachers attempting to push them into activities, believing the problem is motivational, not neurologic or motoric, Dr. Cairney told me. They get bullied, called stupid or klutzy. With a diagnosis, he said, the childrens quality of life might improve, especially if they are given good advice about how to manage the problem.Taking the clumsy child for evaluation is all about whether the child could use some help. That may involve modifying the childs environment: Lots of children are referred for evaluation because of dysgraphia, or terrible handwriting. Learning how to use a keyboard can make a huge difference for their school functioning.Occupational therapy is a mainstay for these children. They have to practice the specific skills they want to improve, whether that means handwriting, tying shoelaces or using a knife and fork.An evaluation may help tease out problems that arent actually coordination issues. Some children look clumsy because theyre distracted, not paying attention to the motor  or athletic  task at hand. Others may have visual impairments. Doctors worry more if a child is delayed in several realms at once; if speech, fine-motor and gross-motor are all lagging. Most concerning of all is when a child who wasnt originally clumsy starts to lose coordination skills, or begins to walk differently. Such a child should definitely be evaluated, because something new and medically serious could be going on.So what about my patient? Well, she illustrates another point: Developmental coordination disorder is found more often among children with other issues, like attention problems, learning issues and autism. Parents with a child who is not doing well in school and also seems uncoordinated should take the lack of coordination as a reinforcing reason to have developmental and academic testing done.That was true with my patient; her mother was very focused on her daughters clumsiness, but her preschool teachers were worried that something was getting in her way in the classroom. She ended up needing some special help with reading and schoolwork as she entered school. I would probably take her mothers concern about clumsiness more seriously sooner these days, looking at it as a clue to that larger issue.Clumsier children may become more self-conscious about displaying their motor skills and less likely to participate in games and activities, and this may mean they get less practice. And practice does help everyone, from the naturally gifted to the rest of us.In general, most of this gets better with time, Dr. Nelson said. However, he added, its not something that children completely outgrow; clumsy children, on the whole, tend to become clumsy adults.With more screen time and less freedom to play outside unsupervised, theres also a concern that many children may have a lower chance of developing and practicing many motor skills (other than swiping and clicking). We need to do more to support childrens global motor development, Dr. Cairney said, not to ensure they become athletes, but to ensure they can participate in a range of activities.Related:Interested in more Well Family?

{"text": "To the Editor:As an Egyptian-American, I applaud the beautifully audacious article by Mona Eltahawy, Sex Talk for Muslim Women (Sunday Review, May 8). By the end of this year, I will have lived in the United States more years than I lived in my home country, which I left at 21.In coming of age in America as a young adult, I unlearned and learned a great deal about men, appropriate and inappropriate conduct, and how to honor and cherish my own sexuality. I learned that there is no shame in our human instincts of desire or sexual orientation. I continue to learn that the honor and moral character of men and women lie elsewhere.Ms. Eltahawys article is a reminder of the people and societies that have made healthy sexuality hostage to financial means to marry, the dogma of religion, and the power of archaic social mores. Her courage to speak up about it and for women like me is a breath of fresh air.RANIA SANFORDSan Jose, Calif."}

{"text": "U.S. politicians love to pose as defenders of family values. Unfortunately, this pose is often, perhaps usually, one of remarkable hypocrisy.And no, Im not talking about the contrast between public posturing and personal behavior, although this contrast can be extreme. Which is more amazing: the fact that a long-serving Republican speaker of the House sexually abused teenage boys, or how little attention this revelation has received?Instead, Im talking about policy. Judged by what we actually do  or, more accurately, dont do  to help small children and their parents, America is unique among advanced countries in its utter indifference to the lives of its youngest citizens.For example, almost all advanced countries provide paid leave from work for new parents. We dont. Our public expenditure on child care and early education, as a share of income, is near the bottom in international rankings (although if it makes you feel better, we do slightly edge out Estonia.)In other words, if you judge us by what we do, not what we say, we place very little value on the lives of our children, unless they happen to come from affluent families. Did I mention that parents in the top fifth of U.S. households spend seven times as much on their children as parents in the bottom fifth?But can our neglect of children be ended?In January, both Democratic candidates declared their support for a program that would provide 12 weeks of paid leave to care for newborns and other family members. And last week, while the news media was focused on Donald Trumps imaginary friend, I mean imaginary spokesman, Hillary Clinton announced an ambitious plan to improve both the affordability and quality of U.S. child care.This was an important announcement, even if it was drowned out by the ugliness and nonsense of a campaign that is even uglier and more nonsensical than usual. For child-care reform is the kind of medium-size, incremental, potentially politically doable  but nonetheless extremely important  initiative that could well be the centerpiece of a Clinton administration. So whats the plan?O.K., we dont have all the details yet, but the outline seems pretty clear. On the affordability front, Mrs. Clinton would use subsidies and tax credits to limit family spending on child care  which can be more than a third of income  to a maximum of 10 percent. Meanwhile, there would be aid to states and communities that raise child-care workers pay, and a variety of other measures to help young children and their parents. All of this would still leave America less generous than many other countries, but it would be a big step toward international norms.Is this doable? Yes. Is it desirable? Very much so.When we talk about doing more for children, its important to realize that it costs money, but not all that much money. Why? Because there arent that many young children at any given time, and it doesnt take a lot of spending to make a huge difference to their lives. Our threadbare system of public support for child care and early education costs 0.4 percent of the G.D.P.; Frances famously generous system costs 1.2 percent of the G.D.P. So we could move a long way up the scale with a fairly modest investment.And it would indeed be an investment  every bit as much of an investment as spending money to repair and improve our transportation infrastructure. After all, todays children are tomorrows workers and taxpayers. So its an incredible waste, not just for families but for the nation as a whole, that so many childrens futures are stunted because their parents dont have the resources to take care of them as well as they should. And affordable child care would also have the immediate benefit of making it easier for parents to work productively.Are there any reasons not to spend a bit more on children? The usual suspects will, of course, go on about the evils of big government, the sacred nature of individual choice, the wonders of free markets, and so on. But the market for child care, like the market for health care, works very badly in practice.And when someone starts talking about choice, bear in mind that were talking about children, who are not in a position to choose whether theyre born into affluent households with plenty of resources or less wealthy families desperately trying to juggle work and child care.So can we stop talking, just for a moment, about who won the news cycle or came up with the most effective insult, and talk about policy substance here?The state of child care in America is cruel and shameful  and even more shameful because we could make things much better without radical change or huge spending. And one candidate has a reasonable, feasible plan to do something about this shame, while the other couldnt care less."}

{"text": "Not long after word emerged that a former New York City police officer would not serve time in prison for the fatal shooting of Akai Gurley, a protest erupted on the street outside the home of Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney.Showing up at 1 a.m., the demonstrators banged on drums and waved a banner  #ByeKen: Blood on Your Hands  then began haranguing Mr. Thompsons neighbors. We want you to know you live next door to someone complicit in a murder! they shouted. In the murder of black people here in New York City!By any standard, the action was unusual  and unusually personal  not least because Mr. Thompson, who is black, campaigned on the promise of restoring justice to Brooklyns black communities and took several steps toward fulfilling that goal. In his first two years in office, he has ended prosecutions for most low-level marijuana offenses, established a program to help offenders clear open warrants from their records, strengthened a unit that examines wrongful convictions, created a young adult court and pursued the police for line-of-duty misconduct in at least four cases where the victims were minorities.Yet as his tenure has progressed, Mr. Thompsons most determined opponents have not been conservative law-and-order types. Instead, they have come from a constituency one might have assumed would be his ally: advocates for criminal-justice reform.Theres an overwhelming disenchantment with him in this community, said Keegan Stephan, a veteran activist who has taken part in the protests against Mr. Thompson. It would be wrong to suggest he hasnt done good things, but many people who supported him at first are criticizing him now.At the heart of this community is a small and diverse array of grass-roots groups whose members have staged protests across the city and have undertaken a scathing social-media campaign against Mr. Thompson, a Democrat, and his office. That campaign, laced with caustic Twitter posts and videos on Facebook, has been inspired in part by Mr. Gurleys family, which has bitterly attacked the district attorney, and has found support among several officials, like State Assemblyman Charles Barron, a firebrand Democrat from Brooklyn.In recent weeks, the demonstrators have started to compare Mr. Thompson to Anita Alvarez, the states attorney in Cook County, Ill., who lost her job over the case of Laquan MacDonald in Chicago, and Tim McGinty, the Cleveland prosecutor who was voted out of office for his handling of the death of Tamir Rice. Branding Mr. Thompson a sellout and a traitor, they have begun to issue demands that he resign.There would seem to be an irony in liberal protesters openly condemning a liberal district attorney. But those who have found fault with Mr. Thompson  including public defenders who have joined the activists in the substance, if not style, of their complaints  have claimed that he applied standards of justice for the former officer, Peter Liang, in Mr. Gurleys death that were different from those used in the cases of ordinary people, many of whom were black or Hispanic and charged with minor crimes.Thompson sought to afford access to meaningful justice for Mr. Liang, two officials of the Legal Aid Society wrote in an opinion article shortly after the district attorney recommended probation for Mr. Liang. Sadly, our clients are not given the same consideration.Mr. Thompson is hardly the first public figure in the city to have faced the challenge of enacting liberal policies in a job that often demands a dose of compromise and pragmatism. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, has also managed to put in place several planks of his liberal agenda while taking criticism from the left on issues like policing and housing. Some of his ostensible allies have gone so far as to hint that they will run against him in the next mayoral election, in 2017.Mr. Thompson, whose supporters have said he is interested in running for higher office, declined to publicly discuss his critics. But after the rally at his home last month, his aides released a statement in his name that read, These efforts to harass and intimidate my family, frighten my young children and disturb my neighbors at 1 in the morning will not deter me from doing what is right.For any district attorney  let alone the first black one in Brooklyns history  the Gurley case would have been a test.In November 2014, Mr. Liang, a probationary officer, was on patrol in a dark stairwell of a public-housing project when he fired a shot that ricocheted and struck Mr. Gurley in the heart. A three-month investigation followed as the city reeled from protests over a lack of charges in the case of Eric Garner, who died after a confrontation with police officers on Staten Island. After the Gurley inquiry, Mr. Thompson secured a manslaughter indictment against Mr. Liang, who was convicted this year.Then, in March, a month after the trial, Mr. Thompson announced that he wanted justice not revenge, and he asked the judge not to send Mr. Liang to prison. Demonstrations began almost immediately.Two weeks after Mr. Liang was sentenced, the furor found new fuel with the start of the trial of Marcell Dockery. Mr. Dockery, then 16, had set fire to a mattress in a hallway of his Coney Island high-rise in April 2014; the blaze that ensued killed a police officer. Mr. Dockery, who is black, was charged with felony murder, a provision of the law that permits even an unintentional death to be treated as a murder if the killing occurred while another major crime was being committed  in this case, arson. He was convicted this month and now faces 25 years to life prison.Though there were clear legal differences between the cases, many activists have found it hard to swallow the divergent outcomes.It hits a raw nerve when you see a police officer walk away from killing a young black man, especially when a young black man is looking at jail for killing a police officer, said Josmar Trujillo, an activist who runs New Yorkers Against Bratton, a reference to the police commissioner. Something about that crystallizes the injustice that people feel and see.In Twitter exchanges, Mr. Thompsons chief spokesman has asserted that any comparison between the Liang and Dockery cases is wrongheaded given the felony murder distinction.Some of the tension is rooted in the age-old battle between those who work for incremental remedies and those who reach for fundamental change.While Thompson has embraced reforms that acknowledge the limits of the punitive approach, hes still the district attorney and is operating in a punitive framework, said Alex S. Vitale, an associate professor of sociology at Brooklyn College who studies law enforcement issues. But the activist movement is feeling its power and wants dramatic action, not just someone tinkering with the system.The dispute also reflects a clash of perspectives that has surfaced many times after police killings across the country. It has been said  most notably by David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City  that activists, particularly black ones, look at these killings through the long lens of history, in which specific facts and individual cases dissolve into an overarching narrative of continuing abuse and a lack of accountability. But that, of course, is not the lens through which a district attorney, weighing evidence and making legal judgments, looks.The power structure, whether black or white, tends to focus on the incidents themselves, on what happened in the moment, Mr. Kennedy said. But theres a different way of looking, one that considers a very long history of agents of the law doing people harm.This difference of vision, Mr. Kennedy said, has become especially pronounced at a time when so many of the facts that inform the debate about policing are in flux and the battle lines of that debate are still being drawn. In the past two years alone, just in New York alone, impassioned arguments have occurred about the Police Departments stop-and-frisk policy, its community policing efforts, the usefulness of prosecuting minor crimes and the value of keeping Rikers Island as the citys main jail. On top of that, there have been many traumatic public events: Mr. Garners death, the widespread protests it inspired, a police revolt against Mr. de Blasio and the ambush killing of two officers in Brooklyn.In that context, Mr. Kennedy said, it was no surprise that the conversation has remained contentious  and occasionally confusing.The city and the country are in movement on these issues in a sudden, dramatic way, he said. Its very hard to sort out exactly whats going on."}
{"text": "How busy are we, exactly?The author and time management expert Laura Vanderkam decided to answer that question for herself. She tracked her time for an entire year (8,784 hours in a leap year), and in doing so learned her life was a bit less hectic than she thought. Ms. Vanderkam, a working mother of four young children, recently wrote in The Times about her experience.The article, The Busy Persons Lies, was widely viewed and shared and generated hundreds of comments. But it also left some of us with questions for Ms. Vanderkam, whose latest book is I Know How She Does It: How Successful Women Make the Most of their Time. I recently spoke with Ms. Vanderkam to find out exactly how she did it, the best apps for tracking time and why some people have been critical of her time-tracking advice. Heres an edited version of our conversation.How did you do this? Break it down for us  did you use a datebook, or an app?I used a spreadsheet. Its just an Excel worksheet, with the days of the week across the top and then blocks for the time, from 5 a.m. to 5 a.m. in half-hour increments. Its on my laptop, and it was pretty much open all the time.How often did you update it?Most weekdays I probably updated it between three and six times. If I wasnt at my laptop during the day, I kept a sort of a mental tally all day and filled it in in the evening. As long as youre looking at half-hour blocks and paying attention, not estimating, youre not likely to make big mistakes, the way you do if someone asks you, how much to you sleep, or how much do you work, and you just guess without any data. If youre tracking, youre going to be off by minutes, not hours, and youll still get the information you want.Whats the first step to tracking your time? How long a period should you track?Just choose a tool to use. The tool itself doesnt matter. You can use a spreadsheet, or one of a million time tracking apps, or a Moleskine notebook if you want to look all artsy. The key is to do it consistently. And a week is great, or even a few days. The longer you do, the more insights you get, but a week is enough to see patterns.Any apps you recommend?Toggl is free for the basic version. If you want to use an app, I suggest using that for a while, and see if you feel like you need any extra bells and whistles. Once you know what you like, you look for a paid app.What kinds of categories did you use?I didnt categorize until I was finished. I just wrote a brief description of what I did during that half hour  feed baby/email, speech, church, shop Target, work on train, things like that. I categorized later. I looked at work, sleep, exercise, housework and errands, TV, reading and time in the car, because those were the things I was interested in. Different people will have different categories. I could have pulled out different things, like child care, but as a mother of four who often works at home, so much of that is nebulous. Im pretty aware of it. But if I were concerned with whether I spent enough time with my kids, or wondering what those numbers looked like, I would have tallied that.Did you expect to be able to account for every hour out of your 24?No. Some people get hung up on this. Im not a perfectionist. If I ran on the treadmill for 27 minutes and spent three going upstairs and getting water, Im calling that 30 minutes of exercise. And the time thats sort of unclassifiable is fine with me  hanging out watching kids play, or flipping through a magazine. The big categories wont go wrong.Is there an issue with being honest with yourself? People always say, I never watch TV, but they seem to know everything that happens on Game of Thrones. Do you have to make a commitment to not lie to yourself to make this work?When I do this, its just for me. Which means that I dont think there is any reason to lie on it. If youre not happy with the amount of TV you watch, or whatever, time tracking is a good way to notice that. Just because you know where the time goes doesnt mean that you need to punish yourself for wasting it or feel bad about spending it the way you do. Are you happy, or not? If youre happy, celebrate that. Theres nothing wrong with sitting on the porch drinking a glass of wine and staring at the trees.But if you have open time and you dont ask yourself, what would make me happy  if you just spend that time mindlessly on Twitter because your phone is in your hand  then maybe this is your chance to ask what you want to do with that time that is meaningful. Life is what it is. Its just a matter of asking, now I know this. Do I want to keep it, or do I want to change it?One of the concerns in the comments on your The Busy Persons Lies piece is that time tracking is a luxury of the upper class. Is time tracking useful for people who dont have white-collar, flexible jobs?I think its still very useful. With some jobs, you know exactly how many hours you work  its right there on your check. But its still easy to have the rest of life go by mindlessly. Some of us need a reality check on work. Others want to check other things in their lives. We have only so many hours and a life is lived in hours. I think we all share an interest in figuring out where they go and if we are spending them in ways that are meaningful and enjoyable.I did see the comments that sort of relegated this to first-world problems. I could understand that better if I were complaining, but Im not. My point is that I see life as a working person in a prosperous country as very doable, and I think that is a good story to tell ourselves.Whats one of the most important things we can learn from tracking our time?Sometimes we dont want to own up to how much of time is a choice. But for many of us, there is a reasonable amount of choice in how we spend our days. Using the language of being busy lets us avoid responsibility for those choices.I always use the example of a woman whose water heater broke during the week when she was tracking her time, and it took her seven hours to deal with it. Any of us would say we dont have seven hours, but when we have water all over the basement floor, we find seven hours.How do we figure out what really matters to us, and how we can treat it like a broken water heater? Thats the big question.If you choose to track your time, and the results push you toward changes in how you spend time or how you think about it, let us know.

{"text": "What in the World offers you glimpses of what our journalists are observing around the globe. Let us know what you think: whatintheworld@nytimes.comMove over, Everest. Scientists say that by one measure, the worlds highest peak is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.The summit of Chimborazo, an inactive volcano in the Andes, rises about 20,500 feet above sea level, far short of Everests renowned 29,029 feet. But its a different story when you measure from the center of Earth: Chimborazos apex rises the farthest, at about 21 million feet or 3,967 miles, while Everests doesnt even crack the top 20.This is because, while Earth is not flat, it is also not a perfect sphere. The planet flattens at its poles and bulges slightly around its waistline  dont we all?  making its radius about 13 miles greater at the Equator. Chimborazo is close to the Equator, but Everest is 28 degrees north latitude, nearly one-third of the way to the pole.Mount Chimborazo has been anthropomorphized as a man in a stormy relationship with a shorter and more active female companion, the Tungurahua volcano, which is known to belch ash that lands on Chimborazos icy slopes. Josefina Vsquez, an archaeologist at the Universidad San Francisco in Quito, said that Chimborazo has been venerated since pre-Columbian times and is still a sacred mountain where its thought to be close to God.On a recent climb to commemorate the 280th anniversary of a 1736 mission by the adventurer Charles Marie de La Condamine, a research team led by the Institut de Recherche pour le Dveloppement in France found that Chimborazo was about 15 feet shorter than previously thought, but reaffirmed its status as the highest from the Earths center.So why does Everest get all the glory? Its all about the climb.Scaling Everest typically requires a 10-day trek to base camp, six weeks of acclimatizing, and a seven- to nine-day trip to the top. Climbing Chimborazo can be done in about two weeks, with a one- or two-day hike after acclimatization, according to Todd Burleson, president of Alpine Ascents International, a mountaineering company based in Seattle.Dont get me wrong, I wouldnt belittle the mountain, he said. Its an excellent training ground for big mountains.Ouch."}
{"text": "BIRZEIT, West Bank  When the $24 million Palestinian Museum celebrates its opening on Wednesday, it will have almost everything: a stunning, contemporary new building; soaring ambitions as a space to celebrate and redefine Palestinian art, history and culture; an outdoor amphitheater; a terraced garden.One thing the museum will not have is exhibitions.The long-planned  and much-promoted  inaugural show, Never Part, highlighting artifacts of Palestinian refugees, has been suspended after a disagreement between the museums board and its director, which led to the directors ouster. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and other dignitaries are expected to attend the opening ceremony, but a spokeswoman acknowledged on Sunday that there will not be any artwork exhibited in the museum at all.Omar al-Qattan, the museums chairman, said Palestinians were so in need of positive energy that it was worthwhile to open even an empty building. Symbolically its critical, he said, conceding that the next phase, including the exhibitions, is the more exciting one.In the West Bank, where Palestinians have for years struggled to build political and civic institutions while resisting Israels occupation of the territory, the fate of the exhibition may say as much about the realities of Palestinian society as any art collection could. Since the signing of the Oslo peace accords with Israel in the mid-1990s, Palestinian cultural and social initiatives have often failed to gain traction and find consistent leadership.Mustafa Bargouthi, head of the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, a nonprofit organization, said that the list of institutions struggling under occupation and other difficulties is lengthy. Among the groups that have suffered, Mr. Bargouthi said, are the Palestine National Orchestra, the Popular Art Center in Ramallah, dance groups across the West Bank, and road, agricultural and medical projects.Many Palestinian activists see the aging Mr. Abbas, 81, and his administration as increasingly feckless in their attempts to build an effective government, but a new generation has not risen to replace them. The museum is backed by a private organization, Taawon  Arabic for cooperation  and is not affiliated with any political entity.Sam Bahour, a Palestinian business consultant and human rights activist, said that considering the ossified state of many organizations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a managers being forced out could be considered a sign of institutional health, or at least lively debate. But he called the decision to open the museum without exhibitions shocking.If theres no substance, Mr. Bahour said, I wouldnt open it.Never Part, developed over several years by the ousted director, Jack Persekian, was to feature artistic interpretations of things like keys and photographs that Palestinians around the world have kept from the homes they fled or were forced from in what is now Israel.Mr. Persekian, who runs an art gallery called the Al Mamal Foundation for Contemporary Art in Jerusalem, said he had agreed to leave after the museums senior management unceremoniously told him that it no longer favored the project, but he said he did not know why.I cant fathom what happened, he said, offering a succinct description of the result of his work for the museum: Waste.Mr. Qattan, the museum chairman, said that his team had decided that Mr. Persekian had not sufficiently built expertise among staff members during his tenure of three and a half years, and that outside artists had criticized his conception of the exhibition.We didnt feel that what was delivered was up to scratch, Mr. Qattan said.Although there are a number of what Mr. Bahour called niche museums in the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian Museum would be the largest institution of its kind.The building, designed by Heneghan Peng, an architectural firm in Dublin, will host the high-profile opening ceremony a few days after the 68th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe  essentially, Israels founding and the conflict that followed, which displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.The spokeswoman said the ceremony was only to celebrate the completion of the building. She said it would be open to the public, free of charge, starting June 1, though it is unclear what will be inside to look at.The museum announced in a news release this month that it had named a new director, Mahmoud Hawari, whom it called the lead curator at the British Museumand a specialist in early Islamic art, architecture and archaeology, among other topics.A spokeswoman for the British Museum would not confirm that Mr. Hawari held the position of lead curator there, saying only that he was a visiting academic at the British Museum. A spokeswoman for Taawon said on Monday morning that the information in the release was based on a curriculum vitae that Mr. Hawari had provided.In the news release by the Palestinian museum, Mr. Hawari said it would be an institution that links Palestinians together, at home and in exile, wherever they may live.The museum also announced that on May 25, it will open a satellite exhibition in Beirut, Lebanon, called At the Seams: A Political History of Palestinian Embroidery. Mr. Qattan said the Beirut show would be the first of many such exhibitions outside the West Bank, which is difficult for many people to visit because it requires travel through Israel or border crossings it controls.Tafeeda Jarbawi, the director of Taawon  formerly called the Welfare Association  said erecting the museum was a critical achievement itself. She added that the understated lines of the structure, rising atop a terraced garden with carefully selected trees and other plants, expressed just what the organizers had hoped for.Its as if the building is coming out of the womb, the Palestinian Mother Nature, Ms. Jarbawi said. Really, it fits with the contour of the land.Mr. Qattan said future exhibitions might explore the cultural meaning of martyrdom, the debate over which people inhabited the area first  and whether that question makes historical sense  as well as the more recent departures of religious and ethnic minorities.If we as an independent institution cant tread into these tricky areas, then who is going to? Mr. Qattan said. Nobody is. Thats the power of culture.For Never Part, Mr. Persekian said he had collected images of countless artifacts from Palestinians around the world, conducted Skype interviews to document the stories behind those artifacts and planned to include physical objects as well. The objects would have been collected locally  across the West Bank for exhibitions in the museum here in Birzeit, a university town next to Ramallah, and in cities around the world for versions presented there.Mr. Persekian said he had intended to make all this material available to artists whose work involves archival material and research, and the artists could have interpreted the objects as they saw fit. For those in charge of the museums finances, he said, that may have caused unease.Maybe they didnt want to take a risk with something that is so unpredictable and so uncontrollable, he said.As for the parting in November, Mr. Persekian sought the high road, saying, They are the owners, and conceding that  as with any art project  no one could have said how it would have turned out, particularly because he was not sure what the precise reasons were.You will never be able to take sides on this, he said, because you never know: They might be right, and I might be wrong."}
{"text": "The anger, the hurt and the disappointment in Deontay Wilders voice was palpable  even from a few thousand miles away.Wilder is the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion. At 36-0 with 35 knockouts he is Americas best hope in years to unify the crown that once stood as the biggest title in sports. He had spent the past two weeks training in Sheffield, England, a transit camp on his road to a fight in Moscow on Saturday against the top-ranked contender, Alexander Povetkin.The $4.5 million purse was to be the largest of Wilders career. Beyond the money, the fight would have been Wilders shining moment, one so important that he had agreed to take on the Russian challenger in Moscow.The plan was simple: Go into Povetkins hometown, knock him out and announce to the world that Wilder was the heavyweight divisions new truth.But on Friday, the plan went to pieces.Wilder learned that Povetkin had tested positive for meldonium, a banned performance-enhancing drug, and the fight was postponed.Im very upset, Wilder said Sunday from Sheffield. They stole the fight. Not just from me and my family, but from all the fight fans who were looking forward to this fight.We can talk in broad strokes about the doping scandal that has engulfed Russian sports, about the Olympic medals and world championships that may have been won  and lost  unfairly in recent years. Those stories are compelling but not universally so. Certainly not for fans who make their bets, cheer their teams and support their favorite athletes regardless of whispers about P.E.D. use.But for Wilder, a charismatic champion on the verge of a breakthrough moment, the scandal suddenly became personal.This brought it home, Wilder said. This was a cowards way out. I have no respect for athletes who cheat their way to the top. I dont even see how you can live with yourself, knowing that you had to cheat to get what you got. How can you look yourself in the mirror?We can debate whether it is worse to have lost to someone who had an illegal advantage, or to have missed a chance to compete at all because an opponent was busted.But when cheating hits you in the wallet, you pay attention.I should be paid in full, when you look at what I put my body through, Wilder said. Look at all the training, all the preparation, being away from home. And he should be suspended.What now? Wilder will make a mandatory title defense against whomever the W.B.C. deems the top contender. The W.B.C. also will decide whether to suspend Povetkin from fighting for its belt. (Various state commissions in the United States can suspend Povetkin, but such a suspension is effectively toothless because the Russian most likely will not fight in the United States.)For Wilder, already on the back side of 30, the waste of even a few months can be devastating for a career that started late. Theres no guarantee that such a large payday ever will come again.Wilder was born in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and did not start boxing until he was 19. He said he was inspired to enter the ring after his daughter, Naieya, was born with spina bifida. Wilder dropped out of Shelton State Community College to support his daughter and began concentrating all of his energies on boxing.In 2008, he won a bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics. Soon afterward he turned pro.Media friendly and accessible, Wilder became known as a big puncher and a knockout artist. Povetkin would have provided the high-profile opponent Wilder needed to validate his rapid rise and to put him in position to solidify the fragmented heavyweight division in which two British fighters, Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, hold the other belts.Wilder was ready to go through with the fight this weekend, even if Povetkin would have entered the ring from the moral low ground.He was coming to fight me with a knife in his hands, Wilder said. I was going to fight him with my hands.Wilders camp, led by the veteran promoter Lou DiBella, was furious after the positive drug test was revealed.Its taking money out of the young mans pocket after he went through all the work, DiBella said. He spent months training, getting into peak condition, working out every day, sparring, putting wear and tear on his body.He literally had finished his training and was preparing to pack his bags and go from England to Russia, DiBella said. This was going to be a defining moment for him.Instead, Wilder flew back to Tuscaloosa on Monday to be with his family and to pick up the pieces of his broken dream. He cannot say for sure when he will fight next.Ive done all the right things, Wilder said. Now it looks like Ive come to a dead end.With the fight postponed and the big money off the table, a doping scandal that was on the periphery of Wilders radar has hit him squarely on his jaw.Now, its personal."}
{"text": "When the British singer Barb Jungr was growing up in Manchester, she recalled on Saturday evening, the images on an album cover of South Pacific gave her the illusion that a tropical island was a safe, paradisiacal refuge. At Joes Pub, where she is performing songs from her new album, Shelter From the Storm: Songs of Hope for Troubled Times, Ms. Jungr, in a green silk shirt, shell necklace and black slacks, appeared as Bloody Mary and sang Bali Hai with a trio that included the piano virtuoso Laurence Hobgood, Wilson Torres on percussion and Matt Clohesy on bass. These brilliant musicians lifted the performance out of the realm of cabaret and into jazz.Ms. Jungr is not afraid to be goofy, and her playfulness during a program whose songs addressed the generalized anxiety about the future injected a dash of humor into a troubling question: Where do we go when global catastrophe strikes? Ms. Jungr countered that sense of dread with an attitude that could only be described as jolly. She never stopped moving, and wore a beatific smile.The album title refers to the Bob Dylan song from Blood on the Tracks. Ms. Jungr, a passionate Dylanologist, can squeeze more juice out of a Dylan song than just about anybody. But her approach is less archaeological than intuitive. Analyzing the song, she suggested that each verse is a miniature Shakespearean play, and thats how she performed it.A strong, mambo-driven rendition of Somethings Coming from West Side Story introduced the shows theme of ominous anticipation, but in a cheerful voice. Mr. Dylans All Along the Watchtower and David Bowies Life on Mars pursued the possibilities of warning and escape. And Bruce Springsteens Long Walk Home described the desolation of a small town where the narrator grew up.When she sang Joni Mitchells Woodstock, the self-adoring proclamation We are stardust, we are golden sounded nave. The words bomber jet planes riding shotgun in the sky and caught in the devils bargain stood out. Yes, something momentous is indeed coming."}
{"text": "With only one episode to go, a couple of things are clear: Tom Hiddleston looks absolutely beautiful in the golden light of an airplane cabin window. There is a particular sort of terror to sitting in the middle of an all-male mercenary encampment wearing a lacy nglige. In a physical fight to the death, the man whos a foot and a half taller is likely to win. When a slick, clever bad guy starts making not-terribly artful Apocalypse Now references, its maybe time for him to retire.This was a brutal episode. Corkys neck snapping, and Jeds neck being stroked with all the tenderness of the robber girl using her knife to tickle the neck of her reindeer in The Snow Queen.Could there be anything more sinister than the words You know I love you very much from Richard Onslow Roper? (His Jesus, Corky, Corky did, however, have a certain ring of real feeling.)It was nice to see Langbourne  interrupted in his champagne-pouring by Ropers vulgar bark  shaken out of his habitual aristocratic torpor. Not so nice to see Frisky all playful and happy post-Corky burial. Hes downright loquacious in this episode. Making small talk! (Its not like im to mix business and pleasure upon Jeds arrival.) Making a joke! (Aye, but with no mum, to Ropers big happy family. I had to replay it three times to make out the words  thought Id save you the effort.)I was surprised to see how readily Jonathan told Jed the truth about his identity and activities. I thought shed sell him out, and pronto, but I was wrong. Once she finds out about her friend Corky, I fear, things could get complicated. Assuming that she stays alive long enough for complications. Now that were back in Cairo and Jonathan is having flashbacks outside the Hatshepsut suite, I fear we may get a bloody repeat of the Sophie affair. Especially now that Jonathan has made the fateful vow: Im going to get you out of here. I promise.Certainly, were in for some trouble when Jonathan comes face-to-face with Ropers friend Freddie Hamid. Indeed, is that Ropers plan?Didnt watch the cups, you see? he chided Jonathan, as his trucks, filled with bona fide farm equipment, passed through the United States border check while Angela and Joel looked on in disbelief. Oh dear, as Corky might have said. Did Jonathan overplay his hand?I would like others to weigh in here with their feelings about the murderous sound and light show that Jonathan emceed for the London School of Economics-educated Mr. Barghati. On first watch, I found it painful, both in terms of its gratuitous, sadistic violence, and also in terms of its absurdity: How could this pass for normal activity in a refugee camp 200 miles from perhaps the most-watched border on the planet? But on second viewing, I thought: The gleeful cigar-chomping, the golf-playing in that garish bathrobe and boots; the eye-twitching, the sudden screaming  theyre all perhaps meant to be signifiers of crazy.I thought, on first viewing, that Hugh Laurie was playing things up too much this week. Hed gone full villain (like Robert Downey Jr.s full retard in Tropic Thunder, a place where an actor should never go). But now I think that this was perhaps intentional. Hes in his kingdom. He and Andrew are emperors of Rome.Is Roper not just evil but certifiably insane?"}
{"text": "Still reeling from revelations that forced the resignation of its founder and chief executive, Lending Club said on Monday that it had received a subpoena from the Justice Department.The company, which serves as an online matchmaker between small-business borrowers and individual and institutional lenders, disclosed the grand jury subpoena in a regulatory filing, saying it intended to cooperate with the federal investigation.A week ago, Lending Club, which is based in San Francisco, revealed that its founder and chief, Renaud Laplanche, had resigned after an internal investigation discovered fabrications in about $3 million of loan applications.The internal inquiry turned up other problems, including the sale of $22 million of loans to the investment bank Jefferies that Lending Club employees knew did not meet certain of Jeffriess specifications.The internal review also revealed that Mr. Laplanche had invested in a fund that was buying the companys loans without informing the Lending Club board, which includes prominent members like Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and former Harvard University president.The disclosure of a criminal subpoena, which the company received last Monday  the day it announced Mr. Laplanches departure  is another big blow to Lending Club. Once considered the pioneer in its field, Lending Club is now fighting to defend the soundness of its business model.Even before the internal problems became public, Lending Club and other marketplace lenders had been having trouble selling their loans because of growing doubts about the long-term viability of their business.Marketplace lending  which is fast and efficient  had been considered a potential disruptive force to the banking establishment, but now some analysts question whether it can bounce back from the recent turmoil. When it went public in December 2014, Lending Clubs stock closed at $23.43 a share. On Monday, it closed just shy of $4 a share."}
{"text": "I want to talk to you about scary markets. For the sake of this particular subject, I want to be blunt and a little bit in your face. So for the next few minutes, please, just think of me less as your friend and more as your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant. O.K.? Great.Now, you may be saying to yourself, Why is he talking about this now? The markets arent even that scary. Thats true. And its also true that I cant predict when the next bad market is coming.But I can predict that another bad market will come again, eventually. And when it does, youll want to have a plan. Thats precisely why now is such a good time to hash this out. Because you dont wait until your house is in flames to buy a fire extinguisher, right?Let me set the stage for you. Its sometime in the near future. The market just got really scary, like 2008 or 2009 scary. You and I are sitting down together for lunch to talk about what you should do. Were going to start with a couple of assumptions. First, you have a portfolio that was built specifically and intentionally to give you the greatest likelihood of reaching your goals. Second, your portfolio is down 20 percent or more, and you want to sell all of your investments and go to cash because that feels safest.But before you do that, before you make this huge, drastic decision, I will have a little conversation with you. Heres how that conversation would go.Me: Why are you invested the way you are?You: Because this portfolio gives me the greatest chance of meeting my goals.Me: Are your goals still the same?You: Yes, theyre still the same.Me: O.K., great. Step one, you own the right portfolio. Check.Lets pause there a moment for dramatic effect and reiterate that you have the right portfolio. Back to the conversation.You: But I just cant take it anymore! Ive got to sell everything.Me: Got it. Now, just so I understand, if you do that, is that going to be a permanent decision? In other words, are you getting out of the stock market forever?You: Well, no...Me: O.K., then. So when do you think you are likely to get back in?You: When things settle down!Lets hit pause again.Now we know three very important things. You have the right portfolio. Youre not going to abandon the stock market permanently. Youre going to reinvest when things clear up.Lets flesh this out a bit. I want you to imagine what it will be like when things clear up. So why dont you go ahead and answer just a few more questions from your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant: When the market clears up, will it be less scary than it is now? When the market clears up, will the economy be better? When the market clears up, will that guy on the financial pornography network be telling everyone and their mother to buy more stocks? When the market clears up, will all your neighbors and friends be sitting around the barbecue grill again chatting about investing?We all know the answers to those questions: yes, yes, yes and yes.But one last question. Drum roll please: If the market isnt scary, the economy is better, the guy on the financial pornography network is yelling buy, buy, buy! and everyone you know is planning to invest, how do you think the market then will compare to the market now?Itll be much higher, of course!So, to review: Your plan is to sell your perfectly tailored portfolio, right now while your investments are down. Then, youre going to wait until the market improves. When it does, youre going to buy back Plan A at a much higher price.To which I say: Seriously?I hate to be annoying, but I really want to hammer this conversation home. It doesnt make a lick of sense to sell a portfolio tailored for you when the market is low, and then buy it back when the market is higher. It makes infinitely more sense to simply keep your portfolio through the scary times and tough it out. Right, soldier?Instead of doing what fear is making you want to do, just think back to your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant and remember these three things: You made your portfolio based on your goals. It still matches your goals. If you sell that portfolio now and buy it back later when the markets are better, all you will do is lose money.Its that simple. Just. Dont. Do it.Think of this as something of a lifeboat drill. This is meant to help you remember that when the ship goes down and you find yourself in the lifeboat scared and cold, you dont throw common sense to the wind and jump in the icy water. Just stay in the rescue boat, tough it out through the turbulent times and wait until the next big ship comes to pick you up to carry you safely to your destination."}
{"text": "WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  There are those people who prefer not to see letters spelled out in crosswords  like EFFS for Fs  but my theory is that, if you wait long enough, there will always be some constructor who finds a way to make it acceptable. Today, Zhouqin Burnikel has done just that. And shes taken it a step further, so that her theme hits you like a one-two punch.I read the clue list over at least once before I start solving, so I immediately recognized that we were going to have to find something unusual in the Across theme clues when I saw the What X-Across has, phonetically clues in the Downs. What they have is four of the same letter in each entry.So we have a theme entry like ANTARCTIC CIRCLE at 17A and we need to figure out what it has, phonetically, that Ms. Burnikel is hinting at in 4D. If you havent already guessed, the phrase has four Cs.  I figured early on that we were going to be counting up letters, although the best surprise about this theme was yet to be revealed.There are a few things, in my opinion, that make this particular theme set special. The first  and least surprising  is that Ms. Burnikel found three entries that have four of the same letter in them. The second, which is more elegant, is that Ms. Burnikel was able to cross her Across theme entries with the Down counterparts. But the best part, in my opinion, is the fact that she recognized that those Down theme entries do not have to be literal: If you were going to fill in FOUR CEES at 4D, youd be wrong. The answer is actually FORESEES. Similarly, the phrase THATS A MOOT POINT has FORTIES (four Ts) and FANTASY BASEBALL has FORAYS (four As).Now thats neat. Many of todays clues relied on specific knowledge of a topic, like 50As Singer with the #1 hit Tik Tok, or KESHA, or that the source of comets is the OORT cloud. Some exceptions to the above: 42As It may be put in a bun refers to HAIR, not a burger. Also, Worrisome call at home does not, thankfully, refer to a call from the police (I have children who drive, so thats where my brain goes), but to baseball, and the answer is STRIKE TWO.Lets hear from our constructor:I normally avoid 3/6/4 edge breakup, but the theme intersection in this grid made the design necessary. It gave me the smoothest fill.A terrific midweek outing. Thanks, Ms. Burnikel.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  When pitchers were intentionally walking Barry Bonds more than anyone else in baseball history, his father had a simple message for him.Its your fault, Bobby Bonds told his son. You didnt have to be this good.That is what Barry Bonds thinks when he sees Bryce Harper getting so many free passes to first base. But he also believes Harper, an outfielder for the Washington Nationals and the reigning most valuable player of the National League, needs to diversify his game if opposing teams are going to take the bat out of his hands.Hes going to need to learn to steal bases and get to second base and make his teammates job easier, Bonds recently told The Associated Press.The Chicago Cubs walked Harper 13 times during their four-game sweep of the Nationals this month, including four times intentionally, and he scored only three runs. Bonds, baseballs intentional walk king, said too much was being made of Ryan Zimmermans struggles batting behind Harper.Teammates had bad series hitting behind Bonds when he was intentionally walked, too. But Bonds remembers what he said to his children during his playing days.My kids used to tell me, Daddy, Im sorry they walk you all the time, said Bonds, who led baseball in intentional walks 12 times and holds the record for most in a career with 688. I said, Yeah, but my jobs now to steal. I could run then, so I had to steal bases and my jobs to score runs and keep the pressure on the team regardless of what happened. But I had a different game than him.Bonds stole 514 bases during his 22-year major league career. Harper, now in his fifth season, has 43. Stealing more bases, Bonds said, would make Harper, 23, a five-tool player.That does not mean that Bonds believes Harper is doing anything wrong.Bryce Harper can only do what his job is, Bonds said. If they walk him, his job is to go to first base and then run bases. His teammates job is to drive him in. Bryce Harper can only do what hes capable of doing and what hes given the opportunity to do.After the final game of the series against the Cubs, Harper said he was walked a lot during high school and that he could not get frustrated if the treatment continued.Youre getting on base, and thats what your team asks you to do, Harper said. If I can get on base every time I get up there, Im doing it the right way. If its a hit, a walk, I get drilled or whatever. Get on base. Maybe steal second, steal third and get it done.Dusty Baker, who managed the San Francisco Giants during Bonds heyday and is now managing Harper with the Nationals, is the common thread between the two superstars. Baker said the onus was on Harpers teammates to make opponents pay for all the walks.When Bonds was playing, Baker did not have to give him any advice because he could lean on the experiences of his father and his godfather, Willie Mays.I knew how to deal with it, said Bonds, who is now the hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. I had my own father in me. I had my dad and Willie. I had enough pressure with those two that I didnt need to add more with Dusty.Harper has plenty of pressure on him as the face of the franchise and one of the best players in baseball, but he can only hit what he is thrown. Bonds became baseballs home run king with 762 despite walking a major-league-leading 2,558 times.Bonds estimated that he lost four or five years of at-bats from walks. Still, if he were pitching to Harper, he said, he would not give him much to hit.If I was a pitcher and I need to leave it in the ballpark, Im going to pick somebody whos going to leave it in the ballpark more than someone who has a chance to hit it out of the ballpark, he said. Not every time, but there will be a situation. Even me as a pitcher, hes going to have to walk if its the game on the line."}
{"text": "In an industry where hostile takeovers are rare, Gannett is not giving up its pursuit of Tribune Publishing, sweetening its bid on Monday just weeks after its first offer was resoundingly rejected.Gannett, publisher of USA Today, has been making an aggressive push to buy Tribunes portfolio, which includes The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, as circulation and advertising revenue for traditional newspapers are in a sharp and seemingly irreversible decline.Its latest move was perhaps to give Tribune a proposal it could not refuse. Gannett raised its cash bid 22 percent, to $15 a share, from the $12.25 a share Tribune rejected on May 4. Gannetts stock gained 2.2 percent after the higher bid was announced on Monday, while Tribunes shares soared 23 percent and closed almost a dollar below the offer price. The deal, which includes the assumption of Tribunes debt, is now worth about $864 million, up from $815 million last month.It is evident from our discussions with Tribune shareholders that there is overwhelming support for the companies to engage immediately regarding our proposed transaction, John J. Louis, Gannetts chairman, said in a statement.Tribune said its board was contemplating the latest offer.Price is only one factor for Tribune. Pride is another.Over the last year, Tribunes shares have fallen, weighed down by management turnover, accounting weaknesses and an acquisition that was thwarted by regulators.The investor and entrepreneur Michael Ferro acquired a 16.5 percent stake in Tribune Publishing in February through his Chicago-based private equity firm, Merrick Ventures. He acquired the shares at $8.50 each, well below both of Gannetts offers.Mr. Ferro, a relative newcomer to the media industry, quickly installed Justin C. Dearborn, another media outsider, as chief executive. Gannett pounced shortly thereafter.Instead, Tribune has drawn the battle lines. In a presentation last week, the company said it was opposed to a steal  Gannetts proposal is an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of a depressed Tribune stock price and a company in the midst of a strategic transformation. The presentation was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.It also adopted a so-called shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to make its shares less attractive to a buyer.Mr. Ferro and Mr. Dearborn, both of whom have a background in technology, have been focused on investing in areas such as artificial intelligence to raise revenue. Tribunes executives have been promoting a strategy called Tronc, which involves pooling assets and using technology to extract more value from advertisers.But Gannett is taking a different approach. It has been consolidating newspaper companies to extract costs and streamline operations. It has said it believes the takeover will be better for Tribune shareholders than the Tronc. Combining the two companies would expand Gannetts portfolio to nearly 120 newspapers.By not engaging constructively with Gannett and continuing to pursue an unproven strategy based on its Tronc platform, we believe Tribune is jeopardizing its shareholders investment and disregarding their best interests, said Robert J. Dickey, Gannetts president and chief executive, in the statement Monday.When Tribune rejected the first bid a few weeks ago, it said the offer understates the companys true value and is not in the best interests of our shareholders. The company has not indicated yet whether it would be more amenable to Mondays bid.In a separate statement Monday, Tribune said it would thoroughly review Gannetts revised proposal.Gannett raised its bid after further review that gave the company greater confidence in its ability to extract operational benefits from the transaction. Its analysis was based on publicly available financial statements, including Tribunes latest earnings report, which showed more cash and less debt.We like the general strategy that Gannett has outlined over the next several years to be a consolidator in the industry, said Tony Scherrer, director of research and co-portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management. His firm oversees $2.4 billion in assets and owns about 5 percent of Gannett shares. Tribune Publishing has some waterfront assets that they can put into their portfolio and use their top-notch management capabilities to extract value from these assets.Gannett was also maneuvering to take the matter to shareholders. Because it missed the window to nominate its own directors to Tribunes board, the company sought another route instead. To increase pressure, Gannett decided to solicit so-called withhold votes, encouraging Tribune shareholders to boycott their votes for the director nominees.Methuselah Advisors is advising Gannett, as is the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Goldman Sachs and Lazard are providing financial advice to Tribune Publishing, with Kirkland & Ellis on the legal side."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re U.S. Issues Notice on Students Who Are Transgender (front page, May 13): The Obama administrations bold directive to public schools outlining their obligations under federal law to protect transgender students puts forth a laudable and reasonable approach to recognizing the dignity and well-being of all students with practical and concrete guidance for educators and schools.Arguments that ensuring appropriate bathroom access to transgender students infringes on the rights of other students are no different than the arguments made when bathrooms and other venues marked for colored only were integrated in the 1960s. Those arguments are just as false today as they were then.As Vanita Gupta, the head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, made clear last week: Transgender women are women and transgender men are men. This directive is a common-sense approach, not to mention entirely consistent with well-settled discrimination case law.SETH M. MARNINVice President, Civil RightsAnti-Defamation LeagueNew YorkTo the Editor:Here is the essence of the administrations directive to schools to permit use of restroom and locker room facilities on the basis of gender identification rather than biological sex: A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so (emphasis added). In that regard, the directive notes that the desire to accommodate others discomfort cannot justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages a particular class of students.In other words, efforts to reasonably accommodate the needs of an infinitesimally small minority, in a manner likely to cause no controversy and attract little attention, will not do. As to the age-old social norms and privacy expectations of everybody else  well, tough.Can there be a better example of so-called progressive ideology run riot?HOWARD F. JAECKELNew YorkTo the Editor:Remember Rachel Dolezal, the former head of a local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.  a white woman who identified as black and was out of a job when it was determined she was white? What is all this nonsense about identifying being hailed as a criterion for fair treatment?If the Obama administration is determining that protecting students who identify as a particular gender  regardless of their biological gender  is worth withholding federal money, why was Ms. Dolezal condemned for her identifying-as-black activities? There is a double standard at work here.Society either protects identifying or it does not.ELINOR HITECarrollton, Tex.To the Editor:If President Obamas order for transgender bathroom access in all public schools can prevent one tortured teenager from committing suicide, his mission will have been accomplished. The world can indeed be mean and cruel. Its no wonder that teenage suicide among transgender youths is high and so many drop out of school.JoANN LEE FRANKClearwater, Fla.To the Editor:Re Lawmaker Has a Mothers Role in a Rights Fight (front page, May 16):While I sympathize with Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinens support of her transgender son, I cant help but wonder at the hypocrisy of most Republicans opposition to gay and transgender rights until they face the issue in their own homes.Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, of course, should be applauded for her motherly love and instinct to support her son after reading a note he left saying he was transgender, publicly distancing herself from her partys position on transgender rights. But her fellow Republicans should take pause and reflect on what their positions might be if they found such a note from one of their children.DAN GREENBURGMerrick, N.Y.To the Editor:Those who support laws requiring people to use the public bathroom designated for the sex listed on their birth certificate should consider this: In North Carolina, under such a law, Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the bearded, very masculine young man whose photograph appears in the article, is required to use the womens room. No discretion, no individualization: He goes to the ladies. So much for the argument of protecting ones daughters from seeing someone who looks like a man there.Gender is neither binary nor always externally obvious. It is complex. Any attempt to dichotomize gender based on one criterion (in this case, a birth certificate) cannot work in all cases.JON D. MORROWNew York"}
{"text": "Pandora Media, the largest Internet radio service, has become the target of an activist shareholder who is urging the company to renew plans to sell itself.Corvex Management, a hedge fund managed by Keith Meister, has taken a 9.9 percent stake in Pandora by acquiring 22.7 million shares and share equivalents, making it the largest shareholder, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. Corvexs stake is worth about $230 million at Mondays closing stock price.Pandora had enlisted the help of Morgan Stanley to field preliminary takeover conversations, people briefed on the matter said in February. However, those discussions did not get far, and in March, the company replaced Brian P. McAndrews as chief executive with Tim Westergren, the companys co-founder and former chief strategy officer.Comments from Mr. Westergren since he has been appointed chief executive suggest an unwillingness to consider a sale regardless of the price offered to shareholders or the cost and uncertainty inherent in a stand-alone business plan, said Mr. Meister in a letter to Jim Feuille, chairman of Pandora, that was disclosed in the filing.As a result, Mr. Meister urged Pandora to hire a new firm to pursue a sale, or what the fund calls a value maximization process.We are confidently investing to fully capture the massive opportunity ahead of us, Pandora said in a statement. Our management team is in constant dialogue with shareholders about our business strategy and committed to delivering results and long-term value.A representative Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Pandoras large user base might appeal to buyers like traditional media companies, Internet giants or other companies in the music industry, Macquarie analysts said in a research report.Mr. Meister said that he delivered a notice of intent to nominate three directors at Pandoras annual meeting this year, but withdrew after conversations with executives and other board members demonstrated a willingness to enhance shareholder value. He said he was surprised by the appointment of Mr. Westergren as chief executive.Shares of Pandora jumped 3.5 percent in after-hours trading once Corvex disclosed its filling. The company trades at a market valuation around $2.3 billion, with another $200 million or so in debt.Pandoras former chief executive, Mr. McAndrews, is a director at The New York Times Company."}
{"text": "PITTSBURGH  Sidney Crosby beat Andrei Vasilevskiy from the circle 40 seconds into overtime, and the Penguins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning, 3-2, in Pittsburgh on Monday night to leave the N.H.L. Eastern Conference finals tied at a game apiece.Crosby, who had not scored in the postseason since the opening round against the Rangers, took a feed from Bryan Rust and buried it for his fourth goal of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Matt Cullen and Phil Kessel also scored for the Penguins.Matt Murray overcame a shaky start to finish with 19 saves as Pittsburgh improved to 3-1 in overtime in the postseason.They generated a lot, and he still made some great saves, kept us in it, Crosby said.Anton Stralman scored in his return to the lineup from a fractured left leg, and Jonathan Drouin picked up his second goal in two games, but the Lightning lost for just the third time in 12 postseason games when Vasilevskiy could not handle Crosbys wrist shot.Vasilevskiy played brilliantly at times while filling in for injured starter Ben Bishop, making 38 stops.Game 3 is Wednesday night in Tampa.The Penguins pointed to an inability to generate quality chances from in close as a major problem in Game 1. In danger of falling behind by two games for the first time in the postseason, Pittsburgh wasted little time trying to make Vasilevskiy uncomfortable, scoring two early goals on scrambles from in front.Cullen, 39, pounded home a rebound 4 minutes 32 seconds in for his fourth goal of the playoffs. Just over five minutes later Kessel darted in from the point and zipped one by Vasilevskiy to give the Penguins control before the first period was halfway complete.In the span of three minutes, Pittsburghs momentum vanished. Stralman collected a pretty cross-ice feed from Jonathan Marchessault and lifted the puck over Murrays outstretched glove to cut the lead in half with 3:23 to go in the first, and Drouins knuckler from the right circle tied it with 70 seconds remaining.Lightning Coach Jon Cooper predicted that the opener, which included two illegal hits that ended with Penguins defensemen Kris Letang and Brian Dumoulin woozily making their way off the ice, may end up being the tamest of the series. Yet the fireworks never really developed, although Ryan Callahans absence might have had something to do with that.Callahans elbow to the back of Letangs neck that sent Letang headfirst into boards set a surprisingly chippy tone for two teams that have little playoff history. Callahans chop drew a five-minute major but no further discipline from the league, though Callahan found himself out of the lineup anyway after falling ill before the game.Save for the usual heightened postseason pushing and shoving, both teams kept to themselves.Still, the return of the smooth skating Stralman gave the Lightning a boost at the blue line. Making his first appearance since March 25, he was on the ice during Cullens score but picked up his fifth career playoff goal when he roofed it by Murray, the Penguins rookie who has been steady since taking over in Game 3 in the opening round."}

{"text": "Efforts to diversify Americas corporate boards with more minorities and women are still lagging, and Hispanics, in particular, are far behind other groups in being selected for directorships, according to an annual report on the board composition of large companies.Over all, 399 new directors were selected for the top company boards last year. Hispanics claimed only 4 percent of those appointments, or 16 seats. The gap has widened over the last seven years, according to Heidrick & Struggles Board Monitor, which has tracked board appointments since 2009.The percentage of Hispanics appointed to such boards has not improved in recent years, even as they comprise 17 percent of the overall U.S. population, said Bonnie W. Gwin, a co-managing partner of the executive recruitment companys global C.E.O. and board practice.That compares with increases in directorships for women and African-Americans, but a decline in the number of Asians and Asian-Americans picked to fill board positions.Women made up 29.8 percent of the new directors named last year, up slightly from 29.2 percent in 2014, according to the board monitor, which tracks proxy filings, news releases and other corporate disclosures about board membership.Even as the percentage of new women directors has been rising each year, from 18 percent in 2009, the board monitor said it had revised downward a projection that women would reach parity with men in the number of new directors by 2024. It now predicts that women will make up 50 percent of new directors by 2026.African-Americans made modest strides, accounting last year for 9.3 percent of new directors, up from 8.3 percent in 2014. The percentage of African-Americans, who in 2014 made up 12.4 percent of the population in the United States, rose from 5.3 percent of new directors in 2009 to 10.3 percent in 2013, but it has since declined.Asians and Asian-Americans also lost some ground, accounting for only 4.8 percent of board seats filled in 2015, according to the report. That was down from 5.3 percent in 2014. Generally, their appointments have stayed steady in recent years, closely paralleling the share of Asians in the population, which was 5.3 percent in 2014.For minorities, the biggest obstacle to gaining entry to the boardroom is lack of operating or financial experience, Ms. Gwin said. Last year, 73.2 percent of newly appointed directors were current chief executives or chief financial officers, the report found. In addition, board seats do not turn over quickly. Last year, for example, only 8.5 percent of board seats changed hands.And their replacements are not young. The average age of the new directors was 58, the same as the year before. Some attribute this to an innately conservative business culture; others point to networks of white men who connect through college, work and social activities and who feel more comfortable with people who look like them.The absence of Hispanic board members appears to come, in large part, from the shortage of Hispanic chief executives, said Cid D. Wilson, president and chief executive of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility.Only nine Hispanics currently serve as chief executives of Fortune 500 companies, he noted, including Carlos Rodriguez, chief executive of ADP, and Oscar Munoz, chief executive of United Airlines.This leads to a shortage of Hispanic candidates being considered for board seats, Mr. Wilson said.The United States has the second-largest Spanish-speaking population in the world, second only to Mexico, he noted.Companies need to do more to recruit Latinos into the boardroom if they are to compete successfully for the growing Latino consumers and future talent, said Mr. Wilson, whose association hosts programs to help board prospects gain skills and experience to increase their chances of being considered for openings.Over all, choosing board candidates who are sitting or retired chief executives slows the advancement of diversity in the boardroom, Ms. Gwin said, because the pool of current and former C.E.O.s is not sufficiently diverse.She added, Experienced general managers, finance executives and functional leaders also can make significant contributions in the boardroom."}
{"text": "AMC prides itself on the large number of young viewers who regularly watch its television shows. Now, the network is trying to take one of its shows to young viewers who may not already be watching.On Monday, the cable network will introduce an advertising campaign in which the first five minutes of Preacher, the networks much-hyped new series, will be able to be viewed from within Snapchat, the messaging smartphone app popular with millennials.Though many networks buy ads on Snapchat to promote their shows, this is the first time that an extended clip of a network television show will be available, according to both companies. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. AMC plans to make the clip exclusive to Snapchat for a period of 24 hours before broadcasting it more widely on other platforms. (The clip will be available on Snapchat for a week.) Preacher is set to make its network debut on Sunday.Snapchat users can find the five-minute video clip inside of Snapchat Discover, a section of the app where third-party publishers like BuzzFeed, Daily Mail and National Geographic directly post content daily.While AMC regularly promotes shows across social channels, the campaign is another step in the networks quest to meet millennials in the places and the apps where they spend the most time. (Snapchat says it has 100 million active daily users.)Obviously its a terrific platform for this younger audience, Linda Schupack, executive vice president of marketing for AMC and SundanceTV, said in an interview. The audience we think will sync up perfectly with Preacher is already on Snapchat.It is also the networks effort to turn Preacher, a darkly comedic drama based on a cult-hit comic series, into another flagship show like The Walking Dead and its spinoff series, Fear The Walking Dead, which regularly have sizable audiences in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic most attractive to advertisers.With The Walking Dead in particular, AMC has tried to capitalize on the shows young fan base, much of which regularly takes to social sites like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit to talk about the show in the hours after episodes air on television. Talking Dead, the networks hourlong live discussion in which different members of the cast and creative team chat with celebrities about the weeks most recent episode, was a direct result of the series enthusiastic following.But Snapchat is an interesting choice for AMC to focus its marketing muscle on, particularly because of the platforms regular pitch to brands and publishers that it is the best suited to handling video. For nearly a year, Snapchat has likened itself more to television than its competitors, pitching advertisers that it is focused on hourly time spent watching video and daily use of the app. Other tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube continue to compete for the same video advertising dollars.AMC has spread its advertising clout across nearly all of these new media platforms thus far, though the network hopes this particular ad buy will pay off in a swath of cheerleading young fans for the new series.For millennials, the thrill of discovery is really important, Ms. Schupack said. Our hope is to turn our fans into evangelists by getting Preacher to them ahead of the premiere."}
