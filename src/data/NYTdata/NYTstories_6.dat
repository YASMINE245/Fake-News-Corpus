The stamps feature an artists rendering of the yellow probe and a color-enhanced, composite image of Pluto taken during the flyby that prominently features its heart-shaped mark.The 1991 stamp that showed Pluto not yet explored highlighted some important, unfinished business for NASAs first exploration of the planets of our solar system, S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for the New Horizons mission, said in a statement.Im thrilled that 25 years later, these new stamps recognize that Pluto has indeed been explored by the New Horizons spacecraft and revealed to be a complex and fascinating world.NASA and the Postal Service also released a stamp collection called Views of our Planets, which showcase our solar systems eight planets ( Pluto was downgraded to a dwarf in 2006).Some of the photos featured on these stamps came from New Horizons predecessors, like the Messenger spacecraft for Mercury and Voyager 2 with Neptune. The images of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus came from the Hubble Space Telescope. Earths Blue Marble was made using the weather satellite Suomi NPP, which orbits the planet 14 times a day.The post office issued the stamps on the occasion of the World Stamp Show-NY 2016, an international conference that draws an estimated 250,000 stamp collectors.If youre a philatelist or astronomy enthusiast you can snag sheets of the stamps online. Or just wait until the individual stamps journey to your mailbox  which shouldnt be more difficult than traveling to Pluto, right?"}

{"text": "THE PAINTER OF SOULSBy Philip Kazan261 pp. Pegasus Books. $24.95.If the Brancacci Chapel in Florence is small in scale, its place in the history of Renaissance art is immense. It was here, in the 1420s, that the young Masaccio took over from the older, conventional Masolino, creating biblical frescoes of such vibrant physicality that, according to the 16th-century art historian Vasari, for the next hundred years Florences most famous artists studied the chapel as part of their training. Vasari also notes that one of their first devotees was a young friar living in the monastery when the chapel was painted and that until then Filippo Lippi was better known for defacing his study books with crudely drawn figures.Philip Kazan isnt the first novelist to be entranced by Lippis life. In his later years, the painters libidinous humor (Vasaris words) would have him elope with a novitiate nun who would become the mother of his children and the model for one of the sweetest, most human of Renaissance Madonnas. However, in The Painter of Souls, the first in a promised series, Lippi is still very young. With facts thin on the ground, Kazan has readily admitted to using a lavish amount of poetic license to make his story fly.As the title suggests, Kazans Lippi sees divinity in the humblest of Gods creatures. He starts life as a street urchin, a goose quill pen in one hand and gambling dice in the other. Since he is taken into a Carmelite monastery at the age of 8, much of the novels drama comes from the clash between the tranquillity of the cloisters and Lippis yearning for the world beyond. Kazan conjures up Florence as a magnificent stew of street life: market sellers, beggars, gangs, petty criminals, pretty boys turning tricks in the shadows, all characters who, in the hands of the right painter, might light up church walls with their spontaneous flawed humanity.Inside the monastery (equally richly evoked through an echoing soundscape) the story becomes more predictable. The young painter may have things to learn, but his talent is manifest from the beginning. When he returns from one of his many escapades with a portrait of a nursing mother roughly charcoaled on his white robes, everyone  including Masaccio  is soon hailing it as a wonder. After he paints an Annunciation on the wall of his mothers slum house (history, of course, offers no record of either event) he finds the place filled with admirers, including Donatello and Cosimo de Medici. Florence in the 1420s was filled with men who would become historys superstars, but for that very reason the novelist must be circumspect in how he uses them, and there are moments when The Painter of Souls edges into Hollywood biopic territory.In contrast, the process of creation is finely drawn, both the physical labor  the grinding of the pigments, the scraping of the palette knife, the boiling of the glue  and the meditative concentration it induces. Kazan clearly loves Lippis work and this affection saturates his writing. The description of an image of St. Albert as a skinned hare in Carmelite robes takes you into the painters mind as well as the saints body.The book ends with Lippi poised for greatness. In a final, immensely cheeky fictional flourish, Kazan has him muscle in on the most famous fresco in the Brancacci Chapel, Masaccios revolutionary portrait of Adam and Eve, broken and racked with shame as theyre ejected from Paradise. Having completed Eves face (a silent scream that will not be rivaled until Edvard Munch) Masaccio leaves Adam for Lippi to finish. After studying the fresco again in Florence recently, I didnt believe a word of it, though I couldnt help admiring Kazans chutzpah. If the novel sends readers back to the original fresco, then the artistic heresy might be worth the wrath it will bring down on him from the art historians."}
{"text": "Sometimes rowdy parades, random eruptions of jazz and traffic jams involving cross-dressing belles on the way to a Krewe ball are just what a family vacation calls for. It is this unapologetic sass, in fact, that makes children fall head over heels in love with New Orleans.Once they see rainbow-colored houses and adults sporting what looks like Halloween apparel (even outside of Mardi Gras season) without anyone so much as offering a querulous double take, they understand that this is no slog-through-museums type of trip. In fact, no need to enter a museum at all.Though the city has many outstanding institutions, the best interaction with Nolas curious brew of culture happens right in the street. Its promenading past the historic homes of the Garden District. Weaving through the career buskers in Jackson Square. Locating  and dancing to  a brass band performance on Frenchmen Street after dark. Each neighborhood has a flavor, and exploring the various pockets, gritty, glam and everything in between, is the main event.New Orleanss reputation as the ultimate American party town is part of its charm, even to families with young children. But not in a knock-back-shots-on-Bourbon-Street kind of way. Its the mood. The quirky mash-up of cultures  French, Spanish, Caribbean and American South  lends an exuberance to the tourist experience. Its also an excellent jumping-off point for teaching moments. While children are spellbound by beignets and bowling to live swamp pop, a Creole/Cajun/rockabilly musical genre unique to Louisiana, parents can stealthily work in discourse on colonialism and position Nouvelle Orleans as a microcosm of the melting pot called America.Here, an itinerary that melds street culture, history, art, food and entertainment.The heart of New Orleans is the Vieux Carr, also known as the French Quarter.Kick off the day at Caf du Monde, the landmark coffee shop that has been serving up sugar-dusted beignets since 1862. Though a tourist magnet, the beignet symbolizes the citys French roots. You wont be disappointed. Then, cross the street and hit Jackson Square, an open-air artist colony teeming with street performers. This is the moment that children notice that New Orleans is a different kind of city. Sure, the colorful Creole architecture registers. But its the kooky Mary Poppins meets Pirates of the Caribbean vibe, a dreamscape of jugglers, artists, musicians and magicians, that makes them prick up their ears with delight.Take in the scene (family portraits are a fun souvenir) and then get ready for a 30-minute tour through the cobblestone streets of the French Quarter. If a fact-filled wander about town sounds like pure punishment, think again. For children, learning about the past can be fascinating, if the setting is right. Taking in the sights from a carriage is decidedly cool. So is picking out the mule leading your expedition.Then there is the delivery. The drivers of Royal Carriages are veterans at winning over a pint-size audience. Their secret? Cast history as fairy tale with politicians, European monarchs, jazz greats and voodoo masters as heroes and villains. For families with older children, there are French Quarter tours (many are free) to suit every fancy: walking, Segway, bicycle, food and even voodoo themed.Suddenly, its lunchtime. Gather the troops and head over to Johnnys Po Boy to score the requisite foodstuffs for a picnic. Exceptionally tasty sub sandwiches, poboys, are to New Orleans what hot dogs are to Chicago. Encourage the brood to live like locals and eschew the comfort of chicken parm in favor of a sandwich laden with crawfish, catfish or oysters. Plop down on the riverbank and enjoy a leisurely meal in front of the mighty Mississippi.The Garden District, a glamorous 19th-century neighborhood famous for white colonnaded mansions, makes for great sightseeing. Make transportation part of the adventure. For $1.25 a ride, the St. Charles streetcar line (the oldest continuously operating streetcar system in the world) will provide an inexpensive brush with history as it ferries you across town to Washington Avenue. There are many D.I.Y. tours spotlighting the spectacular architecture of this area. Do an abridged version, peppering the walk with queries that have the children visualizing what life was like for the inhabitants of these stately homes.Then, meander through Lafayette Cemetery No. 1, one of New Orleanss oldest Cities of the Dead. Though creepy, the mazes of aboveground tombs are hauntingly beautiful, a testament to the citys unique landscape. Children are obsessed with zombies. Once they learn that this macabre site was the setting for the WB hit show The Originals and Anne Rices vampire series (there are fictional graves for the Mayfair Witches and Lestat in Ms. Rices popular novels), they will be eager to examine the sun-bleached headstones and voodoo coins left in exchange for favors.In a city whose motto is laissez les bons temps rouler, it is not surprising that there are more good times to be had after dark. Case in point: Rock N Bowl. Unlike the average 10-lane space blasting 70s rock from a jukebox, this New Orleans institution is a top venue for live music. And when the band begins, the dance floor fills with lively two-steppers (children are welcome) hoofing it to whatever the nightly lineup brings: zydeco, funk, blues, swing, swamp pop. Arrive at 7 p.m. for bowling; music begins at 8:30 during the week; Sundays at 5:30 p.m. The St. Charles streetcar will get you there cheaply and efficiently.Experiencing the bustle of Frenchmen Street when the sun goes down is essential. Again, transit is part of the fun. Pick up a pedicab (they are in tourist hubs or can be easily ordered; 504-891-3441) and make your way over to the Faubourg Marigny district, wooting freely with your clan and passers-by as you encounter costumed partygoers and second line parades, the impromptu street celebrations featuring a sizable brass marching band.Take a lap around Frenchmen Art Market to check out local art and crafts. Then follow the music. After 8 p.m., it is commonplace to find clusters of folks dancing to a jazz happening in the street. Most of the dozen venues in this area do not allow children, but Three Muses is an exception. If you reserve a table (walk-ins are permitted but space is limited) and order some small plates, a truly authentic New Orleans evening awaits. Another option for music is Preservation Hall, a child-friendly jazz venue in the French Quarter where patrons of all ages take in old-school jazz from rough-hewed wooden benches.When in New Orleans, put all healthy food edicts on hold. To get a sense of place, it is imperative to gorge on all things fried and creamy.At District, comfort food gets a dose of Southern zip: biscuits infused with praline bacon and egg. Brled cinnamon rolls. Croquenuts, a Croque Madame hybrid featuring a griddle doughnut filled with havarti cheese, bchamel sauce and an egg.Dat Dogs rendition (three locations) of the old-school hot dog takes street food to decadent heights. Crawfish, duck and smoked andouille sausages (there are also vegetarian and fish dog options) are smothered in homemade fixings like Creole mustard and sweet relish. Traditional beef wieners are available for those with a tamer palate. A side of crawfish touffe fries adds local flavor.For a sugary pick-me-up, Sucrs (three locations) Parisian-style pastries, chocolate truffles and macarons inspired by the flavors of New Orleans will satisfy munchkins and parents alike.The funky, folk-art-infused ambience of Jacques-Imos Cafe  is reason enough to hit this renowned Uptown restaurant. But the satisfying mlange of Nawlins grub  fried grits, Creole jambalaya, stuffed quail, blackened redfish with crab chile hollandaise, smothered chicken with biscuits  is, quite simply, the stuff of Southern foodie fantasies. Go for dinner before Rock N Bowl. For a splurge, book the Haute Creole jazz brunch at Commanders Palace.To combine chill-out time with an afternoon activity, head to the Toulouse Street Wharf in the French Quarter for a two-hour jazz cruise aboard the Steamboat Natchez. Children will love peeking into the engine room and learning about the steam-powered stern-wheeler, one of the few still in operation, while parents will enjoy listening to the live music.En route to your hotel, let the kids burn off the remainder of their sugar intake on the slides and jungle gyms at Cabrini Playground, a sweet green space conveniently tucked into the French Quarter.New Orleans has a wide range of hotels and well-priced bed-and-breakfasts. Staying in or near the French Quarter is both fun and efficient. It offers easy access (by foot, pedicab or streetcar) to all activities and restaurants noted. And it includes a front-row seat to New Orleanss lively street life. Three choices: Maison Dupuy,  Le Pavillon and Windsor Court Hotel.If you have the time to travel outside the metro area, consider a trip to the bayou. Cajun Encounters will pick you up at your hotel and shuttle you to the swamp, where you will traverse brackish channels by boat in search of snakes, alligators and wild boars. Visiting Louisianas famed antebellum mansions is another standout day trip. The opulence of the grounds and big houses speak to the wealth of the sugar cane heyday. At the same time, preserved (or often reconstructed) slave quarters illuminate one of the grimmer moments in American history."}
{"text": "Although the restaurant is open, the blinds are barely turned, the gold-seamed curtains drawn. Its been like this since 2008, when Aissata Kaba, a native of Guinea, took over this corner storefront across from an overgrown lot in the South Bronx that is still waiting for the city to make it a park.But now the windows are framed in winking neon ellipses. The dusty burgundy awning has given way to three-dimensional letters glowing over bands of flame. The restaurant, once called Bat, after the region in Upper Guinea where Ms. Kaba grew up, has been reborn as Nabaya, loosely translated on the menu as where everyone is welcome. (Both names appear on the sign outside.)According to Emily Lynn Osborn, an associate professor of African history at the University of Chicago, nabaya was a policy established in Bat in the 18th century to draw settlers with the promise of land and arranged marriages. Here the enticements are photographs of food, posted in the windows and bearing only a faint resemblance (ignore the eerily symmetrical cheeseburger) to what is found within.For years, Ms. Kaba cooked breakfast at Sylvias in Harlem and catered from her home, often cooking for the local mosque. Her menu here is best understood as a wish list; on my visits, only a few dishes were ever available.By day, there may be a Guinean stew of sweet potato leaves, nutrient-dense and mellow, more buttery than biting and, once cooked down in a rich bath of palm oil, akin to spinach minus the bitter aftermath. The brine comes from smoked fish and crawfish powder, the fervor from Scotch bonnets. And the lusciousness: thats cows foot, hidden in the depths, swiftly approaching jelly.From Ivory Coast, where Ms. Kabas mother and one of her fellow cooks were born, comes sauce claire, which is heavier than its name suggests, made of fresh tomatoes collapsed into a dark near-soup. Traditionally, it is thickened with small round African eggplants, but Ms. Kaba follows a different recipe, relying on garlic, onions and the slow drift of time. I had it once with long trunks of carrots and a broken fish still threaded with bones, and later with a half-submerged archipelago of beef, whose leaching fat made the broth thicker and stronger.Larger, more single-minded plates of meat are saved for dinner. All are excellent: lamb shank ready to shear off the bone; guinea hen with skin just shy of wholly blackened, needled with Scotch bonnets; a whole tilapia mobbed with ginger; chicken slapped with spices until it turns the color of sunset. Never mind the repetition in sauces, with both lamb and guinea hen anointed in onions alchemized with mustard, a version of yassa from Senegal (home to another of Ms. Kabas cooks).Be warned: The secret ingredient in almost every dish is Maggi chicken bouillon powder. (This is used in West Africa, too, as a substitute for more difficult-to-find ingredients like fermented locust-bean seeds.) Maggi also shows up unmasked at the corner of a heap of attik, cassava that has been fermented, grated and steamed. It looks like couscous and has almost no taste at all, which may explain the presence of Maggi, along with a handful of minced chile that I realized, belatedly, was raw Scotch bonnet.Less traumatic condiments include a sauce simply called pepper, a small eruption of Scotch bonnets tempered with palm oil, smoked fish and crawfish powder. But only the staunchly bland sides  daunting mounds of rice, couscous and truncated strands of vermicelli  need adjusting.From Yankee Stadium, Nabaya is a 15-minute walk, a straight run down hustling 161st Street. A century ago this was a German neighborhood; the two-story building where Nabaya stands once housed ladies tailors. Ms. Kaba arrived in 1991, part of the first wave of West African immigrants, many of whom settled in Morrisania, a few blocks north.While the facade has been rechristened in neon, the dining room remains drowsy, with a few booths and tables clad in gold brocade under plastic covers. The television may be tuned to Nigerian rap videos or Fox News, depending on the hour and the state of mind of the presiding waitress.She may be as baffled by the menu as you are, with its promise of bagels (there are none) and, for $5, extras.Oh, extras, she finally said. Thats extra of anything."}

{"text": "MAKING MONTE CARLOA History of Speculation and SpectacleBy Mark Braude289 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27.Monaco likes to date its birth as a sovereign principality to the seizure of a local fortress by one Francesco Grimaldi on the night of Jan. 8, 1297, but its mutation into an enclave of wealth and privilege was far less heroic: It was a wily Frenchman  and former cardsharp  who understood that by giving gambling an aura of class, royalty, millionaires and any number of fools could be persuaded to part with their money.From the moment Franois Blanc arrived in the rundown Mediterranean city-state in 1863, he set about building a palatial neo-Baroque casino and an equally elegant Hotel de Paris. And to give some kudos to the rocky oceanfront outside the old town that was chosen for development, he named it after the Grimaldi ruler of the day, Prince Charles III  or Carlo in the local dialect. With a turn of the wheel, he invented Monte Carlo.Making Monte Carlo, an anecdotal story of how it came about by Mark Braude, a lecturer in history at Stanford, ends rather abruptly in 1930, thus denying us the glamour of Prince Rainiers marriage to Grace Kelly in 1956, her tragic death in 1982 and the reams of salacious gossip provided by their daughters, Caroline and Stphanie, and their son, now ruling the place as Prince AlbertII. But it is evident that the business model created by Blanc 150 years ago has stood Monaco in good stead.Blanc knew what he was doing because he had done it before. After speculating with stocks and playing the tables across Europe, he and his brother, Louis, set up shop in the German spa of Bad Homburg in 1840. In no time, the town was booming, with the new railroad system bringing gamblers  Dostoyevsky was among the losers  from across Europe. For appearance sake, they were taking the waters, but the main attraction was roulette.It was no small coup, therefore, when Franois Blanc  by then, his brother had died  was persuaded to apply his formula to Monaco. To do so, he acquired a struggling new company, Socit Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des trangers  Monaco (the Company of Sea Bathing and Circle of Foreigners in Monaco), known simply as S.B.M. But with this mouthful of a name came an exclusive 50-year concession to run games of chance.In practice, S.B.M. also took over running the 499-acre principality, providing successive princes with most of their income along with supplying water and gas to the locals, paving Monacos roads, linking the principality by sea to Nice and eventually building its railroad stations. Change came quickly. In 1869, Monaco received nearly 200,000 visitors. That same year, Prince Charles abolished income tax for its residents (which explains why, to this day, Monaco is home to the likes of high-earning tennis stars, Formula One drivers and pop stars).Blanc, who died in 1877, in turn created a dynasty of his own, with S.B.M. run successively by his widow and son. As ever, success lay in marketing an illusion of exclusivity: In the near presence of European monarchs, American millionaires and famous actresses (Sarah Bernhardt performed at the opening of the Monte Carlo Opera in 1879), the middle classes were inveigled to dress, behave and spend above their rank.Before entering, ones outfit first had to pass inspection by the large unsmiling men dressed in blue-and-red uniforms, capped in gold braid, who flanked the buildings heavy doors, and came to be known as the dress police, Braude writes. Those who won approval then entered a world of luxury. The opulent dcor hinted at the kind of freedom that could be bought with the wealth that waited at the tables.Karl Marx, in Monaco on doctors orders in 1882, saw through the glitter. Writing to his daughter, he drew a parallel with the mythical principality in Offenbachs opra bouffe La Grande-Duchesse de Grolstein. The economic basis of Monaco-Grolstein is the gambling casino, he noted. If it should close up tomorrow, Monaco-Grolstein would go into the grave  all of it! But it didnt.It did, however, have its regular scandals. A bomb exploded in the casino in 1880 and a grenade in 1930, although normality was quickly restored. The sensationalist press also lapped up stories of suicides following catastrophic losses at the tables. Death in Monte Carlo was shown as the logical punishment for leaving home, for succumbing to Mammon, for living life at too fast a pace, Braude notes.And of course no evening was complete without elegantly attired prostitutes and courtesans working the gaming rooms. Theodore Dreiser seemed fascinated by these evil, rather glorious and showy spiders spinning nets for none too satisfactory men. Braude himself adds: Prostitutes were regarded as the ultimate arrivistes, callous social climbers.With Monaco reaching the height of its vacuous glory in the 1920s, it was the American publicist Elsa Maxwell who turned a winter resort into a year-round playground. And the Monaco Grand Prix, first held in 1929, became a lasting attraction, one that, as always, gathered the rich and famous around its latest edition on May 29. Clearly, when it comes to Monte Carlo, there is never no more bets."}
{"text": "What is the point, really, of historical comparison? How do you measure a basketball mutation, which is what the Golden State Warriors have become, with their long-distance dialing that makes comparing them with storied N.B.A. teams of yore like distinguishing between a smartphone and a land line?You watched Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson dishearten and finally defeat a resolute Oklahoma City team on Monday night in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. You watched them make 3-point shots over the outstretched arms of men much taller, and you found yourself saying the unbelievable, ridiculous, stupefied words you mouth when you cant quite believe what youre seeing.It is practically a reinvented game these so-called Splash Brothers are playing, having drastically extended the standard scoring range, the acceptable area from which to consistently unload and succeed.After the Warriors had finally moved on to an N.B.A. finals rematch with LeBron James and his Cleveland Cavaliers with a 96-88 victory over the Thunder, someone asked the hard-to-impress Russell Westbrook what Curry had showed him late in the series that was missing earlier.Westbrook said, impassively: Our bigs on the switches came out, and he made some tough shots over the top of them.Westbrook should have added that there was nothing negligent, or lazy, about the Thunders defensive resolve in Game 7. The high screens forced Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka to the perimeter time and again to cover Curry or Thompson.Adams is a 7-footer, weighing 255 pounds; Ibaka is listed at 6-10, 245. Big men are typically at a disadvantage in isolation against smaller, more creative players, but Adams and Ibaka are earnest, athletic defenders who contested and occasionally deflected a Curry or Thompson launch earlier in the series.Is it easy shooting over an aggressive, skyscraping wingspan, pump-faking, sidestepping, creating just enough space to release with dead-on accuracy from that far away? Try it sometime. See how it goes.Curry hit seven 3-pointers in Game 7. Thompson, coming off a single-game playoff record of 11 3s (on 18 attempts) in the crucial Game 6 in Oklahoma City, nailed six. In the fourth quarter, they were daggers to the heart of a team more than holding its own from inside the 3-point line.Curry and Thompson each surpassed the previous individual high of 28 3-pointers (held by Ray Allen and Dennis Scott) made in a single N.B.A. playoff series, Curry with 32, Thompson with 30.Amid it all, Bill Simmons posted on Twitter that 30 years ago, in the 1986 finals, Boston and Houston combined to hit 17 3-point shots in an entire six-game series won by the Celtics.Those familiar with Simmons, late of ESPN and now with HBO, will know that he is an unapologetic Celtics fan. And that Boston team, anchored by Larry Bird, won 67 games in 1985-86, losing once at home, and certainly staked its claim as one of the greatest in N.B.A. history.Many of us who covered sports in that decade have argued that it was the N.B.A.s best blend of old-school fundamentals combined with the arrival of a new-age athleticism that would manifest itself in the 1990s marketing miracle that became Michael Jordan.The Lakers of the mid- to late 1980s  a team that included Mychal Thompson, Klays father  belong in any best-ever conversation, given the prime of Magic Johnsons career, the still-potent Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Hall of Fame gifts of James Worthy.But it was Jordans Chicago Bulls team of 1995-96 that won 72 games and the fourth of six championships in eight seasons that these 73-victory Warriors are running a mythical race against. Make no mistake: A generation of Jordan worshipers was poised to gloat had the Thunder been able to close out the Warriors. It will be again if James can deliver a championship to Cleveland.For all their titles, perhaps the true appraisal of the Jordan-era Bulls came in the 1993-94 season, when Jordan walked away to flail at minor league breaking balls. Scottie Pippen and a cast unintentionally derided as supporting won 55 games. They proved to be much more than a backup band, the Jordanaires, when they came within one highly questionable foul call on Pippen of going home with a chance to finish off the Knicks and advance to the Eastern Conference finals.But what they lacked without Jordan was another closer, or coldblooded scorer, to achieve what Thompson did when he dropped 41 points on the Thunder in Game 6.A year ago, on the Warriors way to the franchises first title since 1975, all four of their opponents dealt with manpower shortages.This time around, they had to push on in the first two rounds against Houston and Portland without the injured Curry, the leagues two-time most valuable player.Against the Thunder, the Warriors had to deal with Draymond Green slumping and flirting with suspension while they fell into a three-games-to-one hole. With the confidence of Westbrook and Kevin Durant soaring, with Curry struggling to reclaim his rhythm, the Warriors still rallied for three straight victories against a long and talented team that had taken out the 67-win San Antonio Spurs.Now the Warriors reward is James, a two-time champion with Miami and an N.B.A. finalist for the sixth straight season, and a Cavaliers team at full strength.I think any time you go through a long postseason, you grow, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. Now that weve been through this together for two years, going deep in the playoffs, I guess we played 21, 22 playoff games last year, and now were at 16, maybe 17. I havent really kept track, but thats a lot of playoff games. Thats a lot of pressure, a lot of circumstances that come your way.And that may be our truest basis for comparing teams from different eras, rules and styles: What and whom must a champion endure and overcome?The Warriors made 73 wins look almost too easy, tempting those commonly referred to as haters to question or deride the quality of the competition, in the interests of historical context.Forget all that now. Extreme playoff adversity has been met and surmounted, and here comes LeBron. This Warriors title defense has taken on a degree of difficulty as formidable as the nightly audacity of their 3-point marksmen.If Curry and Thompson continue making them, even the haters may have to mimic Joe Lacob, the Warriors owner, who, upon spotting Thompson after Game 6, went down on one knee and bowed."}
{"text": "LONDON  The Polish government said on Tuesday that it would revive an effort to extradite the filmmaker Roman Polanski, whom the American authorities have wanted for decades. He pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl but fled to Europe the next year, on the eve of his sentencing.The  announcement is the latest twist in a long-running legal battle that, at least in Poland, seemed to have ended.On Oct. 30, a judge in Krakow, Poland, ruled that turning over Mr. Polanski would be an obviously unlawful deprivation of liberty and that the state of California was unlikely to provide humane conditions of confinement for the filmmaker, who is 82. The next month, the Krakow prosecutors office said it would abide by the judges ruling.But in a statement on Tuesday, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who is also Polands chief prosecutor, said he had decided to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, calling the trial judges decision a serious breach of the extradition agreement between the United States and Poland.Mr. Ziobro did not cite the judge, Dariusz Mazur, by name, but he said the judge had assessed the gathered evidence in a biased and selective way. Mr. Ziobro added that the time limit for prosecuting Mr. Polanski in the United States had not passed.The justice minister also said he disagreed with the judges decision that Mr. Polanski had effectively already been punished. Mr. Polanski spent 42 days in jail before fleeing the United States in 1978, and he was held in Switzerland from 2009 to 2010, before the Swiss government declined to extradite him.The detention in Switzerland was a consequence of his escape abroad from American justice and avoiding criminal liability, not a punishment for a crime of which he is accused, the minister said.Mr. Ziobro said he also found incomprehensible the Krakow judges findings that Mr. Polanski would face inhumane or degrading treatment if extradited to the United States.In an interview with Polish state radio, Mr. Ziobro suggested that Mr. Polanski had escaped justice because of his fame. If he was just a regular guy, a teacher, doctor, plumber, decorator, then Im sure hed have been deported from any country to the U.S. a long time ago, Reuters quoted him as saying.The immediate implications for the filmmaker, an Oscar-winning director famous for films including Chinatown and Rosemarys Baby, were not clear. Mr. Polanski, a Holocaust survivor, is a dual citizen of his native France, his primary country of residence, and of Poland, where he grew up.Mr. Polanski, who has a home in Krakow, has been working on a film in Poland about Alfred Dreyfus, a French Army captain who was wrongly convicted of spying for Germany in 1894. Last week, Mr. Polanski appeared at a news conference in Katowice, Poland, with the French composer Alexandre Desplat, who has written the scores for several of Mr. Polanskis films.Jan Olszewski, a lawyer for Mr. Polanski, told the Polish television network TVN24 that the announcement was not a surprise. We had been expecting the minister to do it, he said.We are not pondering here the question of whether Polanski is guilty or not  the judge was very clear in this regard, he added. We are discussing whether Roman Polanski can be extradited. These are two different things.Several institutional and political changes have occurred in Poland since the Krakow courts ruling. In November, a government led by the right-wing Law and Justice Party, which swept  parliamentary elections, took office.The party has moved Poland to the right and taken steps to curb judicial and news media independence, alarming European Union leaders, who say the shift might violate the democratic norms of the 28-nation bloc.The party is known for its law-and-order approach, and for its appeal to Roman Catholic and nationalist voters.Mr. Ziobro, who became justice minister in November, has consolidated power, and regional prosecutors like the one in Krakow now report to him.In his statement, Mr. Ziobro suggested that his decision was not politically motivated. He noted that his predecessor as chief prosecutor, Andrzej Seremet, requested a review of the Krakow courts ruling in December, with an eye toward a possible appeal.Mr. Polanski was arrested in 1977 on charges that included the rape of a teenage girl at the home of the actor Jack Nicholson. That August, he pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor under a deal that allowed him to avoid conviction on other, harsher charges, including sodomy and rape.He fled the United States the next year, after learning that the trial judge in California, Laurence J. Rittenband, had decided to revise a plan to limit his sentence to a 90-day psychiatric evaluation, a portion of which Mr. Polanski had already served in a state prison. (The judge, who died in 1993, once vowed to remain on the bench until Mr. Polanski returned.)In 2009, a California appeals court panel suggested that Mr. Polanski could be sentenced in absentia to time served, opening the way to a possible resolution of the standoff. But the plan was rejected by the Los Angeles County Superior Court.After the unsuccessful effort to have Mr. Polanski extradited from Switzerland, where he was arrested while at a film festival in Zurich, the United States Department of Justice asked Poland in December 2014 for help in extraditing Mr. Polanski.Mr. Ziobro, in his statement on Tuesday, took pains to recite the serious crimes for which Mr. Polanski was convicted, including sex with the 13-year-old, who was under the influence of alcohol and methaqualone, a sedative.In a 2013 memoir, the victim, Samantha Geimer, said she had forgiven Mr. Polanski and moved on with her life.During the court proceedings in Krakow, two of Mr. Polanskis defense lawyers, Mr. Olszewski and Jerzy Stachowicz, repeatedly cited the 2008 documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, which suggested prosecutorial overreach and judicial misconduct by American officials.They argued that extraditing Mr. Polanski would violate the European Convention on Human Rights and his right to a fair trial."}
{"text": "The Mets owners are expected to begin paying by Wednesday what they owe the trustee representing the victims of Bernard L. Madoff, the former stockbroker who pleaded guilty in 2009 to running a vast Ponzi scheme. The payments would settle a lawsuit filed against the teams owners by the trustee in 2010.The trustee also granted the owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, some financial relief by revising the settlement. The payment due on or before Wednesday was reduced from $23.3 million to $16 million, and the final payment of $45 million will be divided into four annual installments beginning in 2017.According to a statement by the trustee Irving H. Picard, Wilpon and Katz will pay an interest rate of 3.5 percent on the unpaid balance of the $45 million. Picard said the interest payments could add at least $2.2 million to repay Madoffs customers.Before the agreement was changed, Wilpon and Katz had been scheduled to pay $37.9 million by June 1, 2017.The trustees website showed that Katz and Wilpon asked to modify the settlement during the spring. No reason is cited for their request to change the payment schedule. Through a Mets spokesman, they declined to comment.Under the original five-year settlement, Wilpon and Katz owed a maximum of $162 million. But they were always likely to see that $162 million reduced through the trustees efforts to recover the $17.5 billion lost in Madoffs Ponzi scheme.To date, the recoveries have winnowed what they owe to $61 million, which is expected to be reduced further as more money is recovered."}
{"text": "MODERN LOVERSBy Emma Straub356 pp. Riverhead Books. $26.When do the wheels come off the wagon? In your 20s, after a short-lived stint in a rock band? In your 30s, after your kids have sucked the life out of you? In your 40s, after you acquire gray hair and a real estate license? How about when your almost-adult child starts having sex with your best friends almost-adult child? Or maybe its when you, nearing 50, find a guru? And the guru turns out to be a con artist?Sigh. Its all of the above in Emma Straubs witty third novel, Modern Lovers. Elizabeth and Andrew are a married couple in their late 40s living in Brooklyn, a few doors down from their former college band mate, Zoe, and her wife, Jane. Along with their college friend Lydia, their band, Kittys Mustache (a nod to Tolstoys heroine), first sang what later became a monster hit called Mistress of Myself, one of those anthemic, eternally meaningful songs whose lyrics people tattoo on their inner arms.Lydia died glamorously of a drug overdose at 27, leaving the remaining three band members to round the corner on hipster senescence without her. Theres a saying about beautiful women and champion athletes dying two deaths. To that, I might add this: To be once young and briefly famous and painfully of-the-moment and then morph into regular-people middle age is rather more insulting, as if your whole life is the worst Instagram fail.And this is where we find the novels 40-something friends, past millennial hipness and on into hot flashes. Zoe and Jane own a restaurant; their daughter, Ruby, is sullen, sexual and terribly chic. Their marriage has traveled into the chill zone of lesbian bed death. Meantime, Elizabeth, a rebellious rocker in college, has traded her guitar for a career selling real estate in Ditmas Park, in one of those enclaves where you brew your own kombucha or risk the neighbors disdain. Her husband, Andrew, an aimless trustafarian, perceives himself as a brave escapee from the limestone canyons of Park Avenue. In reality, hes a dilettante who meanders from career to career, working vaguely at a lifestyle magazine for Brooklyn fathers and seeking fulfillment through cinematography classes and carpentry. At one point, his guru  Dave, distinctive mainly for his large, shiny teeth  remarks on the artful imperfection of the shelf Andrew is fabricating: This is beautiful, man. Wabi-sabi, right? It is, in fact, not an example of wabi-sabi, the Japanese term for artful imperfection and decay. Its just sloppy woodwork.The teenage children begin an affair. Zoe and Janes restaurant burns down suspiciously. (But their marriage is simultaneously and magically rekindled, apparently, by a good Chinese meal.) Elizabeth, succumbing to the entreaties of a stealthy Hollywood producer, signs away her and Andrews rights to a movie in the works about the mythic Lydia. (The producer describes it as Ray meets Sid and Nancy minus the Sid, meets Coal Miners Daughter, only the coal miner is an orthopedic surgeon from Scarsdale.) Elizabeth learns that Andrew may have had sex with Lydia when they were all in college, a discovery that sends their marriage into some sort of cliff-of-divorce drama that I, as a married person in my 40s, married almost two decades, cant really fathom. Why the huge sense of betrayal? It wasnt last week, after all. Does anyone remember who anyone slept with in college? (And if we did, dont email me.)Perhaps these Brooklyn couples in their postmodern Peyton Place  one with nutritional yeast and cosmic trance nights and talk of ayahuasca retreats  are more sensitive than, say, most of the married couples in Tolstoy, Updike, Henry James, D.H. Lawrence or Jackie Collins. Or even, I would venture to say, Dr. Seuss.Modern Lovers hurries to tie up its loose ends, and the interwoven climaxes seem sludgy. The final chapter employs a lazy literary device, a series of announcements (a notice in the New York Times weddings section, trivia from one characters IMDB page, a prcis of a thesis proposal, postings from foodie websites) that would seem more at home in the closing credits of Animal House. (Bluto becomes a United States senator!) But up until then, Modern Lovers is a wise, sophisticated romp through the pampered middle-aged neuroses of urban softies."}
{"text": "THE TIME TRAVELERS HANDBOOK18 Experiences, From the Eruption of Vesuvius to WoodstockBy James Wyllie, Johnny Acton and David GoldblattIllustrated. 338 pp. Harper Design/HarperCollins Publishers. $21.99.Its possible to have a crush on a guidebook. Like that more famous fount of lovable nurturing  the cute teacher in a cardigan  guidebooks gently usher you into new, potentially life-altering experiences while somehow making you believe that the rice-producing regions of the Po River Valley are all about You, You, You.While The Time Travelers Handbook didnt quite instill in me such heights of affection, I nevertheless listened with unflagging attention and never missed a class. As its subtitle indicates, this jocular, fact-filled volume imagines what it would be like to witness or participate in various historical events, complete with tips on where to eat, what to wear, what the weather will be like, where to stay and how dire the bathroom situation will be. History repeats itself, the authors write. First time as tragedy, second time as vacation.Hindsight, of course, would be a huge boon to any traveler: Think of the thousands who, had they been informed of the overcrowding and heavy rains theyd meet at the Woodstock festival, might have more happily channeled their energies into attending a mellow Odetta concert or pressing wheat pods into clay. But hindsight both giveth and taketh  when the book has you go to the 235th Olympic Games in Greece, in A.D. 161, the authors helpfully tell you to enjoy the six-foot-tall sculpture of Nike before its removed to Constantinople in the fifth century and destroyed in a fire. But at the Rumble in the Jungle, the 1974 smackdown between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali, youre told you wont be allowed to bet, since you already know who jungle-rumbled better.James Wyllie, Johnny Acton and David Goldblatt are to be commended for the scrupulous attention they pay to toilets throughout the ages. Once you learn that, as a crew member of Captain Cooks first epic voyage (1768-71), your commode is simply a hole cut in a long plank extending out from the bow of the ship, you have fully apprehended the living, squirming truth behind a hoary, ossified clich. Travel: so broadening.Similarly, I loved seeing how ubiquitous mud was in these historical events. It reigned at Woodstock, of course. But it also oozed out at the 1520 meeting of Henry VIII and Francis I known as the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and at the Womens March on Versailles in 1789, where peasants threw it at the carriage transporting Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. During your Captain Cook voyage, you find that the canals in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, have become stagnant pools teeming with millions of mosquitoes and caked in foul-smelling mud littered with human waste and dead animals. (Though this breeding ground of dysentery will wipe out several of your shipmates, you will be slipped antimalarial medication by a company representative. Hindsight + authorial godliness= Who loves ya, baby?)Theres a very tasty kind of schadenfreude to be gained from imagining your time-traveling self enduring the rigors described in these pages. But whats missing is a strong authorial voice. I enjoyed the audacity of being told, while watching the young Beatles perform in a Hamburg club in 1961, to buy some of the appetite suppressant known as Preludin from the 62-year-old Toilettenfrau in the mens room to put me in sync with the performers. But such gonzo advice made me wish the books voice were more inimitable, more Lets Go or Cadogan than Fodors or Frommers.That said, Ive strapped on my time-traveler goggles. Scarf: securely fastened. And Ive filled my carry-on with nothing but Imodium and wellies."}
{"text": "This piece is one of many we are featuring this month that was conceived and written by members of our teenage Student Council.Have you ever heard of the concept of the six-word story? The most famous is this one, attributed to Ernest Hemingway:For sale: baby shoes, never worn.As you can see, it is possible to make six meager words paint a clear image and hint at a rich story.Do you think you can do it? If so, we invite you to take any recent news story  from the presidential race to the recent shooting of a gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo to anything else in The Times that interests you  and create a six-word story out of it.Want some inspiration?The Times has written about the six-word story in the past, and once even sponsored a Six-Word Momoirs Contest in which participants were challenged to explain your mother, someone elses mother or motherhood in general in just six words.  Here are a few of the ones they honored:More examples? Read some of Smith Magazines six-word memoirs by teenagers, over 347,960 of which have been received, according to the site. As they put it, Writing in Six Words is a simple, creative way to get to the essence of anything  from the breaking news of the day to your own life and the way you live it.Note that one key to writing excellent stories this way lies in choosing only words that are completely essential, and eliminating words that are not. Words like and and the are usually a waste of spaces that can be filled with more potent words. Punctuation is crucial as well: Notice that in the story attributed to Hemingway there is a colon, a comma and a period.

{"text": "David, you have to look out for me!I was 5 years old and had just walked my dad into a stairway. He wasnt hurt, but I remember his irritation. He was blind and I was his son and guide-in-training. Whenever we walked together for the next 34 years, I made sure his path was clear.My sister, Ellen, and I were raised by our parents, Harold and Gail Snider. They were born blind, and we were sighted. We were the perfect double pair, joined arm-in-arm in a mutual bond of love and caring for each other.Inside our Washington home, our family routine was nothing out of the ordinary: Mom and Dad cared care for us and laid down the rules, while we helped them. Mostly, we read stuff they couldnt see, like the mail or restaurant menus, or we described things like clothes and movie scenes.As a child, I was incredibly uncomfortable with the nonstop looks we received whenever we went outside. Everyone, everywhere, looked at my parents and me, all the time. I know that seeing two blind adults, with their long white canes, walking with their two sighted children is a statistically rare event in our society, but to me it felt awful to get unwanted attention.As much as I loved my parents, I just hated being stared at. I didnt want them to be unique. Of course my parents were unbothered because they couldnt see. But my dad gave me permission to stick out my tongue, which was rude, if it would help me vent some of my anger and frustration.One incident in elementary school changed how I saw Mom and Dad. One of my teachers had asked me who cooked in our home. I said that my mother did, and somehow I was reprimanded for lying. My parents were used to the routine insults and low expectations from sighted people, which they vigorously protested. Dad offered to do a presentation at my school about blind people and what their lives were really like.So there I was, sitting with 50 kids and my teacher, while my father demonstrated how blind people adjusted to their lack of eyesight by reading Braille books and magazines and using canes for independent travel. He discussed how blind people made their own meals, went to school, earned college degrees, competed for jobs and paid their bills. They enjoy regular pastimes that sighted people do, like music and card games, and they take care of their children and have a good life. By the time he was finished, Id never been prouder to have unique parents.As a teenager, my passion for documentary photography was so all-encompassing that I decided to attend college at the School of Visual Arts. I thought that my family would be a good subject, as I wasnt aware of any photo essays on a blind couple photographed by their son. Using my camera to distill Mom and Dads routines at home and at work, it became a series that showed the sighted what my dad had talked about to my class all those years ago.David Snider is a documentary photographer and the producer of The Photography Channel website.Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "ENCHANTED ISLANDSBy Allison Amend306 pp. Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $26.95.That my life will be of interest to readers I dare not assume, Frances Conway explains early on in this novel based (somewhat loosely) on the published memoirs of a survivalist and her husband. But it is an unusual one, and for that reason alone record should be made of it. Smart but not brilliant, plucky but not vivacious, Frances is born in 1882 to immigrant parents in Duluth, Minn.  a town she runs away from as a teenager, both goaded and accompanied by her damaged, alluring best friend, Rosalie. Set to move through the world together, the friends part after a scandalous sexual treason (hair braids are involved). Frances travels west in pursuit of professional satisfaction, where she rubs uncomfortably up against her solitude only to reunite with Rosalie decades later, outside a movie theater in San Francisco.If that doesnt sound to you like the first hundred pages of a novel purporting to be about a pair of married spies sent to the Galpagos Islands to monitor the behavior of potentially murderous Germans in the midst of Hitlers rise, Im not surprised. But Allison Amends Enchanted Islands isnt concerned with packing its protagonist off to face exotic hardships and emerge a freshly insightful woman. This isnt yet another novel about a woman finding herself in the wild; its an endearing chronicle of female friendship and evolution in the early 20th century.We first meet Frances and Rosalie as hobbled old women living out their final years at the same nursing home in the mid-1960s, bemoaning the gloppy food, giggling over a second-rate magic show and bickering over riding in the front seat on outings with Rosalies son. Sweetly bound to each other as companions, they have a relationship that feels more like a marriage than a friendship, with its daily irritations and unspoken gestures of intimacy. First we see them as young girls, and then as middle-aged women forced into different social strata by religion and wealth; still, their every movement circles back to the primacy of their friendship. When Frances and Rosalie arent together, its the other theyre thinking of, acting for, wondering about.All of which makes Frances real marriage, constructed by the military as a cover for her husbands spying, look even more like the dummy show it is. Tied to each other by the bonds of militaristic necessity, Frances and Ainslie Conway develop a sweet affection and a working friendship. But marriage isnt the life-sustaining partnership that Frances needs to thrive.And this is where Amend smartly plies the habitually underrecognized bonds of sisterhood. It isnt that Frances doesnt worry about marriage or sensuality or intimacy because she has Rosalie; its that Frances accepts their love as enough love. Spouse, sibling, these connections seem more tenuous than whatever emanation holds Rosalie and me together.Of course, Frances and Ainslies time in the Galpagos  milling grain with a cavewomans mortar and pestle, tiptoeing around their German counterparts encampment, deciphering the hints at what the Axis may be plotting, chasing an underwear-thieving donkey through the underbrush  is the experience around which the rest of the novel settles (and which the real-life Conway did not so much as hint at in her memoirs). And its here that Amend displays her talent for making solitary humans the most alluring animals among blue-footed boobies, great frigatebirds and the rest of Darwins magnificent crew. On an island bursting with natures most remarkable creatures, humanitys depthless capacity for loneliness crows most keenly."}
{"text": "It must have been tempting over the decades to give up. But over the last week, victims who have been relentless in the pursuit of justice for gross human rights abuses in Chad and South America rejoiced as their former oppressors were convicted in two landmark trials. The cases, which involved Cold War allies of the United States, should serve as a warning to todays despots and offer hope to the legion of victims of human rights abuses around the world who are still waiting for their day in court.In Senegal, a tribunal backed by the African Union on Monday sentenced Hissne Habr, a former president of Chad, to life in prison for war crimes. Victims who attended cheered and thrust their fists in the air to celebrate a 16-year legal fight to hold Mr. Habr accountable for mass killings, torture and rape. Mr. Habr, who ruled Chad for eight years, sought refuge in Senegal after a coup in 1990. Washington had backed him because the nations had a common enemy in Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.In a world scarred by a constant stream of atrocities, the ramifications of this verdict are global, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, said in a statement.Meanwhile, a court in Buenos Aires on Friday convicted 15 former military officers for their roles in Operation Condor, an international crackdown by allied right-wing dictators that led to the killing and forced disappearance of hundreds of opponents and government critics. Reynaldo Bignone, 88, a former general who ruled Argentina from 1982 to 1983, was among those convicted. His 20-year sentence was largely symbolic because he is already imprisoned for other crimes, including the abduction of babies during the years of military rule.Operation Condor allowed paramilitary squads from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay to track dissidents across borders, and intelligence officers used an American telex system based in Panama to communicate. That fact and others disclosed in newly declassified American documents were revealed in the trial, shedding light on Washingtons complicity in the abuses.Secretary of State John Kerry applauded Mr. Habrs conviction and said it was an opportunity to reflect on, and learn from, our connection with past events in Chad. There was no statement about the case in Argentina.Mr. Habrs conviction in an African courtroom, by African jurists, was a milestone in the effort to bring authoritarian leaders from the continent to justice. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan and other African leaders have been critical of prosecutions outside the continent and have accused the International Criminal Court, which has  secured only two convictions in 13 years, of targeting mainly African leaders.The Chad and Argentina cases should be a warning to Mr. Bashir, who in 2009 became the first sitting head of state to be indicted by the International Criminal Court, but he has managed to remain in power. They should also resonate with an increasingly despotic leader Washington supports and arms: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. While it often takes decades and seismic geopolitical changes, determined victims can succeed in jailing the men who once assumed they could kill and jail citizens arbitrarily with impunity."}

Ministers from OPEC nations will meet in Vienna this week.David Schiegoleit, managing director of investments for the private client reserve at U.S. Bank, said he thought oil wouldnt go much higher unless the global economy improved or major nations started spending more.

The Commerce Departments data showed spending rose 1 percent in April as purchases of cars and other long-lasting goods increased. Wages and salaries, the most important component of incomes, gained 0.5 percent. That suggests the U.S. economy could pick up in the second quarter after six months of sluggish growth.Tempering that report, economists at the Conference Board said consumer confidence fell for the second month in a row and reached its lowest level since November. The board said consumers were feeling cautious about business and job market conditions.Companies that make household goods like food, drinks, cleaners and other everyday items slipped. Beer and winemaker Constellation Brands lost $4.68, or 3 percent, to $153.15 and Clorox gave up $1.16 to $128.54.Despite the mixed data, Erik Davidson, the chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said Americans were slowly getting over the shocks of the financial crisis and Great Recession.Theres probably never been a better time to be a consumer than right now, Mr. Davidson said. He noted that the job market remains solid, wages are inching higher and a strong dollar is making goods produced overseas less expensive.Westar Energy, biggest utility company in Kansas, surged after Great Plains Energy agreed to buy it for $8.5 billion, or $60 per share in cash and stock. The deal will give Great Plains a total of 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. Westar climbed $3.41, or 6.4 percent, to $56.33 and Great Plains Energy slid $1.82, or 5.9 percent, to $29.18.Boeing slumped after the U.S. Air Force announced new delays for the companys KC-46 Pegasus Tanker, a midair refueling plane. Boeing lost $3.07, or 2.5 percent, to $126.15.Jazz Pharmaceuticals said it would buy cancer drug developer Celator Pharmaceuticals for $30.25 per share, or $1.28 billion. Celators most advanced drug is Vyxeos, a potential treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Jazz also makes cancer drugs but gets most of its revenue from Xyrem, a drug used to treat side effects of narcolepsy. Celator soared $12.55, or 71.6 percent, to $30.08 and Jazz stock lost 53 cents to $151.56.Germanys DAX fell 0.7 percent, while Frances CAC 40 slipped 0.5 percent.

But in the 1970s, certain countries started to illegally occupy some islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands.Negotiation between states directly concerned is the only way to resolve the disputes. China has already signed border treaties through peaceful negotiations with 12 out of 14 land neighbors. The same practice should be adopted in the South China Sea.While pursuing diplomatic resolution, China is exercising restraint. The construction activities on the islands and reefs are all for peaceful purposes and do not affect in any way freedom of navigation and overflight.By not accepting or participating in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines, China is acting in accordance with international law.Regarding the incident raised in the editorial, our information indicates that Chinese military aircraft followed from a safe distance and monitored the American plane carrying out close reconnaissance in Chinese coastal waters. Our operation was completely compliant with safety and professional standards. The attempt at intimidation by American military aircraft in the South China Sea, however, was not.The South China Sea should not be turned into a geopolitical chessboard.

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Three years after Michael S. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake took Dell Inc. private, a Delaware judge has decided that the $24 billion deal was 21 percent too cheap.That said, most investors who held shares in the computer company at the time of the takeover will not be able to collect, owing to the intricacies of Delaware corporate law.In an opinion published on Tuesday, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery found that Dell shares were worth about $17.62 at the time of the 2013 leveraged buyout, rather than the $13.75 that Mr. Dell and Silver Lake paid.The court filing caps a lawsuit brought by a number of Dell investors who argued that they had been shortchanged by Mr. Dell, the founder of the company, which is incorporated in Delaware. Those shareholders brought what is known as an appraisal suit, calling on the Chancery Court to determine the fair value of their holdings at the time.A number of investors, including Carl C. Icahn, publicly protested the deal. Mr. Icahn proposed several takeover offers and threatened to scuttle the agreement with Mr. Dell and Silver Lake. The pair eventually raised their bid by 10 cents a share, while the board agreed to ease the voting requirements needed to approve the deal.Yet one of the biggest proponents of the Delaware appraisal suit, the mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price, will not be able to collect. Vice Chancellor Travis disqualified the firms roughly 27 million shares because of a wrinkle in what he called the byzantine system in which shareholders voted on the deal.Though T. Rowe publicly declared that it was opposed to the leveraged buyout, it actually  and mistakenly, because of the complexities of modern shareholder systems  voted in favor of the transaction.To qualify for any compensation that a favorable appraisal can bring, shareholders must have voted against the deal in question.That leaves a small percentage of Dell shareholders eligible for any additional payout. Among them is the hedge fund Magnetar Capital. That group will receive the difference, plus interest.Spokesmen for Dell and Silver Lake declined to comment."}

Meg Whitman, the companys chief executive before the split and now the leader of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, is a former Republican nominee for governor in California. She has forcefully denounced Mr. Trump in the past, calling him a dishonest demagogue and condemning his statements on women, Muslims and others as repugnant.The African-American activist group Color of Change, which has been one of the leaders of the campaign to get companies to cut their donations to the convention, said it had received word from HP last week that it would not be making any cash donations to the Republican or Democratic conventions this year. A company spokeswoman confirmed the decision.HP Inc. joins Coca-Cola and Microsoft in deciding to either significantly curtail or eliminate its monetary support to the Republican convention.Coca-Cola has declined to match the $660,000 it gave for the 2012 Republican convention, donating only $75,000 for this year and indicating that it does not plan to provide more.Microsoft will provide only software and technical assistance to the Republicans event, while it plans to give that and monetary support to Democrats.Political conventions and the cities that host them rely tremendously on corporate donations to fund their expenses, which can exceed $100 million when security costs are included. But companies have been wary of committing to the Republican National Convention this year given Mr. Trumps provocative and offensive statements on women and minorities.A Color for Change spokesman, Rashad Robinson, said Tuesday that it planned to keep the pressure on companies that have not yet said whether they would fund the convention, which starts July 18."}
{"text": "Amid an uproar in Cincinnati after a gorilla was shot dead after dragging around a boy who had slipped into a zoo enclosure, the police said Tuesday that they were investigating the actions of the childs family in connection with the episode.The shooting Saturday by zoo workers of the teenage gorilla, Harambe, prompted a chorus of online criticism, vigils for the animal, complaints by animal rights activists and petitions blaming the boys mother. The episode was even raised at a news conference held Tuesday by Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.As video showing the boy and the huge gorilla continued to be played on television and online, officials raised the possibility on Tuesday of criminal charges. Julie Wilson, a spokeswoman with the Hamilton County prosecutors office, said the matter had been referred to the Cincinnati Police Department for investigation.At this point, everybody is just looking into it to see whats going on, she said. I cant tell you that anyone will be charged with anything.A police statement released later Tuesday said the department was investigating the actions of the parents/family that led up to the incident but was not focusing on the operation or safety of the Cincinnati Zoo, which is under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture.An animal rights group said on Tuesday that it had filed a negligence complaint against the zoo with the Department of Agriculture.Zoo officials at first reported the boys age as 4. The police statement said officials had verified that the boy was 3.Lt. Stephen Saunders, a spokesman for the Police Department, said officials would not immediately release the name of the family.The boy had slipped through the Gorilla World exhibits barrier while visiting the zoo with his mother and had fallen into a shallow moat on Saturday afternoon. Videos of the encounter posted to Twitter showed the silverback gorilla dragging him around like a toy, while a woman could be heard calling to the sobbing child: Mommy loves you! Im right here.After about 10 minutes, zoo workers shot and killed the animal. The boy, who was hurt but not severely, was taken to a hospital and released on Saturday night, zoo officials said.Thane Maynard, the zoos director, has forcefully rejected criticism of the decision to kill the gorilla instead of using a tranquilizer dart. He said at a news conference on Monday that the dart could have caused the animal, capable of crushing a coconut with his hands, to become even more agitated.We are all devastated that this tragic accident resulted in the death of a critically endangered gorilla, Mr. Maynard said.A statement from the boys family, released through a public relations company, said:We are so thankful to the Lord that our child is safe. He is home and doing just fine. We extend our heartfelt thanks for the quick action by the Cincinnati Zoo staff. We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla. We hope that you will respect our privacy at this time.The animal rights group Stop Animal Exploitation Now said the zoo had been cited twice recently for problems with its enclosures and facilities. In the negligence complaint it filed with the Department of Agriculture against the zoo, it called for the maximum federal penalty of $10,000 per infraction per animal, it said in a statement.The failure of the Cincinnati Zoo to adequately construct this enclosure to protect both the public and the animal held prisoner there is a clear and fatal violation of the Animal Welfare Act, the group said in its letter to the agriculture department.The zoo said in a statement after the killing that the boy had climbed through a public barrier at the exhibit. The two female gorillas in the exhibit were successfully recalled, but Harambe stayed in the yard with the child. The video showed the gorilla sometimes standing over the boy in what appeared to be a protective posture, but then darting through the shallow moat, dragging the child behind him.Mr. Maynard said the childs head had banged on concrete.The episode generated widespread reaction, with some people criticizing the zoo, others supporting the mother and online petitions accusing her of negligence. Animal rights supporters organized a vigil outside the zoo in remembrance of the gorilla.On Tuesday, the Jane Goodall Institute, based in Virginia, released an email that the world-renown primatologist sent to Mr. Maynard on Sunday, expressing sympathy for the devastating loss.I feel so sorry for you, having to try to defend something which you may well disapprove of, Dr. Goodalls email said. I tried to see exactly what was happening  it looked as though the gorilla was putting an arm around the child  like the female who rescued and returned the child from the Chicago exhibit.Anyway, whatever, it is a devastating loss to the zoo, and to the gorillas. How did the others react? Are they allowed to see, and express grief, which seems to be so important.Feeling for you.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked at a news conference how he felt about the killing of the gorilla. He said: I think its a very tough call. It was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla, the way he held that child, it was almost like a mother holding a baby. Looked so beautiful and calm, and there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous.I thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful, almost 500-pound gorilla, the way he dealt with that little boy, but it just takes one second, Mr. Trump continued.It just takes one little flick of his finger, and I will tell you they probably had no choice."}
{"text": "TSURUGA, Japan  Visiting Hiroshima last Friday, President Obama warned that overcoming the perils of global conflict and nuclear weapons will require a moral revolution sustained by the radical and necessary notion that we are part of a single human family. He omitted to mention that this notion has been the constitutional basis of Japans foreign policy since 1947. Future historians may conclude that Mr. Obamas visit to Hiroshima provided a spectacle to help remilitarize the worlds wealthiest, most populous pacifist country.Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abes election in 2012, the Obama administration has relied on Japan to help escalate Americas military presence in Asia. The Abe administration has expanded Japans commitment to maintaining U.S. bases, relaxed restrictions on bilateral arms trading, and negotiated a framework for joint operations that makes America responsible for maintaining a regional balance of power that protects Japanese interests.This restructuring of the U.S.-Japan alliance depends on the continued progress of Mr. Abes legacy project: removing language from Japans Constitution that forbids the use of force to settle international disputes. The Abe administration has been able to shed the prevailing interpretation of this article, widely understood to prohibit the international deployment of Japanese troops, but the language itself continues to restrict the scope of Japans military operations, including activities integral to the defense agreement Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama struck last year.Eliminating these restrictions is ostensibly in the interest of peace, because the alternative to a rearmed Japan is an unchecked  and nuclear-armed  China. But this assessment leaves no room for the possibility that Japans military, among the best equipped in the world, has exerted a moderating influence on the region precisely because the Constitution has protected it from misadventure.In supporting Mr. Abes effort to restore Japans ability to join and wage wars, Mr. Obama has chosen the wrong strategic partner. The next U.S. president will inherit an East Asia policy vulnerable to the uncertainties of Japans transition away from pacifism. Since 2012, Mr. Abes foreign policy decisions have harmed Japans relationships with its neighbors, including the U.S. ally South Korea. Several of his political appointees have proven scandal-prone in matters of diplomacy.And Japan might not accept Americas strategic dictates. Firm supporters of Mr. Abes agenda see their efforts as the casting off of the final remnants of the American occupation, so that Japan can reclaim its own superpower status. In the ideological terrain of contemporary Japanese politics, the accommodation of American interests is chiefly opportunistic, and the underlying motive is often retrograde nationalism. Mr. Abes push to revise the Constitution has coincided with cabinet-level attempts to renegotiate history: Whether so-called comfort women used by Japanese soldiers during World War II were sex slaves or if their work was a form of indentured servitude; and how many Chinese civilians died in the Nanking Massacre in 1937.For Japanese voters, these debates formed the political and social context of Mr. Obamas visit. Questions of war memory dominated press coverage. According to a 2015 survey by Pew Research, 56 percent of Americans believe the atomic bombings were necessary; 14 percent of Japanese agree. By delivering an appeal for disarmament in a nation whose pacifist Constitution his Asian pivot has helped to controvert, Mr. Obama has risked lending credibility to the dangerous notion beneath Abes rhetoric: that Japan can best retain its identity as a peace-loving culture by embracing the restoration of its martial role in international affairs.If it were the will of the Japanese electorate to adopt the Abe doctrine, then the question of how Mr. Obamas visit has contributed to its legitimization would be academic. But nearly none of Abes policies, including revision of the pacifist Constitution, poll well. He nonetheless enjoys reliably favorable approval ratings, attributed by the center-right media to his carefully-cultivated public persona and by the left to calculated manipulation of the national psyche.Mr. Abes attempts to claim Japans collective memory have been less than democratic. He has been at war with the press since he took office, and has been especially zealous about destabilizing the countrys foremost daily newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, chief antagonist of his most hawkish positions. He has responded to multiple Supreme Court decisions requiring reform of the nations broken electoral system with a plan calculated to delay changes for as long as possible, a manipulation intended to give him time to build an opposition-proof majority in Parliament, and to create the illusion of an overwhelming mandate to remove pacifist language from the Constitution.For Mr. Abe, Mr. Obamas visit also provided a distraction from an initial wave of policy failures related to his American pivot. Early attempts to expand Japans arms export business have produced tepid results; and in anticipation of rearmament, the branches of Japans military have engaged in a wasteful struggle for funding  U.S. arms dealers have responded by price- gouging the Japanese government.In Hiroshima, Mr. Obama praised the U.S.-Japan alliance, saying it has taught both countries to cherish peace. He did not reflect on the 69 years of Japanese pacifism that have kept Japan out of war while the United States has waged several. By neglecting them, in a speech that touched so many old wounds, Mr. Obama has advanced the politically fraught and historically unsupportable notion that Japan has been the victim of its painful past, not the beneficiary of its difficult lessons."}
{"text": "A FOUR-BEDROOM POSTMODERN HOUSE IN COLOGNE$1.85 MILLION (1.65 MILLION EUROS)The German architect Heinz Bienefeld designed this four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath house, which is in the residential neighborhood of Mngersdorf, in western Cologne. Built in 1981, the three-level brick house has sanded red-brick floors, floor-to-ceiling windows and a simple geometric design, which are all typical of Mr. Bienefelds work.The front door of the 3,337-square-foot house opens into a long rectangular entrance hall. A hallway runs to brick steps leading down to the main living area, which is framed by 13-foot-tall floor-to-ceiling glass windows with views of the garden. The central section of the house is designed around an atrium.The kitchen is off the hallway on the ground floor and has stone countertops and modern appliances. There is a separate delivery entrance for the kitchen. The dining room, across the main hallway from the kitchen, is open to the living room. Off the dining room is a round room lined with cushioned seats, with a fireplace and a glass chandelier.A brick staircase leads upstairs to the master bedroom, which has an en-suite bathroom and a dressing room. From the bedroom, glass doors lead to a circular balcony with views of the garden. Another bedroom upstairs is used as an office or library.In addition to a guest bedroom on the ground floor, there are two more bedrooms in the basement, which receives daylight through the glass walls surrounding the atrium. There is also a wine cellar in the basement, as well as a workshop and storage space.The overall property is about one-fifth of an acre, including the lawn and gardens in the backyard, which is surrounded by a brick wall. There is a garage big enough for three cars. The current owner  who is the original owner  installed a new heating system about seven years ago, said Tobias Schulze, the managing director of Cologne Sothebys International Realty, which is listing the property. The furniture is not included in the price, but some pieces may be available for sale, he said.Mngersdorf is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Cologne, Mr. Schulze said. The west of Cologne is very green, mostly large detached houses, close to the city forest, he said. Shopping, restaurants, schools and a subway stop are about a mile from the house. The center of the city is reachable in about 10 minutes by subway. The Cologne airport is about a 30-minute drive; the larger international airport in Dsseldorf is 45 minutes.MARKET OVERVIEWHomeownership in Germany is traditionally lower than in other European countries, which has kept sales volume and prices low. Only 53 percent of Germans own their homes, compared with an average of 70 percent in the rest of Europe, according to European Union data.But there has been a surge in home purchases in recent years, because of low interest rates on mortgages and the lack of returns on savings. The number of new mortgages issued in 2015 increased by 22 percent from a year earlier, according to the Deutsche Bundesbank.People would rather buy property than put money in the bank, said Brigitte Kunkel-Griffin, the owner of German Property Services, a real estate firm in the Rhine region.The supply of available homes is low, which has sent prices soaring, particularly in the big cities, as more people move from rural to urban areas. In Germanys largest cities  Berlin, Hamburg and Munich  prices have increased by 30 percent in the last five years, according to Bulwiengesa, a consulting firm.Not enough homes were built in Germany during the last decade, said Alexander Rychter, the director of VdW Rheinland Westfalen (Association of Housing Companies in Rhineland and Westphalia). Add to that an increasing interest of Germans to get into the cities and you get to the present situation, with very dynamic housing markets and prices that keep rising fast.In Cologne, Germanys fourth-largest city, prices in the most popular neighborhoods have risen by 30 percent to 35 percent in the last four years and now range from 465 euros to 650 euros, or $521 to $729, a square foot, Mr. Schulze said. Cologne is home to several large German corporations, including the airline Lufthansa and the media company RTL Television.WHO BUYS IN COLOGNECologne doesnt attract many international buyers, Mr. Schulze said. About 85 percent of his clients already live in Cologne or within 60 miles.South of Cologne, in the Rhine region, which is a popular vacation and second-home destination, international buyers are much more common, Ms. Kunkel-Griffin said. More than 50 percent of her clients are from English-speaking countries, primarily from Britain, the United States and Australia. Recently she has also seen an increase in buyers from the Middle East, who are looking for second homes and a stable investment. Many international buyers see German real estate as a relatively safe investment, compared with the stock market or property in other countries, Ms. Kunkel-Griffin says.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Germany. The process follows European Union standards, and there will be few surprises for international buyers, Mr. Schulze said.An impartial notary handles the bulk of the paperwork. Hiring a lawyer is recommended but not essential, agents said. Mortgages are available, but foreigners may be asked to pay 20 percent to 40 percent of the purchase price upfront, Ms. Kunkel-Griffin said.Property records are easily accessible, making it simple to track ownership and confirm the title, agents say.The acquisition of property is concluded as soon as the change of ownership is signed into the land charge register, Mr. Rychter said. Registers are transparent and well-organized, so that ownership is distinctly identifiable at all times.WEBSITESCologne tourism site:  cologne.deGerman tourism site: germany.travelLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYGerman; euro (1 euro = $1.12)TAXES AND FEESIn the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which includes Cologne, there is a property purchase tax of 6.5 percent of the sales price. The sellers agent and the buyers agent each typically receive a commission of 3 percent of the purchase price, plus value-added tax. Registration and notary fees may add another 1.5 percent to 2 percent to the purchase costs. Property taxes on this house will likely be about 5,000 euros, or $5,600, a year, Mr. Schulze said.CONTACTTobias Schulze, Cologne Sothebys International Realty, (011-49) 221 997 73 50; koeln-sothebysrealty.de/"}

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  A start-up that lets users bet free on real-time sports has secured a new round of financing  and gained some high-level backers.WinView, which lets users compete in games that run at the same time as sports games, said on Tuesday that it had raised $3.4 million. The new investments bring WinViews fund-raising efforts to date to $6.5 million.The start-up also said that it had named the two investors who led the round, Tom Rogers and Hank Ratner, as its co-chairmen. The two bring experience in the media industry to the company: Mr. Rogers is the chairman of TiVo and the former head of NBCs cable division; Mr. Ratner is the vice chairman of Cablevision and the former chief of the Madison Square Garden Company.What drew both men to the eight-year-old WinView, they said in an interview, was the potential of the company to serve as a new platform for advertising tied to live sports, drawing on the sort of second-screen phenomenon that is part of Twitters appeal.The basic idea of WinView is relatively simple: Users challenge each other on various aspects of a live game using the companys smartphone app, ranging from a father taking on his daughter during a quarter of an N.F.L. game to a group of friends setting up a league tournament.It is a system that the two men said has already taken hold in Europe, where such synchronized competitions have overtaken daily fantasy sports in popularity.Underpinning the company are what Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ratner said were 26 key patents that cover running an online competition at the same time as a game.Yet the business of running games tied to live sports raises the specter of daily fantasy sports businesses like DraftKings and FanDuel, which have faced sharp questioning over whether they constitute online gambling.Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ratner were quick to dismiss any comparisons, noting that WinView for now was free to play and would  at least initially  draw its revenue from advertising. (They conceded that in Europe, WinViews counterpart operates largely as a pay-to-play system.)And they added that the various competitions that could run on WinView require far less of the sometimes arcane details and knowledge that populate daily fantasy sites.This is free to play, Mr. Ratner said. This is a far broader audience than a fantasy sports audience. This is for anyone who wants to play.As part of the announcement, WinView said that it would officially open for business in the United States this fall, coinciding with the start of the professional football season.Both men said that they viewed the service as a way to tap into audiences that have grown to shun commercials  something that Mr. Rogers said he has long observed during his tenure at TiVo.Advertisers are having a hard time reaching millennials, Mr. Rogers said. This has created what we think is a huge advertising opportunity."}
{"text": "Sumner Redstones failure to quickly remove Philippe P. Dauman as chief executive of Viacom may have been a misstep, a symptom of a man who is struggling with the predicament of ill health.To understand why Mr. Redstone may be acting too slowly, it is probably worth reflecting on what he might have done 20 years ago.A younger Mr. Redstone would most likely have adopted a Godfather-like Today, I will settle all family business approach. After all, that was Mr. Redstones modus operandi back in the day, suddenly firing his longtime confidant Tom Freston as chief executive after his failure to buy Myspace.In the settle-all-business situation, Mr. Redstone would have taken the following steps all on the same day:Step 1: Remove Mr. Dauman and George Abrams, Mr. Redstones longtime lawyer, as trustees of the Viacom trust, which holds Mr. Redstones controlling interest in Viacom and CBS upon Mr. Redstones death or incapacity. These two men would be succeeded with new allies sympathetic to Mr. Redstones daughter, Shari Redstone.Step 2: Remove Mr. Dauman as a director of National Amusements, Viacoms controlling shareholder.Step 3: Sue in Los Angeles County Superior Court to establish the validity of the trustee removal and the National Amusements removal. The court has the virtue of having just dismissed another lawsuit against Mr. Redstone that raised issues over his competency. (Although to be fair, the judge, there was not a specific finding of competency.)A suit in that California state court would ensure that if Mr. Dauman tried to countersue in Massachusetts  headquarters of the trust and a jurisdiction that perhaps would be more favorable to Mr. Dauman  the court there would defer to the court in Los Angeles, home of the first-filed complaint.To be sure, there are jurisdiction issues  Mr. Redstone would be litigating issues over a Massachusetts trust in California, but this would at least ensure the early litigation took place in the Los Angeles court.Step 4: Remove the Viacom directors and replace them with handpicked successors, including Ms. Redstone. Presumably, they would meet immediately and fire Mr. Dauman.As I discussed in a previous Deal Professor, as a result of a mistake in Viacoms organizational documents, Mr. Redstone, acting through National Amusements, can remove the Viacom directors anytime.Step 5: Sue in Delaware, Viacoms place of incorporation, to establish the validity of the director removal.This is a whirlwind of activity, but its purpose would be to ensure that Mr. Dauman and the Viacom board were put on the back foot to hinder them from fighting back. In particular, while Viacom is required to maintain its neutrality in this battle, this mass removal would deprive Mr. Dauman and the Viacom board of any corporate resources during this period.This is not what happened.Mr. Redstone stopped at Step 2. He simply removed Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams as trustees and also Mr. Dauman as a director of National Amusements.He did take Step 3, suing in Los Angeles, but on the same day Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams did indeed sue in Massachusetts. The pause allowed Mr. Dauman to hire top corporate litigators and to establish jurisdiction in Massachusetts, where Mr. Dauman could relitigate Mr. Redstones competency, rather than in Los Angeles, where the issue had just been heard. And the two plaintiffs are getting some traction, at least initially, with a hearing on the case scheduled for June.The pause in Mr. Redstones strategy has also allowed the Viacom board and Viacom to respond.In the case of the Viacom directors, they are already preparing for being removed and suing over any removal attempt. Indeed, Viacoms lead independent director, Frederic V. Salerno, has been so kind as to criticize Mr. Redstone and to call for a meeting, even issuing an agenda for the meeting.How trite.This is an independent director who never seemed to care much about speaking to Mr. Redstone before his removal was imminent. This board paid Mr. Redstone millions for years without a peep about his competency and decided not to pay him only a few weeks ago.The directors have also written a letter to Viacom constituencies stating that they would challenge their removal because we see that as our responsibility to the noncontrolling shareholders of Viacom who own 90 percent of the equity in the company. Funny that a board so beholden to Mr. Redstone and willing to dole out excessive compensation to both Mr. Redstone and Mr. Dauman over the years now cares about other constituencies.In any event, there is no corporate law that I know of that requires a controlling shareholder to speak to the directors of the company he controls. If Mr. Redstone wanted to communicate by carrier pigeon, that would be his prerogative. So Mr. Salerno is engaging in a public relations battle, but one that is not on very firm legal ground.Viacom itself also initially made murmurs of discontent. But as I pointed out before, the employees of Viacom should be careful. Taking sides against your majority shareholders on behalf of your chief executive is a breach of fiduciary duty, not to mention something that could get you fired when that controlling shareholder inevitably takes control back of the company.As for that Delaware litigation, it might still be coming.That litigation, by the way, is probably a loser for the Viacom directors. If you want to know why, you can read one of the key opinions on the rights of controlling shareholders and their companies, Adlerstein v. Wertheimer. In that opinion, the court held that a controlling shareholder, no matter how nefarious, had a right to control the board of the company. And that case even featured Ilan K. Reich. (If you dont know who he is, you really should.)In that case the court ordered the company into receivership, but that was because it was failing. In this case we have a simple business dispute. The law is pretty clear that a majority shareholder can act over a company unless it is looting it. The Viacom directors may try and litigate in New York to get a judge who is less versed in these issues, but that is probably their best option.I would add that the main law firm representing the company started representing the directors and then was sued for that conflict. I cant overemphasize the importance here that must be placed on keeping the company neutral in this fight.And here the majority shareholder is National Amusements. In that case, the board is made up of Sumner Redstone and two people he just appointed, along with Shari Redstone, her son Tyler and David Andelman, a CBS director. While the Viacom directors will try to argue that there is a conflict, it is hard to see how this establishes legal grounds to void National Amusements actions. It is also hard to see the Delaware courts wanting to wade into the question of Mr. Redstones capacity and trying to go higher up the chain.So the Viacom board is doomed, but still it will have time to strategize and fight a better fight.So why the wait? One theory may be that there is a bit of disorder in the Redstone camp and that he just hasnt been able to act as quickly as he used to. After all, his chief legal talent is actually at Viacom. And his slow boat actions are likely only to draw this out more as it gives time to prepare.Another view is that by being slow and deliberate, Mr. Redstone can show that he still has the mental capacity and the ability to make hard decisions. The irony, of course, is that the Sumner Redstone of old was anything but deliberate.In either case, the delay is only making it worse for Viacom the company."}
{"text": "A former United States Army sergeant with the nickname Rambo who led a team to kill a federal drug agent and a government informer was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Tuesday in Manhattan.The Army veteran, Joseph M. Hunter, 51, had worked as a sniper instructor and senior drill sergeant and was honorably discharged in 2004 after two decades. But a few years later, prosecutors said, he went to work as a mercenary for a shadowy South African businessman, helping to orchestrate murders and other violence before becoming ensnared in a sting operation run by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.In late 2012, as part of the sting operation, Mr. Hunter began assembling a security team for what he had been led to believe were Colombian narcotics traffickers but were actually confidential sources working under the direction of the D.E.A., the government has said. The following March, he told team members that they would have the opportunity to do bonus work  that is, assassinations  for which they would be paid extra, prosecutors said.In May 2013, the government said, Mr. Hunter was asked if his team would carry out the killings of the drug agent and the informer, who was said to be a boat captain who had been providing tips to the D.E.A. My guys will handle it, Mr. Hunter responded, asking if he would receive a financial bonus as well.He approached this murder plot as meticulously and thoroughly as he approached his legitimate work in his military career, Judge Laura Taylor Swain of Federal District Court said before she sentenced Mr. Hunter.In court, Mr. Hunter, a burly man with a dark beard, wept at times as he addressed the judge. He apologized and acknowledged his crimes.If I only had asked myself what God would want me to do, he said, adding, This is my biggest crime, and one that I intend to fix the rest of my life.Mr. Hunters lawyers have said in court papers that after leaving the Army, he passed the entrance exam for the New York Police Department, but declined to pursue a job with the police because he felt the cost of living would have been too high in New York.Mr. Hunter pleaded guilty in February to conspiring to murder the agent and the informer, to import cocaine into the United States and to possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. He could have received a maximum sentence of life in prison. Prosecutors had sought a sentence within the range stipulated in federal guidelines of about 24 to 30 years.His lawyers had sought a 10-year sentence, the minimum he faced. They argued that Mr. Hunter had operated under duress while working as a mercenary for the South African businessman, Paul Le Roux, an international outlaw who had threatened to kill him if he did not follow his orders. (Mr. Le Roux was later arrested, and he has cooperated with the government.)Marlon G. Kirton, a defense lawyer, suggested that Mr. Hunter, who he said had post-traumatic stress disorder, believed that he had no choice but to carry out Mr. Le Rouxs orders.But prosecutors in the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, disputed that claim, arguing that Mr. Hunter knew Mr. Le Rouxs organization was involved in illegal activities, but nonetheless left the group and later rejoined it because he wanted to make money. Greed, not duress had led him to a courtroom, a prosecutor, Emil J. Bove III, said.Judge Swain made it clear she agreed, noting that Mr. Hunter had associated himself with Mr. Le Roux voluntarily and had remained with him after becoming aware of, and involved in, his illegal activity.The safety of law enforcement agents, those helping them and of innocent people, Judge Swain said, depends on right choices, even if those choices are life or death choices.As between killing someone sworn to uphold the law, she added, and risking his own demise at the hands of people he had chosen to join in criminal activity, Mr. Hunter made the dishonorable choice."}

These are somewhat simple, straightforward foods, the sort that are flattered by the acidity, fruitiness and modest bitterness of barbera, and not out of place in the Piedmont region. When you begin to complicate dishes with piquant, pungent flavors, barbera turns out to be not as versatile as billed. Several readers discovered this to their evident consternation.One of the purposes of Wine School is firsthand learning. So much of what passes for wine knowledge is simply stuff that is read and repeated, often with authority and volume. For readers who are somewhat new to wine in its seemingly limitless variety, Wine School offers an opportunity to experience it in a natural setting, with a meal, and to form their own immediate, unmediated impressions, which I invite you to share by commenting at nytimes.com/food.For readers who already know their way around, Wine School offers an opportunity to reassess beliefs and perhaps to develop new insights. Thats how it worked for me this time.The three wines I recommended were: Vietti Barbera dAsti Tre Vigne 2013, Alessandro e Gian Natale Fantino Barbera dAlba Superiore Cascina Dardi 2013 and Bruno Giacosa Barbera dAlba 2013.Each of these, I thought, showed the characteristics that can make barberas from the areas surrounding Alba and Asti so distinctive and rewarding. The Vietti seemed the lightest-bodied of the three even though it had the most alcohol at 14 percent. It showed bright cherry flavors and perhaps even a bit of citrus, but it lacked the energy of the other barberas.The Giacosa seemed plumper and rounder, with earthy cherry flavors streaked with what reminded me of orange zest. Perhaps that accounted for the sweetness that at least two readers, Martin Schappeit of Amherst, Va., and Dan Barron of New York, detected in the wine, though it didnt strike me that way.The Fantino in particular was beautiful, I thought, fresh and juicy with the aroma and flavor of red cherries and a buzz saw acidity that cuts through rich foods. The combination of this acidity and a slight bitterness to the fruit flavor is a defining characteristic of many Italian reds. The combination seems to cleanse the palate after each sip, refreshing the mouth for the next bite. The exquisite balance in the Fantino between sweet-bitter fruit and acidity made it thrilling to drink.Why harp on how the barberas paired with food? European wine genres in general, and Italian wines even more than most, were made to go with food. You can drink these wines any way you want, alone or with a chocolate dessert. But if you want to enjoy them at their most delicious and transcendent, they require the sort of food with which they go well.I single out Italian reds because the acidity and dry bitterness in particular need food to bring out their best. This is particularly true of barbera, which can often seem too acidic on its own. But if the acidity is leavened with simple, rich food, you have beautiful harmony.The wrong sort of food can make even a wine I liked as much as the Fantino seem strange, or at least underwhelming. Mr. Barron called the Fantino boring after pairing it with ravioli in a sauce of sun-dried tomatoes and black olive pesto, served with sauted kale. Versatile with food? he fumed. Only in a make-do sort of way.Im not one to fetishize food-and-wine pairings, but a meal like that is outside the comfort zone of barbera. He probably would have been better off drinking a good Provenal ros, which was created to go with the pungent, oily flavors of these dishes. On the other hand, I found the Fantino to be brilliant with a meaty lasagna that I made.Mr. Schappeit tried the Fantino with two different dishes: a wild mushroom fettuccine, which was a pairing that he seemed to find puzzling and unsatisfying, and a mushroom-and-sausage pizza, which seemed to work well. It opened up and let me into its lush dark fruit wonderland, he wrote.Mysteriously, on another occasion with the same pizza, Mr. Schappeit said, the wine withheld its pleasures.The wine is interesting but comes with a complicated personality, he concluded.I dont know what to make of that. Mr. Barron later (a week later, in fact) tried that same bottle of Fantino with a clam, leek and fennel pasta and a tomato gratin. Predictably, the wine did not go particularly well with the pasta dish. But he liked it very much with the tomato gratin, also perhaps predictable, as a tomato roasted in the oven is a different, friendlier-to-barbera proposition than sun-dried tomatoes.The pattern seemed to hold for most readers. The more straightforward the dish, the better it went with the barbera. The more complex, the more problematic. But even some of the easy matches didnt work out that well. Todd of the Hudson Valley said that a 2014 Vietti Barbera dAlba (yes, Vietti produces barberas from both Asti and Alba) was too harsh with a homemade pizza, but that it went beautifully with a creamy pasta dish.What accounts for barberas seeming low percentage of success in these pairings? Aside from its mysterious failure with Todds pizza, the results suggest that with barbera we should tread lightly outside the tried and true. A wine with as much acidity as barbera needs either foods that can match its acidity (like pastas with tomato-based sauces, which are naturally acidic) or rich, meaty foods and cheeses, with which it dovetails.Barberas will not go so well with vinegary foods, pungent, oily foods or shellfish. These may all be better served with crisp whites. For a wine that is actually versatile in practice, may I suggest rieslings, which I can say with conviction operate beautifully outside the realm of regional pairings.Underlying this discussion is the real lesson: The very best way to learn about wine is to drink it and decide for yourself. You can read about it as much as you like, internalizing the thinking of others and memorizing facts, all of which may prove useful. But for matters of taste, nothing beats the wisdom of firsthand experience."}
{"text": "A few years ago, the biggest enemy of the music industry was Pandora Media. Then Spotify became the target.Now it is YouTubes turn.In recent months, the music world has been united to a rare degree in a public fight against YouTube, accusing the service of paying too little in royalties and asking for changes to the law that allows the company to operate the way it does. The battle highlights the need to capture every dollar as listeners habits turn to streaming, as well as the industrys complicated relationship with YouTube.The dispute has played out in a drumbeat of industry reports, blog posts and opinion columns. Stars like Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams and Billy Joel have signed letters asking for changes to copyright laws. Irving Azoff, the manager of artists like the Eagles and Christina Aguilera, criticized YouTube in an interview and in a fiery speech around the Grammy Awards.Also, annual sales statistics were released showing that YouTube, despite its gigantic audience, produces less direct income for musicians than the niche market of vinyl record sales.This is the result of an explosion of views of music videos on YouTube against a backdrop of decline in the recorded music business in general, Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York Universitys Steinhardt School, said of the fight.With more than a billion users, including the youngest and most engaged music fans, YouTube has long been seen by the music business as a vital way to promote songs and hunt for the next star. At the same time, music executives grumble that it has never been a substantial source of revenue and is a vexing outlet for leaks and unauthorized material.It may not be a coincidence that the major record labels are also in the midst of renegotiating their licensing contracts with YouTube this year.In its newest effort, the music industry has asked the federal government to change the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, saying that the law, which was passed in 1998 and protects sites like YouTube that host copyrighted material posted by users, is outdated and makes removing unauthorized content too difficult.Cary Sherman, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, says that even when songs are taken down, they can easily be uploaded again.This is a new form of piracy, he said. You dont have to go into dark corners and sell stuff out of your car. You can do it in plain sight and rely on the D.M.C.A. to justify that what youre doing is perfectly legal.Europes copyright protections are also under review, and last month, Andrus Ansip, the European Commissions digital chief, called on YouTube to pay more for its content. But so far, YouTube does not seem shaken.In an interview, Robert Kyncl, YouTubes chief business officer, said that since its inception in 2005, YouTube has paid $3 billion to the music industry around the world. (In earlier statements, YouTube has said that Google, its parent company, paid that amount across all of its sites, but Mr. Kyncl now says that YouTube alone has contributed that sum and that other Google services have added even more.)Music matters tremendously to us, Mr. Kyncl said. Artists matter to us. We are connecting artists and fans on our platforms.He also pointed to the sites new subscription plan, YouTube Red, and said YouTubes copyright protections were functioning as they should. Content ID, the sites proprietary system, lets copyright owners keep track of their material, and when the system detects a new video including a tracked song  whether in a full music video or just the background of a user-uploaded clip  the owner can choose to keep the video online or take it down.According to YouTube, 98 percent of copyright claims on its system are made through Content ID, and 99.5 percent of the claims related to music are handled automatically. YouTube says about half the money it pays in music royalties is related to user-generated videos that incorporate music processed through Content ID.We are working to create what has become the most significant revenue generator in the entertainment industry, Mr. Kyncl said, which is a dual revenue stream where you monetize all people: heavy users through subscription, and light users through advertising.But the music world argues that YouTubes financial contributions have not kept pace with the popularity of its streams. In March, the recording industry associations annual report of sales statistics, usually a dry financial summary, criticized YouTube harshly. It said that free ad-supported sites like it, which let users pick specific songs on demand, paid $385 million to record labels in the United States  less than the $416 million collected from the sale of just 17 million vinyl records.Spotify paid about $1.8 billion last year for music licensing and related costs, according to the companys annual returns, although the average royalty rates for its free tier are not much different from YouTubes, by some estimates.The fight over the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has touched a nerve. The music industry is bracing for what may be a high-wattage lobbying battle reminiscent of the one over the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill that was abandoned in 2012 after opposition from technology activists and Internet giants like Google and Wikipedia.The copyright law gives safe harbor to Internet service providers that host third-party material. While music groups criticize the law, some legal scholars and policy specialists say any change to it would need to be considered carefully, particularly to preserve protections like fair use.Anything that rewrites the D.M.C.A. isnt just going to affect YouTube, said James Grimmelmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland. It is going to affect blogs. It is going to affect fan sites. It is going to affect places for game creators and documentarians and all kinds of others.In December, the United States Copyright Office asked for comments about D.M.C.A. as part of a review of the law, and filings by record companies show how laborious copyright policing can be. Universal Music said that after Taylor Swifts album 1989 was released in late 2014, the company devoted a team of employees full time to search for unauthorized copies; to date, the company said, it has sent 66,000 takedown notices to various sites about 1989, in addition to 114,000 blocks on YouTube made automatically through Content ID.Maria Schneider, a Grammy-winning jazz composer, said in an interview that the problem was particularly acute for independent acts like her, who do not have Content ID accounts, and that the D.M.C.A.s takedown process discouraged lawful requests.YouTube says that about 8,000 companies and organizations have access to Content IDand that independents may get access through affiliated companies and industry groups. Mr. Kyncl said the steps in the takedown process were meant to ensure the accuracy of requests and deter false claims.Mr. Azoff said that after the Copyright Office made its request, he and other managers asked artists they represented whether they wanted to sign a letter calling for changes to the law.Not one artist declined, he said.But if there are creators who like their music on YouTube and SoundCloud, thats fine, Mr. Azoff said. The whole point is choice: Artists should be able to choose."}
{"text": "BERGA, Spain  The Patum, a spectacular festival here that dates to medieval times, plays out the struggle between good and evil  represented by costumes and statues of angels, fire-wielding demons and dragons, and Christian knights fighting Turks and Moors  amid raucous celebrations over five days.But here in the heartland of Catalonia, the festival has also come to symbolize the far more modern political and social struggles of Spain  between right and left, church and state, the Spanish government in Madrid and Catalan secessionists.Catalonias independence drive has imbued the Patum, like so many other cultural symbols and expressions here, with ever greater nationalist significance for Catalans.On Sunday, the far-left mayor of Berga, Montserrat Venturs, 30, watched the climax of the Patum from the town halls balcony. Other separatist politicians sat alongside her, but no representatives from the Catholic Church or the Spanish military were present, apparently for the first time in the festivals history.The mayor did not invite them. She also did not attend the Catholic Mass that traditionally opens the final, frenzied day of celebrations.The Patum is the only surviving festival of its kind in Catalonia, a distinction recognized by Unesco, which designated it in 2005 as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. But even if its street performances date to the 14th century, and its oldest official document is from 1621, the Patum continues to evolve.Like many such festivals, the Patum has religious origins, celebrated during the Catholic Feast of Corpus Christi, but it also has strong pagan elements.In medieval times, the Patums dancing followed a drum beat, whose pa-tum sound probably gave the festival its name. A band was later added, and on Sunday one of the dances was even performed to music adapted from a Bruce Springsteen song.The mayor justified the decision to reduce the Patums links to the church in the context of a secular society with weakening ties to Catholicism.That things have always been done a certain way doesnt mean you should never adapt to how we live and feel, in a secular country, she said in an interview. In the 21st century, I see no need for the church to keep the same role in this feast.Ms. Venturss defiance has reached beyond the Patum. In April, she refused to appear in court after being charged with flying the Estelada, a flag that has become an emblem for Catalan secessionists, on the town hall during elections.Im not going to stand in a politicized trial, shaped by the politicians in Madrid, when Im now helping build a new country, Ms. Venturs said. Im here to respond to the will of my own people.Ramon Minoves Pujols, a town hall councilor from the conservative Convergence party, said the mayor should have gone to Mass on Sunday to represent the city, even if she did not agree with Mass. Its just a lack of respect, he said.Mr. Minoves Pujols wore a suit and tie, like most others from his party, in contrast to the sleeveless tops and T-shirts chosen by the mayor and her colleagues from the Popular Unity Candidacy, known by its Catalan acronym, CUP. These colleagues included Francesc Ribera, a musician turned politician better known as Titot, whose band, Brams, became popular in the 1990s.When I first started singing, the independence movement was residual in Catalonia, but now that independence really drives us forward, its normal to make it a more important part of our feast, he said.Marc Maj, the local priest, said after celebrating Sunday Mass that he was sad to see his church sidelined from the Patum for the first time.The fact is that the roots of the Patum are religious, so it makes every sense to continue to invite each other, he said. But Im not here to promote a new conflict between church and state when we have so many more serious problems to deal with.Santi Vila, Catalonias regional cultural minister, who was visiting on Sunday from Barcelona, the Catalan capital, said, If there was not such a strong patriotic feeling here, I think the Patum probably wouldnt have resisted to all the political regimes and changes over so many centuries.In fact, the Patum has increasingly become a source of pride and integration in our town, said Pere Gendrau, a journalist who carried one of the 12-foot-high statues during the Patum. Carriers used to be paid to lift the giant statues, he noted, but people now fight for this honor.After municipal elections in May last year, Berga and its roughly 16,000 inhabitants became the most important Catalan town hall run by the CUP, a radical party that has punched above its weight in Catalan politics recently and is playing a pivotal role in the secession drive.After forcing the replacement of Artur Mas as Catalonias regional president in January, CUP lawmakers are threatening to scuttle a regional budget deal if other separatist parties do not accelerate the secessionist plan. The budget dispute could force Catalonia to hold repeat elections.The Patum lasts five days, officially culminating on Sunday, but it stretched into the early hours of Monday. During a final collective frenzy, the towns asymmetric square, overflowing with thousands of dancing revelers, was invaded by masked demons, known as Plens.The demons used the cover of darkness to spread across the crowd and set off firecrackers attached to their costumes, turning the square into a hellish ball of fire and smoke. (About 900 firecrackers and 100 flares were used.)Monitoring the earlier stages of the Patum from the top of the town hall, Joaquim Mas, an official in charge of the logistics and pyrotechnics of the festival, said that he was delighted to see the Estelada hanging from balconies, as well as wrapped around the neck of the eagle and dragon statues. He added that he was equally pleased that he did not see any priest on the balcony.This has always been a great occasion for Berga and Catalonia, but I really feel everything has just got perfect this year, Mr. Mas said. He added that he was also looking forward to the final inferno re-creation, but partly for more practical reasons.All good things need to come to an end  and Ive not slept for four nights, he said."}
{"text": "Union Fare First came a cafe that becomes a wine bar in the evening. Stage 2 of this sprawling complex in part of the original Barnes & Noble bookstore is a restaurant. A very long bar opposite high-top tables leads to a dining room that is a study in recycling, decorated in reclaimed wood, with chairs strapped in rubber from discarded tires. Theres a raw bar and a charcuterie station. The chef, Yvan Lemoine, focuses on seasonal American fare. At his side, and supplying the cafe with baked goods, is Thiago Silva.

{"text": "At a news conference in Trump Tower on Tuesday morning, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald J. Trump shared his thoughts about the political press and Harambe, the gorilla that Cincinnati Zoo officials shot and killed after a small child wandered into his enclosure.Mr. Trump had nicer things to say about the gorilla.The news conference  which Mr. Trump called to defend himself over questions about fund-raising for veterans charities  was a textbook example of the candidates need to devour media attention and deplore it at the same time.The offense reporters committed this time: asking whether the money he said he had raised at a January benefit  organized in place of a Fox News debate he was skipping  had really made it to the beneficiaries, and if so, how much.A candidate said he would do a thing; reporters tried to confirm whether he had. (Last week The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump had not yet made his own donation.) This, to Mr. Trump, was an outrage, an affront, not very nice treatment at all. He said he had not wanted to claim credit for his deeds  which he promoted, allowed to be covered on television and referred to during the campaign  but the nosy press had forced his hand.So he showed up at the news conference with a list of donations and recipients, as well as a list of grievances. Tom Llamas, a reporter from ABC News, was a sleaze, he said; Jim Acosta, of CNN, a real beauty.The event, carried live on the major cable networks, showed how Mr. Trump uses his media omnipresence to control his message. By railing at the questions, he was able to send a headline to voters, repeated on the chyrons  that the candidate raised money for vets  while mostly pushing past questions of when he did it and whether his earlier claims had been truthful at the time he made them.The reporters pushed back, pressing Mr. Trump not just on the donations but also on his continued attacks against detractors in the Republican Party, on his press-bashing, on whether he is too thin-skinned for the presidency. Mr. Trump, of course, believes that his skin, like all other parts of him, is fine as it is.And he essentially promised that, should he be elected, this news conference would be a preview of White House press room sessions to come.Mr. Trump may dish out abuse to the press, but at least hes a source of constant quotes. His likely fall opponent, Hillary Clinton, is more polite but also more guarded. (Or as a New York magazine profile by Rebecca Traister this week bluntly put it, Clinton hates the press even if she doesnt pummel them for the cameras.)This relative silence has helped Mr. Trump dominate airtime and make the news cycle his floor-to-ceiling mirror. Mrs. Clinton has lately tried to fill the vacuum by doing more interviews; Tuesday afternoon, she phoned in, Trump-style, to Jake Tapper on CNN and Chris Hayes on MSNBC. Both of them led their interviews by asking her what she thought of Mr. Trumps news conference.Mr. Trump is not the first candidate to bash the news media while craving its attention. Hes just made the contradiction, like everything he builds, bigger and gaudier.Hes collected, by a New York Times estimate, $2 billion in free media. And he attacks, mocks and threatens news outlets when they arent nice, building bona fides with a voter base that has been encouraged for decades to see Big Media as the enemy.He can glad-hand journalists, then turn peevish and furious. The whole impetus for the news conference, remember, was an event he held when he was angry at Fox News. Now he has nothing but nice things to say about Fox News, because hes sewn up the nomination, and the network has become very, very nice to him.And then there came the question about Harambe, because it is 2016, and this is what we do now: We ask the reality TV star who may become the leader of the free world how tough he would be on large zoo animals.It was poetically fitting. For almost a year, Mr. Trump has been the 800-pound gorilla whose unpredictable rampages have obsessed the news media. Now he was completing the circle by commenting on the 400-pound gorilla who briefly stole the spotlight from him for one holiday weekend.For the record, Mr. Trump said that he thought zoo officials had little choice but to shoot Harambe. But, he added: There were moments with the gorilla, the way he held that child, it was almost like a mother with a baby. It looked so beautiful and calm. And then there were moments when it looked pretty dangerous.So it is with Mr. Trump and the news media, and their volatile symbiosis. Tuesday morning, he was in raging silverback mode, glowering, posturing and verbally dragging the press around his gilded Manhattan lair.But viewed from another vantage point, it can look as if he were holding them very close."}
{"text": "Keeping good small restaurants to myself is not what Im paid for. Sure, Ive enjoyed finding empty seats every night Ive eaten at Mr. Donahues and Ruffian Wine Bar & Chefs Table. Yes, I worry that both places would capsize under the strain of a party of six, let alone a full crew of hungry New York Times readers. But I didnt take a newspaper job to keep secrets. I did it for the company stock.The smaller of the two is Mr. Donahues, although this is like a contest between a lentil and a chickpea. There are four chairs at two tables. Very nearby at the counter are five stools. Sitting at one, you see dime-store jars of hard candy, a lamp with a fringed pink shade, a Depression glass vase under a cloud of babys breath. You see a wicker monkey hanging by one arm above a window into the kitchen, where chickens make leisurely circles on a rotisserie.Most of these items were bought by the couple who own the restaurant, the chefs Ann Redding and Matt Danzer, who also own Uncle Boons. But the way theyve put it together, everything just seems to have gradually accumulated over the decades. Its as if youd stepped into one of the little lunch counters with unpremeditated dcor that used to be found in this part of town before it was called NoLIta.Five main courses and about twice as many side dishes are spelled in white on a letter board that has a blue-and-red Pepsi logo at the top. You pick two sides and a sauce at no extra cost. They will be served next to your main course on a sectioned china or glass plate, each in its own well, another tune from the past.Were not supposed to want to eat this way anymore. Maybe thats why, when I got my chicken-fried pork cheeks with Swiss chard and crab imperial, I was filled with gratitude. The chard was cooked with a little garlic and lemon and bread crumbs. The crab tasted of mayonnaise and Tabasco and had been browned and warmed inside a heavy foil dish in the shape of a crab shell. I spread it on saltines from a crinkly cellophane wrapper and ate it with the sensation of having found something Id lost such a long time ago that Id forgotten about it.Under rough whorls of golden batter, the cheeks were more tender and juicy than chicken-fried steak ever is. I ate them with a fine sauce of button mushrooms and Marsala, not too sweet. The romesco sauce  unorthodox, with more spicy red oil than usual  was very good with a whole porgy or the broiled steak of steelhead trout that replaced it. Honest-to-goodness gravy, rounded and meaty-tasting, is what you want with the heroic slab of roast beef. The beef was thoroughly rosy except at the edges, where it had a salty, crunchy, herb-flecked crust.The rotisserie chicken tasted like rotisserie chicken.With so few voices in the room, you almost always hear the music, which is soft and sounds as if it were coming from a tube radio that is still picking up an AM show that was broadcast a couple of years before the Beatles played Shea Stadium. Its all big bands and crooners singing sweet words that are sad underneath, like Ill be seeing you in all the old familiar places. (The only place hell be seeing her is in his head.)Cheap nostalgia hands you a fake past to make you smile. True nostalgia is mixed with pain because it conjures a past that was real and isnt coming back. The nostalgia Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer bring to Mr. Donahues is the second kind. Every detail shows their longing for the bygone world of Mr. Danzers grandfather Frank Donahue. He was a detective. His police cap sits on a shelf.For dessert, there is a root-beer float, if thats what you want. Me, Ill probably keep ordering the banana pudding forever, or until this mirage on Mott Street goes under and joins the past.Just west of Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, Ruffian Wine Bar & Chefs Table has more seats but not much more space. Theres barely enough room to squeeze your way to an empty stool at the concrete counter. The ones who are really in a tight spot, though, are the two chefs, Josh Ochoa and Andy Alexandre.Jammed behind one end of the counter, they arrange cheeses with house-made jam, warm some marinated olives that are as smoky as bacon, toast sliced baguettes for a knockout tomato chutney, plate some crisp, young radishes with bagna cauda, spread out sliced cross sections of fennel bulbs marinated simply and deliciously with sherry vinegar and fennel seeds, and plunge an immersion blender into batters that will go into the tiny convection oven and emerge as three-inch souffls.The cheese souffl, almost like a tower of soft scrambled eggs, makes a lush spread for toast darkened with a swirl of balsamic vinegar. The last time I went, it had been replaced by an equally good one with crab.I expected to like the beef tartare, but its sherry vinegar dressing made it too soupy and sour. I had no expectations of lentil salad, but its one of the best things on the menu. A variety of lentils and other legumes are firm, separate, not at all mushy, seasoned with dried chiles and curry leaves, swirled with yogurt sauce, and sprinkled with crisp threads of sev, the chickpea-flour snacks. Suddenly, dull old lentil salad is an exciting Indian street festival. (Mr. Ochoa and Mr. Alexandre met Patrick Cournot, an owner and a sommelier at Ruffian, when they all worked at Tabla.)There is usually a savory pie, either a big and imposing thing to be carved into wedges, or a small turnover filled lets say with a well-seasoned mince of rabbit meat.The profiteroles are odd and overelaborated, with an acidic cream of mandarin oranges. The chocolate souffl is better, if you have time to wait. In this kitchen, the only way to cook is one dish at a time.But of course you have time; youre here to drink wine from a list that evidences Mr. Cournots open-minded curiosity. Like every other wine bar in town, Ruffian stocks some stars of the natural wine movement. Its also picking up on the Georgian signals coming out of the Caucasus. But other choices show an independence from the latest trends, like a violet-scented pinot noir from Chile.Elena Hull Cournot, Mr. Cournots wife, has given this tight alley a surprisingly light, almost airy design, although the detail I remember most is the portrait of a horse on the back wall. She painted it with it a garland of orange flowers around its neck, like a lei. It has kind eyes and a nonjudgmental expression, fine traits in a portrait that hangs in a bar. A friend who has a lot of horse sense said, The horse looks wise.Horse, Ill be seeing you."}
{"text": "What did we learn from the Great Recession? With economic growth creeping ahead at a glacial pace and another cyclical downturn looming not far in the future, questions about how to stimulate growth and protect the most vulnerable loom large on the list of priorities.Last week in Washington, I sat down with Shaun Donovan, director of the White Houses Office of Management and Budget, and Lawrence H. Summers, former Treasury secretary and onetime economic adviser to President Obama, to discuss the issue. Our conversation was hosted by the Hamilton Project, a research group within the Brookings Institution.Edited selections from the conversation are below.Eduardo Porter: Good afternoon. We are here to chat about how to mitigate the effect of the inevitable future recession. What can we learn from our response to the last one? At this moment, interest rates are near zero and the Federal Reserve is arguably out of ammunition. And were already seven years into the recovery. Maybe this prospect is not that far down the line.The question is not just about how to reignite growth after the next downturn. Another very important question is about how to protect the most vulnerable when the next recession hits. The experience of the last one suggests our social safety net needs some redesigning. Too many disenfranchised people were left without assistance. The programs that we have missed too many.Shaun Donovan: Let me start with a simple point, which is that it did work and worked better than I think many people recognized. The recovery act alone saved about four- to five-and-a-half-million people from falling into poverty as a result of the recession. And there were 12 additional measures that were passed beyond the recovery act that took us to a total response that was about $1.4 trillion.One of the most profound mistakes, I think, was Congress shifting toward austerity and producing a set of manufactured crises that hurt the economy. If you look at the combination of sequestration and the government shutdown, you are looking at likely over a million jobs lost as a result.At a time where the politics to do what we did in the aftermath of the Great Recession are arguably even harder, the automatic stabilization that can be provided in the safety net is even more important.Lawrence Summers: I think it is a mistake to be too satisfied with where we have been. If we look at the period from 1929 to 1940 and what happened to G.D.P. [gross domestic product] per adult American and we look at the period from 2008 to 2019 as best we can judge it, it is equivalent.The odds are better than 50-50 that we will have a recession within the next few years. What does the Fed normally do when that happens? The Fed normally cuts real interest rates by five percentage points. Is it conceivable that there is going to be room to do that, even maybe allowing for Q.E. [quantitative easing], even recognizing that maybe rates could become negative 50 basis points? I submit that its not.So, changes in the fiscal monetary mix are essential. They are the only tools available when the next recession comes, and I would submit that they are desirable right now.What are the crucial elements of changing the fiscal monetary mix? One is a substantial increase in public investment. It is insane that federal investment in infrastructure is now net negative at a moment when interest rates have never been lower. And precious little is happening at the state and local level, either.Second, strong support for social insurance. When Keynes came to the United States in 1942, he pointed out that an important virtue of Social Security was that it could absorb the excess savings that would potentially hold back U.S. economic growth after the Second World War. Those considerations were not relevant in the succeeding 60 years, but they potentially are relevant in our current period of secular stagnation. Note that an expansion of pay-as-you-go Social Security does not raise the annual budget deficit, but in every economic model contributes to raising aggregate demand by enabling households to look forward to more secure retirements.Third, there is a strong case for doing what we can to promote housing investment. We are managing the cycle in the worst way possible from the point of view of housing. We got all of the lower-middle-income and poor people into their own houses when the price was going up and was a bubble. Then when the price plummeted, they all sold to private equity firms who rented the houses out at a 10 percent yield and earned tremendous capital gains. This is exactly the wrong moment for support for housing to be at a minimum rather than a maximum.Fourth, related to my first point, this is the moment to be maintaining the infrastructure we have. The one thing we know  if you look at airports, if you look at highways, if you look at the water system of Flint, Michigan  it is much more costly to defer maintenance than it is to do maintenance promptly. It is every bit as much a burden on my childrens generation to defer maintenance as it is to issue paper debt, and I promise you that the costs compound far more rapidly with deferred maintenance than they do with the 13 basis points that represent the real interest costs of current long-term federal debt.The most important determinant of our long-term fiscal picture is how successful we are at accelerating the economys growth rate in the next three to five years, not the austerity measures that we implement. People concerned with our long-term fiscal health should be redoubling their focus on the currently inadequate growth rate.Mr. Porter: What about the politics? How do we overcome gridlock?Mr. Summers: We need to move from a politics of either/or to a politics of both. I stress some of the problems that I think are most important but I think the argument that there are changes in the corporate tax code that would stimulate investments has some validity. Complaints about excessive regulation that holds back small and medium-sized business have some validity. There are a whole set of issues around stimulating private investment that warrant attention as well.I believe passionately in more infrastructure investment, but the concerns that government doesnt do it so well are not stupid concerns. There is a bridge right outside my office. It connects Harvard Square with Boston. The bridge is 232 feet long. It has been under repair, with traffic blocked, for four and one-half years. It took 11 months to build the bridge the first time.Youre not going to get a commitment to a public sector-led fiscal policy strategy without also having a strategy that is about private sector activity and private sector investment.Mr. Porter: Perhaps we can talk about social insurance. One criticism of our current system is that it is excessively tied to work, to provide an incentive to work and to reward work. So it malfunctioned when there was no work to be had. An idea that has been making the rounds, that has the support of even some people on the right, is a universal basic income, which is totally disassociated from work. Is there a case to be made for something like that?Mr. Summers: As a relevant response to current problems in the current context, I think not. The core problem with the universal income is that, how do you finance it? If you give $5,000 to everybody, thats $1.5 trillion. Now the right-wing view of that is that youre going to get that money by cutting all the existing needs-tested programs, which means that some of the poorest people around are only going to be getting $1,500 so that you and I can get our share of the universal income. I dont think thats a very good idea.The basic truth is that giving people benefits does influence their behavior. There are a large number of people in our society  little children, people who are 75 years old, people who are disabled  who arent going to work no matter what. Then there is what you can prudently afford to give to people where there are going to be large incentive effects. So there are a variety of incremental reforms that would broaden eligibility for various existing programs that I would support, but the universal basic income is one of those ideas that the longer you look at it, the less enthusiastic you become.Mr. Donovan: I think its important that we are able to re-look at these programs and understand both the short-term costs that there may be and how to design around those, and also the enormously powerful difference in long-run effects.Literally over decades you are seeing improvements of a third to a half in lifetime earnings from things like housing vouchers or others. If you think of the costs of someone not working, if you think of all the attendant health care, criminal justice and other impacts, the truth is that these investments may actually pay for themselves multiple times over."}

{"text": "HONG KONG  The Japanese corporation Mitsubishi Materials apologized on Wednesday to Chinese workers who were forced to work in its predecessor companys mines during World War II, and it signed an agreement in Beijing to compensate three surviving former laborers.The agreement represents a rare step toward alleviating lingering anger over Japans brutal occupation of China.The Second World War ended 70 years ago, and our forced labor case today has finally reached a solution, one of the former laborers, Yan Yucheng, 87, told reporters after the signing. This is a great victory.Nearly 40,000 Chinese men were taken to Japan in the final years of World War II and forced to work in slavelike conditions for 35 companies. Roughly one in five died because of maltreatment.Under the agreement with Mitsubishi Materials, the three survivors will each receive 100,000 renminbi, or about $15,000.A survey by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 3,765 Chinese were forced to work for the company, then known as Mitsubishi Mining Corporation.The apology and compensation are not the first between a Japanese company and Chinese workers. In 2000 the Kajima Corporation, a construction company, paid a settlement to survivors and families of deceased workers. In 2009 Nishimatsu Construction also apologized and paid compensation.South Korean courts have ordered Japanese companies to pay compensation to Koreans who were forced to work during the war.The Mitsubishi Materials agreement is intended to be a template for future settlements with survivors or with the families of former workers who have died, said Naoto Tokushige, a Mitsubishi Materials spokesman.Fewer than 20 of the former laborers are known to be living, and less than half of the families have been identified.Tong Zeng, president of the China Federation of Demanding Compensation From Japan, said about 1,000 families of deceased workers had agreed to the deal, about 95 percent of the known total.Not all of the known survivors have agreed, however. A lawyer representing four former laborers and about 60 families said they were not prepared to sign. One of their concerns is that the company has avoided mentioning that many of the Chinese laborers were tortured, said the lawyer, Kang Jian.If this is a sincere move, Id applaud it, Ms. Kang said. But I dont think this is a sincere reconciliation.Mitsubishi Materials said in a statement that it continues to seek a comprehensive and permanent solution with all of its former laborers and their families.The company said it would set up a fund to build memorials at the site of the mines and would search for former laborers and their families. The settlement was announced last year, before the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.China held numerous events last year to mark the anniversary of the end of the war, which some observers said was symbolic of the continuing rivalry between the two countries. Chinas military strength is steadily increasing, and Japan wants to remove some of the restrictions on its armed forces that were put in place after the war.China claims islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan. Japans wartime occupation of China also remains a delicate issue.Last week, after President Obama visited Hiroshima, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China suggested that the Imperial Japanese Armys massacre of Chinese civilians in the city of Nanjing in 1937 deserved greater attention than did Hiroshima, where an American atomic bomb killed tens of thousands of people.Last year Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country inflicted immeasurable damage and suffering on innocent people, and has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.But many in China have questioned the sincerity of Japanese remorse.Some critics noted Mr. Abe also said that future generations, who had nothing to do with the war, should not be predestined to apologize."}
{"text": "Great Plains Energy has charged up for a $12.2 billion purchase of larger neighbor Westar Energy. The transaction unveiled on Tuesday has features typical of pairings between regulated American electric utilities. Investors may be right, though, to worry that the buyer is overpaying.The two companies serve neighboring territories from their respective Kansas City, Mo., and Topeka, Kan., headquarters. They already operate power plants together. So it is not surprising that Great Plains, with a market capitalization of $4.8 billion on Friday, won the auction that had bred rumors about a Westar sale.The $8.6 billion that Terry Bassham, the chief executive of Great Plains, is paying for Westars equity is about $1 billion more than Westars value on Friday, a 13 percent premium. Given that talk has already pushed the shares up, though, the markup is really larger. Regulated utilities are usually cautious on premiums because cost savings often only last until watchdogs push prices down and shift most of the benefit to customers.That is also why the likes of Great Plains and Westar are often cagey about synergies. Executives did, however, compare the transaction with the formers 2008 purchase of Missouri-based Aquila. In that case, targeted synergies topped 11 percent of the combined entitys operating and maintenance expenses excluding fuel, according to a regulatory filing at the time. Using the same figure, the implied savings for Great Plains and Westar could be around $120 million a year.Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those synergies would be generously valued at less than $800 million today, not counting the expense or time required to realize them. That is short of even the headline premium, helping to explain why Great Plains investors marked the companys shares down about 5 percent by midday.Preserving Great Plains credit rating, while funding 85 percent of the consideration in cash, is no picnic, either. To balance $4.4 billion of new debt, Mr. Bassham is planning over $3 billion of equity issuance. As a first step, he has the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System buying $750 million of convertible preferred stock. With dividends running at 7.25 percent and not deductible for tax, that is expensive.Scale may bring greater efficiency than expected, help keep two states regulators happy and even nudge growth higher. But with Great Plains taking such a big bite and the likelihood that gains will be short-lived, it is no wonder its shareholders are signaling the deal lacks spark."}
{"text": "June is a month of weddings and graduations, leaving men with the challenge of dressing appropriately without succumbing to the heat. Here, we present five lightweight solutions to this annual sartorial dilemma.The Jeffrey Rdes label offers a linen suit, in black, that works for any festive summer occasion. Guys need a more natural feeling about their formal jackets, and that comes with softer construction, said Mr. Rdes, who started his namesake brand in 2015.Another warm-weather option is available from Ralph Lauren: a gossamer-like formal sport coat, in silk, with silk pants. Herms achieves a similar feel through a different fabric, with an unlined cotton-and-jersey jacket so thin that its almost sheer.From the British designer Margaret Howell comes a linen shawl-collar jacket with a boxy cut. Its distinctive shape suggests a nonchalant formality, and pairing it with a silky pajama shirt emphasizes the effect. The single-breasted linen and wool blazer and pants from Berluti are especially relaxed and easy to wear as well.All of these choices look great with a traditional shirt and tie, but summer allows for a loosening of the rules. The key is really in the way that a summer outfit is put together, Mr. Rdes said."}
{"text": "Janice Crouch, who founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network with her husband, Paul, and preached a gospel of prosperity with him on TBN programs, reaching millions of viewers around the world, died on Tuesday. She was 78.Her death was confirmed in a family statement on TBNs website. The network said she had been hospitalized on May 25 after a stroke, but gave no other details.At her death, the network and members of her family were fighting in court over multiple lawsuits, including one involving an accusation of rape and a cover-up, and another claiming financial improprieties.Mrs. Crouch was a convivial and colorful presence on the air, typically appearing in a bouffant frosted pink or champagne. Speaking with a singsong lilt, she referred to herself as Mama as she delivered an uplifting version of Scripture that included personal encounters with the divine and linked spirituality to material success.A donation to their church, the Crouches said, would be repaid with divinely ordained riches.Mrs. Crouch and her husband were the longtime hosts of TBNs talk show Praise the Lord. She was also TBNs vice president and director of network programming, helping to develop many of its popular shows.The Crouches started their network as a single station, now called KTBN-TV 40, in Santa Ana, Calif., in 1973 with the help of the televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, who went on to found their own hugely popular televised ministry in South Carolina.In time, Mr. Crouch said, a vision inspired him to invest in satellite distribution, which became the foundation of TBNs global broadcasting empire.TBN, which calls itself the worlds most watched religious broadcaster, now has programming 24 hours a day, providing Bible study, religious movies and soap operas, and Christian rock videos. Evangelists like Pat Robertson, Billy Graham and Robert H. Schuller have appeared on the network.The network says its shows are translated into many languages and appear on more than 80 satellite channels and more than 5,000 television stations. TBNs parent company listed $799,244,556 in total assets and received $52,905,172 in contributions and grants in its tax filings for 2014, the most recent year available.Twice a year, the Crouches held Praise-a-thons, fund-raising drives in which they appealed for donations to keep programs like Praise the Lord on the air.The Crouches were criticized for using those donations to finance a luxurious lifestyle, including the use of private jets. The family was reported to have multiple homes, among them his-and-hers mansions in Newport Beach, Calif.In 2007, TBN purchased Holy Land Experience, a religious theme park in Orlando, Fla., for $37 million. Mrs. Crouch became Holy Lands president and creative director and began a major remodeling of the park, renting adjacent rooms in a luxury hotel for nearly two years. One was used to house clothing and her two Maltese dogs, which otherwise occupied a motor home.The family controversies made headlines in 2004, when The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr. Crouch had paid a former employee, Enoch Lonnie Ford, $425,000 in 1998 after Mr. Ford threatened to sue TBN for unjustly firing him. As part of the settlement, the newspaper said, Mr. Ford agreed not to publicize his claim that he had had a sexual encounter with Mr. Crouch. But Mr. Ford later threatened to publish a manuscript that discussed the matter.Mr. Crouch denied Mr. Fords claims, and the case was settled by a private arbitrator.In 2012, The Orange County Register reported that a granddaughter, Carra Crouch, had sued the network that year, alleging that she was raped by a TBN employee in 2006, when she was 13, and that the Crouch family had covered up the assault. The suit contended that when Carra Crouch told her grandmother about the assault, Mrs. Crouch became furious and screamed at her granddaughter, saying, It is your fault.That suit has not yet been resolved, according to documents in Orange County Superior Court.In another lawsuit filed around the same time, another granddaughter, Brittany Koper, who was TBNs finance director, accused the network of misusing donated money. Ms. Koper and her husband, Michael, were fired and accused by the network of stealing $1.3 million.TBN has since filed multiple suits against the Kopers. Paul Crouch Jr., Mrs. Crouchs son and Ms. Kopers father, was forced off TBNs staff and quit its board because of the acrimony.Janice Wendell Bethany was born in New Brockton, Ala., on March 14, 1938. She grew up in Columbus, Ga., as a pastors daughter raised in the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination.She graduated from high school and attended Evangel College (now Evangel University) in Springfield, Mo., before she met Paul Crouch in 1956. They married a year later and began to preach. Mr. Crouch also worked in radio and television, and in 1965, they moved to California to pursue their career in religious television.Mr. Crouch died in 2013. Mrs. Crouch is survived by Paul Jr. and another son, Matthew, who is TBNs chairman; a sister, Dorothy Casoria; several grandchildren; and a great-grandchild."}

{"text": "WENZHOU, China  Chen Furong and his wife bought their home 23 years ago for its proximity to the city center and for the tree-lined canal just outside. Their dream was to pass it on to their children and grandchildren, a piece of wealth giving their family a share of Chinas economic miracle.Then their neighbor tried to sell her place  and it was all thrown into doubt.Like every other homeowner in China, Mr. Chen and his neighbor own their homes but not the land underneath them. All land in China is owned by the government, which parcels it out to developers and homeowners through 20- to 70-year leases.When the neighbor  whose surname is Wang  tried to sell her apartment, local officials told her that her lease on the land had expired. To sell her apartment, they told her, she would have to pay them one-third of the sales value.Ms. Wang protested in a move that drew national attention. Suddenly millions of Chinese who had socked away billions  and possibly trillions  of dollars were worried as well. If the local authorities in other parts of China did the same thing, they thought, a big chunk of their own wealth could end up with the government as well.What will happen after our land lease expires? asked Mr. Chen, 69, who with his wife holds a 70-year lease. I will be dead when the lease expires, but will I be able to give it to my son?Chinas erratic stock market and its strict limits on sending money overseas have prompted many Chinese families to invest in residential real estate. Chinas families have put nearly two-thirds of their wealth into housing, estimates Li Gan, a professor of economics at Texas A&M University who runs a widely read survey of Chinese households. Some own two or more homes and buy or sell them the way American investors play the stock market.That pot of household wealth is crucial to Chinas efforts to take its economy to the next level. As reliable sources of growth like exports and manufacturing falter, China is trying to turn its households into American-style consumers. Faith in their home savings would make them more likely to open their wallets.But even as it has pushed for increased homeownership, the Chinese Communist Party has done little to loosen its grip on the nations land. The party attacked private landlords during its rise to power, and when it took control, it nationalized all land, following the Soviet model. Although the death of Mao Zedong led to reforms that allowed people to own their own homes, the central government continued to retain title to the land, giving it a major lever in Chinas economy.Some experts say the central government cannot continue to serve as national landlord. Our country still believes in an ideology that is already outdated, said Mao Yushi, a prominent economist who previously directed the Unirule Institute of Economics, a Beijing research firm. The patriarch of public ownership, the Soviet Union, has collapsed already, but we are still holding onto public ownership.Giving land to the people would not be easy. Local governments in China do not have the power to levy taxes, so leasing land is one of the few ways they have to raise money.Allowing Chinese to own land could also concentrate wealth in the hands of a few, Mr. Mao said. So how would we tax those who end up owning the vast swath? he asked.In 2007, China moved to reassure homeowners by requiring local governments to renew 70-year leases automatically. Yet the law was silent on whether homeowners would have to pay for the renewal and what would happen to those with shorter leases.Chinas Legislature needs to resolve this issue, said Sun Yuhua, an associate researcher at the East China University of Political Science and Law. Otherwise, he said, it will trigger huge disputes.Uncertainties about land leases come at a time of broader concerns about the affordability of housing in China. Some smaller cities have gluts of unoccupied apartments, but housing prices have risen steadily in wealthy cities like Shanghai and Beijing.As the state-run Global Times said in a May 4 commentary, For millions of home buyers, after paying an already exorbitant house price in the overheated market, another hit to their savings will be hard to accept.Beijing is keeping a close eye on events in Wenzhou, a coastal city of eight million people in eastern China that was one of the first to set up private enterprise after China opened up its economy in the late 1970s. The governments land ministry sent an inspection team to Wenzhou in April, according to state media. National and local government officials declined to comment.At least three Wenzhou neighborhoods have been hit by government requests for money to renew land leases, including Henghe North, where Ms. Wang and Mr. Chen live. The Chens home is typical of the areas modest dwellings. Nestled on the third floor of a gray-tiled building, the apartment crams two bedrooms into 580 square feet.A blocky complex of buildings, Henghe North is bordered by a busy avenue lined with noodle stands, vegetable markets and other small shops. Trees and flower beds grow along the canal that abuts the development. Mr. Chen said local people pooled their money to build a community center designed like a Chinese temple.The unassuming neighborhood was turned upside down by Ms. Wangs discovery. Local apartment owners started checking their lease documents. Chinese reporters went door to door, especially in Ms. Wangs building. There were so many journalists here that she didnt want to talk to anyone, Mr. Chen said.Reached by telephone, a woman who identified herself as Ms. Wang said she was waiting to see how the government would resolve the problem. She declined to comment further.Property records in China are spotty, relatively new and unavailable to the public. According to her neighbors and local media, Ms. Wang and her family bought her 860-square-foot apartment three years ago for 1.4 million renminbi, or about $210,000 at todays exchange rates.Several blocks away, residents of another affected neighborhood, Shuixin, wondered what would happen when they tried to sell their apartments.People dont know what to do, said Ge Qingchuan, a retired real estate agent who stopped his motor scooter to talk. No one paid attention to land leases, but now there are problems.For example, he added, if you are buying a new apartment and using your current apartment, with a 20-year lease, as collateral to borrow money, you wont be able to do so. If the banks see your land lease is expiring, they wont lend you money."}
{"text": "Yesterday, Dior Beautys creative director Peter Philips wanted to juxtapose the richness of the 2017 cruise show show with a graphic beauty look. In this historically rich venue, we didnt want the girls to look like they were visiting a museum, he said, referring to Blenheim Palace, a sweeping 18th-century home just outside of London. The clothes  shown in the Palaces famously long library, which houses 10,000 books and portraits by Joshua Reynolds and John Singer Sargent  didnt shy away from opulence either. The collection is very elaborate so we wanted to do something on the face that was calm and linear to balance it out. He applied a dark, reddish-chocolate eye shadow from the Dior 5 Couleurs Skyline Edition n506 Parisian Sky palette, and packed it up to the eyebrows. (The brown shadow was a nod to the collection, which featured the same tone.)He kept the skin radiant and glowing with Diorskin Forever Foundation, and sculpted the face with Diorblush Light & Contour Sculpting Stick Duo, keeping the edges soft by blending it into the foundation. I wanted beautiful, glowy skin and intense dark eyes, he said. Lips were kept natural with just a hint of sheen. We wanted to do something really graphic on top, then it stops and becomes natural.And in a well-timed move, it was announced yesterday morning that the model Bella Hadid, who walked in the show, had been appointed the new ambassador of Dior Beauty. What I like about Bella isnt only that shes a gorgeous girl but when you look at her, she has this diva attitude on the red carpet, Philips said of Hadid. But at the same time she has this spontaneity with social media that doesnt look forced. Give David Beckham a football and its the same as what she does with social media. It comes natural  its a talent.In keeping with that idea, the hairstylist Guido Palau slicked the hair back on top with Redken Hardware gel, and then let it fall naturally. As it was a resort collection, we decided the girls should look like they just combed their hair back after a shower or swim, he said. Its a little masculine but in a very elegant way."}
{"text": "Nanette Rainone, who as a reporter and programmer at the New York radio station WBAI in the late 1960s and early 70s created some of the first programs dedicated to feminism and womens issues, died on May 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.The cause was complications of breast cancer, her son, Bruno Blumenfeld, said.Ms. Rainone (pronounced ray-KNOWN) was a volunteer at the station in 1969 when she developed the idea for Womankind, a feminist news and information radio show that included interviews.At the time, feminism was struggling to earn a place in left-wing politics, where radical ideas still coexisted with sexist attitudes. Ms. Rainone hoped to overcome this paradox, taking a point of view shaped by her membership in groups like the Feminists and New York Radical Feminists.She soon added Electra Rewired, a program produced entirely by women for women. It was broadcast live at night and ran until dawn, with listeners calling in to discuss the topics addressed by the host, Liza Cowan, and her guests.In late 1970, Ms. Rainone came up with a third program, Consciousness Raising, in which seven regular guests gathered at the WBAI studio in Manhattan once a week to talk about topics such as marriage, divorce, housework and sexuality.Ms. Rainone edited the talk down to 45 minutes, broadcast it on Fridays at noon and let listeners call in to express their opinions for another 45 minutes. The idea, she once wrote, was simple: to present a group of women honestly discussing their lives.In 1971, she became the head programmer for WBAI. She was a producer of The Sex Programme, which encouraged listeners to call in and seek advice from sex therapists, and of a radio series on womens diaries.Nanette Rainone was born on Dec. 4, 1942, in Queens, where she grew up in Middle Village. Her father, Massimo, was a printer. Her mother, the former Anna Solomita, worked as a bookkeeper. On their first date, they had attended the musical No, No Nanette, which inspired the name they would give their daughter.Ms. Rainone attended Newtown High School in Queens and in 1965 earned a degree in English from Queens College, where she was active in leftist groups like the Student Peace Union and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.She pursued graduate studies, but after marrying Ralph Blumenfeld, a reporter for The New York Post, in 1966, she left school to work as a clerk at Life magazine. The marriage ended in divorce. Her second husband, Harvey W. Schultz, New York Citys commissioner of environmental protection during the last of Mayor Edward I. Kochs three terms, died in 2007.In addition to her son, Ms. Rainone is survived by a brother, Martin; three stepsons, Jason, Matthew and Daniel Schultz; a granddaughter; and three step-grandchildren.After leaving WBAI in 1976 Ms. Rainone worked on the mayoral campaign of Representative Bella Abzug and became the communications director for Howard Golden, the Brooklyn borough president. While in Mr. Goldens office, she created the Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn  now called BRIC, for Brooklyn Information and Culture  to present free performances and cultural programs as a way of attracting visitors to the borough.As the funds president, an office she held until 2002, she organized the annual Celebrate Brooklyn! festival in Prospect Park and played a key role in creating the Rotunda Gallery on Clinton Street, which showcases the artwork of Brooklyn residents, as well as Brooklyn Community Access Television (now called the Brooklyn Public Network).In the mid-1970s, when radical politics seemed to be losing some of its fervor and sense of direction, Ms. Rainone reaffirmed her faith in WBAIs mission in its program guide: The station stands  having been the first to present womens programing  as the only media institution which has not virtually abandoned the questions raised by the movements since the demonstrators left the streets."}
{"text": "When Juan Carlos Prez told his friends he was going to study to be a teacher, they dismissed his intentions: They told me: Whats the point? Youre not going to be able to teach.He was an undocumented immigrant who crossed the border from Mexico and arrived in New York at age 11, with his younger brother and his mother.They were right  initially.But on Wednesday, a rule passed by the New York State Board of Regents in February will go into effect, allowing certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to apply for professional teaching certificates and for licenses in 57 professions. Soon, nurses, social workers, architects and engineers who came from places as disparate as Dubai, South Korea and Ecuador will enter the citys work force, newly licensed. Medical students now have a way to fulfill their ambitions.Its just a relief, Mr. Prez, 30, said last week in his classroom at the International High School at Union Square, where students hail from 49 countries. I feel like Im always on borrowed time because I dont know whats going to happen next.The states rule change comes after a 2015 decision that allowed the licensing of an undocumented New York lawyer, Cesar Vargas. An appellate panel of the State Supreme Court ruled last June that Mr. Vargas should be allowed to practice law because he was authorized to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.The program allows immigrants under 31 who were brought here by their parents to live and work legally in the United States and be temporarily protected from deportation.Janet Calvo, a law professor at the City University of New York who provided the legal analysis for the Vargas case, sent a memo persuading the Regents that because of Vargas and similar case law, there should be no bar to noncitizens applying for other licenses.Undocumented students are already eligible to attend state and city universities.New York has invested educational resources in these students, and it made no sense not to get the return on the investment, said Natalie Gomez-Velez, the director of the law schools Center on Latino/a Rights and Equality, also a party to the memo.According to Ms. Gomez-Velez, California and Nebraska also allow immigrants in the deferred action program to get professional licenses.It is unclear how many people in New York will be affected by the rule change because schools and the state do not keep track of who is undocumented.Mr. Prez came to the United States in 1997. His father had left six months earlier when his business was failing in rural Tlaxcala. The family settled in Corona, Queens. Mr. Prez attended a bilingual middle school there, but did not speak much English. It was not until he got to high school, struggling with the language and coursework at International High School at LaGuardia Community College, that his teachers encouraged him.He went on to graduate from Adelphi University with a bachelors degree in math and then, in 2008, with a masters degree in education.But after becoming the first in his family to graduate from college, Mr. Prez could work only at restaurants because of his lack of legal status. He was a busboy at Buddha Bar in the meatpacking district.After earning his masters, he could only get a job passing out business cards for a car service company. He taught English as a Second Language for a Jackson Heights immigrant rights organization for three years. I thought that was the closest I might come to the classroom, Mr. Prez said.Then the Obama administration announced the deferred action program in June 2012, and the following April Mr. Prez became a substitute teacher at the Union Square school, with a temporary license.Even without the hope of a permanent license at the time, Mr. Prez said, I had already waited five years to be in the classroom. I wanted to teach. Under the rules in force, he could have taught for a maximum of five years.But at the beginning of 2015, he feared for his job. He had applied for the renewal of his work authorization and, weeks before his deadline, the government had not responded.His Spanish-speaking students especially sensed Mr. Prezs distress.When I told them why, Mr. Prez said last week, tearing up when recalling their concern, they said: What can we do? Can we write letters to someone? We cannot lose you as a teacher, you understand us. You know what weve gone through.Two weeks later, the renewal came through.This year, he is advising one of the schools top students, who is undocumented and seeking a way to afford college. His students have cheered him running the New York City Marathon and recently welcomed him as a chaperone at the school prom.He has a deep personal commitment to the work because he identifies so strongly with his students, said Joe Luft, the executive director of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, which operates the 15 international high schools in New York City.Immigration law had created a paradox. To fill the demand for teachers in the so-called STEM fields  science, technology engineering and math  the city has at times had to hire teachers from overseas, Mr. Luft said. But, he added, foreign-born candidates who were raised in New York often had to stay on the sidelines.I think its a long overdue and much-needed recognition of the fact that we have a pool of potential educators weve failed to tap into, Mr. Luft said.As soon as the school year ends, Mr. Prez intends to submit his application for his professional license. He is already attending classes for his certification test. His reassurances to his students may soon carry more weight.I tell them, I remember what it was like when I was in your place, Mr. Prez said. I know it seems really tough, and sometimes impossible, but it can be done."}
{"text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.  Christian Pulisic and his father, Mark, were video chatting on Sunday from separate continents. They had a lot of things to discuss.The previous night in Kansas City, Kan., Pulisic, at 17 years 212 days, had become the youngest player to score a goal for the United States national team  at least in the institutional memory of American soccer and for certain since 1990, when the federation began stringent record keeping. Mark Pulisic had watched the game from Verl, Germany, reclined on a hotel bed with an iPad in his hands. As he fought off sleep in the middle of the night, the sight of his son celebrating had had the surreal feeling of a dream.Their conversation the next day, though, turned out to be short. Everything was awesome, his son told him, but actually, he added, he needed to run. He had to go eat with the guys.Typical teenager, Mark Pulisic said later, laughing. Not too interested in divulging information to his parents.In many ways, Christian Pulisic is an everyday American teenager. He plays Ping-Pong and pickup basketball to kill time. He loves LeBron James and listens to Justin Bieber. He has a few more inches to grow (he presumably hopes). He has dabbed in public.But the developments in the last six months of his life have been rather extraordinary. Since January, he has worked his way into the first team of Borussia Dortmund, one of the top clubs in Europe. In April, he scored his first Bundesliga goal. A week later, he scored his second. By then, he had already made his first appearance for the United States senior team, and this month he will be on the American squad when it opens the Copa Amrica Centenario tournament against Colombia on Friday night at Levis Stadium.That combination of obvious talent and tangible early success, in turn, has begun a familiar American swirl of hype, expectation and apprehension.The game in the United States, while embraced in greater numbers every year, remains without a universally talismanic personality. Soccer, more than many other team sports, welcomes young prodigies into the ranks of its adult players. There has thus long been a discernible yearning in the collective mind of American fans for a young superstar to carry that mantle as the One, and Pulisics emergence has started those conversations anew.It is a process that has made people close to him uneasy.Were just accustomed to having that guy  whether in basketball, baseball  that superstar in a global stage, said Bill Belcher, who played professional indoor soccer with Mark Pulisic and has invited Christian to train with the Harrisburg City Islanders, the U.S.L. team he now coaches. Any time a young kid comes along who looks like he has potential, we want to anoint him as The One. But I dont know if its fair to any kid to heap that on him at such a young age.Lessons learned from young players of the past have made many people hesitate to place expectations on teenage players. But with Pulisic, it has not stopped the chatter altogether.Last week, Thomas Rongen, a former United States under-20 coach, told The New York Daily News, I really think that Pulisic is going to be the best player the United States has ever produced. SB Nation produced an online video that suggested, Christian Pulisic might be U.S. Soccers best young talent ever. Pulisic shared the video on his Facebook page on Saturday morning, adding an emoji of a smiley face wearing sunglasses.Friends, family members, coaches and teammates have lauded Pulisics level head and humble attitude. They say he has maintained a quiet, deferential presence around his older teammates, but they have embraced him as a colleague  even if Kyle Beckerman, a 34-year-old midfielder, could only laugh when asked what it was like to have a teammate half his age.After the game Saturday in Kansas City, a 4-0 win over Bolivia, United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said of Pulisic: Hes grounded. He knows that he has a long way to go. But he has no fear.Pulisics confidence emerged from a young age. Growing up in Hershey, Pa., he generally played two years above his age. When he trained as a 14-year-old with Bechers team, it was with men in their 20s and 30s. He rarely dominated games, but his physical and psychological limits were constantly pushed.My dad taught me, like, no matter what, when I go out and play against these bigger players, just to be myself, Pulisic said this week. I knew that I was good enough and that I had the ability to. I never shy away from anyone, and I dont think anyone should.Even before his teenage years, Pulisic could play the ball with either foot and had an innate sense of movement. But he was always small for his age. The early teenage years can be a worrisome period for soccer players and the coaches monitoring them, and Pulisic faced the normal questions: Will he grow? Will his muscles develop? Will the developments manifest as strength, or clumsiness?A timely growth spurt as he was training in U.S. Soccers youth residency program helped attract the attention of overseas clubs, including Dortmund.Once he got that quickness and burst, it really brought out all the ability he already had, said Steve Klein, a family friend who helped coach Pulisic at the club and youth national team levels.In 2014, Pulisic and his father moved to Dortmund, where they live now in a four-bedroom townhouse. (Mark Pulisic took a youth coaching position at Dortmund when Christian signed there as a 16-year-old last January.) His sister, stepbrother and mother, Kelley, still live in the United States. Pulisic is too young to drive in Germany, so he gets rides to practice from his father and takes the train around the city. After two years of daily lessons, and games of pickup basketball and H-O-R-S-E at Dortmunds training site, he speaks German conversationally.Dortmund has been conscious of controlling Pulisics media exposure this spring, even as his play began to attract international attention, and Mark Pulisic was happy to learn this week that U.S. Soccer was limiting his sons media obligations to postgame interviews.But the attention may keep growing, particularly if Pulisic plays well at the Copa Amrica, where he is expected, at least in the early going, to provide Klinsmann with a spark off the bench. Already, he has showed flashes of the subtle traits that capture fans imaginations, and hinted at bigger things: a feathery first touch, elastic ankles, rhythmic running and a willingness to mix it up.Michael Bradley, the United States captain, said: Its easy to see right away that he has some special qualities, in terms of his ability to move with the ball, to be light on his feet, to put defenders on the wrong foot, to play in that spot out wide but be a threat in different ways, in terms of his movement, in terms of playing from out to in. I think we all have to understand that hes still very young, and theres going to be the normal ups and downs that go with that, that are there with any player.Pulisic received a loud cheer on Saturday when he entered the Bolivia game for the final 20 minutes. Fans behind one of the goals began chanting his name before he even touched the ball. His goal, in the 69th minute, was a simple finish and, in a blowout game, largely trivial. But the entire team jogged over to congratulate Pulisic as he celebrated. His forehead came up only to the shoulders of most of his teammates.After the game, he stood for a short interview in which he played down his first goal.When he was finished, he walked over to sign autographs for a small group of waiting fans.Typical teenager stuff."}
{"text": "It started when I was a teenager. I became really interested in playing with makeup in the same way I would with any art supply, says the artist Erica Prince, 30, as she leads me up the stairs to In Limbo. The airy Williamsburg apartment-cum-gallery has been transformed into a temporary beauty parlor where, through June 5, Prince is seeking participants for the Transformational Makeover Salon. Each brave soul visits the gallery alone, and after a consultation, receives a new look. For the artist, who typically works in drawing and sculpture, this sort of intimate performance is a departure from her usual practice. The idea of doing a relational project really scared me at first, but its been amazing to get away from my studio and out of my solitary conversation with myself, she says. Its an exercise in being present.Before the makeover begins, I fill out a questionnaire the size of a diner place mat, noting my eye color (blue), least favorite thing about myself (Im terrible at posing for photos) and the book Im currently reading (The Story of My Teeth). Although the form asks for a few faults and flaws, Prince emphasizes that the goal of the makeover isnt to make me look my best. Instead, its an opportunity to consider my everyday self from a distance  more Mrs. Doubtfire than My Fair Lady, in movie-makeover terms. I like to preface these things by saying its not about beauty, its an opportunity to experiment, she assures me. Theres some relationship to self-betterment, but in an indirect, abstract way.Prince asks me to take a before selfie and leaves to give me some privacy while I pose, reminding me of a doctor ducking out of an exam room so I can change into a paper gown. (My selfies are a little awkward.) Then, as instructed, I sit in the salon chair, facing away from the mirror.As Prince cleans my face with a tissue, I tell her that my boyfriend often says I look better without makeup, in a tone I hope conveys that his compliment is a little lame. Prince has heard many variations of this story over the course of the project. These confidences are the currency of the salon, and participants in the project are eager to share their beauty confessions. Another common complaint is parents who felt that makeup was tantamount to superficiality, not something smart people ought to enjoy. That wasnt the case in Princes childhood home, where her mother was often visited by the Mary Kay lady. The sales calls left Prince with a vivid impression of the powerful role cosmetics could play in constructing an identity: Our Mary Kay lady had a picture of herself without any makeup on inside her display. Honestly, she looked terrible, she says. I remember looking back and forth between her and the picture and thinking, Thats what you really look like, but this is how youre portraying yourself? Amazing!Prince applies creams and powders from a product-filled trolley that once stored her more traditional art supplies. Ive long ago lost track of how many layers of color have been used, but my face feels perceptibly heavier. Transformational Makeovers can last anywhere from a few minutes for a small appearance adjustment to over an hour for a full face of makeup. So far, almost 30 women and men have participated (including makeovers during the projects earlier iteration in 2014). For one guy, I just switched the part in his hair from left to right, Prince tells me as she traces my eyelid with dark pencil. Actually, it was a huge change for him.Suddenly its time for the final touches: a wig cap, which makes me feel oddly glamorous, topped with a glossy, shoulder-length wig. As the big reveal approaches, I start to get nervous. Everybody responds differently, says Prince. Some people are really quiet, some people start laughing because theyre in a state of shock. Often people feel like theyre not looking at themselves anymore.I tell myself I wont gasp and cover my mouth when I look in the mirror, but I do it anyway. The extra moment it takes me to recognize my own reflection is profoundly disorienting. Im looking at a stranger. Prince has broken a cardinal rule of makeup: bilateral symmetry. My face is unevenly divided between two clashing shades of foundation, and my lipstick switches abruptly from blue-black to crimson. My eyebrows are definitely not twins  theyre not even third cousins. The overall effect is part punk, part glam and undeniably fierce.As I try out my best rock-and-roll sneer for the after selfie, I realize how boring and safe my daily look has become. My devotion to all things sheer, natural and minimal now seems less refined and more like a failure of imagination. You might hate this, but at least it will be an experience that helps you gain perspective, Prince assures me. My goal is that people walk down the street afterward slightly flustered and more aware of their surroundings. But I dont hate it: I borrow the wig and wear it on the G train, all the way home."}
{"text": "Salesforce.com is fluffing up its cloud business, but at a high cost.Marc Benioffs online-software company has agreed to pay $2.8 billion for the e-commerce specialist Demandware. That may add some zip to slowing growth while bolstering a heated rivalry with the old-school Oracle. But the price includes a high premium of nine times estimated revenue.Software that operates in the cloud  essentially large servers accessible through the internet  has a lot to offer. Its quick and relatively cheap to set up, easily accommodates additional users and capacity and is updated continuously. As a result, more big businesses are switching to it from traditional software based on individual computers. That is a major reason Salesforce revenue has been growing about 25 percent each year.The problem is that investors may be looking for more, given the companys $57 billion market capitalization. Margins are improving, but Salesforce is still barely profitable. Acquiring Demandware could refocus shareholders on growth, buying the company a bit more time.Online retailing is a hot area. Even with the likes of Amazon booming, it still accounts for less than 10 percent of total sales in the United States. That leaves plenty of opportunity for Demandware, whose specialty is helping the likes of Adidas, Brooks Brothers and Clarins set up shop online.Plugging the company into a much larger enterprise could help it grow. Salesforce paid almost as much for the cloud-marketing firm ExactTarget three years ago, and that company has by all accounts expanded significantly since, though its revenue isnt stated separately.The Demandware deal also involves a bit of one-upmanship, helping Mr. Benioff stick it to its long-time rival Oracle and its boss, Larry Ellison. Oracle has been caught somewhat flat-footed by the rise of cloud software, and Salesforce is aiming for a substantial edge in retailing software.The purchase price is an aggressive bet on growth. If Demandware doesnt deliver over several years, Salesforce will have wasted a chunk of its cash. Yet Mr. Benioff has made such bets before  and won.Whats more, many fast-growing, cash-burning, privately held cloud firms have recently fallen in value. That could whet Mr. Benioffs appetite for acquisitions even further."}
{"text": "TILAURAKOT, Nepal  Standing at the edge of a six-foot trench, an archaeologist from Nepals government peered down at a row of round holes  new evidence, he said, that below our feet lay a 2,500-year-old thatch-and-timber city where the Buddha lived until the age of 29.The archaeologist said he was thinking about the future, when thousands of pilgrims would be climbing down from rows of buses every year to see the ruins in the Nepalese town of Tilaurakot. We are trying to compel them to spend money here, he said.Similar enthusiasm could be detected about 17 miles away on the Indian side of the border, where India invites tourists to visit another site it claims are the ruins of the Buddhas childhood home. Asked about the Nepali site, an Indian archaeologist sniffed. The question doesnt arise, he said.Begun in the glory days of the British Raj, this archaeological tug of war has remained unresolved for more than a century, of concern to virtually nobody. But changes are coming to the baking orange plains that straddle Nepal and India.Buddhist history is an ever-more-serious business. China and India, two giants maneuvering for control in South Asia, have identified Buddhism as an instrument of soft power. In an area where, for centuries, Buddhism all but disappeared, a range of global stakeholders are investing in infrastructure to accommodate throngs of future pilgrims. Indias prize attraction is Bodh Gaya, the site where, it is believed, the Buddha attained enlightenment.Nepal, increasingly aligned with Beijing, jealously guards its claim to the Buddhas birth and early life.It is a matter of surprise that even today, in this 21st century, 2,500 years later than the time of Buddhas birth, that its still a little bit confused, said the Nepali prime minister, K. P. Sharma Oli, at a government-sponsored Buddhist conference in Kathmandu last month.Of the conferences 385 delegates, more than 300 were Chinese; Indias delegation numbered nine. When Mr. Oli complained about outsiders trying to encroach on Nepals status as the Buddhas home, it was quite clear whom he meant.There are people, a few people, perhaps, who are deliberately trying to create a situation of confusion, he said.Buddhist lore has it that Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, grew up within the luxurious setting of his fathers palace in the city of Kapilavastu, carefully guarded from any exposure to human suffering. When, at 29, Siddhartha stepped outside, he was confronted with the sight of the aged, the diseased and the dead, an experience that shook him so powerfully that he left his fathers home the following day, embracing life as an ascetic.Until the time of the British Raj, there was little serious effort to determine where these events occurred. A powerful Hindu revival had rolled over the plains, extinguishing virtually all trace of the religion that had begun there. Then came the European Indologists, armed with the only shreds of evidence available: the accounts of Chinese monks who traveled the Buddhas path in the fifth and seventh centuries A.D.By the time the British withdrew, digs at two different locations had both declared victory. The modern border between Nepal and India had also come into existence, and the two claims, supported by fragmentary evidence and fired by nationalism, hardened into a cranky rivalry.Engulfed in complete darkness, the scholars made a beginning in the direction of locating Kapilavastu like a wild-goose chase, K. M. Srivastava, of the Archaeological Survey of India, wrote in a memoir of his expedition to the Indian town of Piprahwa.His discoveries, he wrote, a bit huffily, so infuriated a particular set of scholars that they derived pleasure in indulging in the most unparliamentary language questioning the identity of Kapilavastu.The Indian consensus has held  at least in India, where tour operators market Piprahwa as the place where the Buddha spent his childhood grappling with the overwhelming and puzzling problem of human existence. This spring, Indias minister of culture opened a museum there, displaying evidence, mostly in the form of inscriptions on ancient seals, that was said to prove it was the true site of the Buddhas childhood home.Across the border in Tilaurakot, a Nepali-British team supported by Unesco has been plowing ahead with its own hypothesis: that an Indian-organized expedition in the late 1960s had simply stopped digging too early.The leader of that Indian expedition, Debala Mitra, uncovered traces of a sprawling brick city, but she said it could not have been Kapilavastu because it had been built hundreds of years after the Buddhas life. Last year, the Unesco-backed team cut down through the brick structures Ms. Mitra had found and discovered a second fortification whose ramparts were made of clay.Then they dug even farther, slowing their work to a crawl. They were watching for cylindrical depressions in the earth: evidence that under the clay fort had once stood timber fence posts, perhaps for so long that the wood had decayed, leaving a shell of earth behind.Six feet below the earths surface, they found them. The traces of hardened earth inside those holes, when analyzed in a laboratory, dated from the sixth century B.C., meaning they would have stood during the Buddhas lifetime.In late April, a scorching heat settled on the plains, and workmen used wheelbarrows to refill trenches, shutting down the expedition for the hot season. Placards were erected, announcing that it would have been on this roadway that Siddhartha traveled on toward the Eastern Gate before renouncing his princely life. A wooden walkway was also built so that pilgrims who prostrated themselves would not become covered in mud.It was a bit hard to imagine a crowd there; the forest was empty except for a young boy, who was amusing himself by throwing stones. But Ram Bahadur Kunwar, from the Nepalese Department of Archaeology, paced the site of a central walled complex and spoke of great hopes.It is still a mystery, because we have not opened it up, he said. But when we do, I think that this structure will tell the history of Kapilavastu.Others share his excitement. The Asian Development Bank is helping to finance a $54 million upgrade of the international airport close to the Nepalese town of Lumbini, the Buddhas birthplace. The upgraded airport, when it is completed in 2030, will accommodate 760,000 passengers a year. Lumbini is about 16 miles from Tilaurakot.It seems that many of those visitors are expected to come from China, which is experiencing a Buddhist revival: Tour guides are picking up Mandarin, new hotels are hiring Chinese chefs, and the local authorities are planning to erect a statue of the ninth-century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim whose travel journal established Nepal as the Buddhas birthplace. On a recent afternoon, a gaggle of women from Chengdu were clambering back onto a plane after meditating for five minutes under the branches of a tree near the Buddhas birthplace.Sunanda Sakyaputra, a Buddhist monk who had traveled to Tilaurakot to meditate, said the site of the ruined palace, a place where the Buddha was not happy, gave him a profound sense of the futility of human suffering. Asked about the town on the Indian side, he snorted.That is wrong, very wrong, he said. All things. India thinks all things are hers. Why?"}
{"text": "Its a year of anniversaries for Lizzie Grubman, the archetypal celebrity publicist known equally for making friends, enemies and headlines.Ten years of marriage. Twenty years since the founding of her namesake firm, Lizzie Grubman Public Relations & Management. And 15 since the Hamptons auto accident that dominated the tabloid news cycle for a summer, turning her into one of the most notorious women in New York.Shortly after midnight on a July morning in 2001, Ms. Grubman ignited a tabloid firestorm when she backed her fathers Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. into a crowd outside the Conscience Point Inn, a Hamptons nightclub, injuring 16 people.P.R. Gals Nightmare  Her SUV Plows Into Hamptons Club Crowd and Hard Fall for Rising P.R. Star; Crash Shatters Grubmans World blared two typical New York Post headlines. It may be hard to believe now, but before Sept. 11, 2001, Ms. Grubman was one of the biggest news stories in the region.George Rush, a former gossip columnist who covered the accident and its aftermath for The Daily News, said the story played out as a larger parable about class conflict.For many readers, Lizzie was a vicious princess who was overdue for her comeuppance, he said.Now 45, Ms. Grubman has stayed out of the spotlight for a decade. Mellowed by marriage and two children, and energized by her firms expansion into talent management and television development, she feels ready to talk about the remarkable roller coaster of her life, and lay to rest the ghosts of that infamous summer.I do a lot of damage control, thats what I love in P.R., Ms. Grubman said on a recent Sunday, sitting in her large corner office in the Flatiron district, which showcases Rear Window style views over a uniquely Manhattan hodgepodge of apartments, construction sites and artists studios. Just think of Olivia Pope in Scandal, but for Hollywood.Her full client list is confidential (I do divorces, I do arrests and cop situations, when someone is resigning or getting fired, she said), but her current publicity-seeking roster includes the TV personalities Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Carole Radziwill, the rising hip-hop producer C4 and the pop singer Inas X.I think Ive matured, I think Ive grown up, said Ms. Grubman, dressed in a new-season Prada sundress and chunky platform heels, accessorized by a Givenchy Antigona black leather tote, whose oversize zipper teeth made it look like a document shredder for money. Living a private, nonpublic life is a much happier life.Ms. Grubman was flanked by her sons, Harry, 9, and Jack, 7, and her husband, Chris Stern, executive creative director for the talent and management agency WME IMG.Mr. Stern is a chatty, gentle man with a fondness for Loro Piana cashmere sweaters. When together, the couple bring to mind a really expensive pair of new stiletto heels and the protective velvet bag that comes with them in the box.Chris is my rock, said Ms. Grubman, pulling him close. Hes made me into a different person, and my children have, too. Theres been some rough times.The family divides its time between their East 61st Street apartment (a triple combine duplex) and a five-bedroom weekend home in Sag Harbor, N.Y., both designed by Mr. Stern. Its a life filled with children, grandparents and all the trappings of professional success.Yet even now, with a happy home life and thriving business, Ms. Grubman has difficulty discussing the events of summer 2001, when everything changed.Elizabeth Stacey Grubman was born in 1971 to Yvette and Allen Grubman, a man whom Newsweek once described as perhaps the music industrys wealthiest and most powerful attorney with superstar clients like Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, U2 and Sean (Puffy) Combs.The trials and tribulations that she went through, just like everybody else has gone through, she came out in a way that Im very, very proud of, Mr. Grubman said. Every so often, Ill bump into someone and theyll say, Oh, youre Lizzies father. I get a kick out of that.Mr. Grubman was a famously bad student, a trait he passed on to his daughter. She had brief tours at four New York City private schools, including Horace Mann, Lenox and Dwight (my social life became a little bit more important than studies, she said), followed by a single semester at Northeastern University.It was in Boston that Ms. Grubman started promoting nightclubs and the public relations career that she pursued upon returning to New York.In 1995, she went to work for Nadine Johnson, an established P.R. agent known for her fashionable roster of art world and luxury clients. But the relationship quickly soured, and she left after a year to start her own firm, amid rumors that she had taken with her Ms. Johnsons list, industry jargon for proprietary business contacts, which are jealously guarded.Nadines list is not valuable, its only valuable to Nadine, Ms. Grubman said. I respect Nadine, I have nothing bad to say about her. She clearly does not like me. (Ms. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.)In 1998, Ms. Grubman was one of three influential young female publicists featured on the cover of New York magazine with the headline Power Girls. The article announced Ms. Grubmans arrival as a personality in her own right.It inaugurated a golden age for her business, but her tough-as-nails persona and moneyed background alienated some observers even as it attracted huge names to her client list, including entertainers like Jay Z, Gloria Estefan and Mr. Combs, and modish restaurants and nightclubs of fin de sicle New York, like Moomba, Spy Bar and Asia de Cuba.She was there by my side and protected me when I was young and just getting into the spotlight, Britney Spears, a former client for whom Ms. Grubman still occasionally consults, wrote in a text message from Los Angeles. I was so grateful to know that Lizzie always looked out for me.But the article also ruffled feathers, with its depiction of the subjects as privileged party girls, an early backlash to the princess image that would attend Ms. Grubman for years to come.I get it, she said of the resentment at the time. It would irritate me, too.But worse was on the way.On July 6, 2001, Ms. Grubman received the devastating news that her mother had late-stage ovarian cancer. (She died three weeks later, at age 58.)In an emotional state, Ms. Grubman nevertheless went out that Friday evening to attend July 4 weekend festivities in the Hamptons. After a party at the home of Alex and Alexandra von Furstenberg, she drove the black Mercedes S.U.V. to the Conscience Point Inn, then a fashionable Southampton nightclub.Sometime after midnight, she got into an argument with a doorman who insisted she move her car. Instead, the vehicle lurched backward into a line of waiting patrons, injuring 16 people.Months of front-page denouncements and $100 million worth of lawsuits (which were quietly settled) followed, culminating with a 38-day stay in the Suffolk County jail. Ms. Grubman publicly apologized to the victims outside the courtroom in which she pleaded guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges, but she has otherwise declined to discuss the incident.But her days of being tabloid fodder were not over. In 2005, she starred in an MTV reality show about her professional life, called PoweR Girls, which flopped with critics and viewers, lasting six episodes. (Ms. Grubman has mixed feelings about it: I think I gave away a lot of trade secrets, and I glamorized P.R. in a way that people didnt understand.)That same year, Page Six announced her relationship with Mr. Stern, who was married at the time to Joyce Sevilla, who happened to work for Lizzie Grubman P.R. The ensuing divorce was acrimonious (as were the human-resources issues), but it freed the new couple to marry in March 2006.The gossip columns continued to needle, and it was an encounter with aggressive paparazzi that convinced Ms. Grubman that she needed to remove herself and her family from the spotlight.One day, were out walking, and these photographers are out for my son, and he was so scared, she said. It hurt him so badly. We had problems in preschool with him taking class pictures.Now, hes O.K., she said, watching Harry gambol over her office furniture. Now he has his own Instagram.If Ms. Grubmans critics were hoping she would collapse under the sheer weight of the schadenfreude directed at her, they will be disappointed.In her stylishly decorated office, surrounded by family, she seems closer to the having it all work-life balance promoted by tech industry mom-bosses like the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg and the Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer.Ms. Grubman rises at 5 a.m., wakes her children at 6:30 and works from her office between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Back home, she balances work calls and family time (Mr. Stern is the cook) until a 9 p.m. bedtime.Jack, the younger son, who seemed completely at ease in her office, was asked to describe his mother. She buys us stuff, he said. And she talks on the phone a lot.(Ms. Grubman laughed it off, but it seemed clear there would be some media training when he got home that night.)Amid the happy family din, however, there remains just a trace of sadness around the intertwined tragedies of her mothers death and the car accident that changed her life. When asked to reflect on that fateful night, her normally polite smile sets into a thin, flat line.That unfortunate night happened, which I prefer not to talk about, in respect to my children and family, and the people who were involved, she said.I never properly mourned my mother. Well leave it at that, you know why.In 2007, her husband decided to do something about it.Understanding that Lizzie had a really tough time with Mothers Day, Mr. Stern said, I decided, right after we had Harry, that I go to Barneys and walk around with a personal shopper and pick out the best shoes and the best handbags in the place, bring them to the apartment, and I proceeded to fill Harrys entire crib with all of these pretty special boxes of treats.It was piled high, he said. I just wanted to make it seem like Harry was giving her the gift.Ms. Grubman said, Hes changed Mothers Day for me, and hes helped me through it.The anecdote captures Ms. Grubmans uniquely contentious place in New Yorks pantheon of characters. Its a cherished and heartwarming memory for the family, but viewed from the outside, it will be perceived as overprivileged and materialistic enough to inspire a thousand mean tweets.Was Ms. Grubman prepared for such a social media response?Ive been there, she said, sounding momentarily battle weary. Ive been beaten, Ive been killed in the media. But at this point in my life, my family, my kids and my clients are the most important people to me."}
{"text": "In 1998, President Bill Clinton suggested a partial solution to help millions of Americans without health insurance: The country should let those 55 and older without employer coverage buy into the government Medicare system.A few weeks ago, Hillary Clinton brought the idea back. Its a proposal shes talked about before: It was part of her 2000 Senate campaign platform and an option she mentioned for health insurance expansion when she ran for president in 2008.But a lot has changed with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, leading several health policy experts to wonder whether a Medicare buy-in would be a welcome new option, or a confounding misfit.Medicare for more, as Ive been calling it, would require significant adjustments to the Obamacare new markets for regulated insurance, which are currently set up for everyone under 65. It would require a new system for calculating and awarding subsidies to low-income purchasers. It would probably require changes to Medicares standard package of benefits. And it runs the risk of destabilizing the Obamacare marketplaces, several of which are already somewhat precarious.A Medicare buy-in could well work, but it wouldnt easily coexist in post-Obamacare times the way it might have in the 1990s.It is an approach that is somewhat inconsistent with the Affordable Care Act, said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at the health care consulting firm Avalere Health, who recently published an initial analysis of the idea. That analysis found that the program could be an option for as many as 13 million Americans.The Clinton suggestion was raised in response to a voter question, and the campaign hasnt released any sort of formal plan. As a result, its hard to know how Medicare for more might actually work. Here are some important questions that would have to be resolved.Medicare is an incredibly popular program, providing health insurance for nearly all Americans 65 and older. But it actually wouldnt count as health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, because it has too many holes. Patients can be asked to pay basically unlimited out-of-pocket costs  Medicare asks them to pay a daily fee when they are in the hospital for a long time and 20 percent of the cost of doctors visits. For people who are very sick, those costs can add up to tens of thousands of dollars.For Americans under 65, insurance has to cover all catastrophic costs. No insurance plan sold in an Obamacare marketplace can ask its customers to pay more than $6,850 a year out of pocket for covered medical services.A Medicare buy-in could provide an exception to the regular rules, and allow Medicare to include its usual gaps in coverage. But that would undermine the idea of the Obamacare marketplaces, where insurance plans are expected to compete on equal footing. A Medicare buy-in might include additional financial protections not offered to older Americans, but that would mean younger people would get a better version of Medicare than older ones.The one big advantage Medicare has over commercial insurance, however, is its broad network of doctors and hospitals. Most Obamacare plans limit their customers choice of medical providers. But every hospital and most doctors accept Medicare. That means that patients would have more choices with Medicare, even if they might incur higher costs if they need a lot of treatment.When Obamacare was being debated in Congress, many Democrats believed that new insurance markets should include a public option, a government insurance plan that would compete alongside private offerings. The proposal ended up being cut from the final legislation, but advocates thought the plan would help increase insurance choices for consumers and would help put downward pressure on prices for private companies, since the government plan would lack a profit motive.Advocates continue to make these arguments. Mrs. Clinton raised the Medicare for more idea when she was asked about strategies to drive down the cost of insurance for small business. The implication was that a public option might be more affordable than the current private options.Its really hard to know just what Medicare for more might cost compared with the private plans now on the market. (A lot depends on technical questions about how the prices would be calculated.) But the evidence from the current Obamacare market is that most private insurers are already feeling substantial pressure to keep prices low.Obamacare customers seem to be choosing the cheapest available plan each year, and a large number have been willing to switch plans each year to get a better deal, so plans need to be competitively priced to get customers. Many insurers appear to have priced their products so competitively that they lost money on them in the marketplaces first few years. Several have gone out of business or are bowing out of the markets because of losses. If the Medicare for more plan cost more than a typical marketplace plan, it probably wouldnt impose much new pricing discipline. If it cost less, it might drive more insurers out of the markets.This leads to another possible problem with Medicare for more: If successful, it will pull people out of the Obamacare markets. When the health law passed, everyone expected that some employers would stop offering health coverage and the new markets would be large. That hasnt happened, and, in some states, enrollment in Obamacare plans is substantially smaller than forecast. The smallness of the markets is one reason that insurers say the markets arent a great bet for them. It takes a certain amount of volume for it to be worth investing in this new population.There are optimists who think that Medicare for more could be tailored to help the Obamacare markets by making them more attractive to young customers who havent yet signed up. By pulling older Americans out of Obamacare, that theory goes, the remaining customers would be younger and healthier. Those younger, healthier customers would mean lower premiums for everyone. And lower premiums could bring in more young customers, completing a virtuous cycle.But, essentially, every person who buys Medicare will be one fewer person in the Obamacare markets, so new enrollees would have to make up that difference. Medicare for more would draw out only older Americans  Mrs. Clinton suggested that only people starting at age 50 or 55 would be eligible. But it could still make the remaining pool of people small enough that insurers simply leave the market. That could have the perverse effect of reducing choices and raising premiums.In the 1990s, a Medicare for more plan would have been nearly as simple as it sounded. In a world with the Affordable Care Act, expanding Medicare would require careful policy design to avoid being counterproductive."}
{"text": "If your digital photos are a mirror of your life, they may also serve as a reminder that there is only so much you can control and that at some point you just need to let things go.That was the lesson I learned after trying to create a step-by-step guide to organizing and storing smartphone photos, based on interviews with professional photographers and a week of testing multiple photo-management services and gadgets.I spent days experimenting with neurotic tagging systems, tedious backup processes and album management, and finally turned to Brian Christian, a computer scientist and philosopher, for advice.The healthiest approach to managing photos, it turns out, is a Zen one: to not deal with them much at all.Mr. Christian said photo organization illustrates a computer-science principle known as the search-sort trade-off. If you spend tons of time rummaging for a specific photo, then sorting photos may be worthwhile. But if you hunt for a picture infrequently, sorting may be a waste of time.If it would take you eight hours to tag all your friends, you should not undertake that until youve already wasted eight hours digging up photos of your friends, said Mr. Christian, co-author of Algorithms to Live By, a book about using algorithmic principles to improve your life.In other words, people need a photo-organization method that saves time  and that allows them to essentially throw out the need to sort and tag their enormous photo sprawl. So I tried several photo-management services and devices to determine what that method might be.Over a week, I tested three backup services with my iPhone photo library of about 8,000 images: Apples iCloud photo library, Dropbox and Google Photos, which automatically take your photos and store them in the cloud. I also tested two data backup devices from SanDisk and Synology.My conclusion: For smartphone shooters, the secret to photo nirvana is to take a deep breath and let Google back up and organize everything.Apples iCloud was straightforward. In the iPhones camera settings, flipping on iCloud Photo Library uploads all your photos to iCloud, which is accessible by Apple and Windows devices. Dropboxs photo-backup service uploads photos to your Dropbox folder, which is compatible with various devices like Windows PCs, iPhones and Android phones. For Google Photos, as soon as you set up the app, it starts backing everything up in Googles cloud service called Drive, also accessible on various devices. All three services took several days to back up my entire library over a Wi-Fi connection while I was asleep.Google Photos quickly set itself apart with its smarter auto-sorting features. It scans your photos and organizes them in several ways. For one, it can detect the face of a person and group all the photos of that person into an album, which you can name. With photos taken within a short time span, like your trip to a beach over the weekend, Google Photos might create a video montage or an album with a label like A weekend in San Francisco. The service also managed to identify pictures of items, like receipts and food, and group them into their own albums with labels.Dropbox and Apples photo services had auto-organizing features, but not the smarts of Googles service. Apples app groups photos into collections based on when and where photos were taken; it can also organize photos by faces, similar to Google. Dropbox uploads photos into a folder labeled Camera Uploads and labels each file by the date and time it was taken.Another benefit of Google Photos is its free offering is the most generous  enough to let you try out the service thoroughly before deciding whether to pay. The service offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images at no cost. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.In contrast, Apple offers five gigabytes free and thereafter charges at least $1 a month for 50 gigs; Dropbox offers two gigabytes of free storage before charging at least $10 a month for a terabyte.Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos, said the company built Google Photos to make it easy to keep, manage and share photos and videos. Apple and Dropbox did not immediately have comment.I also tested two physical devices for managing photos: the SanDisk iXpand, a small drive that plugs directly into the power port of an iPhone and automatically backs up photos, and Synologys DS216+II, a new disk storage system that connects to your internet at home to create a personal cloud.The iXpand device was deeply flawed  it tried to back up all my photos for six hours before the iPhone ran out of battery and the backup failed entirely. Synologys photo-management software backed up my photos quickly and had some features like face and location tagging, but organizing photo albums still required lots of manual labor.SanDisk said the issue I experienced was a known problem affecting a small number of devices and that an app update would be released next week to fix the bug. A Synology spokeswoman said that with its network-attached storage systems, customers could back up a broad array of media on a private cloud.In the end, Google Photos solves multiple problems: It handles organization, making the search-sort trade-off minimal. It creates a backup of photos, so you can free up space on your smartphone while safeguarding pictures in case the device is lost or stolen.Once all your photos are on Google Photos, they need not live on the phone. Unfortunately, there is no quick way to delete thousands of photos. I plugged my iPhone into a Mac, imported my older photos and checked the box that says Delete items after import. Then I deleted them all from the computer. (In the future, it will be easier to delete smaller batches straight off the phone.)What about blurry, unwanted images? The most important lesson of Google Photos is to stop thinking of the digital photo album like a physical scrapbook. With a traditional photo album, you would spend time flipping through pages before landing on the right photo.With Google Photos, you can treat it like a giant searchable junk drawer: You can simply open the Google Photos app or Google Drive, type in a keyword for what you want to see, pull up that photo and ignore everything else. You can make some changes here and there  like renaming or adding photos to albums  but otherwise, why bother?One caveat: The Zen approach does not apply to those with professional cameras. For professional photographers, some organization is a plus and Google Photos and cloud services are not ideal because large photos would take too long to upload.Ben Long, a professional photographer in San Francisco, said he diligently tagged his photos with keywords using Adobes Lightroom app to make them easy to find later.I put tagging up there with flossing and stretching: things you know youre supposed to do and theyre really a drag to do, but you just get in the habit of it, he said.For the rest of us, theres another reason to not bother deleting photos in Google Photos: Google adds creative touches to images that you thought were previously unwanted. If you took multiple shots of a sun setting or your child smiling, for example, it stitches them into an animation.The lower the cost is of searching, then the more one should ask the question of, should I be organizing this at all? Mr. Christian said.After migrating my entire photo library to Google Photos, my answer is a resounding no."}
{"text": "On Tuesday, the Hudson Yards megaproject officially opened on the Far West Side of Manhattan. Employees of Coach  a leading New York design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle collections, as it calls itself  began reporting to the companys new headquarters in a 52-story tower, 10 Hudson Yards.The opening is a reminder that New York City can change in the span of a human lifetime. So are Jan Stallers exhibition, Frontier New York, Then and Now, at IAC headquarters in Chelsea, and a newly published book, High Line Nudes, by Kevin McDermott.Mr. McDermotts photos are startling for more than one reason. Only a decade ago, a photographer and three male models could trespass on the abandoned New York Central Railroad freight viaduct and work without interruption among the asters and Queen Annes lace. Today, they would be under Coachs corporate gaze. (Two of the men did wear boots.)Mr. Stallers show contrasts contemporary photos and videos of the Hudson River waterfront with pictures he took in the 1970s and 80s, published as Frontier New York.It is a distant waterfront, but one that I recognize.During my brief career at Columbia College in the early 70s, when I should have been studying, I was drawn to Manhattans haunting industrial edge; not seeking sex, though it abounded for gay men, but searching for whispers of maritime might.From those old piers, I could almost watch the past weigh anchor and steam out through the Narrows.Pier 50, abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, looked as if it would collapse in the next fresh gale. Its carmine facade was peeling scabrously. I could see sky through the pier sheds windows. Yet elsewhere, there were still traces of life.At Pier 42, the Liberty ship John W. Brown was still on duty. It served as a floating annex to the Food and Maritime High School. School ship officials proudly note that virtually all graduates go to sea, The New York Times reported.Over the railroad viaduct, known as the High Line, boxcars still occasionally rumbled through the factories and storehouses of Chelsea. Automobiles still threaded their way over the elevated West Side Highway, which skirted the Hudson River.From the highway, the future came into view. Near its southern end, where you could still get a plate of chow mein at the Cathay Inn, the twin towers of the World Trade Center were rising.This was a place Mr. Staller came to love, beginning with visits in 1976 to the West Side Highway. By the time he arrived, the southern end was closed to vehicles, but not to intrepid pedestrians.It is to these areas that I have long been drawn, lingering there to meditate on a quality of light, space and weather, Mr. Staller wrote in the preface to his book, published in 1988. In the decay and desertion of these rundown places, there is much for me to explore, and I find the atmosphere to be rich in mystery, reminiscent of a lost city.No longer. The setting for the Frontier New York show, IAC headquarters, at 555 West 18th Street, was designed by Frank Gehry and is home to the corporate parent of The Daily Beast, About.com and Vimeo. Mr. Stallers work is being shown on a 120-foot-long video wall that can be seen through the buildings sail-like windows from the landscaped boulevard where the West Side Highway once stood.In a mesmerizing visual essay, Mr. Stallers earlier photos are juxtaposed with contemporary images of ice floes on the Hudson, construction at Hudson Yards and countless pedestrians on the High Line. Something new for my work, he said. People.Thats how much the area has changed. In 2006, you could count the number of people on the High Line with the fingers of one hand  Mr. McDermott and his models: Micky Friedmann, Joshua Parrillo and Michael Remaley.There was this little Eden in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the world, Mr. McDermott recalled.You felt you were escaping the city when you went to 10th Avenue, he said, retracing his steps as tourists eddied around him. I had no idea all of humanity would wander over here once they got off the plane."}
{"text": "NEWARK  Hillary Clinton on Wednesday seized upon revelations about Trump University, the for-profit institution started by Donald J. Trump, calling him a fraud who wants to rip off the country he is running to lead.In the first minutes of her speech at a rally here, Mrs. Clinton brought up newly released testimony by former employees of what she called the so-called Trump University, telling the crowd, You cant make this up.The testimony, released on Tuesday, portrayed Trump University as an unscrupulous business that used high-pressure sales tactics and deceptive marketing to lure thousands of people to enroll in classes. In many cases, the employees said, customers were persuaded to purchase classes they could not afford, by opening credit cards or borrowing the money.Speaking at the Newark campus of Rutgers University, Mrs. Clinton told the crowd that employees had testified that Trump U. was a fraudulent scheme where Donald Trump enriched himself at the expense of hard-working people. She said that Mr. Trump and those who worked for him took advantage of vulnerable Americans.This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud, Mrs. Clinton added. He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has unleashed attacks against Mr. Trump on a variety of subjects, including his views on foreign policy, his failure to release his tax returns and his stated hopes, before the Great Recession, that the real estate market would crash.Its important that we recognize what he has done, because thats usually a pretty good indicator of what he will do, she told the crowd on Wednesday.Mrs. Clinton campaigned here ahead of next weeks primary; New Jersey is among the six states that vote or caucus on Tuesday. She was joined by the musician Jon Bon Jovi as well as Senator Cory Booker, the former Newark mayor and a possible vice-presidential candidate.I hate to contradict Bon Jovi, Mr. Booker said in referring to one of his biggest hits from the 1980s, but dear God, Hillary Clinton, you give love a good name."}
{"text": "When Reza Zarrab, a gold trader based in Turkey, was arrested on a recent trip to the United States and sent to New York to face federal charges, his lawyer tried to keep him out of prison by tapping into Mr. Zarrabs considerable wealth.His client would post a $50 million bond, secured by $10 million in cash. He would stay in a rental apartment in Manhattan and wear a GPS monitoring device. And one more thing: Mr. Zarrab would pay for 24-hour guards to ensure that he did not flee and to escort him to and from the courthouse.The request, which a judge is expected to take up on Thursday, is not as unusual as it may seem. The rich are different from everyone else, even those accused of crimes. But a handful of extremely wealthy defendants, particularly those from overseas, are testing courts by proposing to live in self-financed gilded cages while they await their fate.Prosecutors vigorously objected to Mr. Zarrabs being allowed to face trial under such conditions, telling a federal judge in Manhattan that the proposed plan would allow a rich defendant to build a personal jail for himself in a Manhattan apartment, staffed by a firm on his payroll.Zarrabs proposed bail conditions, the government said, are an attempt to use his tremendous wealth to obscure the flight risk through a facade of security that is beyond the reach of all but a small subset of fabulously wealthy defendants.Mr. Zarrabs lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, has sharply disputed the governments position, saying that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Zarrab was arriving in Miami to visit Disney World with his wife and 5-year-old daughter, is devoted to his family and charitable causes and is not a threat to flee.Whether Mr. Zarrab succeeds remains to be seen, but other defendants have already been granted release on such terms.Last October, Ng Lap Seng, a Chinese billionaire indicted on charges that he bribed the former president of the United Nations General Assembly, was granted bond of $50 million, secured by $20 million cash and a Midtown apartment where he would be confined and subjected to GPS monitoring and round-the-clock guards at his own expense.Many thousands of people arrested in New York languish in the citys jails because they are unable to make even modest bail. So advocates for prisoners and lawyers for indigent defendants say the idea that some defendants are able to stay out of jail because they have the means to finance a novel confinement plan is blatantly unfair.It just reinforces for me the point that our entire system of pretrial detention is predominantly based on wealth, said Inimai M. Chettiar, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice who runs an initiative to end mass incarceration.Joshua Norkin, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of New York, said the elaborate bail package that was being proposed for Mr. Zarrab and that was granted to Mr. Ng should remind judges in the state court system that they have the tools to release low-income people on alternative and more creative forms of bail, and theyre failing to do it.The cases of wealthy defendants receiving special bail conditions are not limited to international defendants.In 2009, Marc S. Dreier, a Manhattan lawyer who pleaded guilty to running an elaborate scheme that defrauded hedge funds and other investors of $700 million, was granted a $10 million bond pending trial and remained in his East Side apartment, secured by electronic monitoring and armed security guards, which his family paid for.Mr. Dreier, prosecutors said, used his criminal proceeds to support a lavish lifestyle, including ownership of the apartment, property in the Hamptons, a valuable art collection and an $18 million yacht.In a written opinion, the judge in the case, Jed S. Rakoff, acknowledged concerns that such an arrangement for Mr. Dreier gave people of means an opportunity for release that poorer people could never obtain.Many kinds of bail conditions favored the rich, Judge Rakoff said, and, conversely, there were many defendants who were too poor to afford even the most modest of bail bonds or financial conditions of release. This is a serious flaw in our system, he wrote.Still, he added, it is not a reason to deny a constitutional right to someone who, for whatever reason, can provide reasonable assurance against flight.One unusual condition set by Judge Rakoff was that Mr. Dreier had to consent in writing to the use of reasonable force by the armed guards in case he tried to flee. Mr. Dreier later was sentenced to 20 years in prison.The debate last fall over Mr. Ngs bail touched on similar issues. Mr. Ng, a Chinese real estate magnate with a net worth of about $1.8 billion, owned private airplanes and had passports from at least three countries, the government said.In a bail hearing, a prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, argued that Mr. Ng, who has pleaded not guilty, had no family or other ties in the United States. There is no reason for him to remain, Mr. Richenthal said. Literally zero. Fifty-million-dollar bond is meaningless to him; $20 million is meaningless to him.The judge, Vernon S. Broderick, ultimately ruled that there were conditions that could assure Mr. Ngs appearance in court, and, over the governments objection, granted the $50 million bail package, including home confinement with round-the-clock security, the monitoring of his phone calls and other strict conditions that he detailed in an order.The latest case involves Mr. Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that include conspiring to violate the United States sanctions on Iran. The case has been widely watched in Turkey: In 2013, Mr. Zarrab was detained by the Turkish authorities in a broad corruption investigation of businessmen with ties to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister and now Turkeys president.The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, has asked that the judge, Richard M. Berman, deny bail to Mr. Zarrab, saying evidence of his participation in the charged offenses was overwhelming, and claiming Mr. Zarrab misled a court officer regarding his international travel and his assets.Mr. Bhararas office noted Mr. Zarrab had amassed a considerable fortune, citing evidence of his ownership in about 20 properties, seven sea vessels, 17 luxury automobiles, a private airplane and over $10 million in artwork.Mr. Zarrabs lawyer, Mr. Brafman, has argued in court papers that his client, who was born in Iran and moved to Turkey as an infant, is not a risk to flee. Mr. Brafman asked the judge not to detain his client simply because he is wealthy and lacks ties to the United States, and he argued that the bail proposal removes any possible concern of flight.Mr. Zarrab is a husband and a father who is committed to his family, Mr. Brafman wrote, and would not countenance life as a fugitive."}
{"text": "PARIS  On Tuesday, Novak Djokovic held an umbrella and danced along the baseline. On Wednesday, he wore a yellow rain hat in a postmatch interview.Djokovic, the No. 1 seed, was in good spirits as he overcame intermittent downpours, heavy conditions and a sluggish start to defeat 14th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 7-5, over two days to advance to the quarterfinal round.It is the 10th time Djokovic has reached the quarterfinals at the French Open, one shy of Roger Federers record for the Open era. It is also the 28th consecutive time Djokovic has reached the quarterfinals of a major tournament, passing Jimmy Connors, who made it to 27 straight. Federer leads that category with 36.More important, the top-ranked Djokovic is seeking his first French Open championship to go with his 11 other Grand Slam singles titles. For the last two days, though, all he wanted was just a few hours without rain.I remember early in my career I played a match against Kiefer in Wimbledon for five days, Djokovic said. That was the longest I have played one match. This is probably the second longest. Same reason. Raining.Djokovic was referring to his four-set marathon against Nicolas Kiefer in 2007. His match against Bautista required only two days, but it featured a few key momentum swings coinciding with the interruptions.On Thursday, weather permitting, Djokovic will play seventh-seeded Tomas Berdych, who beat 11th-seeded David Ferrer, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3. In the other quarterfinal matchup that was finally settled on Wednesday, 13th-seeded Dominic Thiem will face 12th-seeded David Goffin.Goffin finished off Ernests Gulbis, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3, in a continuation of their suspended match from Tuesday. Thiem did the same to Marcel Granollers, 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4.In quarterfinal matches Wednesday, second-seeded Andy Murray won his 10th straight match on clay, overcoming No. 9 Richard Gasquet, 5-7, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 6-2. In the semifinals, he will face the defending champion, Stan Wawrinka, who beat Albert Ramos-Violas, 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (7).Now the big issue for the men is whether they will be able to cram in all their matches and conclude with a Sunday final, as scheduled. Or will the final will be pushed to Monday?Djokovic said he had spoken with tournament and tour officials about the scheduling, which could include his playing four days in a row with a day of rest before the final.Thats an ideal scenario right there, he said. Lets see, first of all, whether or not I can win my quarterfinals and put myself in a position to play semis and maybe final. Thats No. 1. And No. 2 is whether were going to have rain or not.On Tuesday, Djokovic played very poorly and lost the first set. He seemed perfectly happy when play was suspended for about three hours because it gave him a moment to relax and reassess. During the rain delay, he had fun with the umbrella, but once back on court with a racket, he dominated Bautista, at least until the next delay caused a suspension for the remainder of the day.Back on court Wednesday under dark clouds but no real rain, Djokovic wrapped up the third set but found himself in trouble in the fourth. The key game came after Bautista broke Djokovic to take a 4-2 lead. Had he been able to consolidate that by holding serve and eventually winning the set, it would have put tremendous pressure on Djokovic in the fifth.But Djokovic broke back when Bautista double-faulted at 0-40. The rest was fairly routine.It was a great mental test for all of us, really, yesterday, the entire day, Djokovic said of the rain Tuesday. Im, in a way, glad to have a match like this because its a challenge that you need to overcome mentally, mostly."}
{"text": "BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil  Around here, they dont talk about that night a whole lot anymore.Its a Saturday in the Mineiro, and a smattering of fans wander into a poorly attended top-flight club match inside the stadium where, nearly two years ago, Germany thrashed Brazil, 7-1, in the World Cup semifinals. That moment  one of the most remarkable games of soccer ever played, given the score, the setting and the subplots  once left mouths hanging open. These days, it is more likely to produce only a shrug.It is not about humiliation; it is merely indifference. One of the many myths about Brazilian fans is that they love soccer. The reality is that they love winning, and they revere winning beautifully. But as their national team drifts relentlessly away from its glorious past, they have rarely been further from both of those things.The sport being bad here isnt anything new, said Tosto, a member of the countrys 1970 World Cup championship team. A physician, Tosto made his own diagnosis. This isnt a sudden sickness, and that 7-1 semifinal wasnt just a sudden problem, he said. The standard has been falling for 40 years, getting progressively worse, with no medicine to quickly cure it.For those who have not checked in on the patient since its World Cup implosion, the prognosis is no better. The coach who oversaw the World Cup disaster, Luiz Felipe Scolari, was fired after the tournament and replaced with the even more pragmatic Dunga. But the results have not improved.At one stage during last years Copa Amrica, Dungas Brazil had four central defenders on the field as it ran down the clock against lowly Venezuela. Brazil went out in the quarterfinals. Almost a year later, Brazil sits outside the qualification spots for the 2018 World Cup, with only two wins in its first six qualifying matches. As the Copa Amrica Centenario kicks off this weekend and the Rio Olympics loom this summer, Brazils national team is, in many ways, a shadow of its famous past, fearful rather than feared.Maybe our game is the worst its ever been, said Juca Kfouri, one of Brazils most respected soccer analysts. They had so many problems in that moment in 2014, but what did they change? They replaced Felipo with Dunga as manager, and that was it, when the problems run so much deeper. But the issue with our football is more structural than technical. The huge corruption doesnt allow it to get better, to be more professional, so we can actually tackle the problems.The joke used to go that when God created the world, he decided to give Brazil the best soccer players and the worst administrators. It drew laughs until recent times, when only the second part was actually true. One need look only at the three most recent presidents of the C.B.F., the national soccer association, to truly understand the levels of disarray: All three have been charged by the United States Department of Justice in its investigation of corruption in soccer. The incumbent, Marco Polo Del Nero, was recently restored to his post despite his indictment but has no plans to travel to the Copa Amrica out of fear that he might be detained.There is a promiscuous relationship inside Brazilian football, Tosto said. You have C.B.F. administrators heading for jail, and this helped along and sped up the failure of Brazilian football. So much has to be changed to get better  the administration, the management of the football here, the players have to be created differently.Listening to other Brazilian greats does not inspire confidence that change is on the way. Zico, a star in the 1970s and 80s, described those controlling the Brazilian game as businessmen with powerful economic interests, not men who want to see the best football. Romrio, a World Cup winner in 1994 and now a member of Congress, has called the C.B.F. a gang of thieves. And Kak, a former world player of the year, recently lamented that theres no organization, nobody dealing with the future.International results bear that out. Brazil, the only country to have played in every World Cup, last won the tournament in 2002. Back at the Mineiro, the club that calls the stadium home, Cruzeiro, is the perfect representation of the state of Brazilian domestic soccer.In 2013 and 2014, Cruzeiro won the Brazilian title under Coach Marcelo Oliveira, and by the start of 2015, defender Paulo Andre attributed the teams winning ways to the patience that had allowed the club to instill a clear philosophy. Yet four games into last season, Cruzeiros leadership abruptly fired Oliveira. Now on its fourth coach since, Cruzeiro sits near the bottom of the league.That kind of turnover is not unusual; last season, across the 20-team Serie A, there were 31 managerial changes, a record probably unmatched worldwide. Critics say that type of obsession with short-term triumphs is what has stunted long-term growth. Teams continually changing strategy are more likely to cast off players who do not fit into a new coachs plans, and those that lose games  and money  have even more incentive to sell young players rather than wait and hope that they develop into valuable assets.It is little wonder, then, that a Chinese league willing to pay almost any price for imported players has overtaken Europe as the major export market for the Brazilian leagues best talent, or that the countrys national team has never been as reliant on one star as it is now on Neymar.Unquestionably his countrys best player, Neymar is the fur coat covering a threadbare suit. But he will not play in the Copa Amrica, left off the roster in the hopes that he could deliver an Olympic gold medal in Rio instead. Without him, the Brazil that has arrived in the United States this month is a mix of physical and functional, a hard-running side that reminds few Brazilians of the teams that once carried the best of Brazils culture into the world with creativity, passion, color and flair.We were blessed with many generations of incredible players, said Kfouri, the analyst. That was seen as a rule, and now people are realizing it was the exception. We arent creating those players, and part of the problem has been the property speculation  green spaces have been done away with, they are trying to bring in laws that limit beach football, so that doesnt allow for street footballers. But then we dont produce in academies, as theres a total lack of management structure.The solutions are obvious, but those in suits think we were once No. 1, so they dont have to do anything."}
{"text": "It was the fall womens meeting of Local 600, the cinematographers union, that kindled the idea. Gathered in the Nyack, N.Y., home of Ellen Kuras, an Oscar nominee who shot Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, female directors of photography, assistants and camera operators swapped stories of their trade  and the challenges of being underrepresented in it.There was a sense of momentum, and being surrounded by nearly three dozen other professional camerawomen felt inspiring, Autumn Eakin, a cinematographer who was at that gathering last year, said. With the support of others, she decided to build on that camaraderie: a few months later, she inaugurated Cinematographers XX, a website and networking group showcasing the work of female D.P.s, or directors of photography. Her hope was to highlight their achievements instead of their scarcity.Yes, we need to talk about the fact that there are few women, because there are, she said. But its also important to advocate for people who are there. There have been women shooting, telling stories, for decades, at least. We are here!Cinematographers XX, whose website went up in February, is one of several new efforts among professionals in the industry to correct its gender inequity. The International Collective of Female Cinematographers, a networking and resource site that went live in April, is another. It was formed, a spokeswoman said, out of the desire to get rid of the singular excuse we hear so often: There just arent enough female D.P.s. A documentary, Cameraperson, about the cinematographer Kirsten Johnson, has been making the festival rounds.Local 600, the International Cinematographers Guild, is also taking steps on behalf of its members, publishing an ad in the Hollywood trade journals with the names of female directors of photography and camera operators, as a reminder that they exist and are hirable, and convening meetings with studios and producers. Branches of the union have also organized womens conferences, like the one at Ms. Kurass house for the Eastern Region membership. And in January, the guild named Xiomara Comrie its national diversity officer, a new post, to coordinate and expand outreach.If Hollywoods dismal track record with female directors is well known, lately the focus has shifted to other crew members, for whom the data is equally egregious. For the 2,000 top-grossing movies from 1994 to 2013, only 1.8 percent of the cinematographers were women, according to a study by the producer and researcher Stephen Follows. And the overall numbers for technical jobs have actually gotten worse for women since 1994, he said.Were talking about breaking a longstanding cycle of hiring that favors men, said Rebecca Rhine, who was appointed the national executive director of Local 600 in December. Even choosing her as a leader, she said, is a sign that the union is open to change, and acknowledging that we have work to do, in broadening the ranks. Still, most of its executives are male.Women make up about 12 percent of Local 600s camera department roster, Ms. Rhine said. (The union also represents entertainment industry publicists.) The group is just beginning to compile the numbers for people of color among its ranks. You cant have progress except by looking at the starting point, she said, adding, This is not going to fix itself passively.When Ms. Eakin graduated from film school, she said, she had little sense that her trajectory might differ from a male cinematographers. She began her career in St. Louis a dozen years ago, then moved to New York and worked steadily on commercials, documentaries, television and features.But along the way, she said, she discovered that perceptions about her gender mattered. Theres an assumption of incapability, a lot of times, when it comes to women, as opposed to the assumption of capability when it comes to men, she said.Rachel Morrison, a cinematographer who shot the indie favorites Fruitvale Station and Dope, agreed that women have to work harder to prove themselves. Ive had something like seven films at Sundance, one of which won the Grand Jury Prize, she said. Ive noticed male counterparts who had similar successes getting a phone call to do a big-budget studio film. I wasnt getting those phone calls.Women can still reach that level, she added, but have to shoot two $1 million movies before getting a $5 million assignment, and so on. Theres never a call like, You did great on your $5 million movie, heres a $100 million project, she said. My experience is that guys get to take the fast route.As in most fields, the timing of motherhood and balancing its demands are added hurdles. Producers hear that youre due in February, and they dont want to hire you for a job that ends in January, Ms. Morrison said.Ms. Morrison shot Dope while she was pregnant, and the HBO movie Confirmation while she was breast-feeding, so she found ways to pump on set. (Both were directed by Rick Famuyiwa.) Pregnancy, she said, should be viewed as working with a broken wrist.Its not something that has take you out of the equation, she said.Sharing ways to navigate issues like these is one goal of the meetings held by Cinematographers XX. Its not affiliated with the union, although there is crossover; Ms. Eakin is a Local 600 member, and Ms. Rhine, the union director, said she viewed it and other sites as a complement to her work.Ms. Eakin said she hoped that Cinematographers XX, which has about 40 established directors of photography and 18 who are starting out, would serve as a resource for hiring: Producers and studios can no longer pretend they dont have access to any female cinematographers. Women must apply to join, and are vetted by Ms. Eakin and others; some have been turned away, or asked to update their production reels. For now, the focus is women who can work in New York or Los Angeles, although the group is allied with the International Collective of Female Cinematographers, which has over 150 vetted members. Ms. Eakin said Cinematographers XX and its Facebook group have already resulted in jobs for some members.Ms. Morrison, one of the few women registered with Local 600 as a director of photography (most are camera operators or assistants), said she was inspired to join Cinematographers XX because she saw studios and producers responding to the renewed discussion about the dearth of female directors. This dialogue is having an effect, she said, though she added that she looked forward to the day when she could just be referred to as a D.P., and not a female D.P.Ms. Eakin said spotlighting the range and diversity of female cinematographers underscored their strength. Everyone can stop questioning whether women can command a set and a crew and be creative and technical at the same time, she said. We can and we do. We just need to get past it being this rarity."}

The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.20 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,952.25.The major indexes opened lower on Wednesday, echoing a slide in markets in Europe and Asia as traders considered new reports on Chinas manufacturing sector, including one suggesting a weaker outlook for the nations factories.Investors also got an early look a mix of new domestic data. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell in April by the biggest amount in five years, dragged down by declines in housing, commercial construction and spending on government projects.Separately, car shopping site Kelley Blue Book projected that domestic auto sales slumped 7 percent in May, usually one of the strongest months for the industry. The drop is the biggest monthly decline since August 2010.Most major automakers reported lower sales in May compared with May 2015. Shares of General Motors lost $1.06, or 3.4 percent, to $30.22, while Ford Motor shares slid 38 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $13.11.Shares of CarMax, the auto dealership chain, fell $1.57, or 2.9 percent, to $52.09.The Institute of Supply Management said that domestic factories expanded for the third straight month in May, helped by a weaker dollar. Its another data point in the direction of things being O.K., said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede.Investors outlook improved by late afternoon, when the Federal Reserve released its latest snapshot of the economy, the so-called beige book.The Feds latest survey of business conditions found that half of its 12 regions described growth as modest, while Dallas said economic activity had increased marginally.

Its results exceeded Wall Streets expectations. The stock gained $2.80 to close at $45.54.Cracker Barrel, the restaurant change, vaulted 8.4 percent after reporting strong earnings growth for its fiscal third quarter. The stock added $12.74 to $164.22.Other companies did not fare as well. Under Armour slumped 3.9 percent to $36.25 after slashing its full-year revenue guidance and saying that the closure of Sports Authority stores will hurt its sales.

{"text": "TORONTO  Pitchers are perpetual tinkerers. If they are not this way by nature, they are made so by circumstance  having so much time on their hands by virtue of having four days between starts or many idle innings in the bullpen.They fiddle with different grips, test new arm slots and experiment with varying velocities of their pitches, so when a pitcher toes the rubber, he does not do so by happenstance.Where a pitcher places his plant foot may be a matter of inches, but it can make a world of difference. Jake Arrieta transformed his career several years ago when he moved to the third-base side of the rubber and began to throw across his body.So it was no trifling matter two weeks ago when, after back-to-back poor outings, Masahiro Tanaka began pitching from the first-base side of the rubber for the first time in his three seasons with the Yankees.As encouraging as the results have been for Tanaka, there are no such simple adjustments for the Yankees, whose offense continued to flounder on Wednesday night in a 7-0 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays.In six innings, Tanaka allowed one earned run, as well as an unearned run after center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury dropped a routine liner. Tanaka then watched Toronto bludgeon the Yankees bullpen to complete a three-game sweep.The loss was the Yankees seventh in nine games against the Blue Jays, who have won 20 of 28 against the Yankees dating to the start of last season.You shut this team down to two runs in six innings, you should have an opportunity to win the game, said Yankees Manager Joe Girardi, whose team has scored a combined five runs in its last four games.Although Tanaka had trouble locating his pitches and allowed seven hits, his usual resolve kept Toronto scoreless until Josh Donaldson poked a 1-2 slider off the plate into right in the fifth, scoring Darwin Barney from second. I actually threw it exactly where I wanted to, that pitch, Tanaka said through an interpreter. Donaldson did not have the best swing, but he got to the ball very well.Meanwhile, the Yankees remained punchless at the plate. Aaron Sanchez shut them out for six and two-thirds innings as the Yankees left runners in scoring position five different times. Chase Headley struck out four times, including twice to end innings with runners in scoring position, and catcher Brian McCann struck out and flied out to leave two runners aboard in the third and in the fifth.The lack of support has been acute for Tanaka (3-1), who picked up his first loss, although his E.R.A. dropped to 2.78. The Yankees have scored three or fewer runs in six of his 11 starts.Moving to the other side of the pitching mound was tied to his decision to stray from his four-seam fastball, which he began to do last season when his velocity dipped several miles per hour, to the low 90s. This season, he has all but abandoned the four-seamer in favor of a two-seam sinker, which complements his splitter and his slider, giving him pitches that dart left, right and down.The move allows Tanakas right arm to be more centered on home plate, McCann said, giving the ball the appearance that it is coming out of the strike zone.It gives him a little more on both sides of the plate with right-handers, said the pitching coach Larry Rothschild, who described the transition as relatively seamless. The ability to command fastballs on both sides of the plate allows him to set up his other pitches.The reasons a pitcher stands in a particular way on the rubber are as varied as pitchers themselves. It depends on the types of pitches they throw, where they throw them from and what type of movement they get. Andrew Miller, a 6-foot-7 left-handed reliever, moved to the third-base side in 2010 because it meant a more direct path to the strike zone when he was struggling to throw strikes.Tanaka said he was pleased with the way he had pitched in his last start, a two-hit shutout of Tampa Bay for seven innings. He was less pleased with his first start from the new spot on the mound, in which he allowed five hits and one run at Oakland, and Wednesday nights performance, which he will examine more closely in the coming days.Then Tanaka will spend time preparing for his next start.Tinkering as always, he said.INSIDE PITCHIvan Nova called a lawsuit alleging he trashed a home he had rented in White Plains a complete lie. The suit, filed Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by the homes owner, Jose Rodriguez, alleged that Nova and his ex-wife, Jasmine, held raucous parties between September 2014 and September 2015 and left behind a cockroach infestation. Nova said he never lived in the home but acknowledged that his name was on the lease. He said he would fight the suit, which seeks $175,000."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Michael Lynton, the chief executive of Sony Entertainment, revamped the studios growing television division on Thursday, a move that will streamline operations and increase his personal oversight.For more than 15 years, Sony Pictures Television, the maker of shows like Breaking Bad, The Goldbergs and Shark Tank, has been run by Steve Mosko. But the studio and Mr. Mosko parted ways on Wednesday  Mr. Mosko has long been eager for expanded responsibilities  and he will not be replaced. Instead, five of Mr. Moskos lieutenants will now report directly to Mr. Lynton.They are Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, presidents of programming; Andy Kaplan, president of Sonys lucrative roster of overseas networks; Keith Le Goy, president of distribution; and Amy Carney, president of ad sales and research.We have incredibly strong leadership within our TV divisions, Mr. Lynton said in a statement. He thanked Mr. Mosko for helping to build Sony Pictures Television into one of the strongest television studios in the business.Sonys television fortunes vastly improved under Mr. Moskos leadership, but the company remains one of Hollywoods smallest suppliers of small-screen programming. A consolidation in the television industry  all of the broadcast networks and many major cable channels now buy shows primarily from in-house studios  has left Sony, which is not aligned with a network, without a dance partner.But growth can still be achieved. Lionsgate, for instance, which does not have a sibling network, but has made its television operation a priority, makes more than 30 scripted series and about 50 reality shows.Sonys television division, which makes 34 shows, including unscripted ones like Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, has long felt like a stepchild at Sony, which has historically placed most of its emphasis on movies. Mr. Lyntons move on Thursday, the company emphasized, was designed to more fully integrate Sonys television unit into the broader studio."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  A changing of the small-screen guard continued on Wednesday, with Steve Mosko, the chairman of Sony Pictures Television, leaving the studio after having carried out a hard-fought turnaround.The departure of Mr. Mosko, 60, came a day after NBC Entertainment pushed out Bela Bajaria as president of Universal Television, which suffered a sharp decline in orders for the fall season, and four months after the ouster of Paul Lee as president of ABC, which has endured quick cancellations and aging hits.Mr. Moskos situation was somewhat less clear cut, according to two people briefed on the circumstances of his exit. A Sony spokesman declined to comment.Sony Television, which makes shows like Bloodline, The Blacklist, The Goldbergs and Jeopardy, has been considered a success, especially compared with Sonys considerably larger film operation. In some recent years, Mr. Moskos unit  left for dead in a 2001 downsizing  has provided more than half of the overall studios annual operating income.But that imbalance has been a source of frustration for Mr. Mosko, who joined Sony in 1991 after working at local stations in Pennsylvania and Maryland. As a result, it became widely known in Hollywood that his relationship with the person he viewed as responsible for it  his boss, Michael Lynton, chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment  was increasingly strained.Mr. Moskos contract was set to expire. A decision was made not to renew it. Sony is expected to put a new television management regime in place rapidly. The likely outcome involves promoting Mr. Moskos longtime lieutenants, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht.Sonys television business, which also includes a roster of overseas networks and the Crackle streaming service, is particularly reliant on the development of shows that buyers like ABC, NBC and CBS say they cannot do without. That is because the big broadcast networks have become increasingly aligned with their own internal studio suppliers. Sony is the only studio left that does not have a network sibling.For the fall season, Sony sold shows to ABC, NBC and CBS, with some new series landing in prime slots on Thursday and Monday nights. Sony also controls the still-lucrative distribution rights to old sitcoms, including Seinfeld.Mr. Mosko is known in Hollywood as the consummate insider. His ability to foster deep business relationships began during his earlier days in television, when he sold ads for a Baltimore station; he once closed a deal by plying a client with flaming shots of sambuca and then arm-wrestling him for the business."}
{"text": "A Texas man posted a photo of his dead girlfriends body on her Facebook page on Sunday after fatally stabbing her as part of a suicide pact, the police say. The image remained on the site for 36 hours before Facebook removed it.The man, Kenneth Alan Amyx, 45, told the authorities that he and his girlfriend, Jennifer Streit-Spears, 43, had discussed a suicide pact for months. They had been drinking at an apartment in Plano, Tex., and had agreed to stab each other until both died, according to a Plano Police Department affidavit. But Ms. Streit-Spears chickened out, Mr. Amyx said, and he had to finish her off, according to the affidavit.Officer David Tilley, a spokesman for the department, said that Mr. Amyx not only posted a photo of Ms. Streit-Spears  nude and with her neck cut  on her page, he also posted a selfie of his face covered in blood and the words Pray for us, the officer said.Officer Tilley said the photo of the body was dark, as though the lights had been out and the photo had been taken without a flash. Still, he said, it was quite disturbing.The privacy settings on the Ms. Streit-Spearss Facebook account did not allow access to the public, Officer Tilley said, though he added, Its everywhere for family and friends to see.After the stabbing, Mr. Amyx called his father and said: This is Ken. I love you. Weve cut our throats, and gave him the address of the apartment, the affidavit said. Mr. Amyx was charged with murder.Ms. Streit-Spearss mother called 911 around 10 a.m. on Sunday after seeing the photos on Facebook and after Mr. Amyx had texted them to her, the police said. But the photos remained on Facebook for about 36 hours, even after Ms. Streit-Spearss relatives asked the social media giant to remove them.Facebook, which receives one million reports a week about possible violations of community standards, said the image of the body at first did not appear to violate its policies, because it was not immediately clear what it depicted and that it had been posted by someone other than the account user.We remove graphic images when they are shared to celebrate violence, a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. As soon as it was clear what the facts were behind this photograph, we removed it.Robert J. Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, noted that social media sites were being used in ways that could not have been predicted years ago, adding that the Texas case was not the first time recordings of violent acts had been posted online.In Florida, Derek Medina  posted a photo of his wifes bloody body on Facebook after shooting her eight times. He was convicted of second-degree murder and was sentenced in February to life in prison.As for what could lead someone to post incriminating evidence on Facebook to be seen by so many, Mr. Thompson said, There is no rational answer to it.Ms. Streit-Spearss Facebook page has since been turned into a memoriam page. According to her social media profile, she studied criminal justice at the University of North Texas. She and Mr. Amyx had been dating for about four months, the police affidavit said, before the stabbing.The couple took turns cutting each other, Mr. Amyx told the authorities, but after she was cut, she became too weak to continue, he said. Officer Tilley said the police found Mr. Amyx naked and bloody in a bedroom. The police initially thought he was dead until he started to make noises. He had superficial cuts and one wound on his neck, which required stitches, the officer said.Two knives, one of them a six-inch carving knife, were found at the scene. As he was being taken to the hospital, the police said, Mr. Amyx told a firefighter: Oh, I killed her. Oh, I lost her. Ill never get her back. Just kill me.Mr. Amyx had two outstanding warrants: one accusing him of indecency with a child in Dallas County, and another charging him with sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 in Rockwall County, according to court records.Mr. Amyxs father, Charles, declined to comment on Tuesday night, citing the instructions of his lawyer. In an interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Amyxs lawyer, Keith Gore, said some things had not yet been disclosed in the case but did not elaborate.He said he would seek to have his clients bond reduced; it was set at a total of $600,000 in the murder case and two other cases."}
{"text": "In the authors note after A Good Month for Murder: The Inside Story of a Homicide Squad, Del Quentin Wilber writes that Homicide, the 1991 book by David Simon that birthed the television show of the same name, had a major influence on his reporting career.You can see how. Mr. Wilbers book, which follows one month in the chaotic life of the homicide unit of Prince Georges County in Maryland, arrives camera-ready. The detectives crack wise over dull-eyed corpses; razz one another about sex; and take their turns extracting information in the box, that windowless interview room where suspects are often left to stew, space out and in some cases, take the felony nap  that brief snooze in which only the guilty, in the detectives view, feel free to indulge.The innocent pace, bounce on their toes, sob, explains Mr. Wilber, who covers the Justice Department for The Los Angeles Times.Prince Georges County, a predominantly black suburb just to the east of Washington, contains both a thriving upper-middle class (the median household income is $20,000 higher than the United States average), and deep veins of poverty. Its police force has had a history of misconduct and aggression, and its per capita murder rates have in recent years been among the highest in the nation. All told, the detectives in A Good Month for Murder investigated 12 new homicides in February 2013, when the book takes place.Mr. Simon spent a full year with the homicide unit in Baltimore. But the differences between his book and Mr. Wilbers cant just be measured in months.In Mr. Simons book, the detectives may be flawed, but they also come across as sympathetic and sharp  the homicide unit is the natural habitat of that rarefied species, the thinking cop, he writes  and the murder victims are described as exactly that, victims, no matter what kind of lives they led.Mr. Simons worldview, spelled out with rueful, crystalline precision in everything hes ever done (particularly The Wire) is simple: The game is rigged. Young black men in poor neighborhoods are outrageously impeded by diminished economic horizons, the unforgiving rules of the street, centuries of institutional racism. The best-intentioned and brightest detectives are working on a shoestring in communities that have zero reason to trust them. And everyones getting the shaft from elected officials, who generally care more about poll numbers than the lives theyve sworn to improve and protect.Mr. Wilber makes no such points. He does not analyze the larger political context or embedded cultural assumptions that inform detective work. In the wake of minutely reported and perspective-shifting books like The New Jim Crow and Ghettoside, this is a peculiar omission at best. Theres no mention of the Black Lives Matter movement. Theres very little discussion of the long history of police brutality in Prince Georges County. (Ta-Nehisi Coatess good friend Prince Jones was killed by an African-American cop from Prince Georges County, a wrenching episode described in Between the World and Me.) Mr. Wilbers book drops from the sky, seemingly from nowhere, like an asteroid.Perhaps because he spent so much time in the detectives company, Mr. Wilber appears to have unconsciously aligned his sympathies with them. When one brandishes a fake DNA report to goad a suspect into confessing to a rape, Mr. Wilber approvingly describes it as a cunning sleight of hand, noting the accused becomes a sobbing, snot-bubbling mess.Yet its soon clear this fellow had nothing to do with the rape in question. Why, then, call this a cunning sleight of hand? Especially when, as we learn one paragraph later, it nearly drew a false confession from this man? Who, by the way, was just a terrified neighborhood sad sack?In some cases, Mr. Wilber turns his subjects into clichs, reinforcing our worst notions about the police. If hes trying to humanize them, hes not doing a particularly good job. Or maybe hes saying these detectives are those very clichs  but if thats true, their behavior deserves further comment.To say he lacks a verbal filter is an understatement, Mr. Wilber writes of one detective. He divulged that he euthanized his own dog with a snub-nosed .38 after it had broken its back. The reason? The dog was annoying him. He also brags about having killed a bear so he could obtain a fur rug on which to have sex. When encountering the Police Departments psychologist in the hallway, he will sometimes say, Joe, why do I still cry when I masturbate?If youre thinking what Im thinking, you have just one question on your mind, and its not about masturbation: Why hasnt the police psychologist grilled him about killing his dog? Doesnt the psychologist know? Seems like he should, given the detectives verbal incontinence. Mr. Wilber never says.I cant figure out why theres so little analysis here, to be honest. Mr. Wilber  also author of Rawhide Down, about the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan  has had a very good track record covering law enforcement and security issues. Before working for the Los Angeles Times, he worked for The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post, covering the police.Will readers still get a lesson in some of the folkways of the Prince Georges County homicide unit from this book, and how detectives build their cases? Yeah, sure. Theyll become familiar with how the police read crime scenes. Theyll see how cellphones have changed the way detectives do their work. (Though for anyone who has heard the first season of Serial, theres little here thats new.) Theyll learn how social media has bedeviled police investigations as much as helped them.If the detectives here are not always the most savory characters, they are diligent. Many are chronically sleepless  from injuries, long hours, graveyard shifts as security guards to make extra money (in one case, in an actual graveyard).But the people in the poorer neighborhoods of Prince Georges County barely come to life. We see only a deep distrust of the police, a dread of cooperating with investigations for fear of retaliation. We even see suspects begging to go to jail.Why would you want to go to jail? the detective asks.Sleep, he replies. And I can watch ESPN.And to the conversation about race and police work, Mr. Wilber contributes barely a jot. The Prince Georges County police force may have diversified in recent years, but at the top of the heap, theres still an imbalance: At the time he wrote his book, 20 of the 30 homicide detectives were white. The county is 65 percent black.Surely, the African-American detectives must have thoughts on this subject. Mr. Wilber mentions Andre Brooks, whose father was a Washington cop. In his youth, Detective Brooks knew that the Prince Georges County police had a reputation for being abusive and hostile to minorities. Still, Mr. Wilber writes, Brooks felt that the rewards of working as an officer would outweigh the departments legacy of intolerance, and he has never regretted the decision.Theres a world lurking in that sentence. Yet this is all we get."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Trump Vilifies Media Asking About Veterans (front page, June 1):As the director of a private foundation, I see a stark contrast between the standards and transparency that the public rightly demands of nonprofits and the resistance to such standards by Donald Trump.Mr. Trump raised money from the public for the benefit of veterans. Why, then, should he not be accountable to the public about where those funds were donated?The public has the right to know, and to ask through the press, how the funding decisions were made. Who made those decisions? Were these arms-length transactions or donations to friends or business associates? How much was actually raised? How much was donated? When?These are all legitimate questions. Mr. Trump has now answered them in part. That he should spew vitriol when asked to do so, however, speaks volumes about who he is as a person and how he would conduct a Trump presidency.MARSHA ATKINDRoseland, N.J.To the Editor:On Tuesday Donald Trump stepped on his tongue again, and he ended up in big trouble with the press. The press had raised questions about the amount of money he raised for veterans. That infuriated Mr. Trump, so he responded by saying that the press was biased and unfair in its reporting.Mr. Trumps real message to the news media was Im sick and tired of your biased reporting, and Im not going to take it anymore. Thats the same message that voters want Mr. Trump to deliver to the Washington establishment if he is elected president.DANIEL ROBINOWITZDallasTo the Editor:It is quite obvious that Donald Trump does not understand the role of the media in a democracy: to be the eyes and ears for all citizens by reporting as honestly and fairly as possible about events and individuals. They are our watchdogs.It increasingly seems to be the policy of politicians (and others) to shoot the messenger who delivers bad messages. Perhaps, since he so detests the media, the answer is to not report on him at all. Then, no mistakes will be made in the medias coverage of Mr. Trump.CLAUDE M. GRUENERAlbanyTo the Editor:Re Donald Trump and the Judge (editorial, June 1):Donald Trumps attack on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over a class-action lawsuit against Trump University, speaks volumes about Mr. Trumps recklessness and racism. In less than a minute on Google he could have determined that the judge was an American citizen born in Indiana, but he was unwilling to spend that little time to find the truth.By falsely calling the judge a foreigner, he meant to undermine respect for the judge and the judiciary.NORM TABLERIndianapolisTo the Editor:Re Rise of Trump Tracks Debate Over Fascism (front page, May 29):People may differ on how they define fascism. But for years commentators  from Alexander Hamilton to reporters covering the Arab Spring  have warned against too much power for the street mob.Violence, intolerance, mass delusions  all are the result of unfettered energy emanating from the unruly street. That The Times should now report on the fear of fascisms rise is too little too late. The dangers seen in the rantings of Donald Trump, and the violent response of some of his followers, are part of a pattern as old as history.Call it what you will, what we are seeing today is how ancient fears can be spread through the electronic media, and how, in the hands of a master showman, these common prejudices can be made to serve as a political platform.The worst is yet to come.MARC REUBENLanghorne, Pa.To the Editor:Jonathan Weismans courageous Sunday Review essay, The Nazi Tweets of Trump God Emperor  (May 29), points to a clue for Hillary Clintons campaign: Make sure to keep the hateful behavior of Donald Trump supporters always in public view and simultaneously call out Mr. Trump aggressively on his failure to address the fact that his campaign brings out and feeds on ugliness and hatred.Perhaps a constant reminder that a vote for Mr. Trump is a vote for the worst side of the American psyche will help bring home to decent people everywhere how vital it is to defeat Mr. Trump and his hordes promoting hatred.HILL GRIMMETTFort Collins, Colo."}

{"text": "For the next three days in Berlin, residents and visitors can order decidedly unconventional floral posies  variously inspired by pigeons nests, deep-sea creatures and the petroleum industry  for delivery. The five ephemeral flower sculptures on offer, each designed by an artist exhibiting in the citys Biennale and priced between $70 and $80, function as a sort of Interflora for the conceptual set. Flora Powers is not meant to be anything more lofty than a flower delivery service, explains Andrea Hill of Paloma Powers, the irreverent creative agency that has produced the project. Flowers are a very personal gift, and their delivery is a great moment to celebrate alongside the artists exhibiting in the Berlin Biennale.Contemporary artists from Jeff Koons to Taryn Simon have worked with flowers in exhibition contexts, but Hill believes this is the first attempt at an experimental artist-led flower delivery service. Its a bit more utilitarian, she notes. While the care that goes into them is every bit as much as a floral sculpture would have, their circulation is much more that of an arrangement or a bouquet. Once theyve been delivered to someone, its up to them what they do.The arrangements boast a variety of unusual elements: both Asger Carlsen and Rachel de Joode created their own vessels, he out of expanding polymer foam and she of hand-squished ceramic; while Sara Ludys TNJ Bouquet combines tentacles of Amaranthus with pungent garlic scapes. Amalia Ulmans composition evokes a pigeons scrappy nest, and in Monira Al Qadiris Cosa Nostra, flowers protrude from a giant artificial pearl with a gasoline-like luster that recalls the artists work on petroleum industries in the Gulf.The artists designs have been realized by the Vilnius-based florists Buketai, run by the sisters Aurime and Igne Aleksandraviciutes, who use flowers as a vehicle to deliver a message or an idea in their arrangements. And look, Aurime adds, excitedly: Now we are in Berlin, making arrangements with cigarette butts tucked in with babys breath, and creating vases from expanding foam.Beyond the challenging aesthetic of the projects, Hill says she sees the delivery itself as an element of performance that suggests one of many fields for further exploration in the Flora Powers project. Were very open to doing this again, in other cities and with other artists, she notes. See all five projects in the slide show above."}
{"text": "PITTSBURGH  The Penguins moved another win closer to claiming the Stanley Cup on Wednesday night, and again it was rookies that helped get them there.Conor Sheary scored 2 minutes 35 seconds into overtime, and goaltender Matt Murray made 21 saves to give the Penguins a 2-1 home victory over the San Jose Sharks and a two-games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven series. Forty-four of the 49 teams that have lost the first two games in previous Cup finals have lost the series.The Sharks will host Game 3 on Saturday.Sharks Coach Peter DeBoer took heart in the closeness of both games.Game 1 was decided in the last two minutes, he said. Tonight was an overtime game. I think well hold off on the funeral. Weve got a lot of hockey left to play.Shearys wrist shot from the high left slot off a feed from Kris Letang beat Martin Jones high to the far side. It was the fourth goal of the postseason for Sheary, a 23-year-old rookie.It usually doesnt work out like that when you draw up a play or even talk about a play, Sheary said. But I think they just lost me when I came off the wall there, and I had a lot of time to shoot, and it just worked out.Murray, 22, became just the fourth rookie in N.H.L. history to win as many as 13 postseason games  even if he was not tested much over the first two periods. The Sharks Justin Braun scored with 4:05 left in regulation to ruin Murrays shutout bid.Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan, speaking of his teams response to Brauns goal, said: One of the things I really liked about our team  and this is something I think weve evolved with over the last five months or so  our guys just play. And thats what we told them on the bench when it went into the net: You know what? San Jose is a good team; theyre going to get scoring chances. We liked how our team was playing, we felt like we carried the majority of the play.Phil Kessel scored 8:20 into the second period for Pittsburgh, which outshot its opponent for the 11th consecutive game. Following a 41-26 advantage in a 3-2 victory in Game 1 on Monday, the Penguins had 23 of the first 32 shots on goal in Game 2. San Jose went without a shot for a span of more than 11 minutes late in the second until it had two during a power play over the final 1:08 of the period.Although the Sharks did not score during that power play, it did provide a springboard into the third period. San Jose played with a desperation befitting a team that was on the verge of falling into a two-game hole. The Sharks tenacity was rewarded when Brauns slap shot from along the boards just above the right-wing circle made its way through traffic  deflecting at least once during its path to the net  and beat Murray inside the near post on his glove side. Joel Ward provided a good screen in front of the net.At that point, it appeared as if Murray was to be outplayed by Jones, who stopped 67 of 70 shots in this series until Shearys winning tally.Murray said: I thought in this game, we were the better team for the most part of the game. We stuck with what we needed to do, and we got the huge goal from Conor. So, we got the job done.While the Penguins roster is built on the stars Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Letang, rookies such as Sheary, Murray and Bryan Rust have played starring roles as the franchise seeks its fourth Stanley Cup, the second of the Crosby era and its first since 2009.Crosby did have the secondary assist on the winner, winning the face-off from the left wing side back to Letang. Crosby also assisted on a Sheary goal in Game 1 that came minutes after Rust had scored Pittsburghs fourth consecutive goal spanning the final two games of the Eastern Conference final.Kessels goal came 8:20 into the second period and was the result of a dreadful turnover by defenseman Roman Polak and a deflection of the puck off the skate of Sharks forward Tomas Hertl.The tally was the 10th time in the Penguins past 10 games that a member of their H.B.K. line scored a goal. Carl Hagelin, Nick Bonino and Kessel all had a hand in a sequence that began when Polak inadvertently set up Kessel for a wide-open chance.Although the puck bounced over Kessels stick, Hagelin stripped defenseman Brenden Dillon of the puck as soon as Dillon corralled it. Hagelin fed Bonino  who had the winning goal in Game 1  and Boninos shot hit the stick of a sliding Hertl, allowing the puck to trickle past Jones.It would have gone in anyway, but Kessel finished it into an open net for his team-leading 10th of the postseason."}
{"text": "The fortunes of Boys and Girls High School, a venerable but long-struggling school that Mayor Bill de Blasios administration pledged to revive, took another turn this week, when its principal said he was considering leaving for a different job after less than two years.The principal, Michael Wiltshire, was appointed in an unusual arrangement under which he oversees both Boys and Girls, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and Medgar Evers College Preparatory School, a selective school in Crown Heights where he was principal before being installed at Boys and Girls.Should Dr. Wiltshire depart, it would be a setback for the mayor in his effort to transform New York Citys most troubled schools.As a candidate, Mr. de Blasio criticized the administration of his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, for its practice of closing low-performing schools. Mr. de Blasio promised to infuse such schools with money and social services, with closing a last resort.The mayor is now under pressure to show that schools are improving before he seeks re-election next year. While the Education Department has cited some progress in the 94 schools it has made its main focus, including increased graduation rates at most of the high schools in the group, enrollment at those schools is plummeting as families move their children elsewhere.Dr. Wiltshires potential departure is not the only indication that the citys strategy is running into difficulty. The New York Post reported on Sunday that Caterina Lafergola, the principal of Automotive High School, another school that the de Blasio administration has made a top priority, is leaving to become the principal of Baldwin High School on Long Island.By the time Mr. de Blasio became mayor, Boys and Girls and Automotive had long been among the states worst-performing high schools. With the state threatening to close the schools, the city made a deal with the teachers union that required staff members to reapply for their jobs, and it named Dr. Wiltshire and Ms. Lafergola as the principals.Dr. Wiltshire said in an interview on Tuesday that he had interviewed for a job as principal of Uniondale High School in Uniondale, N.Y., and that the district had expressed interest in him, but he had not decided what to do.My focus now nine days before the end of the school year is to work as hard as I can to ensure the success of Medgar Evers and Boys and Girls, he said. At the end of the year I will make whatever decision that I need to make.Dr. Wiltshires tenure at Boys and Girls was troubled from the start. Upon arriving, he began to encourage students who were lacking credits and at risk of not graduating to transfer. On Tuesday, he defended his actions, saying some students lagged so far behind that they had no chance of graduating before turning 21 and aging out of the school system, and that they could be better served at schools designed for such older students.Dr. Wiltshire also clashed with a social services agency, Good Shepherd Services, that was supposed to provide support for students and their families, resulting in the agencys ending the partnership, according to a recent report in the education website Chalkbeat. Dr. Wiltshire denied that on Tuesday, saying he had no problem with Good Shepherd.Dr. Wiltshire raised concerns among some Boys and Girls supporters early on when he proposed that it merge  with Medgar Evers by having Medgar Evers move into Boys and Girls building.Some critics saw the proposal as a way to essentially phase out Boys and Girls, which has a larger, better-equipped building, while giving Medgar Evers, which occupies cramped quarters and does not have an auditorium or athletic fields, a better home.When the city did not support the merger proposal, Dr. Wiltshire suggested moving Medgar Evers into Boys and Girls building without combining the two schools. But a committee of parents and faculty members at Medgar Evers recently informed the Education Department that they no longer supported the move.Dr. Wiltshire said on Tuesday that he had made progress at Boys and Girls. The four-year graduation rate last year was 50 percent, up from 41.9 percent the previous year, according to the department, and Dr. Wiltshire said he expected it to be close to 60 percent this year. The department also said that student attendance had increased by nearly 2 percent this year compared with last year, and that teacher absenteeism had declined 22 percent from 2013-14 to 2014-15.At the same time, enrollment at Boys and Girls under Dr. Wiltshires leadership has declined by half, to 334 students.Boys and Girls has faced many challenges in its long history. By the mid-1980s, it had one of the highest dropout rates in the city and a reputation as a dangerous place. From 1986 to 2004 it experienced a resurgence under Frank Mickens, a principal who was a tough disciplinarian. The graduation rate increased  to 47.5 percent, from 24.4 percent  and enrollment reached a peak of 4,400 students in the 2005-6 school year.But Mr. Mickens was accused of achieving that success in part by pushing out difficult students. In 2005, former students brought a class-action lawsuit against the Education Department, saying that they had been deprived of a fair chance at an education. In 2008, the parties reached a settlement under which the department agreed to give some students extra time to earn a diploma and others access to G.E.D. classes, counseling, tutoring and trade-school training.A spokeswoman for the Uniondale School District said that the district was interviewing candidates and had not made a choice yet. Chalkbeat reported on Tuesday that Dr. Wiltshire was considering taking the job in Uniondale."}
{"text": "LONDON  The Rhodes Trust announced on Wednesday the largest expansion of the Rhodes scholarship program in its 113-year history. The trust will open the program, which finances graduate study at the University of Oxford, to students from Ghana, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Syria and the United Arab Emirates.Our goal is to be completely a global scholarship, Charles Conn, the warden of Rhodes House and the chief executive of the Rhodes Trust, said in a telephone interview. Theres never been an increase like this before.The number of scholarships awarded each year will rise to 95 from 83, an increase that includes four new scholarships for Chinese students, announced last year. The number of Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford at any time will rise to about 250, from around 220.The announcement comes amid international, mostly negative, scrutiny of Cecil Rhodes, the 19th-century British diamond-mining magnate and imperialist who helped establish white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He endowed the scholarships in his will.Last year, a movement at the University of Cape Town under the slogan Rhodes Must Fall galvanized protests across South Africa, drawing attention to persistent racial inequalities in the countrys higher education system more than two decades after the end of apartheid.At Oxford, a South African Rhodes scholar led a movement to have a statue of Rhodes removed from Oriel College, Rhodess alma mater. Oriel, one of Oxfords 38 largely self-governing colleges, said in January that the statue would remain but promised to provide a clear historical context to explain why it is there.Asked if the announcement on Wednesday was timed to address those controversies, Mr. Conn said, Not at all.The trust wasnt set up to be the guardian of Cecil Rhodess political legacy, but to identify really talented people to fight the worlds fights, he said, noting that Rhodes alumni included the Jamaican statesman Norman W. Manley; the South African anti-apartheid activist Bram Fischer; Lucy Banda Sichone, a Zambian educator and human rights advocate; and many others who have fought colonialism and racism.Were about Rhodes scholars, Mr. Conn said. Were not about this historical character  any more than the Nobel Prizes are about Alfred Nobel, who was an arms manufacturer.When the scholarships were introduced, there were 57 each year: 32 for the United States, 20 for various parts of what was then the British Empire (and later the Commonwealth), and five for Germany. (There have been Rhodes scholars from Ghana, Malaysia and Nigeria in the past, but those scholarships were stopped because of political interference or economic problems.)The scholarships  each is worth about 55,000 pounds, or around $79,000, a year  are good for two to four years and cover tuition, fees and a stipend. The scholars study for masters and doctoral degrees, although a few scholars, notably Bill Clinton, did not finish their degrees.Also on Wednesday, the Rhodes Trust announced a partnership worth 75 million, or about $108 million, with the Atlantic Philanthropies, a time-limited foundation established by Charles F. Feeney, who made his billions in duty-free stores and has vowed to give away nearly all his money.The foundation will pay for an Atlantic Institute at Rhodes House to convene scholars, activists, writers, government officials and others  in areas like neuroscience, public health and global inequality  to share knowledge, and will create a new award, the Rhodes Fellowships, to support midcareer professionals working on topics of public concern."}
{"text": "Exploitation cinema is a sleazy United Nations. Its membership includes blaxploitation (Foxy Brown), Ozploitation (Dead End Drive-In from Australia), European nunsploitation (Killer Nun) and other internationally NSFW categories unpalatable for family reading.But sex is the mother of all ploitations. Sexploitation has been around since men (and yes, its mostly men) first learned how to turn on a camera and watch women (and yes, its mostly women) get naked and do something ridiculous (or violent). A genre rooted in nudie reels of the silent era, sexploitation had its golden age in the 1960s as the sexual revolution pushed the boundaries of cinematic depictions of nudity. Around 1970, the birth of hard-core pornography made sexploitation mainstream, prompting its demise.Theaters then that were showing sexploitation closed or had to make the jump to hard-core, and thats where the bubble burst, Frank Henenlotter, a director and exploitation film historian, said in a phone interview. Sexploitation is about tease and how much we are almost going to see something. The moment you show it, the sexploitation game is over.The genre is the subject of a documentary, Thats Sexploitation!, which arrived recently on video from Severin Films. The film covers a wide and sometimes shockingly bizarre range of sex-centered independent filmmaking. Its told almost entirely through footage from the archives of Something Weird Video, a Seattle-based distributor of exploitation genres, and directed and narrated by Mr. Henenlotter. Interspersed are interviews with the old-school showman producer David F. Friedman before his death in 2011.Sexploitation production took place in Los Angeles and New York, with Florida and Texas also churning out pictures. By the 1960s, there were so many films that the genre had its own distribution circuit and exhibitors. A hotbed of highbrow it wasnt.These films were made by businessmen, not artists, Mr. Henenlotter said. The point was if you have a camera and you can get some naked girls in front of the camera, you would make some dollars.What else is new? Without sexploitation, there would be no Spring Breakers, Showgirls or other films that skirt the boundaries of sex and taste, with producers in search of box-office gravy. Today, many sexploitation films are largely forgotten. Here are four subgenres worth noting.Before King Kong, there was Ingagi. A scandalous sensation in 1930 (that other ape wouldnt hit New York until 1933), Ingagi purported to be a documentary about an expedition in the Belgian Congo, ending with a gorilla abducting a female member of an African tribe for sex.Promoted in theater lobbies with jungle-themed decorations, the film probably earned about $4 million, according to the cinema historian Andrew Erish. After an investigation prompted by complaints to the Better Business Bureau, the film was found to have been shot in California with actors, including a man in a gorilla suit and a baby adorned with patches of glued-on fur.Ingagi spawned Forbidden Adventure and a handful of other gorilla-and-the-maiden films, as Mr. Friedman calls them in Thats Sexploitation!,, that perpetuated racist and colonialist notions of Africa. They dont show sex scenes as we know them, but they show the gorillas carrying the women away, Mr. Henenlotter said. In most cases, the women dont complain about that.Somebody goes to a nudist camp, and they like it is how Mr. Henenlotter summed up this subgenres plots, promoted as ostensible docudramas about the lifestyles of sun-kissed sun worshipers. Taking a cue from European nudist camp films of the 1930s, these pictures featured men and women enjoying sports, swimming and sunbathing. There was no sex, but breasts were everywhere.With titles like My Bare Lady and Garden of Eden, the films were shot at nudist campgrounds, skirting laws against onscreen nudity. If you showed a naked woman inside a nudist camp, the court said thats acceptable, Mr. Henenlotter said. If you showed her walking down the street, they would say thats an obscenity.Nudist-camp films arent to be confused with nudie cuties, 60s sexploitation films in which breasts were the plot, he said.A brutal side of sexploitation emerged in these white slavery films, directed by Joseph P. Mawra and featuring a villainously sadistic character named Olga, played by Audrey Campbell. Olga was introduced in White Slaves of Chinatown, in which she procures women to become prostitutes, using drugs and torture to beat her captives into submission. Its an hour spent in as dark and gloomy a gutter as you can imagine, Mr. Henenlotter said.The Russian-sounding name of the titular villainess reflected the eras Cold War anxieties. What clean-cut American would do that kind of stuff? Mr. Henenlotter asked.This hatched Olgas Girls and Olgas House of Shame, also starring Ms. Campbell. She was replaced in two subsequent films, Olgas Massage Parlor and Olgas Dance Hall Girls. Mr. Henenlotter said these disturbing films tapped into male sexual resentments in post-Eisenhower America.These were made for frustrated lonely old men, he said. In some ways, they enjoyed getting their frustrations played out onscreen. Its an ugly thing. Youre not going to see an Olga film because youre in a good mood.Sexploitation looked to lesbians for titillation and shock. But in this purported documentary, their relationships were treated as real and valuable. Made four years before the Stonewall riots by the same producers responsible for the Olga series, Chained Girls explores butch-femme pairings and features a lesbian wedding when such a thing was unthinkable. (A subject that only a short time ago was talked about in low whispers, as the narrator explains.) Not that the filmmakers aspirations were political.These were films about lesbians made by guys who didnt care about lesbians, Mr. Henenlotter said. They cared about showing two girls doing it rather than one girl and a guy."}
{"text": "Bonnie, the tropical storm that drenched the Carolinas over Memorial Day weekend, did not reach hurricane status. But that storm, and the official start of the 2016 hurricane season on Wednesday, make this a good time for homeowners to check their insurance policies to see what is covered if a big storm hits.In coastal states, damage caused by hurricanes or, in some cases, named storms, is often subject to a separate deductible  an amount deducted from the check the insurer writes to the homeowner when a claim is paid. Special storm deductibles emerged in the mid-1990s, after insurers experienced large losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and they have become more prevalent in the wake of continued costly storms.Now, homeowner policies in 19 states and the District of Columbia have some version of storm deductibles. (The states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.)If you live in one of those states, its a good idea to check your coverage. Bonnie, which forced highway closings because of floods, provided a really good reminder that its time to revisit your insurance policy, said Russ Dubisky, executive director of the South Carolina Insurance Association, an industry group.Homeowner policies usually have flat deductibles  say, $500 or $1,000  for losses like theft or damage from a fire. Hurricane deductibles work differently. They are usually set as a percentage of the homes insured value  typically, 1 to 5 percent, or even as much as 10 percent in some areas. On a $250,000 policy, a 1 percent deductible would be $2,500.Typically, the insurer will specify a trigger for the deductible in the policy  like a declaration of a hurricane or named storm by the National Weather Service. Triggers may vary by state and by insurer. The policy also defines a time period during which the deductible applies.Usually, information on special storm deductibles can be found on the main declarations page of an insurance policy, which provides details on coverage limits, exclusions and the like. But sometimes it takes a bit of hunting to find the deductible language, said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer group.It used to be simple, and you had one flat deductible, Ms. Bach said, but no longer, since insurers are seeking to manage costs by shifting risk to consumers. Some policies may have separate percentage deductibles for wind and hail damage that apply even if there is no major named storm, she said.Ms. Bach advises contacting the insurer to ask specifically about what a policy covers, and to be a bit more probing about how the policys deductibles work when shopping for coverage.Have that conversation, she said. Ask, If I had a loss, what cash is this policy going to generate for me?Here are some questions and answers about hurricane coverage: Are there programs to help with the cost of my hurricane deductible?A few states, including Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina, offer a state tax break for funds set aside in a catastrophe savings account, which can be used to cover the deductible in the event of damage from a major storm. Funds put into the account, along with any interest earned, may be deductible on a state tax return. The accounts have so far not proved wildly popular, Mr. Dubisky said, in part because interest rates on savings accounts remain so low. Check with your state insurance department for details. What type of storm damage does my homeowner policy typically cover?Standard homeowner policies cover wind damage from tropical storms and hurricanes, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Damage from water blown into your house through a wind-damaged roof would probably be covered, but flood damage from a storm surge would not. To be covered for flood damage, you need a special policy that can be bought through the National Flood Insurance Program, or from some private insurers. There is usually a 30-day waiting period from the time you buy the flood policy until coverage takes effect. What is the forecast for this years hurricane season?The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week said it expected a near normal season. But that may mean an increase in storms, since hurricane activity has been down for the last three years. The agency predicts a 70 percent chance of 10 to 16 named storms, of which four to eight could become hurricanes, including one to four major hurricanes. The hurricane season lasts for six months, through the end of November."}
{"text": "A fired police officer was charged Wednesday in the killing of a legally armed black musician who had apparently thrown his weapon and was running away when he was shot, prosecutors and court documents said. The former officer, Nouman Raja, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and manslaughter in the Oct. 18 death of Corey Jones, 31, after a grand jury found the shooting was unjustified, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said. Mr. Joness sport utility vehicle had broken down on a highway ramp. He had gotten out and was on the phone with roadside assistance when Mr. Raja, who is of South Asian descent, pulled up in an unmarked van. The mens exchange was captured on the call center recording. At no time during the recording did Raja say he was a police officer, the affidavit said. Instead, Raja replied by asking the single word Really? when Jones twice said, Im good.  Both men apparently pulled guns. Mr. Raja, 38, fired six shots, hitting Mr. Jones three times. Mr. Jones never fired. (AP)A jury has awarded $22 million to a man who says he was beaten by an East Cleveland police detective, locked in a storage closet with no toilet for four days and given nothing to eat or drink except a carton of milk. The Cleveland jury found in favor of the man, Arnold Black, 48, of East Cleveland, in a civil trial. Relatives testified that Mr. Black had to have surgery to remove dried blood on his brain. The trial was held without lawyers representing East Cleveland. City Law Director Willa Hemmons, when contacted Wednesday, said she was not aware that a trial had been held. It is unclear how cash-strapped East Cleveland could pay anything as officials there consider filing the states first-ever municipal bankruptcy and explore a merger with neighboring Cleveland. (AP)"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The same harsh politics that have spawned obituaries for President Obamas signature trade agreement between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations could actually help win its ratification in Congress in a lame-duck vote late this year, advocates are hoping.The cause of free and open trade has not faced such political toxicity in decades, with Donald J. Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all openly hostile to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade accord in history. But supporters seemingly perverse calculation is this: The certainty that Mr. Obamas successor would abandon the agreement gives new impetus for advocates to begin maneuvering toward a vote before 2017.That dynamic, along with recent behind-the-scene developments assuaging some fence-sitters concerns  on Japanese pork subsidies, Mexican labor rights and financial companies data, notably  is keeping hope alive for advocates from the White House to the Republican-controlled Congress, and in pro-trade business and agriculture groups.Right now you have a president, a majority leader and a speaker who are all pro-trade, Mr. Obamas trade ambassador, Michael B. Froman, said in an interview, reflecting a seize-the-moment recognition of the changed lineup ahead.He is not alone in that reckoning, although many people in both parties declined to be quoted by name given the tenuous politics of the issue. Besides a new president, the Senate could have a new majority leader next year, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, if Democrats win control, and he is unlikely to promote an issue that so divides the union-friendly party.There is a pathway forward here, Mr. Froman said. And what were trying to do right now is just maximize the likelihood that well be able to walk down that path successfully.Whether that is wishful thinking or a real prospect will have to come into focus well before November because supporters would likely need to begin congressional hearings in September to clear the path for a vote in the lame-duck session of Congress after Election Day.And the forces do seem aligned against the pacts approval.Months ago, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who is pro-trade but worried about keeping Republican seats, ruled out a vote before the election. The so-called T.P.P. would phase out thousands of tariffs, open markets and impose new trade rules, including for labor rights and environmental standards, on signatory nations that span both sides of the Pacific, including Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, Chile and Mexico.And Mrs. Clinton appears to have put her finger on the scale against a vote in the lame-duck session. Asked by an anti-T.P.P. group if she would oppose a lame-duck vote on the accord if elected, Mrs. Clinton responded, I have said I oppose the T.P.P. agreement  and that means before and after the election.Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, House Democrats point person on trade, was blunt. T.P.P. cannot pass this session as negotiated, he said.There were always major problems as they negotiated it, he added, so I dont want people to think its simply because of the presidential race.Indeed, Mr. Obama acknowledged he faced an uphill push when the agreement, in the works since the George W. Bush administration, was announced in October. The hostility toward trade agreements has built over decades as manufacturing jobs shifted overseas and middle-income wages stagnated.Those politics have only grown more toxic, stoked by anti-trade blasts from Mr. Trump in the Republicans nomination contest and Mr. Sanders in his challenge to the Democrats front-runner, Mrs. Clinton. Pressured by Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton turned on the agreement she had praised as the gold standard during negotiations.Not since the Depression has a Republican nominee opposed free trade and favored high tariffs on imports, but Mr. Trumps hard line potentially threatens Mrs. Clintons support in manufacturing states. He has called the Pacific agreement the biggest betrayal in a long line of betrayals where politicians have sold out U.S. workers  a stance that separates him from the Republican Partys highest-ranking elected official, pro-trade Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who so far has declined to endorse Mr. Trump.Mrs. Clinton, by her stand, has forsaken the New Democrat trade legacy that her husband as president and now Mr. Obama forged for their less-than-receptive party by introducing labor, human rights and environmental protections into trade agreements.Trade supporters have long counted on action in a lame-duck Congress. But they did not count on Mr. Trump being the nominee. His election could likely doom the accord, T.P.P. advocates concede, by dissuading Republican leaders from advancing an issue their partys standard-bearer so opposes. But some Republicans do not rule out a vote, because, they say, the deal deserves consideration or because Mr. Trump will not be elected.Even a lame-duck strategy necessitates some action before the election. Under the terms of trade legislation that helped Mr. Obama complete the accord, Congress must hold public hearings on the agreement before it is voted on, and a lame-duck session would not provide enough time for committee action and House and Senate debates.Mr. Obama, in Vietnam recently, predicted that Congress would ratify the accord. A big reason for administration confidence is that Congress a year ago narrowly voted to give the president so-called trade-promotion authority, which puts T.P.P. on a legislative fast track, ruling out amendments and requiring just 51 votes in the Senate, not 60.And with T.P.P. in hand, supporters are pointing to potential gains for American exporters. We think theres some opportunity to pick up some people, given the specific benefits to their districts, Mr. Froman said.For example, supporters hope the strong backing of beef producers and other agriculture groups will hold down defections among House Republicans in rural districts who fear Mr. Trumps backlash.T.P.P. is going to take our tariff rate from 38 percent to 9 percent for American beef sold in Japan, said Kent Bacus, director of international trade for the National Cattlemens Beef Association. That would erase Australias advantage in Japan since the two nations reached a separate trade agreement last year, costing American exporters roughly $300 million in market share.Agriculture groups will hold pro-T.P.P. events in lawmakers districts this summer, Mr. Bacus said. Theyre going to listen to their constituents. Were not going away, he said.Mr. Froman for months has been meeting with lawmakers to address their complaints and with other nations trade ministers, to goad their countries to act on their T.P.P. commitments now  on labor rights, for example  so that he can reassure Congresss doubters.Mexicos president recently sent legislation to his Congress that would address American complaints about its restrictions on unions. Such reforms have been a priority of Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the pro-trade lead Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee responsible for T.P.P., although they are unlikely to satisfy most American unions.Just last week, the administration, the financial services industry and its backers in Congress settled on a policy addressing other nations requirements for local storage of companies financial data abroad. The administration also has allayed concerns among dairy groups and among pork producers concerned about new subsidies in Japan for its industry.That leaves one main issue to settle, supporters say, over provisions reducing American pharmaceutical companies monopoly control of advanced drugs known as biologics. The industry opposes the change and has a prime ally: Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee.In a statement, Mr. Hatch said, If the president wants T.P.P. to be approved, he will need to work with Congress to address concerns. Im hopeful that, at the end of the day, I, along with many of my colleagues, will be able to support a strong T.P.P.His House counterpart, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, in a statement extolled the agreement. But he said he would continue to work with the administration to resolve members outstanding concerns."}
{"text": "The pioneering label Stax Records is best known for gritty, down-and-dirty soul classics by such giants as Otis Redding, Rufus Thomas, and Sam and Dave. But one of the singles that first put the Memphis company on the map was the stately, elegant ballad You Dont Miss Your Water, written and recorded in 1961 by a rising local singer named William Bell. Though the song only grazed the charts, it was a defining cornerstone of the Southern soul sound.The next year, though, Mr. Bell was drafted into the military, and by the time he was discharged in 1965, Stax had an established lineup of stars. He remained a part of the label until it shuttered in 1975  most notably, as a writer of Born Under a Bad Sign for Albert King in 1967  but never quite regained his position as one of the Memphis elite.This week, Mr. Bell is releasing This Is Where I Live, his first album in more than a decade. It also represents his return to Stax, which was revived as an imprint by Concord Records in 2004. (He will be performing at the Cutting Room on Tuesday and at MetroTech Commons next Thursday as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Musics Rhythm and Blues Festival series.)Over lunch in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Bell, 76, looked fit and dapper, dressed in shades of brown and tan. Remarkably, he was staying in the same Times Square hotel where he wrote You Dont Miss Your Water while feeling homesick on tour more than 50 years ago. (He sang it at the White House in 2013 in a tribute to Memphis soul.) Mr. Bell claimed that even if the new Stax involved a different team in a different location, he felt a certain accountability about putting out music under the legendary logo.We created a new genre, and its a responsibility to uphold that and also try to bring it forward a little bit, he said. As kids, we never thought that Stax would stop going, and then when it folded, it was devastating to us. So to have it come back, I dont take it lightly.John Leventhal, who produced the album, said in a phone interview that he immediately sensed what he did and didnt want to do with Mr. Bell. I knew it shouldnt be overtly nostalgic, or just a pastiche of clichs, said Mr. Leventhal, best known for his work with his wife, Rosanne Cash, and such singer-songwriters as Shawn Colvin and Michelle Branch. We werent trying to drag William back to the glory days, but to appropriate older styles and make them more vibrant for today.Mr. Bell was truly a team player during Staxs glory days, writing songs and contributing to sessions by other artists while continuing to cut sophisticated, emotional tracks that are still treasured by soul aficionados, including Everybody Loves a Winner, I Forgot to Be Your Lover and Private Number. His compositions had a melancholy feel and narrative structure that veered close to country music and proved influential in Memphis and Nashville.Because he could write, William became a henchman at the label, one of the hubs in the wheel  a go-to guy, said Booker T. Jones of Booker T. & the MGs, the Stax house band, and a frequent co-writer, in a telephone interview. He was an innovator as a singer. He set the standard for Percy Sledge and all the people who sang with heart and soul and feeling.After the demise of Stax, Mr. Bell moved to Atlanta. He never left music  he started a production company and a label, and had his biggest hit in 1977 with Tryin to Love Two. His songs have been covered by Billy Idol and sampled by Kanye West and Ludacris; he also took acting lessons and even played Stanley Kowalski in a production of A Streetcar Named Desire.All of his experiences inform the songs on This Is Where I Live. He and Mr. Leventhal pointed to the albums opener, The Three of Me, as being indicative of the mature direction they wanted to pursue.Its more introspective, Mr. Bell said. Its still about love, but not the passion of a younger guy. Its an older guy reflecting. Mr. Leventhal added that they developed material that would be compelling for a 75-year-old man  its not becoming of a great singer to sing something they would have done 50 years earlier.Though his songwriting was always characterized by a graceful simplicity, Mr. Bell continues to refine his work. Theres a calmness now with my demeanor, he said. Im able to express myself better now than I did as a teenager. Ive traveled the world; I have a better perspective on life, on people, on my career. Im very fortunate  a lot of my peers are gone, and its very gratifying to have lasted this long, still intact.Inevitably, though, he continues to look back on his days as part of one of Americas most mythic musical communities. He admits to some disappointment with his initial run at Stax but lights up talking about visiting Reddings Georgia ranch or recording with Booker T. & the MGs, two members of whom he knew from church.It really was like an extended family, he said. Long before integration, we got behind those walls at Stax, and the only thing that mattered was what you brought to the table in terms of talent and creativity. We didnt care about race, gender, whatever.Being so young, it was like going to university, he continued. We honed our craft in that building and learned about the intricacies of music and songwriting and how to express an idea. So for me to come full circle and sign with Stax again, it feels like home."}
{"text": "It was happy hour at Fig, an upscale restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif., and three friends were enjoying lively conversation and a platter of charcuterie when an odd expression fell across the face of one of the women.That guy just put something in her drink, Monica Kenyon told her friends, staring at another diner.And so it began, a narrative of crime-stopping that lit up social media after it was described in detail on Facebook:  How Ms. Kenyon and the other women on May 26 foiled what they thought was a strangers plan to drug and possibly rape his date.On Tuesday, the man, Michael Hsu, 24, was charged with two felonies: administering a drug and assault with intent to commit a sex crime, the district attorneys office said in a statement.GUESS WHO STOPPED A RAPE LAST NIGHT?! THESE GALS! Sonia Ulrich, one of the women at the restaurant, wrote.The account was accompanied by a photograph of Ms. Ulrich, Ms. Kenyon and Marla Saltzer posing in what looked like a scene from Charlies Angels: defensive crouch, arms outstretched and hands in karate-chopping or pistol-packing mode.Dont roofie someone on our watch, the photo caption reads, referring to the so-called date rape drug Rohypnol.Ms. Ulrich wrote that while the photograph may seem to be making light of a heavy situation, This is no joking matter.Indeed, the Los Angeles District Attorneys Office said a possible date-drugging case had been thwarted by three good Samaritans.In recounting the events on Facebook, Ms. Ulrich said she and her companion, Ms. Kenyon, had gone with Ms. Saltzer to the restaurant at the Fairmont Hotel for happy hour. At one point, Ms. Ulrich noticed Ms. Kenyon making a funny face.What had caught her attention? A man nearby had just slipped something into his companions drink, Ms. Ulrich wrote:He pulled her glass toward him, kind of awkwardly, then he took out a little black vial. He opened it up and dropped something in. Then he tried to play it cool, like checking his phone and hiding the vial in his hand and then trying to bring it back down slyly.Ms. Ulrich continued: Now, Fig is a nice restaurant. We were enjoying our charcuterie platter and some fancy cheeses. That type of place.She wrote that the couple had a bottle of wine they were splitting.It seemed like a first or second or third date, she said.The mans dinner companion had gone to the restroom.After a few Oh God. What do we dos, I got up to find her in the bathroom to tell her. Warn her. Tell her to get up and leave this creep. Make him drink it. Something, Ms. Ulrich wrote.She awkwardly loitered by the sinks in the bathroom, waiting to speak to the woman. I approached: Hey! Um, this is kind of weird, but, uh, we saw the guy you were with put something in your drink. Oh, my God, the woman replied.Asked how well she knew the man, the woman said: Hes one of my best friends. They worked together and had known each other for more than a year.Ms. Ulrich returned to her table, where she and the other women spoke to a server and others, and security was informed of what they had witnessed. The man apparently noticed Ms. Kenyon watching him, Ms. Ulrich wrote. It was not immediately clear on Wednesday what type of drug was allegedly used.Remarkably, the woman returning to the table, ordered sparkling water, and sat through 40 more minutes with her companion. The man tried several times chinking his glass to hers to get her to drink, Ms. Ulrich wrote. She played it cool.When the couple finished dinner, the server told them that a computer problem was causing a delay with the bill. The extra time allowed the security workers to review video footage, and the police were called.Officers from the Santa Monica Police Department arrived and approached the man. They say, Come with us, and he doesnt protest, Ms. Ulrich wrote. Doesnt ask why. Doesnt seem surprised. The police took the womans glass as evidence.We asked the girl if she had a ride home, Ms. Ulrich wrote. The woman replied: My car is at his place. In his building. We came together.In court Tuesday, Mr. Hsu pleaded not guilty, and his next court date is June 14, Greg Risling, a spokesman for the district attorneys office, said in an email. The recommended bail of $1 million was reduced to $350,000 for Mr. Hsu, he said.If convicted, he would face a maximum of six years in state prison, the statement by the district attorney office said. The case remains under investigation, it said."}
{"text": "Facing a United Nations commitment to start airdropping aid to civilians in rebel-held areas, the Syrian government eased some limits on humanitarian truck convoys on Wednesday and allowed one into a deprived Damascus suburb blockaded since 2012.Despite appearances of a relaxation, however, international aid workers, opposition figures and Western officials said the aid deliveries, conducted by the United Nations and the Red Cross, were minimal and contained no urgently needed food.Britains top diplomat described the convoys as a cynical gesture by the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and suggested that the promised airdrops would soon begin. One government opponent called the truck deliveries farcically small.A five-truck convoy to Daraya, a rebellious Damascus suburb that had been denied deliveries for more than three years, contained some wheelchairs and a few dozen boxes of items like infant formula, vaccines, mosquito nets and anti-lice shampoo, according to residents reached by telephone and the internet.Another aid convoy was allowed into the nearby town of Moadamiya, which had not received any supplies for a month. Other deprived areas where insurgent groups are ensconced received nothing.Some aid charities said the deliveries seemed designed to avert, or at least postpone, airdrops of food and other supplies to parts of the country hostile to Mr. Assad, who is entangled in the sixth year of a war that has left vast sections of Syria devastated or beyond his control.Mr. Assad has made clear that he does not want to give any relief to his enemies or to civilians sympathetic to them.You cant hide the fact that this isnt the solution, said Christy Delafield, a spokeswoman for Mercy Corps, which helps displaced Syrian civilians. She described the deliveries as tiny amounts of aid that are let in after long battles.In a statement, Mercy Corps said that deliveries of aid continue to be rejected, delayed or tampered with  leaving the most vulnerable communities still in need.Videos posted by opposition groups, which could not be independently corroborated, appeared to show that the deliveries to Daraya were skimpy.Mohammed A. Ghanem, a senior political adviser for the Syrian American Council, an anti-Assad group in Washington, said the videos showed that no aid, or at least a farcically small amount of aid, has been delivered by land.He and other opposition figures exhorted the United Nations to make good on the pledge to begin airdrops.Wednesday had been regarded as a potentially decisive moment in the protracted effort by the United Nations and other groups to send food and medicine to the many thousands of Syrian civilians isolated by the war  an important preliminary step toward any possible peace agreement.The International Syria Support Group, a multinational organization that includes Russia and the United States, agreed last month that Mr. Assad must stop blocking access to areas held by his adversaries.Otherwise, the group pledged to help the World Food Program, the main food agency of the United Nations, airdrop emergency supplies starting as early as Wednesday.Russias participation in that pledge was regarded as significant, because the Russians are Mr. Assads most important foreign allies and have been helping his forces on the battlefield for the past nine months.Clearly the regime is seeking to defuse the pressure that would have been exerted on it as of today, said Bassma Kodmani, a member of the High Negotiations Committee, an opposition group that has been engaged in on-again, off-again political talks with Mr. Assads government, moderated by the United Nations.In a telephone interview from Paris, Ms. Kodmani said that Russias endorsement of emergency airdrops might have played a role in providing some relief to Daraya, but that one convoy is obviously not a sign of the end of the starvation strategy.The Red Cross and the United Nations relief coordination agency were among the first to publicize via Twitter the aid delivery to Daraya.Darayas plight was evident last month when an aid convoy that had tried to enter the city was blocked for hours and ultimately turned away despite pledges by the Syrian government. Crowds of deprived residents had gathered to await the delivery.Whether airdrops of aid will now proceed remained unclear.Stphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman in New York, said that airdrops were under consideration but that he had no information on when or where they might begin. He said a meeting of humanitarian officials would assess the situation on Thursday.The real issue here, what we want to see, is a lifting of all the sieges, Mr. Dujarric told reporters in response to questions about the aid deliveries.We want to see unlimited access and were not seeing it, he said. At the same time, he warned that airdrops of aid, particularly in conflict areas, were a very challenging operation.Britain, however, suggested that they could begin soon.The countrys foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said in a statement that Mr. Assads government had cynically allowed limited amounts of aid into Daraya and Moadamiya but it has failed to deliver the widespread humanitarian access called for by the international community.While airdrops are costly and risky, Mr. Hammond said, they are now the last resort to relieve human suffering across many besieged areas."}
{"text": "LONDON  The main investment bankers involved in the merger between Deutsche Brse and the London Stock Exchange worked at one of Wall Streets biggest companies, Morgan Stanley, the last time the two exchanges flirted with the idea of getting married.Today, the bankers are no longer at Morgan Stanley. Rather, in a sign of the fast-changing landscape on Wall Street, they compete with their old company, operating out of boutique investment banks that did not even exist in late 2004, when the two exchanges last tangoed.Perella Weinberg Partners, one of whose founders is Joseph R. Perella, a former head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley, is leading a clutch of banks representing the Deutsche Brse.The main banker for the London Stock Exchange is Simon Robey, who was co-chairman of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley and today runs his own firm, Robey Warshaw.A onetime rival for the London Stock Exchange  Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE  was helped by Caroline Silver, the former head of Morgan Stanleys European financial institutions group. Ms. Silver, who is now at Moelis & Company, was working with her former employer to upend the talks between the Deutsche Brse and the London Stock Exchange. ICE said recently that it would not make an offer for the London exchange.This decade-old diaspora from Morgan Stanley clustered around one deal underscores the changing market for merger advice. Increasingly, boutique and independent investment banks have prospered as companies turn to them instead of the big global banks.Without even counting the potential fees on the London Stock Exchange deal, boutique and independent companies represented 30.5 percent of the $5.35 billion in completed merger fees in the first quarter of this year, according to Thomson Reuters, which tracks corporate finance activity.Last year, of the $26.1 billion in fees that were paid to Wall Street for merger deals, 31.3 percent went to boutique and independent investment banks, compared with 23.8 percent in 2005, when the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Brse last flirted with merging.The shift is remarkable particularly for a company like Morgan Stanley, which for much of its history prided itself on taking a firm public and then catering to all its banking needs, like raising debt or providing additional equity financing and advising on mergers and takeovers.Decades ago, when young bankers joined Morgan Stanley, executives would trot out one of the companys oldest clients, the telecommunications giant AT&T, as an illustration of the kind of company Morgan Stanley served.We did almost everything for them, recalled Scott Moeller, who was an investment banker at Morgan Stanley from the early 80s to 1996 and is now director of the M.&A. Research Center at the City University Londons Cass Business School.The more specialized advisory banks may be gaining, but Morgan Stanley is still a powerhouse, showing the durability of the global giants. Last year, the investment bank ranked No. 2 in worldwide mergers and acquisitions, with a market share of 29 percent in announced deals, behind Goldman Sachs with 34 percent of the market, according to Thomson Reuters.Morgan Stanley did not advise either the London Stock Exchange or Deutsche Brse when they tried to merge in 2004. But after the French-born Xavier Rolet, a former Lehman Brothers executive, was appointed chief executive of the London exchange in 2009, he met with Mr. Robey, who also headed Morgan Stanleys British operations.Over the next few years, Mr. Robey helped Mr. Rolet frame his vision for the London Stock Exchange. In 2011, he assisted Mr. Rolet in orchestrating the London exchanges acquisition of the 50 percent stake in FTSE International that it did not already own. That same year, he also advised on the failed merger attempt by the London Stock Exchange and the TMX Group, the parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange.Their relationship deepened after Mr. Robey, 55, left Morgan Stanley in January 2013. He later teamed up with Simon Warshaw, former co-head of investment banking at UBS, to start a new firm.Robey Warshaw has only 14 employees. It takes up four floors of a stately Georgian townhouse on St. James Place in London; one of its neighbors is the British banker Jacob Rothschild. But last year, Robey Warshaw was ranked No. 16 in announced global mergers and acquisitions with a 4.5 percent market share.Mr. Robey and Mr. Rolet forged a friendship.In the summer of 2014, Mr. Rolet invited Mr. Robey to visit him at his vineyard in Provence, France. During the trip, Mr. Robey joined other guests of Mr. Rolets at a performance of Nabucco, an opera by Verdi that was part of a summer opera festival held in an ancient Roman theater north of Avignon.As a young man, Mr. Robey nearly pursued a career as a professional singer. He attended Oxford University on a choral scholarship. Today, he indulges his passion for music by overseeing the board of trustees at the Royal Opera House in Londons Covent Garden.In November 2014, when Mr. Robey remarried, Mr. Rolet and his wife, Nicole, attended his wedding.In the case of Perella Weinberg, it was actually a Goldman Sachs alumnus that cemented ties with Deutsche Brses new chief executive, Carsten Kengeter.When Peter A. Weinberg was chief executive of Goldman Sachs International in London more than a decade ago, he got to know Mr. Kengeter, a fast-rising fixed-income executive in Goldmans Frankfurt offices.The two kept up with each other when Mr. Weinberg left Goldman to start a merger advisory boutique with Mr. Perella.As it happens, Mr. Weinberg was also at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. But he did not overlap with Mr. Perella, who joined the bank in 1993. The two men knew each other because Mr. Perella had gone to Harvard Business School on a scholarship established by Mr. Weinbergs grandfather, Sidney J. Weinberg.In the early days of Perella Weinberg, when some Wall Street rivals sniffed at the new banking upstart, Mr. Kengeter was welcoming. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Kengeter and his boss, Oswald Grbel, the chief executive of UBS at the time, invited Mr. Perella and Mr. Weinberg to an investment bankers dream: a dinner with some of UBSs biggest clients.Andrew Bednar, a merger banker for Perella Weinberg in New York, had also developed a relationship with some of the executives at Deutsche Brse.Several years ago, a former Goldman partner, Duncan L. Niederauer, who at the time was chief executive of NYSE Euronext, hired Perella Weinberg to work on a plan to create the worlds biggest exchange by marrying the New York exchange with Deutsche Brse. Even though European Union regulators vetoed the deal in February 2012, Mr. Bednar became better acquainted with the Deutsche Brse team during the friendly merger talks.In late 2012, when ICE announced that it would acquire the New York Stock Exchange, leaving Perella Weinberg without a client in the exchange arena, Mr. Bednar began courting Deutsche Brse.In June 2015, soon after Mr. Kengeter took over as chief executive of Deutsche Brse, Mr. Weinberg sat down with him. Like any new chief executive, Mr. Kengeter charged his team with thinking about the exchanges future and areas of exploration. Later that summer, Mr. Bednar also met with Mr. Kengeter on a trip to Frankfurt.The meetings were a prelude to a get-together between Mr. Kengeter and Mr. Rolet, who knew each other, having both worked in Europe for Goldman Sachs.Left out, now that ICE has decided against making a counterbid, is Ms. Silver, who was behind some of the biggest mergers between exchanges, including advising the New York Stock Exchange Euronext on its acquisition by ICE several years ago."}

Why or why not? If youd known it was a prank, would that have changed your answer? Why?In Is It Art? Eyeglasses on Museum Floor Began as Teenagers Prank, Christopher Mele writes:Two California teenagers who recently visited the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art were less than impressed by some of the exhibits and wondered if they could do better.And thus a scheme was hatched: They placed a pair of eyeglasses on the floor, stood back and watched as, within minutes, visitors regarded their prank as a work of art, with some even taking photos of the fake installation.The teenagers, Kevin Nguyen, 16, and TJ Khayatan, 17, both of San Jose, had been left scratching their heads at the simplicity of some of the museums exhibits, including two stuffed animals on a blanket.Is this really what you call art? Kevin said in an interview over the weekend.TJ added, We looked at it and we were like, This is pretty easy. We could make this ourselves.Inspired during their visit on May 21, they experimented with putting a jacket on the floor and then a baseball cap, but neither drew attention.Kevin then placed his Burberry glasses on the floor beneath a placard describing the theme of the gallery. He said neither he nor TJ did anything to influence museum visitors, such as standing around and looking at the glasses.Within about three minutes, people appeared to be viewing their handiwork as bona fide art, though Kevin said that without his glasses, he could not see what was happening too well. teejay (@TJCruda) May 24, 2016Students: Read the article, then tell us  What do you think of this prank in general?

Game 1 will be streamed live on WatchESPN.N.B.A. Finals Game 1 live updatesStephen Curry, for the first time since last years N.B.A. finals, encountered something resembling adversity in the Western Conference finals. The Warriors fell behind, three games to one; he was turning the ball over far too much; and his opponents were mocking his defensive ability. Some fans even questioned his anointment as the games best player.With no margin for error, Curry responded by averaging 32.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.3 steals in the final three games of the series, dismantling the Oklahoma City Thunder.It may be scary for the Cavaliers to think about, but an argument could be made that Curry was only his teams second-best player in that stretch. Klay Thompson, the other half of the so-called Splash Brothers, showed a national audience what Warriors fans have known for years: When his shot is falling, he is as dangerous as his more famous teammate.He and Curry combined for 62 3-pointers against the Thunder, an N.B.A. record for teammates in a playoff series. Thompson averaged 29.7 points in the final three games, and his 41-point performance on the road in Game 6 will perhaps be the most memorable showing of that series.The road to the finals was far less winding for the Cavaliers. They were steamrollering through the East, winning their first 10 playoff games, before a pair of brutal losses to Toronto in the conference finals. It proved to be a mild detour: There was little to no drama in Games 5 and 6, and now LeBron James is set to play in the N.B.A. finals for a sixth consecutive year.At their best, the Cavaliers can nearly keep up with the Warriors in 3-point shooting. That should be the main story line of this showdown, not the overdone notion that James could find redemption by winning a championship for Cleveland.In any case, while the finals will be a rematch of last seasons triumph by the Warriors, both teams have grown. Expecting a shot-for-shot remake would be unwise.The most obvious change for the Cavaliers is the return of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. They played a total of  44 minutes in the N.B.A. finals last year, with Love hampered by a shoulder dislocation and Irving dropping out after Game 1 with an injured knee.Getting back a pair of All-Stars takes some of the burden off James, who single-handedly prevented the Warriors from having a cakewalk to a championship last year but was outdone by the defensive tenacity of Andre Iguodala and the overall offensive excellence of the Warriors.Love and Irving seemed to coexist better with James this season, accepting their roles while occasionally being asked to supply star power on nights when James was not at his best.Love averaged 16 points and 9.9 rebounds a game while shooting 36 percent from 3-point range, and while he is not known as an effective defender, most advanced defensive statistics showed him holding his own this season.Irving averaged 19.6 points and 4.7 assists a game while growing accustomed to the idea of being a point guard who gives up the ball-handling duties in crunchtime to James.The Cavaliers still probably use J. R. Smith and Matthew Dellavedova more than they would prefer, but Channing Frye proved to be a brilliant in-season acquisition, capitalizing on the wide-open looks he gets when James is double-teamed.There is an argument to be made that the Cavaliers are to blame for the Warriors record-breaking 73-win season. With his team looking overmatched and down by two games to one in last years N.B.A. finals, Kerr listened to an unorthodox suggestion from Nick URen, his manager of advanced scouting, and deployed a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Iguodala, Thompson and Curry. Playing a center who is generously listed at 6 feet 7 inches, a power forward who is a slight 6-8 and three guards would seem crazy in nearly any era of basketball, but the group, which came to be known as the Death Lineup, proved to be among the most effective units ever put together.The misconception about the lineup is that it is strictly an offensive ploy to run teams into the ground. While that is certainly a part of the equation, the lineup also features three tremendous defenders in Green, Iguodala and Thompson, and they are a nightmare on both ends of the court. Kerr tends to limit their minutes together to protect Green, who takes abuse from larger centers.Before Curry and Thompson went supernova and saved the Western Conference finals for the Warriors, the Thunder overwhelmed Golden States approach with the size and ferocious attitude of Steven Adams, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter and Kevin Durant. But the Cavaliers do not have the personnel to pull that off. Tristan Thompson is an undersize power forward who is expected to handle the bulk of the rebounding duties. Love, who is listed at 6-10 but was measured at 6-7 at the N.B.A. draft combine, is unlikely to be much of a threat inside against Green.The Cavaliers responded to the Death Lineup last season by essentially burying Timofey Mozgov on the bench, but they may want to give Mozgov, a Russian 7-footer, a second look this time. The Warriors struggle with size, and Green is two technical fouls or one flagrant foul away from a mandatory suspension, meaning his typical strategy of physically assaulting opposing big men will not be in play.The Warriors beat the Cavaliers both times they played this season, but it was the second game, a brutal 132-98 shellacking, that might have cost  David Blatt his job as coach. In that game, Curry went off for 35 points, and Iguodala, the Cavaliers nemesis, had 20 points while shooting 7 for 8 and playing his typical stellar defense.If Blatt was fired for not being able to beat the Warriors, that is somewhat understandable. But it was certainly unusual to see a coach with an 83-40 regular-season record over two seasons fired midway through a campaign in which his team was on track to be the top seed in its conference.The University of Arizona may not be considered a typical N.B.A. feeder program, but this series is an excellent advertisement for what it produced in the Lute Olson era. The 2002-3 Wildcats featured Luke Walton, the Warriors top assistant, along with Iguodala and Frye. Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach, was a four-year player at Arizona, teaming with Bruce Fraser, who in his capacity as Golden States player-development coach serves as Currys shot doctor. The Cavaliers Richard Jefferson joined Walton on the 2001 team that lost the national championship game to Duke, and Bret Brielmaier, a Cavaliers assistant, was a four-year player for the Wildcats.Both teams have efficient offenses, with a heavy reliance on 3-pointers. The big difference between them is pace. The Warriors want to move as quickly as possible while the Cavaliers, regardless of what Coach Tyronn Lue may have wanted when he started coaching them, tend to grind out games at a snails pace.If Cleveland allows Golden State to dictate the speed of the game, the series could be a serious mismatch. The Warriors have a far deeper roster and are more balanced on the defensive side. While Klay Thompson, Green and Iguodala are likely to pose a defensive challenge to Irving, Love and James, it is hard to see anyone on the Cavaliers other than James being much of a threat to the Golden State offense.There is a path to victory for Cleveland that involves turning the series into a slugfest. The hyper-emotional Green is on thin ice with the league and can be temporarily removed as a threat by getting him to lash out just once. Thompson can also be drawn into foul trouble if Cleveland plays things correctly, and Golden State can be exploited with intentional fouls on Festus Ezeli, a comically bad free-throw shooter.The problem, as so many teams have found out, is that the shooting of Curry and Thompson means that almost no lead is safe and that a team must press for all 48 minutes to secure a victory. It sounds simple enough, but Golden States record of 168-34 over the last two seasons, including the playoffs, indicates it is a daunting task.Pick: Warriors in five games"}
{"text": "OTTAWA  Some residents returned to Fort McMurray, Alberta, on Wednesday for the first time since wildfires forced them out and ravaged their city four weeks ago. But it was hardly a triumphant homecoming, as the citys gradual reopening came amid concerns that it was premature.The returning residents, identified by government-issued wristbands, were watched over by more than 300 officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and were given a long list of warnings. Officials told them to keep their gas tanks topped off, and to take at least two weeks worth of food, water, medicine and other essentials with them, because stores and other services in the city have not fully reopened.And many of the 88,000 evacuees have been told that it is still not safe for them to return: older people, children under 7, pregnant women and people with any of a variety of medical conditions.The citys tap water is not drinkable yet, and may not be available for weeks. Other utilities are not back online, either.Many of those who did return on Wednesday were not expected to stay long. Rather, they will most likely check on their homes, retrieve personal items left behind in the haste of evacuation and head south again to await the restoration of something closer to normal life.It may be a long wait. Environmental experts say the ash left by the fire is so caustic and full of toxins that many surviving houses in the worst-hit neighborhoods must be sealed off, probably until September.Given all that, some residents, including members of the local City Council, have questioned the timing of the return. But as crews continued to spray sealant over the ash and rubble, provincial government officials repeatedly assured the public that many people could return safely, if not conveniently.Personally, I would feel quite comfortable to go back, Scott Long, the executive director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, told reporters on Tuesday at a news conference. We didnt work this hard to make sure that people are safe, to bring them back to an unsafe area and leave them to their own devices.Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, agreed with Mr. Longs analysis but warned that returning may not be easy.She observed that, after the panicked evacuation of the city, when some residents drove through tunnels of flame, it is very possible that the re-entry process will be the next most stressful day.Ms. Notley, who has visited the city twice since the fire broke out, added, I think it will be shocking.Provincial officials have said that the government underestimated the emotional and psychological effects of another major fire in 2011, which forced about 7,000 people to evacuate the town of Slave Lake, Alberta, and which ultimately destroyed about one-third of the community. So this time, mental health workers from across Canada have been arriving in Alberta over the past few weeks to help the Fort McMurray evacuees.The wildfire that scorched the city remains out of control and now covers about 1.4 million acres. But for some time, the flames have been moving away from Fort McMurray, deep into largely unpopulated woodlands, and there is little unburned forest left near the city to provide a path for the flames back toward town.As residents retraced the evacuation route up Highway 63, the route to the city, they were greeted by firefighters who had parked two fire trucks on an overpass and suspended a giant Canadian flag, bracketed by provincial and municipal flags, on a rope tied between their raised ladders.Three neighborhoods of Fort McMurray were particularly devastated by the fire. After laboratory analysis of the ash and debris there, some 567 surviving houses and a dozen apartments in or near those neighborhoods have been declared unfit for habitation until a cleanup can be completed.In all, 1,921 buildings were destroyed and 174 damaged by the fire, about 10 percent of the structures in the city. Judging by what could be seen by reporters on a recent tour, the vast majority of lost structures were houses or apartments.Up to 15,000 people were allowed to return beginning on Wednesday, in a gradual process that will continue until Saturday. The most immediate concerns for many will be documenting damage for insurance claims and dealing with rotting food left behind in unpowered refrigerators and freezers. The provincial government has been working with a railroad on a plan for removing masses of appliances contaminated by spoiled food.And while much of the ground in and around the city is blackened and charred, some homeowners in the least-affected parts of town were beating down overgrown lawns on Wednesday.The reopening of the city comes at a time when insurance reimbursements for hotel stays are drying up for many evacuees. Heather Mack, director of government relations for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, an industry group, told reporters on a conference call that coverage for hotel expenses typically runs out after 14 to 30 days. The province has set up a fund to assist evacuees with housing costs that insurance does not cover.Many of those who fled the city have vowed to rebuild. But an economic slump in Alberta, brought about by low oil prices, has led to many job losses and has limited opportunities in what had been Canadas boom town.While some homeowners may be required under the terms of their mortgages to rebuild their homes, Ms. Mack said, many others will be free to take a cash settlement and walk away.Theres some people who might choose that, she said. Somebody whos close to retirement and may want to settle elsewhere."}
{"text": "Motown Gospel Presents 1 Mic 1 Take(Motown Gospel)About five years ago, Capitol Music Group started shooting black-and-white videos of musicians on its various labels, recording at Capitol Music Studios in Los Angeles with minimal fuss. The name of the series is 1 Mic 1 Take, and it started out just as the name promised, with artists from Capitols pop and jazz rosters performing alone. (More recent videos, with extra musicians, seem to be using at least one extra microphone.) All the videos are amiable and useful and are ultimately to be filed alongside NPRs Tiny Desk Concerts and the MTV Unplugged series. Whats being sold is the idea of simplicity as an absolute virtue, an idea that isnt always true; nor is it always true that these musicians would be forbidden anymore from putting stripped-down tracks on their own albums.Motown Gospel, one of Capitols labels, has compiled an album from these sessions with five of its artists: Brian Courtney Wilson, Tasha Cobbs, Myron Butler and Levi, Royce Lovett and Smokie Norful. Many of them brought reflective songs or spiritual ballads for the occasion, and because of that the record grows drowsy. Mr. Wilson puts vocal grit and moods shaded by many piano chords into the Stevie Wonder-like ballad Worth Fighting For. Whereas the young and mellow Mr. Lovetts acoustic-reggae Say Something feels floppy in its lack of polish; you might want to hear a slicker version of him.A few performers tear it up within reduced circumstances. Ms. Cobbs, especially: Her ballad Jesus Saves, with piano and three chorus singers, transcends most conventions. Toward the middle of the track, shes slightly off the ground, her voice ripping; she is playing for an invisible audience. Still, you can hear a dramatic solo performance on a regular gospel record. Whats more unusual is a great singer with a small band, as in Myron Butler and Levis Nobody Like Our God  Mr. Butler singing with only a drummer, two backup singers and a pianist playing sophisticated harmony. Theres a highly produced, hard-funk, synth-heavy, full-band arrangement of that song on Mr. Butlers forthcoming album, On Purpose. (And there is a live version of it with Mr. Butler singing in front of the International A.M.E. Church Mass Choir that can be seen online.) But here the microphones are dry, the groove is intricate, the tempo is wakeful, and Mr. Butler drives its long crescendo."}
{"text": "William Weld, the vice-presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party, said Wednesday that he believed Hillary Clinton had done nothing criminal in using personal email as secretary of state.Mr. Weld spoke during a wide-ranging interview alongside Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico and the Libertarian Partys presidential nominee. Both secured the Libertarian nomination Sunday at the partys contentious convention in Orlando, Fla., over the weekend.The remarks from Mr. Weld, who served as the governor of Massachusetts as a Republican in the 1990s, are deeply at odds with criticisms from Republicans over Mrs. Clintons tenure at the State Department and the scandal involving her use of a private server for all work emails.His comments could also fuel further skepticism among some Libertarian voters who view Mr. Welds right-of-center years as governor with suspicion. They could also inflame criticism that he is a de facto stalking horse for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for the nomination.Mr. Weld gave a single-word response about whether Mrs. Clinton was a good secretary of state: Yes.He was equally succinct when asked if her use of a private email server, now the subject of an F.B.I. investigation, was a legitimate issue.No, said Mr. Weld, a former prosecutor, adding that he had read of no evidence that would clear the bar for criminality. I think its a nonstarter.He was noncommittal as to whether it showed poor judgment on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, but pointed out that Colin Powell had also used private email while secretary of state under George W. Bush  a point often made by Mrs. Clintons aides.Mr. Weld has been friendly with Mrs. Clinton since they worked together on the impeachment team of the House Judiciary Committee during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. He praised her as kind and smart.He saved his harshest words for Donald J. Trump, the Republican Partys presumptive nominee, whom Mr. Weld has excoriated for anti-immigrant speech.The wall is a joke, Mr. Weld said of Mr. Trumps vow to build a wall along the border with Mexico. But, he added, I would say it was a joke if it didnt remind me so much of the Berlin Wall.He compared Mr. Trump, who has an ardent base of supporters, to Jim Jones, the cult leader whose followers committed suicide by the hundreds, drinking poison at his urging in Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978.Everybody was so fanatically devoted to him that they drank the Kool Aid  and it wasnt particularly good Kool Aid, Mr. Weld said. The analogy there is just the ability to stimulate a fanatical following. And thats fine, but if the fanatical following leads to fanatical behavior, thats not fine.Mr. Weld and Mr. Johnson appeared to be adjusting to their roles as running mates. Mr. Weld, a starchy Northeasterner from a deeply pedigreed family, appeared unaccustomed to playing second fiddle to Mr. Johnson, who is fond of marijuana and embraces being called a fringe candidate. The two men disagreed more than once during the interview.At one point, Mr. Johnson expressed reservations about changing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include protections for gays, lesbians and transgender people. But Mr. Weld quickly said he personally would have no problem with it. And while Mr. Weld praised Mrs. Clintons years in the State Department, Mr. Johnson criticized the foreign policy doctrine of the Obama administration.Both said they were still discerning policy differences with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, although they struggled to come up with deep policy differences with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Weld made clear that he saw the presumptive Republican nominee as a clear and urgent threat.In the case of Mr. Trump, there are questions about whether he would hue to a steady course as president, Mr. Weld said. And it may not be fair to posit that question against the backdrop of the Republican debates, but on the stability question, they were pretty bad.You dont have that question with Mrs. Clinton, he said."}
{"text": "Roger Enrico, the PepsiCo chief executive who nearly dethroned Coca-Cola in the 1980s, died on Wednesday while vacationing in the Cayman Islands. He was 71.His death, on Grand Cayman, was sudden, his family said, and the cause was not immediately specified.Mr. Enrico joined PepsiCo in 1971 after serving in the Navy in the Vietnam War, and he rose swiftly through the ranks. He oversaw the companys advertising campaign during the so-called Cola Wars, making marketing deals with celebrities like Michael Jackson, Madonna and Michael J. Fox. Pepsis market share grew, prompting an anxious Coca-Cola to change its formula in 1985, only to quickly change it back in the face of a tide of customer wrath.We have lost one of the true legends of our company and our industry, Indra K. Nooyi, the chairwoman and chief executive of PepsiCo, said in a statement on Thursday.Born on Nov. 11, 1944, in Chisholm, Minn., Mr. Enrico was the son of a foreman at an iron-ore processing plant. He attended Babson College and then enlisted in the Navy.After returning from the war, he worked as a brand manager in 1971 for Frito-Lay, a PepsiCo subsidiary, where he helped market the onion-flavored crunchy snacks called Funyuns. He later moved to Japan and South America, where he headed PepsiCos regional operations. In 1983, at 38, he became the chief executive of Pepsi-Cola USA and almost immediately signed a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with Michael Jackson.He personally conducted negotiations with Michael Jackson, said Allen Rosenshine, the former chairman and chief executive of BBDO, the advertising company that helped develop PepsiCos marketing campaign during the Cola wars and beyond. The two worked closely with Alan Pottasch, a PepsiCo advertising executive, who is sometimes referred to as the father of the Pepsi Generation.Youre the Pepsi generation, Mr. Jackson sang, and moonwalked with a young Alfonso Ribiero, who would later gain stardom as Carlton Banks on the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.Other celebrities jumped onboard.We made our choice, Lionel Richie crooned while dancing through the streets, flanked by young people. Madonna sipped from a can of Pepsi after singing part of Like a Prayer. (Pepsi canceled the ad after the Like a Prayer music video was condemned by the Vatican for its use of Roman Catholic imagery.)The celebrity-laden, youth-oriented Pepsi Generation advertising blitz was paired with the Pepsi Challenge, which featured people doing a blind taste test of Pepsi and Coke  and usually choosing Pepsi as tastier. Together, the campaigns helped bolster the companys market share.Feeling threatened, Coca-Cola changed its 99-year-old top-secret formula and introduced New Coke, which was supposed to be sweeter than the old version.After 87 years of going at it eyeball to eyeball, the other guy just blinked, Mr. Enrico said in a full-page advertisement in American newspapers on the day that Coca-Cola announced the change. There is no question the long-term market success of Pepsi has forced this move.To celebrate, Pepsi U.S.A. gave its workers a day off.Unhappy Coke drinkers revolted, flooding Coca-Cola with telephone calls, letters and telegrams criticizing the decision to change the formula. The company acted quickly in response, reviving the old formula with Coca-Cola Classic.Mr. Rosenshine credited Mr. Enrico with creating a real distinction between Pepsi and Coke.He probably did more than anyone else to drive Coke to their famous formula change, Mr. Rosenshine said in an interview. You dont generally have a chief executive who is intimately involved with an advertising campaign, but Roger was.Mr. Enrico chronicled PepsiCos battle with Coca-Cola in his 1986 memoir, The Other Guy Blinked  How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars, written with Jesse Kornbluth. (In the end, Pepsi did not win its war with Coke. Coca-Cola regained market share and continues to reign.)In a statement, Muhtar Kent, the chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, called Mr. Enrico an inspirational leader who had challenged us all to compete harder and think bigger.Mr. Enrico was named chief executive and chairman of PepsiCo in 1996. The next year, he spun off the restaurant division, composed of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut chains, as an independent public company, creating what is now known as Yum Brands. In 1998, he oversaw the acquisition of Tropicana and, in 2000, he struck a deal to acquire Quaker Oats, which included Gatorade.Mr. Enrico retired from PepsiCo in 2001 and was later named chairman of DreamWorks Animation, serving from 2004 to 2012.Mr. Enrico retired to Dallas, where Mike Rawlings, a friend, is mayor. The mayor met Mr. Enrico while working at TracyLocke in the 1980s, an advertising firm that worked with PepsiCo. Mr. Rawlings later took the helm of Pizza Hut, which was part of PepsiCo at the time, and continued working with Mr. Enrico.The two men, along with others, had periodically gone on fishing and horseback-riding trips to Montana since the 1990s. Before he died, Mr. Enrico had just invited him on a trip for this summer, Mr. Rawlings said.Aaron Enrico, the executives son, said his father was an avid scuba diver and had been diving in Grand Cayman. His oldest grandson, who had just learned to dive, was there with him on vacation.In addition to his son and grandson, Mr. Enrico is survived by his wife, Rosemary, and two other grandchildren."}
{"text": "LONDON  The concept of worshiping at the altar of fashion took new form on Thursday, as Gucci held its cruise 2017 catwalk show amid the Gothic 13th-century cloisters of Westminster Abbey, one of the most sacred sites in Britain.A 300-strong congregation of industry insiders, starlets and devoted believers gathered just before 3 p.m. on an overcast day for the latest display of kaleidoscopic pageantry from the brands bearded creative designer, Alessandro Michele.I am literally obsessed with everything Alessandro creates, the actress Elle Fanning said from her perch near Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco. There is this constant interplay between old and new that also feels fresh and present and unlike anything else. I want everything, and my friends do, too.They were seated on a front row of forest-green brocade pillows atop gray stone pews, each cushion embroidered with a medieval-style snake or bird, bumble bee or rabbit.Nearby were Georgia May Jagger, Alexa Chung and the singer Will.i.am, as well as several of Mr. Micheles contemporaries, including the London-based designers Christopher Kane and Mary Katrantzou. Salma Hayek marched in wearing oversize glittering black sunglasses, the better to survey her surroundings. It is like a mind-blowing movie scene, she said.Look around you: This is the Alessandro effect, said the Gucci chief executive, Marco Bizzarri, standing on the catwalk his house had built on the centuries-old tombstones of the great and good of England.Over the last 800 years, they may have hosted countless numbers of people making their way into the main church for weddings, funerals and coronations  but never before for a fashion show.This was not the first time a designer juxtaposed the sacred and the profane. Last season, Vetements held its show in the American Cathedral in Paris, and Alexander Wang in St. Bartholomews Church in New York City.But the use of the abbey drew criticism from religious figures such as the Rev. Peter Owen-Jones  an author and the vicar of Firle, Glynde and Beddingham  in the days leading up to the event.Is the central icon of Christianity there to offer spiritual sustenance and love or is it just part of the marketplace of capitalism? he told The Independent, a British newspaper.But the dean of Westminster, head of the chapter of the Abbey, championed the decision, calling it a new and exciting collaboration for us.As Mr. Michele enters his third season at the helm of Gucci, he has certainly generated a near-reverential aura around himself and his aesthetic. His chaotic and colorful collections are noted for a gender-bending, nostalgia-tinged, soft-focus flare, and he has been touted as Guccis commercial savior, reigniting sales after the Italian luxury house spent several seasons in the commercial wilderness. (This is especially important, as Gucci is the flagship brand of the parent group Kering, and accounts for nearly two-thirds of its total profit.)Cruise 2017, a slow procession of approximately 90 models to a mournful chorus of Scarborough Fair sung by the Schola Cantorum of Oxford, was yet another expression of the Michele aesthetic, notionally inspired by what Mr. Michele described as punks, Victoriana and schoolboys, or a promenade through centuries of English history.I love the English aesthetic  in a way I feel like it is close to my own language, a beautiful chaos, he said backstage post-show, calling the country a box of treasures.It is a powerful mix of the past and the present, he said. The English, they love their culture, they celebrate it, in every last detail, and if they go against it, its punk.This particular vision of British eccentricity took shape in pleated 1930s-style tea dresses, rippling in the designers sugar-hit color palette of candy-floss pinks and eye-popping peppermints; lashings of Victoriana and sumptuous metallic brocade gowns with sweeping sleeves made for a modern Guinevere.There were paneled cocktail shifts like stained-glass windows; studded, oversize black leather biker jackets that bled into punky tartan trousers or heritage check skirts; Union Jack sweatshirts and floral deerstalker caps; and (perhaps in homage to Queen Elizabeth II) a rose-printed silk head scarf, military regalia jacket and plaid kilt, teamed with oversize Perspex spectacles.It was a charming and romantic and relentless (and sometimes clashing) mash-up. As for the audience, the reaction can be summed up fairly easily: the rapture, the rapture."}
{"text": "As the battle between Iraqi forces and Islamic State fighters intensified outside the city of Falluja, at least 20,000 children were among the civilians believed to be trapped and coming under fire in the city, the United Nations said on Wednesday.Very few families have been able to leave, the United Nations childrens charity, Unicef said in a news release. According to reports, food and medicine are running out and clean water is in short supply.A visit to the front lines by The New York Times on Sunday showed heavy and continuous shelling of the city by pro-government forces. Shiite militia commanders said the tempo of the fighting might be slowed before any assault on the city itself to allow more civilians to leave. But the commanders acknowledged that relatively few civilians  around 3,700, according to the United Nations  had been able to escape as the fighting intensified over the last week.More than two years ago, Falluja became the first Iraqi city to be captured by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. In the months afterward, the group blitzed across northern and western Iraq, consolidating power in Sunni Arab areas where hostility toward the Shiite national government had long been boiling over.Though it has lost other areas of Anbar Province around Falluja in recent months, the Islamic State has kept a strong hold on the city. Iraqi forces mostly kept it under an effective, but distant, siege, cutting it off from resupply by ISIS. That led to heightened fears about the civilian population and reported shortages of food and medicine in the months before the recent advance on Falluja began.I am desperately worried about what is happening to civilians in Falluja, Lisa Grande, the top United Nations humanitarian official in Iraq, said in an interview this week.Any direct assault on Falluja would most likely carry a high death toll. The Islamic State has had years to fortify the city, including the construction of a huge network of tunnels and traps that have been a focus of American airstrikes in recent days. Long before that, the city had been a stronghold of Sunni extremism. And it was the center of particularly deadly battles  for American forces and Iraqi civilians  during fighting to take the city in 2004.In its announcement on Wednesday, Unicef expressed concern that children under Islamic State rule were at risk of being forced to fight for the militants.Children who are recruited see their lives and futures jeopardized as they are forced to carry and use arms, fighting in an adult war, the agency said."}
{"text": "The Fits, a dreamy, beautifully syncopated coming-of-age tale, takes place in and around a recreational center that could not look less inviting. Its the usual impersonal slab, the kind that municipalities have been building for decades to educate, or sometimes just to warehouse, restless young bodies and minds. The girls who congregate at this particular center in Cincinnati, though, have their own desires, which they express with fists and feet, grace and power. They move  fluidly, ferociously and with escalating mystery  to their own transporting beat.The same holds true of The Fits, a singular first feature from the young director Anna Rose Holmer, whos made a movie that can feel like a memory. The story  Ms. Holmer wrote the script with one of the movies producers, Lisa Kjerulff, and its editor, Saela Davis  is elemental, elliptical and radiates out from its sun, the 11-year-old Toni (the wonderful Royalty Hightower). One of those quiet, watchful girls (either naturally shy or tactically stoic), Toni all but lives at the recreational center, specifically the boxing club where she works out with her older brother, Jermaine (DaSean Minor), throwing punches and counting situps as she gasps for her next breath.Tonis boxing routine derails after she peers through a center window one day and discovers a new world  a dance team called the Lionesses. Theyre a gorgeously variegated group, these girls, who come in all sizes, shapes, hues, hairstyles and degrees of coordination. Some fill the room with vertiginous movement, with spinning limbs and whipping hair that turn their practice room into an Abstract Expressionist canvas of slashing, swooping lines. Other girls just get tangled up and collapse like pickup sticks (all flailing, all flopping). Yet even these fumblers keep chasing the group beat, waving their arms while together everyone pumps their hips.Curious, Toni joins the Lionesses (whats the worst that can happen?, her brother shrugs); it isnt a fast fit. Trained in the boxing club, she jabs more easily than she turns, but shes strong; another new recruit, Beezy (Alexis Neblett, a charmer), calls her Guns, a nod to her muscled arms. But Toni keeps at it, awkwardly miming the moves of the older girls while studying their rites, as when she observes two beauties primping before a mirror. In time, she also picks up their language: She pierces her ears, wears nail polish and flashes a smile. The drill that the Lionesses practice is part joyous self-expression, part ritualistic bluff, which makes it a perfect manifestation of adolescence.Ms. Holmer leads with atmosphere and space (including that landscape called the human face), and tends to let the sumptuously textured visuals and intermittent blasts of percussive music express what the characters dont. (The cinematographer is Paul Yee, another talented newcomer.) Just at the point when the movie seems to be settling into familiar indie-film narrative drift, the older girls begin having inexplicable seizures, fits. One after another, they violently succumb, bodies shuddering and falling in front of their mesmerized team members. The girls are horrified by these spells, but theyre also fascinated maybe especially because the victims soon recover.An outsider is called in to investigate the attacks, and theres talk of contaminated water. The inquiry adds a hint of drama to the minimalist plot, but is finally irrelevant to the seizures, their enveloping mysteriousness and profound impact on Toni. Are these Freudian fits, Crucible-like convulsions, orgiastic reveries, initiation ceremonies (into femininity, etc.) or sly performances from attention-hungry adolescents? If the filmmakers never directly say, its because they dont have to. Gender is some kind of performance (hysterical, hysterically absurd). And anyway Toni figures it out. This is, after all, her story, as the expressionistic cinematography underscores.As Toni shifts between the boxing club (she helps her brother clean up) and the dance team, The Fits seems to be inching into perilously schematic ground. Theres something altogether too neat-sounding about a story in which a prepubescent girl overtly coded as a tomboy travels back and forth  with inquisitiveness and periodic unease  between these distinctly gendered spaces. The miracle of the movie is that, like Toni, it transcends blunt, reductive categorization partly because its free of political sloganeering, finger wagging and force-fed lessons. Any uplift that you may feel wont come from having your ideas affirmed, but from something ineluctable  call it art.The Fits is not rated, i.e. suitable for all ages.

{"text": "DUBLIN, Ohio  The N.B.A. finals is billed as the Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James versus the Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry. Yet when these teams met for the title last year, the Warriors Andre Iguodala emerged as the Most Valuable Player. It is what makes sports so compelling: The result is what happens after everyone has written the ending.This weeks Memorial Tournament, a two-hour drive from King Jamess commonwealth, opened Thursday and featured the top three golfers in the world: Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy. Each is coming off a victory: Day at the Players, McIlroy at the Irish Open and Spieth at the P.G.A. Tour stop in Fort Worth, lending credence to their designation as the modern incarnation of the Big Three  Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.Day, who lives nearby and is a member at Muirfield Village, carded a six-under-par 66 and is two strokes off the lead, but neither McIlroy nor Spieth was ahead of him. They were nowhere to be found on the first page of the leader board, a reminder that talent on the tour is much more than three-deep.The first-round pacesetter was Dustin Johnson, who shot an eight-under 64 at Muirfield Village. Johnson looked like a worldbeater last June when he hit two of the prettiest shots ever seen under pressure on the 72nd hole of the United States Open to give himself one putt for the victory and two to tie Spieth. He missed both: a 12-footer for eagle and a 4-footer for birdie. If not for his first miss on a green that had a five oclock shadow, Johnson, 31, would currently have as many major titles as Spieth, the world No. 2, and Day, the world No. 1, and would be three behind the third-ranked McIlroy.I think that Dustin Johnson is arguably the most talented player on the P.G.A. Tour, said Spieth, who opened with a 70. He described Johnson, who has at least one tour victory in each of the past eight seasons and nine over all, as a freakish athlete and golfer.He has great hands, great club face control, Spieth said. I mean, he hits some shots where you wont see anyone else trying to.Spieth said its a matter of time before Johnson wins a major and suggested that the one stroke that separated them at the United States Open had little to do with skill. That specific putt, he said, referring to Johnsons eagle attempt, was almost luck-based with the speed that it had to roll at and the kind of break that it took. But I still expected it to go in.Johnson, who averaged 309 yards off the tee on Thursday, had 11 one-putts. Though famous for his driving, Johnsons success hinges on his precision on the greens. Still got to make the putts, he said. It doesnt matter how good you hit it.Johnson added: Every part of my game I feel like is getting better. Just have to be more consistent with putting.Asked if his struggles on the green are more technical or mental, Johnson said: Thats a good question. I dont know. If I did, I think Id probably putt a little better.In lieu of answers, Johnson has settled on a solution. Hit it closer, he said, referring to his approach shots.The prince of putting is Spieth, who played with two long hitters, McIlroy and the one-time tour winner Justin Thomas, in a grouping that fell a few bulbs short of a marquee. McIlroy carded a 71, six strokes better than Thomas, who was five-over after three holes. Starting on Muirfield Villages back nine, Spieth one-putted the first seven greens. Four of the putts he sank in that span were over 11 feet. Spieths ability to use his putter like an eraser to eradicate his mistakes can be demoralizing to his playing competitors.Its impressive, said McIlroy, who outplayed him tee to green, only to make the turn two strokes behind him.McIlroys length off the tee can be intimidating to opponents, who mess with their rhythm trying to eke out a few more yards on their drives. But Spieths accuracy with his putter is no less fearsome.A shot is a shot, whether its a putt or a drive, McIlroy said. Theyre all important. We get it done different ways, but we get it done.Nicklaus, this weeks tournament host, said more players are finding a way to get it done than in his era. I think the tour is probably as healthy as its ever been, he said, adding: I think we have more good players today than weve ever had in the game of golf. And I think thats saying a lot because we had a lot of good players when I played.One of the golfers who has flirted with greatness is Patrick Reed, a four-time tour winner with eight top-10 finishes in 16 starts this season. Reed, who opened with a 68, craves more than consistency. Nearly 18 months have passed since his last victory, at the 2015 Tournament of Champions. With so much talent on the tour, the margins of error have grown as small as the periods in tournament checks. Reed, 25, tried to fine-tune his game to keep pace with his peers and ended up becoming a mechanical mess.I was trying to be too perfect in my golf swing and trying to be too perfect at every aspect of the game, Reed said. With that, I was getting away from going out and shooting a score.Ninety-seven players made more than $1 million in prize money in 2014-15. Led by Day, Spieth and McIlroy, the top players appear in no danger of becoming complacent. Rickie Fowler, the world No. 5, made a beeline for the range to work out the kinks in his swing after signing for his round of 75.One of Spieths favorite athletes is Curry, the N.B.A.s regular-season M.V.P. I most appreciate that not only did he not settle last year, he did everything he could to improve as a player, to better himself and his team, Spieth said, adding, I can learn from that, certainly, that he seems to be even having more fun by working even harder and climbing more mountains, reaching the top of the next peak and then seeing another one and challenging himself to get there."}
{"text": "The Cincinnati police have handed over to a prosecutor the results of their investigation into the actions of the family of a boy whose foray into an enclosure at the citys zoo led to the killing of an endangered gorilla, officials said on Thursday.The Hamilton County prosecuting attorney said in a statement that the office would review the case and make a determination about whether to file charges as early as Friday.No decision has been made at this point, Tiffaney Hardy, a police spokeswoman, said on Thursday.Also on Thursday, the police released an audio tape of the 911 call placed by the 3-year-old boys mother on Saturday after he crawled into the Gorilla World exhibit and ended up in the arms of Harambe, a male silverback gorilla weighing around 420 pounds.The womans frantic conversation with an emergency dispatcher brings to light the panic that gripped onlookers as Harambe hovered over the child, at times dragging him by the ankle, for about 10 minutes until zoo workers fatally shot the animal.My son fell in the zoo exhibit! the mother, whose name has not been released, says on the call. My son fell in with the gorilla!Theres a male gorilla standing over him. I need someone to contact the zoo, please, she says.We do already have help started there, O.K., the operator tells her.The mother then calls out to the boy, Be calm, be calm, she says. Hes dragging my son. I cant watch this. I cant. I cant.The killing of the majestic, 17-year-old ape drew widespread outrage online, directed in part at the zoo over the integrity of its barrier as well as its decision to use live rounds instead of a tranquilizer dart.The zoos director, Thane Maynard, has defended the integrity of the enclosures barrier, saying that they passed regular checks by an accrediting agency. On Thursday, however, the zoo said that it had modified the barrier, raising it to 42 inches with wooden beams and knotted rope netting. It said the exhibit would reopen on June 7.Our exhibit goes above and beyond standard safety requirements, Mr. Maynard said in a statement, but in light of what happened, we have modified the outer public barrier to make entry even more difficult.Mr. Maynard has also stood by the decision to kill Harambe, saying that a tranquilizer would have taken several precious minutes to knock out the animal. The impact of a dart, he added, could have startled the gorilla, with possibly deadly consequences.The boys mother, who has declined to be interviewed, has faced the brunt of the public anger. By Thursday morning, an online petition calling for her to be investigated for negligence had drawn more than 470,000 signatures."}
{"text": "BALTIMORE  FIVE years ago this month, the Food and Drug Administration released some striking images of the damage that smoking can do. These stark and disturbing pictures dominated the news cycle, as millions of Americans got a glimpse of the unvarnished truth.In one, healthy lungs were juxtaposed with blackened and diseased ones that had been poisoned by tobacco. Another photo zoomed in on a human mouth, the teeth stained and rotted, and the lower lip abscessed. Yet another showed a woman wailing in pain from the deadly effects of secondhand smoking.The F.D.A.s message to the public was that tobacco companies would soon be required to include such images on every pack of cigarettes. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services at the time, welcomed the move.These labels are frank, honest and powerful depictions of the health risks of smoking, she noted, and they will help encourage smokers to quit, and prevent children from smoking.Big Tobaccos response? Within months, an industry group sued the F.D.A., its then commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, and Ms. Sebelius herself on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the requirements to display these warnings on tobacco products were unconstitutional and would make them a mouthpiece for the Governments emotionally charged anti-smoking message.The industry won an injunction when the presiding judge agreed that the images were calculated to provoke rather than disseminate purely factual and uncontroversial information. The courts ruling  inform, but do not inflame  sent the federal health authorities back to the drawing board.The same industry that brought the world the infamous Marlboro cowboy and Joe Camel was now fighting corrective images designed to direct consumers away from cigarettes, a product that kills half of its long-term users. The success of the industrys lawsuit means that five years after the labels were announced with such fanfare, and seven years after the law that mandated them was passed, America is still waiting.How many deaths could have been prevented if the tobacco companies had not succeeded in staying the F.D.A.s hand?New research estimates that at least 3,000 deaths attributable to smoking in the United States could be averted in the first five years when the new labeling goes into effect. But the Food and Drug Administration already has a wealth of evidence to justify its implementation of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the 2009 law that requires the agency to deliver the new labels. And no court ruling has removed the F.D.A.s obligation to devise such warnings.One recent study found that labels with graphic images worked better than ones with text warnings only, by giving people a more memorable and negative view of smoking. Another study of young people between the ages of 18 and 30 found that the labels made them more fearful of the health effects of smoking and more wary about taking up the habit. Research conducted around the F.D.A.s announcement found that graphic labels improved peoples recall of the warning and health risks of smoking.As a recent voting member of the F.D.A.s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, I reached out to Mitch Zeller, the director of the agencys Center for Tobacco Products, to ask why the new labeling still hadnt seen the light of day. Mr. Zeller told me that the center was doing research to develop new warning labels that conformed with the 2009 law. This kind of research can take time, he said, and it is important to accumulate the best evidence for the proposed warnings. Mr. Zeller could not provide specifics on a timeline for implementation.It was less than a decade ago that American tobacco companies were found liable for covering up the health risks from smoking. The delay over labeling has once again made the United States an outlier in the global effort to address this pressing public health need. Nearly 80 countries around the world  from Bangladesh and Canada to Egypt and Pakistan  have embraced graphic labels and the resounding research behind them. Some, like Australia and Britain, have gone further still and forced companies to remove their branding, and display only stark images on their packaging.In the United States, though, the tobacco companies are still winning, while the people who continue to smoke are losing out. As are the children who will take up smoking. And as are those among us who will lose a parent, a sibling or a child to tobacco-caused disease. More than 50 years after the surgeon generals report on Smoking and Health laid bare the dangers of smoking, America is still beholden to Big Tobacco.This industry has bullied us enough. The Food and Drug Administration has deferred action for too long, and must meet the tobacco companies with the same vigor, audacity and urgency that the industry has employed so effectively for decades. The F.D.A. must uphold its mandate and deliver the kind of public health service that the law requires and that America deserves."}
{"text": "Among the most revered works by the great British painter Joseph Mallord William Turner (17751851) are those representing the world dissolved by light, steam, fog, smoke, rain, wind and snow. One of his favorite settings for his evocations of elemental chaos was the ocean, a place where nature regularly overwhelms human challenges to its dominion.In this vein, late in his career, when he was around 70, Turner made the dangerous business of whaling the subject of four paintings. He exhibited two of them at the Royal Academy in London in 1845 and the others in 1846, but theyve never been shown all together until now, as the Metropolitan Museum of Art has united them in Turners Whaling Pictures, an exceptionally thought-provoking exhibition.The shows centerpiece is Whalers (circa 1845), which the Met owns. The massive dark head of a wounded sperm whale erupts above the mossy-green sea surface to the left, bloody water streaming over its back. Its tail is visible in glimpses amid the froth to the right, while in the middle, an oarsman struggles to keep afloat his small boat, from which his mates have been tossed into the brine. In the background, rendered in pale grays, the three-masted whaling vessel, with all sails raised, looms like a ghost ship against a white sky.This description makes the picture seem clearer than it is. Made in a proto-Impressionist manner, with paint applied in flurries of marks and in sweeping gestures, it projects a blurry scene, more dreamlike than conventionally realistic. If youre interested in detailed pictorial documentation of the whaling industry, this is not the most informative of sources.The other three paintings, all owned by the Tate, London, are similarly indistinct and lushly atmospheric while depicting events of terrific excitement. In the second painting from 1845, also titled Whalers, harpooners stand on the bows of two boats, aiming their weapons at the dark hump of a surfacing whale spouting a bloody geyser. Hurrah! For the Whaler Erebus! Another Fish! (1846) depicts through a thick, glowing haze the aftermath of a successful hunt, with men in boats to the left celebrating, and others, on the ship to the right, taking apart their catch.Whalers (Boiling Blubber) Entangled in Flaw Ice, Endeavoring to Extricate Themselves (1846) represents two spectral ships on an eerily calm Arctic sea. The one to the right has an orange ember smoldering at its center, representing fire heating a caldron of whale fat. Farther to the right, you can make out men sawing a big chunk of the ice that threatens to entrap their vessel.Were it not for the explanatory museum labels, a viewer today would have a hard time making out whats going on in either of the two later works. Observers in Turners day regularly remarked on his painterly obfuscations. Writing about one of the whaling pictures, a critic noted, There is a charming association of colour here  the emerald green tells with exceeding freshness; but it would be impossible to define anything in the composition save the rigging of the ship. The reference to color may puzzle todays viewers. Turner often used fugitive pigments that eventually lost their vibrancy. His whaling pictures probably used to be more colorful than they are now.Turner himself never went on a whaling voyage, and its possible that he never saw a whale, alive or dead. Few people had, which is why the subject piqued imaginations. The exhibitions organizer, Alison Hokanson, an assistant curator at the Met, writes in an excellent essay published in a museum bulletin, The open ocean in Turners day was akin to deep space today: a vast and mostly uncharted realm that was often the stuff of fantasy. Elsewhere, she notes: Whales, and particularly sperm whales, were quasi-mythological creatures. Most people had never seen one of the animals, and existing images and descriptions, even scientific ones, were generally inaccurate.Figuratively speaking, the whale Turner was trying to capture was the Sublime, a topic on the minds of the philosophers, artists and poets of his day. The Sublime was whatever exceeded human comprehension by virtue of its vastness and dynamism. In those Post-Enlightenment times, you could doubt the existence of God, but the Sublime was undeniably manifest, if not fully comprehensible, in mountains, volcanoes, typhoons, the ocean and giant creatures of the deep. Turners incandescent pictures teeter on the brink of the unknowable, at the outer limits of imagination, where the real vaporizes into the infinite.Scholars are uncertain whether Herman Melville ever saw Turners whaling pictures, but he knew about them. He wrote, Turners pictures of whalers were suggested by this book in a copy of The Natural History of the Sperm Whale, a study by Thomas Beale that Turner did, in fact, consult. Unlike Turners paintings, Melvilles Moby-Dick; or, the Whale is filled with enough detail to serve as a textbook on the whaling industry.But the novelist and the painter were kindred spirits in their pursuits of the awesome and the terrifying. The exhibitions introductory wall text quotes a passage from the third chapter of Moby-Dick, in which Ishmael describes a large, old, much abused painting of a whale attacking a ship that he came upon at the Spouter-Inn: A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant.It would be wonderful to think of Turner reading Moby-Dick and recognizing his own work in Ishmaels heated description, but its almost certain that he didnt. He died in December 1851, just two months after the publication of Melvilles epic tragedy."}
{"text": "What in the World offers you glimpses of what our journalists are observing around the globe. Let us know what you think: whatintheworld@nytimes.comPlop down in almost any West African capital, and settle in for a fashion show.Along the sandy streets that double as a catwalk, youll spot men in flowing boubous, a loose-fitting tunic that reaches to the floor. Some styles are so elaborate that they approach the poufy, shiny tufts of 1950s American prom dresses.But the real standouts are the women, with their colorful skirts and dresses made from wax print fabric, or more likely a digitally reproduced knockoff called fancy fabric. Stars, swirls, flowers and paisleys adorn the printed cotton material wrapped around their torsos and heads.For the women, the designs can be very personal. Some are worn for special occasions, and others commemorate major events. Some have images of roller skates, drums or tubes of lipstick celebrating pop culture, or laptops in honor of computer literacy. A popular style includes images of a bag once carried by Michelle Obama.One pattern called The Family shows a hen surrounded by eggs and chicks, alongside rooster heads. The most common interpretation for this pattern isnt particularly flattering to the father figure: A woman may be married, but shes the center of the home. Another pattern shows birds soaring from cages and is called You Fly, I Fly. Its message: If a man cheats on a woman, a woman will do the same.Religious sayings and images also appear on the cloth. Baby Jesus is popular in market stalls that sell religious fabric. A Savior is Born is the caption above an image of Jesus in a manger, with Mary and Joseph hovering. Another says Mother Mary Full of Grace across the blue-dotted cloth. Other popular images include the popes face atop the Vatican, and St. Bernadette and St. Christopher, with the line Pray for us.Outsiders may be surprised to see such Christian imagery in a country like Senegal, where more than 90 percent of the population is Muslim. Wearing the religious cloth is a bold expression of faith.During election campaigns, the faces of leading politicians show up on the fabric. In Yaound, Cameroon, President Paul Biyas face is printed on womens dresses. Candidates hand out the fabric freely, the way American candidates might give away campaign buttons and T-shirts, according to Nina Sylvanus, an anthropology professor at Northeastern University who has studied the fabric and its connotations.But in West Africa, wearing the fabric doesnt necessarily signify support. Some women strategically tailor their political prints so a candidates face is across their derrire."}
{"text": "Versace is not just getting a new chief executive, it is getting a reality check.Donatella Versace and Bruce Weber are together again  almost 20 years after their last project  and the combination has produced some unexpected results in the form of a fall ad campaign for Versaces womens styles.There are supermodels, sure (Karlie Kloss, Gigi Hadid); the money shot of handbags; and the whole campaign reflects the marketing trend toward community creation (see the eight models in Givenchys fall grouping, and the 11 in Guccis spring effort). But the photographs, which will be in magazines this summer, were shot in Chicago, and include nonmodels from the city in an effort to move from fashion fantasy to actuality, or at least the Versace version of it. It might be a bit hard to tell  people may legitimately cringe at the idea of a glossy European fashion brands manicured idea of grit and art being used to sell clothes, and may question the depth of its engagement  but it is also perhaps a moment of recognition.We called Ms. Versace and Mr. Weber to find out the back story: How the campaign happened, and why.BW: We are like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor: get together, split up, get back together again.DV: For me, this was kind of a turning point. Versaces image is so much about the red carpet. But I wanted to make day clothes fierce. You know: Shes a superstar, and she runs her business, and she runs her family too. Fashion is a part of life, and I thought it was important to show it could be a part of many different lives. That it could help you in your life. Its not about creating beautiful illusions anymore.BW: Donatella was really into the idea of taking the men and women she designs for and putting them in the world where you work, you go out with your family, you live. Its always funny to me that people think fashion photography is all about showing the clothes. Its not. Its about reporting.DV: Bruce decided we should shoot in Chicago. I didnt know it at all. But the city is so multilayered. Then he said we could be in the studio, but we had to go to the supermarket too, because really powerful women also go to the supermarket.BW: Donatella went to the supermarket. I have the picture to prove it.I had read a story in The New Yorker about a pastor called Father Mike, who is pretty controversial, and it caught my imagination. I went to hear him speak before we started shooting, and he was talking about politics and the need to restore old neighborhoods, and it made me think I wanted these pictures to mean something to the city. But it required a lot of trust, because I shoot on film instead of digital, so Donatella could not see what we were doing as we were doing it.DV: We started with three women  models  and a few male models, and then we added a lot more men we just found in the city. In the end, there were 26 men and 17 were not models. There was one opera singer, some dancers  And then Bruce put together all kinds of very diverse families in the pictures.BW: I was thinking about how Pasolini made films in Italy, and he would go to these towns and the next thing you know the chef is the star of the film. We found one guy who had been a bodyguard, and he had been stationed in Afghanistan. We met a group of hip-hop dancers on the street and their manager was there, so we just said, Hey, you want to be in a Versace campaign? They said, Are you serious? It was so nice to see them walk out at the end with these amazing suits Donatella had given them, these great shoes.DV: The clothes werent the payment, they were a present. We paid them, too. For the next mens show we are going to bring a lot of them to Milan. They were important because they speak a different language from me  literally, but also generationally, And fashion needs that. Otherwise we will all be left behind. I think."}
{"text": "BERLIN  The German Parliament overwhelmingly adopted a symbolic but fraught resolution on Thursday declaring the killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 a genocide, escalating tensions with Turkey at a diplomatically delicate juncture.The Turkish government angrily denounced the vote as null and void, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called his ambassador in Germany back to Ankara for consultations.The way to close the dark pages of your own history is not by defaming the histories of other countries with irresponsible and baseless decisions, Turkeys foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, wrote on Twitter. In Ankara, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said, There is no shameful incident in our past that would make us bow our heads.Germany needs Turkeys help in following through on a deal with the European Union to manage the refugee crisis attributed in large part to the Syrian civil war. At the same time, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has been under pressure not to be seen as caving to pressure from Ankara to compromise on Western values, particularly after a recent dust-up over freedom of speech set off by a German comedians satire that outraged Mr. Erdogan.For Turkey, there is scarcely a more delicate topic than what historians say was the murder of more than a million Armenians and other Christian minorities in 1915-16. In April, Mr. Erdogan visited the Armenian Patriarchate of Turkey and, in a carefully worded statement, extended condolences to the families of those who had died, but the Turkish government has long rejected the term genocide.Ankara has noted that thousands of people, many of them Turks, died in the civil war that destroyed the Ottoman Empire, and argued that the estimates of the number of Armenian deaths have been exaggerated.The issue is also fraught for Germany. At the time of the killings, Germany, led by Kaiser Wilhelm II, was allied with the Ottomans, fighting alongside the Austro-Hungarian Empire against Britain, France and Russia in World War I. Acceptance of German responsibility for the atrocities of World War II has become an established part of the nations culture, and historians and activists have said that the Armenian resolution was an important step in acknowledging Germanys indirect involvement in the 1915 killings.Pope Francis called the killings a genocide last year, but the United States has long skirted the issue. President Obama stopped short of using the word  most recently in a statement marking Armenian Remembrance Day on April 24  though he used the term before becoming president.Ms. Merkels Christian Democratic Union and its coalition partners supported the resolution, which was originally proposed for last year, to mark the centennial of the start of the killings. But it was repeatedly delayed, most recently in February, over concerns about angering Ankara.As the vote approached, debate intensified in Germany, which is home to an estimated three million people of Turkish descent, many of whom have dual citizenship. About 2,000 Turks demonstrated last weekend in Berlin, rallying to say that Parliament is not a court and therefore should not pass judgment.Ms. Merkel was in a tough spot. When she visited Istanbul last week, she spent time with Turkish intellectuals and lawyers critical of Mr. Erdogan before meeting the president, who warned her not to move forward with the resolution.Her decision to do so, despite those objections, may have been influenced by an episode in March, when a German comic, Jan Bhmermann, lampooned Mr. Erdogan with a crude poem. Ms. Merkel initially criticized the verses, giving the impression  which she later said was a mistake  that she advocated restrictions on freedom of expression in Germany. Critics portrayed her as weak.Cem Ozdemir, the co-chairman of the opposition Greens and a driving force behind the resolution, accused Ms. Merkel of paying little heed to Turkey for most of her decade in power, until circumstances forced her to engage with Mr. Erdogan.On Thursday, Mr. Ozdemir said there was never a favorable time to speak about something as dreadful as genocide.Mr. Ozdemir read century-old statements by officials of the German Empire showing they knew that up to 90 percent of Armenians had been killed. Working through the Shoah is the basis of democracy in Germany, Mr. Ozdemir said, referring to the Holocaust. This genocide is also waiting to be worked through.He noted that there were Turks who had saved Armenians. Before them, we bow down with highest respect, he said.Mr. Ozdemir said he had received threats because of his support for the vote, but that it was even more dangerous for people in Turkey to acknowledge the genocide.The vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament, was nearly unanimous, with one lawmaker voting against and another abstaining. (Ms. Merkel and the two most senior Social Democrat ministers  Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier  were not present.)Norbert Lammert, the president of the Bundestag, kicked off the debate with a clear message. Parliament is not a historians commission, and certainly not a court, he said. He added that the current Turkish government is not responsible for what happened 100 years ago, but it does have responsibility for what becomes of this in present times.Mr. Lammert, a Christian Democrat, labeled the Ottomans killing of Armenians as genocide last year. Particularly because of our own chapters of dark history, Germans know that only by working through past events can one achieve reconciliation and cooperation, Mr. Lammert said on Thursday.Including Germany, 12 of the European Unions 28 members have recognized the Armenian killings as genocide. Despite initial protests, Turkey has maintained good relations with several of those countries.When France approved legislation in 2011 recognizing the genocide, Turkey temporarily recalled its ambassador and halted bilateral military cooperation. Such steps by Ankara would be more complicated today and potentially more damaging, as Germany and Turkey are engaged in a NATO operation to stop migrant boats crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece.Aydan Ozoguz, the German commissioner for integration, who  like Mr. Ozdemir  is of Turkish descent, said before the vote that while she intended to vote for the resolution, I still think it is the wrong path. She added that she thought it would backfire.Mr. Erdogan and ultranationalist Turks will get a huge boost, Ms. Ozoguz said. They will use the resolution as proof of a further attack by the West on Turkey. Reasonable, considered voices will be isolated and will have no chance to be heard for a long time."}

{"text": "Death is thick in the air Sunday night on Nat Geo Wild, and the carnage cant come soon enough for me. Ive seen about all the cute videos of dogs playing with ocelots that I can stand.You may not have noticed, but a certain warm fuzziness has infested the world of nature videos, whether homemade or broadcast quality. YouTube is full of unusual animal pairings  a lioness that apparently adopted an antelope calf; a kitten snuggling with a young deer; a tiger hanging out with a bear in a zoo. Nature-oriented TV channels regularly serve up similar stuff, Nat Geo Wild itself being a principal offender with its Unlikely Animal Friends.Enough already. Earlier this year, the hit movie Zootopia gave us an animated paradise in which animals of all sorts lived together peacefully, but when did the society in that story become threatened? When it forgot that although greed and ruthlessness and self-interest might be sublimated, they never disappear.Thats why Im glad to see Nat Geo making amends Sunday with three brutal hours of animals hunting down and eating other animals. The three-part special makes its intent clear from the title, Africas Deadliest, and in case you missed the point each hour has a subtitle: Invaders, Assassins, Ambush Hunters. And the narrative leaves nothing to the imagination.Four thousand pounds of bite force shear the full-grown seal in half, were told as a shark makes a kill.Commenters who have watched the various odd-animal-pair videos are fond of suggesting that humans could learn something about cooperation from watching a monkey groom a cat, but Africas Deadliest also has plenty to teach us, and its far more relevant to surviving in an imperfect world.For instance, watching this carnivorous orgy, you quickly realize that you always need to be on guard against doing anything that would get you labeled a straggler. The moment an animal, whether on land or in the water, wanders off from its herd or school or flock or whatever, the narrator calls it the S word and it becomes a victim  just as in the cutthroat human world. Lets see, who can I buttonhole and force to look at the 300 vacation photos I shot with my iPhone? How about Genzlinger? Hes straggling.The other thing you learn from these shows is, you do not want to be a wildebeest. There is footage here of all sorts of animals eating or trying to eat other animals  orca-penguin, cheetah-gazelle, tiger shark-turtle, leopard-monkey, secretary bird-cobra. Most animals are given only one appearance, but, incredibly, wildebeests turn up as targets or would-be targets in all three segments. In Hour 1, hyenas try for a wildebeest dinner. In Hour 2, first a leopard, then a crocodile do the same. In Hour 3, its a lioness.Geesh, these wildebeests must be thinking, if wildebeests think. What the heck? Did somebody stick an Eat Me sign on by backside?Anyway, its worth remembering that wild animals  even ones in zoos, as last weekends gorilla incident in Cincinnati sadly made clear  are not necessarily interested in cuddling up with your pet rabbit. If the somewhat irritating narration in the Nat Geo programs is too off-putting, BBC America offers a more highbrow version of the same message next month with The Hunt, a seven-parter narrated by the naturalist David Attenborough. Among the first casualties in Part 1: a wildebeest."}
{"text": "FREMANTLE, Australia  For Scott Miller, part of a team searching for the remains of a doomed Malaysia Airlines flight, the worst hours in a lifetime at sea came when his 215-foot vessel was caught last year between two powerful tropical cyclones and lashed by hurricane-force winds.The largest wave was like an eight-story building coming at the boat, said Mr. Miller, the chief ocean floor surveyor aboard the ship, the Fugro Equator. It was quite scary, the waves were the biggest Ive ever seen.For Micah Hunter, the supervisor of the sofa-size sonar equipment towed behind the vessel, the most difficult moments were when a tow cable began fraying as the so-called towfish was being hauled up from near the ocean floor in late April.Two of the cables steel strands suddenly snapped, with one of them driving all the way through his left pinkie and out the other side, despite a protective glove. The other strand penetrated deep into his left index finger.And for Rhiannon Woolhouse-Williams, an ocean floor surveyor who is the only woman in the 30-member crew and also the youngest at 23, the hardest part has been living at sea far from her home and friends in New Zealand.For more than two years, crews aboard the Fugro Equator and other vessels have been searching the southern Indian Ocean for the remains of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.Month after month, the crews braved mountainous seas and loneliness to answer a mystery that has confounded the globe, with little to show for their efforts.Ms. Woolhouse-Williams joined Fugro, a Dutch company managing the search on a contract from the Australian government, right after her graduation from college in late 2014. She soon began a long series of six-week voyages to some of the most remote waters ever searched.Before I went there, I couldnt understand how isolated you were, she said in an interview on the back deck of the Equator after it arrived in Fremantle, the port that serves Perth, Australia, to pick up supplies in early May. We didnt see any other vessels for weeks.The Fugro Equator has repeatedly found fields of debris on the deep ocean floor, 12,000 to 15,000 feet below the waves. Each time, spirits have soared as the crew members hoped that they had found the missing plane.The first time they found a debris field, they were so excited that Fugro even notified the office of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, who was traveling in Europe, to be ready to make an announcement.Each time, the Equator or one of the other vessels has sent down an unmanned, remotely operated device to examine the wreckage with very high-resolution sonar and sometimes with cameras as well. But every time, the debris has turned out to be from previously unknown shipwrecks.The shipwrecks seldom look the same, and the most recent one looked so much like a plane on images from the towed sonar device that it initially fooled Mr. Miller. As it scuttled past on the screen, I called up everyone in Fugro, he said. When we went past that one, I was certain wed found MH370.But it proved to be a steel vessel that had landed more upright on the ocean floor and with less damage than others they had located.For Capt. Andreas Ryanto Molyo, the commander of the Fugro Equator, the worst moment came during the same confluence of storms that alarmed Mr. Miller. Powerful gusts started forcing rain into the ships ventilation system through a vent on the back of the vessel, threatening to cripple the engines and electrical systems.Engineers opened a joint in the ventilation tubing and drained the water. The crew was lucky that the weather was cool and the intake fan in the ventilation system was not running, so it did not short-circuit, Captain Molyo said.The waves were so steep and violent that crew members who wanted to sleep tried an old sailor trick of tucking life vests under the sides of their mattresses to avoid being tossed out.But as the ocean became even more tumultuous, Ms. Woolhouse-Williams found that even that was not enough, and she tried to stay in her bunk with one leg braced against the wall and the opposite hand against the meager, bolted-down furniture.You kind of sleep propped against the wee bedside table, she said. Fugro has dispensed more than 300 prescriptions for seasickness to crew members, who said that few had been immune.The sonar equipment was hauled up from near the ocean floor  a six-hour process  and safely lashed down before the cyclones hit, but there was not enough time to flee the area entirely.Fugro has changed its procedures since then and now provides color maps to the crew of incoming storms instead of numerical weather information, said Steve Duffield, the managing director of Fugros ocean survey operations in Australia. It is also quicker to interrupt the search if a tropical cyclone threatens, he said.Crew members said that they were not ready to end the search for Flight 370. They still hope to locate the aircraft on the seafloor and its black boxes, with the goal of unlocking the mystery of why the plane went astray.Everyone is still really invested in finding it, and no one has given up yet on finding it, Ms. Woolhouse-Williams said. It would be hard to be out here if you didnt believe."}
{"text": "As part of their continuing war on fetal tissue research, House Republicans are now accusing a tissue procurement company and three abortion clinics of violating federal privacy law.In a letter dated Wednesday, Representative Marsha Blackburn, chair of the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, charged that StemExpress and the clinics, two of which are Planned Parenthood affiliates, violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by sharing information on patients receiving abortions. A separate letter accuses StemExpress of using improper consent forms, among other infractions. The letters ask officials at the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate whether the company and the clinics broke the law.StemExpress has vigorously denied the allegations. StemExpress is confident there has been no violation of law and appropriate consents were made for every fetal tissue donation, the company said in a statement.We welcome the opportunity to answer any questions from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or any other agency related to Ms. Blackburns continued unfounded accusations.These accusations are the latest step in an investigation that has never had any reason to exist. The House panel was formed after the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, released deceptively edited videos purporting to reveal that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue for profit. Since then, repeated investigations have found no evidence that Planned Parenthood did anything wrong, and members of the Center for Medical Progress have been indicted for their activities.If Republicans on the panel were truly concerned about HIPAA compliance in fetal tissue research, they could have accepted StemExpresss offer to testify. But they appear more interested in attempting to discredit the company and the clinics with which it works. Ms. Blackburns letters were featured on Fox News on Tuesday, before H.H.S. received them.StemExpress was never given the opportunity to comment on the dozens of pages of documents appended to the letters. Several of these documents appear to come from the Center for Medical Progress.The letters, which are posted on the House Energy and Commerce Committees website, include the names of researchers and employees of StemExpress and Planned Parenthood, potentially putting them at risk of harassment or violence by anti-abortion extremists.In her opening statement at the panels first hearing, Ms. Blackburn claimed that something very troubling is going on related to fetal tissue and research.Since then, the panels goal has been to convince the public of that, regardless of what the evidence shows.Update:A spokesman for Ms. Blackburn told Rewire on Friday that the congresswomans staff had made an error by failing to redact thenames of researchers and othersfrom letters to H.H.S. posted online.The chairman has been very clear about redacting the names and staff just made a mistake, the spokesman, Mike Reynard, said. Redacted letters have been posted on the House Energy and Commerce Committee website, but on Monday afternoon, links in a press release sent last week by Ms. Blackburns office still pointed to unredacted versions."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced on Thursday that Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who won historic Supreme Court rulings for the Obama administration on its signature health care law and on same-sex marriage, would be stepping down as the nations top appellate lawyer.Mr. Verrilli, 58, has been the solicitor general for five years, arguing the administrations position before the justices during an unusual wave of contentious cases that drew attention far outside the legal world.President Obama credited Mr. Verrilli in a statement with winning landmark cases that moved America forward, while Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in announcing his departure that Don has been at the center of the foremost legal challenges of our time.Mr. Verrillis two most important wins will most likely be remembered as the Supreme Courts 2012 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, and its decision last year declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.The estimated 20 million Americans who gained health care under the Affordable Care Act are the ultimate beneficiaries of Don Verrillis extraordinary work, Kathleen Sebelius, who as secretary of health and human services worked with Mr. Verrilli to uphold the law, said in a statement.The victories were not always graceful, however.Mr. Verrillis sometimes halting performance during oral arguments before the justices in the Affordable Care Act case was widely maligned, even earning him ridicule on late-night television from Jon Stewart.But the courts decision upholding the health care law proved a vindication, and Mr. Obama called him that day to thank him.One of Mr. Verrillis arguments for upholding the law was that the penalty for not obtaining health insurance amounted to a tax, not a forced purchase. The argument was critical in earning the deciding vote, by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., in the 5-4 decision.In that case and others, Mr. Verrilli proved adroit at developing legal strategies targeting particular justices, said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University.He wasnt a flashy lawyer, and there werent a lot of sound bites, Mr. Adler said. But when one looks at his time in office and the cases he argued, history will show that he was a very effective advocate  and very effective at counting to five and developing legal strategies that got the job done.Mr. Verrilli did endure a few big losses that Obama administration officials regretted.In 2013, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, passed during the civil rights era, and freed nine states  most in the South  to change election laws without federal approval.The next year, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the court thrilled religious groups when it ruled that requiring family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception violated federal law.The solicitor general, a position often known as the 10th justice because appearances before the court are so frequent, has an office inside the Supreme Court.While Mr. Verrillis appearances before the court certainly earned him visibility, the bigger measure of his job was in deciding what position the Justice Department should take in thousands of appeals in the federal courts, he told a hometown audience in Wilton, Conn., in 2014.Thats what I spend most of my time on, he said, according to The Wilton Bulletin. Arguing cases is a very small part of the job.A graduate of Yale and Columbia Law School, Mr. Verrilli was a clerk for Justice William J. Brennan Jr. and argued a dozen cases before the Supreme Court in private practice before joining the Justice Department in 2009.Mr. Obama nominated him in 2011 as solicitor general to succeed Elena Kagan after she was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice. The Senate confirmed him to the post by a vote of 72-16. Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who was the only senator to speak against him during the floor debate, said he was concerned that Mr. Verrilli and the administration would not be tough enough in terrorism cases.Mr. Verrilli will step down on June 24. He made no announcement about his plans, but Mr. Obama wished him a well-deserved vacation.The Justice Department said that Ian Gershengorn, the principal deputy under Mr. Verrilli, would serve as acting solicitor general."}
{"text": "PITTSBURGH  One was a wildly successful artist, the son of Slovakian immigrants, whose alabaster complexion and shock of white hair made him instantly recognizable on the streets of Manhattan.The other was a shy film school student from Beijing who toiled in anonymity, sketching $20 sidewalk portraits to make the rent on his basement apartment.And though their paths crossed at more than one downtown art opening in the 1980s, it is safe to say that Ai Weiwei, the young Chinese striver, made little impression on Andy Warhol as he flitted through the adoring throngs.I remember going to a gallery opening and hearing people say Andy is here, Andy is here, and suddenly I saw him through the crowd, Mr. Ai recalled this week, walking through Andy Warhol/Ai Weiwei at the Warhol Museum here. It was incredible to be in the same room, but I was a nobody.In the 25 years since he abruptly left New York to tend to his ailing father in China, Mr. Ai has become a somebody. Wily provocateur, enemy of the state and media-savvy advocate for the disenfranchised, he is a darling of the global contemporary art world, a bona fide celebrity whose burly, bearded presence invariably draws admiring crowds.Andy Warhol and Ai Weiwei, it turns out, have plenty in common.Like Warhol, Mr. Ai surrounds himself with stray cats, has a fondness for neon-tinted floral arrangements and takes pleasure in subverting hallowed cultural touchstones.Both men have also made a mint turning everyday objects into sought-after commodities. And Mr. Ai, like Warhol, compulsively records his life and surroundings  Warhol had his tape recorder; Mr. Ai always has his iPhone, which he uses almost hourly to post a deluge of images to Instagram and Twitter.But the two men are conjoined by something more significant: They are both unrepentant iconoclasts and gleeful disrupters of art world conventions. Warhol scandalized with his soup cans in 1962; three decades later, Mr. Ai defiled neolithic Chinese pottery with tutti-frutti-colored paint, and he once famously smashed a Han dynasty urn just for the heck of it.The things said about Warhol are intriguingly similar to what was said about Ai Weiwei today  that he desecrated art, said Eric Shiner, director of the museum, which is staging a dialogue show of the two mens works that runs through August. Yet in reality, both artists changed, and are changing, how the world understands art and how art penetrates the world.Such commonalities are on full display at the museum. One room juxtaposes Warhols garishly tinted Mao Zedong with Mr. Ais own vaguely sardonic portraits of the Great Helmsman; another places Warhols Coca-Cola paintings alongside a centuries-old Chinese vase that Mr. Ai scrawled with the Coke trademark logo.As he glimpsed the galleries on Thursday for the first time, Mr. Ai seemed genuinely taken aback by how Warhol had influenced his work, often unconsciously. (Mr. Ai was first exposed to the artist after arriving in New York, when he bought a dog-eared copy of Warhols ironic quotations at The Strand.)Its as if we were brothers, he said, noting the similarities of Warhols early birds-eye ink sketches of the Manhattan skyline to his own youthful renderings of Shanghais rooftops. Who could imagine that a poor Chinese kid would one day be showing his work alongside Andys?The past few days have been especially emotional for Mr. Ai, who has not been here in eight years. He spent several years in internal exile after the Chinese authorities jailed him for 81 days on spurious charges of tax evasion and then refused to relinquish his passport.Last July, the police finally relented, and Mr. Ai promptly decamped to Berlin, joining his partner and their 7-year-old son, who live there. In addition to lecturing at Berlins University of the Arts  a position he was offered just before his arrest  he has spent the past year working at a feverish pace.His studio, which occupies an old brewery in what once was East Berlin, has become a frenetic hub, staffed by an international coterie of assistants  not unlike Warhols Factory. Mr. Ai also opened a studio on the Greek island of Lesbos, where he plans to build a memorial to the thousands of refugees who have died crossing the Mediterranean. And every month, it seems, there is a new exhibition of his work  in Australia, England, Austria, and in New York.Mr. Ai has spent much of the year immersed in the migrant crisis. He has handed out solar-powered lamps to children in refugee camps, delivered a white grand piano to a traumatized Syrian pianist and photographed the freshly arrived as they scrambled off boats in Lesbos.Last month, he traveled to the West Bank and Gaza for a documentary film he is making about refugees around the world.Mr. Ai, 58, appeared exhausted by the travel, but said he wouldnt have it any other way. You have to work when the light bulb is bright, he said, pointing to his head, because over time, it will dim.His work has not been without controversy. In February, he was widely skewered after he posed for a photograph lying on a pebble beach  an image meant to evoke the photo of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who drowned off the coast of Turkey. A few weeks later, during a Berlin Film Festival gala, he directed celebrity guests to don the metallic thermal blankets that volunteers give to arriving immigrants. Berlins culture minister called the gesture obscene.Mr. Ai, unsurprisingly, is unfazed by the uproar. Art is supposed to make people feel uncomfortable, to change the way they look at the world, he said. Ive been receiving criticism my whole life, but if youre going to throw a punch, it should be a real punch, not this kind of mediocre criticism.His work may occasionally tack to the incendiary, but in person Mr. Ai is a calm, self-effacing presence  seemingly little changed from his days as the hungry East Village artist who threw away his paintings each time he was forced to change apartments.Dressed in a black T-shirt and cheap cloth shoes, he speaks just a notch above a whisper. As workers made last-minute tweaks to the gallery lighting, Mr. Ai was transfixed by the wall of photos he took during his New York years: images of the 1988 riots in Tompkins Square Park; a snapshot of Allen Ginsberg urinating; and numerous portraits of a reed-thin and naked Mr. Ai posing like the Venus de Milo.No one was interested in showing the work of a Chinese artist back then, he said, shaking his head, and turning to a wall of photographs documenting Warhols 1982 trip to China.Even as Mr. Ai revels in his newfound freedom, he is mindful that the life of an exiled dissident has its drawbacks. Living in Europe, he said, has diminished his voice as a human rights advocate in China. Unlike most persecuted activists who have been given the chance to leave, Mr. Ai refuses to seek asylum.Next week, he will return to Beijing for a visit, a journey that fills him with trepidation. Mr. Ai says he wants to see family and friends, but he also wants to demonstrate to the Chinese authorities that he has not abandoned his homeland. Things there are dreadful right now, he said, referring to the unremitting government crackdown that has jailed pro-democracy activists, human rights lawyers and journalists, some of them his friends.But he seemed somewhat conflicted about his role  an exiled government critic or someone who willingly, and perhaps foolishly, steps back into the dragons maw. Its not honest for a real Chinese fighter to be outside, he mused. Youre just throwing stones."}
{"text": "Ask Real Estate is a weekly column that answers questions from across the New York region. Submit yours to realestateqa@nytimes.com.Pot-Smoking TeenagerI plan to sell my apartment in a small condominium. My neighbors teenage son smokes copious amounts of marijuana with his friends, presumably when his parents arent home. The scent is overwhelming and likely a big turnoff to prospective buyers. I cannot risk this happening when I am showing the apartment to a prospective buyer or holding an open house. I dont want to rat the boy out  and the building is not smoke-free  but a major financial deal is at stake. What would you suggest?TriBeCa, ManhattanEven if you drench your apartment in air fresheners and make the teenager promise to abstain during the open house, whoever ultimately buys your apartment will certainly notice a cloud of pot smoke after moving in. And if it bothers the buyer, he or she might blame you for hiding the teenagers habit.Its an ethical issue, and it could turn into a legal issue, said Steven D. Sladkus, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. Someone could say that you intentionally hid something or misled them.Buyers lawyers frequently ask sellers to disclose any nuisances. If you remain silent on this issue, a disgruntled buyer could argue that you committed fraud in the contract by keeping mum about smoke and odors. To protect yourself, clear the air before you put the apartment on the market.Rat the kid out, Mr. Sladkus said. Try to resolve the problem, so it doesnt exist anymore.Talk to the parents. Given pots distinctive scent, they might not be surprised to learn about their sons activities. Nevertheless, parents can be sensitive and defensive when it comes to their children  and they may not object to his choice of entertainment even though recreational use of marijuana is still illegal in New York. (It has, however, been somewhat decriminalized.)The seller should call that parent and have an I need your help conversation, said Kathy Braddock, a managing director at William Raveis New York City. Gently inform your neighbor that your listing agent has advised you to address any potential problems before the apartment goes on the market. Explain that you want to get the best possible price for your home, which would benefit everyone in the building, and the aroma of lingering pot smoke will probably not help you achieve that goal.You could also tell them that the odor bothers you and may bother whoever owns your apartment next.As Ms. Braddock noted, This is a real quality-of-life issue. If the seller asks for help from the parent, they will most likely get it.Locked OutMy mother moved out of her co-op and into an assisted-living facility. Her co-op is held in a trust of which she, my sister and I are trustees; my mother is the guarantor. In October, I sent a letter to the co-op board stating that my husband and two children were going to stay in the apartment for four days over Christmas. I didnt hear back until January, when I received a letter from the managing agent denying us complete access to the apartment. It stated that if we attempted entry, we would be in default of the proprietary lease. Is the board permitted to do this? Who will maintain the apartment if not us?Upper East Side, ManhattanI can understand why you might want to stay at your mothers apartment for a few days, even if she no longer lives in it. You are family. But co-op boards can be very strict about enforcing occupancy rules, and the trust, not you, owns the apartment. As far as the board is concerned, you are not a shareholder, but merely the guarantors daughter, said Slava Hazin, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.Paul R. Gottsegen, the president of the Halstead Management Company, added that boards dont want shareholders determining who their neighbors are.A standard proprietary lease restricts how long guests can stay and usually requires a permitted adult to be present. In this case, that adult would be your mother, who, in all likelihood, cannot chaperone because she lives elsewhere. Boards may make an exception to such rules, but they are not required to do so, Mr. Hazin said.Hire a lawyer to review the proprietary lease and any agreement between the co-op and the trust to determine your rights and ensure the board has not overstepped its bounds. If you find that you and your family have no legal right to stay, try to reason with management anyway. Explain that you need to clean and maintain the apartment. Presumably the board would like to see the property cared for, too.With a little heartfelt pleading, the board might soften its draconian stance. If it holds firm, you could potentially sue for access. But thats an expensive, lengthy and unpredictable process.Missing LockboxMy in-laws, who live in an assisted-living facility, signed an exclusive agreement with a broker to sell their co-op apartment. Last week, the broker called us asking if we had removed the lockbox, which contained a key so other brokers could show the apartment. When we went to the apartment, the box was indeed missing from the door. Now were not sure what to do.Beechhurst, QueensYou need to start by figuring out what happened to that box. A call to the super or managing agent could shed light on the issue. If the building has a policy prohibiting such boxes, someone on the staff might have removed it.If the mystery of the vanishing box is not resolved with a phone call, then you need to secure the property  and fast.The locks to the apartment should be changed immediately, said Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.Once the property is safe, you or your in-laws should have a frank discussion with the broker. My first question to the agent would be, Why were you using a lockbox in the first place?  said Robert Whalen, an associate broker at Halstead Property.Brokers sometimes use these boxes to provide access to an apartment when they cannot be present, but that is obviously not a good system for this apartment, since no one is living in the apartment to monitor the condition of the box. A lockbox might be O.K. if the agent has a scheduling conflict, Mr. Whalen said, but it should not be the normal practice.You and your in-laws need to know how the broker plans to proceed. Your parents-in-law should feel confident that the broker will give their property the attention it deserves and protect it while it is in his care."}

They used this basic recipe.In World War II, women in the Red Cross, known as Doughnut Dollies, did the same to ensure that the treat was available.Today, Krispy Kreme is giving out free doughnuts.

{"text": "Prince, the music icon who struggled with debilitating hip pain during his career, died from an accidental overdose of self-administered fentanyl, a type of synthetic opiate, officials in Minnesota said Thursday.The news ended weeks of speculation about the sudden death of the musician, who had a reputation for clean living but who appears to have developed a dependency on medications to treat his pain.Authorities have yet to discuss how he came to be in possession of the fentanyl and whether it had been prescribed by a doctor.Officials had waited several weeks for the results of a toxicology test undertaken as part of an autopsy performed after he was found dead April 21 in an elevator at his estate. He was preparing to enroll in an opioid treatment program when he died at 57, according to the lawyer for a doctor who was planning to treat him.The Midwest Medical Examiners Office, which conducted the autopsy, declined to comment beyond releasing a copy of its findings. The Carver County Sheriffs Office is continuing to investigate the death with help from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. The sheriffs office had said it was looking into whether opioid abuse was a factor, and a law enforcement official had said that painkillers were found on Prince when investigators arrived.The M.E. report is one piece of the whole thing, said Jason Kamerud, the countys chief deputy sheriff.Fentanyl is a potent but dangerous painkiller, estimated to be more than 50 times more powerful than heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report did not list how much fentanyl was found in Princes blood. Last year, federal officials issued an alert that said incidents and overdoses with fentanyl were occurring at an alarming rate throughout the United States.Weeks before his death, Prince postponed a concert in Atlanta, saying that he had the flu. A week later, he made up the show, but on the flight home to Minneapolis, he fell unconscious and his private jet made an emergency landing in Moline, Ill. There, emergency medical personnel treated him with Narcan, a drug typically used to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the matter.Prince told his friends and associates after that emergency that he was O.K. His publicist said he had the flu and that this was what had led to the emergency landing.But a concerned friend later reached out to a California-based doctor who specializes in treating opioid addictions, in hopes of getting him into treatment, according to William Mauzy, a lawyer for the doctor, Howard Kornfeld.On April 20, Dr. Kornfeld sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who is not a doctor but works at his fathers clinic, on a red-eye flight to Princes Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen, Minn., Mr. Mauzy said. But when Andrew Kornfeld arrived on the morning of April 21, he and two members of Princes staff found the singer lifeless. He then called 911.Andrew Kornfeld was carrying a drug used to treat opioid addiction, but Mr. Mauzy said he hoped his client, who was not authorized to dispense medications, would not be charged with any crime, in part because of a good Samaritan law that allows people to call 911 to get someone help without worrying about criminal consequences. Mr. Mauzy said neither Kornfeld had given Prince any medication.The medical examiners report listed Prince, who was 5-foot-3, as weighing 112 pounds and said he had been dressed all in black that morning, including a black cap.His death came at a time when an opioid addiction epidemic has been sweeping the United States. Studies showed that more than 28,000 people died from opioids, which includes heroin and painkillers, in 2014, and 4.3 million people were taking pain medication for nonmedical purposes that year.Fentanyl can be consumed in a variety of ways, including through patches, injections, smoking and a lollipop. It is unclear what method Prince used.Dr. Torin Finver, an addiction medicine specialist at the Jacobs School of Medicine at the University at Buffalo, said it can be easier to overdose on the drug because its effects last shorter than they do for other opiates, thus leading users to dose more frequently and possibly consume too much.The illicit shipment of fentanyl into the United States has become a major concern for federal officials, who say the substance has become an increasingly popular product of drug cartels in Mexico and is often mixed with heroin.Princes body was worn down from decades of taxing performances, in which he often did splits or jumped from heights in platform shoes, several people close to him said. One person who knew him said that Prince had hip surgery in the mid-2000s, but it did not completely alleviate his pain. The medical examiners report noted a scar on Princes left hip as well as one on his lower right leg.To some of Princes closest friends and colleagues, his struggle with pain medication came as a surprise because the musician had become a Jehovahs Witness and strove, friends said, to live such a clean life. He was averse to drinking alcohol and frowned on the use of recreational drugs. He typically ate a vegan diet, and would not allow meat in his house.It doesnt matter what people say after you are gone, Cassandra ONeal, Princes keyboardist for the last seven years, said after being told of the overdose report. What matters is what they meant to you when they were here. Prince is still a genius and one of the most gifted artists I ever worked with.Investigators have used search warrants as they look for evidence in the case and collected records from medical personnel who treated him in the final months of his life, including one Minnesota doctor, Michael Schulenberg who had seen him the day before he died.It was unclear what Dr. Schulenberg saw Prince for, but he had also seen him weeks earlier, the same day that Prince had postponed the Atlanta show. Dr. Schulenberg also prescribed medications for Prince, according to an affidavit filed by an investigator in support of a search warrant, though it did not specify the drugs.There has been no indication from investigators that Dr. Schulenberg prescribed opiates to Prince. He was interviewed on April 22, said Amy S. Conners, the doctors lawyer, and fully cooperated and has received no further requests from any investigators."}

Other times the celebrity would cooperate, particularly if crab or snail was on offer, drawing huge crowds to this farming hamlet on the northern coast of Taiwan after each sighting.The subject of such adoration was not a teenage Mandopop star in hiding but a bird  a Siberian crane, one of fewer than 4,000 in the world and the only one ever seen on this Asian island on the edge of the tropics.Environmentalists called him the little white crane of Jinshan, after the rural district where he spent most of his time, and his movements were tracked on Facebook and in the local news media. After he briefly ventured south over the mountains and took temporary refuge in the parking lot of a Taipei subway station, satellite trucks lined the country roads to monitor his return.The local government hired a full-time bodyguard to look out for the crane, who faced threats from feral dogs and powerful typhoons. But the biggest problem was the sightseers.They were hard to control, Chuang Kuo-liang, the birds guard, said. They wanted to get close and touch him.I first encountered bird-watching in Taiwan when I lived in Taipei in 2014. Walk through any park in the city or bike the trails lining its rivers, and you will inevitably encounter a gaggle of bird-watchers with tripod-mounted cameras. They stand on muddy banks and circle around trees with nests, patiently waiting for a glimpse of a treasured creature.You have to wait, because you dont know when it will return, said Kao Twan-kao, a retired civil engineer who was watching the nest of a Taiwan barbet on a rainy afternoon in Taipeis Daan Forest Park. Sometime you will only see it once every few hours.The Taiwan barbet is known in Chinese as the five-colored bird for its green, red, yellow, blue and black plumage. One was waiting in the nest, a hole in a slender tree trunk, while its mate was out searching for food. We were lucky. After a few minutes, the brightly colored bird stuck its head out into the gloomy light of day.These birds are so cute, said one bird-watcher, Chen Jia-hu, as he watched alongside his camera. So we all want to protect them and protect the environment.Mr. Chen pulled out his phone to show me a Facebook feed of stunning images of birds that he had photographed around Taipeis parks. Some, like the noisy and gregarious Taiwan blue magpie, are endemic to the island, meaning it is the only place they live and breed in the wild. Others like the Malayan night heron, which wobbles its neck while feeding on bugs and earthworms, can be found across much of Asia.Several migratory birds, including the endangered black-faced spoonbill, spend winters on the island, too.The Siberian crane was an anomaly. The bird was less than a year old when he arrived in December 2014, with cinnamon-brown feathers on his back and head. Later, as his adoring fans in Taiwan looked on, those colors gave way to pure white with black primary feathers.Siberian cranes can live up to 80 years, but they are critically endangered. Fewer than 20 remain in western Siberia, migrating to Iran in the winters. A population in central Siberia that used to winter in India disappeared more than a decade ago.The remaining cranes are in eastern Siberia and spend their winters in southeast China, downriver from the Three Gorges Dam at Poyang Lake, the countrys largest freshwater lake, which has experienced periods of extreme drought in recent years. The local environmental bureau has sometimes scattered corn to ensure that the birds have an adequate food supply.In the past there was always a balance, but now because of climate change, because of the man-made control of the water, cranes are facing a situation where they depend on humans to feed them to survive, said Chiu Ming-yuan, the deputy executive director of the Taiwan Ecological Engineering Development Foundation. And all the worlds Siberian cranes are in that one place. Its a very dangerous situation.The Jinshan crane, though, was apparently blown off course while flying to Poyang with his parents, landing 400 miles to the southeast in Taiwan to the thrill of the islands avid bird-watchers. He stands close to five feet tall, with long thin legs and wings that stretch more than seven feet. He would spend his days wading through the flooded fields, making plaintive honks as he searched for snails and fish.Mr. Chiu, whose organization took up the cause of the birds protection, said that some 50,000 to 60,000 people made the journey to see him in Jinshan, which lies in a sliver of flatlands between the mountains of Yangmingshan National Park and the East China Sea.When this bird first came here, it not only attracted so many photographers, but also so many children who came with their school classes, Mr. Chiu said. And we began to think of what could we change in Taiwan, what could we change in the world.Local environmentalists seized on the cranes visit to promote the preservation of wetlands. Mr. Chius organization also persuaded farmers in the area to not use herbicides and pesticides on their crops to provide a better habitat for migratory birds. They also marketed the organic rice and lotus root produced here under the birds name, with a cartoon image of his red face on the package.And Mr. Chiu said his foundation gave farmers a stipend to compensate them for all the lotus root seedlings the crane devoured.Noah Strycker, a bird-watcher and writer who visited Taiwan last year as part of a world tour during which he says he spotted a record 6,042 bird species, said he had never seen such enthusiasm over fowl.I saw other attention-getting birds in 2015, including little penguins in Australia that drew hundreds of curious onlookers and a rare Golden Masked-Owl in New Guinea, he said by email, but the crane in Taiwan was the only one with its own 24-hour security guard.Mr. Strycker, who first visited Taiwan in 2003, said he had noticed a marked increase in interest in bird-watching on the island fueled by cheaper photographic equipment, more complete field guides and the growing availability of online resources for birders to share and communicate.On this visit, I saw dozens of people with huge cameras where I saw none in 2003, he said. The birds havent changed, but interest in them has skyrocketed in the past decade.In May, the Jinshan crane made a few trips along Taiwans northern coast, and then one day he was gone. Researchers say he probably flew across the Taiwan Strait to mainland China and then north to join his comrades in Siberia.While farmers plan to continue refraining from using herbicides and pesticides, no one knows if the crane will return.If he wants to leave, we should support him, said Huang Cheng-chun, one of the farmers whose rice paddies the crane called home. I hope he has a smooth trip to see his family. I hope next year he comes back with a girlfriend."}
{"text": "He told me to stop by after I got out of the movie. We met in the parking lot outside his dorm and kissed hello, quickly, like something you do out of habit. I didnt know then that it would be our last. He was tense, his eyes focused everywhere but on me.I dont remember exactly what he said, but he ended with: I dont think I can do this anymore.My heart pounded as he gave his reasons. I listened but didnt process. I stood there in the cold, swaying nervously from foot to foot, my hands shoved inside my jacket pockets. I tried to respond but stumbled over my words. Normally outgoing and talkative, I couldnt even form a sentence. Warmth radiated from my flushed cheeks.As a student of neuroscience, I have learned that the most intimate relationship is the one between your head and heart. They talk like best friends via the common carotid artery, which sends blood from the heart to the brain at a running speed of three feet per second.The brain has developed mechanisms to sense danger, and it responds immediately in the presence of any threat. When a threat is identified, an emergency call is made to the hypothalamus, the command center for our hormone system.The hypothalamus then kicks the sympathetic nervous system into gear, surging cortisol through our veins. Adrenaline floods our system. Our heartbeat quickens, strengthening the flow of blood to our vital organs. Our airways open. With each breath, we are more alert. Our pupils dilate. In the presence of danger, we are prepared to fight.This is not what happens in a breakup.The physiological response to a rejection is entirely different from that of a threat. We have an innate need for acceptance, just like we need water and food to survive. In a manner somewhat opposed to when were faced with a threat, rejection activates our parasympathetic nervous system.A signal is sent through the vagus nerve from our brain to our heart and stomach. The muscles of our digestive system contract, making it feel as if theres a pit in the deepest part of our stomach. Our airways constrict, making it harder to breathe. The rhythmic beating of our heart is slowed so noticeably that it feels, literally, like our heart is breaking.After hearing those fateful words of rejection in the parking lot, I went home and cried on the floor of my apartment, tucked into my best friends embrace.Everyone has a first heartbreak, she said gently. The first one just hurts the worst.I felt like such a clich, crying until I had a headache and plowing through an entire box of tissues. Studying neuroscience had taught me too much. I knew how the chemicals in my brain were driving my emotions. I wanted to use science to reason with myself, to convince myself that soon the hormones would stabilize and I would start to feel better.Unfortunately, years of schooling cant teach you about recovering from heartbreak the way experience can.I wanted to go back to the middle of our relationship. I didnt miss the beginning: the insecurity, the butterflies and that period of awkwardness when youre just getting to know each other. And I definitely didnt want to revisit the end. I wanted to return to the middle, when everything was calm, routine and dependable. It was easy then, and pain-free.We were both active and engaged in our own spheres of campus life, and our paths never crossed until a mutual friend set us up on a blind date.It wasnt surprising that we had never met; he is a student athlete, and I can barely walk without tripping. While he was finishing problem sets in the engineering building, I was running experiments across campus in my neuroscience lab.Our connection was intense and effortless. When we worked side by side in his room or mine, I felt remarkably safe amid the kind of silence that usually makes me feel too vulnerable.I loved the way he slid his fingers into mine as we walked home and how he sometimes squeezed my first finger with his thumb extra tightly, just to remind me that he was there. The electricity from his touch sent a cascade of oxytocin from my posterior pituitary, lowering my cortisol levels and enveloping me with unspoken compassion.With dopamine bursting out of my nucleus accumbens, I would be engulfed by feelings of exhilaration and bliss. Id fall asleep next to him with my hand on his chest, calmed by the metronome of his heartbeat.It is no coincidence that positive emotions feel so good; the hormones released when youre happy, in love and feeling appreciated all help regulate your heartbeat into a coherent pattern. The fixed beating sets a rhythm for the rest of your body so that all other homeostatic mechanisms are carried out in sync. With my body in equilibrium, living felt much easier.I wish I could say I got over my heartbreak quickly. To let others think I did, I kept my pain private, crying in the shower and at night when I hoped my roommates wouldnt hear.I felt embarrassed as I remembered my mother saying, If he doesnt want you, you dont want him. I tried to dedicate myself to my friends and to the course work that would prepare me for my medical school applications a few months later. I wanted to be like Elle Woods in Legally Blonde: confident and self-reliant.But heartache is like any other pain, and it takes time to heal.Whats crazy about the pain of a broken heart is that your body perceives it as physical pain. Love activates the same neurological reward centers as cocaine, and losing love can feel like going through withdrawal after quitting drugs or alcohol cold turkey.Regardless of whether were in pain from withdrawal or experiencing an emotional rejection, neurons in our anterior cingulate cortex and insula start firing. We think the only way to feel better is to experience the high again; we physically crave it.Like addicts, we cant think clearly and argue with ourselves over every decision: Should I call him? No, dont be desperate. As pain receptors fire, the result is that we feel broken, physically and emotionally.What I didnt know at the time, though, is that there is a saving grace. Modern medicine provides an over-the-counter remedy that has been shown to ameliorate the emotional effects of heartbreak.In research published in 2010, scientists found that acetaminophen can reduce physical and neural responses associated with the pain of social rejection, whether in romantic relationships, friendships or otherwise.So if youre hurting from heartache, try popping some Tylenol.Withdrawal eventually ends, and so does the pain of rejection. I hate how much I cried and all the time wasted missing him. I hate how much it hurt, but still feel so grateful for the relationship we had because it taught me what it means to love and be loved.Now I know what I want: a relationship that will fill me with dopamine and steady my heartbeat when he entwines his fingers with mine. Ill know its right when I can talk freely for hours, yet also be at ease in silence. I dont spend so much time searching for that feeling anymore, wondering how love should feel, because Ill recognize it when it comes and wont force it if its not there.Recently, I broke someone elses heart. He was a friend first, but he said he wanted to be more. I gave it a few weeks, because he deserved that. We went out to breakfast one day, lunch another and dinner sometime after that. It felt nice to be with someone who cared so much about me, but my nucleus accumbens was quiet. There was no dopamine high when he held my hand, and my heartbeat wasnt settled on a rhythm that matched his.I tried to end it with kindness and respect, but there was obvious strain and confusion in his eyes as his parasympathetic nervous system kicked into gear while I gave my reasons. I could imagine the muscles of his digestive system contracting, his heartbeat slowing.I had been there. I knew he would be O.K., and wanted to tell him so, but experience had taught me that I was the wrong person to help.This conflict of my head and heart  of my wanting to offer comfort but knowing I shouldnt  was making my pulse race and my body tremble. So I simply hugged him goodbye and walked away, hoping that someone else would think to give him Tylenol."}

Cernan soared into orbit today [June 3] after a perfect takeoff, but problems threatened the scheduled linkup with a target vehicle in space. Geminis orbital manoeuvres started off well with a successful docking adapter (ATDA). But then, with the target only ten feet away, the astronauts found their linkup blocked by a shroud over the docking cone that made the target look like an angry alligator with its jaws agape. Ground control then postponed the linkup indefinitely, leaving open the possibility that Lt. Comdr. Cernan might be sent into space to dislodge the shroud.

{"text": "HONG KONG  In a packed bidding room last Monday, Christies Hong Kong hosted its 30th-anniversary auction. The tightly curated catalog featured 30 lots, each chosen for its desirability and origin in categories such as fine art, ancient ceramics, jewelry, watches and rare wines.And handbags.One of the auctions stars was a 12-inch Herms Birkin matte Himalayan crocodile handbag, with white-gold hardware set with 245 F-color diamonds weighing close to 10 carats. With a presale estimate of $190,000 to $260,000, it was billed as the most valuable handbag in the world.The standing-room-only crowd, mostly from mainland China, with a smattering of collectors from Taiwan and Japan, watched with barely bated anticipation as Jussi Pylkkanen, the global president for Christies, presided from the podium over bidders who drove prices for the Birkin quickly past $128,679 (or about 1 million Hong Kong dollars). In a mere four minutes, the bag was sold (to a private collector), and a record set, at $244,490, before a buyers premium (for a total of $300,168, just over the standard retail price of $280,000).That an Herms Birkin fetched more money than a hanging scroll belonging to the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing dynasty (1 million Hong Kong dollars), or a rare solar-powered dome clock by Patek Philippe (also 1 million Hong Kong dollars), is testament to the mythical status the bag commands.Our London office began auctioning off fashion items as part of estate sales in the 1990s, and in 2000 began including contemporary handbags as collectors pieces, said Matthew Rubinger, the Hong Kong-based international director of handbags and accessories for Asia. After a successful stint selling bags in online auctions, Christies opened its handbags and accessories departments in Hong Kong and Paris in 2014. Christies now holds twice-yearly handbag and accessory auctions in Hong Kong, alongside its more traditional sales.As to the frenzy over the Himalayan Birkin (aside from the diamonds), White is the hardest color to achieve with crocodile skin, as you have to remove all of its natural pigment, Mr. Rubinger said of the graduated tone from gray to white, inspired by majestic mountains. To find a bag in its unused condition is even more rare.The seller was a private collector who had owned the unused Birkin since 2008. It is believed that only one or two of these bags are produced each year by the Herms atelier.Mr. Rubingers job is now focused on sourcing the bags for his growing clientele and assessing the quality of the consigned products on a four-grade scale (from a score of one for a brand-new bag to a four for a used one). Many of his customers are clients of Christies and collectors of jewelry and art, but Asias affluent customers are quickly fueling demand.Chanel has always done well in the secondary market, and we also sell Gucci and Balenciaga, but Herms clearly is the leader, he said, adding that the client base is split between Asia and Europe, with many repeat customers.Our previous record-holder was a 35-centimeter fuchsia crocodile Birkin with diamond hardware, which sold for 1.4 million, without the premium, he said, referring to the sale in Hong Kong dollars. Custom orders and exotic skins are always popular. Lizard skin is having a moment right now.It might seem ridiculous to some to treat a handbag as an investment, but for a Birkin collector like Emily Chan, a Hong Kong-based investment banker, it is one worth making. She owns more than 50 of the bags, purchased as a V.I.P. customer from the Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo boutiques, as well as on secondary markets, via auctions. Birkins are both an investment and a fashion accessory to me, she said. Birkins are like currency: You can cash out any time.Of all the ways to access the bags, I like auctions, as you are not shopping alone, she added.Her favorite Birkin is unreservedly the Himalayan. For the past 35 years, the Birkins price trend has been all the way up, performing even better than gold, said Ms. Chan, who began collecting in 1993. Art and jewelry are also good investments, but their barrier to entry is much higher, and those markets, too, have volatility. And they are not as liquid as the Birkin.Birkins have climbed in value by 500 percent in the last 35 years, an increase expected to double in the next 10 years, according to baghunter.com, an online platform for buying and selling luxury handbags.This may be why  even beyond auction houses  a secondary Birkin market run by a handful of resellers has sprung up in settings from Japan to Florida. Brand Offs flagship store in Tokyos Ginza district is just a short walk from Hermss own flagship boutique, while the pre-eminent reseller in Paris, Loc Bocher, the founder of Collector Square, has created the LuxPrice Index, a referencing chart for Herms, as well as for watches and jewelry, with results from about 200,000 auction transactions. He acquires his bags from a network of shoppers in Europe with ties to Herms boutiques, and resells them to customers in the Middle East and Asia. His showroom, elegantly decorated like a home rather than a vintage boutique, displays an array of Herms Birkin and Kelly bags, as well as Chanels classic 2.55 handbag.From our research, we know that the Asian customer prefers the smaller 30-centimeter, Mr. Bocher said, while the European customer likes the 35-centimeter. And the most popular colors are beige, black and brown. For new, unused Birkins, we would have a markup of 10 percent to 20 percent above retail. Our customers are always looking for something unique.We had a Birkin So Black, he continued, referring to a limited-edition style with black hardware released during Jean Paul Gaultiers tenure, which we sold within a few hours of acquisition.Collector Square also works with Artcurial, an auction house to which it sends pieces of exceptional quality and rarity.In the United States, Priv Porter, a dealer based in Boca Raton, Fla., sold a red crocodile Birkin with diamond hardware last year for $298,000. Jeff Berk, Priv Porters founder, who had previously sold liquidated luxury watches, started selling Birkins on eBay in 2012. We received an overwhelming amount of interest on the bags, he said of the two he sold, and my wife and I pulled together $250,000 to invest in our first inventory. Its been a process of consolidation, as we started to work with a V.I.P. clientele, stylists and those who have relatives working at Herms to receive a steady supply of bags.Sixty percent of Mr. Berks clients are from the United States and 30 percent from the Middle East and Asia, with the remainder from South America, he said. He has a staff of five, and a warehouse of about $1.5 million in handbags. There is just something about a Birkin, he said. Its like owning a Mercedes-Benz: When you close the door of a Mercedes, it sounds different than a Toyota. And thats what Herms customers know and buy into. To many of our customers, to own this bag is to achieve a sense of competence like nothing else.In 2014, Robert Smith, a Texas hedge fund titan, and his wife, Hope Dworaczyk, a Playboy Playmate who appeared on Celebrity Apprentice, requested that Mr. Berk find them 30 Birkins to give away at a staff Christmas party. (Their budget was $500,000.) It took us 30 days, but we did it, Mr. Berk said.Ms. Dworaczyk, who is an Herms V.I.P., said: I wasnt expecting them to succeed on the Christmas party. But when I saw the Brinks truck pull up, I lost my mind.All of which makes the fact that Wednesdays follow-up auction at Christies included 200 handbag lots  more than half of which were Birkins  and that handbag sales for the two days totaled $5,044,890 a little more understandable.As handbags become more easily traceable, and values continue to increase, more collectors are seeing their handbags as assets, Mr. Rubinger said. Even those with no intention to sell want to better understand the lasting value of these pieces."}

The police in Murfreesboro arrested four children at Hobgood Elementary School in April and took them away, saying they took part in off-campus bullying. Six other children were named in juvenile court petitions. Parents and community leaders protested, and the Rutherford County prosecutor, Jennings Jones, said Thursday that he would drop the charges.

{"text": "I think the photo community sometimes takes their own and holds them hostage, said the dealer David Zwirner. Its important for Egglestons work to be seen among the great art thats being made. I know thats very important for him in choosing our gallery.Mr. Zwirner was talking about the artist William Eggleston, 76, who has joined his gallery after having been represented by Larry Gagosian for five years.Eggleston is really a living legend of American art, Mr. Zwirner said. And its important for us  and for the artist  that he is contextualized as an artist and not just as a photographer.In November, the gallery, at its West 20th Street location, will mount a show of Mr. Egglestons The Democratic Forest images, taken on his travels in the 1980s.Mr. Eggleston has inspired other artists in the gallery, like Wolfgang Tillmans, Thomas Ruff and Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Mr. Zwirner said. All, in one way or another, he added, have looked at Egglestons work.To some extent, Jim Dine has been the victim of his own success. Or so believes Paul Gray, a partner at Richard Gray Gallery, which will represent Mr. Dine. Although Mr. Dine, 80, had for 40 years been represented by Pace, with whom he parted last year, Richard Gray has featured the artist in shows since 1980.Ive always regarded him as one of the unsung heroes of his generation, Mr. Gray said. His work became kind of pigeonholed because it was so popular.Mr. Dine became known for his Venus sculptures and heart paintings. The pressure to respond to market demand, Mr. Gray said, prevented him from being able to do the things hes doing now.Some of that work will be on view at Art Basel in Switzerland this month, where Richard Gray will present Mr. Dines sculptures of dancers and a self-portrait head in a room of poetry, handwritten by Mr. Dine on the walls.Then on June 24, Mr. Dine will open a solo show of self-portraits at the Albertina Museum in Vienna.And in the fall, Richard Gray will show Mr. Dines latest abstract paintings in Chicago and New York.It seems like just yesterday that Dominique Lvy parted with Robert Mnuchin to open her own gallery, which she did in 2013 at 909 Madison Avenue, sharing the space with Galerie Perrotin. Now Galerie Perrotin is moving out  to an unannounced location  and Ms. Lvy is taking over the entire building.Ms. Lvy will have three exhibition floors, enabling her to simultaneously display the new and historical work of a single artist  like Pat Steir in 2017.It gives us even more flexibility, Ms. Lvy said, and allows us to expand our passion for sculpture.Higher ceilings. That is what fueled Lehmann Maupins new gallery on West 24th Street in a building named the Getty, a former Getty gas station. Peter Marino designed the interiors.Having taken over the Sonnabend Gallery for its current Chelsea home on West 22nd Street, which it will continue to operate along with an East Village location, David Maupin said he was excited to have a new home that was built to our specifications.The new gallery, under construction, is to be completed in 2017.Thodore Rousseau is among the Barbizon school artists who have perhaps been given short shrift as merely precursors to Impressionism. So the J. Paul Getty Museum has decided to give Rousseau his due in an exhibition opening on June 21.The show is called Unruly Nature to highlight the artists tremendous stylistic and technical variety, said Scott Allan, a curator.It was hard to get a handle on this artist and how to categorize certain types of work by him, Mr. Allan said. We wanted to represent the diversity of his achievement.The show will feature more than 70 works that the Getty says makes it the largest Rousseau exhibition since a 1967 retrospective at the Louvre.He was working at an important moment in French landscape painting, Mr. Allan said. Were trying to convey that sense of excitement and experimentation. Its not simply a way station en route to Impressionism.At a time when art prices far exceed the capacity of museum acquisition budgets, six Northeast college and university art museums are joining forces to collect and share new works. The master copy of each acquisition will travel among the museums at Bowdoin, Colby, Mount Holyoke, Brandeis, Middlebury and Skidmore.The first acquisition by this New Media Arts Consortium is William Kentridges Tango for Page Turning (2012-13), a video featuring the turning pages of a 19th-century chemistry book, upon which Mr. Kentridge illustrated images of the South African dancer Dada Masilo.These are not inexpensive works of art, said Sharon Corwin, director of the Colby College Museum of Art. With six institutions rather than one, it made it possible."}
{"text": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been promising for more than a year to rein in the payday lending industry, whose business model relies on luring Americans into ruinously priced loans that can carry interest rates exceeding 400 percent. The proposal that the agency unveiled Thursday represents a down payment on that promise. But the final rule  expected next year  will need stronger, more explicit consumer protections for the new regulatory system to be effective.The industry says it provides a convenient option for consumers, who can get a quick loan and repay it on their next payday, typically in two weeks. The bureau discredited that claim two years ago in a striking study of more than 12 million loans issued in more than two dozen states. Only 15 percent of the borrowers could raise the money necessary to repay the entire debt within 14 days without borrowing again. One in five of these borrowers defaulted at some point, which meant damaged credit and more fees. And nearly two-thirds of them renewed a loan  some more than 10 times  putting them on a path toward ruinous debt.Most people ended up paying more in fees than the amount they borrowed. In other words, the system is expressly designed to bleed borrowers, who are typically struggling workers or people on fixed incomes who are just getting by.When the bureau announced its intent to regulate payday lenders last year, it said that it was considering several safety measures, the most important of which would limit monthly payments to no more than 5 percent of the borrowers expected gross income for the same period. This would have the effect of spreading the costs and fees over the life of the loan, instead of having them come due all at once.The bureau dropped the 5 percent measure from its current proposal  after protests by lenders and others  but should resurrect it in the final version. The proposal would require lenders to determine whether borrowers can repay their loans, but the requirement is dangerously vague and will need to be specified to be effective. It also puts some limits on when a lender can roll over a loan and on how many loans a person can be given in quick succession.The Pew Charitable Trusts small-dollar loans project is especially critical of the proposal. According to its analysis, the new rules would still allow lenders to make high-interest, fee-laden loans  and give a green light to these peddlers of ruin all over the country. The goals for the final rules should be to keep payments affordable and give borrowers enough time to pay their loans.That would constitute a dramatic improvement over the status quo. Such a system would acknowledge the needs of millions of people who lack access to banks and traditional consumer credit, while rejecting a system that bleeds them to death financially for taking out a relatively small loan.The best solution would be for Congress to give the public the same protection from predatory lending that members of the military received under the Military Lending Act of 2007. The rules created under that law made it illegal for lenders to charge more than 36 percent for payday loans, vehicle title loans, installment loans and other forms of credit. (That rate is still quite high.)The point of the law was to prevent deceptive lenders from driving servicemen and women into penury and saddling them with debt that interfered with their service careers. These protections have been good for the military  and they would be just as good for America as a whole."}
{"text": "Nothing says spring quite like a garden party with a dozen plutocrats, along with a handful of big stars. This was what happened two years ago when Madonna and Daniel Craig showed up to the Museum of Modern Arts annual spring gala and rubbed shoulders with the financial world titans Michael R.

And to the surprise of no one in attendance, he looked mildly uneasy with being the focus of so many congratulations. I said Why? he recalled. Why me?

In the bottom of the ninth inning, with two out, two men on base and the score at 4-2, mighty Casey strikes out.Memories of the poem mightve faded with the newsprint, but two months after it was published an actor named DeWolf Hopper recited it at a New York theater before an audience that included players from the New York Giants and the Chicago White Stockings. It was a big success.He went on to perform it more than 10,000 times. (A recording of one performance is kept at the Library of Congress.)While Thayer insisted that Mudville was purely fictitious, residents of Holliston, Mass., and Stockton, Calif., each thought it was their town that had been immortalized.Thayers family owned a mill close to Hollistons Mudville neighborhood, home to a baseball diamond. Some local players had the same Irish names as those in the poem. But Thayer covered Stockton baseball for The Examiner, and players from that area also had similar Irish names.The poem was set to music, broadcast on radio, made into movies, animated and made the basis of an opera. It even appeared in a Supreme Court majority opinion.It also gave us a timeless way to express disappointment: There is no joy in Mudville.Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated on the web all morning.What would you like to see here?

{"text": "Just before the March release of Eat Pray Love Made Me Do It, an anthology of essays written by people who were inspired by Elizabeth Gilberts best-selling 2006 memoir, Eat Pray Love, Ms. Gilbert was looking to offload a 7,000-pound Buddha statue.It was not a matter of spiritual spring cleaning. It was more a matter of cleaning up shop. Her shop.The Buddha is about all thats left, Ms. Gilbert, 46, said over the phone from Miami, where she was taking a break from promoting Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear, her 2015 self-help book.Nearly everything else at Two Buttons, the store in Frenchtown that she and her husband, Jos Nunes, opened in 2007 to sell decorative East Asian imports, had been sold. The business was set to close within weeks.It was great and a really fun project, but my husband and I share this similar trait where once weve made or built something, we no longer have any interest in it, Ms. Gilbert said.So once we got that building renovated and the business was sort of running itself, she continued, he very sheepishly came to me and said, I dont really feel like doing this Two Buttons thing anymore. And around the same time, right after we had finished renovating this big house in Frenchtown, I very sheepishly said to him, I dont really want to live here anymore.Ms. Gilbert and Mr. Nunes have since bought and renovated a smaller house in Frenchtown. Were good at creating, but were not good at sustaining things, she said. And we always let the other person have an out.Ms. Gilbert may be willing to give her husband an out, but letting herself off the hook is another matter. Her followers on social media learned as much last year when, in an effort to practice what she preaches in Big Magic, she sang a karaoke rendition of the Bonnie Tyler chestnut Total Eclipse of the Heart at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Manhattan. The idea was for Ms. Gilbert to face her fear of singing in public.The experience was terrifying, she recalled. Immediately I started to see these really talented people coming in  this is a Midtown bar where people are coming from jobs on Broadway, a very different scene from hanging out at the National Hotel in Frenchtown. She decided to take her name off the waiting list for the microphone.Then her inner scold grabbed hold of her.I said to myself, Youre not allowed to do that anymore. You spend your life telling people they have to take creative risks, and youre about to publish this book thats essentially a manifesto, she said. So she sang.She wrote about the experience on Facebook, but her followers wanted proof; they wanted to see video of Ms. Gilbert singing. So I said, O.K., Ill do it again, she recalled. But this time she introduced a caveat: You guys have to help me raise money.The result? A few more nervous nights in Manhattan and a boon to BlinkNow, a nonprofit based in Morristown that helps poor children in Nepal.Theres this really strange circular connection between me and my fellow New Jerseyan Maggie, Ms. Gilbert said of Maggie Doyne, BlinkNows founder. Hers is another Eat Pray Love Made Me Do It story.Among the essays submitted for inclusion in Eat Pray Love Made Me Do It are descriptions of their writers experiences abandoning bad marriages, learning to embrace motherhood and overcoming addictions. Ms. Doyne, of Mendham, was not a contributor, but she said she was inspired by the memoir just the same. Her story found its way to Ms. Gilbert through a mutual friend.Eat Pray Love was the only book that Ms. Doyne took with her when she left New Jersey to travel to India as a new high school graduate in 2007. It was such an empowering book about a woman who was traveling on a solo journey to find herself, Ms. Doyne wrote in an email from Nepal. \"It inspired me and encouraged me.During her travels, Ms. Doyne, now 28, saw homeless Nepalese children working at difficult, physical jobs. Instead of doing what most of us would do, which is turning away from that kind of despicable situation and saying its so horrible I cant even look, she stayed and created a home for them, Ms. Gilbert said.The home, called the Kopila Valley Childrens Home, was opened to 50 children in 2008. In 2010, BlinkNow also opened a school that now educates over 350 Nepalese children. Ms. Gilbert, through her karaoke stunt, was able to raise more than $100,000 for the organization, Ms. Doyne said.Ms. Gilbert said the money she raised proved the value in overcoming fears.If were being honest about what were afraid of, we have to admit that the stakes are usually terribly low, she said. When you put it in the context of raising money for orphans in Nepal, my singing in public is not a big deal. No one has died from my singing. Yet.That does not mean that a career switch to music is likely. Ms. Gilbert is currently at work on a historical novel about 1940s New York City and promiscuous showgirls there, she said.Frenchtown is a great place to write, especially in the summer, she said. I have this little corner room, with maple leaves advancing on the windows and kids riding their bikes below. Its not as grand or fancy as the other house, but I love being in this little creative community, this Brigadoon-like place."}
{"text": "As leading chefs are turning away from the sea and toward sustainable hatcheries, it seems weve just begun to skim the surface of aquaculture.At Esca, Mario Batalis highly regarded seafood restaurant in New York, customers might be taken aback to know that their fillets of rainbow trout, marinating under a pink blanket of cherry blossoms, were swimming the day before not in any lake, river or sea  but at a farm in New Jersey, where the growth of its gill-bearing inhabitants is carefully monitored. Until recently, favoring wild over farmed fish has been the obvious choice, with much of the latter assumed to be lacking in taste and texture. But with new techniques in breeding and harvesting  such as controlling the salinity of the water, and limiting the population density  forward-thinking chefs, who are as interested in preserving our natural environment as in cooking tasty food, are changing what we eat and from where it comes. And yet, many of them are doing so on the down low. A lot of diners think that farm-raised equals crud, says Michael Anthony of his ambivalence about listing the provenance of the dishes he prepares at New Yorks Gramercy Tavern and Untitled at the Whitney Museum of American Art.While the general public might still need convincing, a growing number of chefs are now discussing merroir the way oenophiles obsess over terroir. One of the more popular farms is Skuna Bay, off the coast of Vancouver Island, which has spacious, glacier-fed pens and a 14-point quality check to make sure that its fish have lush red gills, intact silver scales and thick, muscular bellies. Musky Trout Hatchery in New Jersey, which supplies Esca, supports the health  and healthy appetite  of its fish with an elaborate alarm system that sounds when the oxygen levels of the spring-fed waters drop past an acceptable point.The best farms not only give their fish a nice life, but also a merciful death, corralling them at harvest into smaller schools and sidestepping struggles in a net or on a line  to reduce stress for the fish, which can lead to a soft, sometimes chewy consistency. As with any other type of farming, Michael Costa, the chef at Jos Andrss Zaytinya in Washington, D.C., says that when it comes to fish, the practices determine the results. If the hamachi at Esca, paired with a tangy olive aioli, is any indication, those results are becoming increasingly hard to ignore."}
{"text": "An hour with the celebrity facialist Joanna Czech defies all modern convention. Just when you begin to expect a blast of hot steam to open your pores, shell firmly wipe you down with a swab soaked with ice-cold toner. You think you need a soothing lotion to even your skin out, maybe calm it down? She knows better: a prickly, slightly stinging solution is just the thing. And instead of delicately applying masks and creams, she uses her whole (petite) body to essentially force them into your epidermis  at times politely, yet firmly, slapping them into your face. And so it comes as little surprise that the massage and application techniques she created for La Mer, as the brands global skin-care adviser, arent designed for a light touch.A lot has been written about face massage, and the benefits of sculpting the muscles as you would the rest of your body. And the Polish-born, Dallas-based aesthetician is obsessed: She even found clients to come in to her spa religiously, every other day, for 12 back-to-back deep-tissue face massages. Im always saying, you know, choosing the right product is like nutrition  thats 70 percent. And those little tricks of application, thats your workout, your lifestyle  thats 30 percent. (Czech has a knack for making you feel a little silly for not getting this. I mean, when you work out, what do you do? shell ask. Do you work out your skin? No. You work out your muscles, and then you are in great shape  and then you put on body moisturizer, right?)Her favorite method is not the fanciest, and is easy enough to do at home: what she calls a press/release technique, using deep-tissue-level pressure to tone the faces muscles. Fittingly, she uses the technique especially when applying toner, which is her first step in a skin-care regimen. I like starting with the toner  always that first hydrating moment, its very important. People still forget about the toner and very mistakenly they still use it as a second step of cleansing. What toners really do: They sort of bring balance back to your skin, so they prepare your skin and create healthier PH of the skin, so then automatically your skin absorbs everything so much more easily.Her press/release method is like the one that devoted users of the cult, cool-girl Vintners Daughter serum have grown to love, similarly called a push/press technique. The difference is that the folks at Vintners Daughter suggest practicing it after cleansing and toning, with serum-coated hands, so that the 30 seconds of repeatedly pressing the entire face, neck and dcolletage will help the skin better absorb the potent, all-natural blend.Czech recommends incorporating the technique into a nighttime regimen  and says that not having one is one of the worst skin-care offenses (others being over-exfoliating, and adopting beauty products or practices just because they worked for your friend  since you are special and unique). She says that your skin absorbs products 60 percent better when youre relaxing, and suggests the following before-bed routine:1. Cleanse.2. Apply some form of toner. (In addition to La Mer, she recommends Omorovicza, Biologique Recherche and Environ Skin Care.)3. Top with moisturizer  whichever type suits you best. (It could be a moisturizer that covers the eyes and face in one, she says.)As for the morning: You could do easily in the morning, the same, but I wouldnt use the facial cleanser. I would splash only with water."}
{"text": "FRANKFURT  The European Central Bank made no changes on Thursday in its program to revive the eurozone economy, as it expressed slightly more optimism about the prospects for growth in the region.The lack of any significant policy moves was expected. Growth in the 19-member eurozone is neither so terrible that it requires a new burst of stimulus from the bank nor so torrid that there is a need to apply the brakes, analysts say. The European Central Banks Governing Council is now expected to pause for a while, after several years in which it pushed the boundaries of monetary policy.The bank left its benchmark interest rate at zero, where it has been since March. It also left intact a penalty rate of minus 0.4 percent on money that commercial banks keep at the central bank. The so-called negative interest rate is designed to force commercial banks to lend money rather than hoard it.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said that growth in the eurozone this year would be 1.6 percent, slightly more than earlier forecasts. But the banks economists left their growth predictions for 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 1.7 percent for both years.Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in Vienna that although the risks facing the eurozone had declined, its not a dramatic effect.The bank has already made aggressive moves in recent months by buying government debt in large quantities and cutting interest rates to their lowest levels. This month, the bank will expand those measures by buying corporate bonds and by effectively paying banks to lend to businesses, all in a bid to spur Europes economy.Analysts would have been surprised, indeed shocked, if the bank had taken action on Thursday after a monetary policy meeting in Vienna, one of the Governing Councils periodic forays outside its base in Frankfurt.The bank is also not expected to make any major changes to policy for some time to come. The meeting on Thursday was a continuation of a series of wait-and-see events, Christoph Kutt, head of interest rate strategy at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said in an email.Inflation in the eurozone was minus 0.1 percent in May, according to an official estimate on Tuesday, still far from the banks official target of 2 percent. But a 1 percent increase in the price of services in May, as well as a turnaround in oil prices that has pushed them near $50 a barrel from around half that in January, signal that overall inflation could rise in months to come.To the disappointment of some analysts, the central bank did not raise its inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018. That is a sign that the bank remains concerned about the risk of deflation, a sustained decline in prices that can be disastrous for economic growth and employment.The European Central Banks charter defines its main job as keeping inflation below 2 percent, but not too far below it.Another reason the central bank had not been expected to announce new stimulus on Thursday is that its previous measures are just going into effect. In March, it said it would begin buying corporate bonds in an expansion of its so-called quantitative easing program, a way of pumping money into the economy. Those purchases are scheduled to begin on June 8.In addition, the central bank will begin a program on June 22 intended to address a shortage of credit in countries like Italy. Under some circumstances, the European Central Bank will pay commercial banks to take its money, which the banks must lend to customers.The central bank will want to take some time to see how those programs are working, analysts said.The eurozone economy is recovering, but slowly and unevenly. During the first quarter, the total value of goods and services produced in the eurozone surpassed the previous peak reached in early 2008, before the region was struck by financial and debt crises.But unemployment remains above 10 percent and is falling only gradually, and eurozone growth is not so brisk that economists see any need for the bank to think about removing stimulus to prevent overheating. That is in contrast to the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise interest rates in the United States as early as its next meeting, June 14 and 15.Along with questions about the direction of the economy, there is potential for a new crisis that would push the European Central Bank to mobilize.Britain will hold a referendum on June 23 about whether to remain a member of the European Union. A vote to quit the union would raise concerns that other members would leave, perhaps causing the bloc to fall apart. The uncertainty would have an economic effect, making businesses cautious about hiring and investing.In such a situation, the central bank would be under pressure to intervene once again.Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that he and other members of the Governing Council believed that Britain should remain in the European Union. But if British voters elect to leave, he said, The E.C.B. is ready for all contingencies."}
{"text": "CAIRO  The iron blade of an ornate dagger buried in Egypt with King Tutankhamen probably came from a fallen meteorite, researchers have determined  a form of metal so prized by ancient Egyptians that they called it iron from the sky.The dagger, which was discovered in the folds of the wrapping around the mummified boy king, has long intrigued historians and archaeologists for its great beauty  it has a gold and crystal handle, and an ornate sheath  and because ironwork was rare in ancient Egypt.Using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, Italian and Egyptian experts found that the blades composition of iron, nickel and cobalt was an approximate match for a meteorite that landed in northern Egypt. The result strongly suggests an extraterrestrial origin for the blade, according to their results published this week in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science.The finding could add to secrets unlocked from an ancient tomb that is still a source of global fascination almost a century after its discovery by the English archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922. The dagger was found in 1925.Earlier studies, in the 1970s and 1990s, examined whether the blade came from a meteorite but they were inconclusive or disputed. Newer technology allowed the Italian and Egyptian team, led by experts from Polytechnic University of Milan, the University of Pisa in Italy and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to perform new tests that, they say, appear to settle the matter.Comparing the composition of the dagger with meteorites that landed within a radius of 1,250 miles, they found a close similarity with one that hit the seaport city of Marsa Matruh, 140 miles west of Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast. That finding may help explain why, from the 13th century B.C., Egyptians started using a hieroglyph that translates as iron from the sky, the paper said.The ancient Egyptians, in the wake of other ancient people of the Mediterranean area, were aware that these rare chunks of iron fell from the sky, it said.The intense attention paid by experts to Tutankhamens tomb has not always been matched by staff members at the run-down Egyptian Museum. In January the government said eight people at the state-run museum were being disciplined for their role in a botched repair job that caused minor but lasting damage to King Tuts golden burial mask.The repair job was an attempt to correct the damage caused by workers who had accidentally knocked the beard from the 3,300-year-old artifact in August 2014 as they repaired a light fixture in its display case.Tutankhamen has recently become the focus of renewed interest after a British Egyptologist, Nicholas Reeves, promoted a tantalizing theory that behind the kings burial chamber lies the long-sought tomb of Queen Nefertiti. Other archaeologists, however, strongly dispute that idea, and say nothing of any significance is concealed in the walls of the burial chamber."}
{"text": "PHOENIX  For centuries, ballet has focused all of its stage deportment on one specific arc of space, through a proscenium arch to a large audience. Yet this is such a three-dimensional art that its baffling how few experiments have been made to choreograph it in the round.Ib Andersen, artistic director of Ballet Arizona, addresses this multidimensionality in Round, the most sophisticated work by this skillful choreographer Ive seen to date. The audience (the outermost rows are tiered) surrounds the circular stage; the dancers enter, depart and dance on four broad lanes through the audiences space. The event is all the more spectacular because it is staged in the Desert Botanical Garden here, with cacti-like monuments, lush trees, bright flowers and isolated peaks on the horizon. At the performances I attended after sundown on Tuesday and Wednesday, the evening air was in the 80s, with warm breezes fanning the audience.Merce Cunningham, who made the most radical exploration of in-the-round choreography in modern dance, always told his dancers, Wherever youre facing, thats front. This is true in Round, a piece with many fronts. And yet, quite unlike Cunningham, Mr. Andersen is continually fascinated in this work by symmetry and spatial harmony. He subjects these traditional virtues to continual change and not just through changes of direction.Every time the choreography resolves into a describable image, that image dissolves and becomes the basis for a new construction. Mr. Andersen counters symmetry along one axis (north-south) with symmetry on the opposite axis (east-west) and juxtaposes multiple geometries (a turning ring or star, spirals, parallel lines). He also adds further complexities: Several parts of the work have same-sex partnering, so the different textures of all-male, all-female and male-female dancing are variously explored like different sections of orchestral sound.Intricacy is often matched with simplicity, but theres a recurring sense of paradox. Just what are we seeing? Moment by moment, the answer changes.The music, taped, covers several centuries, starting with two of Thomas Adss Three Studies After Couperin (2010), moving on to two works by Debussy (Syrinx and Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun), and then, after a transitional duet to the Sarabande from Bachs Cello Suite No. 4 in E flat (BWV 1010), ending with Suite No. 2 from Ravels Daphnis and Chlo. Mr. Andersens musicality is among the most subtle facets of his talent; he often avoids the most obvious pulse in the music, but he catches many layers.Syrinx is all-female, both ritualistic and rapturous. The Faun, one of the two finest sections of Round, is all-male; and whats remarkable is how a dance that could so easily tip over into soft-core pornography (nine men in just their undies) stays calmly chaste and indeed classical. The men here are at ease with nature, and we see them lifted, walking on air, descending spiral staircases, climbing steps, plunging into flight. Although the focus is often on a male soloist, it sometimes shifts to a different dancer, creating a marvelous ambiguity of identity that is one of the works most haunting accomplishments.The Bach dance is a male-female duet in which an enigmatic relationship keeps us in suspense. The behavior is both formal and intimate; the woman seems both the mother and playmate of the man. He lies in her lap; they run around the stage with his waist wound in her arm; and in one phrase, he tenderly pushes her backward with his head aimed at her stomach.The other highlight, is the Daphnis and Chlo finale. This begins with the evenings most wonderfully complex passage, with the ensemble fragmented into five or more different groups, all musically motivated and all in changing geometries. Gradually a kind of story emerges  Daphnis and Chlo are reunited by a god  but its abstracted, multiplied. There are two Daphnises and two Chlos, and sometimes they dance different duets at the same time, all within a larger community.The spatial presentation has the variety of a camera moving between close-ups, long shots, traveling sequences. And yet there are memorable tableaus, processions, fixed shapes against which other movement occurs.Ive visited Ballet Arizona five times now. Its repertory  from August Bournonvilles Napoli (the first-ever American production of the 1842 three-act classic, last year) to George Balanchine (the company dances a different program of his work each year) to among the worlds finest Nutcracker presentations  this strikes me as one of the most enterprising companies anywhere.Round is also a celebration of its sensuously stylish, calmly expansive dancers. I single out Nayon Iovino (the chief dancer in Faun; the man in the Bach duet), Natalia Magnicaballi (the solo woman in Syrinx and one of the two Chlos) and Mimi Tompkins (Iovinos partner in the Bach, and the other Chlo), but many others caught the eye."}
{"text": "Minnesota officials reported on Thursday that Prince died in April of an overdose of the opiate fentanyl. The authorities have not revealed how the musician obtained the drug or whether a doctor had prescribed it. But it has been reported that he had hip surgery in the mid-2000s and may have still been in pain.Fentanyl has become a source of concern for government agencies and law enforcement officials as death rates from fentanyl-related overdoses and seizures of the drug have risen in several states. Heres what we know about the drug.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, prescribed to help patients deal with severe pain. Opioids help to reduce patients perception of their suffering and can induce a state of extreme relaxation and euphoria.Fentanyl was synthesized in 1960, and it was introduced as an anesthetic. It is sold under brand names like Actiq, Duragesic and Sublimaze, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.It can be consumed via a patch, an injection, smoking and a lollipop, among other methods.Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine and can be 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Even when taken in small amounts, it can be fatal.Fentanyl is a Schedule 2 drug, meaning that while it is used for medical treatment, it is known to have a high potential for abuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is frequently mixed with heroin, cocaine or both when sold illegally, in many cases without the users knowledge.An overdose of fentanyl can result in severe respiratory depression or arrest, during which breathing is slowed or ceases altogether. But determining what is a standard lethal dose of opioids like fentanyl is complicated. A dose that can kill one person may provide medicinal pain relief for another. And taking prescription opioid painkillers for a long time can build up a tolerance to the drugs.In March 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a nationwide alert about the dangers of fentanyl. It said that the Mexican authorities had shut down several labs and that fentanyl that had been seized in the Northeast and in California in 2014 had originated from Mexican drug-trafficking organizations.In an article in The New York Times in March, Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said fentanyl was the cartels drug of choice.They have figured out a way to make fentanyl more cheaply and easily than heroin and are manufacturing it at a record pace, she said.According to the D.E.A., episodes of abuse involving fentanyl initially appeared in the mid-1970s. From 2005 to 2007, the agency said, the drug caused more than 1,000 deaths in the United States. The fentanyl that caused those deaths originated in a single lab in Mexico that was later shut down, ending the surge."}

{"text": "PARIS  Here he is again on the red clay. For the fourth time in five years, Novak Djokovic is just one victory from completing his collection of Grand Slam singles trophies.He put himself back in position to dream big with a complete and commanding 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 victory over the next-generation threat Dominic Thiem in the French Open semifinals Friday.He doesnt give you any presents, said Thiem, a young man on a roll this season, still looking a bit shellshocked an hour after the drubbing.Djokovic, who has been edgy of late, can certainly be more generous, but he was in top form Friday, snuffing out threats and hope in all areas of the court, above all the corners, his traditional hunting ground.I did not start this tournament like I wanted, but today I played my best match, Djokovic said during his on-court remarks in his fast-improving French.On Sunday, the top-seeded Djokovic will now face No. 2 Andy Murray in what seems an appropriately rigorous final exam as Djokovic tries to finish off his 12-year Roland Garros apprenticeship.A final versus Rafael Nadal, the nine-time French Open champion who turned 30 on Friday, would have been more symbolic, but Nadal is out with a wrist injury.Murray, long at his best on faster surfaces, is the only man other than Roger Federer to have beaten Djokovic more than once in the past two seasons. He also has matured into a true clay-court player and has won 11 straight matches on the surface, including a victory over Djokovic in the Rome final last month.Murray has already made tennis history of his own in this waterlogged tournament, becoming the first British man since Bunny Austin in 1937 to reach the singles final at Roland Garros.Murray got there with one of his finer performances: a 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 semifinal victory over Stan Wawrinka, the No. 3 seed and defending champion.Murray, who was pushed to five sets in the first round and second round, said he needed time to adjust to the slower conditions in Paris this year, and he made the unusual decision to alter the string tension in his rackets to improve his feel.He was often masterful against Wawrinka, and he will need much more of the same Sunday if he is to keep Djokovics story arc at bay.I was really impressed today; its the best Ive seen Andy play on clay, said Paul Annacone, Federers former coach and a Tennis Channel analyst. I think Andy has the variation that can cause problems for Novak, and we saw it a little bit in Rome. Andy can attack Novaks second serve. Andy can use low, short slices to bring Novak forward. Andy can go strong down the line with his two-handed backhand. Those are a few things that are really important to be able to do against Novak, because nobody has ever defended the baseline better than him.For me, its the balance of how well Andy protects his own second serve and how well he creates imbalance in the rallies for Novak early in the match. If they play straightforward percentage tennis, two-hander to two-hander, crosscourt forehand to crosscourt forehand, Novak will win that match nine and a half times out of 10 over best-of-five sets.Murrays ability to take well-calculated risks and go for more than usual with his forehand should also be critical. He did that well in Rome, and he pushed Djokovic hard at the French Open last year before losing in the fifth set of a semifinal contested over two days. It was left to Wawrinka to stop Djokovic short of the only Grand Slam title he lacks, ambushing him with a free-swinging performance in the final.The French Open remains Djokovics stumbling block. He lost to Nadal in the 2012 and 2014 finals and has lost four times in the semifinals. He now ranks fourth on the mens list for career victories at Roland Garros with 54. Nobody else in that elite group has failed to win the title.Will it be an injustice if he never does it?We can talk about that in five years, said Boris Becker, one of Djokovics coaches. At the moment, we are intent on winning a few.Djokovic is not only trying to join the elite club of seven men who have won all four Grand Slam singles titles. He is also trying to complete a so-called Djoker Slam by winning his fourth major in a row.But Murray is a hungry 29-year-old, too. This will be the first time the No. 1 and No. 2 men will meet in the final of a Grand Slam tournament that neither has won since the 1984 French Open, when Ivan Lendl rallied to beat John McEnroe.There is a lot riding on the match for both of us, Murray said. We have had some really big battles in the Slams before on all the other surfaces. Im sure it will be the same again on Sunday.Djokovic leads, 4-2, in their Grand Slam finals and beat Murray to win the Australian Open in January. He dominates their overall head-to-head matches, having won 23 of their 33. But Murray  muttering to himself, shouting at himself, pushing himself  has managed to recreate something closer to a rivalry of late by winning two of the past six.He is a curmudgeonly perfectionist in a sport where perfection is unattainable. But he clearly cannot waste too much nervous or negative energy on things other than dealing with Djokovic.Keeping his composure gives Andy his best chance, but he is so passionate and emotionally driven that he cant be a total stoic, Annacone said. So he has to figure out how to manage it so its not a 15-minute running dialogue.Murrays 6-3, 6-3 victory in Rome came in a best-of-three-set format, not the best-of-five format in which Djokovic is at his elastic, rally-extending best. It also came with Djokovic weary in mind and body after a grueling week of back-to-back matches against the likes of Nadal and Kei Nishikori.Djokovic could be excused for feeling the same way in Paris after having to play for four straight days because of rain delays. But he did not have to compete for particularly long on any of those days. Nor has he been worn out by heat (it has been sweater and scarf weather in Paris), and he has long since proved that he is as good at recovering as he is at counterpunching.Thiem, seven years younger than Djokovic at age 22, had no answers. Djokovic was irresistible from the start, expertly mixing drop shots and forays to the net, returning and defending with trademark efficiency and making unforced errors very rarely. Thiem felt obliged to take big risk after big risk. Too few of them paid off.Seeded 13th, Thiem will break into the top 10 next week, at No. 7. But prime Djokovic remains a cut above. There are no weaknesses to exploit: He was even making overheads Friday in front of an enthusiastic crowd on Suzanne Lenglen Court, which was filled with Serbian banners and French fans happy to get such a bargain.With this weeks rain forcing French Open organizers to play the womens and mens semifinals on Friday, Djokovic and Thiem were bumped to Lenglen, the tournaments second-largest show court, with Murray and Wawrinka on center stage on Philippe Chatrier Court.Fans with grounds passes  some purchased at only 10 euros  thus got the rare opportunity to see the reigning No. 1, who could very soon be a French Open champion, too."}
{"text": "And God said, Let there be emojis.Well, not really. But the less-internet savvy among us may be forgiven for that interpretation thanks to a new translation of the Bible that has rendered the Christian scriptures in emojis and other forms of online slang.The book, Bible Emoji: Scripture 4 Millenials, is based on a Twitter feed that has been posting emojified Bible verses for almost a year. (The author intentionally misspelled millennial, he said, to thumb his nose at critics who might dismiss the project as the work of the young and foolish.)In its internet-friendly form, this is how the Bible (and the universe) begins.The book was released Sunday on iBooks, the online Apple bookstore. It contains more than 3,000 pages of smiling yellow faces, twinkling stars and cartoon serpents. Angel emojis descend from the heavens, bush emojis burn and ocean emojis are parted.All 66 glorious books, said the author, a self-described techie who requested anonymity because some critics have accused the project of being part of the satanic illuminati agenda and the ushering in of the Antichrist.The Bible is the most translated book in the world, so it was probably only a matter of time before the new online vernacular got its turn. But, some may ask, why take the time to translate the New and Old Testaments into emoji form?The author said the project began as a fun experiment with an online text translator and the King James version.You know one of those things where you can create Yoda-speak? he said in a telephone interview. I just started playing around with the translator, and I thought it might be kind of fun to use emojis, then I thought it would be fun to do the Bible and see how it would come out.The decision to start tweeting out the results, beginning with the book of Genesis, came naturally. He also started a website where users can generate emoji translations of their own.It was like a public proofread, he said. And the internet has responded well to the tweets, which have avoided the the more violent and negative things in the Bible, he said.The Twitter feed contains few smitings or stonings and no mention of the book of Leviticus, which many interpret as condemning homosexuality. (Those passages do appear in the complete book, however.)I try to tweet out some of the more fun ones, he said.Some parents have even written in to say the more slang-filled, visual version of the Good Book has helped their children read it, especially those with learning disabilities, the author said.But not everyone has been pleased. Besides the illuminati conspiracy theorists and the snarky swamp-dwellers of internet comment sections (some people are really crazy, the author said), some online commenters have criticized the project for either mocking religion or manipulating it in a cynical attempt to convert the young.Part of the authors desire for anonymity, he said, is to make it harder for people to project an agenda onto it.People who want me to be a Christian zealot say, Its crazy right-wing Christians desperate to reach millennials, and people who hate it think I am part of a leftist agenda to dumb down society and turn religion into a joke, the author said.Neither is true, he said. You dont translate thousands of pages of Scripture into smiley faces and slang if you think religion is a joke, he added.I grew up very religious, and as a child I actually read the entire Bible, which I dont think many people can say they have done, the author said.And no part of the Bible has been rewritten, only condensed and emojified, he said, so the word and becomes & and the word light becomes a light bulb.If anything, the author said he wants people to read the Bible for themselves  whether in emoji or not  and draw their own conclusions.I dont think many people do a good job of understanding the Bible in context, he said.And he thinks emojis can help with that.What makes emojis so great and part of the symbolism I wanted with this project is that emojis are universal in the strictest sense, the author said. Emojis have no gender, no race and no agenda."}

{"text": "VIENNA  The new oil minister in Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the OPEC countries, had a message for the global market: Dont expect us to influence the price of crude oil by adjusting supplies.I think managing in the traditional way that we tried in the past may never come again, the minister, Khalid al-Falih, said on Thursday. Certainly we will not go with certain price targets.The message  which came after the decision on Thursday by the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain high levels of oil production  is central to the changing strategy of the Saudi crude-oil complex. And it could foreshadow a period of volatility for oil prices because OPECs policies and the Saudis sway have long helped guide the markets.In a sweeping directive in April, Saudi Arabia set forth  plans to diversify its economy, reduce its dependence on oil and pull back on its government handouts. And what Mr. Falih does with Saudi Arabias oil  how much the kingdom decides to pump and where the money goes  is the biggest piece of the puzzle.The global markets received a sneak peak at Thursdays OPEC meeting, Mr. Falihs first since his appointment last month as the head of an expanded energy, industry and mining ministry.While other OPEC members have been urging the freezing or lowering of oil production, Mr. Falih is pushing to keep it high and plow the money into other industries that might prove profitable for Saudi Arabia. He wants the cartel to rethink its longstanding approach and assumptions that it can manage global oil supplies and prices.It runs counter to the longtime stance of his predecessor, Ali al-Naimi, who presided over an era when OPEC was largely content to restrain production to try to drive prices up.The Saudis shift is easier to justify because price pressures have abated of late. While oil initially dipped on Thursday, it recovered to around $50 a barrel, about twice what it was in January.Oil producers should let the market forces continue to seek and find that equilibrium price between supply and demand, said Mr. Falih, speaking to a small group of reporters in his penthouse hotel suite.The Saudis can increasingly afford to go their own way. Along with a wealth of oil reserves, Saudi Arabia invested tens of billions of dollars in building a competitive oil business at a time when other OPEC countries like Venezuela and Iran allowed their industries to deteriorate.Mr. Falih has been at the core of those moves.Mr. Falih a 1982 graduate of Texas A&M, jumped onto the international oil scene in the early 2000s. Hoping to inject life and competition into the economy, King Abdullah, Saudi Arabias ruler at the time, invited overseas companies to look for natural gas after shutting them out in the 1970s.To the surprise of Western oil executives, the king tapped Mr. Falih, then a young executive at Saudi Aramco, to manage complex negotiations for a series of joint ventures with Royal Dutch Shell of Britain, Total of France and Lukoil of Russia. Although the ventures didnt find much gas, Mr. Falih garnered credit for deftly juggling conflicting interests.After a year or so, I had to accept that he was really good at what he was doing, said Floris Ansingh, who was the head of Shell in Saudi Arabia at the time. He understood the different trade-offs.Mr. Falihs international focus set the stage for the evolution of Saudi Aramco.After he was named chief executive of the company in 2009, he pushed for modernization, trying to turn the state-run oil company into a global competitor that rivaled the private giants in the West. He expanded areas like oil trading and acquisitions and tried to lock up demand by investing in China and in other growing economies.Saudi Aramco has recently developed three giant oil fields, sharply increasing the amount of oil it can produce. The company earned an estimated $200 billion from oil production last year, according to the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie.The view in the industry is that Aramco is one of the best oil companies in the world, said J. Robinson West, a senior adviser on energy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization. Khalid has been important in building that.Mr. Falih also seems unafraid to tread on sensitive ground.As the head of the national oil company, he warned that fast-rising domestic fuel consumption risked eroding the crude-oil exports that are the kingdoms main source of cash.We need to make sure that we use our precious oil and gas resources efficiently, wisely and minimizing waste, Mr. Falih said at a dinner in 2010.At the time, rethinking the countrys energy use at home was a politically fraught issue. Government subsidies that kept fuel cheap were considered an untouchable piece of the Saudi social contract. And with oil prices surging back then, the kingdoms oil wealth, it seemed, would only grow.Now, his warning is part of the new Saudi mind-set.He is a very astute political player, said Valrie Marcel, author of Oil Titans, a book about national oil companies. He has been able to push back and create space to debate issues, while still keeping himself in good position with the ruler.Mr. Falih also recognized early on that growing concern for the climate could reduce demand for Saudi oil, creating a risk that a large portion of those resources might be left in the ground.On Thursday, Mr. Falih said that Saudi Arabia was now preparing for the worst case by moving aggressively to spur growth of nonoil-based industries. While he said he thought that demand for crude would last for generations, Mr. Falih added that we as human beings cannot be complacent and assume that oil will continue to fuel the world forever.In recent years, Mr. Falih has taken on the role of trusted confidant, serving as adviser and troubleshooter for Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In 2015, the prince put Mr. Falih in charge of the kingdoms troubled Health Ministry, which was struggling to contain a deadly respiratory virus called MERS.In his new role, Mr. Falih has significant oversight of a huge portion of the Saudi economy. The Oil Ministry absorbed the Ministry of Electricity and was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. He has also been appointed head of the government-owned mining company, a state-run industrial fund, the geological survey, the atomic and renewable energy program and a number of other state-run economic bodies.Mr. Falih faces a huge set of objectives, some in areas where his predecessor came up short. Despite its oil wealth, the kingdom struggles to produce sufficient natural gas to meet the fast-growing needs of electricity generators and industry. Efforts to develop solar power and other renewable energy sources have also lagged some of Saudi Arabias neighbors, like the United Arab Emirates.Mr. Falih is part of the plan to refocus the countrys financial firepower to invest in areas other than oil. In a sign of the shifting strategy, the kingdom, traditionally conservative in its investment approach, recently invested $3.5 billion in the ride-sharing start-up Uber. It was one of the largest investments into a privately held start-up.Mr. Falih is also in charge of the effort to sell a small stake in Saudi Aramco to investors with a target of 2018. He said the idea was to make the company more global as it looks to add investments in natural gas.A public listing might also improve the companys performance.If you have to face the analysts every quarter, he said, it gives you a bit of competitive tension.To make it all work, Mr. Falih will have to persuade the countrys stubborn constituents to adopt a more commercial focus and to participate in joint ventures with international companies. While some doubt whether Mr. Falih is the right person to lead this transition, others say only an insider has the credibility to do so.Either way, the oil market will be watching."}
{"text": "He played the role of press analyst and critic, offering clipped replies and a knowing smirk in response to questions about politics, motivation and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.For a combative but contained 17 minutes, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday offered terse answers to an abundance of questions from reporters, mostly dealing with the fallout from overlapping federal and state investigations into his administration, in a performance that in recent weeks has become a kind of house style for his embattled mayoralty.Seated at a blue table, the mayor restated the mantra that his administration would eventually be found to have done everything appropriately. He laid out dots but no names  referring to a particular reporter at one point, a state official with a particular employment history at another  and asked reporters to connect them, arguing by insinuation that they would lead back to Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat.A lot of good questions to follow up on there, Mr. de Blasio said, suggesting as he has for weeks that an investigatory report from the State Board of Elections highly critical of his fund-raising on behalf of Democrats in the State Senate had been leaked by those close to the governor to damage him.The back and forth, at the tail end of an hourlong news conference on crime statistics at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, came on the second day of an increasingly open war of words between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, whose deepening feud has shown little sign of being repaired.On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo told reporters that the mayor was wrong about the origin of the leak, which the state inspector general found to have come from a Republican spokesman for the bipartisan election board. (The governor had previously said the leak might have come from Republicans on the board.)He, in my opinion, falsely and recklessly accused public servants who are just doing their job of being unprofessional, Mr. Cuomo said. I think he should apologize.So, the mayor was asked the next day, would he apologize? No, Mr. de Blasio said, shaking his head. Later, he reiterated, Not going to happen.Mr. de Blasio instead appeared to stick with the story of a state investigatory apparatus aimed unfairly at him, complaining of a double standard as he had in previous news conferences, and observing that party affiliation may not preclude the hand of the governor in the leak.The lines between Democrats and Republicans often blur in Albany, Mr. de Blasio said.Over the past two days, both men also took their swipes when asked about supporting the other for re-election.Im not a city resident, Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday.Im focused on 2016, Mr. de Blasio replied on Thursday when asked about endorsing the governor.Flanked by top police officials, Mr. de Blasio spoke as much through facial expressions that, at times, revealed his frustration: a pinched smile, a smirk, the movement of his eyes upward to the ceiling as he batted back questions.As Mr. de Blasio spoke, two top aides to the governor posted their own thoughts on Twitter, seemingly emboldened by the inspector generals report and Mr. Cuomos words a day before to attack the mayor more directly.Im sure saying I was wrong is one of the hardest things to do in politics, but continuing this charade at this point is just silly, wrote Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor. Deflect is a lesser known river in Egypt as well, he said in another post.Melissa DeRosa, the governors chief of staff, mocked whatever planet that presser was held on and observed that the last time Mayor demand facts be brought to light, they were, he was wrong, and his lawyer went so far as to threaten a personal lawsuit.But for all the political tumult, Mr. de Blasio appeared more at ease on Thursday than in recent news conferences, emphasizing at several points how he and his team were very comfortable that the inquiries would reveal no wrongdoing. The truth is a very comforting thing, he said, and were comfortable with the truth.As if to underscore that point, Mr. de Blasio remained seated at the blue tables  with paper nameplates in front of each official  that in recent weeks have become a hallmark of his news conferences. The blue tables have appeared at police events and at those related to housing; uptown in Washington Heights and downtown at City Hall.These are long, long proceedings, he said when asked about the tables. It just makes more sense to sit down.Another New York politician also, at times, favors the sit-behind-a-table approach: Mr. Cuomo."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  When word circulated in Washington this week that Bouthaina Shaaban, who is a top adviser to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and who has been under sanction by the United States government, would appear two blocks from the White House at an antiterrorism news conference, the Obama administration reacted with alarm.John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, called Dr. Shaaban a propaganda mouthpiece of the Assad government, which President Obama has said must go, and the Treasury noted that any transaction with a person designated on one of its blacklists was prohibited.Dr. Shaaban did not arrive in person on Thursday, but she did appear via Skype video at the National Press Club, where she delivered a 20-minute speech followed by an extraordinary and at times contentious one-hour question-and-answer session with journalists and others.Seated at a desk with a Syrian flag behind her and one pinned to the lapel of her blazer, Dr. Shaaban defended her government defiantly, assailed the Obama administration as being insufficiently committed to defeating the Islamic State and blamed Western news media for perpetuating what she called a false narrative about Syria and Mr. Assads government.We would love American officials to say the truth to their people and to the world about whats happening in our country, because covering the truth is costing us blood, Dr. Shaaban told an audience of several dozen in a nondescript meeting room at the National Press Club, where her image appeared on two large digital screens.The question is, why does the United States refuse to cooperate with Russia in fighting terrorism in Syria?Dr. Shaabans presentation was a direct challenge to the approach the Obama administration has taken in Syria, where the United States has worked to empower rebel groups and shepherd international peace talks aimed at bringing about a political transition there and an end to hostilities.Theres no such thing as moderate opposition in Syria, Dr. Shaaban said, denouncing the anti-government groups as a terrorist movement.She flatly rejected a proposal by the main opposition organization to establish a nationwide truce during the holiday of Ramadan.The opposition does not want to go to negotiate during Ramadan because they are all Islamists, Dr. Shaaban said.She deflected many of the criticisms Mr. Obama and top American officials have made of the Syrian government, including accusations by Secretary of State John Kerry that Mr. Assad has a symbiotic financial relationship with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Theres no question that the Syrian government never buys oil or sells oil to the terrorists, Dr. Shaaban said.And she repeatedly sidestepped questions about reports that the Syrian government has blocked humanitarian food and other aid to many thousands of desperate civilians, including in a Damascus suburb, Daraya, that has been blockaded since 2012.Daraya is the food basket of Damascus; theres nobody starving in Daraya, Dr. Shaaban said at one point, adding that Syrians are accustomed to eating fresh fruits and vegetables and would weep at the prospect of consuming canned food and macaroni sent by aid agencies. The Syrian people are able to feed themselves.She bristled at questions about acts her government or close associates are suspected of committing, including the use of barrel bombs to kill civilians.I dont want to give up on the idea of a free press, but you are forcing me to do so, because Im amazed at how the questions are coming from completely distorted perspective, she said.The event nearly devolved into chaos after a reporter asked about Dr. Shaabans association with a former Lebanese information minister, Michel Samaha, who is suspected of being part of a conspiracy to kill Lebanese political and religious leaders.I wish you could be constructive, Dr. Shaaban said. All that you are bringing is something that you think is embarrassing to me, but nothing is embarrassing to me.You kill innocent people! a person who was not identified shouted as the room erupted in jeers and a moderator called for security. The person was not detained.The gathering was hosted by a nonprofit group calling itself the Global Alliance for Terminating Al Qaeda/ISIS, or Gafta, founded by Ahmad Maki Kubba, an Iraqi-American who is pressing the Obama administration to ally with the Assad government to defeat the Islamic State.Mr. Kubba compared such a partnership to the cooperation between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Josef Stalin to defeat Hitler.We do not have Stalin, but we have worse than Hitler: ISIS and Al Qaeda, he said on Thursday. If Assad goes, whos going to take over? ISIS and Al Qaeda.Also attending the event was Bassam al-Hussaini, the Iraqi governments liaison to the Iraqi militias, many of which are backed by Iran.These are not Shia militia, Mr. Hussaini said. These are Iraqis fighting to free the cities of Iraq.Dr. Shaaban, blacklisted by the Treasury in 2011, said her decision to appear remotely in Washington had nothing to do with the sanctions, but that a visit to the United States in 2005, when one of her aides had been detained for two hours without explanation, had soured her on returning.Since that time, I decided that I do not want to visit the United States, although I have received many invitations, she said. I have an integrity, and I am not ready to be humiliated in any airport."}
{"text": "Soccer will experiment with video replay in league and cup competitions in six countries this year, FIFA and the body that governs the rules of the game announced on Thursday, with the intention of approving full use of the technology in matches over the next year.The leagues and organizations approved this year for experimentation with the replay system, known as video assistant referee, include Major League Soccer in the United States, the Bundesliga in Germany and the A-League in Australia, as well as selected competitions in Brazil, Portugal and the Netherlands, according to FIFA and the rule-making body, the International Football Association Board.Video assistant referee will be used only in match-changing situations: goals, penalty decisions, direct red cards and cases of mistaken identity in which a referee cautions or sends off the wrong player. Routine fouls would not be subject to review, and the system would supplement existing goal-line technology.For now, the testing will be done as a series of shadow experiments to evaluate equipment and procedures without the participation of match officials or communication with them. In its current form, a referee on the field or a video assistant watching elsewhere can request or suggest a review of a potentially incorrect decision. Video of the play would then be reviewed during a brief stoppage in play, and the referee would make a final decision. (Because most situations defined by the rule-making association as match-changing  goals, fouls and expulsions  are accompanied by brief stoppages, the hope is that the flow of matches will not be affected.)The association said it was permitting online and live testing in several countries to get more data before approving video assistant referee worldwide. It will conduct live testing in December at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan with the intention of approving more live use of the technology in 2017. Full testing and approval is not expected to be completed until at least 2018.While the introduction of technology in soccer still has many opponents  the widespread use of goal-line technology took years to approve despite several major disputes over calls  M.L.S. has been a leading advocate for it in recent years, and the league said that it had conducted testing with video assistant referee since 2014. The M.L.S. experiments, and others in various leagues, helped persuade the association that in-game mistakes on important decisions could be corrected without interrupting the flow of the game.We believe the time has come for a mechanism that helps referees avoid clearly incorrect decisions that change the game, M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement.M.L.S. said it would conduct its tests at United Soccer League matches at M.L.S. sites this summer, with the intention of trying it at M.L.S. games in the future. Other countries could soon be added to the list.There are others that are very interested but need to hold further consultations with their key stakeholders and with different technology providers, said Lukas Brud, the International Football Association Boards secretary. They still have time, and we expect to be able to officially confirm additional participants in the coming months."}
{"text": "Americas relationship with India has blossomed under President Obama, who will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week. Ideally, Mr. Obama could take advantage of the ties he has built and press for India to adhere to the standards on nuclear proliferation to which other nuclear weapons states adhere.The problem, however, is that the relationship with India rests on a dangerous bargain. For years, the United States has sought to bend the rules for Indias nuclear program to maintain Indias cooperation on trade and to counter Chinas growing influence. In 2008, President George W. Bush signed a civilian nuclear deal with India that allowed it to trade in nuclear materials. This has encouraged Pakistan to keep expanding a nuclear weapons program that is already the fastest growing in the world.Now, India has Mr. Obamas strong support in its bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a 48-nation body that governs trade in nuclear-related exports and aims to ensure that civilian trade in nuclear materials is not diverted for military uses. Membership would enhance Indias standing as a nuclear weapons state, but it is not merited until the country meets the groups standards.All group members have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, either as nuclear weapons states (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China) or as non-nuclear weapons states (everybody else). India has refused, which means it has not accepted legally binding commitments to pursue disarmament negotiations, halt the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and not test nuclear weapons.President Bush squandered an opportunity to demand more of India when he signed the 2008  deal, which opened the door to American trade in nuclear technology for civilian energy, something India had insisted was a prerequisite to more cooperation and lucrative business deals.As part of the 2008 deal, the Indians promised they would be ready to assume the same responsibilities and practices as other nations with advanced nuclear technology. But they have fallen far short by continuing to produce fissile material and to expand their nuclear arsenal.The Nuclear Suppliers Group is to discuss Indias application later this month. Mr. Obama is lobbying for India to win membership through a special exception. If he succeeds, India would be in a position to keep Pakistan, which has also applied for membership, from gaining membership because group decisions must be unanimous. That could give Pakistan, which at one time provided nuclear technology to North Korea and Iran, new incentives to misbehave.Opposition from China, which is close to Pakistan and views India as a rival, could doom Indias bid for now. But the issue will not go away. India is growing in importance and seeking greater integration into organizations that govern international affairs. If it wants recognition as a nuclear weapons state, it should be required to meet the nuclear groups standards, including opening negotiations with Pakistan and China on curbing nuclear weapons and halting the production of nuclear fuel for bombs."}
{"text": "The government reported on Friday that employers added just 38,000 workers to their payrolls in May, a sharp slowdown in hiring that is expected to push back a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.The latest snapshot suggested that the economic recovery might have stalled this spring, at least temporarily.Despite the anemic job gains, the official unemployment rate, (which is based on a separate survey of households), fell to 4.7 percent, its lowest point in nearly a decade. But the decline was primarily a result of Americans dropping out of the labor force rather than finding new jobs.Boy, this is ugly, said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. The losses were deeper and more broad-based than we expected, and with the downward revision to previous months, it puts the Fed back on pause.The only good news is that wages held, Ms. Swonk said. Average hourly earnings rose again, 0.2 percent for the month, for a gain of 2.5 percent for the last 12 months, an encouraging sign that many more working Americans are finally beginning to enjoy some benefits from a tighter labor market.In close presidential races, the economys direction in the months leading to the November election has often played an important role in influencing voters, with credit or blame going to the party that occupies the White House. This is hardly a typical presidential race, though, and Fridays report is only one indicator of the economy.Still, after revving up over the last two years, the nations job engine appears to have sputtered, with the Labor Department shrinking its initial estimates of March and Aprils employment totals by 59,000. The average monthly gain for the last three months was 116,000 jobs.While subject to further revision as well, Mays figures were the lowest monthly growth since September 2010.The weakness in last months job totals was somewhat exaggerated because the estimate reflected the Labor Department classification of more than 35,000 striking Verizon workers as unemployed. With those people now back on the job, the missing strikers should be added back in the June report.Even apart from that distortion, the average monthly job gains so far in 2016 have fallen far shy of the nearly 240,000 average of the last two years, a pace that has helped buoy the economy and cut the jobless figure in half since the depths of the recession.Given the uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve is now likely to put off any decision to raise interest rates at its next meeting in mid-June and probably avoid lifting rates at its July meeting as well.Lael Brainard, a Fed governor and an ally of the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, described the May report as sobering in a speech on Friday afternoon.Ms. Brainard said the weak job growth was a reminder that the strength of the recovery should not be taken for granted, and she said she did not see clear evidence the economy had rebounded from a weak winter.Recent economic developments have been mixed, and important downside risks remain, Ms. Brainard, who has pushed for the Fed to move slowly in raising interest rates, said at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. In this environment, prudent risk management implies there is a benefit to waiting for additional data.After the Friday report, investors wrote off the chances of a June rate increase. The probability, as suggested by asset prices, fell to 6 percent from 21 percent in early trading, according to the CME Group. The probability of a rate rise by September fell from about two-thirds, but it remained about 50/50 either way.With the summer stretching ahead, the sentiment on Wall Street could perhaps be best summed up by the Tempos 1959 hit, See You in September.Unless there are further signs of fresh economic weakness, however, most economists expect at least one rate increase before the end of the year. The unemployment rate, which the Fed regards as an important indicator, has finally dropped to where it was before the recession began in late 2007. And first-time claims for unemployment insurance have remained at low levels not seen since the 1970s.On the other side of the ledger, the labor force participation rate declined for the second consecutive month, to 62.6 percent, and the number of people working part time for economic reasons rose sharply.Apart from the jobs figures, there are several encouraging economic signs, including a surge in home construction and hardy consumer spending. Most analysts expect the pace of economic growth to pick up to about 2.5 percent over the next three months from the first quarters 0.8 percent.To be clear, there is no evidence the economy is slowing into recession, said Steve Blitz, chief economist of M Science, a research firm.Voters perceptions of the economy are often a driving force in presidential elections. Its always good to be the party in power when the economic cycle is turning up in an election, said Mark J. Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. Its never advantageous when there is a downturn close to the election.This time around, though, history may not be the best guide, Thomas E. Mann, a resident scholar at Berkeleys Institute of Governmental Studies, warned: We should beware normalizing an abnormal election.Under these circumstances, he said, theres a good chance that the degree of a candidates personal unfavorability could be more important than the economy.As for the economys impact, Mr. Mann said changes in personal income, which are on the rise, tend to sway voters at the margins more than the jobless rate or the pace of job creation.Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has closely aligned herself with President Obamas economic policies and record-long streak of job gains. Worries about the economy are a more common refrain among supporters of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, as well as among those who are backing Senator Bernie Sanderss last-ditch bid to lead the Democratic ticket.Mr. Trump was quick to react on Twitter, writing Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, acknowledged that the jobs report was disappointing. But he said: The closer you get to the summit of full employment, the more trade-offs there will be between somewhat slower job growth and rising wages, and thats what were beginning to see here in this recovery.He, too, continues to be disturbed by the persistently low labor participation rate.Retiring baby boomers would be expected to bring down the proportion of the population in the labor market. But Patrick OKeefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, pointed to the significant decline among those in their prime working ages as well. Because so many discouraged job seekers have dropped out of the work force, he said, the relatively low official jobless rate is not capturing the true magnitude of the economys underlying weakness.In policy making, the Fed continues to focus on a measure that is maladjusted, Mr. OKeefe said.A broader measure of unemployment that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a part-time job because they cannot find a full-time one stayed steady at 9.7 percent.The heaviest job losses in May were in the construction, manufacturing and mining industries.Not everyone has seen a softening. Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago recruiter, said: In a weak economy, what usually gets cut first and usually gets put on hold first are jobs at the manager to director level  those earning between $75,000 and $125,000  and I havent seen that yet. At the lower end of the pay scale, workers have been hungry for an increase in wages that is finally starting to materialize as employers find it harder to fill jobs. Minimum-wage increases that have already taken effect in some places may be partly responsible for the uptick in average hourly earnings.Payroll growth was disappointing, said Jeremy Schwartz, an associate in global strategy and economics at Credit Suisse, but it was also consistent with a tightening labor market. As he advised in an alert: Dont panic."}
{"text": "VARIETY PUZZLE  The nice thing about Puns and Anagrams puzzles is that there is very little room for false advertising. Youre either going to find a pun or an anagram in the clues. Theyre dependable and comfy, like a pair of slippers.They also happen to be a good break from the daily crossword puzzles, because they ask you to think differently. I was lousy at anagrams until I started to solve PandAs on a regular basis. Now Im only fairly mediocre at them, but thats progress as far as Im concerned.The key is knowing how to recognize the recipe for them, and hoping that the PandA answers are relatively simple words or phrases. Today, for the first time that I can recall, I was stumped by a couple of entries because I was not aware of the words. Typically, if the answer is an anagram, I can figure out the answer by recognizing the synonym at either the beginning or the end of the clue. But if Ive never heard of EREMITE or CURLEWS, things get tough. You only know that youve arrived at the right answer if you can successfully solve the crossings. (Thats partly what makes a PandA easier than a cryptic crossword. A PandA has that all-over interlock, so you can make guesses at an entry you dont know.) Or if youre a hermit who likes birds.Anyway, lets take a look at a few of the puns or clues that require you to play with the words: 13As Part of Canada in favor of Coach Lombardi has Part of Canada as its synonym for province and the answer is, indeed PROVINCE or PRO-VINCE because it is in favor of Coach Vince Lombardi. 19As igh places drop the H in a enry iggins manner, and the answer is ILLS. 27Ds Swhere you sit for a sermon is a SPEW, or a PEW with an S at the beginning, as indicated in the clue. 4Ds Kind of cure is not an SAT question from your nightmares. The answer is SINE, but if you put SINE in front of cure (making it a kind of cure), you get the word SINECURE. I didnt know what that meant either, but  say it with me  now I know. 41Ds ELVERS Presley (slippery pop idol) was practically a gimme as long as you know obscure words for a type of eel.Thats enough to get you started.

{"text": "DUBLIN, Ohio  Jason Days long and winding road to the world No. 1 ranking began with him circumventing the short-game practice area at his boarding school in Australia. Defying the orders of his instructor, Colin Swatton, Day chose to play a par-3 course over working on his chipping and putting, leading to a loud row with Swatton that Day paved over with a public apology.Lesson learned. Fifteen years later, Day possesses one of the best short games in mens golf. He earned the distinction by embracing the unsexy truth that club manufacturers prefer to hide behind the massive heads of their high-priced drivers: a 30-yard or 30-foot shot counts the same on the scorecard as a 300-yard drive.The weekend golfers love the long game, because as Days countryman Geoff Ogilvy pointed out, They think theyre practicing to have nice scores, but theyre really only practicing to have fun.The superstitious touring pros love the long game in part because they dont want to invite calamity, however subliminally, by practicing difficult chips or awkward bunker shots. Youre hoping that youre not going to have those shots, Ogilvy said. You practice them when you get them.Day, a three-time winner this season, is known for his length. He averaged 318 yards off the tee in the first two rounds of the Memorial Tournament, but he credited his short game with keeping him within range of the leaders (he was tied for first in the field in sand saves through 36 holes). If the driver is his show-off club, his wedges and putters are his scoring clubs.I enjoy hitting drivers because I can just get out there and hit it as hard as I can, and youre on the driving range, its going to go semi-straight, Day said. Some of his short-game sessions, he added, have ended with him walking away kind of pulling my hair out and feeling as if his No. 1 ranking is a mirage. Like, yeah, Im the best player in the world, he said, scoffing.Day no longer requires prodding from Swatton, with whom he still works, to spend time on his short game. He said he would typically spend four and a half hours practicing chips, sand shots, putts and approaches inside 150 yards and two hours hitting his long irons and woods.If he gratifies his ego by smashing balls with his driver, Day has gotten better by putting in the work around the greens. Day said his short-game practice could be the opposite of fun.The hard thing about trying to improve something like that when it is one of your weaknesses is to actually get up and do it, because it really sucks trying to work on weaknesses at the start, he said. But as you slowly do it over time, it gets better and better and better, and then becomes a lot more exciting.Jordan Spieth, the world No. 2, clinched his eighth PGA Tour victory last week in Fort Worth with a holed chip for birdie on the penultimate hole of the tournament. It was Spieths ninth holed shot in 12 tour starts this season, and his reaction was intoxicating, a fizzy cocktail of surprise and satisfaction. Or, as Spieth described it, I think it was like a bit of shock, and then I think after that it was just a lot of happiness.According to numbers compiled by his caddie, Michael Greller, Spieth has had 10 hole-outs from off the green in his last 15 worldwide starts. Greller and Spieth have borrowed a betting game they picked up from Day and Swatton during the 2013 FedEx Cup playoffs. Greller sets a standard for hole-outs  this season it is 20, matching Spieths total last season  and if Spieth exceeds that number (hole-outs in a major tournament are worth double), Greller will treat Spieth to dinner. If not, Spieth will buy.You dont have to twist our arms for us to nitpick a small wager with each other, Spieth said.In the first round in Fort Worth, John Huh holed a 7-iron shot from 200 yards for an eagle on a par-4. It was his tour-leading 15th hole-out of the season. Really? Huh said Friday. I wasnt even aware of that stat.Huh added, If I wasnt that good in the short game, I wouldnt be here, but Im trying to improve it every year, every month, every week that Im playing on tour.Days caddie, Swatton, said he dreamed of the day when short-game statistics were highlighted like driving distances, thereby encouraging young players to work on their imaginations and not just their power. The long hitters know who they are (and so does the average golf fan). But what does it say about the value assigned to the short game by the golf industry that Huh didnt know he led all his peers in hole-outs?Swinging the driver as hard and fast as you can is probably the least nuanced part of the game, so that generally gets most of the attention from the recreational player, said Harry Arnett, the senior vice president of marketing and brand management for Callaway Golf. But all golfers come to the cold, hard realization that dedication to the complete game through the bag is the only sure way to lower their scores dramatically.Like other 3-year-olds, Days son, Dash, enjoys playing in the sand.

Mr. Croman was charged with 20 felonies related to his rental income (he has pleaded not guilty), and faces a civil suit accusing him of using illegal means to force tenants out of their rent-stabilized apartments, in order to renovate them and find new tenants to pay market rates.Unfortunately, Mr. Cromans alleged approach to emptying buildings is not at all uncommon. Altering or destroying a building in order to make it unsafe is the method of choice for many property owners operating in some of the citys most rapidly changing neighborhoods. When tenants can no longer cope with the danger, they often reach out to city agencies for help, which plays right into the property owners hand: A city inspector pays a visit, observes the hazards and issues an order to vacate. Tenants then have mere hours to leave their homes, and once they vacate an apartment it is nearly impossible for them to get back in.Even when housing court disputes are settled and a judge finds a property owner responsible for illegal construction, such decisions rarely involve criminal charges. Occasionally, city and state governments are able to work in concert to arrest a bad actor. But the number of bad actors far exceed the arrests. Brooklyn, which is undergoing an aggressive wave of gentrification, is rife with property owners who engage in these practices with impunity. Specific examples are easy to come by.In 2014, for instance, tenants of the seven-unit building at 94 Franklin Avenue, which is owned by the Tiferes Yehuda Family Trust, were told that construction would soon take place in the backyard. When tenants asked the building manager about it, she explained that a new playground was in the works. Soon construction workers showed up and threw away tenants belongings  toys, grills, patio furniture  without warning. Jackhammering began and was so severe that exterior windows shattered and dust seeped into tenants homes, affecting an asthmatic child living inside. The dust, noise and debris became part of daily life for the next year.In court affidavits, one tenant says that when she called the building manager about the situation, she denied that construction was taking place. And the work continued. A crew began putting up a wall just a few inches from the back of the building. The tenants called 311, and the Department of Buildings sent over an inspector. The work continued, and tenants called 311 again. When an inspector saw that the construction was eliminating egress and cutting off natural light, a stop work order and a vacate order were issued. The tenants were given hours to leave.That was July 2015. The work continued and five months later, in December, another stop work order was issued. Since evacuating nearly a year ago, the tenants have had limited access to their apartments and had to arrange visits through the manager. Inside, they discovered water damage, a rat infestation and rotting floors. In court documents, lawyers for the property owner say that the manager has since been replaced and that repairs have been made, and continue to be made, to lift the vacate order. The Department of Buildings has brought criminal actions against the owners and the city is seeking to appoint an administrator to the building. Meanwhile, all of the tenants are still displaced with no guarantees that they will be able to move back into their homes. One family has entered the shelter system.The case at 172 North Eighth Street, an eight-unit building in Williamsburg, is another example. In June 2009, tenants in the rent-stabilized apartments were ordered to vacate because of an illegal excavation of the basement by the buildings owner, listed publicly as 172 Realty Capital, that compromised the structural integrity of the building. The building had 76 open violations from the city, including 34 labeled immediately hazardous. Repairs were reportedly done and the order was lifted. Some tenants returned to find no running water, no electricity and no functioning sewage. Then, two cellar walls were found to have collapsed. Another vacate order was issued, forcing the tenants out yet again.After a year-and-a-half-long court battle to take the building away from the owner, the judge appointed an administrator to oversee the repairs needed to make the building livable again. The tenants finally moved back to their apartments in 2014. No criminal charges were brought against 172 Realty Capital. Its repeated attempts to regain control of the building have so far failed.Those who struggle to survive the war of attrition and stay in their homes often describe a sense of dread that remains with them  the anticipation of another knock on the door, whether from an antagonistic building manager or a city inspector delivering an order to vacate.One tenant, Tranquilina Alvillar, received that knock at the door in 2011. She lived in a rent-stabilized unit at 193 Bedford Avenue and paid $700 a month. She was ordered to vacate her apartment after the company that bought the building that year, Reno Capital, had offered her at least one large buyout  a one-time payment to forfeit the rights to the apartment  which she refused. As renovations began on the other apartments, the hallways filled with dust and equipment. It is no exaggeration to say that Ms. Alvillar was living in a construction site when the city ordered her to leave. She had been living there for 24 years.Over the next year, she filed several lawsuits to get her apartment back. While the cases played out, Reno Capital went ahead with renovations on Ms. Alvillars apartment and, upon completing the work, rented the place out for $2,900. After the vacate order was lifted in December 2012, she visited the building only to discover that a new tenant had moved into her apartment. Again, she sued the owner. Two years later, Ms. Alvillar won the case, and when she returned to her apartment she found a much smaller space than the one she was forced out of.That was in 2014. But even now she still fears another knock on her door, and with good reason: Reno Capital continues to assert that she is not the legal tenant of her apartment and is now trying to get the courts to reverse earlier decisions.In order to protect tenants from such situations, the city should change its approach to issuing vacate orders. If an order is issued because of illegal activity on the part of a property owner, the affected tenants should be given stable housing (at present the American Red Cross provides them with temporary housing) and representation through a nonprofit, housing-focused legal aid office.The bill for these two expenses, housing and lawyers, could be covered by steeper fines for property owners who provoke vacate orders. Such fines, along with a more aggressive pursuit of criminal charges for bad behavior and violations, would go a long way toward addressing this systemic behavior. Building owners might then think twice before taking a sledgehammer to their properties  and at least once about the people who in live in them."}

{"text": "Oakland, Calif.  MUHAMMAD ALI, who died Friday at the age of 74, was the greatest boxer of all time, but he was also deeply human, as full of frailty and foibles as anyone. He was physically vulnerable: Early on, doctors warned him and his camp followers that he was getting hit too much while training for his fights. He wouldnt listen, and no one around him tried to persuade him otherwise.Many would agree with the boxing trainer Emanuel Steward that Ali should have quit after his triumph over George Foreman in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), in 1974. Instead, he boxed for another seven years, and paid for it in the subsequent decades of physical and mental frailty. His trainer, Angelo Dundee, said that he was already suffering from brain damage when he fought his last two fights.It seemed like the more people watched Ali, the less they understood him. Many of the writers who worshiped him  those I call the Ali Scribes  cast him as a member of the 1960s counterculture for his 1967 refusal to serve in Vietnam. In fact, he was simply following the nonviolence policy of the Nation of Islam, which he had joined a few years earlier.Alis relationship with the Nation was always more complicated than the Ali Scribes realized, or wanted to admit. They saw him as a victim, saying that the Nation stole money from him. Unlike them, who dismiss Alis mentor and the head of the Nation, Elijah Muhammad, as a cult racketeer or worse, I actually interviewed some of the Nation members. They said that it was the other way around: According to Khalilah Ali, whose father was a captain in the Nation and whom I interviewed on a cold winter day in Chicago, the organization  and her father personally  gave him much more money than he gave in return. Some members of the Nation are still bitter.Even so, Ali was generous, more perhaps than was good for him. Howard Moore Jr., a lawyer and a frequent houseguest, said that Alis phone would ring all day. Callers were asking him to pay their rent or loan them money, and more often than not he did, no questions asked. According to the documentary The Don King Story, after Ali was nearly killed in the ring by Larry Holmes in 1980, Mr. King, the promoter of the fight, cheated him out of all but $50,000 of an $8 million purse (Mr. King denies the charge).Ali eschewed the promoters and agents who spoke for other boxers, but he had his own traveling circus of parasites and hangers on who encouraged him to fight, no matter the damage to his body. He took such a beating from Earnie Shavers in 1977 that Teddy Brenner, the matchmaker at Madison Square Garden, refused to book him to fight there again. After another fight, Ferdie Pacheco, a fight doctor, warned those who were close to Ali that he was urinating blood; he got no response.Ali sometimes fell in with the wrong crowd, including his friend Major Coxson, a politician and gangster in Cherry Hill, N.J., who was killed in a 1973 mob hit. One of his managers, Richard M. Hirschfeld, was a criminal who hanged himself in jail. Harold Smith, the one-time chairman of Muhammad Ali Professional Sports Inc., used the champions name to steal $21.3 million from Wells Fargo, one of the largest embezzlement cases in history.Alis career will make you cry. Long after he retired, he remained a symbol of rock-solid strength, but even during his career he was in decline. Here was this young, self-described pretty boxer who could dazzle you with his raps, who was always bubbling over with confidence. But his three years away from the ring, from 1967 to 1970, were damaging. The boxer Ron Lyle said that before Alis absence, you couldnt touch him  but after he returned to the ring it was easy enough.Ali was a pugilist, but also a poet  literally. The first time I saw him was in 1963, when he came to read his poetry at a cafe in New Yorks Greenwich Village called the Bitter End.The last time I saw him was in 2005, when I attended the opening of the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Ky. He looked drawn and weary. The loud mouth that rattled the nation had been shut. The Louisville Lip had been stitched.Was he in fact the greatest boxer of all time? Some say that Joe Louis was greater. Louis in turn called Sonny Liston the greatest heavyweight champion in history. And indeed, Liston busted a whole bunch of people on the way up, and a whole bunch on the way down.But then I think of a story that one of Alis friends and former managers, Gene Kilroy, once told me. A child was dying of cancer. Ali visited the hospital and told the boy that he was going to defeat Sonny Liston and that he, the kid, was going to defeat cancer. No, the boy said. Im going to God, and Im going to tell God that I know you."}
{"text": "To the Editor:I read with interest David Brookss column on campus radicalism, which focused on my college, Oberlin, while defining a larger national challenge (Inside Student Radicalism, May 27).As Mr. Brooks points out, many in our country are frustrated by what they perceive as inattention or neglect. This is perhaps most evident in our national political discourse, but certainly also pronounced in campus microcosms across the country.What we at educational institutions must do is twofold: listen and respond to the real concerns, while educating our students and maintaining our academic standards. In these discussions with students, faculty, staff and our boards, we must be willing to insist on our principles and our core mission while we work to improve our institutions during what is undeniably a period of significant national change.This process may at times be messy, and at times will necessitate disagreement. But by engaging in this dialogue, we not only strengthen our educational institutions, but also create a model that may strengthen our democracy, our civic discourse and our country. I am proud to lead an institution that has been at the forefront of this critical work since 1833.MARVIN KRISLOVPresident, Oberlin CollegeOberlin, OhioTo the Editor:I was disturbed by Nathan Hellers article in The New Yorker addressed by David Brooks. I graduated 41 years ago from Oberlin, where I was lucky to meet the woman who is now my wife.The student who told Mr. Heller that she was going home to Chicago to be exactly who I was before I came to Oberlin mystifies me. Oberlin changed me profoundly. I found out how little I actually knew about the world, and it unleashed a hunger to learn that has never dissipated.I do my best to sympathize with those who suffer from identity politics even though I may not comprehend the basis of their pain. On the other hand, Amartya Sen, in his excellent book on identity politics, Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny, made the point that all of us maintain multiple identities. The idea of identity politics would be challenged by Mr. Sens thesis.An important reason that I chose Oberlin was its commitment to social justice. The fact that Oberlins earliest graduates included women and blacks was important to me. When I was a student there, I was surprised that the school was largely segregated: Blacks generally hung out with one another, as did the whites. It seems as if there is still lots of work left to do.MARC CHAFETZWashington"}
{"text": "The challenges facing the long-struggling Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn seemed to mount on Friday, when the New York City Education Department said an investigation found that its principal and two other administrators had failed to report an allegation of sexual harassment and a suspicion that students had stolen and used a department credit card.It was not clear what penalties the principal, Michael Wiltshire, who said this week that he was considering leaving his position after less than two years, would face as a result of the findings. The department said only that the superintendent overseeing the school would decide on the penalty. But the investigation appeared to be another blow to Mayor Bill de Blasios effort to revive Boys and Girls, which has deep roots in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood but a history of low performance.The New York Post reported on Friday that the department found that Dr. Wiltshire had failed to report an alleged gang rape of a female student in a locker room. But on Friday afternoon, the mother of the student who made the sexual harassment allegation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect her and her daughters privacy, said that no rape had occurred and that her daughter had received a verbal threat, by a young man attending a different high school who was on the Boys and Girls campus. On Friday evening, The Post published an update saying the girl told administrators only that she had been threatened.The mother said her daughter told her about the threat on the night it occurred, and the next day they met with two assistant principals and a guidance counselor. A few days later, they met with the principal, and her daughter gave a written statement. The mother said the boy was banned from Boys and Girls. She said that she was satisfied with the schools response and that, since it was only a verbal threat, she did not want to report the episode to the police.The department would not comment on the specifics of the allegation, other than to say that one student was accused of harassing another. The department said Dr. Wiltshire and the other administrators did not follow mandated reporting procedures, which require submitting a report through the departments Online Occurrence Reporting System within 24 hours as well as reporting allegations of school-related criminal activity to the school safety agent.Dr. Wiltshire did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The department installed Dr. Wiltshire at Boys and Girls in late 2014 while allowing him to remain in charge of the selective school where he was already principal, Medgar Evers College Preparatory High School. Some at Boys and Girls have complained that Dr. Wiltshires attention has been divided and that he has at times appeared to be more loyal to Medgar Evers than to Boys and Girls."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Dont Shortchange Vets in College, by Alexander McCoy (Op-Ed, May 30):A basic principle of 21st-century higher education is that not all college-level learning happens in a classroom. And despite Mr. McCoys view, it also occurs in the halls and on the training fields of the United States military.That is why for more than six decades the American Council on Education has facilitated reviews of military training and occupations to make college-credit recommendations that are considered by more than 2,300 colleges and universities.Working closely with the Defense Department and each military branch, our review teams of college faculty members from accredited institutions carefully analyze the content, scope, rigor and assessment of hundreds of military training programs, courses and specialties.It makes no sense to force veterans who have had both classroom and on-the-job training in roles as varied as medics and I.T. specialists to take college courses that require them to duplicate lessons already learned.Mr. McCoy also applies 15-year-old evaluation criteria in areas like basic training that are more narrowly defined in current credit recommendations. And there are many more intensive courses offered throughout the military in areas like engineering, management and homeland security.There are some schools that prey on veterans.

{"text": "Days after several of his colleagues were awakened in their hotel rooms by the police and arrested on corruption charges last year, Sepp Blatter, the longtime president of FIFA, made an important decision. He decided he deserved a raise.With soccer in crisis and an unprecedented scandal beginning to boil, Mr. Blatter  who had just won re-election to a record fifth four-year term  signed a new employment contract that increased his salary to $3 million a year and guaranteed him a $12 million bonus if he completed his mandate.That arrangement, completed just as FIFA was plunging into organizational chaos, was one of many instances in which three of FIFAs top officials arranged over five years to pay themselves more than $80 million, according to an internal investigation of world soccers governing body by the American law firm Quinn Emanuel.It was the latest in a series of jaw-dropping accusations about a culture of corruption pervading FIFA. For years, top soccer officials have been accused of using bribes and payoffs to profit from their roles overseeing the billions of dollars FIFA and other governing bodies generate through tournaments like the World Cup. But in the past year, dozens of soccer officials  though not the three accused Friday  have been charged with fraud, racketeering and money laundering in a broad corruption investigation led by the United States Justice Department.On Friday, lawyers from Quinn Emanuel, which was hired by FIFA in the wake of last years arrests, published a synopsis of some of the findings of their own investigation. In it, they identified three former FIFA officials  Mr. Blatter and his former deputies Jrme Valcke and Markus Kattner  as having mounted a coordinated effort to enrich themselves through a series of raises, bonuses and other payments.The three were also accused of modifying the termination clauses in their employment contracts to ensure that they would receive multimillion-dollar payouts even if they were fired for cause.They had the authority they needed, Quinn Emanuel investigators wrote of Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner, and they simply told payroll and HR, the department generally in charge for employment contracts at FIFA and which reported to Mr. Kattner, how much should be paid out and to whom.In a statement responding to the accusations, Mr. Blatters lawyer, Richard Cullen, said Friday, We look forward to showing FIFA that Mr. Blatters compensation payments were proper, fair and in line with the heads of major professional sports leagues around the world.Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner did not immediately respond to FIFAs statement.None of the three men currently work for FIFA. Mr. Blatter was barred from soccer by FIFA in December and replaced by a new president, Gianni Infantino, in an election in February. FIFA suspended Mr. Valcke, Mr. Blatters longtime deputy, last fall and fired him in January amid accusations of corruption. Mr. Valcke was replaced temporarily as secretary general by FIFAs finance director, Mr. Kattner. That effectively placed Mr. Kattner in control of FIFAs finances in the months leading to this years presidential election, but he, too, was fired, in May, after FIFA said it had discovered he had breached his fiduciary duty to the organization.The accusations by FIFA and its lawyers seemed intended to paint a picture of a leadership group operating outside FIFA financial controls: In 2010, Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner were awarded $23 million in retroactive bonuses for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that FIFA said were not called for under their employment agreements. In 2011, with Mr. Blatter in a contested election for the FIFA presidency, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner were given eight-year contract extensions that included guarantees that they would receive full payment of their salaries if they lost their jobs, a likely outcome under a new president. That same year, Mr. Blatter received a bonus of 12 million Swiss francs (about $12 million) for overseeing the 2014 World Cup. In May 2015, only days after the arrests of several of their colleagues in Zurich, Mr. Blatter, who signed a contract in 2008 that paid him 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) a year, executed a new contract that increased his salary to about $3 million and included the prospect of another performance bonus of $12 million if he completed his term.A day after that, Mr. Kattners contract was extended four years  through December 2023  and modified to include a clause that he be paid in full even if he was fired. In its statement, FIFA dryly labeled the timing of that contract extension noteworthy.The details of Quinn Emanuels investigation deflected attention  at least momentarily  away from two other FIFA stories this week: the news that the Swiss attorney generals office had conducted a new raid on FIFA headquarters in Zurich on Friday as part of a continuing investigation into possible corruption, and recent issues regarding transparency that have plagued Mr. Infantino. Earlier this week, a German newspaper reported that Mr. Infantino had worked behind the scenes to marginalize FIFAs independent auditor in a leadership power struggle.That situation came to light when the auditor, Domenico Scala, abruptly resigned at FIFAs recent Congress in Mexico, saying that Mr. Infantino and others had orchestrated a change in FIFAs bylaws that shifted the power to hire and fire the independent ethics officials with FIFAs new governing council  a body led by Mr. Infantino.FIFA has defended Mr. Infantino by saying the shift was done to protect the organization against the possibility it might be unable to separate itself from individuals who come under investigation, but the assertion seemed to run counter to Mr. Infantinos professed support for reform and his stated goal of greater separation of powers at FIFA.Then this week came the German report, which said that Mr. Infantino had instructed FIFA staff members to delete recordings of an executive session in which removing Mr. Scala had been discussed. Mr. Scala, as part of his role leading the audit and compliance committee, also was responsible for setting Mr. Infantinos salary  a process that reportedly had gone poorly, with Mr. Infantino describing Mr. Scalas initial proposal of a $2 million salary as insulting.All of this comes as FIFA tries to emerge from the worst corruption scandal in its history, a period which began just over a year ago when more than a dozen soccer and sports marketing officials with ties to soccers global governing body were arrested in predawn raids before a FIFA meeting in Zurich. Several have pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the United States, including more FIFA executives arrested in a second Zurich raid in December.Many of those executives held top posts in the FIFA led by Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner, so it was not surprising that more detailed allegations against the three men might emerge. In its news release on Friday, FIFA and its lawyers accused Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner of working together to bulk up their compensation in agreements as far back as 2007.The evidence, the lawyers said, revealed breaches of fiduciary duty and also raised questions about FIFAs internal financial controls, especially the role of its compensation subcommittee. It was unclear whether all the salary and bonuses were paid and if FIFA would seek to recover any of it.FIFA said that all of the contracts would face further investigation, and that it had shared its findings with the Swiss attorney generals office and would do the same with the Justice Department."}

In fact I want to find out whats going on with him.As his voice trailed off, Mr. Trump noticed a man in the crowd.Oh look at my African-American over here, Mr. Trump said. Are you the greatest? Do you know what Im talking about?Mr. Trump then returned to speaking about the Arizona episode.The man he had pointed to, Gregory Cheadle, a local real estate broker running for a Republican nomination for a congressional seat, said in an interview Friday night that it was surreal to be called out by Mr. Trump.Mr. Cheadle said he was not offended by the remark, which he at first could not hear over the noise of the crowd. Ive had people come to me  and these were whites  tell me that they were offended, he said. And I appreciate them saying that, but I wasnt offended by it.He also clarified that he is not actually a Trump supporter, saying that he went to a Bernie Sanders rally the night before. Id describe myself as someone who is searching for answers, Mr. Cheadle said.At the Arizona rally Mr. Trump was referring to, a Trump supporter punched a protester wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit as the person was being escorted out.As the African-American cold-cocked this guy, and this guy never knew what happened, everybody thought the African-American was against me, and it was the opposite, Mr. Trump said at his rally Friday. He was like this great guy, military guy. We have tremendous African-American support. The reason is Im going to bring jobs back to our country.Mr. Trumps comments come as his campaign is fending off charges of racism over his remarks about Gonzalo P.

Mr. Trump has suggested that he believes the judge is biased because he happens to be, we believe, Mexican.Judge Curiel was born in Indiana; he is of Mexican descent."}
{"text": "Midtown East has long been known as an area of expensive hotels, easy access to Grand Central Terminal and the United Nations. But proper pubs? Not really. The area (those who live there call it Turtle Bay) has long specialized in rowdy white-collar hookup joints, expensive wine bars and paint-by-number Irish saloons. Not to mention the occasional sketchy massage parlor.That all changed in the fall of 2013 when Hudson Malone opened. Doug Quinn, a former bartender at the beloved P.J. Clarkes, opened the bar on 218 East 53rd Street, replacing another of the neighborhoods ubiquitous frat-house watering holes (this one called Tammany Hall) in a 116-year-old two-story building. On the menu are burgers and what the staff refers to as New York comfort food.But the draw at Hudson Malone is its owner. Depending on whom you ask, Mr. Quinns firing from P.J. Clarkes was either an outrage or totally justified. There was a heated dispute between two patrons, and Mr. Quinn was not hesitant about picking sides and stating his case. P.J. Clarkes did not respond to a call seeking comment.Not in dispute is that as a bartender, he has a devoted following.Joe Carey, 48, a crisis communications consultant who works in Midtown, has been ordering pints from Mr. Quinn for more than a decade.Doug is the real deal, he said on a recent spring evening at Hudson Malone. He called Mr. Quinn flat out the best bartender in New York.Mr. Quinns idea for Hudson Malone (which is named after his sons) was doctors and lawyers mixing it up with carpenters and contractors. On that night, the mix was pretty balanced.Imogen Lloyd Webber, daughter of Andrew, senior editor at Broadway.com and author of a new book called The Intelligent Conversationalist, was enjoying a glass of white wine. She is about as local as you can get. It really is an old-school neighborhood place, Ms. Webber said.Nearby was another right-brained regular, Kaytlin Bailey, a 29-year-old comedian. When I was even more poor than I am now, Doug would tolerate me just ordering water, while watching me con dudes into buying me dinner, she said. He always had my back.The dcor at Hudson Malone is from another time  turn-of-the-century lamps, coffered tin ceilings, various Knickerbocker-themed knickknacks. Just as anachronistic is the owners wardrobe, which usually consists of French-cuffed button down shirts and a rotation of Turnbull & Asser bow ties.The bow tie is built into the bars neon marquee, and it is also emblazoned on an indoor chalkboard labeled Quinns Laws. Among adages like failure creates success is what might well be the motto of the bar: Revenge is a beer best poured cold.But Mr. Quinn, 48, no longer wants to talk about his former job. (The only picture of that place happens to be strategically located above the mens toilet in the basement.)On Tuesday nights, when the upstairs piano is pounding and customers convene among paintings of legendary saloon proprietors like Toots Shor and Elaine Kaufman, its clear what Mr. Quinn is aspiring to.The bartenders know my drink the minute I get in, said Greg Williams, a 38-year-old research analyst who works two blocks away. Its like a speakeasy minus the waxed mustaches and stupid suspenders in actual annoying speakeasies.Mr. Williams was drinking with his identical twin, Robert, near the bars antique jukebox. You wont find much Pearl Jam and Elvis Costello playing at any other East Midtown bar, he said. Plus, no plastic cups, which is rare for this area."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM  Mr. President! a woman called out to Waad Qannam at a rally last week in East Jerusalem. We want you to represent us! The crowd cheered passionately, even though Mr. Qannam was actually running for president on a reality television show.In the United States, a reality television star is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For Palestinians, its the other way around: A candidate chosen on a television show is the closest they have come to an elected leader in more than 10 years.This is just a show, acknowledged Mr. Qannam, one of three contestants who made it to Thursday nights finale of The President. But people are hungry for a leader.The show, now in its second season, began with 24 contestants culled from more than 1,200 applicants who had to take a series of exams on Palestinian politics, international law, development and gender equality. Each week, contestants shadowed a Palestinian minister or business person, then told a panel of judges what they had learned and how they would improve on the job.They also held election rallies while cameras were rolling and had to campaign for votes from the audience, who voted via text message at 80 cents a pop. A mix of votes from judges and the audience determined who made it to the next rounds, though in the finale only audience votes counted. Because there was no cap on how many times viewers could vote, money played a considerable role, and candidates raised funds to secure votes from viewers.On Thursday night, the three finalists all had similar platforms: Boycott Israel. Designate East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Bring about a reconciliation for the bitterly divided Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza. (Six of the candidates in the round of 24 were from Gaza, though none made it to the final round.)Mr. Qannam  Muslim, male and from East Jerusalem  was the leading candidate. Studying to be a lawyer, Mr. Qannam, 24, is the son of refugees, broadening his appeal in the hardscrabble camps across the West Bank. His mother is a deputy minister of Jerusalem affairs in the Palestinian Authority. And he had a nice smile.The only female finalist, Nemah Adawiah, 22, studies international relations at Birzeit University near Ramallah. She drew some resentment because her wealthy family was bankrolling her campaign, and scrutiny about her appearance when the judges deemed some of her colorful outfits inappropriate.The third finalist, Fadi Khair, a 35-year-old Christian and pediatric nurse, had backers who felt he needed to broaden his appeal to Muslim voters. You need a priest and a sheikh to sit in the front row, mused a friend at a campaign meeting before Thursdays finale.The President  broadcast on the Maan satellite network to large audiences in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Arab world  was funded mostly by a State Department grant to Search for Common Ground, a nongovernmental group that focuses on conflict resolution.Suheir Rasul, the groups co-director, said the point of the show was to groom young Palestinians to be future leaders. Yet the subtext was aimed at the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is now 11 years into what was meant to have been a five-year term and has offered no signs of handing over power.In an odd twist, many judges on the show were Palestinian officials, and the Palestinian Authority allowed its organizers to use their facilities. Advisers to Mr. Abbas did not respond to requests for comment on the show.The show is a message for the Palestinian leadership, said Raed Othman, Maans general director. Elections are the solution. Democracy is the solution.Before the finale, Mr. Khair, the pediatric nurse, was deeply worried about how to raise enough funds.We focus on the rich, not the poor, because they barely have enough for their daily bread, said his mother, Hannah Khair, before the finale. They were focusing on people in his hometown, Beit Sahour, a village in the West Bank, and Christians excited to see one of their own vie for president.Ahead of the penultimate episode, he spent about $7,800 to secure nearly 10,000 votes. As he prepared his speech for the final episode, Mr. Khair estimated he needed to secure at least 20,000 votes to have a chance at winning.I want to talk about economic resistance, he said. A call for foreign investment and Palestinian investment, he said, but was interrupted by his wife, Mirna, 25, holding their 3-year-old son, Jihad, as he vomited on the kitchen floor.Mr. Khair continued while helping his wife. Ill talk about diplomacy, he said.Ms. Adawiahs family took care of nearly everything. Her father, Bahjat Adawiah, 72, organized her election rally on a recent night in Al Ram, a neighborhood near Jerusalem, tucked behind Israels separation barrier, where he owns several properties.I am the daughter of Jerusalem! she read, practicing her speech. Her father paced and chain-smoked. Speak more forcefully! he told her. She wants to win, so I have to support her. Shes our little spoiled girl, he added, grinning.But the shows producers noted that Ms. Adawiah had worked extremely hard and impressed the judges. Money alone could not have propelled her to the finale, they said.Her fathers business partners, Al Rams mayor and other prominent residents piled into a school hall, where her rally underscored womens participation: There was a female master of ceremonies, and a womens folkloric dance troupe entertained guests.We want you to be the president, and why not? said Ali Maslamani, the mayor. Our long Islamic history is filled with female leaders!But Mr. Qannam was clearly the most popular candidate.In an East Jerusalem soccer club on a recent night, he barely got through his platform before residents began endorsing him.Mustafa Shabani, a 23-year-old who works two jobs to support his family, said he had spent at least $7 on votes for Mr. Qannam.Mr. Othman, the general director of Maan, said the influence of money made the show more realistic. You can sit in a cafe and have a great idea  but so what? he said. Show me the money.During Thursdays finale in a Ramallah studio, Mr. Khair stumbled through his speech. Ms. Adawiah laced hers with religion and nationalism. It is time to change what is inside ourselves, so we can change our sick reality, she said.In the end, though, it was Mr. Qannams night.You are standing before an important decision! he told the audience. He promised his first act as president would be to visit Gaza and heal a decade-old rift between Palestinians. I will reconcile our nation!Were it not that I loved this homeland, I would not have done this, he said. This is a duty, not an honor!The audience roared. Waad Qannam! Waad Qannam! Waad Qannam! the back rows shouted.Mr. Qannam won with nearly 42,000 votes, compared with roughly 28,000 for Ms. Adawiah and about 14,000 for Mr. Khair. His prize? A car, plus the prominence and political connections that come from being on the show.He struggled to speak over the ecstatic audience. This is not my victory! he called out. It is a victory for Palestine!Nearby, that victory was hard to stomach. Ms. Adawiahs family alleged that organizers had falsified the tally, arguing they had receipts for 41,000 votes they had secured for their daughter.I bought 24,000 votes! shouted one of her relatives. Where are they?"}
{"text": "Rufus Wainwright remembers June 14, 2006, as the night he climbed a musical Mount Everest. Or jumped off one.Id never done it from top to bottom until the first night I performed it, the singer-songwriter recalled of Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall, his song-by-song re-creation of a legendary concert that Judy Garland performed at the same space in 1961.Backed by a 36-piece orchestra, Mr. Wainwright summoned Garlands restless spirit in jazzy anthems like Thats Entertainment and openhearted ballads like Stormy Weather. He even repeated some of Garlands original banter (Sing it with me, please!), like a Talmudic scholar reciting a sacred text.The result was part showbiz stunt, part postmodern happening, part fanboy dream come true. It was a 32-year-old pop star claiming Judy worship for a new, post-Stonewall generation of gay men. And it has lived on in its live-album incarnation, for which Mr. Wainwright received his sole Grammy nomination.Now, 10 years later, he is resurrecting the concert at Carnegie Hall: a homage to a homage. After playing New York on June 16 and 17, he will take the show the following week to the Luminato Festival in Toronto, where his husband, Jrn Weisbrodt, is the outgoing artistic director.But Mr. Wainwright is not the same performer, or person, that he was a decade ago. He is now 42, four years older than Garland was when she mounted the original concert. Still louche and languid, he has acquired a touch of silver on his sideburns and a glut of life experiences, both joyful and bruising.Since the 2006 concert, he married Mr. Weisbrodt, fathered a child (with his longtime friend Lorca Cohen, the daughter of the singer Leonard Cohen) and weathered the ups and downs of the music business. Most life-altering was the loss of his mother, the folk singer Kate McGarrigle, who died of cancer in 2010.All those milestones will inevitably color the Carnegie Hall repertoire, which for Garland encapsulated the glamour and mess of a life lived in emotional extremis. (She died eight years after the 1961 concert from a barbiturate overdose.)Mr. Wainwright is no stranger to turmoil himself. The product of an eccentric musical clan (his father is the troubadour Loudon Wainwright III, and his mother was half of a Canadian folk duo with her sister Anna McGarrigle), he released his self-titled debut album in 1998, when he was 24.He once memorably described his 20s as gay hell: a haze of alcohol and drug abuse, anonymous sex and emotional nihilism, which he touted obliquely in songs like Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk, his ode to decadence.His debauchery went hand in hand with an obsession with Garland. I kept having these blackouts where I would go to record stores looking to buy the latest Radiohead album and walk out with yet another Greatest Hits of Judy Garland, he said on a recent Thursday at the Whitney Museums eighth-floor cafe. Part of the reason he staged the Carnegie Hall show in 2006 was to exorcise her.For the most part, it worked. After New York, he took the concert to the London Palladium. But by the time he got to Paris, he had lost his voice, and the show was a complete disaster. He limped to the Hollywood Bowl but had this real sinking feeling that I couldnt continue.Then life got even more complicated.Mr. Wainwright and his mother, he said, were one of the most classic gay-son-mother duos ever, speaking every other day. Even Mr. Weisbrodt, who had become Mr. Wainwrights first serious romantic partner, acknowledged: I never challenged her position. To me, it was always clear she was No. 1 and I was No. 2. But I would sleep with him.As her health declined, Mr. Wainwright panicked, even as he was considering becoming a parent himself. He and Ms. Cohen, whom he knew from growing up in Montreal, had discussed conceiving a child together, but mostly it was a lovely little daydream, he said. Then Ms. Cohen brought it up again, for real.His mother also urged him to pursue fatherhood, perhaps sensing that he would need an emotional anchor when she was gone. That Ms. Cohen came from another Canadian musical dynasty may have given the idea some extra appeal, like a medieval alliance.My mother was a very ambitious woman, but mostly for her children, Mr. Wainwright said, still palpably affected by his mothers death but cleareyed about her flaws. She wasnt really able to be that way for herself, and in fact was always somewhat haunted by not being blessed with that cutthroat instinct that a lot of her colleagues had, whether its Bonnie Raitt or Linda Ronstadt. They were better at maneuvering the system than she was.Sadly his mother didnt live to see the plan come to fruition. She died on Jan. 18, 2010, nearly a year before her granddaughter, Viva Wainwright Cohen, was born.Suspended between grief and renewal, Mr. Wainwright sought to solidify his newfangled family. A few months after his mothers death, he proposed to Mr. Weisbrodt over Indian food in London. (He announced the engagement the next night, onstage at the Royal Opera House.)The couple had met in Germany, when Mr. Weisbrodt was working at the Berlin State Opera and approached Mr. Wainwright about a commission. Rufus was very nervous about having a committed relationship, Mr. Weisbrodt recalled. The longest relationship he had been in was I think four weeks.They married in August 2012, in Montauk, N.Y., with the cabaret chanteuse Justin Vivian Bond officiating and little Viva as reluctant flower girl. Mr. Wainwright is Vivas legal parent, but he only sees her every few months; she lives in Los Angeles with her mother, while Mr. Wainwright and Mr. Weisbrodt split their time between New York and Toronto, though they are thinking of moving out west. (He is reticent about the complicated parenting dynamic with Ms. Cohen but said, Were getting better all the time.)A death, a birth and a marriage, all in the span of two and a half years: It did a number on Mr. Wainwright. Having my mothers death and my daughters birth coincide, it was very traumatic for everybody, he said with a rueful, nasal laugh, the kind he tends to affix to moments of gravitas.His melancholy, along with his waggish humor, goes more unguarded in his songs. Musically, he resists categorization. His last album, Take All My Loves, was an adaptation of nine Shakespeare sonnets, with vocal cameos by singers like Florence Welch and William Shatner.He has spent the last few years immersed in opera, which he calls his favorite art form. His first opera, Prima Donna, was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera and Lincoln Center Theater, but he and the Met parted ways before it was staged. The official line was that Mr. Wainwright, who wrote the libretto in French, refused to bend to the Mets insistence that it be in English.Though Prima Donna eventually opened at the Manchester International Festival in 2009 (Mr. Wainwright came dressed as Verdi), the opera establishment never fully embraced him. In 2012, Zachary Woolfe of The New York Times described its American debut as a tasteful, well-intentioned, ultimately mystifying failure. (He is now working on a second opera, about the Roman emperor Hadrian.)His forays into classical music sidetracked him from pursuing the pop megastardom he once envisioned. Though he admits to enjoying the slings and arrows and diva hissy fits and conductors smashing batons of the opera world, he acknowledges that it has distanced me from the pop world.And Ive paid a price for that, he added.In a de facto rehearsal run for Carnegie Hall, Mr. Wainwright arrived in Annapolis, Md., last month as part of a three-night mini-tour that took him to the Rams Head on Stage, a smallish concert space adjoining a tavern.Wearing a foppish striped blazer adorned with a twinkling brooch, he played a few of his own brooding, folky ballads, before telling the audience: Were going to do a few Judy songs for you. Im not sure if you were expecting that, but thats what you got.The mostly white-haired crowd seemed unfazed as he jumped to the swinging tempo of the 1938 standard You Go to My Head. A few verses in, he appeared to flub the words, singing Da da beeda foona heena fa fa. But devotees knew that this was entirely planned: It was the exact spot where Garland had forgotten the lyrics in 1961 and frantically subbed in nonsense syllables.Lets get sad, he announced after the song ended, switching to another Garland standard, the smoldering torch song Alone Together.At Carnegie Hall 10 years ago, he dedicated the number to Mr. Weisbrodt. I dont think he would dedicate Alone Together to me anymore, his husband says now. It sort of stands for someone whos accepted that hes in a relationship, but at the end of the day youre always still alone.That isnt the only Garland song that has shifted resonance over the decade. When Mr. Wainwright sang The Man That Got Away in 2006, he thought of it less as an ode to romantic abandonment (as when  Garland sang it) than as a gay mans cry of longing for a father. My dad and I are in a much better place than we were 10 years ago, he said of his fraught, at times openly competitive relationship with his father. But nonetheless, when I was singing that at that time, we were struggling.Now, Mr. Wainwright says, The Man That Got Away is more about mortality, whether his fathers (who is 69) or that of his musical father figures like David Bowie and Lou Reed.Then again, mortality seems to pervade the entire repertoire. Death has sort of entered the fold a little bit, Mr. Wainwright said. The generation that grew up with the original Garland album has thinned out a bit, meaning that the crowd that shows up this time will be even further removed from the source material.And, of course, the loss of his mother haunts the set list, particularly Garlands signature number, Over the Rainbow. When Mr. Wainwright sang it in 2006, he brought his mother out to accompany him on the piano, joking about how she would volunteer him to sing it as a child to sober up adults at 3 in the morning.This time around, Mr. Wainwright plans to start singing the song a cappella, letting his mothers absence linger before the orchestra floods in.Thats still her song, and now she is over the rainbow, he said, before letting out another mournful laugh."}
{"text": "Another hedge fund that was caught up in the federal governments crackdown on insider trading is getting back money it forfeited to authorities in the course of the investigation.Federal prosecutors have agreed to return $6 million that Diamondback Capital Management forfeited as part of a nonprosecution agreement, according to a court filing on Friday.The decision by federal prosecutors to return the money is a rare event, but it represents more fallout from a landmark appeals court ruling that resulted in the dismissal of a number of insider trading convictions, including the conviction of a former portfolio manager at Diamondback.The court filing by prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, does not specifically refer to the appellate ruling but notes there have been subsequent legal developments to the signing of the nonprosecution agreement in January 2012.This year, the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to return $3 million paid by Diamondback to resolve a related civil investigation.In January, securities regulators agreed to return $21.5 million in settlement money paid out by another hedge fund, Level Global Advisors, to resolve a related insider trading investigation.Both Diamondback and Level Global were raided by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2010 as part of a broad crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry that at one point led to the conviction of more than 80 people. Both hedge funds eventually shut their doors.The investigation led to the filing of insider trading charges against Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback, and Anthony Chiasson, a founder of Level Global. Both men were convicted on insider trading charges, but the appellate court threw out the convictions in a ruling that dramatically narrowed the ability of authorities to pursue certain kinds of insider trading cases.Diamondback, according to the court filing, agreed to hold harmless prosecutors and the F.B.I. as part of the decision to return the money. The $6 million represented what authorities said were profits based, in whole, or in part, on material nonpublic information obtained and utilized by Diamondback employees in an illegal manner.Steve bruce, a spokesman for Diamondback Capital said, We recognize that it is highly unusual for the government to voluntarily take this action, and appreciate their efforts to bring fair and final closure to the matter.Mr. Bharara has criticized the appellate ruling in the Newman case and was disappointed when the Supreme Court refused to take the matter up on appeal. And while Mr. Bharara has said he disagrees with the ruling, his office subsequently dismissed convictions and guilty pleas it had obtained against several other people in light of the decision.The return of money to Diamondback now moves Mr. Bhararas office one step closer to closing the door on the fallout from the Newman case."}
{"text": "Jeff Hornacek was introduced on Friday as the Knicks 28th head coach. That may have been the teams first upset victory of the season.Phil Jackson, the team president, is famously wedded to a network of disciples who coach, or at least adhere to, his signature triangle offense. Hornacek, a head coach with the Phoenix Suns and a veteran of 14 N.B.A. seasons, is outside Jacksons circle.Probably the only words I ever said to him: Congratulations on the championship again when they beat us two times, Hornacek said, referring to Jacksons Chicago Bulls, who defeated the Utah Jazz twice in the N.B.A. finals. Id never talked to him a lot prior to that.This could be a good thing if the same forces that compelled Jackson to go beyond his tight circle get him to rethink his attachment to the triangle.Its fascinating to have witnessed the Knicks drama and dysfunction and ever-revolving cycle of coaches. My first encounter came in 1987 when Bob Hill was  fired as head coach and Scotty Stirling was ousted as the general manager. Richard H. Evans, the chief executive of Madison Square Garden, proclaimed his intention to turn the Garden back into a caldron of winning. He said the firings were necessary to bring a fresh approach to management and coaching, and to bring winning back to the Garden.The Knicks hired Al Bianchi as general manager and Rick Pitino as head coach. In his introductory news conference, Pitino gushed about his new job. Acknowledging that he would never play for the Knicks, he said that the next best thing was to coach the Knicks. Pitino said his goal was to bring the Knicks back to where we once were.Two years later, Pitino, who had been feuding with Bianchi, left to become the coach of the Kentucky Wildcats. (In an interesting twist, in June 1989, Pitino, asked who should succeed him as Knicks coach, said the team should hire Phil Jackson, at the time an assistant in Chicago.)The Knicks hired a Jackson, but it was Stu Jackson, Pitinos assistant, who said he jumped in the air, kicked my heels and screamed for joy. After his first workout, Jackson, at the time the N.B.A.s youngest head coach, proclaimed that the Knicks would be among the teams to beat in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks never were, and Jackson was fired in December 1990 and replaced by John MacLeod, whom Bianchi described as a proven winner.MacLeod left after a season for Notre Dame.I was present in May 1991 when Pat Riley was introduced as Knicks coach, in one of the most hyped news conferences I had ever attended. Riley had coached the Lakers to four N.B.A. titles and was expected to bring Showtime to the Garden.At his news conference Riley invoked the memory of exciting days at the Garden he experienced as a kid growing up in upstate New York. As a player and as a coach, coming to Madison Square Garden was always special, Riley said. It was an event. Whether it takes a year or two to get to that point, we want that atmosphere to come back to New York.The Knicks reached the N.B.A. finals once under Riley but lost to the Houston Rockets in 1994. Riley left in June 1995 after a nasty feud with the Garden president, Dave Checketts.Then Don Nelson was hired, vowing to bring a title back to the Garden. Ive never won a title as a coach, Nelson said. That burns inside of me. Its the one thing I want. And this organization is ready for it.Knicks fans were starved for it. But Nelson was fired in March 1996 and replaced by Jeff Van Gundy, who led the Knicks to the second round of the playoffs that season. Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned in December 2001 and was replaced by Don Chaney.Hes the guy that we want coaching this team, and his leadership both on and off the court has shown us that hes the right guy to lead our team, said Scott Layden, the teams general manager.Layden and Chaney were fired by the team president Isiah Thomas and replaced by Lenny Wilkens in January 2004. Hes the perfect person to lead us in this environment of change, Thomas said.Wilkens resigned in 2005 and was replaced by Larry Brown, who also invoked the spirit of the Knicks past in the person of Red Holzman. Growing up, I had a lot of heroes in my life, Brown said. But walking into the Garden and seeing 613 and Coach Holzmans name up there, thats always meant a lot to me. Because when you talk about playing the right way, nobody did it any better than him.On Friday, Hornacek was sitting under the banner of Holzmans 613 victories.Brown was fired in 2006; Thomas took over as coach and was fired in 2008 and replaced by Mike DAntoni. DAntoni promised  and delivered  a wide-open offense. There were no titles. Not even close. He was fired in 2012 and replaced by Mike Woodson, who promised a lions den defense. The Knicks played better defense but did not win enough games to suit Phil Jackson, who fired Woodson in 2014, replacing him with Derek Fisher, Jacksons former player and a triangle devotee. Fisher was fired last February, and Kurt Rambis, a Jackson disciple, became interim coach.During Fridays news conference Jackson was asked whether he thought the task of rebuilding the Knicks would be so difficult; did he think he would already be on his third head coach?Whos counting? he responded. You hope to have a guy that comes in, has success and is able to continue for a duration of time. I dont know if thats harder or getting players is harder.Here we are, Jackson concluded, Doing what we have to do to move forward. Thats the important part.Here we are, indeed.Playing for the 76ers at the end of his career, Hornacek heard a rumor that he was being traded to the Knicks. The trade never materialized, but Hornacek always wondered, What if?Soon, Hornacek, like a dozen predecessors, will find out."}
{"text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y.  During his 14-year N.B.A. career, Jeff Hornacek barely spoke to Phil Jackson. The only recollection of a conversation Hornacek could cite on Friday was when he played for the Utah Jazz in the 1997 and 1998 N.B.A. finals against the Chicago Bulls, who were coached by Jackson.I think probably the only words I ever said to him were, Congratulations on the championship again, when they beat us two times, Hornacek said.Hornacek, 53, offered up that anecdote as he was introduced as the Knicks 28th head coach; only one of the previous ones, Red Holzman, has ever won a championship, and his last one was 43 years ago. Whether Hornacek could become No. 2 is anyones guess, but if it does happen, it is not likely to be any time soon.Nevertheless, in a news conference at the teams practice complex, Hornacek came off as confident and self-assured as he spoke about using the triangle as one element  but not the only one  of the Knicks offense; ruminated on his two best players, Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis; and said the key to winning basketball was to buckle down defensively.As he spoke, Jackson was seated close by to his right. Until recently, Jackson said Friday, he had long been a fan of Hornacek and his basketball acumen, but from afar. Still, Jackson said, that was enough to put Hornacek at the top of the list of head-coaching candidates that he and Knicks General Manager Steve Mills drew up this spring.They said that Hornacek was the first candidate they had contacted and that Jackson, after his initial six-hour meeting with Hornacek, had told Mills he thought they had the man for the job. It turned out they did.Hornacek takes over a franchise whose future is far from glistening. Anthony, whom Hornacek repeatedly referred to as a superstar on Friday, turned 32 last week and dealt with a number of injuries last season. Whether he might prefer to be traded to a championship contender is a continuing question despite Anthonys periodic statements that he wants to stay put.Kristaps Porzingis, the teams only other recognized asset, had an impressive rookie campaign but remains an unfinished product. Hornacek said it could take another four years before Porzingis reaches his potential. By then, who knows where Anthony will be.Since Jackson was named the Knicks president in March 2014, the team has gone through four coaches. Jackson quickly dismissed Mike Woodson, whom he inherited when he took the job, and replaced him with Derek Fisher, who had never coached before but had played for Jackson when he coached the Los Angeles Lakers.Fisher lasted only a season and a half, compiling a 40-96 record before being fired. Kurt Rambis, a longtime Jackson ally, took over as interim coach but did not do much better, going 9-19.That is a lot of coaching turnover in a short period, and on Friday, Jackson appeared to become defensive when asked if the instability had gotten in the way of his vision for the team.Whos counting? Jackson said dismissively of the coaching changes. He later added, Were doing what we have to do to move forward, and thats the important part.Not surprisingly, the second question at the news conference was about the triangle offense that is so closely identified with Jackson and how much Hornacek intended to use it. Hornaceks answer was that he would use it, or at least key elements of it, but that he would employ other offensive strategies as well.In other words, Hornacek indicated that he saw the triangle as part of a larger offensive philosophy, an answer Jackson seemed fine with.Am I going to run the triangle? Hornacek said. I would say I wouldnt call it the triangle. Theres a lot of aspects of the triangle  the spacing, the cuts off hitting the post  that are not unique to the triangle.Its all part of basketball, and Jeff recognizes that, Jackson said.At several moments in the news conference, Jackson tried to intersperse bits of humor into the occasion, at one point comparing the challenging quest for quality cafeteria food at the Knicks practice complex to the difficulty in beating out other teams for free agents.At other times, he was more direct.Weve started all over again, Jackson said of the Knicks. Weve cleaned our roster, weve garnered money and space, and weve changed the context of what this team is."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Youre Stuck, America. Get a Move On!, by Arthur C. Brooks (Op-Ed, May 21):Why should out-of-work, often poor people in areas where jobs are scarce be forced to move to states of low unemployment? Just as reasonably, factories, warehouses and call centers should locate in zones where there are plenty of workers who want jobs and who will cost their employers less because labor is in surplus and jobs are in demand.In the meantime, the new facilities will help restore a broken community, not hollow it out through out-migration forced by economic circumstances.With Mr. Brookss proposed solution, neighborhoods are shattered. Workers leave behind their homes, their communities and their support networks and risk taking up a new job in a new state.Flipping it around, employers who locate facilities where the workers are will be rewarded by more centered, more dedicated employees in stable communities.I know that its fashionable to use economic data to inform policy making. But policy makers need to keep in mind that there are often two or more ways to interpret the same data set.STEPHEN R. DUJACKCharlottesville, Va."}
{"text": "Urbana, Ill.  THIS spring my friends daughter received exciting news: She had been accepted to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Its our hometown campus, but also the states flagship public university and one of the best research institutions in the country.My friend is a single mom with a few part-time jobs; finances are tight in her house. But the university offered them a decent financial aid package, one that would have made it possible for her daughter to attend. If, that is, it was an offer they could count on. But they couldnt. The financial aid letter clearly stated that their award was contingent upon continued funding from the state, and might need to be reduced or rescinded, depending on what happened in Springfield, the state capital.Ah, Springfield.Our lawmakers have spent the last year locked in a staggering budget impasse, with no end in sight. The state is deep in debt, with mountains of unpaid bills, while the Democratic-led Legislature and the Republican governor fight a war of attrition. Another deadline just blew by this week: May 31 was the last official day of the legislative session. Still no budget. Any proposal now needs a three-fifths majority to pass, an even higher bar. Meanwhile, the collateral damage is swirling like sand in a windstorm.Take state-funded Monetary Award Program grants. Normally awarded by both public and private schools throughout the state, these need-based grants went unfunded for nine straight months, from July to April. Most schools temporarily floated funds to cover the gap, but the money was running dry, causing some schools to either renege on grants they had offered, or even, in the case of Chicagos Illinois Institute of Technology, to ask students to pay back the aid they had already received.April brought a brief glimpse of hope. The passage of a temporary bipartisan spending bill keeps state universities partially funded through the summer by appropriating $600 million from the states Educational Assistance Fund, including funding for MAP grants. On the surface, this looked like good news. But in effect, it translates to a 70 percent funding cut for most state schools. And its only a temporary fix. Come Sept. 1, it will run out.As for my friends daughter, she couldnt take the risk. She went with her second choice, an out-of-state school.Who wouldnt be wary? Why accept an offer that provides aid in one breath, while in the next tells you the state might take it away? Students throughout Illinois, advised by nervous parents and guidance counselors, have made similar choices. And those are the lucky ones, the ones with options. Others less fortunate may give up on college altogether.Faculty and staff are nervous, too. Public universities across the state are laying people off at alarming rates. Chicago State University, the predominantly African-American school that has made national headlines lately for its rapid dismantling, laid off 300 employees this spring. A full 30 percent of its budget comes from the state; it now says it may not be able to open come fall if the impasse continues. Downstate, in the hamlet of Charleston, Eastern Illinois University has laid off 261 employees. Over in Macomb, at Western Illinois University, the number is 110.Even at the University of Illinois, where financial reserves are deeper, departments have had to name the employees they will cut come Aug. 27, if the budget remains stalled. In the meantime, hiring is frozen on all three campuses  Urbana, Springfield and Chicago; only essential positions are being filled. Faculty members nearing retirement wonder whether they will receive their pensions because the state has mismanaged its pension funds for decades; its now looking at a pension shortfall of about $111 billion.President Timothy Killeen issued a statement on June 1 saying he was deeply concerned and declaring all options on the table, including layoffs, cuts and unit closures. In the face of so much instability, more and more professors are being wooed away: Faculty resignations were up by almost 70 percent in 2015.Public universities were founded on the notion that all students, regardless of their socio-economic status, should have access to a high-quality education. Like the twin towns of Champaign-Urbana, our public universities are cultural oases  intellectual watering holes where students of all backgrounds can gather in the pursuit of education and knowledge. But these oases are drying up while Springfield continues its interminable standoff.Illinoisans are fed up. Yes, the problem is gnarly and complicated. Yes, the political divisions are deep and wide, just as they are nationally. But our governor and legislators must find a way to cross them soon and to pass a functional budget, before the damage theyve already done to public higher education becomes irreversible. Until they do, our best students will head elsewhere for college  or, even worse, nowhere at all."}
{"text": "For all its imperfections, shareholder democracy has real value. For evidence, look no further than a plethora of cases this week in which voting is proving to be of great consequence.Facebooks board is planning now for the future of the supervoting power of its founder Mark Zuckerberg, while investors in Sika, the Swiss maker of building materials, are fighting the sale of just such a controlling minority stake. Sometimes, as at Tribune Publishing, votes are merely protests. A mistake at the ballot box, however, is costing T. Rowe Price hard cash.Its too easy to be jaded about some initiatives. For example, the shareholder votes required by the Securities and Exchange Commission on executive pay are not binding. Yet it has turned out that in most cases, boards have tried to change plans if even a large minority  maybe 30 percent or so  expresses displeasure with the rewards. In a reversal from the steady increases in recent years, average compensation for the highest-paid American corporate chieftains fell 15 percent in 2015, according to Equilar.Likewise, its easy to argue that investors who buy into companies with multiple classes of shares know what they are getting into. Witness the havoc at Viacom, where Sumner Redstone is using his elite voting status to keep a firm grip despite persistent questions over his mental competence.Its true that for as long as Mr. Zuckerberg or the founders of Google, to name a few, display the golden touch, shareholders are not apt to complain much. The problems tend to come when the people in control mess up at the disproportionate expense of other owners. Mr. Zuckerberg, for example, has 54 percent of the votes at Facebook but only a 15 percent financial interest.To the credit of Facebooks board, it said on Thursday that it wanted shareholders to approve a change to the terms of Mr. Zuckerbergs supervoting Class B shares to ensure that if the he stops running Facebook some day, his shares will convert to normal voting ones.The proposal coincides with Facebooks plan to issue a new class of nonvoting stock that will further entrench Mr. Zuckerberg for the time being, which is a less-enlightened governance move. Still, it shows a sensible desire to forestall possible tension with investors down the road.Thats exactly what did not happen at Sika. The Burkard family, which controls the company, struck a deal to sell its holding vehicle to the French giant Saint-Gobain for a hefty $2.8 billion, essentially leaving the other shareholders in the cold. The Burkards 52 percent voting control and 16 percent economic interest mirror Mr. Zuckerbergs position at Facebook.Sikas independent board members and other investors, including the usually below-the-radar Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, have fought the sale since it was unveiled in late 2014. So far, they have been successful in enforcing noncontrolling shareholder protections that the Burkards have argued do not apply to the sale as structured.Moreover, Sikas financial performance has held up. But Saint-Gobain said this week that it was set on the deal despite the lengthy battle. The minority shareholders face twin dangers: If they eventually win, the distraction may by then have damaged Sikas business; and if they lose, the value of their investment will depend entirely on Saint-Gobain. More respect for matters of shareholder democracy could perhaps have avoided the conflict or pointed to a negotiated solution.As when electing people to office, the ballot choices are not always perfect. Gannett, the publishing group whose pursuit of Tribune Publishing has been rebuffed, did not have the right timing to put its own director nominees up for a vote at its targets annual meeting on Thursday. Instead, it asked investors to withhold votes from Tribune Publishings own directors.The certified count is not yet available, but Gannett estimates that five of eight directors received less than 50 percent support from Tribune shareholders if board insiders votes, including a 16.5 percent stake associated with Michael W. Ferro Jr., the chairman, are excluded. Tribune Publishing says all directors had majority support.The competing statements are potentially consistent in mathematical terms, and they allow both sides to claim victory. The withheld votes may serve only as a protest, however, if the Tribune Publishing board keeps placing hurdles in the way of discussions with Gannett and instead pursues a jargon-riddled rebranding as Tronc (with a lowercase t in the companys materials) and what looks like a form-over-substance transfer of its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Yet even votes that do not appear to change outcomes can matter. A group of investors who objected to Michael Dells $25 billion deal to take his computer company private in 2013 won a ruling in a Delaware court this week that will net them nearly an extra 30 percent on the deal price. T. Rowe Price wanted to be part of the lawsuit, but it was excluded because it mistakenly voted in favor of the buyout at the time.The investment manager is figuring out how to reimburse its clients, who but for the error would have been nearly $200 million better off, according to The Wall Street Journal. It is another argument for all investors, whether the pushier sort or traditionally passive ones, to pay close attention to voting. Even second-order effects can cost real money."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Once, when Mitch McConnell was dishing privately to me on the congressional crisis of the moment, I thanked him for his candor and insight.Well, he said in his distinctive drawl, you know Im only telling you this because it helps me.I did know. But it also helped me as a reporter. Still, even given my long experience with the canny Kentucky Republican, I was a little surprised to see this frank admission on the first page of his new memoir, The Long Game:I only talk to the press if its to my advantage, Mr. McConnell wrote, putting it more bluntly than most politicians, even the ones who see it the same way.Mr. McConnell wasnt always so dismissive of the press. On another occasion, he recounted to me how, as a new senator, he was envious as he watched senior colleagues being shadowed and pestered by reporters, making him yearn for the kind of stature where someone would pay him similar attention. Nowadays, Mr. McConnell will stroll purposefully past inquiring reporters without so much as a glance in their direction.The senator has a steely discipline not only when it comes to the news media, but with life itself. His book chronicles his successful struggle against polio as a child, his first neighborhood fistfight, his early obsession with politics, his embrace of civil rights and his slow but steady climb to the position he always coveted and now holds  majority leader of the United States Senate. No White House ambition for him, an attribute that separates him from many of his colleagues.The book also has a few surprises. It reveals that young Mitch McConnell favored sporty cars  a little red Corvair, a 1961 two-seater MG and a 1966 Ford Mustang. He also discloses that he seriously considered not running for re-election in 2014, fearing his could be the defeat that would keep Republicans in the minority. A funny moment occurs when he, as the chairman of the 2001 presidential inaugural, and George W. Bush, the soon-to-be president, briefly panic over the absence of a speakers lectern on the inaugural platform, not realizing it would rise from beneath the stage.Then there is a not-so-surprising revelation to those who have watched Mr. McConnell stubbornly refuse to budge from talking points and doggedly spend day after day on the Senate floor hitting the same rehearsed points.Good politics is repetition, he writes.Mr. McConnell recognizes that he often plays the villain in the narrative of the contemporary Senate  the charisma-challenged, die-hard foe of overhauling the campaign finance system and the king of the filibuster. He finds victories in the arcana of legislating, gloating that he was the first to realize he could thwart campaign finance legislation by blocking once-routine motions to open conference committee negotiations with the House.He sees employing such tactics as an obligation, not an obnoxious stalling maneuver.Filibustering is sometimes presented as an obstructionist tactic by its opponents, but in my view, if legislation as awful as this bill is brought up for consideration, there is a duty to obstruct its passage, he says.On the other hand, Democrats, led by Mr. McConnells archrival, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, were  in Mr. McConnells partisan telling  guilty of ruining the Senate when they used their numbers and procedural skills to stymie Republicans and push President Obamas agenda.It was utterly depressing to watch what Harry Reid had done to the Senate, Mr. McConnell writes. Mr. Reid has since called Mr. McConnell classless for his criticism.Mr. McConnells skill as a political tactician belies his low-key manner. Near the end of his book, he recounts another episode I was involved in that led to one of his more memorable political comments.One reason Republicans were not able to capture control of the Senate in 2010 and 2012 was that hard-right conservative challengers had knocked off establishment-favored candidates in party primaries only to fall to Democrats in the general election.Brought into the Republican leaders office for an interview in March 2014, I asked how he expected the party to fare against another round of threatening primary challenges, including one to his own candidacy in Kentucky.I think were going to crush them everywhere, Mr. McConnell, not typically known for pungent sound bites, said. I dont think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.We proceeded with the interview as I mulled over the comment. I later gave his staff members a heads-up that my article would focus on his bold prediction, a cringe-worthy moment for some of them.Mr. McConnell acknowledges in his book that his staff was uncomfortable, fearing the remark would be seen as a provocative rejection of the Tea Party voters crucial to Republican prospects.Regardless of how my staff felt about it, I believed what Id said, he writes. I had no animosity toward the Tea Party, because we all wanted to achieve the same things. My problem was with the groups who hijacked their agenda for their own profit.And I did it, Mr. McConnell declares proudly about his success in snuffing out threats from the right and finally becoming majority leader after election wins that November.The book ends on that triumphant note, before the rise of Donald J. Trump and the threat his presidential candidacy poses to vulnerable Republican incumbents in the Senate.Mr. McConnell has endorsed Mr. Trump. But he must be concerned that the presumptive nominees brash and unpredictable style could now crush Mr. McConnells own chances of remaining majority leader."}
{"text": "The Cedillo family was already running an hour late, so when the Range Rover stretch limo dropped them off at St. Agatha Church in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Lucero Cedillo and her court of nine chambelanes, the equivalent of groomsmen, dashed out of the car.Lucero led the way, holding the hem of her strapless ball gown in one hand and a matching bouquet of silk garden roses in the other. Her parents, Alberta and Abundio Cedillo, followed. From a distance, the chambelanes could have easily been mistaken for cadets at a police academy graduation, walking in sync wearing black suits with gold aiguillettes around their right shoulders, eyes hidden under peaked hats with gold insignia.The Rev. Silvio A. Ortiz began the quinceaera Roman Catholic Mass by congratulating Lucero, who knelt before him at the altar.He blessed several items, including a porcelain doll, a symbol of Luceros childhood. Applause echoed through mostly empty pews. Then Lucero and her court scurried into the limo, heading for the party, a catered affair for 150 guests at a Greek Orthodox church hall in Bay Ridge.Widely celebrated among Latinos, the quinceaera marks an important milestone in a girls life. Part birthday party, part rite of passage, it symbolizes a girls entrance into womanhood when turning 15, traditionally showcasing her purity and readiness for marriage.But the quinceaera has also been Americanized. And the increasingly elaborate celebrations reflect the changing landscape of Latinos in the United States. In fact, Luceros quinceaera was not, strictly speaking, a quinceaera at all.The celebration, held in February, had many of the traditional trappings: a Mass, a catered bash with live music, and a ceremony in which Luceros transition to womanhood was marked by trading her flats for heels. But Lucero turned 15 a year ago; this was an adapted Sweet 16.I wanted to switch it up, Lucero said. I wanted to keep some of my parents traditions but celebrate at a different age.Its how its done in the United States, she added.The modern quinceaera has become the 21st-century manifestation of what it means to be visible in an American system on your own terms, said Rachel V. Gonzlez-Martin, a folklorist and professor in the Department of Mexican American & Latina/o Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. At the same time, she added, the celebrations create a space that recalls your cultural heritage.Lucero initially felt reluctant to ask her parents for the party, calling it a big waste of money on just one day.Contemporary quinceaeras do tend to have a hefty price tag. Event planners, bakers and caterers, hair stylists, makeup artists and D.J.s have all become part of what will soon be a multibillion-dollar industry, said Mara Bejarano, director of Quinceaera Magazine, a trade publication. When you put the numbers together, its stratospheric, Ms. Bejarano said. The quinceaera business is a monster that keeps on growing.The celebration has spawned specialized retailers, fashion expos, even a reality show, Quiero Mis Quinces, promoting custom parties. Disneys Frozen was among the most popular themes last year, according to quinceaera store owners.Many girls are incorporating decidedly secular and non-Latino elements. They choreograph their traditional dance routines to mainstream pop music instead of waltzes. Lucero opened the dance floor to a Beyonc mix.In 2013, Disney introduced a line of princess-inspired quinceaera dresses, retailing for $300 to $900, and its theme parks offer catered events like the Belle of the Ball package, which starts at $20,000. For an additional $2,500, quinceaeras can make royal entrances in Cinderella-themed horse-drawn carriages.In New York, a quinceaera celebration averages around $10,000, according to Alfonso Caviedes, who owns Fantasy, a special-events dress shop in Jackson Heights, Queens. He offers a layaway system on dresses, which on average cost $600. Some families cannot afford to pay for the dresses up front, Mr. Caviedes said.Rosa Jimenez, who owns Bridal by Rosas in East Harlem, puts the typical cost even higher. I would recommend that families set aside at least $15,000, she said. Its like a wedding.The median household income for Latinos in the United States in 2014 was just over $42,000, according to the Census Bureau, and in New York City the figure is lower. But the high prices dont dissuade families from celebrating.Villa Russo, an event hall in Queens, charges up to $18,700 a night for 275 guests. About 30 quinceaeras a year are held there.Families book custom bakers, like Iva Velazquez in Brooklyn. Ms. Velazquez supplies cakes for 15 quinceaeras a year; her prices can quickly run into the thousands, depending on sugar flowers, ruffles and other intricate details.Some have come to resent such extravagance.Nowadays, families are disrespectful to the church, said Ana Morales, quinceaera coordinator at St. Pauls Church in East Harlem. They bring in these loud musicians, like mariachis, to the quinceaera. The parties in the pews are taking pictures; they are on their cellphones. They seem to have forgotten why they are in church.As a result, St. Pauls has been less inclined to hold such Masses.The quinceaera is a symbol of status and recognition, Ms. Bejarano, the magazine director, said. Families want to celebrate big. But its these strong ties to tradition that distract parents from thinking about how they will pay for their daughters future education.Professor Gonzlez-Martin, of the University of Texas, finds such criticism problematic. People dont tend to question lavish bat mitzvahs, she said. People make the assumptions that Jewish communities are more affluent, whereas Latino communities are stereotyped as impoverished.Its like talking to someone who is on a diet and saying, You shouldnt really eat that, and assuming that they dont know what they are putting in their mouth, she added.Luceros parents, cooks by trade, had been saving for this day for two years. Now both 50 years old, they immigrated to the United States from Mexico in their early 20s.My parents grew up poor, Lucero said. They used to work in the fields. My mom, when she first got to the U.S., she used to work in factories. My mom never had a quince, so she told me, I didnt have a chance, but you do!Of course this is a sacrifice for us, Mr. Cedillo acknowledged. But we dont see it that way. This is tradition. Lucero is a good daughter, and she deserves a party.The quinceaera appeals to both new immigrants and those established for several generations, Professor Gonzlez-Martin said, but for different reasons. For newer arrivals, its about creating a display of affluence, she said. For second- or third-generation Latino Americans, the quinceaera has become a way to reclaim traditions with which theyve lost touch.Staging these elaborate celebrations requires a system of patronage, particularly in Mexican communities, in both Mexico and the United States. The girls parents reach out to relatives and friends to help pay for everything from the limo to the beer.Luceros godparents  12 relatives and friends had been selected  helped cover the celebrations cost: around $13,000.At the church hall in Bay Ridge, Lucero walked slowly between two columns of chambelanes as they held their costume swords. When she arrived at a white throne, two of her godparents handed her a long, bedazzled scepter and placed a crystal tiara atop her carefully curled hair.Mr. Cedillo knelt before his daughter with a silk pillow holding sparkling silver shoes. Lucero lifted her ball gown just enough to let her feet emerge from the layers of fabric. He removed her flats, swapping them for the four-inch heels. The moment, a traditional part of the quinceaera, is supposed to be the first time a young girl wears high heels and dances with a man.This was not quite the case with Lucero. Ive danced since I was 9, she said after the party. This is definitely not the first time Ive put on heels.At nearly 1 a.m., the staff was clearing away empty plates. Luceros parents called up the godparents and handed each a basket of fruit and blankets as thanks for their sponsorship and attendance. The family huddled to say a prayer.Then the lights dimmed and banda  traditional brass-based Mexican music  blasted through the speakers. Luceros father and uncle emerged from the kitchen, carrying a roasted pig on their shoulders.The guests had formed a running circle around the dance floor, and Lucero joined them after changing into a free-flowing cream dress. Soon she was dancing barefoot to her own manic adolescent rhythm, her sparkling high heels clutched tightly at her side."}
{"text": "When Mauricio Gutierrez became chief executive at NRG after his predecessors ouster last year, analysts and investors anticipated that the company would retreat from its money-burning rush into green energy. Instead, they expected it to focus on the conventional power business that had made it a leading  and profitable  supplier in a competitive energy market.But the strategy emerging under Mr. Gutierrez, who released NRGs annual sustainability report on Friday, is less a retreat from green energy than a turn away from a nascent system of decentralized energy production. The focus has returned to large-scale power development, regardless of the fuel source.I think it was important for our employees and the marketplace to recognize that our value proposition is quite straightforward, he said. We generate electricity, and we sell that electricity and other products and services to consumers.The company is still pursuing clean energy solutions, he said, and remains committed to its sustainability goals, among the most aggressive in the industry: to reduce carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2050. NRG began construction on a big community solar project last year, it is developing energy storage in California and it is working to provide renewable energy for companies like Dow Chemical, Unilever and Whole Foods Market.But while it is also converting coal plants to natural gas and experimenting with carbon capture and sequestration for coal, it is reducing investment in some growing markets that the previous chief executive, David Crane, aggressively pursued, like residential solar power, electric vehicle charging and home automation. It was all part of a bid to lead the shifts toward the use of renewable energy and a decentralized power system  one in which customers could generate power in their own homes and feed it back into the electric grid.Mr. Gutierrez, who said he had been driving an electric vehicle for six years, is not exactly undoing all of that, but he is slowing it down. He is selling a majority stake in the electric vehicle charging business. He has also brought the home solar division into NRGs retail electric company, which will sell the customer agreements it originates to two partners once the arrays are installed.Under the new arrangements, NRG will be able to offer electric vehicle charging mainly to its commercial and industrial customers and solar arrays to homeowners, but as part of larger product and service arrangements.Its not entirely opposite but certainly a serious diversion from the path that Mr. Crane set NRG on, said Shayle Kann, the head of GTM Research, which focuses on clean energy industries. He said Mr. Gutierrez had basically pulled back on all the bets that had to do with decentralization and kept everything that has to do with decarbonization.It is an approach tailored to keep a hand in innovation and emerging technologies while steering the company through economically challenging markets, and to align the companys pursuits better with the interests of its investors, Mr. Gutierrez said.I think in the future, renewables will become a bigger part of the industry, and it will become a bigger part of NRG, he said. It would be irresponsible not to embrace renewables, but we have to do it in a way that we create value for our shareholders."}
{"text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.  Eight minutes into the first match of Copa Amrica, the Colombians started to dance.They needed only that little time to notch a precipitous opening goal against the United States, which moved them to perform a coordinated, swaying celebration near the northwest corner flag at Levis Stadium. Their rhythm and spirit barely wavered as they cruised to a 2-0 victory on Friday night.The match opened the South American championship, which is being played in the United States this year to mark its 100th anniversary. It also represented an early setback for the United States and Coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who had said the teams goal in the tournament was to emerge from the group stage. The road ahead is somewhat easier for the Americans, who play Costa Rica on Tuesday and Paraguay on June 11.They were always expected to face a steep challenge from Colombia, the worlds No. 3 team, according to the FIFA rankings.Within the first five minutes, center back Geoff Cameron, facing heavy pressure on the ball, executed a 360-degree evasive dribble to escape trouble near the United States goal, drawing appreciative shouts from the crowd.But Cameron was far less composed three minutes later when defending the corner kick from which Colombia notched its first goal. As the ball floated in from the right corner, Colombia defender Cristin Zapata cut inside and around a screen from the far post, and Cameron, who tried ducking under the screen, was too slow. Zapata, unattended, pounded a leaping volley into the net.The American defenders aggressively aligned themselves high on the field from the start, inviting trouble from Colombias collection of talented attackers. But the damaging plays ended up coming from set pieces.Colombia doubled its lead in the 42nd minute, when the captain James Rodrguez  who came off in the second half with an apparent injury  rolled a penalty kick firmly into the bottom right corner. It was an unfortunate turn of events for the Americans, who had been penalized when a ball crossed from left back Farid Daz struck the outstretched right arm of right back DeAndre Yedlin while his back was turned.The Americans have much room to improve as the tournament takes shape.It was not until the games final half-hour that the United States tested the Colombia defense. In the 60th minute, Colombia midfielder Sebastin Prez splayed his legs out to block Clint Dempseys goal-bound header off the line. Four minutes later, Dempsey forced Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina to make a leaping save when he spun a free kick toward the upper right corner of the goal.For all of Copa Amricas prestige and historical importance, Klinsmann has seemed to most appreciate its value as a testing ground and measuring stick, not only for his team but also for the state of the game in the country.This is a big benchmark: We want to see where we are between two World Cups, Klinsmann said Thursday.The 16-team tournament will unfold in 10 cities across the country over the coming weeks, and American soccer officials will have their eyes on each game as they try to emphasize the countrys suitability to host a future World Cup tournament.In 2010, the United States lost its bid to host the 2022 tournament. It last hosted the tournament in 1994.We want to get as far as we can in the tournament, but we also want to showcase our game to the rest of the world, because down the road, we would love to host the World Cup again, Klinsmann said on Tuesday. This is a huge opportunity for all of us to show everybody outside the U.S. that we are ready for a World Cup.In that regard at least, the game, which drew an announced sellout crowd of 67,439 fans, seemed like a promising start."}
{"text": "Public health officials have long struggled to get Americans to eat less sodium to reduce high blood pressure, and hence cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes. After years of debate, this week the Food and Drug Administration issued guidelines for food manufacturers and restaurants to  reduce the salt they put into their products. Though voluntary, the standards could give consumers more choices.Americans on average consume 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day, equivalent to about 1.5 teaspoons of salt. That is nearly 50 percent more than the 2,300 milligrams that the federal government already recommends. Reducing consumption to that level could save about 500,000 lives and nearly $100 billion in health care costs over a decade, the F.D.A. estimates. The agency is focusing on packaged foods and restaurant meals because more than 70 percent of the sodium people consume is in the food they buy, not added in cooking or at the dining table.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association and other medical groups support the F.D.A.s proposals, citing a trove of scientific studies that find a strong link between salt consumption and high blood pressure. After Britain set voluntary targets similar to what the F.D.A. has proposed, sodium consumption fell 15 percent from 2003 to 2011 and deaths from strokes and heart attacks decreased 42 percent and 40 percent respectively, according to a study published in The British Medical Journal in 2014.There are also studies suggesting that there might be health risks to consuming too little sodium, especially for those without hypertension. But the way to address that problem is for people to add salt to their food after consulting their doctors, not to have everyone eating more.The food industry cites a 2013 Institute of Medicine report to back up its assertion that efforts to lower sodium are misguided. But that report, which evaluated scientific evidence in this area, came out in favor of efforts to lower excessive sodium consumption. Where it departed from previous government recommendations is that the report did not find enough evidence to support lowering sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams a day for certain high-risk groups like people with hypertension, blacks, people older than 51 and diabetics. The F.D.A.s proposal hopes to lower sodium consumption to 3,000 milligrams in two years and to 2,300 in 10 years.By proposing voluntary standards, the agency avoids an all-out confrontation with industry and its supporters in Congress, who have previously sought to block it from taking any action on sodium. The F.D.A. will make its final proposal after reviewing public comments.The food industry is not universally opposed to the F.D.A. Some businesses like Walmart, General Mills, Nestl and Darden, which operates restaurant chains like Olive Garden, have already decided to reduce sodium in their products, which shows that its possible to make food appealing even using less salt."}
{"text": "WHEN I was a child, I had recurring nightmares about wolves  beasts the size of skyscrapers that walked on their hind legs around New York City blocks, chasing and eventually devouring me. My mother says she made the mistake of bringing me to see a live performance of Little Red Riding Hood when I was a toddler, and that the man dressed as the wolf terrified me. I started having the dreams almost immediately after I saw the play, and they lasted into high school; I dont remember when they stopped.It was just a play, just a scary man, yet my young brain was indelibly affected by that one moment.What about all the other moments? The other scary men who arent fictional characters, but real-life terrors in girls and womens lives? The looks that start when weve barely begun puberty, the harassment on the street and online, the violence we survive or are constantly on guard for: What does it do to us?Feminists have worked for decades to properly identify and name trauma. We call those who have been raped or abused survivors. We say that a person is in recovery for an eating disorder. Though they are imperfect, we have resources for victims should they choose to prosecute a perpetrator, go to a shelter or report harassment.But there is still the unexamined cumulative impact of living with sexism. Walking on the street, tweeting, working  just living  while female shapes who we are and who we think we can be.When a high school teacher asked me on a date just a few days after I graduated, I wasnt traumatized. The day that an ex-boyfriend taped a used condom to my dorm-room door, scrawling whore across the dry-erase board, didnt forever damage me. When I receive a rape threat via email, my lifes trajectory does not shift. But it would be silly to believe that who I am today isnt in part created by the distinct combination of those moments.I grew up in Queens, taking the subway to junior high and high school. My commute became a time when it wasnt unusual for a man to grope or flash me. It happened on at least a dozen occasions. I still find myself anxious on the subway. This is not an unreasonable response.Researchers interested in objectification theory  the idea that the way women are looked at and dehumanized affects their mental health and their sense of self  have found that women often change and constrain their behavior because of past experiences with sexism. A study published in 2015 found a link between the misogyny women face and psychological distress.Today, one of the more unpleasant parts of my job writing and talking about feminism is dealing with online harassment  a now-common side effect of writing online while female. Very few days have gone by in the last 10 years when I havent gotten an email, online comment or tweet calling me a bitch or making a violent sexual threat. I go on Instagram during my lunch break to see my friends cute kid pictures, and instead find a comment from a young man I have never met telling me to die.When we talk about gendered trauma, we tend to point to moments of physical danger, harassment or assault. Those are critical to discuss, of course. But we cant leave aside the snowball effect of all types of sexism over a lifetime.For me, its not one particular message or adolescent incident that bothers me; its the weight of years of multiple messages and multiple incidents. Its the knowledge that this will never be just one day, just one message, just one hateful person. Its a chipping away of my sense of safety and my sense of self.I have a 5-year-old daughter now. I want to prepare her for the inevitable leers and slights without making her fearful. I want to help her become the person she is meant to be, the person shed form into without the influence of misogyny.I can tell her what to do if a stranger approaches, teach her about pay inequity or warn her about sexual harassment. But we still have no good way to explain to young women and girls that they need to brace themselves for years of feeling like an object. I dont know how to talk to my daughter about what all of these small moments of feeling diminished add up to, and what they might do to who she is.We are in a powerful cultural moment for feminism. It might be the most powerful one the movement has seen. The mischaracterizations of feminists as man haters or humorless shrews are widely seen as just that, powerhouse celebrities are laying claim to the word, and the country may be on the brink of electing its first female president. When I started speaking on college campuses a decade ago, only a few women in the crowd would identify as feminists. Now when I visit, entire rooms of young men and women enthusiastically embrace the term.It is a much better world for women today, which is precisely why now is the time we can and should talk about feminisms unfinished work. Its important that we see #equalpayday trend, or college activists take on campus assault, but these are largely outward-facing issues.The only advice women seem to get on how to manage their internal lives in a sexist world revolves around changing our behavior: Try not to say sorry or like as much when we talk.The feminism thats popular right now is largely grounded in using optimism and humor to undo the damage that sexism has wrought. Despite the well-worn myth that feminists are obsessed with victimhood, feminism today feels like an unstoppable force of female agency and independence. It is full of positivity and possibility.Even our sad stories, of which there are many, have their moral lessons or silver linings that allow us to buck up, move on, keep working. This is not just a survival technique but an evangelizing strategy, and a good one at that.But maybe were doing ourselves a disservice by working so hard to move past what sexism has done to us, what the impossibility and inevitability of living a dehumanized life feels like. Its a problem that should have a name.This year, in kindergarten, my daughters class was told they were going to put on a performance of The Three Little Pigs. Parts would be given out by teachers, who told the children, You get what you get and you dont get upset. And so my daughter got her part as the first little pig with the straw house. She was unhappy, and when I reiterated the teachers rule about fairness and accepting the roles we are cast in she told me clearly: The only ones I want to be are the pig with the brick house or the wolf. When I asked her why, her answer was simple.Because I want to be one of the ones who doesnt get eaten.Now, her answer may have come from a place of fear  fairy tales feel real at this age  but still I was proud. She does not accept a role as an object, one in which she will be devoured. She wants to live, to be the one doing the eating. I cant say I blame her; thats all I want for myself, too."}
{"text": "Muhammad Ali, the three-time world heavyweight boxing champion who helped define his turbulent times as the most charismatic and controversial sports figure of the 20th century, died on Friday in a Phoenix-area hospital. He was 74.His death was confirmed by Bob Gunnell, a family spokesman. The cause was septic shock, a family spokeswoman said.Ali, who lived near Phoenix, had had Parkinsons disease for more than 30 years. He was admitted to the hospital on Monday with what Mr. Gunnell said was a respiratory problem.Ali was the most thrilling if not the best heavyweight ever, carrying into the ring a physically lyrical, unorthodox boxing style that fused speed, agility and power more seamlessly than that of any fighter before him.But he was more than the sum of his athletic gifts. An agile mind, a buoyant personality, a brash self-confidence and an evolving set of personal convictions fostered a magnetism that the ring alone could not contain. He entertained as much with his mouth as with his fists, narrating his life with a patter of inventive doggerel. (Me! Wheeeeee!)Ali was as polarizing a superstar as the sports world has ever produced  both admired and vilified in the 1960s and 70s for his religious, political and social stances. His refusal to be drafted during the Vietnam War, his rejection of racial integration at the height of the civil rights movement, his conversion from Christianity to Islam and the changing of his slave name, Cassius Clay, to one bestowed by the separatist black sect he joined, the Lost-Found Nation of Islam, were perceived as serious threats by the conservative establishment and noble acts of defiance by the liberal opposition.Loved or hated, he remained for 50 years one of the most recognizable people on the planet.In later life Ali became something of a secular saint, a legend in soft focus. He was respected for having sacrificed more than three years of his boxing prime and untold millions of dollars for his antiwar principles after being banished from the ring; he was extolled for his un-self-conscious gallantry in the face of incurable illness, and he was beloved for his accommodating sweetness in public.In 1996, he was trembling and nearly mute as he lit the Olympic caldron in Atlanta.That passive image was far removed from the exuberant, talkative, vainglorious 22-year-old who bounded out of Louisville, Ky., and onto the world stage in 1964 with an upset victory over Sonny Liston to become the world champion. The press called him the Louisville Lip. He called himself the Greatest.Ali also proved to be a shape-shifter  a public figure who kept reinventing his persona.As a bubbly teenage gold medalist at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, he parroted Americas Cold War line, lecturing a Soviet reporter about the superiority of the United States. But he became a critic of his country and a government target in 1966 with his declaration I aint got nothing against them Vietcong.He lived a lot of lives for a lot of people, said the comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory. He was able to tell white folks for us to go to hell.But Ali had his hypocrisies, or at least inconsistencies. How could he consider himself a race man yet mock the skin color, hair and features of other African-Americans, most notably Joe Frazier, his rival and opponent in three classic matches? Ali called him the gorilla, and long afterward Frazier continued to express hurt and bitterness.If there was a supertitle to Alis operatic life, it was this: I dont have to be who you want me to be; Im free to be who I want. He made that statement the morning after he won his first heavyweight title. It informed every aspect of his life, including the way he boxed.The traditionalist fight crowd was appalled by his style; he kept his hands too low, the critics said, and instead of allowing punches to slip past his head by bobbing and weaving, he leaned back from them.Eventually his approach prevailed. Over 21 years, he won 56 fights and lost five. His Ali Shuffle may have been pure showboating, but the rope-a-dope  in which he rested on the rings ropes and let an opponent punch himself out  was the stratagem that won the Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman in 1974, the fight in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in which he regained his title.His personal life was paradoxical. Ali belonged to a sect that emphasized strong families, a subject on which he lectured, yet he had dalliances as casual as autograph sessions. A brief first marriage to Sonji Roi ended in divorce after she refused to dress and behave as a proper Nation wife. (She died in 2005.) While married to Belinda Boyd, his second wife, Ali traveled openly with Veronica Porche, whom he later married. That marriage, too, ended in divorce.Ali was politically and socially idiosyncratic as well. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the television interviewer David Frost asked him if he considered Al Qaeda and the Taliban evil. He replied that terrorism was wrong but that he had to dodge questions like that because I have people who love me. He said he had businesses around the country and an image to consider.As a spokesman for the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum dedicated to respect, hope and understanding, which opened in his hometown, Louisville, in 2005, he was known to interrupt a fund-raising meeting with an ethnic joke. In one he said: If a black man, a Mexican and a Puerto Rican are sitting in the back of a car, whos driving? Give up? The po-lice.But Ali had generated so much good will by then that there was little he could say or do that would change the publics perception of him.We forgive Muhammad Ali his excesses, an Ali biographer, Dave Kindred, wrote, because we see in him the child in us, and if he is foolish or cruel, if he is arrogant, if he is outrageously in love with his reflection, we forgive him because we no more can condemn him than condemn a rainbow for dissolving into the dark. Rainbows are born of thunderstorms, and Muhammad Ali is both.Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. was born in Louisville on Jan. 17, 1942, into a family of strivers that included teachers, musicians and craftsmen. Some of them traced their ancestry to Henry Clay, the 19th-century representative, senator and secretary of state, and his cousin Cassius Marcellus Clay, a noted abolitionist.Alis mother, Odessa, was a cook and a house cleaner, his father a sign painter and a church muralist who blamed discrimination for his failure to become a recognized artist. Violent and often drunk, Clay Sr. filled the heads of Cassius and his younger brother, Rudolph (later Rahman Ali), with the teachings of the 20th-century black separatist Marcus Garvey and a refrain that would become Alis  I am the greatest.Beyond his fathers teachings, Ali traced his racial and political identity to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a black 14-year-old from Chicago who was believed to have flirted with a white woman on a visit to Mississippi. Clay was about the same age as Till, and the photographs of the brutalized dead youth haunted him, he said.Cassius started to box at 12, after his new $60 red Schwinn bicycle was stolen off a downtown street. He reported the theft to Joe Martin, a police officer who ran a boxing gym. When Cassius boasted what he would do to the thief when he caught him, Martin suggested that he first learn how to punch properly.Cassius was quick, dedicated and gifted at publicizing a youth boxing show, Tomorrows Champions, on local television. He was soon its star.For all his ambition and willingness to work hard, education  public and segregated  eluded him. The only subjects in which he received satisfactory grades were art and gym, his high school reported years later. Already an amateur boxing champion, he graduated 376th in a class of 391. He was never taught to read properly; years later he confided that he had never read a book, neither the ones on which he collaborated nor even the Quran, although he said he had reread certain passages dozens of times. He memorized his poems and speeches, laboriously printing them out over and over.In boxing he found boundaries, discipline and stable guidance. Martin, who was white, trained him for six years, although historical revisionism later gave more credit to Fred Stoner, a black trainer in the Smoketown neighborhood. It was Martin who persuaded Clay to gamble your life and go to Rome with the 1960 Olympic team despite his almost pathological fear of flying.Clay won the Olympic light-heavyweight title and came home a professional contender. In Rome, Clay was everything the sports diplomats could have hoped for  a handsome, charismatic and black glad-hander. When a Russian reporter asked him about racial prejudice, Clay ordered him to tell your readers we got qualified people working on that, and Im not worried about the outcome.To me, the U.S.A. is still the best country in the world, counting yours, he added. It may be hard to get something to eat sometimes, but anyhow I aint fighting alligators and living in a mud hut.Ali would later cringe at that quotation, especially when journalists harked back to it as proof that a merry man-child had been misguided into becoming a hateful militant.Of course, after the Rome Games, few journalists followed Clay home to Louisville, where he was publicly referred to as the Olympic nigger and denied service at many downtown restaurants. After one such rejection, the story goes, he hurled his gold medal into the Ohio River. But Clay, and later Ali, gave different accounts of that act, and according to Thomas Hauser, author of the oral history Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times, Clay had simply lost the medal.Clay turned professional by signing a six-year contract with 11 local white millionaires. (They got the complexions and connections to give me good directions, he said.) The so-called Louisville Sponsoring Group supported him while he was groomed by Angelo Dundee, a top trainer, in Miami.At a mosque there, Clay was introduced to the Nation of Islam, known to the news media as Black Muslims. Elijah Muhammad, the groups leader, taught that white people were devils genetically created by an evil scientist. On Allahs chosen day of retribution, the Mother of Planes would bomb all but the righteous, and the righteous would be spirited away.Years later, after leaving the group and converting to orthodox Islam, Ali gave the Nation of Islam credit for offering African-Americans a black-is-beautiful message at a time of low self-esteem and persecution. Color doesnt make a man a devil, he said. Its the heart and soul and mind that count. Whats on the outside is only decoration.Clay enjoyed early success against prudently chosen opponents. His outrageous predictions, usually in rhyme  This is no jive, Cooper will go in five  put off many older sportswriters, especially since most of the predictions came true. (His fight against the Englishman Henry Cooper did end in the fifth round at Wembley Stadium in 1963, although Cooper, who had knocked Clay down in the fourth, did not go down.) The reporters beau ideal of a boxer was the laconic Joe Louis. But they still wrote about Clay. Younger sportswriters, raised in an age of Andy Warhol, happenings and the put on, were delighted by the hype and by Clays friendly accessibility.In 1963, at 21, after only 15 professional fights, he was on the cover of Time magazine. The winking quality of the prose  Cassius Clay is Hercules, struggling through the twelve labors. He is Jason, chasing the Golden Fleece  reinforced the assumption that he was just another boxer being sacrificed to the box offices lust for fresh meat. It was feared he would be seriously injured by the baleful slugger Liston, a 7-to-1 betting favorite to retain his title in Miami Beach, Fla., on Feb. 25, 1964.But Clay was joyously comic. Encouraged by his assistant trainer and spiritual adviser, Drew Brown, known as Bundini, Clay mocked Liston as the big ugly bear and chanted a battle cry: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, rumble, young man, rumble.The Beatles, on their first American tour, were in town and showed up for a photo op at Clays training gym. Malcolm X, a leading minister for the Nation of Islam and a worrisome presence to many white Americans, was there, too, with his family members as guests of Clay, whom they saw as a big brother.To the shock of the crowd, Clay, taller and broader than Liston at 6 feet 3 inches and 210 pounds and much faster, took immediate control of the fight. He danced away from Listons vaunted left hook and peppered his face with jabs, opening a cut over his left eye. Clay was in trouble only once. Just before the start of the fifth round, his eyes began to sting. It was liniment, but he suspected poison. Dundee had to push him into the ring. Two rounds later, Liston, slumped on his stool, his left arm hanging uselessly, gave up. He had torn muscles swinging at Clay in vain.Clay, the new champion, capered along the ring apron, shouting at the press: Eat your words! I shook up the world! Im king of the world!(More than a year later, in May 1965, he would retain his crown in lightning-quick fashion in a rematch with Liston in Lewiston, Me. Within two minutes of the first round, Ali threw what became known as the phantom punch, sending Liston sprawling and resulting in a disputed decision to end the fight.)The morning after the Miami Beach fight, a calm Clay affirmed his rumored membership in the Nation of Islam. He would be Cassius X. (A few weeks later he became Muhammad Ali, which he said meant Worthy of all praise most high.) That day he harangued his audience with a preview of what would, over the next few years, become a series of longer and more detailed lectures about religion and race. This one was about, as he put it, staying with your own kind.In the jungle, lions are with lions and tigers with tigers, he said. I dont want to go where Im not wanted.The only prominent leader to send Ali a telegram of congratulations was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.I remember when Ali joined the Nation of Islam, Julian Bond, the civil rights activist and politician, once said. The act of joining was not something many of us particularly liked. But the notion hed do it  that hed jump out there, join this group that was so despised by mainstream America, and be proud of it  sent a little thrill through you.The thrills gave way to darker thoughts. After Malcolm X left the Nation and was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965, by members of the group, there was talk that Ali had been tacitly complicit. Jack Newfield, a political journalist with an interest in boxing, wrote, If Ali, as the new heavyweight champion, had remained loyal to his mentor, and continued to lend his public support to Malcolm, history might have gone in a different direction.On Feb. 17, 1966, a day already roiled by the Senates televised hearings on the war in Vietnam, Ali learned that he had been reclassified 1A by his Louisville selective service board. He had originally been disqualified by a substandard score on a mental aptitude test. But a subsequent lowering of criteria made him eligible to go to war. The timing, however, was suspicious to some; the contract with the Louisville millionaires had run out, and Nation members were taking over as Alis managers and promoters.Why me? Ali said when reporters swarmed around his rented Miami cottage to ask about his new draft status. I buy a lot of bullets, at least three jet bombers a year, and pay the salary of 50,000 fighting men with the money they take from me after my fights.But as the reporters continued to press him with questions about the war, the geography of Asia and his thoughts about killing Vietcong, he snapped, I aint got nothing against them Vietcong.The remark was front-page news around the world. In America, the news medias response was mostly unfavorable, if not hostile. The sports columnist Red Smith of The New York Herald Tribune wrote, Squealing over the possibility that the military may call him up, Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war.Most of the press refused to refer to Ali by his new name. When two black contenders, Floyd Patterson and Ernie Terrell, insisted on calling him Cassius Clay, Ali taunted them in the ring as he delivered savage beatings.On April 28, 1967, Ali refused to be drafted and requested conscientious-objector status. He was immediately stripped of his title by boxing commissions around the country. Several months later he was convicted of draft evasion, a verdict he appealed. He did not fight again until he was almost 29, losing three and a half years of his athletic prime.They were years of personal and intellectual growth, however, as Ali supported himself on the college lecture circuit, offering medleys of Muslim dogma and boxing verse. In the question-and-answer sessions that followed, Ali was forced to explain his religion, his Vietnam stand and his opposition (unpopular on most campuses) to marijuana and interracial dating. Now the onliest boxer in history that people asked questions like a senator developed coherent answers.During his exile from the ring, Ali starred in a short-lived Broadway musical, Buck White, one of several commercial ventures. There was a fast-food chain called Champburger and a mock movie fight with the popular former champion Rocky Marciano in which Ali outboxed the slugger until being knocked out himself in the final round. The broadcaster Howard Cosell, one of Alis most steadfast supporters in the news media, was responsible for keeping him on television, both as an interview subject and as a commentator on boxing matches.As Alis draft-evasion case made its way to the United States Supreme Court, he returned to the ring on Oct. 26, 1970, through the efforts of black politicians in Atlanta. The fight, which ended with a quick knockout of the white contender Jerry Quarry, was only a tuneup for Alis anticipated showdown with Frazier, the new champion. But it was a night of glamour and history as Coretta Scott King, Bill Cosby, Diana Ross, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sidney Poitier turned out to honor Ali. The Rev. Ralph Abernathy presented him with the annual Dr. King award, calling him the March on Washington all in two fists.The Fight, as the Madison Square Garden bout with Frazier on March 8, 1971, was billed, lived up to expectations as an epic match. With Norman Mailer ringside taking notes for a book and Frank Sinatra shooting pictures for Life magazine, Ali stood toe to toe with Frazier and slugged it out as if determined to prove that he had heart, that he could stand up to punishment. Frazier won a 15-round decision. Both men suffered noticeable physical damage.To Alis boosters, the money he had lost standing up for his principles and the beating he had taken from Frazier proved his sincerity. To his critics, the bloody redemption meant he had finally grown up. The Supreme Court also took a positive view. On June 28, 1971, it unanimously reversed a lower court decision and granted Ali his conscientious-objector status.It was assumed now that Alis time had passed and that he would become a high-grade opponent, the fighter to beat for those establishing themselves. But his time had returned. Although he was slower, his artistry was even more refined. He didnt have fights, wrote Jim Murray of The Los Angeles Times, he gave recitals.He won 13 of his next 14 fights, including a rematch with Frazier, who had lost his title to George Foreman, a bigger, more frightening version of Liston.Ali was the underdog, smaller and seven years older than Foreman, when they met on Oct. 30, 1974, in Zaire, then ruled by Mobutu Sese Seko. Each fighter was guaranteed $5 million, an extraordinary sum at the time. The fight also launched the career of the promoter Don King and was the subject of Leon Gasts documentary When We Were Kings, which was released more than 20 years later. (Ali attended a special screening, along with hip-hop performances, at Radio City Music Hall.) The film won a 1997 Academy Award.Ali reveled in the African setting, repeating an aphorism he had heard from Brown, his assistant trainer: The world is a black shirt with a few white buttons.As the fight progressed, the crowd chanted, Ali, bomaye! (Ali, kill him!), first out of concern as Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed Foremans sledgehammer blows on his arms and shoulders, and then in mounting excitement as Foreman wore himself out. In the eighth round, in a blur of punches, Ali knocked out Foreman to regain the title. He leaned down to reporters and said, What did I tell you?On Dec. 10, 1974, Ali was invited to the White House for the first time, by President Gerald R. Ford, an occasion that signified not only a turning point in the countrys embrace of Ali but also a return of the Lip. Ali told the president, You made a big mistake letting me come because now Im going after your job.Ali successfully defended his title 10 times over the next three years, at increasing physical cost. He knocked out Frazier in their third match, the so-called Thrilla in Manila in 1975, but the punishment of their 14 rounds, Ali said, felt close to dying.In 1978 he lost and then regained his title in fights with Leon Spinks. Alis longtime ring doctor, Ferdie Pacheco, urged him to quit, noting the slowing of his reflexes and the slurring of his speech as symptoms of damage. Ali refused. In 1980, he was battered in a loss to the champion Larry Holmes. A year later, he fought for the last time, losing to the journeyman Trevor Berbick in the Bahamas.Ali was soon told that he had Parkinsons syndrome. Several doctors have speculated that it was brought on by too many punches to the head. The diagnosis was later changed to Parkinsons disease, according to his wife, Lonnie. She said it had been brought on by Alis exposure to pesticides and other toxic chemicals at his training camp in Deer Lake, Pa.After retiring from the ring, Ali made speeches emphasizing spirituality, peace and tolerance, and undertook quasi-diplomatic missions to Africa and Iraq. Even as he lost mobility and speech, he traveled often from his home in Berrien Springs, Mich. Product and corporate endorsements brought him closer to the show me the money sensibilities of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, the heirs to his global celebrity.In 1999, Ali became the first boxer on a Wheaties box. On Dec. 31 that year, he rang out the millennium at the New York Stock Exchange. In 2003, a $7,500 art book celebrating his life was published. His life was the subject of a television movie and a feature film directed by Michael Mann, with Will Smith as Ali. (Both productions sanitized his early religious and political viewpoints.) The same licensing firm that owned most of Elvis Presleys image purchased rights to Alis.Thomas Hauser, his biographer, decried the new commercialism surrounding Ali and the rounding off the rough edges of his journey. In a book of essays published in 2005, The Lost Legacy of Muhammad Ali, Hauser wrote, We should cherish the memory of Ali as a warrior and as a gleaming symbol of defiance against an unjust social order when he was young.In 2005, calling him the greatest boxer of all time, President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Freedom to Ali in a White House ceremony.In recent years, Parkinsons disease and spinal stenosis, which required surgery, limited Alis mobility and ability to communicate. He spent most of his time at his home in Paradise Valley, Ariz., often watching Western movies and old black-and-white TV shows. He ventured out mostly for physical therapy, movies and concerts. He rarely did TV interviews, his wife said, because he no longer liked the way he looked on camera.But he loved the adoration of crowds, she said. Even though he became vulnerable in ways he couldnt control, he never lost his childlike innocence, his sunny, positive nature. Jokes and pranks and magic tricks. He wanted to entertain people, to make them happy."}
{"text": "TOKYO  A 7-year-old Japanese boy who disappeared nearly a week ago after his parents left him on the side of a mountain road to discipline him was found unharmed on Friday, the Japanese authorities said.The boy, Yamato Tanooka, wandered onto a military base about three miles from where he was left on Saturday on the northern island of Hokkaido. He was found early Friday morning by soldiers on a training exercise, exhausted but apparently uninjured, the local police said.The boys parents have faced harsh public criticism over the case, which has been covered intensively by the Japanese news media since his disappearance.Im full of gratitude. From now on, Im going to take better care of him as he grows up, Yamatos father, Takayuki Tanooka, 44, said in comments on NHK, the national broadcaster. Some 200 police officers and volunteer rescue workers had been searching for the boy.The parents initially told the police that their son had become separated from them while they were picking wild vegetables in the mountains. But they later changed their story, saying they had left their son on the side of the road as punishment for throwing stones at cars and people while they were on an outing.They said they had driven off in their car, intending to scare him. But when they went back a short time later, the boy was gone.The police have not indicated whether they intend to pursue criminal charges against the parents.Three soldiers from the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force found the boy in a cabin on the remote wooded military base on Friday morning, said Hiroki Komori, a spokesman for the 11th Brigade of the Northern Army, which trains there. The soldiers had ducked into the cabin to avoid a rain shower, Mr. Komori said.The soldiers gave the boy rice balls and tea from a canteen, Mr. Komori said. He was taken to Hakodate Municipal Hospital by ambulance.Japanese news reports said the boy had probably been sheltering for days in the cabin. He told the authorities that he had found his way to the area soon after his parents left him and had been subsisting only on water from a nearby stream, reports said.Commentary about the case on social media has been overwhelmingly critical toward the parents. This isnt discipline, its child abuse, Kenichiro Mogi, a well-known neurologist, author and television personality, wrote on Twitter on Monday.Its the boys father who has learned the big lesson, another social media user said after he was found on Friday.A few said the parents had simply mishandled an otherwise acceptable form of punishment. Some said they had been subjected to the same treatment from their own parents after misbehaving as children.I understand, I really do, but they should at least have kept an eye on him from behind some trees, one Twitter post from Sunday read. There are bears in Hokkaido."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Hillary Clinton on Thursday delivered her most robust attack yet on her likely Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, declaring him temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief. But although her campaign had described the speech as a major foreign policy address, Mrs. Clinton spent more time ridiculing and dismantling Mr. Trumps statements than she did elucidating her positions. Here are a few key issues she did not discuss.In October 2015, Mrs. Clinton told a Boston television station, I personally would be advocating now for a no-fly zone and humanitarian corridors to try to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air. She repeated that call during a Democratic debate two months later. But President Obama has resisted such a move. The Pentagon is also leery: Military commanders warn that it would require substantial numbers of American ground forces and invite a deadly confrontation with the Syrians and the Russians. She has not fleshed out the proposal since then.Last fall, Mrs. Clinton said, I am in the category of people who wanted to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilizing of Ukraine. Her aides said she supported a proposal to funnel defensive weapons, like Javelin antitank missiles, to Ukrainian troops. Mr. Obama argued that this would escalate a showdown with Russia  one that Mr. Putin would inevitably win, given Ukraines proximity, and its greater strategic value, to Russia. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton made no mention of steps she would take to counter Mr. Putins aggression, saying only that she had gone toe to toe with Moscow as secretary of state.Mrs. Clinton played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Obama to take part in the 2011 NATO air campaign that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. She has expressed no regrets about the intervention, even after Libya fell into chaos and four Americans were killed in the attack on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi. Her aides attribute the countrys woes to the unwillingness of its new leaders to accept a peacekeeping force. But Mrs. Clinton has said little about how the United States can help put Libya back together, other than calling for patient engagement. On Thursday, she left Libya off the list of knotty issues she and Mr. Obama had confronted.After the terrorist attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, Mrs. Clinton called for an intensification and acceleration of Mr. Obamas military campaign against the Islamic State. Her plan, unveiled in November at the Council on Foreign Relations, would consist of heavier airstrikes against Islamic State fighters, the possible deployment of additional Special Forces troops to help Arab and Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq, and efforts to counter recruitment by the terrorist group over social media. On Thursday, she repeated that list, saying, That, in a nutshell, is my plan for defeating ISIS. She offered no further details.Mrs. Clinton excoriated Mr. Trump for, as she put it, gleefully praising the North Korean dictator for his brutal consolidation of power. She also talked about the importance of Americas allies in confronting the threat from Pyongyang over its nuclear program. After Mr. Trump said recently that he would be open to direct talks with Mr. Kim, Mrs. Clintons aides were sensitive to the suggestion that she had not been open to diplomacy. She wasnt averse to testing diplomacy with the North, Jake Sullivan, her senior policy adviser, said in an interview. She did have a cleareyed view of what was possible. If elected, Mrs. Clinton appears likely to make full use of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council, including so-called secondary sanctions, which the United States can impose on entities that do business with North Korea. But she did not delve into those details on Thursday, nor did she discuss a North Korea policy that experts say is badly in need of review."}
{"text": "SUNDAY PUZZLE  The total number of puzzle themes can sometimes seem limited in scope, but there is always someone who is willing to give an oft-repeated theme a twist. Today, Tom McCoy offers us such a puzzle.Weve all seen the word that can be inserted before or after another to make a whole new phrase theme. Mr. McCoy engagingly turns that theme convention on its head and the result is a very clever Sunday outing.Very simply, the answers youd normally put in the grid are in the clues, and the instructions youd need to get to those answers are the entries today. Dont panic, though: The crossings are kind and the theme is eminently gettable. And remember what Ive said about themes living anywhere in a puzzle. Finding them is part of the fun.The theme clues start with Where you can find  and end with two words that appear to have nothing to do with the ultimate entry. But they do. At 23A, for example, you have the clue Where you can find  jacket or yourself? and the answer is the common phrase FOLLOWING SUIT. All you have to do is follow the instruction youve been given.What instructions, you ask? The words jacket and yourself can both FOLLOW the word SUIT (SUIT jacket and SUIT yourself).Heres a breakdown of those theme entries and how to parse them:23A: FOLLOWING SUIT = SUIT jacket and SUIT yourself31A: BEFORE LONG = Go LONG and so LONG37A: CLOSE TO HOME = Anybody HOME and HOME cooking65A: BETWEEN YOU AND ME = YOU got ME and YOU tell ME93A: AHEAD OF TIME = Two TIME and face TIME95A: POST OFFICE = OFFICE building and OFFICE hours113A: NEXT TO NOTHING = Thats NOTHING and NOTHING specialOutside of the theme, theres some really nice stuff here, like JUST NOW (which always makes me laugh, because it has a totally different meaning in South Africa), WHOOPEE, YOOHOO, FOOTSTEP, MASALA, I CAN SEE, POSTERN, TOODLEOO, JAWBONE, NICETY, MOVIE NIGHT, AND SO FORTH, HECKLE, THATS THAT, as well as the Aww-inspiring twins ADORABLE and CUTESY. 20As Ones with good poker faces? does not, obviously, refer to playing cards. RHINOS have good poker faces because of their horns. 69As Result of hitting the bar? is also wordplay. One result of hitting the bar would be public intoxication, but if you think in terms of keyboards, another result of hitting the bar would be a SPACE. I originally thought the clue for 71A was a typo and that the quote GRIEF is the price we pay for love should be attributed to Queen Elizabeth I, considering her unfortunate love life. But the quote is attributed at least in part to the current monarch, and it was uttered after the 2001 loss of her best friend. 91As Contraction missing a V is a tricky one, because youre not given any category to think about. However, if youve been solving for a while and have seen the poetic contraction EEN, which should really be EEN, you would recognize it as even or the shortened version of evening. Ditto for 68D. 2Ds WHOS your daddy?: Ive got nothing. It probably refers to a lost child. [If you say so. Ed.] 7Ds BONA Nox (Mozart title meaning good night): Im thankful for that parenthetical help, arent you? Dont forget to read the entire clue. Ditto for 30Ds STO Lat. 42Ds Setting for a watch? is really sneaky. Were not talking about time at all here. Were talking about watching a movie on MOVIE NIGHT. Im not crazy about clues like 97Ds Too big for ones britches, say? for OBESE because it gets into fat-shaming. There are a lot of ways to clue a word like OBESE without seeming like the clue is making a joke at someones expense.Crossword themes tend to work best when they are as symmetric and consistent as possible. For this puzzle, then, I put the lone between theme answer in the middle of the grid, while the top and bottom halves both have one before answer, one after answer and one close to answer.This theme has been sitting in my idea notebook for a while, so I was glad to finally implement it.I hope you enjoy!Enjoy we did, Mr. McCoy. Thanks for giving us another way to look at a veteran theme.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "OKINAWA, Japan  Memorial Day weekend is normally party time on Gate Street, a seedy strip of bars and clubs outside a giant United States Air Force base here.During this years holiday, though, Gate Street was all but deserted, its customers  young Americans from the military installations that blanket much of this southern Japanese island  barred by their superiors from partying in public.The reason: a recent murder that has angered Okinawans and damaged relations between Tokyo and Washington.The killing of the 20-year-old Okinawan woman, whose body was found decomposing in a suitcase last month, has been linked to an American military contractor who is a Marine veteran. The outcry after the man, Kenneth Franklin Shinzato, was arrested on May 19 has been so strong that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe protested publicly to President Obama during the presidents recent trip to Japan.The unusual rebuke over a criminal case by another head of state marred a visit that was otherwise carefully choreographed to celebrate friendly relations and included Mr. Obamas historic visit to Hiroshima. Mr. Abe, at a joint news conference, professed shock over the murder and asked Mr. Obama to understand the feelings of the Japanese people and strengthen military discipline.Mr. Shinzato has not yet been formally charged, a decision that can take weeks in Japan. His lawyer has declined to comment.Okinawans have complained for years about violence, noise and other problems associated with American bases. But this murder case is threatening to ratchet up opposition to the United States large military presence, which dates to the end of World War II.Weve heard apologies and promises of prevention hundreds of times, for decades, but it hasnt had any effect, said Okinawas governor, Takeshi Onaga. Okinawans still bitterly remember a 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl involving two Marines and a Navy sailor, which led to protests, as well as more recent episodes.Mr. Onaga was once the leader of the local chapter of Mr. Abes right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, but he has broken with the prime minister over the issue of Americas military footprint, which he wants greatly reduced. Half of the 50,000 American military personnel in Japan are stationed here, and United States facilities take up one-fifth of Okinawan land.Anger is increasingly reflected in the politics of Okinawa, where local elections are being held on Sunday. Late last month, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly passed a resolution demanding that all United States Marines be removed from the island, its strongest censure of the American military to date. Local elections are being held on Sunday.The spot where the womans body was found, in woods beside a golf course, has been covered with hundreds of offerings of flowers, food and drink.The furor is erupting at a sensitive time for Okinawa, and for Japan, and the growing wealth and power of China has sharpened the debate about the islands future.Mr. Abe is seeking to reinforce its position as a military outpost by building a new but widely contested base for the Marines and expanding Japans own military assets. Japans Self-Defense Forces began operating a sophisticated new radar station this year on the tiny island of Yonaguni, part of Okinawa Prefecture, to monitor Chinese naval activity in the East China Sea.But at the same time, Asias new prosperity is opening up other possibilities.These were on display 40 minutes south of Gate Street in Naha, Okinawas capital, where tourists from Taiwan, China and South Korea thronged the citys shopping streets and hotels. Foreign tourism was up 70 percent last year. Airlines are adding new international flights to the semitropical island, while more Asian cruise lines are docking at Nahas port.Okinawa used to be an object of pity in Japan, but now its a brand, said Hiroshi Meguro, a former research fellow at the Institute of Okinawan Studies at Hosei University in Tokyo.The bases never made Okinawans rich: The prefecture has the lowest per-capita income in Japan, one-third below the national average. Now, dependence on them is in decline, Mr. Meguro said, and with it Okinawans tolerance for the problems they bring.Some in Okinawa would like to follow the example of the Philippines, which pushed out the American military in the early 1990s and redeveloped a major Navy base, at Subic Bay, into a lucrative resort destination.When it comes to the economy and tourism, its Welcome, China, Mr. Meguro said. Of course, it glosses over the fact that the Philippines has started to invite American forces back because its being menaced by China.Hiroji Yamashiro, a retired local civil servant, said that he wanted Okinawa to become a tourist center, but that the bases stood in the way. He spends most days protesting outside the gates of Camp Schwab, a Marine armory and firing range in the north that the Japanese and American governments want to radically expand by filling in a bay and building a pair of aircraft runways.The plan illustrates the complexities facing Japanese and American policy makers. The expanded base is intended to replace another facility to the south, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which sits in the middle of a crowded city and has been the object of some of the most vigorous complaints by Okinawans. A Marine helicopter crashed just outside its walls in 2004, damaging a university.Tokyo and Washington agreed two decades ago to shift much of Futenmas equipment and personnel to Schwab. But local opposition has blocked the move, and work on the project was frozen before it really began.On a boat ride around the bay, Mr. Yamashiro pointed to nearly uninterrupted beaches surrounding Camp Schwab. A couple of young men with military haircuts and snorkels had a small island inside its perimeter to themselves. Mr. Yamashiro said they should be replaced by far larger numbers of Chinese and Taiwanese tourists.The future is opening up in front of us, but the Japanese government is blocking it, Mr. Yamashiro said.Successive Japanese and American governments have struggled to find a satisfactory solution to the Futenma issue. Deadlines to start construction at Schwab have come and gone, holding up a broader reorganization of United States forces in Japan that would move some troops off Okinawa to Guam. But critics of the long-stalled plan, including Mr. Onaga, the governor, are holding out for a more drastic drawdown.Okinawa is isolated, physically and in peoples minds, said Susumu Inamine, the mayor of Nago, where Camp Schwab is situated.He does not want the base expanded, and has rebuffed offers of subsidies from the government in Tokyo that are contingent on his accepting the plan. For the government, its a faraway place where what happens doesnt impose any pain on the mainland, he said.The local authorities have little say over base policy. But they can hold up projects with tactics like withholding construction permits. The prefectural government recently fought Tokyo to a standstill in court over the expansion plan. A judge persuaded both sides to return to the negotiating table in March, but neither has shown signs of retreating.Well keep delaying until 2020, then 2030, Mr. Inamine said. The question is, can the U.S. wait that long before looking for another option?Many Americans in Okinawa feel the military has been unfairly demonized. They point to crime statistics that show United States personnel are arrested at lower rates than locals. Still, some sympathize with Okinawans sense that the United States occupation of their island, which formally concluded in 1972, has never truly ended.Part of the problem is that the American militarys presence extends across the whole island, said a retired member of the Air Force who has lived in Japan for three decades and was stationed at various bases across Japan. Today, he manages several businesses in Okinawa, including one that does contract work for the military, and like other Americans with base connections, he requested anonymity to speak.Michio Sakima, the owner of the Sakima Art Museum next to the Futenma base, said Okinawans anger over the recent killing reflected pent-up political frustration as much as the brutal nature of the crime.His museum shares a fence with the base, and Futenmas closing would relieve Mr. Sakima of the noise of jets and helicopters. But he opposes moving the Marines to Camp Schwab, he said, on the grounds that it would entrench the military presence on the island.We are still a colony, he said. When a serious crime happens, thats when our real feelings come out."}
{"text": "Dave Swarbrick, a fiddler who electrified the British folk tradition as a member of the band Fairport Convention, died on Friday. He was 75.His death was announced on his website. The announcement did not say where he died or specify the cause, but he had emphysema for many years.Mr. Swarbrick and Fairport Convention were prime movers in trad-rock, which connected the 1960s ferment of folk-rock and psychedelia to a deep British heritage of storytelling ballads and nimble dance tunes. His fiddle playing had the deliberately rough-hewed sound of rural tradition; his tone could be sweet or scratchy, his phrases songful and melancholy or propulsive and gnarled with ornamental turns and quavers.He also sang, wrote songs and played viola, mandolin, mandola and guitar.Mr. Swarbrick was born in New Malden, Surrey, near London, on April 5, 1941. He learned to play fiddle as a child in Yorkshire. In the 1950s, the pianist Beryl Marriott heard him in a skiffle band and invited him to join her traditional Gaelic band, beginning a long association.By the early 1960s Mr. Swarbrick was being heard on the BBC series Radio Ballads, a mixture of oral history and music produced by the songwriter Ewan MacColl; he also recorded with Mr. MacColl, Peggy Seeger and other folk musicians.He appeared on seven albums with the Ian Campbell Folk Group in the early 1960s and in 1965 began recording with Martin Carthy, a leader of Britains folk revival. Mr. Swarbrick released his first solo album, Rags, Reels and Airs, in 1967.Fairport Convention, which had started as a folk-rock group strongly influenced by American styles, brought in Mr. Swarbrick as a sideman on the 1969 album Unhalfbricking. The Fairport version of the traditional song A Sailors Life emerged as an 11-minute maelstrom, with Mr. Swarbricks fiddle rising alongside Richard Thompsons lead guitar, bringing echoes of past generations into the jam.For a pickup to amplify his instrument, Mr. Swarbrick recounted in the 2011 book Electric Eden, by Rob Young, We smashed open a telephone and elastic-banded it to the fiddle.Mr. Swarbrick switched to electric fiddle and joined Fairport Convention for its next album, Liege & Lief, also released in 1969. Merging rock instruments and riffs with traditional songs of love, war and murder, the album became a cornerstone of trad-rock.Fairport Conventions lineup was perpetually unstable, and in the early 1970s Mr. Swarbrick took over more of the songwriting and lead singing. One of his major projects was Fairports 1971 concept album, Babbacombe Lee, about a Victorian convicted of murder who was freed after the gallows failed three times.Mr. Swarbrick was also a studio sideman on many British folk-rock recordings, and he continued to play more traditional music in the band Three Desperate Mortgages.The electric fiddle took a toll on Mr. Swarbricks hearing. By the end of the 1970s he was nearly deaf in one ear. He officially left Fairport Convention in 1984, although in 2007 he was part of a Fairport Convention lineup that reunited to perform Liege & Lief in concert.A smoker since his teens, Mr. Swarbrick struggled with failing health in the 1990s. He underwent three tracheotomies, and his emphysema grew so severe that at one point he needed oxygen onstage to perform.The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph mistakenly published an obituary for Mr. Swarbrick in 1999. Its not the first time Ive died in Coventry, he remarked afterward.A double lung transplant in 2004 improved his condition. He continued to make music, including a duo album with Mr. Carthy, Straws in the Wind, in 2006, and a final solo album, Raison Dtre (2010), which gathered many of his collaborators through the decades.Mr. Swarbrick is survived by his wife, Jill Swarbrick-Banks; three children, Emily, Isobel and Alexander; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He lived in Coventry.In a 2001 interview with the online music magazine Innerviews, Mr. Swarbrick said he had long had the same goals: To continue to be as expressive as I can and to not hold back, as well as not going over the top either. I would like to continue to expand my repertoire and do it all with integrity and the occasional whiskey."}
{"text": "During the second half of the 19th century, the French emperor Napoleon III assigned the prefect Baron Georges-Eugne Haussmann to modernize Paris. In addition to razing crooked medieval streets to build grand boulevards and public gardens, Haussmann oversaw the installation of approximately 20,000 gaslights throughout the city. His purported slogan: Light before all else.This phrase forms the premise of Electric Paris, an exhibition at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich that examines the City of Light through the lens of nighttime illumination. The 50 paintings, prints and photographs on view date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as gaslight supplanted oil lamps, and electric lighting superseded gas.These scenes  set mostly at night in homes, outdoors, in lively clubs and cafes  are responses by artists, including Mary Cassatt, Edgar Degas, douard Manet and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, to the evolving technologies that allowed and inspired them to see in the dark.There has been such an emphasis on the sun-dappled landscapes of the Impressionists and the atmospheric effects of natural light on the French countryside, said Margarita Karasoulas, the shows curator. This show is about artificial light.A mixture of illumination  celestial, reflected and manufactured  is evident in John Singer Sargents painting In the Luxembourg Gardens, in which an elegant couple strolls arm in arm through the park at dusk. Ms. Karasoulas noted six different renderings of light in the painting: a twilit sky; a haloed full moon; its light reflected in the boat basin; the milky luminescence of gravel; fiery gaslights shimmering through the foliage; and a glint of ash at the end of a mans cigarette.Sargents painting appears in Nocturnes, one of four thematic parts of the exhibition. In that section, Ms. Karasoulas said, she wanted to trace an artistic shift from nocturnes that feature celestial light to nocturnes that are increasingly urban in character.Alfred Stevenss Moonlight (Au clair de la lune), which opens Nocturnes, shows a contemplative woman standing at a large window that frames a starry sky and a turbulent sea, her face and forearm accented by the light of the moon.The moonlight in Paris at Night, a painting by Charles Courtney Curran, by contrast, is dwarfed by the artificial lighting illuminating the rainy streetscape. Here, yellowish gaslights glare along the sidewalks, their reflections wavering on wet pavement. Oil lamps burn inside horse-drawn carriages, and a lantern casts an orange blaze on a cart of fruit and a vendors face.In the section Lamplit Interiors are selections of intimate rooms whose darkness is interrupted by lamplight. People are absorbed in solitary activities  reading, sewing  in prints by Cassatt, Manet and Norbert Goeneutte. In Pierre Bonnards painting Interior: The Terrasse Children, a pair of oil lamps takes center stage on a wooden table where two boys sit reading. One lamp is lighted, the other is not; its surrounding space remains dark. The lamps are as intensely present as the figures, Ms. Karasoulas said.This area of the exhibition contains a more public interior, Le Bon March, the first department store in Paris. In Alexandre Lunoiss lithograph Le Magasin de Nouveauts (LExposition du Bon March), bustling shoppers are illuminated by the stores electric arc lamps, evidence of the new technologys role in fostering consumerism.Another shopping scenario, this one in Thophile Alexandre Steinlens lithograph The Shop Window, involves two women admiring the goods for sale in a brightly lighted window on an otherwise murky street.The print is in the Street Light part of the exhibition, which focuses on the technology of artificial light itself. Two abstract paintings by Sonia Delaunay-Terk, for example, use vibrant patterns of concentric circles to express her enchantment with the new incandescent electric lights on the Boulevard Saint-Michel.That section contains six photographs by Charles Marville, a photographer charged with documenting Haussmanns reconstruction of Paris. The prints show the varied motifs of the citys new lighting fixtures, including a five-branched model at the Louvre and a post at the Palais Garnier opera house that incorporates a classically sculpted nude balancing the lamp on her head.Marvilles shots are devoid of people, bringing the fixtures to the fore. They communicate a sense of silence and stillness, Ms. Karasoulas said.For museum visitors who wish to learn more about the science of electricity, the Bruce is hosting a complementary exhibition, Electricity, developed by the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and filled with hands-on activities for all ages.Artificial lighting was embraced by Pariss cafes and nightclubs, and artists passion for both the citys night life and its illumination can be seen in the final section of the exhibition, In and Out of the Spotlight.The flickering gas lamps and golden tones in Willard Metcalfs painting Au Caf evoke the spirited intimacy of the crowded cafe. Nearby, the stark contrasts in Jean-mile Laboureurs black-and-white woodcut The Bal Bullier suggest the harshness of the ballrooms electric lights.The allure of artificial illumination is apparent in Mademoiselle Bcat at the Caf des Ambassadeurs, a small black-and-white lithograph by Degas. In the lower left corner, the popular singer Emilie Bcat, clad in a frilly dress, performs with arms outstretched. The rest of the picture is a mlange of artificial lighting: soaring fireworks, an ornate gas chandelier, a horizontal band of gas jets, a cluster of globe-like fixtures and a gas streetlight that towers over Ms. Bcat.She is visually upstaged by the lighting, Ms. Karasoulas said. This work is not about the performance. Its about the light.Electric Paris is an expanded version of a 2013 exhibition curated by S. Hollis Clayson at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, in Williamstown, Mass. Ms. Clayson served as exhibition adviser for the Bruce adaptation.The exhibition also explores the publics fascination with artificial illumination, not only artists portrayal of it. Electricity amazed visitors to the 1889 world fair in Paris, where searchlights beamed from the top of the newly constructed Eiffel Tower and colorful fountains were illuminated with electric arc lighting.Curran captured the thrill of the fairs lighted fountains in Evening Illuminations at the Paris Exposition, in which a well-dressed woman perches on someones shoulders amid throngs in the shadowy fairgrounds vying to see the magical spectacle.The painting wonderfully captures how people reacted to the new lighting, Ms. Karasoulas said. Some are even holding umbrellas as if to shield themselves.You can see that they are in awe, she added."}

That was the joke when Ridley Scotts space-cowboy adventure, starring Matt Damon as an American astronaut abandoned on Mars, was thrown into the comedy category at the Golden Globes. But at the Oscars, it was simply a seven-time nominee, including for best picture, from a director who imagined whats beyond the dark side of the moon in Alien and Prometheus. Hands down, The Martian is the funniest, loosest and most optimistic of the group, at once an ode to far-out adventuring and to terra-firma home, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Theres a touch of Cecil B. DeMille in the filmmakers artistic DNA, and even more Stanley Kubrick, she suggested. But Mr. Scott is very much his own artist, one whose reputation as a visual stylist has at times obscured that his great, persistent theme is what it means to be human.THE FRENCH CONNECTION (1971) 8 p.m. on TCM.

Woman in Gold might be the epitome of middlebrow moviemaking, Wesley Morris wrote in The Times.

{"text": "Hugh Honour, a self-taught art historian who produced indispensable works on Neo-Classicism and romanticism and who, with John Fleming, wrote the monumental survey The Visual Arts: A History, one of the first to pay serious attention to non-Western art, died on May 19 at his home in Tofori, Italy. He was 88.His death was reported in the Italian press and in British newspapers.Mr. Honour moved to Italy in the mid-1950s to be with Mr. Fleming, and the two men, who were partners until Mr. Flemings death in 2001, entered into a highly productive writing and editing relationship. Allen Lane, the founder of Penguin Books, lived near them in a rented villa and proposed that they oversee a series, Style and Civilization, which would explore significant periods in art history, each with its own brief volume.The two editors accepted and performed brilliantly. Michael Leveys Early Renaissance was the first nonliterary work to win the Hawthornden Prize when it was published in 1967, and several other books in the series, notably Linda Nochlins Realism (1971) and Mr. Honours own contribution, Neo-Classicism (1968), quickly became standard works. All were published under the Pelican imprint.With Mr. Fleming, Mr. Honour went on to edit two more series for Penguin in the same format: Architect and Society and Art in Context. The Visual Arts: A History was published in Britain in 1982 as A World History of Art.Intended to compete with E. H. Gombrichs imposing survey, The Story of Art, the new work expanded the field to include the arts of Asia, Africa, Oceania and the indigenous cultures of the New World.Spanning continents and millennia, ranging from mans earliest cave paintings to the works of Picasso and beyond, this is a hugely ambitious book, the art critic Andrew Graham Dixon wrote in the British newspaper The Independent. But thanks to the breadth of their scholarship, the depth of their enthusiasm and the enviable freshness of their writing, Honour and Fleming triumphantly accomplish the herculean task they have set themselves.Writing in The Spectator after Mr. Honours death, the arts journalist Laura Freeman described the book as the scaffolding around which I have built everything I have learnt since of art history. She added, They give you not just the sweep of world art history but mini-essays, timelines and diversions: Roman luxury, Lady Murasaki on calligraphy, the cult of the carts at Chartres, a shamans mask.The book, awarded the Mitchell Prize for the History of Art in 1982, is now in its seventh edition.In a post on his Facebook page, Luca Menesini, the mayor of the municipality of Capannori, where the village of Tofori is situated, northwest of Florence, wrote that the tranquillity and beauty of our hills made it possible for Mr. Honour to pursue his studies, which will remain forever his important contribution to culture.Patrick Hugh Honour was born on Sept. 26, 1927, in Eastbourne, East Sussex. He attended Kings School in Canterbury and studied 18th-century English literature at St. Catharines College, Cambridge, graduating with a bachelors degree.As a volunteer at the print room of the British Museum, Mr. Honour helped catalog the collection of English drawings. He then worked briefly as an assistant to the director of the Leeds Art Gallery and Temple Newsam House, an affiliated Tudor-Jacobean House landscaped by Capability Brown.In 1954 he joined Mr. Fleming, a solicitor and amateur art historian whom he had met at Cambridge, in Lerici, on the Ligurian coast. Mr. Fleming had been hired to read to the literary scholar Percy Lubbock, a close friend of Henry Jamess, who had lost his sight. Through Mr. Lubbock the two men entered into the artistic and literary milieu of I Tatti, the art historian Bernard Berensons villa.Mr. Honour began contributing reviews and articles to The Times of London and The Connoisseur magazine and wrote Horace Walpole, a study of the 18th-century politician and man of letters, published in 1957.After the couple moved to Asolo, near Venice, Mr. Honour, in Chinoiserie: A Vision of Cathay (1961), turned his attention to the Western fascination with Chinese art in the 18th century that found expression in the visual and decorative arts.The book took an unusual tack, setting chinoiserie in a political and economic context and treating the style as a specific form of Western fantasy. His approach led to an invitation to organize the traveling exhibition The European Vision of America for the United States Bicentennial in 1976. As a companion to the exhibition, he wrote The New Golden Land: European Images of America From the Discoveries to the Present Time.After writing a travel book, The Companion Guide to Venice (1965), Mr. Honour embarked with Mr. Fleming on the Penguin Style and Civilization project. In addition to editing that multivolume series, they wrote The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture (1966), with Nikolaus Pevsner, and The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts (1977).Mr. Honour had ended Neo-Clacissism with a cliffhanger. Describing the 1808 Ingres painting Oedipus and the Sphinx, he wrote: A new vision of antiquity is here beginning to emerge  very different from the cool, calm land of liberty and reason described by Winckelmann and painted by David. In this grim mountain cleft there is no sign of an eternal springtime. The dark irrational gods are once more closing in.He continued the story with Romanticism, published in 1979. In The New York Review of Books, Charles Rosen and Henri Zerner called it the best book yet available (and perhaps ever written) on romanticism in the visual arts.In the 1980s, the De Menil Foundation in Houston engaged Mr. Honour to take part in its gargantuan project, begun in the 1960s, to document the representation of blacks in Western visual art. Mr. Honour contributed the fourth volume in the series, a two-part work titled The Image of the Black in Western Art: From the American Revolution to World War I (1989).With Mr. Fleming, Mr. Honour, who leaves no immediate survivors, returned to Venice and the world of Henry James in The Venetian Hours of Henry James, Whistler and Sargent.Published in 1991, it bore Mr. Honours stylistic stamp: authoritative, concise, evocative.Nowhere, not even in Holland, where the correspondence between the real aspects and the little polished canvases is so constant and so exquisite, do art and life seem so interfused and, as it were, so consanguineous, he and Mr. Fleming wrote. All the splendor of light and color, all the Venetian air and the Venetian history are on the walls and ceilings of the palaces; and all the genius of the masters, all the images and visions they have left upon canvas, seem to tremble in the sunbeams and dance upon the waves."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Speaker Paul D. Ryan delivered his partys weekly address on Friday  a rarity  giving a peek at the House Republican agenda that he and his colleagues will begin to roll out next week.That agenda was originally supposed to counter Donald J. Trump, whose views often stand apart from the partys policy traditions. But now that Mr. Ryan has officially endorsed his partys presumptive nominee, he says that his policy ideas will magically become Mr. Trumps, and that the nominee will help advertise them this fall and eventually promulgate them from the White House.The six policy task forces in the House will release their prescriptions one at a time over a course of Fridays this summer, under the broad title A Better Way. But perhaps it should be called A Bedeviled Way.Despite Mr. Ryans efforts to take some control, however, here are four reasons Mr. Trump, not the House speaker, is far more likely to set the Republican agenda this summer at his partys convention and into the fall campaign.Mr. Trump, long before he secured his partys nomination, has shown a remarkable ability for getting television coverage of his pronouncements. His remarks about building a wall between the United States and Mexico (not embraced by Mr. Ryan), barring most Muslims from entering the country (ditto), and ending free trade deals (again) have gotten constant coverage. Mr. Ryans promises to end poverty and to address executive authority? Not so much. While Mr. Ryan has weekly news conferences intended to talk about the House agenda, reporters tend to ask him almost exclusively about Mr. Trump.Some Republican candidates who ran for president this year, like Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, may have differed with Mr. Ryan on the margins on policy, but they hewed to the same core beliefs. Mr. Trump didnt simply beat those candidates, he destroyed them, often in a highly personal way. The traditional Republican agenda is not selling this year.The speaker is widely viewed as endorsing Mr. Trump to provide the party with the unity necessary to get House members re-elected and to help Mr. Ryan keep his day job. But if there is any unity in the party, it stems from Mr. Trumps agenda; Mr. Ryan has struggled to get even basic legislation passed. Trump had enough votes to win the nomination in pretty convincing fashion, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former aide to the House Republican leadership. The speaker has had a tough time getting enough votes to pass a budget in the House, let alone pass the rest of his agenda, he added.As Mr. Ryan was giving his modest endorsement to Mr. Trump, the Manhattan businessman was garnering his latest front-page headlines by suggesting that a federal judge overseeing the class-action suit against Trump University was biased because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Ryan, who has been a passionate voice against Mr. Trumps inflammatory rhetoric, may have a hard time pressing the inclusive agenda he has been promoting while at the same time promising allegiance to Mr. Trump. His voice of skepticism, not his agenda, is what got Mr. Ryan the most attention, and putting it on the shelf may not serve him well."}
{"text": "One of Chinas biggest threats to an American technology leader just found life a lot tougher.Huawei Technologies, which over the last decade has become a leading global supplier of internet and communications gear, has been subpoenaed by the United States Commerce Department to turn over information about its sales to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, Paul Mozur writes.These countries are, in American eyes, outlaw states or places where the United States restricts exports of American gear, and the subpoena was issued at Huaweis headquarters in Texas. It deals with exports of United States gear, which could mean things that Huawei made even in part in the United States.It couldnt come at a worse time for Huawei. The Chinese company has 170,000 employees and annual sales of $60 billion, an increase of 50 percent in the last three years. Almost none of that comes from the American market, where Cisco Systems dominates sales of the computer switches and internet routers both companies sell.A congressional panel in 2012 named Huawei, along with another Chinese company called ZTE, a security threat, largely curbing its sales in the United States.Huawei has worked hard to be a good citizen since then, boasting about its business practices and respect for intellectual property. Last week, it took the extraordinary step of suing Samsung of China for stealing Huaweis inventions in wireless technology.That amounted to a coming-out party for the company as a normal international technology player. Now the attention will turn to the Chinese habit of selling things to the enemies of the United States.More broadly, it is another example of the ways that governments appear increasingly willing to rein in tech companies, something Farhad Manjoo wrote about earlier this week.The borderless world, it turns out, still has some very powerful guard posts."}
{"text": "Last Memorial Day weekend, a team of New York Times photographers and reporters fanned out through Chicago to document how that citys violence had affected people and neighborhoods. New York Times staff photographer Todd Heisler describes how he and his colleagues sought to portray the story in new ways.Joshua Lott had just finished covering a news conference at Chicago Police Headquarters, where police officials announced the arrest of more than 100 gang members. Officials hoped this sweep would make a dent in the wave of gun violence that has plagued the city. As Mr. Lott was filing his photos at a nearby Starbucks, a woman ordered her coffee and walked out the door. Within seconds, she was mortally wounded by a stray bullet.This was the third person he had seen shot this year.Chicago is going through yet another grim season of gun violence. While this sprawling city of 2.7 million people who live in dozens of neighborhoods is diverse, it is also segregated. That reality is alarmingly reflected by the victims of gun violence, with most bloodletting concentrated on the West and South Sides. The North Side, which I called home for many years, is mostly unaffected by the violence, save for a few pockets. Most neighborhoods see no shootings at all.Mr. Lott, a Chicago native, has been covering crime in the city for The New York Times over the past year, working with the papers local reporting staff. As things have unfortunately kept getting worse, coverage has expanded.The paper set out to cover intensively the many shootings over the Memorial Day weekend, a notoriously violent time in the city. The logistics were complicated: A month earlier, the Chicago bureau staff spent a weekend gathering preliminary data. As we headed into the holiday weekend, we had a dispatcher who listened to scanners 24 hours a day and communicated with the team of reporters and photographers via Slack. We also each listened to the scanners constantly.Mr. Lott, Alex Wroblewski, Sam Hodgson, Whitney Curtis and I worked round-the-clock on 12-hour shifts. Mr. Lott and Mr. Wroblewski, who both live in Chicago and have documented this story extensively, worked more or less from dusk to dawn. We put one photographer on the West Side and one on the South Side. About a dozen reporters worked overlapping nine-hour shifts.The challenge was that we were not necessarily covering new ground. The local news media have relentlessly chronicled this story, staffing overnight teams indefinitely to document this tragic cycle of violence. Photographers like Carlos Javier Ortiz and Jon Lowenstein have devoted years to exploring the complicated social aspects in communities affected by gun violence. Our goal was to cover the news, but with an added obligation to search for subtleties, to stop at scenes we might normally just drive past because they lacked visual drama. Or to visit places where shots rang out but no one  fortunately  was hit. To explore the rhythm of events that occur repeatedly, yet are all different in their own nuanced ways.And it was equally important to follow up with victims and families, and to document daily life in the city.There is a ranch home on the Far South Side where, if you kneel down and lean into the bedroom wall, you can peer through a bullet hole and see Julia Rhodens grandchildren playing in the front yard. Early on Saturday of the Memorial Day weekend, she was sitting on her bed watching television. Her husband, Calvin, was sitting outside when someone walked up and opened fire, missing him entirely but peppering the concrete, screen door and awning with bullets. One of those bullets ripped through the bedroom wall and lodged in Ms. Rhodens back. When I met her on Sunday, she had just been released from the hospital and was cooking dinner for her family. Blood still seeped through her bandage and shirt.Loud noises make her uneasy now.As I drove away and turned the corner, I was startled to see children galloping by on horseback. Just two blocks from the Rhoden home, Rashad Branscomb, who owns the horses and keeps them in a nearby suburb, was having a family picnic. He was unaware of the Rhoden shooting, but immediately rattled off two other nearby addresses where there has been gang activity.We are trying to get them out of here. said Mr. Branscomb, who grew up in Englewood, where a lot of the shooting is taking place.For me, it was a small sign of hope for a city I still consider home.Chicago is an extremely beautiful city, Mr. Lott said. So I hope we can figure out a solution to curb crime. Everyone deserves a right to live, especially the kids.Follow @heislerphoto and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "When David Godlis was shooting off-kilter, kinetic photos of bands like Television, Talking Heads and Blondie, he had a sense that the scene unfolding in the Bowery club CBGB was important. But no less vital than the sound being made was the punk aesthetic  urgent and gritty  that Mr. Godlis was helping define.The images from those raucous nights in the late 1970s have proved to be just as enduring as the records that came out of the scene. Possibly to the horror of anyone there at the birth of punk, many of these pictures have become part of rock n rolls iconography.But beyond those familiar pictures are less codified moments that capture the era.The band Television pose on a street corner, their disinterest at being photographed hinting that they would be more influential than popular. John Lydon (also known as Johnny Rotten) somehow seems to be vibrating with disdain while simply sitting on a sofa. Even Keith Richards, slumming it with Jim Carroll (poet, musician and author of The Basketball Diaries), manages to look like just a guy with a guitar onstage.These and other images are collected in Mr. Godliss new book, History Is Made at Night. On June 25, he will be signing the book at the Queens Museum, where five of his photographs are included in an exhibition about the Ramones and the birth of punk.Punk now is a style statement, and many of its pioneers  Joey Ramone, Hilly Kristal, Mr. Carroll  have died. Mr. Godlis, 64, is proud of his part in the past, but he has no intention of living there.CBGB was replaced by a John Varvatos store, and the club itself survives only in name, as a branded restaurant at the Newark airport. But Mr. Godlis still sees people from the punk days, like Patti Smith or the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch (who wrote the books introduction), although he shoots them with a digital camera now.Follow @GODLIS_photos and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "ROME  A year after approving the creation of a new tribunal to discipline bishops who covered up child sex abuse by priests, Pope Francis scrapped that plan on Saturday and issued new guidelines to oust those who have been negligent in handling such cases.Under the new guidelines, issued in an apostolic letter, Roman Catholic bishops who have failed to properly handle sex abuse cases will be investigated by four Vatican offices. If the bishops are found to have betrayed their mission, they will be removed to protect those who are the weakest among the persons entrusted to them.Canon law already provides for the removal of bishops for serious causes, the pope acknowledged, but he said his letter was meant to clarify that the serious causes include the negligence of bishops in the exercise of their office, in particular in the case of sexual abuse of minors and vulnerable adults.The decree sought to appease the growing frustrations of victims of abuse and their advocates who say that despite Francis promises of zero tolerance toward abuse and past pledges to hold bishops accountable, not enough has been done.For some, the decree  issued on the popes own initiative  was a strong signal that Francis was paying attention.This is a major step to ensure that no bishop can fail in his duty to protect children and vulnerable adults, and if he does fail he can be removed, said Gerard OConnell, a Vatican expert who writes for America: The National Catholic Review. I think it goes a long way to respond to what was still seen as a big loophole in the system. It closes that loophole.The decree states that a diocesan bishop, or eparch or the superior of a religious congregation can be legitimately removed from his office in cases where he has, through negligence, committed or omitted acts that have caused grave harm to others, either with regard to physical persons, or with regard to the community itself.In the case of minors or vulnerable adults, it is sufficient that the lack of diligence be grave, Francis wrote in the decree.The Rev. Federico Lombardi, the director of the Holy See Press Office, wrote in an explanatory note on Saturday that the measure effectively lowers the standard necessary for a bishop to be removed from office when there is negligence with regard to cases of sexual abuse.With the new guidelines, Francis put into action what he promised last year when he approved a Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up or failing to prevent the abuse of minors. That tribunal never materialized, amid a series of juridical and bureaucratic problems.The tribunal was complex from a legal point of view, so after further studies and in-depth analysis, this solution emerged, which is linear, clear and follows already established practices, Father Lombardi said in an interview.The accused bishops will have the right to defend themselves, and the final word will be that of the pope, the decree states. He will be advised by a panel of legal experts, most likely made up of cardinals and bishops, Father Lombardi said in the note.The decree will go into effect on Sept. 5.Some victims of child sex abuse and their advocates remained skeptical.Over the decades, weve seen so many policies and procedures and protocol that sound good on paper but are rarely followed, said David Clohessy of St. Louis, the director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.In the case of the abuse of minors, no new process should be required, Mr. Clohessy said.The pope and his predecessors should have removed dozens of bishops long ago with the powers they already have, he added. Its not a lack of policy but courage and will that prevents popes from acting."}
{"text": "Fire at the Ridge, at Powder Ridge ski area in Middlefield, isnt what one would expect. A restaurant in a base lodge at a family ski hill serving foie gras, salad with duck confit and a $32 steak? An unwritten rule of restaurant economy holds that base lodge may never appear in the same sentence as pistachio sage gremolata or lemongrass nage. Fire at the Ridge blithely defies it.Featuring a soaring atrium dining room fitted out with potted palms and an artificial tree, the restaurant has a glossy generic look, like a Marriott hotel lobby. On one warm evening, the window views disclosed green ski slopes, idle chairlifts and two women on horseback riding by. It was lovely, but lonely. And the cavernous space amplified the loneliness, with dining setups adrift on the vast open floor.Chef Kevin Cottle trained at the Culinary Institute of America, and brings serious culinary experience. I had a vision of high-end ingredients presented simply but artistically, he told me over the phone after my visits, with flavors that would explain themselves.Sometimes they do. The clam chowder achieved an optimal balance of smoky, bacony richness and brothy saltiness, with the added plus of two Cheddar biscuits. A duet of steak tartare and scallop ceviche was terrific, especially the ceviche, compacted with peach bits, cilantro, a jolt of Thai pepper, lots of lime, and just the right amount of red onion  not at all boggy or heavy, but light and lively, like a salsa. Another appetizer, ricotta gnocchi, came in a big bowl mingled with roasted tomatoes, sliced asparagus, garlic scapes, bits of lobster meat and sauted bell peppers, its flavors interesting and strong.Some entrees excelled. A misnamed clam bake consisted of an entire lobster, poached and shelled, the tail propped showily atop a custardy polenta studded with corn kernels, tricked out with two spears of asparagus and a single clam, in a luxuriously buttery broth. A trio of plump Georges Bay scallops was both tasty and pretty, pan-seared to a caramelized golden brownness and arrayed on a rectangular white plate atop an attractive spring risotto, with lemon crme frache lending a velvety richness and pea pure a brilliant green coloration. A New York strip, served with a cheesy bacon risotto and a Mexican mole, provided a hearty pleasure.Other entrees fell short. Some failed to exceed the sum of their parts, like a tuna fillet plopped in a bowl with two dumplings and two baby bok choi in an uninspired ginger-soy broth. Prominent flavors sometimes vanished: I picked up no hint of the Sichuan pepper rub on the tuna, and, try as I might, I tasted neither orange nor thyme in a bland orange-thyme infused lamb loin.Mr. Cottle is a veteran of two TV reality cooking shows, Hells Kitchen and Kitchen Casino, and his kitchen is nothing if not ambitious. You see it, for instance, in the intricate structure of a chilled lemon souffl, pouched within an undulating ribbon of white chocolate set on edge, and decorated with a glassine sugar wafer whose rosy hue echoes the accompanying currant jam. But some impressive-looking preparations dont deliver a matching taste. Its obvious that care has been taken with a toy box salad  four spears of grilled white asparagus enclosing quartered tomatoes, radish shavings and three dollops of mozzarella burrata. But the asparagus was fibrous; the tomatoes, described as heirloom, looked and tasted like supermarket grape tomatoes; and the burrata was chewy rather than creamy.The menu at Fire at the Ridge fairly bristles with foie gras, caviar, truffles and other classic fine-dining items. This approach may need rethinking. With the scallop entree, for instance, I would ditch the caviar beurre blanc and add a fourth scallop. I would forget about the pomegranate arils on the vanilla-infused pineapple carpaccio. In fact, I would forget about the carpaccio altogether.Part of the problem is cost. On one visit we shared an appetizer and salad, two entrees and the cheapest bottle of wine on the list  no dessert  and the bill with tip came to $150. But there is also the nature of the setting. One winter evening we sat at a window booth, while a bunch of children were having a loud, fun aprs-ski time on the snowy deck outside. A successful restaurant perfectly aligns place, cuisine, price, ambience and audience. Sometimes that means relaxing a bit and finding the sweet spot of your clientele.Mr. Cottle described the restaurant as part of a larger, ambitious plan to turn Powder Ridge into a major year-round destination. For that more expansive future, Fire at the Ridge might turn out to be perfect. For right now, as Mr. Cottle himself admits, the cart may be a little bit ahead of the horse."}
{"text": "LONDON  At least four migrants died and around 340 were rescued on Friday, after a boat bound for Italy capsized in the Mediterranean off the island of Crete, officials and humanitarian agencies said, in the latest tragedy at sea as refugees try desperately to reach Europe.The Greek Shipping Ministry said that two Coast Guard vessels and three helicopters had been sent to scour the area for more survivors.More than 1,000 migrants may have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe over a recent eight-day period, the International Organization for Migration reported on Tuesday, and the deaths on Friday, which occurred about 75 nautical miles south of Crete, add to the toll of refugees suffering.The migration organization said that the capsized boat was believed to have been carrying 700 people and was thought to have left from Egypt. Greek officials said the boat had overturned in international waters that were under Egypts authority.The Italian Coast Guard said in a statement that it had alerted the Egyptian authorities to the capsizing on Thursday, but that the Egyptians had declined to take charge of a rescue operation because the site was not in its jurisdiction.The Italians then turned to Greece, and sent a message to all vessels in the area.Five Greek ships were near where the boat capsized, and they were joined by the Coast Guard vessels and helicopters, Greek officials said.A merchant ship reported at 7:20 a.m. on Friday that the migrant vessel had capsized, the Italian Coast Guard said.The Egyptian military, which includes the Coast Guard, declined to comment and referred all inquiries to the Foreign Ministry, saying the military is not a decision maker.In turn, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, referred questions to the military, saying he had no knowledge of the event or of the Italian request for help.The mixed response from Egypt highlighted the struggle that Europe is facing in the worsening migrant crisis, with refugees often risking their lives trying to reach the Continent.The events on Friday come after one of the deadliest periods in recent memory in the Mediterranean, during which three ships sank over three days. At least 700 people from three boats are believed to have drowned, according to the United Nations refugee agency.Those deaths could push the toll for the year to more than 2,000, and with summer approaching, concerns are growing that human trafficking along the North African coastline will intensify.Those fears were underscored on Friday, when the spokesman for the Libyan Red Crescent told The Associated Press that the number of people who perished when a boat capsized off the Libyan shore on Wednesday had risen to 107, including 40 women and five children.Until recently, most migrants heading to Europe had traveled from Turkey to Greece, seeking entry into the European Union. From there, they often traveled through the Balkans to destinations in Western and Northern Europe, most frequently to Germany.Balkan countries such as Macedonia that are poorly equipped to deal with the influx have shut their borders, however, and Turkey has reached a deal with the European Union to help cut the flow of migrants across the Aegean Sea. The result is that migrants have been seeking alternative, often more perilous, routes.As Europe struggles to prevent migrants from reaching the Continent, tensions appeared to be growing at Greek encampments used to house the migrants who do arrive.There were brawls at two camps on Thursday, one on the island of Samos and the other in Oraiokastro, in the countrys north. In Samos, migrants wielded knives and iron bars, and they lit fires.There were also reports of unrest at the Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos on Wednesday night, with Afghans fighting Pakistanis. The migrants set fire to tents and blankets, and at least 15 people were wounded in the clashes.With many of the refugees awaiting the outcome of applications for asylum, and others fearing deportation, aid workers said they expected more outbreaks of violence."}
{"text": "Beijing can be a pretty informal place. People walk outside in their pajamas, and when its hot some men lift up their shirts to expose their bellies. Even President Xi Jinping dresses down, usually in his trademark dark windbreaker.The authorities have determined that one place in Chinas capital has gotten far too casual: the marriage registration office.Some people wear sleeveless shirts and shorts, or slippers, to register their marriages, Han Mingxi, head of the wedding registry office for the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, told Beijing Daily, the official newspaper of the citys Communist Party committee. You see them and can immediately tell their attitude toward the marriage registry is too casual. This can easily create all sorts of problems.China has seen an increasing divorce rate in recent years, a phenomenon that has been especially pronounced in Beijing. While the number of couples marrying each year from 2011 to 2014 remained constant around 170,000, the number divorcing over those years climbed to 56,000 from 33,000, according to the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau.As part of new rules going into effect on July 1, wedding registry officials will elevate the sense of ceremonial formality, Mr. Han told Beijing Daily. But unlike bouncers at an exclusive nightclub, registry officials wont be able to turn away slovenly dressed couples. The new rules will not allow people to be blocked from having their marriages registered, Mr. Han said, but rather will call for officials to make suggestions about appropriate attire.A column on Nanfangwang, an online news outlet affiliated with the government of Guangdong Province, expressed support for the new rules. Although it acknowledged that some people might consider suggestions on wedding registration attire an example of regulatory overreach, it predicted that the proposal would have a positive effect on marriages.Of course, strengthening and advancing newlyweds understanding of marriage isnt something that must be done, the column said. But if all newlyweds would treat the marriage registry with importance and pay attention to ceremony, then it would definitely help these newlyweds have a sense of the value and importance of marriage."}
{"text": "After running a congressional oversight committee like a Republican opposition research shop for more than two years, Representative Trey Gowdy appears to be gearing up for the finale. Democrats on the Select Committee on Benghazi expect that a final report will drop soon, just as Hillary Clinton appears poised to clinch the Democratic nomination.If things had gone his way, Mr. Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, would have found a way to torpedo Mrs. Clintons presidential ambitions. After all, Republican lawmakers have admitted that this is precisely what they set out to do.But things have not gone well for Mr. Gowdy, who has run the investigation with the dexterity and grace of a blindfolded toddler swinging at a piata. Having pored over reams of documents, grilled Mrs. Clinton in an 11-hour session in October and hauled in more than 100 people for interviews, the Republicans seem to have come up with nothing.In recent months, Republicans on the committee have pestered the Pentagon to track down potential witnesses who might have damning things to say about Washingtons response to the attack on American government facilities in Benghazi, in eastern Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. They include a man who identified himself as a military mechanic in an intriguing Facebook post, and John from Iowa, a person who claimed to be a drone operator who had called into a right-wing radio talk show.Stephen Hedger, the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, complained to Mr. Gowdy in a letter in April about the recent crescendo of requests. The Pentagon, Mr. Hedger wrote, couldnt find John from Iowa after expending significant resources to locate anyone who might match the description of this person.The Benghazi committee, which was set up in May 2014, has been operational for longer than the 9/11 Commission was. It has dragged on longer than congressional investigations into the attack on Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President Kennedy, Watergate, the Iran-contra scandal, the 1983 bombing that killed 241 American service members in Beirut and the response to Hurricane Katrina.The committee has spent nearly $7 million looking into an incident that had already been the subject of an independent investigation commissioned by the State Department and nine reports issued by seven other congressional committees. Those reviews faulted the federal government for failing to provide proper security for the American ambassador in Libya and three of his colleagues who were killed, but found no evidence of a cover-up or gross negligence by Mrs. Clinton.Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the exercise showed Congress at its worst. If you want a case study of why people are frustrated with government, this investigation is it, said Mr. Cummings, who, along with a handful of Democrats, has remained on the committee to monitor what they regard as a partisan crusade. They see all this effort, all this money, a budget that is endless, addressing issues that have already been addressed."}
{"text": "HONOLULU  Anna Sullivan is prohibited from sitting on a sidewalk. She cannot wander off to find food without worrying that the police might seize her shopping cart. She cannot sleep on Waikiki Beach without fear of being rousted.Ms. Sullivan, 45, has been homeless for eight years since she got out of prison. But these days  after run-ins with the police over where she sleeps, sits or leaves her belongings  she tries to keep away from Waikiki, the bustling tourist district whose sidewalks and beaches she once used as her home.Tickets, tickets, tickets, she said, already looking weary at the start of her morning, sipping a cup of iced coffee as she sat on a bench by the beach. The cops give you a ticket to keep you moving. And then you have to pay the ticket for sleeping in the park. It gets to you.Two years ago, Honolulu, for all its opulence and appeal to tourists, was a nationally known hub of homelessness: people sprawling on benches and sidewalks, panhandling, guarding piles of tents and clothes, sleeping in doorways and moving around aimlessly. Business leaders described the atmosphere as a fundamental threat to the tourist-based economy.But these days, the homeless who had crowded large parts of this city are, to a considerable extent, gone.The change came after Honolulu responded with force to what the governor described as a state of emergency, passing tough criminal laws aimed at ridding sidewalks, streets and parks of the homeless. At the same time, the city sent teams of social workers out to help the homeless move into shelters. And the tourist industry put up money to cover airfare for homeless people who had come from the mainland and who said they were ready to go home.Now it is possible to spend hours wandering Waikiki and Chinatown, two historic neighborhoods where hundreds of homeless people once settled, and encounter only the occasional reminder that Hawaii has the highest per capita homeless population in the nation.A battery of laws that effectively criminalize homelessness is sweeping the nation, embraced by places like Orlando, Fla.; Santa Cruz, Calif.; and Manchester, N.H. By the end of 2014, 100 cities had made it a crime to sit on a sidewalk, a 43 percent increase over 2011, according to a survey of 187 major American cities by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty. The number of cities that banned sleeping in cars jumped to 81 from 37 during that same period. There have been laws outlawing panhandling and authorizing the removal of tent camps.Honolulus mayor, Kirk Caldwell, coined the phrase compassionate disruption to describe what the city is doing, because the measures are accompanied by outreach programs.But there seems little doubt among city officials and the homeless themselves that the change on the streets is primarily a result of the laws that permit the authorities to tell people to stop sitting on sidewalks, and to seize belongings that are illegally piled on public land.The crackdown comes amid the gentrification that is transforming cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Honolulu, contributing to higher housing costs and increased homelessness. You know what they say the state bird of Hawaii is? asked Eric John Odegaard, 44, who has been homeless most of his life, gesturing to the growing Honolulu skyline. The crane. Mr. Odegaard sleeps in the nearby mountains.In Honolulu, the most recent homeless law made it illegal to sit or lie on sidewalks, with criminal penalties if warnings are ignored in Waikiki, the tourist district, and in Chinatown. That followed laws that let the authorities seize the belongings of homeless people left in public spaces, and that closed down many parks and beaches at night. So far, there have been only a handful of arrests; the strategy here is to use the threat of tickets and jail to prod homeless people to go someplace else.I would tell you emphatically that its working really, really well, said George Szigeti, the head of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The No. 1 reason that people were saying they would not come back to Hawaii was because of homelessness.Some social workers say that the specter of enforcement makes it easier to persuade the homeless to try a night in a shelter bed or enter a drug treatment program. Other advocates have sued the city over some of its approaches.For all the applause from the tourist industry and City Hall, the Honolulu experience appears to be more of a salve to the concerns of civic leaders than a solution to finding a bed for those without a place to live. In 2015, the Department of Housing and Urban Development counted 7,620 people as homeless in Hawaii, whose population totals 1.4 million. The vast majority of the homeless are in Honolulu, on Oahu.While homeless people have largely vanished from the areas that were the focus of the crackdown, many have just gone elsewhere, into the dense greenery up Diamond Head Road, to out-of-the-way alleys and remote corners of public parks.In interviews, homeless men and women displayed a mastery of the intricacies of state and city laws, of how some sidewalks are covered and others are not and of how beaches open at 5 a.m., allowing a few hours to sleep before it gets too hot. They know not to smoke a cigarette on a beach or push a shopping cart along the sidewalk in Waikiki, prohibited activities which will draw the attention of the police.We had to go from the state side of the street to the city property, said Brian Bowser, 36, who has been homeless since 1995. We just do our best.Hawaii has among the highest per capita living costs in the country; there are not many places where the indigent can afford to live. You see tents going up everywhere, said Victor Geminiani, the executive director of Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, an advocate of homeless people. Its just a matter of Whac-a-Mole.Ernie Martin, the chairman of the Honolulu City Council, said he voted reluctantly for the sidewalk law, known as the sit-lie measure, and saw it as a stopgap. At the end of the day it doesnt matter: We can sit-lie the whole island if we want, he said. The population has to go somewhere. We cant push them into the ocean.The sidewalk ordinance took effect at the end of 2014, and through March 1 of this year the police had issued 16,215 warnings and written 534 summonses, according to city officials.People moved because they were being harassed, said Dan Foster, 49, who has been homeless since coming from Oregon more than a year ago. Between dealing with cops and legal authorities, theyd rather just go so they dont have to deal with it. I think its a violation of our constitutional rights, our right to sit places and sleep where we choose. But you know what? I understand. Theres a lot going on out here.The City Council last year expanded the sit-lie ordinance to include 16 neighborhoods, putting more territory off bounds. Asked whether he would advise other cities to embrace the approach, Mr. Caldwell responded without hesitation. Yes, he said.Sit-lie is not about homelessness, Mr. Caldwell said, as he took a visitor on a tour around the city, pointing out the new high-priced condominiums rising over boulevards where tents and homeless outposts once lined the street. Sit-lie is about commerce. Its about keeping sidewalks open for people to do business.Across town the next morning, police officers monitoring a bank of surveillance cameras at the Chinatown substation spotted Darlin Abelaye, who has lived most of her 55 years on the streets here. She was settled in front of a liquor store, her legs splayed, struggling to light a cigarette. By sitting down, she was violating the 16-month-old city ordinance.Moments later, Ms. Abelaye looked up as two officers approached on Maunakea Street. She peered up the empty sidewalks and rose unsteadily. By now, she knew where to head when the police came. Ill go to Aala Park, she said. Thats where Ill sleep.Kakaako is a retail neighborhood two miles up the shoreline from Waikiki, and not a place where tourists tend to stray.Last summer it became a flash point in Honolulus campaign to rid the streets of the homeless. Sidewalks and patches of grass were covered with tents, sleeping bags, shopping carts, folding chairs and piles of belongings. Merchants and residents in Kakaako complained that the influx was a result of the campaign to push people out of Chinatown and Waikiki.And so, a week after Labor Day, teams of city sanitation workers showed up, carrying brooms and shovels. They were followed by garbage trucks. As the police and the homeless looked on, the workers cleared the sidewalks and streets, throwing tents, blankets, clothing and refuse that had been left behind into the trucks.The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in the United States District Court in Hawaii, charging that Honolulu was violating the constitutional rights of people struggling to survive. We are very concerned about laws that criminalize the status of indigency, said Daniel M. Gluck, the legal director of the A.C.L.U. of Hawaii. We have seen some very aggressive laws here.The court agreed. In January, Honolulu signed a stipulation promising to wait 45 days before destroying the belongings it seized, allowing people a chance to retrieve them, and to guarantee 24 hours notice, in most cases, before clearing sidewalks and parks. The city is required to videotape the material it takes. We have to store property longer, which we are doing, Mr. Caldwell said. We have to inventory what we store. The sweeps have gone on: Eight-person crews go out five days a week.These kinds of cases, challenging city actions, are cropping up elsewhere. The United States Justice Department filed a brief last summer asking a federal court to throw out a Boise, Idaho, ordinance that prohibited sleeping in public places, arguing that anti-camping regulations in a city where there was insufficient shelter violated constitutional provisions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court dismissed the lawsuit brought by homeless plaintiffs.It was a good opportunity for us to make very clear that jurisdictions like Boise cant make it a crime for people who are homeless to sleep in public places when there arent enough beds in the city, said Vanita Gupta, the principal deputy assistant general with the departments civil rights division. Punishing someone for sleeping in a public place would basically be punishing someone for being homeless. Criminalizing conduct that is integral to ones status is equivalent to criminalizing status.The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced this year that it would steer homeless assistance funds away from cities that use various prohibitions that it says make homelessness illegal. We are strongly against such measures, said Matthew Doherty, the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which coordinates the federal response to homelessness. By criminalizing peoples lives as they experience homelessness, it makes it harder to get them out of homelessness.Ralph McCarroll sat slumped in a wheelchair on a busy Waikiki street corner, the morning sun bright over his head, his face tracked with stitches and bruises from tripping on the curb the night before. A pint of vodka was tucked at his side. Justin Phillips, who spent years living on the street and is now the senior outreach officer for the Institute for Human Services, a nonprofit agency which helps the homeless, crouched beside him.Can I get you something? Mr. Phillips asked, taking out a packet of baby wipes to clean the wounds on the mans face.Another bottle of vodka, Mr. McCarroll said with a cackle.I cant do that for you, Mr. Phillips said, leaning in to whisper another idea.If I wanted detox, I would have been there already, Justin, Mr. McCarroll replied.Mr. McCarroll has maintained his perch on his corner, law or no law, for as long as he can remember. Few authorities would want to be in a position of rousting a battered, 64-year-old man from his wheelchair. Not that they have given up. I have 30 tickets, he said. Im never going to pay them and they know that.Yet that does not appear to deter Mr. Phillips, who is trying to persuade people whose plight he once shared to break out of this life. We come out here, we try to get them into the shelter, cleaned up, Mr. Phillips said. At that point, well try to do an intervention: Hey, you want to go to detox? By the way, we have an outpatient program for alcohol and drugs. Can I sign you up? While punitive laws have drawn criticism from federal officials, they are applauded here by some advocates of the homeless. A lot of people say these laws dont work, said Kimo Carvalho, the director of community relations with the Institute for Human Services. But as a service provider, we advocated for these laws because our homeless outreach teams need to motivate clients to take action.Two years ago, the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Association gave $500,000 to the Institute for Human Services on a promise from the institute that it could cut the homeless population in Waikiki in half. The money went to pay for teams like the one Mr. Phillips was leading, a shuttle to take people to a shelter for a shower, clean clothes and food, and the airline relocation program. This is our economic engine. We absolutely had to do this, said Mr. Szigeti, the head of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, who was the president of the lodging and tourism association at the time.There were 559 men and women living on the streets of Waikiki and Chinatown when the program began in November 2014. As of early March, that population had been slashed by 392, Mr. Carvalho said: 219 had been placed in temporary or permanent housing, and another 173 had been flown out.Still, enforcement is a fraught subject in Hawaii, whose allure is built in no small part on marketing itself to the world as the Aloha State, with a welcoming atmosphere. Mr. Caldwell recoils at the use of words like sweep and confiscation. Leland Cadoy, a police corporal walking the streets of Waikiki with a reporter, kindly addressed every homeless person he saw, and spoke only of R.C.P.s.Residentially challenged people, he said, when asked about the acronym. You call someone homeless, it sounds derogatory.Even as he applauded the changes in Waikiki, David Ige, the governor, said the crackdown was not the answer to the homeless crisis that has become such a part of life here. He said that what Honolulu needed was affordable housing, a goal that has stubbornly eluded this island.Homelessness has reached every community in the island  in areas where you didnt see them five years ago, he said. If you are just enforcing and moving people from location to location you are not really reducing or solving the problem. Its just making it someone elses problems. Its not like they can leave the state."}
{"text": "Army teams and emergency crews on Friday recovered the bodies of four soldiers who were missing after a truck overturned a day earlier during a training mission near Fort Hood in central Texas, an official said. The bodies of five other soldiers were found on Thursday. Three soldiers were rescued.Maj. Gen. John Uberti, the bases deputy commanding general, said on Friday morning that the accident was a tragic loss and that the Army was making the search a priority.The three who were rescued were in stable condition in a hospital and could be discharged later on Friday, he added.General Uberti provided no further details about the soldiers or the accident, which occurred in an area that had been inundated with heavy rain over the last week.At least an additional inch of rain was expected on Friday, and the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for northern and central Texas through midnight. The rainfall comes on top of record-breaking rains in parts of the state that have resulted in the deaths of at least six other people.The accident, which took place about 12 miles north of the bases main area, was reported shortly after 11 a.m. on Thursday. Rescue teams searched by air, land and water.Chris Haug, a spokesman for Fort Hood, said on Thursday that floodwaters from recent rains were believed to have overturned the truck, a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle, while the soldiers were conducting a low-water crossing, and that the episode would be investigated.Mr. Haug said the soldiers were on a mission that they do every day, and driving on a normal dirt road that was not known to be a problem.Around the time of the accident, concerns about flooding had caused emergency personnel to close a paved road parallel to the dirt road.All the low water crossings are potentially dangerous when weve had this much rain, another Fort Hood spokesman, Tyler Broadway, said.The names of the victims will not be made public until their families are notified.This is not the first fatal episode in recent months during a training exercise at Fort Hood. In November, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed during an exercise at the base, killing four crew members."}

{"text": "How does a responsibly repressed therapist become that woman  you know, the kind who guts her already dysfunctional family by sleeping with the ones they love? Last season on Hulus Casual, Valerie (Michaela Watkins) was left by her husband for a younger woman; packed up her precocious teenage daughter, Laura (Tara Lynne Barr), moved in with her brother, Alex (Tommy Dewey), a dating-site creator; and went a bit bonkers as she navigated singledom with him as her wingman. The show left us as Alex discovered Valerie after she had an Ecstasy-fueled encounter with his girlfriend; before that, she had sex with Lauras teacher crush.Season 2, debuting Tuesday, June 7, finds a perplexed Valerie wondering how it all went so wrong, while Laura and Alex try to blunt their anger and pain. Im kind of trying to distance myself from that word, hate, verbally and emotionally, Alex tells his sister. Hows that working for you? she asks. So far happiness is kind of boring, he says. Good thing Casual is not."}

{"text": "Performances at the outdoor music festival Governors Ball, including one by Kanye West, were canceled on Sunday because of severe weather.In an email to ticket holders, the festivals organizers said that the safety of fans, artists and crew always comes first, and that all performances for Sunday would be canceled because of a high likelihood of lightning around the stages at Randalls Island Park in New York.Mr. West was the headliner among nearly two dozen performances scheduled for the festivals third and final day. Fans expressed their disappointment on Twitter:Governors Ball typically has a rain or shine policy. The festival has persisted in the past despite rain  most recently, Saturday. The Panorama festival, with a lineup including Arcade Fire, Kendrick Lamar and LCD Soundsystem, is scheduled to take place at the same location in July.Ticket holders were told they would receive refunds, and were directed to the festivals website for updates."}
{"text": "The Gene: A DissentTo the Editor:It is not surprising that James Gleick, a journalist, reviewing The Gene: An Intimate History (May 15), should find Siddhartha Mukherjees view of genetics from great and clarifying height to be definitive. I, who work closer to the ground, see the book as incomplete. Mukherjee has opted for a largely metaphorical description of genes, their variants and their expression. Master regulatory genes scurry about, and one even shouts. Precision gives way to romance: The methyl tags decorated the strands of DNA like charms on a necklace. This delightful image fails to explain how the necklace imparts information, or how it would be duplicated each time cells divide, to perpetuate a pattern of gene expression. Mukherjees readers would have been capable of understanding that a methyl group is added to C, one of the four bases that encode DNA, but only at very specific sites, to silence gene expression in a way that is heritable.There is much to admire in the book; it does soar high above the fundamental ideas of genetics and molecular biology, the role of genes in behavior and the social misuse of these ideas in eugenics movements. But at that height, the miraculous  and eminently explainable  process by which proteins and growth factors modulate expression of our 20,000 genes into blood, bone, skin, cerebellum, is invisible.JAMES E. HABERWALTHAM, MASS.The writer is a professor of biology at Brandeis University.*AudiobooksTo the Editor:Nina Burleighs review in your Audiobooks section (May 22) of the young readers adaptation of Daniel James Browns remarkable book The Boys in the Boat was not only disappointing, but showed a tin ear. In praising Lauren Hillenbrands equally brilliant  though very different  book, Unbroken, she writes about Louis Zamperinis heroic battle to survive on the sea and in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. She then dismisses Browns reporting about what occurred in Hitlers Germany leading up to the 1936 Olympics and to the same war: Its not clear why the world needed another book about how the Americans triumphed over Nazi Germany in the 1936 Olympics.Really? So another book on Americans dealing with the Japanese is relevant but one on a virtually untouched subject involving the Berlin Olympics is not? (I say this as someone whose father fought in the Pacific theater.) Burleighs reference to the mystical bond, in quotation marks, among the oarsmen led me to think she didnt buy Browns thesis.As someone who has been around athletes my entire adult life, I can tell you that the bonds formed by teams  especially in a grueling sport like rowing where all eight oarsmen must be in perfect sync  are very real, and frequently last a lifetime. Theres an old saying among the athletes at Army and Navy: Only a midshipman can understand what its like to be a cadet and only a cadet can understand what its like to be a midshipman. Thats why we all get chills when the teams stand together every year at the end of the football game for the playing of both alma maters: the bonds that exist between opponents. That sort of  yes  mystical bonding is a huge part of the reason so many people were moved by Browns book. I am sorry Burleigh missed that point.JOHN FEINSTEINPOTOMAC, MD.The writer is the author of 36 books, including, most recently The Legends Club.*To the Editor:Of the last three audiobooks Ive listened to, only one was well narrated. The first, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, is read by the author, who has a thick Italian accent. That makes understanding content, which includes many esoteric terms and names, a constant strain. The second, The Magic of Awareness, is narrated by a guy who sounds as though his regular job is recording commercial voice-overs: He makes every sentence seem so important, which gets in the way of appreciating the content. But the third, Shoe Dog, is perfect. The Broadway actor Norbert Leo Butz allows the cadence, tone and expression to dissolve into the storytelling, actually enhancing the book.I hope publishers  and authors  understand the value of hiring a pro.FRANK KENNABRANFORD, CONN.*Wheres Sam?To the Editor:The headline Beckett in Hiding, with the review of Jo Bakers novel A Country Road, a Tree (May 22), had special meaning for me. In October 1969, when I was teaching creative writing and world literature aboard Chapman Colleges World Campus Afloat, the ship came to port in Tunis. Knowing that Samuel Beckett was hiding out there to avoid the Nobel Prize committee, I gave my students an assignment called Looking for Beckett: They were to find the writer and bring him back to the ship. They never succeeded, but they did find James Baldwin and persuaded him to come and talk to the class. I gave them all an A.GARY MIRANDAPORTLAND, ORE.The writer is a former poet in residence at Reed College."}
{"text": "Silicon Valley tech titans. Canadian hockey players. African sheikhs. Muhammad Alis athletic might, bold politics and boundless charisma extended his influence far beyond the world of championship boxing. And as news of his death broke, each of these people  and many more  shared their condolences on social media.Ali was a three-time world heavyweight boxing champion and many who mourned him online were fellow athletic titans. One of the first to respond to his death was the controversial boxing champion Mike Tyson.Ali converted from Christianity to Islam in the 1960s and his death was keenly felt among Muslims in the United States and abroad. On Friday, before Ali died, the Arab-American novelist Saladin Ahmed reflected on his place in Muslim America.After his death, Ismail Menk, the Grand Mufti of Zimbabwe, the African countrys highest Islamic religious authority, tweeted his condolences to Alis family, as did Nazem Kadri, a Muslim-Canadian hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Linda Sarsour, a Muslim-American civil rights activist.As a public speaker, Ali was able to both amuse and inspire, whether in delivering a pointed political critique, or using wit and charm to telegraph his brash self-confidence. Many people shared some of his well-known sayings on social media.And, perhaps unsurprisingly, Donald J. Trump, the famously Twitter-friendly presumptive Republican presidential candidate (who has proposed to bar Muslims from entering the United States), was one of the first people tweet about Alis death."}
{"text": "PARIS  The Tennis Integrity Unit found no evidence of corrupt activity in its investigation into a mixed doubles match at the Australian Open in January that raised suspicions of possible match fixing  a finding that clears the players involved but raises further doubts about the effectiveness of the sports anticorruption efforts.No further action will be taken against any player involved, said Mark Harrison, a spokesman for the unit, who divulged no further details, including when the investigation had been abandoned.The match, a first-round encounter pitting David Marrero and Lara Arruabarrena against Lukasz Kubot and Andrea Hlavackova, had been flagged by bookmakers hours before it began for suspicious betting patterns, with Pinnacle Sports suspending wagering on the match after unusually large and lopsided betting activity on Kubot and Hlavackova. The aggregator site Oddsportal showed that at least 22 other betting companies  including Bovada, BoyleSports and Ladbrokes  also disabled betting on the match in the hours before it began.When the match was played, Kubot and Hlavackova won quickly, 6-0, 6-3. In an interview immediately after the match, Marrero and Arruabarrena both denied the possibility of any improper influence on the match.Match fixing had been a prevailing topic during this years Australian Open after a joint report from the BBC and BuzzFeed on the first day of the tournament highlighted the perceived ineffectiveness of the Tennis Integrity Unit, the sports watchdog body.Despite the spotlight, and the warning signs surrounding the mixed doubles match in question, the Tennis Integrity Unit seemed slow to act. In February, the Melbourne newspaper The Age reported that Marrero, who had a pattern of losses with suspect betting patterns, had been allowed to leave the country without being interviewed in person, and that the integrity unit sent him an email days later asking him not to delete anything off his phone. In a post for the website Tennis Topic, Arruabarrena said she had learned that the match was a topic of interest outside her postmatch interview only after she had left Australia, when her phone was flooded with messages during a stopover at the Dubai airport.Despite calls for greater transparency, the work of the Tennis Integrity Unit remains opaque. (It acknowledged that there had been an investigation into Marrero only after he told The Wall Street Journal last week that it had been resolved.) Before the Australian Open had ended, an independent review had been commissioned to investigate the effectiveness of tenniss anticorruption efforts. In April, the unit published a brief digest of statistics for flagged matches in the first quarter of the year.The most recent consequence of an investigation by the unit came for the French player Constant Lestienne, whose wild card into the French Open was revoked after a minor breach of the anticorruption program was discovered: He had placed a wager of 2.90 euros on last years French Open final between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka. Lestienne correctly placed the sum on Wawrinka, winning 1.40 euros. When his entry into this years French Open was revoked, Lestienne forfeited 30,000 euros.Punishments in the most prominent cases appear scant. One of the most scrutinized cases  of recent years centered on a match lost by the Ukrainian Denys Molchanov in February 2015 at a challenger-level tournament in Dallas. Bettors monitoring the match noticed money quickly flooding in on Molchanovs opponent, Agustin Velotti, despite Molchanovs leading and winning the first set. With social media chatter about a potential fix growing, hundreds tuned in to a live stream to witness the spectacle, and found Molchanov flailing about the court and ultimately losing.Molchanov, who insisted he was bothered by an injury that limited his movement during the match, said in an interview that the Tennis Integrity Unit never reached out to him, despite the attention. Instead, he said, he ultimately contacted the unit on his own. Molchanov and the unit corresponded by email, he said, but never met face to face until 11 months after the match, in Australia this year.Several other players who have been involved in matches that generated whispers of possible fixes said the unit never contacted them, either. Others who have dutifully reported invitations to fix the outcome of a match said their messages to the unit were never responded to or followed up on.Molchanov acknowledged frequently receiving solicitations to fix matches.A criminal is always dangerous, but no one will kill you if you just walk away, Molchanov said. They can text you and you walk away. What can they do? Theyre not going to kill you for that."}

{"text": "The Meaning of Life: Its summer reading time, which on the best-seller lists naturally means ... science? Yes, indeed: The Gene, Siddhartha Mukherjees intimate history of heredity and its mechanisms, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No.1, joining a string of recent science-themed hits including Hope Jahrens Lab Girl (No.19 on the extended list), Carlo Rovellis Seven Brief Lessons on Physics (No.11 after 11 weeks) and Sean Carrolls The Big Picture (No.15 after two weeks). I asked Carroll, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, how he accounted for this sudden interest. People recognize that science plays a crucial role in shaping the world around them, so it makes sense to be familiar with its methods and conclusions, he said. We all have a basic human curiosity about the world. So when somebody writes about science in a way that is simultaneously engaging and informative, there will always be an audience.[This weeks best-seller lists.]Carrolls book isnt limited to questions of physics. Our contemporary discourse tends to proceed as if scientific discoveries have no direct implications for how we live our lives or the meaning of our existence, he said. I think this separation is false, which was a big reason I wrote my book. I always intended it to wander far outside of physics, to include issues in philosophy, biology, neuroscience and other areas. Im not an expert in all of those areas  but then again, nobody else is either. And I think its crucial that there be a dialogue among them. My goal is not to tell philosophers or biologists or neuroscientists how to do their jobs; rather, I want to sketch out how all of the different fields can be consistent in the attempt to describe our underlying universe. The grandiose subtitle of my book  On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself  isnt meant to imply that I, or anyone else, actually has the answers. The point is that we have assembled, over the last few centuries, a reliable framework in which they can be addressed. Within that framework there are many different ways to talk about the world, from particle physics to why it all matters. Showing how they fit together is just as important as telling the individual stories themselves.Timing Is Everything: The Weekenders, a breezy new novel by Mary Kay Andrews, makes its debut on the hardcover fiction list at No.3. Asked in a recent interview to name her greatest literary ambition, Andrews replied: To write the very best book Im capable of. Every time. And not have it released the same week as the latest James Patterson.Note: Readers who visit our best-seller pages online will find an updated design this week, starting with a snazzier interface that shows the book jackets alongside each title and makes it easier to navigate among lists. The data, though, hasnt changed. As they say in the food business: New look, same great taste!"}

{"text": "Is your retirement plan set up to benefit you, or your employer?Such a question may seem out of place. After all, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa, requires overseers of 401(k) plans and other benefit programs to ensure they are run safely, soundly and in participants best interests.But class-action lawsuits against retirement plan sponsors in recent years have generated significant payouts, and legal experts say some employers are responding by modifying the terms of their plans. The goal? To help shield them from litigation.Changes that companies have made to their programs include reducing the amount of time a participant has to bring a legal action and requiring that such an action be brought in a court that is convenient to the plan sponsor but not necessarily to a beneficiary. This is known as forum selection.Such requirements do more than make it harder for beneficiaries to receive the benefits they are owed, said Norman Stein, a law professor at Drexel University and a senior policy adviser at the Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit consumer organization in Washington. They also prevent participants from holding plan overseers accountable.Its been a slowly growing problem from the perspective of participants, Mr. Stein said in an interview. If you have a plan and you want to do everything you can to immunize yourself against suits, you can take these measures.Such immunization is possible because of how Erisa was written and how courts interpret it, Mr. Stein explained.On most of the work done by entities overseeing retirement or health benefit plans, the law imposes a fiduciary duty, requiring them to put participants interests first.But some plan sponsor activities  creating and designing a plan, for example, or deciding to terminate one  are not governed by a fiduciary standard. These are known as settlor functions.Plan sponsors, therefore, wear two hats: one as a settlor, another as a fiduciary. And when a sponsor changes a plans terms  a settlor function  it may not be required to put its beneficiaries interests first.In legal circles, this is known as the settlor/fiduciary doctrine. And federal courts have ruled in favor of plan sponsors who have changed the terms of their programs in ways that some lawyers say are inconsistent with the fiduciary standard.Benefit plans offered to employees of Kodak are an example. In its materials, Kodak outlines numerous procedures a participant must follow to bring a legal action against the plan. These include a requirement that all suits be filed in federal court near Kodaks headquarters in Rochester, unless the plan administrator agrees to a different forum.Lawsuits must also be filed within 90 days of a claims being denied, and if litigants lose a case, they must pay all the Kodak plans fees and expenses incurred defending against the suit.Asked about these restrictions, Louise Kehoe, a Kodak spokeswoman, provided the following statement: By giving employees a streamlined administrative process and directing any matters that cannot be resolved internally to the Federal District Court in Rochester, Kodak promotes consistent, affordable handling of any issues that arise. Likewise, in keeping with a widespread practice recently affirmed by the Supreme Court, Kodak has established and publicized clear deadlines for claimants with questions or concerns to take action, to ensure that matters can be resolved while records are available and memories are fresh.Law firms have also begun advising plan sponsors on how to protect themselves against lawsuits involving their benefit programs.When designing Erisa plans, limiting liability is an important priority, stated a March 2015 report from the law firm Proskauer Rose to its clients. Fortunately, plan sponsors have certain tools at their disposal that can potentially reduce the risk of being sued, or being liable if a suit is brought.Among the tools described in the article are those employed by Kodak, including shortening the time a participant has to bring a suit and specifying the forum in which legal action can be brought.Officials at the Labor Department, whose Employee Benefits Security Administration unit enforces benefit plan rules, say they are concerned about companies erecting barriers that make it harder for participants to receive what they are due. They call it a growing problem that hurts participants with limited financial resources, among them people who are already retired, on disability or in ill health.Health and retirement benefits are critically important to workers physical and financial well-being, said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor, in a statement. When participants believe they have been wrongly denied benefits, they should have ready access to impartial judicial review. The best way to defend benefit decisions is to make sound decisions, not to stack the deck against employees day in court.Forum selection clauses like the one in the Kodak plan are among the Labor Departments concerns. In friend of the court briefs, the department has argued that these clauses are inconsistent with Erisas goal of removing obstacles for plan participants seeking their full benefits. The arguments have not always been successful, however.A further appeal of these litigation-protection measures is that companies face little downside when they add hurdles to their plans. Participants who must pay to bring legal challenges have much more to lose.Jerome J. Schlichter, a partner at Schlichter Bogard & Denton in St. Louis, has scored numerous victories for beneficiaries in recent suits against retirement plan sponsors. Most of his cases involved breaches of fiduciary duties, such as offering only high-fee investment options in a plan.In some of these suits, plan sponsors have argued that because such investment options were written into plan documents  a settlor function  they had no liability for choices that were not in the best interests of beneficiaries.Mr. Schlichter has prevailed against these arguments. But the legal process is onerous for plan participants.I believe that these attempts to convert fiduciary conduct to settlor functions and obtain immunity from fiduciary breaches will be unsuccessful in courts, Mr. Schlichter said in an interview. But if companies do this, it creates more burdens on participants and more challenges for them to go about enforcing the law.Mr. Stein of the Pension Rights Center agreed. And he noted another risk to plan participants: a race to the bottom in benefit programs.There may be a relapse toward less than stellar behavior, Mr. Stein said, if employers think their plans are immunized against suits."}
{"text": "SALEM, Ore.  A parade of Republican-controlled states in recent years has made it more difficult to cast a ballot, imposing strict identification requirements at polling stations, paring back early-voting periods and requiring proof of citizenship to register.Then there is Oregon. It is leading what could become a march in the opposite direction.From January through April, Oregon added nearly 52,000 new voters to its rolls by standing the usual voter-registration process on its head. Under a new law, most citizens no longer need to fill out and turn in a form to become a voter. Instead, everyone who visits a motor-vehicle bureau and meets the requirements is automatically enrolled. Choosing a political party  or opting out entirely  is a matter of checking off preferences on a postcard mailed later to registrants homes.With the change, Oregon now boasts perhaps the nations most painless electoral process; mail-in ballots long ago did away with polling places snaking lines and balky voting machinesWhether painless equals effective, however, is another question. For while officials here hope automatic registration fuels a jump in voter turnout, the results of experiments elsewhere and the statistics from last months Oregon presidential primary  the first in which the new voters could cast ballots  have been decidedly mixed. Getting more people registered, it seems, does not necessarily mean getting more people to vote.Regardless, Oregons example is gaining traction. California, Vermont, West Virginia, and this week Illinois have followed Oregon in enacting automatic-registration laws; none have yet been put in effect. Twenty-three other states and the District of Columbia have considered similar measures since last year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York Universitys School of Law.I think states like Oregon, West Virginia and the others deserve a lot of credit for trying to bring voting rights into the 21st century, said David Becker, the director of election initiatives for the Pew Charitable Trusts.Yet in a year when voting is as much a partisan football as a patriotic duty, even the civics book notion of expanding the electoral franchise has a political cast. To many conservatives, automatic registration is largely a Democratic pushback to a wave of voting restrictions enacted by Republican state legislators who claim to be combating voter fraud. Most experts say the kind of fraud the laws are said to target barely exists.Just as Republicans may assume  and sometimes say outright  that voting restrictions depress Election Day turnout of students, minorities and other traditionally Democratic constituencies, Democrats may assume that expanding registration will bring more of those same voters into their fold.When you get people living in poverty, people of color, young people registered, yes, they tend to vote progressively, Jennifer Williamson, the Democratic majority leader of the Oregon House of Representatives, said in an interview. But regardless of what the outcome is, removing the barriers for people to vote is the right thing to do.Excepting West Virginia, the states that have enacted auto-registration laws are controlled by Democrats. A Chicago-based group mounting a nationwide campaign for the laws is headed by former political strategists for President Obama, who also has urged the states to follow Oregons lead.Oregons bill became law without a single Republican vote. So did Californias. And while Vermont and West Virginia registration laws won bipartisan backing, some analysts suggest that was partly because those states have too few unregistered minorities to be points of political dispute.If automatic registration gains steam nationally, however, the impact could be sizable.The Census Bureau says that at least 41.1 million of the 219 million people eligible to vote in 2014 were not registered. California alone had roughly 6.6 million eligible but unregistered voters as of last October, state officials said.Enrolling them could conceivably change the political landscape. While the majority are white, census data show they are also disproportionately Asian and Hispanic, lower-income and young. Other studies indicate they are less educated and less engaged with politics and their communities than are regular voters.While those characteristics often fit Democratic voters, that is not always so. Lower-income, less-educated white voters, for example, are reliably Republican and are strong supporters of Donald J. Trumps presidential bid.Whatever their leanings, the crucial question is whether they will turn out on Election Day. The answer is unclear.Samuel S. Wang, a Princeton University professor of neuroscience and a longstanding elections analyst, leads the optimists. He notes that participation in programs like organ donation and savings plans rises dramatically when people have to opt out of them instead of opting in.In jurisdictions that allow Election Day registration at polling stations  a method almost as simple as automatic registration  average turnout is 7.8 percentage points above the national average, he said. Were automatic voter registration to generate the same increase, the electorate would gain 14.7 million voters.It will potentially have a larger increase than any amount of shoe-leather get-out-the-vote, he wrote in an email.But many experts are skeptical. The citizens swept on to the rolls by automatic registration, they say, are by definition those who have not made voting a priority. And the political landscape is littered with electoral fillips that had little impact on Americans sorry electoral behavior.Most studies show that election reforms dont affect turnout very much, and when they do, the people who turn out look a lot like the people who are already voting, said Barry C. Burden, the director of the University of Wisconsin-Madisons Elections Research Center.The 1993 National Voter Registration Act  the motor voter law  aimed to increase registration by requiring motor vehicle and public-assistance offices to offer patrons a chance to enroll as voters. But one study concluded that motor-vehicle bureau registrations have remained fairly constant, even as the population has increased.Voting by mail vastly simplifies casting a ballot, and the states that mandate it  Oregon, Colorado and Washington  have turnout rates well above the national norm.Yet states from Mississippi to Minnesota have comparable or even higher turnout. And studies in California and Washington suggested that mail-in ballots generally raise turnout only when combined with other get-out-the-vote efforts.Delawares electronic registration system is all but automatic: computers flag unregistered motor-vehicle bureau customers, and clerks offer them a paperless registration process that requires only a signature on an electronic pad.The states elections commissioner, Elaine Manlove, raves about it. We have no paper anymore, she said. It freed up tons of office space and made things faster.But from 2010 to 2015, state records indicate, Delaware added only about 26,000 Democrats and independents  and lost 2,853 Republicans. Thats an increase of less than 4 percent.And Oregon? Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins says the jury is still out.By one measure, citizens greeted auto-registration with a yawn. Of the 55,092 Oregonians automatically enrolled at motor-vehicle offices through April 30, only 12,621 mailed back postcards regarding their registration status  and about one in three asked to be deregistered.Of those who chose a party, 4,776 ticked the Democratic checkbox, a share considerably greater than the partys 41 percent share statewide. Another 2,671 became Republicans, well below the partys 28 percent share.Jim Moore, a political-science professor and election analyst at Oregons Pacific University, said election reforms like mail-in balloting have triggered similar bumps in Democratic registration or turnout, but that they were short-lived. In the long run, everything settles into its demographic place and the electorate reflects who we are as a people, he said. This doesnt say anything about the next election.The good news was that those voters turned out in droves to support their presidential candidates, in proportions roughly equal to Democratic and Republican turnout statewide. But unaffiliated voters  those who never returned a postcard  all but stayed home. Although unaffiliated voters could not vote in the presidential primaries, more than one in five statewide still cast ballots in nonpartisan races. Among those who were automatically registered, however, the number was closer to 1 in 16.Ms. Atkins, the secretary of state, said any genuine impact of the registration changes will be clear only after more voters are automatically enrolled and can vote in elections open to everyone. The voters enrolled through April comprise less than 2 percent of the states registered voters. We have a lot to learn over the next several election cycles, she said, but I think we can say so far, so good."}

I asked people about what theyre looking forward to should that time materialize.Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said he was eager to read C.E.

Who can resist a book that Dwight Garner says is so compelling it could sustain a television mini-series?Ben Brantley, The Timess chief theater critic, has a new release and a classic lined up. Just now  amid the surreal and petty squalor of this election year  Im feeling an aching need for the sort of big-picture (as in life and death) perspective that Don DeLillo provides, so Im delighted that his Zero K is waiting for me, he said. And I plan to quench my summer thirst for stormy 19th-century passion and thwarted psyches by finally rereading Charlotte Bronts strange, anguished Villette, which left me reeling when I first encountered it in college.Stephanie Danlers debut novel, Sweetbitter, has caught the eye of Maria Russo, the Book Reviews childrens books editor. I have the impression this book about a young, yearning waitress is the literary equivalent of a sit-down lunch at a nice downtown restaurant: sophisticated but not too fancy, just the thing to shore up my waning faith that some of the time-tested pleasures can still be had even in a radically transformed Manhattan, Russo said. Parul Sehgal, the Book Reviews senior editor, named The End of Days, a gloomy and tricksy novel by the German writer Jenny Erpenbeck, which was published in translation in 2014 and has acquired a kind of cultlike following.

Hawley has written five novels, starting with A Conspiracy of Tall Men in 1998, but hes become famous in recent years as the creator and showrunner of the TV series Fargo. Hes now adapting Kurt Vonneguts Cats Cradle for the small screen. Conventional wisdom has it that TV is taken more seriously now than ever, which makes it a fitting home for Vonnegut, who often fought for respectability. In 1963, Terry Southern reviewed Cats Cradle in these pages, concluding: It is work of a far more engaging and meaningful order than the melodramatic tripe which most critics seem to consider serious."}

{"text": "RE: TRUMPRobert Draper traveled with the Trump campaign in the weeks before the Indiana primary as both America and Trump himself began to come to terms with the fact that he would most likely secure the G.O.P. nomination.Many stories have already been written on Trump. I am baffled and deeply disappointed that the loud male dominates over the brilliant female in Times coverage. Hillary Clinton is the first woman who will likely be a nominee for president. She has had a brilliant career to date. Is there nothing interesting to write about? The First Words column on the meaning of presidential briefly touched on how a female president might change that perception, but it would have made for a much more interesting focus. What about a piece on the women in Hillarys life, her childhood, her college years? How about a definitive review of all of the Benghazi investigations that have revealed no wrongdoing on Hillarys part? An article on the unique qualities of women in powerful government roles would be a fascinating read. Audrey Rabinowitz, Chappaqua, N.Y.Most of Donalds quotes in this article can be summed up in two ideas:I win/won XYZ.I have the best XYZ.He sounds like a child, desperate for attention. Being president is so much more complicated than that, and the fact that people dont seem to realize it is astonishing. Managing a hotel and a golf course is not running a country; he has no knowledge at all of the world or how government works.I wouldnt want a chef doing my surgery just because hes held a knife anymore than I would want Donald Trump running my country just because hes owned a business. Holly Belli, Glen Ridge, N.J.RE: CANCERFor the Health Issue, we considered the new anatomy of cancer in several articles.Almost 30 years after my own cancer diagnosis, and a lifetime as an advocate, it mattered a lot to hear the new cancer leaders Siddhartha Mukherjee and Jochen Lorch talking about the moral consequences of personalized medicine. The cancer issue so thoughtfully explored how both health care professionals and patients see this new frontier as a bold shift away from the one size fits all cancer care of the past to focusing on both the individual and the individuals DNA.Building public trust and confidence is key to being able to collect the molecular data that is the foundation of personalized medicine, and to ensure that new health technologies are made available in a timely and equitable manner. This is the future every cancer patient and every oncologist wants. Pat Kelly, Asheville, N.C.I was riveted by the clear, concise language in the cancer issue. For many of us, the word cancer itself generates fear and anguish. I read the words non-Hodgkin lymphoma and immediately think of my father who, 30 years ago this month, underwent his last chemotherapy treatment a month before slowly walking me down the aisle at my wedding; he passed away a year later. I think of my husband, diagnosed with the same type of cancer 12 years ago, receiving treatment in Manhattan. I remember finding parking early in the morning, and then driving him home in the dark after his long chemotherapy treatments. Hes well, and Ive now mastered the art of alternate-side-of-the-street parking.However, within the brief, precise descriptions of the various types of cancer and reading the excruciating yet hopeful stories of cancer victims and their families, I felt a sense of calm and empowerment. I realized that cancer itself doesnt always mean suffering and death. It can also connote strength, bravery and hope. Anne G. Barretta, Cresskill, N.J.When Do You Give Up on Treating a Child With Cancer is a remarkable story. This beautiful article reinforces the notion that people with cancer forever live with uncertainty, and hope should never be abandoned. In my practice as a psychiatrist, I witness many giving up hope prematurely based on demoralization from poor prognoses that are frequently defied. In Andrews case, the decision to switch to palliative treatment was the most humane choice at the time. Continued advancement of science and the artful application of it can keep curative hopes alive for children like Andrew. Jeffrey B. Freedman, New York"}
{"text": "If the weather hadnt been so foul, the most dramatic moment of Tiffany Mallorys wedding to Jerrell Moore would never have happened.It had been pouring, and then it stopped raining but turned cold and windy right as we started the ceremony, said Mrs. Mallory Moore, who was married April 2 before 140 guests on the back lawn of the Mint Museum in Charlotte, N.C.Just as she arrived through the squall to meet her groom at the altar, a gust blew her veil into the sky. It went flying, right off my head, she said. But Im over six feet tall, so people thought it looked very glamorous.During a very wet April and May on the East Coast, many couples learned the hard way that a perfect (or at least nearly perfect) wedding does not require perfect weather.Did my guests get wet? Yes, kind of, said Minoo Fadaifard Wade, who married John Wade in a drizzle on May 21 at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in front of a crowd of 82. It was chilly, too. But nobody complained. Everybody made the best of it. We were all lighthearted.Should rain clouds threaten your wedding, here are some tips on how to salvage that perfect day, provided by couples who have managed to do just that.Rain was expected on May 22, the day Jill Jacinto, 30, was to marry Sander van den Bergh, 31, on the outdoor terrace of Battery Gardens, a New York restaurant. But she held out hope that the day would clear by the ceremonys 4:30 p.m. start time.I gave up on checking weather.com the night before and assumed an indoor ceremony was in our future and out of our hands, said Ms. Jacinto, an associate director at an investment firm. But then 30 minutes before the start time, the sun came out. The couple was able to swiftly switch from their Plan B  an on-site sheltered space  to the patio, their Plan A. We ended up with a gorgeous ceremony, Ms. Jacinto said. But we were ready for whatever happened.At Mariana Rodrigues and David Rothschilds May 21 wedding at Cherry Hill in Central Park, rain began falling as guests boarded double-decker buses bound for a reception at the NoMad Hotel. The bus driver was really kind and offered everyone on the upper deck ponchos, but I was pretty upset, said Mrs. Rothschild, 32, a former financial executive. Then I was upset with myself for being upset, and David reminded me that that was absolutely warranted, that I was allowed to have that moment.She did not let the moment last, though. I realized it wasnt perfect but it was a great celebration, she said. You have to remember that the weather is out of your control, and just enjoy yourself.Erin McGrail and Elliot Fleming invited 150 guests to their June 2014 wedding under a stately oak tree at the Destrehan Plantation, just outside New Orleans. Thirty minutes before the ceremony, the sky turned black. Then it just started pouring torrentially in that typical New Orleans way, Mrs. Fleming, 28, said.Instead of panicking as she watched friends and family run for shelter at a gift shop, she played it cool. At first I took it badly, Mrs. Fleming said. Then I saw how upset my mom was. So I said to myself, Stay calm, we can figure this out.The wedding was moved to the reception site nearby, where guests were seated at decorated tables. But it didnt matter: At that point I had just accepted it for what it was, said Mrs. Fleming, who works in purchasing at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans. Looking back, she added, she wouldnt change a thing.Your state of mind is going to determine your guests state of mind, said Constantino Khalaf. Mr. Khalaf, 36, married David Khalaf, 38, on May 14 in Cathedral Park in Portland, Ore., the couples hometown, under drizzly skies with the occasional hard rain. There was no shelter for their 65 guests.We warned people far in advance to bring their umbrellas and raincoats, because we knew getting married in May in Portland was like playing Russian roulette with the weather, said David Khalaf, who runs the Christian website Modern Kinship with his husband.Then they made the best of it. During the reception, held at the wedding site, We all huddled together to stay warm, and we danced in the rain, he said. If youre just like, Hey, this is a beautiful occasion, lets dance in the rain, everybody is going to pick up on that,The first advice I would give is: Ask all your vendors what their rain policies are, and read the contracts closely, said Mrs. Mallory Moore, the bride whose veil wouldnt stay put and who is also an assistant United States attorney with the Western District of North Carolina.That includes contracts with musicians. Some live musicians who play string instruments wont play in dampness, she said. We had a trio of horn players, so it worked out for us. But it might not have if we had a violinist.She also was not sure how her florist would handle broken vases; several were smashed in the storm. The couple was not charged. But you really have to pay attention to that stuff, Mrs. Mallory Moore said.Rachel Bowie felt personally responsible when the rain started coming down on May 13 at Janes Carousel in Brooklyn, where 99 guests had gathered to watch her and Matthew Dorville get married. It was Friday the 13th. We sort of asked for it, she said. But she was glad she remembered a tip from her photographer: buy a lot of clear umbrellas. They dont cast a shadow on your face, said Mrs. Bowie, 33, an editor who lives in Brooklyn. If she had to do it over again, she would have asked a friend to pack galoshes for her, too. Right before I walked down the aisle my shoes were so wet I was slipping in them. I had been jumping through those gross, deceptively deep New York City puddles.Hurricane Irene was an uninvited guest at the August 2011 wedding of Jacqueline Shea and Matthew Bailey of Eatontown, N.J. When the bride was getting her nails done in preparation for the rehearsal dinner, an evacuation was ordered for an area that included the wedding site on the beach near Asbury Park.I was in denial, like, this is not happening, said Mrs. Bailey, 35, a teacher of the deaf. The couple married that night at a local restaurant. Flowers were assembled from Trader Joe's, and the brides mother bought a sheet cake from ShopRite.Then, vendors refused to refund deposits for the wedding. A year later, the couple appeared on Anderson Coopers short-lived talk show, Anderson, ostensibly to warn other couples about the need to buy wedding insurance.Instead, Mr. Cooper announced that the show was giving them a wedding redo, including a reception at the Wilshire Grand Hotel in West Orange, N.J., and a trip to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, to renew their vows on the beach.The Baileys now have two children, ages 1 and 2, and more perspective on wedding-day disasters.I think what happened to us is sort of like a precursor to what everybody finds out once theyre married, Mrs. Bailey said. And thats that there are ups and there are downs in married life, sometimes big ones. What you do is you make the most of it, no matter what."}
{"text": "Q. When did you know you wanted to be a surgeon?A. I knew as a little girl watching the surgeons on the TV show MASH. Even though they didnt look like me, I liked their ability to help someone who was injured or sick and almost immediately change the persons health status. At the same time, my parents bought a set of encyclopedias that came with a medical encyclopedia as a bonus book, and I liked the transparencies of bones, muscles and blood vessels.You had a double mastectomy yourself in 2013. How did that change the way you approach your job?As a physician, I better understood what I was really asking of my patients. Its one thing to say, O.K., get your diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, M.R.I. and PET/CT scan, and Id like to see you back here in a week. But in real life that can be a tremendous burden to patients, especially depending on the resources they have. It also helped me rethink how we could support patients better. Also, I struggled trying to figure out what my advocacy should be.What did you decide?First, that I would share my unique cancer experience as a survivor and health care provider to all those groups that were interested, including our community, faith-based and health fair partners, as well as survivor and medical organizations. Second, that I would focus my advocacy on sharing my experience of health disparities and the need for patients to participate in research as an investment in the future.What were you like as a patient?When my late mother was diagnosed with lung cancer, the one thing I learned from her is that its O.K. to let people who love and care about you take care of you when you really need it and are vulnerable. If I hadnt had that experience, I would probably not have been a good patient, but I was determined to let go and not direct my care.What is the favorite part of your job?Spending time with my patients and getting to know them as people. The operating room is my oasis where I am most comfortable, but outside of that, being with my patients and knowing I have an impact is the best part of my job."}
{"text": "When Tidjane Thiam took over at Credit Suisse last July, he laid out a new direction for a financial giant with a storied investment banking history: Do less investment banking.And he used forceful language in doing so. He has referred to once core businesses  such as trading in distressed bonds and derivatives  as ugly ducklings. He has suggested publicly that traders increased their investments in risky debt without his knowledge.Instead, Mr. Thiam said, the firm should dedicate itself to cultivating billionaires in China, Indonesia and Africa. The message: The future for the company is in managing the wealth of others.One year in, Credit Suisse stock is down 50 percent. And the investment bank, the second largest in Switzerland after UBS, is in open revolt.Credit Suisse has a wide range of businesses, like overseeing the fortunes of billionaires and managing initial public offerings for technology companies. But for decades, the bank has been dominated, both culturally and financially, by a richly paid banking elite. These deal makers in New York and London are now furious at Mr. Thiam, not just for cutting their pay but also because they resent his blaming them for the $6 billion in losses that the firm has suffered on his watch.Across Europe, banking giants like Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland have, to varying degrees, moved away from traditional investment banking activities because of increased regulation and volatile markets. Sluggish growth in large European economies  not to mention the remarkable phenomenon of negative interest rates  have not helped matters, either.But what makes the situation at Credit Suisse stand out is that Mr. Thiam appears to have done little to cloak his disdain for these activities. The question is not whether Mr. Thiam is right to grab power and capital from these declining businesses but whether his blunt, domineering style as a change agent will end up alienating bankers instead of winning them over.It is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic, said Guy Moszkowski, a longtime securities analyst at Autonomous Research.By any measure, Mr. Thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank. Born to a prominent family in Ivory Coast, he cut short a career at McKinsey & Company in Paris in 1994 to join a reform-minded government in his home country as a top banker and minister.Following a military coup in 1999, Mr. Thiam returned to McKinsey, and in 2009, he was named chief executive of Prudential, the British insurance conglomerate  becoming the first African to head a major listed company in Britain.Six-foot-four and snugly tailored, Mr. Thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools. He had a successful run at Prudential (no relation to an American company with a similar name), overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the Asian operations of the American International Group. Along the way, he became one of Londons more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global get-togethers.That he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise. There needs to be a cultural change, he said in a televised interview in March, in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay. A lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs.In turn, deal makers in London and New York, who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly 40 percent, are not hiding their dislike of the man.More than any other bank on Wall Street, Credit Suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses, allocating large chunks in company stock, which has halved in value. So when their new chief executive gave a speech in May and said that Credit Suisses stock price reflected reality, bankers, especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades, could not believe it.On Credit Suisses newly renovated trading floor in New York, several bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, grumbled that Mr. Thiam had lost the building, which is Wall Street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders. And when he has appeared on television in recent months, employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen, according those bankers, who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly.Mr. Thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in New York last year, but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier, said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly. In particular, many at Credit Suisse find Mr. Thiams personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low.This is particularly true when compared with Brady W. Dougan, his low-key predecessor: Mr. Thiams own dealings with the media are handled by a British firm, Powerscourt. He enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in London and Davos, Switzerland. And he recently purchased a luxury home in Herrliberg, an exclusive lakeside enclave in Zurich.To be sure, analysts agree that Credit Suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like Deutsche Bank as a profit center. Instead, Mr. Thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firms private bankers in Asia, by providing loans to palm-oil magnates in Indonesia or helping billionaire clients in China with initial public offerings.Mr. Thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies. He has been to China and broader Asia at least four times in his new capacity, and his business cards carry a Mandarin translation on the back.Mr. Thiams defenders say that with the future of Credit Suisse in doubt, he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from well-compensated traders and bankers should not deter him. And it is also true that wealth managers in Switzerland and Asia, where Mr. Thiam is adding resources, are embracing the new strategy.Following last years losses, he also asked his board for a 40 percent cut in his bonus, taking in $4.5 million for the six months he worked last year.To date, the Credit Suisse board appears to be standing with Mr. Thiam. Indeed, having had two Wall Street chiefs since 2001, the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like Mr. Thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it.Nevertheless, directors were not happy with his televised comments in March when Mr. Thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him. Mr. Thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached, though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment. Mr. Thiam also called these distressed-debt traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a clarification of his remarks.The board is 100 percent behind the strategy, Tidjane and the executive board, said Richard E. Thornburgh, a former Credit Suisse banker with 30 years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the boards risk committee.With morale in New York at a low point, Mr. Thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders, hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients. For many, though, this is easier said than done. It is unusual, after all, for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firms revenue.That is particularly true on Wall Street, where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm, as productive bankers head for the exits in droves. Over the last six months, at least 18 bankers and traders have left the firm, with many of these coming from Credit Suisses once prestigious technology unit in San Francisco.The culture clash at Credit Suisse recalls a similar dispute at Morgan Stanley a decade ago. Like Mr. Thiam, Philip J. Purcell was a former whiz kid consultant from McKinsey who preferred slow and steady brokers over bankers with big egos and even bigger paychecks. A banker-led uprising forced Mr. Purcells departure, since power on Wall Street was then still in the hands of deal makers and traders.With wealth managers now ascendant, Mr. Thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed. Is there a vision. Is there a direction? Mr. Thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy. The Germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end."}
{"text": "Never too late to come back.So sayeth the High Swearengen, ministering to his followers but speaking in particular to a certain disfigured member of his flock. It was a clever bit of sermonizing, applying both to its targets potential for salvation within the story as well as his renewed purpose, overall, in the world of Game of Thrones.For Sandor Clegane, also known as the Hound, who has not been seen since the end of Season 4, has returned. Youll recall that he was beaten nearly to death and tossed off a cliff by Brienne, who then let Arya escape anyway. Some time later, we learned Sunday, the roving warrior-turned-septon played by Ian McShane discovered and nursed him back to health. It was unclear how he did it or where they had all ended up. The group seemed to be building a church in a pastoral field but everyone was apparently wiped out by a rather prickly Brotherhood Without Banners contingent before they could explain what they were up to.The big Hound reveal was less surprising than it might have been, thanks to Mr. McShanes letting some clues slip a few months ago. (The resulting hubbub led to the actors memorably terse, but unprintable, description of the show.)But it was still fun to again see the Hound, who showed up looking perhaps worse for the wear. Who could tell, really? The man was never in this tale for his beauty  whats important is that hes still strong and he feels as if he has some atoning to do. Oh, and he has an ax. That could come into play at some point.The return of the Hound, revealed in a rare cold open, provided the spine of an episode that was largely about alliances productive and wearying, newly forged and torn asunder. As Sansa and Jon Snow tried to drum up support in the North, Arya dealt with the consequences of cutting ties with the Faceless Men. As Jaime worked to counteract the general numbskullery of the idiot Freys at Riverrun, Cersei watched as her former collaborator Lady Olenna called her the worst person Ive ever met on her way out of town.Those crazy Greyjoy siblings, for their part, are eying a new partnership with Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen, which would be good news for multiple reasons. (More on that in a minute.)The alliance between the Hound and Mr. McShanes Brother Ray was the one partnership of the night that wasnt purely transactional, which means it was doomed from the beginning. If you had any doubt, there was Ray, on an undefensible open plain, preaching about the uselessness of violence on one of the most violent shows on television. Violence is a disease, he said. You dont cure a disease by spreading it to more people. Which is true, but there arent many people in this story interested in curing that particular disease.Morality is fluid in Game of Thrones; the one cardinal sin seems to be to refuse to deal with the world as it is. (Ned Stark is the enduring example of this.) Which is to say: this thing was going to go only one way. The real tragedy is that Mr. McShane, almost always the best part of whichever screen hes on, is already gone.And so now, the Hound and his trusty ax are off in search of new alliances. It remains to be seen whether that leads toward revenge on the Brotherhood  they have a complicated history, remember  or Brienne or his undead brother or something else entirely.Arya sure couldve used her old protector this week. Last seen lying in wait for the Waif in the dark  at least thats how it looked to me  Arya on Sunday made travel plans in broad daylight and otherwise behaved in oddly leisurely fashion for a woman who just defied a band of deadly assassins. She strolled around Braavos, taking in the sights, and whats this? A kindly old woman wants to have a word? Soon there were a few new holes in her belly and, a quick swim later, she was bleeding in the streets among a sea of unfriendly faces, any one of which could bring more stabbing.So whats the plan, Arya? I still think were not done with the theater troupe so perhaps someone among them has some medical expertise. (Im sure we all remember the young actor seeking help for his skin problem a few weeks ago.) A key scene from an early trailer found Arya taking a terrific flying leap so perhaps a future escape will make up for this weeks bizarre lack of urgency.A world away, Aryas sister tried to rally the North and only ended up with some Wildlings and 62 Mormont men for her trouble. On the bright side, Wun Wun the giant is among the Wilding supporters  Snow!  and I also wouldnt underestimate the latest formidable female in the story, Little Miss Mini-Mormont.Leave it to Davos, the little girl whisperer, to win her over. (I know it came up a few weeks ago but he doesnt have the whole story of what happened to Shireen, right?) Lyanna Mormont is probably my favorite new character of the season so far, and thats even before you consider that she oversees a place called Bear Island. How did we not get to see more of Bear Island? Throw us a bone, HBO.Sansa was last seen writing a letter to someone, presumably asking for more help. Any guesses who it was? Littlefinger seems like the obvious choice  she appeared pretty joyless about it and we already know he has the knights of the Vale queued up and ready to ride. But what will be his price? Could Sansa (sigh) be in for yet another dispiriting marriage? Is she a Bolton or is she a Lannister? Ive heard conflicting reports, Ms. Mormont said. I do what I have to do, Sansa replied. Would she do it again?Speaking of Lannisters, in Kings Landing, the High Septon has consolidated his power by taking control of the throne, and is now eliminating threats. Last week, he had Jaime sent away. (Yes, Tommen officially did it, but hes a puppet at this point, right?) This week the Sparrow targeted Lady Olenna. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead, he tells Margaery.The Sparrow is loathsome, wrapping in sanctimony the same crass power craving that animates many of the shows characters. But its worth noting how good Jonathan Pryce is at conveying a sense of superficial guilelessness that masks darker undercurrents. A phony man of God (or seven gods) can easily veer into caricature but the Sparrows humility song-and-dance has never wavered, even as his dominion has expanded exponentially.We received confirmation that Margaery is telling the Sparrow and Septa Unella what they want to hear  Margaery signaled her loyalty and warned away the Queen of Thorns with a drawing of a rose, the family sigil. The question is: Is she playing into the Sparrows hands by sending away her grandmother? Not that Margaery had a choice, with the threats on the table. But I suspect the real point is to remove any possible obstacles for the Sparrows control of the royal couple. He already has Cersei ready to face charges  the mother of the king is a potentially powerful adversary  so if he can clear out Olenna, his hold on the king and queen would be secure.Olennas departure also removes yet another former Cersei ally, not that the Olenna has any interest in helping her after their failed coup last week. Still friends? Cersei asks, knowing that without the Tyrells she has little hope of overthrowing the Sparrow. Youve lost, Cersei, Olenna replies, which brings the only joy I can find in all this misery. So that would be a no.Finally, Theon was like the lactose-intolerant guy at the fondue party on Sunday, as Yara and friends indulged in some classic sailors-on-leave behavior. Yara took a quick break for some tough love, telling her brother that she had no time for his post-traumatic stress disorder.I know youve had some bad years, she said, in a riotous bit of understatement before making her point: Get over it or kill yourself.Theon continues to be one of the more interesting characters this season  with Alfie Allen giving him a poignant, hollowed-out quality  because we dont know how hes going to turn out. His past as a feckless cad obliterated, theres no going back to what he was, despite Yaras urging.We received confirmation that the Greyjoys intend to sail to Meereen to offer their services to Dany, as suspected, which is good news for a couple of reasons. One, anything that will expedite a departure from Meereen is welcome. Two, who better than Varys and the Unsullied to help Theon understand that theres life after well, you know? Jaime arrived at the mudpit known as Riverrun and Bronn made his first appearance of the season. (It was a big week for beloved, scraggly bearded dudes.) But otherwise it was all fruitless parleys and doofus Freys. The real action starts with Briennes arrival next week, promised in the preview, at the tent of her old kingslaying crush. As discussed in the episode, Lyanna Mormonts uncle was Jeor Mormont, whom Jon Snow initially served under at Castle Black.

{"text": "Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking seven days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here.Good morning. Dana Goodyear had a fascinating brief in The New Yorker last week on the opening of a more affordable spinoff of the grocer often referred to as Whole Paycheck, in Los Angeles. (The store carries the unwieldy name 365 by Whole Foods Market, and there are 18 more to come.) For those who will shop today  at suburban gigantamarts, at rural farmstands and coastal fishmongers, at crowded specialty grocers, at actual Whole Foods, at farmers markets  it offers a fascinating glimpse at one possible future of food shopping. In Ms. Goodyears words: unambitious, self-satisfied, unimpeachable; swipe left if something causes discomfort. Yikes!But do shop. We have a lot of cooking to do this week.Maybe this evening you could try Pierre Franeys recipe for lamb chili with lentils? And then my recipe for caramelized citrus and yogurt for dessert?On Monday, wed like to make David Taniss new recipe for an Indian-spiced carrot soup with lime. Its good hot and good cold, so if you share our desire, you can make it today and have virtually nothing left to do tomorrow save serving it alongside a chilled bottle of wine.Tuesday night should be a good one  if the fishmonger is still open when we emerge stunned and blinking from our commute  for Nigella Lawsons recipe for pan-roasted fish with toasted almonds. Nigella uses cod. But really any meaty white-fleshed fish will do. I bet it would be fantastic with grouper.For Wednesday, well try to battle the midweek blues with a plate of pork chops in pipian sauce, a dish that goes beautifully with rice and beans. Soundtrack: the banda singer Valentn Elizalde, A Mis Enemigos.On Thursday, well follow the teachings of Mark Bittman and slow-cook some mushrooms in accordance with his recipe for pasta with slow-cooked portobellos. The resulting dish is almost ridiculous in its density of flavors, and should bring cheer to most anyone who makes it.And then on Friday well return to our occasional habit of cooking chicken on Friday nights, and make a recipe weve been turning out to raves since Bobby Flay was making it on the line of his late restaurant Bolo, back at the start of the century: pan-roasted chicken with mint sauce. Oh, my.Many more recipes to cook this week can be found on Cooking. (If you find recipes on some other site, dont forget that you can save them into your Cooking recipe box with ease. Heres how.) Pick out a bunch, then cook them! And if you run into trouble, ask for help. Were at cookingcare@nytimes.com.But before you do? Heres a reading from the book of Travis McGee, The Deep Blue Good-By, by John D. MacDonald, 1964.I do not function too well on emotional motivations. I am wary of them. And I am wary of a lot of other things, such as plastic credit cards, payroll deductions, insurance programs, retirement benefits, savings accounts, Green Stamps, time clocks, newspapers, mortgages, sermons, miracle fabrics, deodorants, check lists, time payments, political parties, lending libraries, television, actresses, junior chambers of commerce, pageants, progress, and manifest destiny.I am wary of the whole dreary deadening structured mess we have built into such a glittering top-heavy structure that there is nothing left to see but the glitter, and the brute routines of maintaining it.I am also wary of all earnestness.Me, too! Have a great week."}

{"text": "For all their grandeur and euphoria, graduation ceremonies can be harrowing. Until that momentous day, youre a student whose job is to do what your teacher asks. Now you have to ask things of yourself  but what?If youre relying on a commencement speaker to set your compass, you may still be confused at days end. In my experience, its common to hear Follow your passion from the podium. This is great counsel if, in fact, you know what that passion is. But what if you dont?Young graduates might imagine that discovering your passion happens the way it does in a movie: with a flash of insight and a trumpet blast. Before that flash, you were struggling to find yourself, and in the next moment, you know exactly who you were meant to be.As a psychologist who studies world-class achievers, I can say the reality of following your passion is not very romantic. It takes time to develop a direction that feels so in-the-bones right that you never want to veer from it.Thus, my advice to young graduates is not to follow your passion but rather, to foster your passion. Here are three suggestions for doing so.Move toward what interests you.Dont panic if you cant think of a career path thats a perfect fit. In large part, this is because interests are not just discovered, theyre developed. Scientists have learned that the sort of enduring fascination that commencement speakers like to praise usually takes time and experience to bloom fully.For instance, when she graduated from Smith College, Julia Child had no idea that she would fall in love with French cuisine in her late 30s. She had no inkling that writing cookbooks and teaching on television would one day become her calling.A good-enough fit is a more reasonable aim than a perfect one. Consider your first job as an opportunity to begin an unpredictable, inefficient trial-and-error process. The violist Roberto Daz told me he didnt know hed love the viola before he tried it, and his tepid reaction to the violin could not have foretold the lifelong love affair he has had with the ever-so-slightly-larger viola.As I said to one young man who, on the cusp of his first real job, was paralyzed by indecision: Dont overthink it. Move in the direction of something that feels better than worse.Seek purpose.People are hard-wired not only to gratify their personal desires but also to care for others. So rather than ask, What do I want to be when I grow up? ask, In what way do I wish the world were different? What problem can I help solve? This puts the focus where it should be  on how you can serve other people.Analyzing data Ive collected on thousands of American adults, Ive found that those who have an enduring passion answer affirmatively to statements like, In choosing what to do, I always take into account whether it will benefit other people and I have a responsibility to make the world a better place.Once youve thought of what or whom you care about most, write it down. Psychologists have found that asking people to reflect in writing on their core values has miraculous effects on motivation. Because these are often the values you will be remembered for  what David Brooks calls eulogy virtues  you might consider writing a paragraph about what you would like people to say about you after youve drawn your last breath. It sounds grim, but perhaps the perspective will help you figure out what to do while you have the time to do it.Self-oriented motives like interest and other-oriented motives like altruism are not mutually exclusive. In fact, personal interest and self-transcendent purpose are the dual engines of intrinsic motivation. In combination, theyre more powerful than alone. In one study, municipal firefighters who expressed interest in their work and concern for the welfare of the public averaged more than 50 percent more overtime hours than others.Speaking for myself, psychology attracts my attention more than any other topic, but what gets me out of bed in the morning isnt just curiosity. I enjoy my work, and at the same time I believe that doing it well can contribute to the well-being of other people.Finish strong.Your first job is unlikely to be your last. Once you figure out your next step, what should you do?I confess it took a fair bit of job swapping before I knew that psychological research would become my long-term career. But in each of those jobs, I picked up knowledge and skills that I was able to weave into my current work.Also consider the commitment you made when you accepted a job. Did you pledge to stay for a year? Did you promise two weeks notice before leaving? Try to keep your word. While personal growth is important, it is imperative to act like the professional adult you are.Work as hard on your last day as on your first. No matter where you go next, you have an opportunity to make the most of where you are now."}
{"text": "PARIS  Three times, Felix Auger Aliassime was one point from claiming the boys singles title at the French Open on Sunday. But with a budding career well ahead of schedule, Auger Aliassime will have to wait just a little bit longer for a victory on the biggest stages of the sport.At 15 years 10 months, Auger Aliassime would have been the youngest boys champion at Roland Garros. But this day belonged to 17-year-old Geoffrey Blancaneaux of France, who saved three match points to win the final, 1-6, 6-3, 8-6, to the delight of the raucous French fans who poured into Court 1 just before the mens final.Auger Aliassime, who raced through the first set, 6-1, in only 24 minutes, initially took the marathon defeat hard, throwing his rackets onto the ground as the crowd chanted and sang La Marseillaise for Blancaneaux.Yannick Noah, the French Davis Cup captain and last Frenchman to have won a major singles title, when he won here in 1983, watched the match from the second row and cheered for Blancaneaux, but he leapt onto the court to comfort Auger Aliassime upon seeing his distress.The scene drew different reactions from the crowd, depending on which angle they had on Noah, who in his haste was blissfully oblivious to his beltless trousers sliding further and further down as he spoke to Auger Aliassime.Im thankful for what he did, Auger Aliassime said of Noah in an interview on TSN. Its really motivating to have such a legend talk to you afterwards.Auger Aliassime said he was quickly able to put his disappointment in perspective.I thought about it, and I know I have a lot of time in front of me, he said. But, yeah, it was tough. Its still tough to take the loss after getting so close, thats for sure.Auger Aliassime has achieved many milestones. He became the youngest player to win a match at an ATP Challenger Tour event last July when he won two rounds in Granby, Canada. He subsequently became the youngest to be ranked in the ATP top 800. (His current ranking is 619th.)At 6 feet 2 and visibly strong, Auger Aliassime said he did not feel overmatched by the adults he faced on the lower rungs of the tour.I always knew in the back of my mind that if I did the work and stayed passionate and motivated, one day it would come, he said. And it hasnt come yet, but I know Im getting closer every day that I put the work in. Since Ive got my first points last year, my first wins in the Challenger, I knew that someday I could maintain a constant level in the pro tour.He does have obstacles other professionals lack, however. Before he returns to Europe for Wimbledon, Auger Aliassime will head home to Montreal to take final exams to complete his sophomore year of high school.Thats my life, thats how it is, he said. Every time Im in Montreal I have school. Of course I dont have a normal 15-year-olds life. But with the years we kind of get used to it, and Im happy with what I do, so I dont feel like I make any sacrifices. Its my passion.Auger Aliassime lives and trains in Montreal, where he was born in 2000 to a Qubcois mother, Marie Auger, and Togolese father, Sam Aliassime. His father is a tennis coach, and Felix began to play the game when he was 4, alongside his older sister, Malika.With success coming quickly at each tier he has tried, Auger Aliassime has enticed agents and sponsors  dozens swarmed to his second-round match at the United States Open last year against the American Tommy Paul  although he has yet to turn professional.I take it as motivation, he said of the attention. These people expect a lot from me, and I expect a lot from me. Thats what keeps me hungry to win more and have more success.In the girls final, Rebeka Masarova, 16, of Switzerland defeated Amanda Anisimova, 14, of Freehold, N.J., 7-5, 7-5."}

{"text": "Dear Diary:During a late 1960s summer, I was a page at the New York Public Librarys 44th Street annex, which housed research collections and periodical archives. At the time, the library owned one of the few complete United States patent collections. My main job was fulfilling requests and reshelving materials.My most regular customer, along with the morning callers who requested copies of The Daily Racing Form before heading to Aqueduct, was an older gentleman in a blue suit who would spend the day requesting his maximum of four volumes of patents at a time. He was searching for a patent his uncle had been granted for an electronic tube that was ripped off by a big electronics maker he was suing.Then, there were more than three million patents. I wondered if, in a moment of weariness, he might have skipped over the patent.A few years later, I visited the annex for college-related reasons, and the man in the blue suit was there, perusing his usual four volumes of patents. I hope he found what he was looking for."}
{"text": "Graphic novels make summer reading stranger and more fun. Open one up, and your beach landscape (or fire escape) is replaced by an imaginary view: an artists impressions of an Australian shark museum or a grime-spattered Roman Empire, or a jungle whose talking animals stand in for Singaporean politicians of the 1950s.THE ART OF CHARLIE CHAN HOCK CHYE (Pantheon, $30) presents itself as a coffee-table victory lap. It purports to be a graphic biography of Singapores greatest comics artist, punctuated by examples of his work from 1944 (a childhood drawing of Donald Duck) to 2012 (an oil painting of Singapores prime minister Lee Kuan Yew). In fact, its something entirely different: a hugely ambitious, stylistically acrobatic work by the Singapore-based cartoonist Sonny Liew.Charlie Chan Hock Chye is Liews invention, and his fictional life story is the vehicle for both a political history of Singapores past seven decades and Liews visual homages to comics most commercially successful innovations. Early on, when we see teenage Chan Hock Chye caught up in Singapores 1954 National Service protests, the narrative is abruptly supplanted by an excerpt from a story he published around that time, Ah Huats Giant Robot  supposedly a fantasy inspired by the young artists experiences, but also a parody of Osamu Tezukas early comics (complete with yellowed newsprint textures and typeset English lettering).The parts of the book that satirize Singaporean politics often call for a bit of explanation, which Liew provides by way of endnotes and, occasionally, tiny figures chatting in the pages margins. Theres a lot of commentary on the rivalry between Lee Kuan Yew and Lim Chin Siong over the countrys direction, for instance, and a Chan Hock Chye story involving a stationery store selling O.B. markers is a joke about the out-of-bounds markers, or the invisible, shifting boundaries, that limited political discourse in the early 90s. (Its worth noting that Singapores National Arts Council originally gave Liew a grant to work on this book, and then withdrew it, citing sensitive content.)Visually, though, the book is a mercurial delight, constantly switching between Liews invented narrative (in a relatively neutral nonfiction style), images of Chan Hock Chyes works in progress over the course of his career and mock-weathered clippings from his printed creations, most of which are immaculate pastiches of famous cartoonists. A page from a 1957 story about a World War II massacre of Chinese civilians filters the look of Harvey Kurtzmans Two-Fisted Tales through Art Spiegelmans Maus; an early-60s satirical newspaper strip, Bukit Chapalang, takes its artistic and linguistic cues from Walt Kellys Pogo; a 1988 political thriller, Days of August, is a riff on Frank Millers The Dark Knight Returns.The final sections of the book are somewhat scattered; Liew seems to be driving at some point about modernity in both Singapore and comics, and doesnt quite get there, although the witty visual allusions keep flying by. The story keeps hinting at a moment of glory that never arrives, as Chan Hock Chye works his way up from humble beginnings to nearly as humble present-day circumstances  which could be Liews assessment of his medium, his country, or both.With a bit of effort, its possible to make Scripture imply almost anything you want it to, and the gifted, intensely odd Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown has performed an impressive feat of creative reinterpretation with MARY WEPT OVER THE FEET OF JESUS: Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible (Drawn & Quarterly, $21.95). Brown has been fascinated with both elements of his subject for a long time: Prostitution was the subject of his 2011 memoir, Paying for It, and his early comics included remarkable adaptations of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew. His argument here is essentially that both Jesus mother, Mary, and Mary of Bethany were prostitutes, that God favors those who disobey Him in the interest of a loving life and that the Bible has been redacted to obscure both assertions.As biblical scholarship goes, this seems fairly iffy. (Brown chides other scholars for recounting stories with fanciful elements seemingly of their own invention, even as he notes that he changed details in the parable of the prodigal son to reflect how I think Jesus told it.) As art, on the other hand, its pretty wonderful. As Browns extensive (hand-lettered) endnotes explain, the book grew out of what was initially intended to be a self-published minicomic based on a lost variation on Jesus parable of the talents, cited by the fourth-century historian Eusebius. (Browns take on that parable  that the good and faithful servant was one who spent all of his masters money on prostitutes and flute players  does indeed make for a more dramatically satisfying story than the familiar version.)The bulk of the book is Browns adaptations of Bible stories, some very familiar and others less so, all given some degree of explicitly interpretive spin. His evenhanded pace of four small panels on each page keeps the tone understated, and he gets a lot of comedic mileage out of rendering biblical dialogue into modern vernacular. (Jesus, on being told that he should be anointed, replies, I dont know  Im not into ceremonies.) But Brown zeros in on the human drama in each story  his images of David silently regarding Bathsheba make very clear the way power flows between them  and his visual craftsmanship is as sharp as its ever been. Browns drawing on the books front cover alludes to the historiated initials of illuminated manuscripts, even as it presents the Bible as a clitoris.The only section of Mary Wept thats entirely speculation on Browns part concerns Matthew working on his Gospel, wondering how to hint that Mary had been a prostitute without having that revelation censored by scribes, and deciding to invent a genealogy for Jesus that included several women who took the sexual initiative for social advantage ... I hope that, eventually, readers with eyes to see will understand. He hid his meaning well if it took close to 2,000 years for a curious artist to catch on.As a child, the British novelist Evie Wyld spent part of her time on the Australian coast, visiting her family, relaxing on the beach and having terrible fantasies about shark attacks. EVERYTHING IS TEETH (Pantheon, $24.95) is a lyrical reminiscence of her youthful fixation with sharks and with the conservationist and shark-attack survivor Rodney Fox. (The cover, following an unwelcome trend in publishing, follows Wylds name with illustrated by Joe Sumner, in smaller lettering. To read their collaboration, though, is to experience Sumners artwork at least as much as Wylds sparse, reflective narration.) Wylds fearful childhood visions are juxtaposed with her actual encounters with sharks: variously dead and beached, or small and helpless on her uncles fishing line, but never causing her as much trouble as a jellyfish that stings her.Sumners artwork here is mostly as broad and plain as a woodcut, black lines augmented with nothing but pale sand-yellow and sky blue; he draws Wyld and her family with circular heads and blunted triangles for noses. But when the sharks and other scary sea creatures turn up, he renders them in detail, and sometimes with a full spectrum of color. The water where a shark has been turns red  although the largest crimson pool we see in the book is one that ripples outward from a butchered pregnant shark.If I think the worst, Wyld notes as she plunges into one of her awful reveries, then the worst is unlikely to happen. Her sentences  often just two or three of them on each page  are clean and subdued, with an occasional poetic swerve: I get in up to my knees and the sun turns my hair to hot bread. The bloody fantasy of a shark encounter gives her young self something to cling to in the face of the ambiguous real-world violence she cant quite grasp: When her older brother comes home from being beaten up, Evie tells him stories of shark attacks to calm them both down.Famous in his native France and nearly unknown here, the cartoonist who goes by Blutch (real name: Christian Hincker) has a magnificently expressive line, so bold and ragged that it often looks as if hes snapped his brush in half and is mashing its splintered end into the drawing board. Of his two dozen or so books, his 1998 graphic novel PEPLUM (New York Review Comics, paper, $24.95) is only his second to appear in English.The peplum is a nearly extinct, peculiarly European genre: Greco-Roman adventure stories of the sort that once featured the strongman Maciste or starred Steve Reeves. But those are romantic stories about power and sweat, and this one is all gore, mud, seasickness and failure. The Roman skies Blutch draws are full of flies and carrion birds. His characters are always seen in moments of physical extremity: rage or supplication or despair. Their bodies wrestle together as if theyre half-melted rubber, or are piled high as agonized corpses. Edward Gauvins translation suggests the diction of classical drama (My chest was bathed in tears from my chagrin)  aside from a scene of Julius Caesars assassination, whose dialogue comes from Shakespeare.The story is presented in brief, brutal flashes, as if its the surviving fragments of a longer work (like Petronius Satyricon, from which Blutch draws elements of Peplums plot). Around the time Caesar falls, a group of bandits abscond with the body of a beautiful woman frozen in ice. A year later, the gangs last survivor takes the name of one of his dead associates, Publius Cimber. What follows is an escalating pyramid of horrors: plague, betrayal, the dreadful giggling of the mad. The false Publius travels with his lover, a young man who looks like the woman in the ice, and then betrays him to save the unattainable, frozen object of his passion. An actors dance becomes a slaughter; a bathing nymph turns out to be one of a cluster of handless maenads. Everything in Peplum is eroticized, and nothing can be consummated.Lucy Knisleys books are memoirs of a happy life: airy, chatty communiqus about her experiences with travel and cooking and family. SOMETHING NEW: Tales from a Makeshift Bride (First Second, $19.99) documents the year leading up to her wedding, and her attempts to make it, as she puts it, something I recognize as my own, rather than something that is happening to me.Knisley had reservations about both the institution of marriage and the cash-draining machinery of the wedding industry; she and her fianc had dated for a few years and broken up for a while before he proposed to her. Nonetheless, she found herself caught up in the vortex of wedding planning, and most of the book details various aspects of that process, from arranging the food to flushing moths out of the barn where the ceremony was to take place to reconciling the idea of getting married with her feminist ideals. Its digressive, meandering and entirely charming  her comics read like a letter one treasures.The prevailing tone of Something New is whimsy. The thin, clear lines and flat watercolor shades of Knisleys artwork make everything look cute and happy, and she takes every opportunity to poke at the excesses of bridal-marketing madness. (A double-page image of Popular Bridal Hairstyles starts out fairly straightforwardly and rapidly spirals into lunacy: Lady Dwarf Style, Bridal Croissant). This is not a particularly dramatic book  nothing really goes awry on Knisleys route to the altar, aside from some rain and a few squabbles with her mom.Thats fine: Its a story about a celebration, and Knisleys work is naturally celebratory. Nearly every panel includes a playful symbolic or metaphorical image; she happily pauses her narrative to explain how to make poutine, or to diagram the crafts projects she made for her bridesmaids, or to quote a friends funny movie summaries. And for someone who initially had so many reservations about the complicated machinery of a traditional wedding, she ends up finding the fun in nearly every aspect of it. After some angst over picking a wedding dress, she discovers one thats not only comfortable and attractive but (as she rhapsodizes for several pages) has pockets. On sale, the dress cost less than an Ikea bookshelf, she notes, with a sketch of an efficient Swedish gown box labeled GWN.Mark Beyers Amy and Jordan was one of the great underground comic strips of the late 80s and early 90s  the Candide-on-PCP misadventures of a seemingly accursed New York City couple. (Beyers crudely rendered characters are two-dimensional in a way that makes them seem to have been violently squished flat, but Amys the one with the checkerboard dress and Jordans wearing some sort of onesie with a target on his chest.) Initially published in 1987, the sour little gem AGONY (New York Review Comics, paper, $15.95) is the only book-length Amy-and-Jordan story. As Colson Whiteheads introduction to the new edition suggests, its hilarious if youre in the right mood for its gleeful parade of atrocities and deadpan expository dialogue (Well Amy, weve reattached your severed head and have also reattached Jordans legs. Youll both be well enough to go home again in a few days).The story begins with the unhappy couples being fired for gross incompetence; within the first quarter of the book, theyre attacked by a hideous ghoul creature, eaten by a giant fish, shipped off on a freighter full of sled dogs and mauled by a bear. Nonetheless, through all their humiliations and dismemberments, they try to stay optimistic. When a doctor explains that Amy has sustained permanent brain damage from being brutalized by a prison guard, Jordan is sanguine about it: Shes always been disoriented and mentally confused. It doesnt sound so bad.Beyers artwork exemplifies the warped underside of 1980s design  painstakingly hand-drawn new-wave patterns and textures are everywhere, and most of the books settings are rendered in perversely mutated perspective. For that matter, his characters blithe acceptance of the horrific abuse the world heaps on them is emblematic of the late Cold War era, when apocalypse seemed to lurk at every turn. Even the rare good things that happen to Amy and Jordan are unfair caprices of fate; the only real way to cope with powerlessness in the face of disaster, Beyer suggests, is to giggle at its absurdity."}
{"text": "PARIS  Serena Williams versus Serena Williams is supposed to be the internal conflict that decides Grand Slam tournaments in this long-running, top-heavy era in womens tennis.But on Saturday, with the French Open on the line, it looked very much like a fair fight between Serena Williams and Garbie Muguruza.A tall and elegant Spaniard who is 12 years younger than Williams, Muguruza has serious stage presence: shoulders back and chin held high. She now has the major title to match, and with her handling the moment and Williamss big-occasion aura as well as she did on Saturday in her 7-5, 6-4 victory, it is hard not to imagine her managing another such moment with similar aplomb in the near future.Weve been saying Serena always beats herself, but today maybe she didnt play her best tennis but she didnt play badly either, said Martina Navratilova, the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion. She lost to somebody who stood up to her and did not play not to lose. Garbie played to win. Its nice to see.There were many moments when the upset bid could have unraveled; many occasions when she needed to display strength and resolve to keep Williams from shifting the momentum.There was the fourth game of the match, when Muguruza fought off a break point with an ace. And the final game of the first set, when she rallied from 15-40 with more clutch serving.There was her response after she made three of her nine double faults in a single game to lose her serve and a 1-0 lead in the second set. The response was a flurry of big-bang tennis that allowed her to break Williams straight back.Above all, there was the way Muguruza responded after failing to convert on four championship points on Williamss serve at 5-3 in the second set.Many a Williams opponent would have taken the hint and the runner-up plate. Muguruza served out the match at love, pushing forward and attempting to resolve the conflict instead of hoping it might resolve itself.She didnt shrink from the pressure; she embraced it, said Navratilova, a great champion who needed time to learn how to manage her own nerves on the biggest occasions. It would have been so easy to just bag it after she had those four match points.The memory of upsetting Williams, 6-2, 6-2, in the second round of the French Open in 2014 almost certainly helped. The experience of facing Williams in last years Wimbledon final most likely did, as well.Wimbledon was Muguruzas major final debut, and Williams won in straight sets to claim her 21st Grand Slam singles title and complete her second Serena Slam by winning a fourth consecutive major.But nearly one year later, Williams is still chasing No. 22, while three women have now won their first Grand Slam titles: Flavia Pennetta at last years United States Open, Angelique Kerber at this years Australian Open and now Muguruza.I think its great that there are new faces and that players now know that it is possible to win, to defeat Serena, Muguruza said. I think its a breath of fresh air.It looked like a downbeat year for Spain when Rafael Nadal, the nine-time mens champion, had to withdraw after two rounds with an injury to his left wrist. Instead, Spain got to celebrate twice on the final weekend as Muguruza and then the Spanish mens doubles team of Feliciano Lpez and Marc Lpez won titles on Philippe Chatrier Court on the same afternoon.Nadal sent a congratulatory message to Muguruza, who said one of the first thoughts she had afterward was to wonder how on earth Nadal managed to win nine French Opens.For now, she seems delighted with one, which makes her the first Spanish woman to win the singles title since Arantxa Snchez Vicario won the last of her three French Opens in 1998. Snchez was in the front row of the presidents box on Saturday.I opened the way for Spanish woman to win here, said Snchez. But Im delighted that Garbie has reopened it now. She has a great future in front of her.It was a victory for Spain but also for Venezuela. Muguruza is a dual citizen who was born in Caracas to a Venezuelan mother and a Spanish father. She feels her dual identity very strongly and chose to officially represent Spain in 2014 only because the Fed Cup and the Olympics made a choice necessary.But her roots in Spanish tennis run deep. After moving to Spain at an early age, she trained near Barcelona at the Bruguera Tennis Academy, which was founded by Llus Bruguera, a remarkable coach and the father of the two-time French Open mens champion Sergi Bruguera.Muguruzas flat-hitting, go-for-broke game bears little resemblance to the more patient, topspin-heavy approach of Sergi Bruguera or Snchezs domestic rival Conchita Martnez. But Muguruza has the power and the charisma to start a new Spanish school, and though she is hardly a steady flame at this stage (this was her first final of the year), she would appear to possess the sort of internal drive that serial Grand Slam champions like Williams require.This after all is the young woman who, when she missed half the 2013 season because of foot surgery, chose to bring a chair out to the practice court and continue hitting balls from a seated position."}
{"text": "The minute I got on that bus, I knew I was in trouble. The driver sat at the stop just long enough to miss the green light. Then he inched along till he missed the next light and the one after that. He stopped at every stop even though not a soul was waiting.The 20-minute trip to work stretched to a half-hour, then longer. I was late, late, late.But this was a driver with a mission, clearly way ahead of schedule and trying to get back on track. He was very early; now I was very late. We were two people with competing, mutually exclusive agendas, and the one in the drivers seat was bound to win.A half-hour later, still sweating from racing the last five blocks on foot, with patients piling up in the waiting room, I became the one in the drivers seat, with the mission and overriding agenda. Woe betide those with competing plans.Just like that driver, I work under two mandates. One is professional: getting my passengers from point A to point B without breaking the law or killing anyone. The other one is less exalted but generally far more visible: I run according to a schedule that I ignore at my peril.Shes running late, they mutter out in the waiting room. And indeed, she runs late for exactly the same reasons your bus runs late: too many slow-moving passengers lined up to board. Not enough buses or drivers. A person in a wheelchair requiring extra attention. Horrible traffic.Not only does she often run late, but your poor driver  er, doctor  can run only so late before disaster ensues. She has obligations not only to you and your fellow passengers twitching in annoyance, but to a host of others, including the nursing and secretarial staffs and the cleaning crew at the end of the line. She cant pull that bus in at midnight if everyone is supposed to leave by 7 p.m.So when there is enough work to last till midnight, my agenda shifts, and not so subtly. Everyone can tell when I begin to speed. Every visit is pared down to the essentials. All optional and cosmetic issues are postponed, including most toenail problems and all paperwork. Chatting is minimized.As a bus driver once said to me when I was foolish enough to start a conversation about his speed: Lady, just get behind the white line and let me drive.Medicine is full of competing agendas. Even at the best of times, the match between the doctors and the patients is less than perfect, sometimes egregiously so. Some residents are now trained specifically in agenda setting, the art of successfully amalgamating all concerns.But when its all about speed, an advanced skill set is required.A patient has been waiting weeks for his appointment, anxiously rehearsing his lines. Bad luck that he showed up on a day I need him in and out in 19 minutes. He spends his first 18 unwisely, pretending everything is fine, making small talk, not quite mustering the courage to say whats on his mind.Then just as he is being ushered gently to the door, he pauses. Oh, by the way Oh, by the way is an infamous schedule buster. It means something bad: a suspicious lump, a sexually transmitted disease. Further, it is so common that an entire literature now addresses the oh, by the way phenomenon and how to tame it.One favored tool is: What else? That question, asked by the doctor early in the visit, is intended to probe the patients agenda before it trumps the doctors.As one set of researchers wrote: The what else? technique uncovers pertinent fears and anxieties up front and prevents an oh, by the way, I have been having some chest pain from surfacing at the end of a visit.In other words: My agenda is to adopt your agenda, and then rework it so that I can drive on. Brutal, perhaps, but effective.Very rarely do things work out for me the way they did for that driver who made me so late to work. Occasionally I have so much time that I can dawdle along the route.I remember clearly the last time that happened. Hows work? I began. What are you doing for exercise? Any hobbies? Your family, are they well? I progressed rapidly through seatbelts, bike helmets, family medical history, end-of-life preferences  every single stop my bus typically has no time to make.Every answer was fine, yes, or I dunno. Then the patient stood up: Look, I have places to be. Are we done?We were two people with competing, mutually exclusive agendas. But that time the one in the drivers seat lost.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}

Bradford Hipps (Sunday Review, May 22):I wish to add to Mr. Hippss argument that in addition to reading novels, one should also learn to think critically and write well if one wants to write good software.What we developers deem spaghetti code is bad, convoluted code that usually does not work correctly and is a nightmare to debug. Anyone can write bad code. Good code, however, must be preceded by hard-thinking and lots of revisions until it is as clear as possible.It must be easy to understand and concise, because it will probably be changed by another programmer.A humanities education should not be denigrated if it teaches critical thinking. I was a business major, but I took a lot of classes in the classics and history, where I learned to construct solid arguments and write as well as I could.I have found this training to be indispensable in all parts of my life.JENNIFER LEESouth San Francisco"}
{"text": "To the Editor:President Obamas visit to Hiroshima should also reawaken us to the peril of nuclear weapons. (Obama: Abes enabler, Opinion, June 1)Whats really striking is that Japan has taken a leadership role in encouraging nations to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which bans all nuclear test explosions. However, the United States is among the eight nations that are preventing this treaty from taking effect. China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran and Israel are the other seven nations that have yet to approve the treaty.The Republican-led Senate has the power to ratify the test ban treaty. It can finish a journey started by one of their own, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who believed that ending testing was a step toward global disarmament. Ike did not want Americans to have carry the expensive burden of nukes forever.But with President Obama ordering a massive nuclear spending spree, we need some basis of hope to get out of this expensive and dangerous business. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty gives us an opening that we should take.WILLIAM LAMBERSCincinnatiThe writer is the author of Nuclear Weapons and the Road to Peace."}
{"text": "On a recent stormy Monday in Milan, Lorenzo Serafini, the designer of Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini, set off on foot to spend an afternoon at his favorite local haunts. The crush of work designing the spring/summer 2017 collection was only beginning, and Serafini  tan and unshaven after a week of scuba diving in the Maldives  was still relaxed.Taking some free time with T, he roamed the citys historic nooks, stopping to browse antique collectibles and a trove of designer vintage clothes. He began close to his home east of the Duomo, where Serafini wandered under a pointed archway into a vine-covered alley amid the neo-Gothic buildings of the Verdi Conservatory. The street resonated with the sound of musicians at practice. Milan has these secret paradises that let you feel outside of time, he said.After 20 years in womens wear, Serafini, 43, inhabits a position of enviable autonomy in fashion. Picked by Alberta Ferretti to be the creative director of the secondary line she created in 1984, Serafini has been given freedom to express his romantic vision as the head of the brand. (The offshoot label retained Ferrettis own name for 30 years until, after an 18-month stint with designer Natalie Ratabesi, Ferretti rechristened it in honor of her new designer: Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini.)Strolling towards the headquarters of Alberta Ferretti and Philosophy, Serafini opened a plaid umbrella against the rain, pausing to take in Via Bellinis Art Nouveau masterpieces. Soon, he reached his own studio in Palazzo Donizetti, a florid, Liberty-style building designed by Piero Portaluppi in 1920. On the villas elegant second floor, his office is papered, preteen style, with his icons: Brooke Shields, Jane Birkin, Siouxsie Sioux  the women of my youth, he said wistfully. On his desk, the upcoming spring collection was beginning to take shape: Inspired by the freedom you feel on vacation, the naturalness you have by the sea, he said, gazing at a photo of Brooke Shields. Wild, like Blue LagoonNostalgia runs deep in Serafinis approach to fashion. He looks back reverently on his working experiences  four years as head of womens wear at Dolce and Gabbana, 10 at Roberto Cavalli and five at Blumarine  as the best education possible. His youth in the seaside town of Riccione, where his father ran a hotel for beachgoers, left its mark  he still keeps the magazines that first piqued his love for fashion, which continue to inspire him. Im not interested in inventing anything, he said. The past already offers us the keys to feminine style that work for every woman  romanticism, lightweights, fluid volumes, prints, ruching  that I interpret with new silhouettes and new fabrics.After a lunch of his customary order of spaghetti alle vongole at the iconic Milan restaurant Da Giacomo, a taxi deposited Serafini at LOro dei Farlocchi, a gallery of antique curiosities in the Brera neighborhood. A larger-than-life handmade ostrich stood by the entrance, surrounded by collectibles of every sort: a narwhal tusk in a bronze base, gilt-framed 18th-century illustrations, a hand-carved cabbage like one Serafini had bought for a friend. He crossed himself with holy water in the neighboring church before continuing on to Franco Jacassi, a nearby three-story emporium filled with racks of vintage clothing by designers like Yves Saint Laurent, Pucci and Issey Miyake.Vintage pieces were made with more love, he said conspiratorially, as he admired a pair of chiffon Versace harem pants from the 70s. There was less mass market and more attention to detail then, and time gives the clothes a very singular patina. In his own designs, he seeks to create a timeworn feeling with washes and treatments, mislaid creases and raw edges. I want a woman to wear my dress as if shes already had it for a very long time, he said. He pointed to his own vintage sweater and twenty-year-old Levis. An object is more than just an object  its a vehicle of emotions. Its that sentimentality, that love for clothes, that I try to express with my designs.Thunder rumbled as Serafini walked on towards the Palazzo Brera, a former abbey thats home to an art school and the Pinacoteca di Brera museum, where Philosophy held its spring show, his second for the house. The beginning was a bit scary  directing a label from A to Z, and being in the spotlight, he said softly, referring to his initial collection presentation. Im a bit shy and reserved, and it was a shock to see my name on the brand.He headed into the botanical garden behind the building, where monks once planted medicinal herbs. I never think about the future, but my vision for Philosophy has always been clear, he said, pacing the dense rows of greenery. My mission is to create a complete wardrobe for a woman today. The classic, romantic codes of femininity are my tools. I just revisit them with a touch of modernity  more comfort, and more uses for a dress. The rain had stopped, and the 17th-century garden filled the stillness of the moist air with the scent of roses, juniper and rosemary. Everything exists already, he said. The only things I can create are new emotions."}
{"text": "BEIJING  The Obama administration plans to use annual talks with leaders in Beijing to push for cuts in excess Chinese industrial output, which has inundated foreign markets with discounted steel, aluminum and other products, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in Beijing on Sunday ahead of the meeting.The talks, known as the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, bring together senior American and Chinese officials every year to discuss a broad range of economic, foreign policy and security concerns. On the economic side of the talks, Chinas exchange rate controls and intellectual property violations will be high on the American agenda, while North Korea and the South China Sea are expected to dominate the security talks.But Mr. Lew said the economic track of the meeting in the Chinese capital this year would also take up Chinas flood of exports of steel and other products, which have spilled into the international marketplace, provoking anger from producers, unions and politicians.Excess capacity is not just a domestic issue, Mr. Lew told an audience of students and academics at Tsinghua University ahead of the start of the dialogue on Monday.The question of excess capacity is one that really has an enormous effect on global markets for things like steel and aluminum, he said. Were seeing distortions in global markets because of excess capacity.A senior Chinese official said last week that his side was prepared to discuss excess capacity but was vague about how China would respond.We do not shy away from problems, the official, Zhu Guangyao, a vice minister of finance, told reporters at a briefing. Anything can be discussed in the economic dialogue.Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have said they will cut back production at steel mills, coal mines and other plants, where capacity far exceeds domestic demand, especially as the economy slows and shifts away from smokestack industries. Mr. Xi has made that part of a program of shifting investment to more rewarding areas that he calls supply-side structural reform.We cannot wait just because the burden is heavy, or fail to act just because there are many hardships, Mr. Xi said at a meeting of policy makers in May in which the program for cutting excess capacity was discussed, according to an official summary.But the Chinese governments plans remain opaque, and, meanwhile, much of that excess output is being sold on foreign markets where other manufacturers are struggling to compete with Chinas much cheaper production.The cut-price exports of solar panels, aluminum and other goods have become especially contentious during the American presidential race. Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders have both argued strongly that trade agreements have been unfairly tilted against American workers.In March, the United States put a tariff of 266 percent on some Chinese steel makers for selling below cost. And last month, in separate actions, the Commerce Department announced duties of 450 percent and 522 percent on some imports of Chinese steel.Mr. Lew appeared to wager that he could help win more action from Beijing by putting excess capacity high on the agenda before the Group of 20 summit meeting of leaders of the major economies, which China will hold in the eastern city of Hangzhou in September. China is also trying to win official status as a market economy from the United States and European Union, which would make it easier for its manufacturers to ward off punitive tariffs on exports.Referring to the excess capacity, Mr. Lew said on Sunday, Chinas capacity to address that is central to Chinas economy, to the global economy and to the U.S.-China relationship.He went on, I believe that it is deeply in Chinas interest to follow through on the policies that have been outlined in previous Chinese leadership meetings. Excess capacity ultimately is corrosive of an economys economic efficiency. It means that you have a misallocation of resources.Mr. Lew said the Obama administration was watching to see whether changes introduced by the Chinese authorities in August amounted to a real, lasting step toward loosening controls on the renminbi exchange rate. China devalued the currency by almost 2 percent, and the central bank, the Peoples Bank of China, said at the time that market forces would play a bigger role in setting the value of the currency.In recent months, he noted, China has sometimes acted to strengthen the value of the renminbi, making imports into China more attractive, rather than weakening the currency. More recently, the yuan has weakened against the dollar to levels not seen in five years.The strategic dialogue began nearly 10 years ago in George W. Bushs administration as an effort for the United States and China to set an agenda for the most important issues and find a path to solving them. In 2009, it grew from an economic focus to include security issues. The meeting has evolved into a set of talks involving hundreds of officials meeting over several days to discuss issues as diverse as civilian aviation and the protection of elephants, as well as the big economic and security matters.But with Mr. Xi concentrating more power in his own hands, the usefulness of such a wide-ranging exercise may have outrun itself, some Americans said. Mr. Xi opened the dialogue with a speech, and his closest economic adviser, Liu He, met with Mr. Lew on Sunday.With the Obama administration in its final lap and a leadership transition looming in China next year, it is unlikely that this years dialogue will result in any breakthroughs, said Eswar S. Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.While the dialogue will include many top-level Chinese technocrats, there is a widespread perception that their influence on economic policies and reforms has been circumscribed by the rising concentration of power in the hands of President Xi and a close circle of his aides, he said.The new American president  whether Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton  would be unlikely to continue the annual talks in such a broad manner, Professor Prasad said. Top officials on both sides probably view the dialogue this year as their last waltz together, he said."}
{"text": "MINNEAPOLIS  The day after his oldest son was convicted of conspiring to join and kill for the Islamic State in Syria, Abdihamid Yusuf just wanted to go home and rest. But bills were stacking up, so on Saturday morning he and his wife visited the jail and then reopened Hooyos Kitchen, the small Somali restaurant where they serve plates of chicken, rice and bananas.We try to survive, Mr. Yusuf said.The trial of his son and two other young Somali-American men splintered families and opinions here in the countrys largest Somali community. Former friends testified against one another, describing how they had watched propaganda videos, bought fake passports and plotted their paths to Syria. Family members squabbled in the halls of the courthouse. Some said they had been threatened or shunned.When the jury came back on Friday afternoon, Mr. Yusuf did not even get word in time to reach the courtroom to see his 22-year-old son, Mohamed Farah, and the two other defendants, Guled Omar, 21, and Abdirahman Daud, 22, declared guilty. A total of nine men  including another of Mr. Yusufs sons, Adnan  have been convicted in the case.Federal prosecutors say the case shined a light on the persistent problem of terrorist recruiting here. Law enforcement authorities have said that more than 20 young men from Minnesota have left to join the Shabab militant group in Somalia and that more than 15 have tried or succeeded in leaving to join the Islamic State.But it also opened wounds among families, and at the end of the trial, some in the community praised justice served, while others pointed to what they called another injustice.Deqa Hussen said she had learned the price of cooperating: Theyve been calling me snitch.Her oldest son, Abdirizak Warsame, 21, briefly acted as the leader of a group of friends as they planned to travel to Syria in 2014. He pleaded guilty and testified for prosecutors, telling the jury how he had wanted the rewards of martyrdom.Now, Ms. Hussen said, longtime friends and strangers have accused her of selling her son to the government. During the trial, she said, the mother of another defendant threatened her life.I have to respect the government and I have to respect my son, she said. My culture is a culture of silence. You cannot speak your rights.Some in the Somali community praised the government. They said that the three defendants had gotten a fair trial, and that they hoped the convictions would prompt candid talks about extremism and its allure to some young men here.This is good for the community, said Mohamed Ahmed, a gas station manager who created an online cartoon character, Average Mohamed, to condemn extremism. It unmasks the fear, forces us to think deeply. We can either confront it or bury our heads.Jibril Afyare, an IBM software engineer and community activist, spoke of vigilance. He said he talked regularly to the United States attorney about the threat of recruitment by terrorist groups, and has a local police captains number on speed dial.We cannot afford even one Somali youth to be recruited by extremists, he said. Its dangerous for the country, and its dangerous for the Somali community.But others called the case a setup, and said the defendants had been goaded to act and praise terrorism by a onetime friend who made secret audio recordings as a paid federal informant. In barber shops and cafes where the case flashed on television screens, young men and old said the trial would harden the communitys relationship with law enforcement, and said the defendants did not deserve potential sentences of life in prison.People think the trial was dishonest and was done in a hurry, that this is a conspiracy, said Jamaal K. Farah, 35, a barber and comedian who goes by the name Happy Khalif and has attracted hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube.Mr. Farah said he used to give haircuts to some of the nine friends who have now pleaded guilty or been convicted. He rejected portrayals of them as eager, would-be militants who spoke of wanting to spit on the United States, kill Turkish security forces or die as martyrs.The case focused on conversations and events in 2014 and 2015. Prosecutors said some of the defendants had watched Islamic State propaganda videos, met to discuss routes and timing to leave for Syria, tried to buy fake passports from an undercover F.B.I. agent and played paintball to train for combat.But to Mr. Farah and others skeptical of the convictions, the men were not defendants or terrorists, but boys, brothers, kids who had messed up but deserved a second chance.These kids used to be part of this community, Mr. Farah said. This country gave us hope and a better life. We think this trial was a total injustice.As he watched boys play basketball outside a community center in central Minneapolis, Burhan Mohumed thought of his friend Guled Omar.He said Mr. Omar had played here before he was caught up in that storm. Mr. Mohumed attended the trial regularly but was barred from the courthouse after he intervened in a fight and argued with court security officers.After the trial, Andrew M. Luger, the United States attorney for Minnesota, condemned the threats and courthouse scuffles as intolerable and unheard-of.Mr. Mohumed supported the three defendants and, echoing others here, he was upset they could face life in prison even though they never left for Syria and never pulled a trigger.If they can convict them on words and thoughts, its over, he said. People will not feel safe in our communities.But prosecutors said the case involved far more than thoughts. They said the defendants were ready to kill for the Islamic State and had made well-documented efforts to fly out of Kennedy International Airport or cross the Mexican border to travel to Syria.On Saturday, Mr. Yusuf said, his wife insisted that they go back to work after they visited their son in jail. He said he had taken time off from his job driving a school bus to deal with the criminal cases against his sons. But they still had five other children to care for.So they opened Hooyos Kitchen, in a Somali shopping center stuffed with rug stores, barber shops, classrooms and kitchens, four floors above Mr. Farahs barber shop.As his wife cooked, Mr. Yusuf rushed food to customers. People stopped by to tell them to be strong. Mr. Yusufs thoughts tilted back to his sons.He said Mohamed Farah, the oldest, was hopeful about sentencing, and had told him that whatever came next was Gods will. He worried about the cost of funding two commissary accounts so his sons could call him from jail. He worried about the distance he would have to drive to visit them.Its not fair, Mr. Yusuf said. But he said they were propped up by faith. We believe God will give, no matter what."}

{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.)Good evening. Heres the latest.1. On the eve of the New Jersey and California primaries, a survey by The Associated Press found that Hillary Clinton had enough delegates to clinch the nomination. The campaign manager for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in a statement that The A.P.s ruling was unfortunate and a rush to judgment. Mr. Sanders had hoped that a victory in California might persuade party leaders to back him. President Obama has yet to endorse either candidate, but his aides have said that he is eager to campaign on behalf of Mrs. Clinton and is particularly enthusiastic about taking on Donald J. Trump._____2. As Iraqi forces and their Shiite militia allies try to wrest the city of Falluja from the grip of the Islamic State militants, thousands of civilians have fled, braving the perils of nighttime journeys and the militants gunfire to make it out. But at least 50,000 more are trapped inside, and as many as 20,000 may be children. Aid workers worry that many will be threatened by starvation if the siege wears on._____3. After a lackluster jobs report in May, the Federal Reserve may be rethinking its plan to raise interest rates. Janet L. Yellen, the Feds chairwoman, gave a speech on Monday in which she did not repeat her past remarks about a rate increase in the coming months. She insisted though, that one bad report would not cause the Fed to chart an entirely new course: The bank could still decide to raise rates in the summer or the fall._____4. A sexual assault case that had already made its way through court drew fresh attention after the victims entire statement to her attacker in court was published. The defendant, a former student at Stanford University, was sentenced to six months in jail after being convicted of three counts of sexual assault, a punishment that many critics said was far too lenient. An effort has been mounted to recall the judge who handed out the sentence._____5. The Cavaliers have lost the first two games of the N.B.A. Finals by a combined margin of 48 points. In other words, theyre getting crushed by the Golden State Warriors, who are intent on capturing their second consecutive championship. Our analyst places much of the blame on the shoulders of the Cavs superstar, LeBron James. After all, he writes, this was the team the King himself courted._____6. The Ohio woman whose son wandered into a gorilla exhibit, leading to the fatal shooting of a silverback named Harambe, will not face charges, a state prosecutor announced Monday. She was being attentive to her children by all witness accounts, the prosecutor said. And the 3-year-old just scampered off. The episode has raised questions about whether gorillas really belong in zoos._____7. American sailors stationed in Japan were prohibited from drinking after an officer was arrested in connection with a car accident that left two Japanese civilians injured. Resentment against the U.S. military on Okinawa has been rising, and the arrest of the sailor, who was thought to be drunk, caused a public outcry._____8. If Mark Zuckerberg is vulnerable to hacking, then who among us is safe? That was the question after news broke that the Facebook billionaire was the victim of a hacking collective, which broke into several of his social media accounts. The simplest way to avoid a similar fate? Use different passwords for different websites, and change them frequently._____9. New Yorkers often think of Pennsylvania Station as a grim purgatory, one best avoided if possible. Yet some of the most beautiful music ever written  Mozart, Beethoven  is piped into the station. The D.J.s are not fellow travelers, but three Texan women who attempt to anticipate the music that will best soothe stressed-out Gothamites._____10. Rain kept Kanye West from performing at the Governors Ball music festival on Sunday. So the rapper displayed the extent of his powers: He signaled that he would play a concert at 2 in the morning at another venue in the East Village. A crowd materialized out of thin air, but the concert was not to be. The closest Mr. West came to performing was to emerge briefly from the sunroof of a car he was riding in._____11. Most of us would never imagine wanting to track the brain signals of amorous flies, or that the task might present a tricky problem. A paper released last month details the way a team of California scientists worked their way through that experiment using cameras, lasers and insect-brain surgery, in which the tops of the creatures heads were replaced by tiny glass windows._____12. Muhammad Ali broke all the rules of boxing. So what made him a champion? Fast feet. A pesky jab. An iron jaw. A lean frame. And a cunning, calculating, lightning-quick mind. That final attribute also contributed to his singular status as a politically outspoken, unapologetically black athlete who never sold out, our columnist writes._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And dont miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to look back?

{"text": "The candidacy of Donald Trump, the fervor of those who support it, and the fierce opposition of those who dont is making America mad  both angry and insane, as the dual definitions of the word implies.One of the most disturbing displays of this madness is the violence that Trump has incited in his supporters, and the violent ways in which opposition forces have responded, like the exchange we saw last week in San Jose.Both forms of violence are unequivocally wrong, but speak to a base level of hostility that hovers around the man like the stench from rotting flesh.What is particularly disturbing is to see anti-Trump forces lashing out at Trumps supporters, seemingly provoked simply by a difference in political position.This cannot be. Its self-defeating and narrows the space between the thing you despise and the thing you become.Listen, I understand how unsettling this man is for many.I understand that he is elevating and normalizing a particular stance of racism and sexism that many view as a spiritual attack, a kind of psychic violence from which they cannot escape.Furthermore, the election cycle promises at least five more months of this, until Election Day, and even more if by some tragic twist of fate Trump is actually elected.And, if elected, the threat could move from the rhetoric to the real, wreaking havoc on millions of lives.I understand the frightful, mind-numbing, hair-raising disbelief that can descend when one realizes that this is indeed plausible.Recent polls have only added to this anxiety as some have shown an increasingly tight race between him and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee; some even have him beating her.(Now of course, these polls must be taken with a grain of salt. Trump and Clinton are in different phases of the fight: Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee with no remaining opponents and with Republicans coalescing around his candidacy; Clinton is still in a heated contest with Bernie Sanders, who has given no indication of giving up.)I understand that Trump represents a clear and present danger, and having a passionate response that encompasses rage and fear is reasonable.It is understandable to want to make ones displeasure known.But there is a line one dares not cross, and that is the one of responding to violent rhetoric with violent actions.As I have said before, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best in his 1967 book Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?, and he is worthy of quoting here at length:The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So it goes. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.You may feel activated by the cause of righteousness, but violence is most often a poor instrument for its implementation. Indeed, violence corrodes righteousness. It robs it of its essence.The best way to direct passions is not only with the bullhorn, but also at the ballot box.In a democracy, the vote is the voice. The best way to reduce the threat Trump poses is to register and motivate people who share your view of the threat.It is easy to look at the throngs who support and exalt this man and be discouraged, but dont be. It is easy to look at Republicans like Paul Ryan abandoning their principles and selling their souls to fall in line behind this man and be discouraged, but dont be. It is easy to see the media fail miserably to counter Trump and his surrogates Gish-gallop and be discouraged, but dont be.These are the moments in which the nations mettle  and ideals  are tested. I have a fundamental belief that although America was born and grew by violence and racial subjugation, that although it has often stumbled and even regressed, that its ultimate bearing is toward the better.Folks must be reminded that one demagogue cannot lead to a detour or a dismantling. There is an elevated plane of truth that floats a mile above Trumps trough of putrescence.Trump and his millions of minions have replaced what they call political correctness with ambient viciousness.This wont make America great again, because the again they imagine harkens back to Americas darkness. We are the new America  more diverse, more inclusive, more than our ancestors could ever have imagined.Dont invalidate that by allowing yourselves to be baited into brutishness."}
{"text": "When it comes to behaving badly, the New York State Legislature has been thinking outside the box. There are, it turns out, ways to do the wrong thing that go beyond the usual influence-peddling, bribing, extorting and other common varieties of Albany venality.There is, for example, undoing good work done elsewhere. That is the aim of a noxious bill that has gained momentum in the waning days of the Albany session. It would squelch New York Citys recently adopted 5-cent fee on disposable plastic shopping bags.The City Council, after years of deliberation and through a finely wrought compromise, passed the fee as an antipollution measure. It seeks to sharply reduce the use of the bags, whose ubiquity and near-indestructibility have made them one of the citys signature eyesores and a serious environmental threat.The state legislation, sponsored in the Senate by Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat, and in the Assembly by Michael Cusick, a Staten Island Democrat, would forbid any city to impose fees or taxes to discourage the use of plastic bags. The measure would, in a stroke, force the city to accept the perpetuation of the plastic-trash free-for-all, with tons of discarded bags clogging the sewers, festooning tree branches and littering sidewalks.Why would Albany do this? Because Albany can. Because New York City has no power compared with the muscle Albany can flex. Because the will of a sovereign city counts for little when there are populist points to be scored, and plastic-bag-maker lobbyists to please.The bag fee is not, in the scheme of things, earth-shattering. Its a nickel. It is not a tax  the city doesnt collect or spend any of the revenue  its just a calculated inconvenience to give consumers an incentive to shop with reusable bags. The fee is potentially annoying, but it spares the poor and businesses that would suffer unduly, for benefits that would be enjoyed across the populace. Cities that have tried fees have found that they work splendidly.But for meddlesome reasons, some Albany pols want to overrule the City Council, citing dubious principle. Youre irritating people to change their behavior  thats not what were here for, Mr. Felder said recently.Some would argue that its the state legislators who do the irritating, which is easy enough under a system of government that forces the city and its mayor to go begging to Albany for money and permission to do basic things like run the schools, regulate traffic and, in this case, somehow shrink a mountain of plastic trash. Getting a handle on disposable bags was a simple, smart decision that the City Council should have been able to make for itself. If the Legislature persists in passing this meddling bill, then Gov. Andrew Cuomo will have to be the grown-up who sets this particular wrong right."}
{"text": "OAKLAND, Calif.  Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, is fairly open about the fact that he plays favorites. When it comes to shooting the basketball, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are allowed to do whatever they want. They can chuck shots from the bleachers. Bad shots do not exist for them.Thats the rule, Kerr said, adding, I trust their judgment.Draymond Green has not earned the right to be included in their elite little group  not yet, anyway. But he was at his dynamic best in the Warriors 110-77 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night in Game 2 of the N.B.A. finals. He buried 3-pointers. He defended. He rebounded. And he helped carry the Warriors to a two-games-to-none series lead at Oracle Arena.I dont come into the game saying, Oh, I have to shoot a lot more,  said Green, who finished with 28 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists. Like, thats not me. Thats not what I do for this team. But at the end of the day, if the game says shoot, youre supposed to shoot. Because usually when you dont, it turns into a disaster.The Cavaliers are in a world of trouble ahead of Game 3, which is scheduled for Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. The Warriors can sniff a second straight championship, can sense the final act in their history-making season. After setting an N.B.A. record by winning 73 games in the regular season, they need two more for another title.Everything changes when we go to Cleveland, Kerr said. We know that. We have unbelievable respect for this team, and weve got to go on the road and try to do it again.Curry scored 18 points, and Thompson added 17  two more relatively muted efforts for them as defenders collapsed on them. But they found Green with so much open space on the perimeter, he could have been lounging on a beach towel and sipping a cool drink.Tonight, Thompson said, he was one of us.Green relished his opportunities. He shot 11 of 20 from the field and 5 of 8 from 3-point range. Kerr was miffed about only one of Greens attempts, when he pulled up in transition and did a little dance before he let the ball fly. It was not what Kerr considered a high-percentage shot. Green made it anyway.He becomes our safety valve when theres pressure, Kerr said. He becomes an open shooter when theyre stepping out on Steph or Klay. So its a good situation for him.LeBron James collected 19 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds, but he said he was disappointed with his performance, citing his 7 turnovers. The Cavaliers committed 18 as a team, which led to 26 points for the Warriors.Its hard for me to kind of pinpoint whats not working and what could work right now, James said. Obviously, not much work is working, especially offensively.But James did not benefit from much help. Kyrie Irving had 10 points, and Kevin Love scored 5 points before he departed for the locker room early in the second half with dizziness. He was placed in the leagues concussion protocol.The Cavaliers shot 35.4 percent over all. It looked as if they were hoisting shots in a stiff wind.They were tougher than us and more aggressive, Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue said.While the Warriors are celebrated for their long-distance shooting, they also broke out their lunch pails and hard hats. When Love caught an inadvertent elbow to the back of the head midway through the second quarter, Green went straight at the rim for a layup. He punctuated the play by flexing his biceps as Love writhed in pain nearby.The victory was not without its challenges for Golden State. Curry picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter and took a seat on the bench. But when the Cavaliers threatened, Green answered with another 3-pointer, his fourth of the game. Curry returned at the start of the fourth quarter. He promptly swished a 3-pointer from another ZIP code. The lead was 23.Curry and Thompson had both struggled Thursday in Game 1, when they combined to score just 20 points on 8-of-27 shooting. Propped up by their bench, the Warriors won by 15  a result that portended danger for the Cavaliers. If they could not capitalize when Curry and Thompson were not playing good basketball, what did they expect to do once those two players started making shots? And rest assured, they would start making shots. Their problems would not persist forever.Ahead of Game 2, the Cavaliers said they wanted to operate with more pace, a familiar refrain for them this season. But playing fast is a dicey proposition against Golden State, which employs players with advanced degrees in transition basketball.The Warriors actually stumbled through a sluggish start, a Lamborghini stuck in second gear. After James went baseline for a spinning layup that put Cleveland ahead by 4 early in the second quarter, Kerr had seen enough. He called a 20-second timeout so he could share some words of wisdom with his players.They promptly hit the gas. Green sank a 3-pointer. Curry buried a pull-up jumper. And the Warriors continued to apply pressure, building a 15-point lead late in the second quarter.Golden States lead grew and grew over the course of the second half, each possession feeling more like a celebration for the fans at Oracle.Outside the visiting locker room, a mountain of luggage was waiting for the Cavaliers by the start of the fourth quarter. They could not leave town fast enough."}
{"text": "When I was 15 years old some kid at my school asked me what I felt about the draft and Vietnam. He wanted to know if I expected to go to war and if I was happy about that possibility. I told him that I had no intention of fighting the Vietnamese, first, and most importantly, because I have no desire to be killed or maimed and secondly, because I feel no hatred toward or fear of the Vietnamese people. These are the words I used and even at the time I wondered where they had come from.The answer was, of course, Muhammad Ali. His courageous and articulate stance against the imperialism of that war had seeped into my awareness without my knowledge; thats how powerful he was. I mean, he was fast and strong in the ring, but Alis rope-a-dope or phantom punches were nothing compared with his character, his commitment to a code of conduct, and his unique ability to motivate the entire world.I remember the day I became aware of the Champ. My mother was driving me to school after he won the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston. At a crosswalk a black man passing in front of our car suddenly turned and, raising his fists into the air, announced loudly, I am the greatest! I was frightened by the mans violent outburst, but even then I heard the pride and hurt, the dashed ambition and the shard of hope that cut through him. Cassius Clays declaration had become his own. The Black Pride movement was on, and one of its pillars were these four words.Ali brought white college students together with black militants in their fights against war, racism and class oppression. His words were powerful, but I feel that it was his presence and willingness to engage that opened the doors between the races. Not everyone loved him. If you choose a side and commit to change, if youre brash and outspoken and brave there are bound to be detractors. If you put human life above nationalism, or one God over another, there will be haters. But even here, over the decades, Ali changed many hearts and minds.And he did this without the trappings of many social and political leaders. We always felt that he was one of us and with us because he was a working man. He was our John Henry. He was sweat and bone, blood and pain. Thats the language of the worker. And like most people, who build the world with their sweat and strain, he had his best years taken from him.He took on some of the baddest fighters that ever got into the ring. Many of his opponents were stronger than him; some matched him in heart; there were others who went toe to toe from the first round to the last, taking a great toll from him. And later on there were men younger and hungrier than he. But Ali was a magician in the boxing ring. He was the embodiment of the sweet science. He beat big men like Liston and George Foreman, smaller men made from iron like Joe Frazier, and hard, hard hitters like George Chuvalo and Earnie Shavers.Unlike most of his predecessors, Ali made his opponents famous, at least in the boxing world. To fight Ali was money in the bank, your name in the newspaper, and the assurance of future fights in the spotlight.Ali was possibly the most recognizable face and name in the world. And its hard to be that famous unless you are a fiction like a movie star or have an army or a movement behind you. Ali was loved because he walked with us and took the barbs and arrows, body blows and head shots, the prejudices and dismissals.He believed in himself absolutely, but that faith did not diminish the rest of us. He loved the crowds who greeted him. They felt it, returned it and fed off it. When I sat next to him at a TransAfrica event in Washington years ago, he told silly jokes that anyone from 6 to 60 could enjoy. He would do magic tricks for people. Alis confidence allowed him the greatest gift  to be just another human being bemused by Creation.He rose, head and shoulders, above us, but those shoulders were broad enough to allow us to climb up there with him and see that were in this together."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trumps campaign is adding staff members to key areas it has been criticized for neglecting, bringing on Jim Murphy as its new national political director and preparing to beef up its communications team.Mr. Murphy, the head of JLM Consulting, was a senior adviser to Bob Doles 1988 and 1996 presidential campaigns and managed floor operations at three Republican conventions. Previously, he was president of DCI Group, a public affairs firm.Mr. Murphys hire comes just over a week after the campaign fired Rick Wiley, who held the position previously but was fired after less than two months. And it also comes amid stumbles by Mr. Trump as he and his team try to ramp up to a more robust operation capable of running a multimillion dollar general election campaign.Mr. Trump and Mr. Murphy spoke by phone over the weekend, and four campaign aides confirmed Mr. Murphys hiring.The campaign has only one person, Hope Hicks, the campaign spokeswoman, overseeing communications, and is hoping to add at least two new hires to help as early as this week.Mr. Murphy got his start in politics working for Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, and also briefly served as deputy political director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the mid-1980s.Paul Manafort, Mr. Trumps campaign chairman who also hired Mr. Wiley, helped bring Mr. Murphy on board. Mr. Murphy also worked with Michael Glassner, the Trump deputy campaign manager, on the Dole campaign in 1996, and he is familiar with the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, from their days working together in New Hampshire. He is also close with Rick Reed, who makes ads for the Trump campaign."}

Sunils challenge seems impossible at first, but has a beautiful solution. Lets try The Jelly Bean JarThere is a retired mathematician who owns a candy store in your town. Not only does she sell amazing sweets, but she is also known to give challenging puzzles to all her customers. One day, in the display window is a large jar of jelly beans a very large jar of jelly beans. And, as one might guess, there is a contest to see who can figure out how many jelly beans there are in this oversize jar. Its not a contest to see who can come closest, its a contest to see who can actually figure out the exact amount.There is a clue that is written on the jar.Starting tomorrow I will remove some jelly beans from the jar. The next day a random customer will remove some. Then the day after, I will remove some more. Every other day I will alternate removing jelly beans with my customers. The only rule is that nobody, including myself, can remove more than half of the remaining jelly beans. The only other thing that I can tell you is that when there is one jelly bean left, I can guarantee 100 percent that it will not be my turn to remove jelly beans! The jar is big. It contains between five and eight thousand jelly beans.Tomorrow I will remove 1,111 jelly beans.How many jelly beans are in the jar?That concludes this weeks puzzle. Well wrap up with the latest from Hamid Naderi Yeganeh, the Iranian student whose work we periodically feature in Numberplay.I asked Hamid to say a bit about the process behind the artwork. Heres his response:The human face is a popular subject in art. And I believe we can draw everything with mathematical formulas. So I started to create a human face to show the power of mathematics in art.It took me almost two months to create this drawing.

{"text": "WASHINGTON  There are few relationships between President Obama and another world leader more unlikely than the one he has with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.The two have a public warmth  or chemistry, as the Indian news media like to describe it  and that is likely to be on display Tuesday when Mr. Modi visits the White House for the second time in two years. It will be the seventh time the two leaders have met.There are compelling reasons the leaders of the worlds largest democracies would find common cause. The United States is encouraging the rise of India as a giant Asian partner to balance China, and India is trying to accelerate its economy with an injection of investment from American companies.It is true that Obama and I have a special friendship, a special wavelength, Mr. Modi said last month in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the presidents deputy national security adviser for strategic communication, said on Saturday that the two leaders have each invested in developing a close relationship.It is worth recounting just how unlikely such a friendship is.The nations first black president, Mr. Obama has made the protection of minorities a central pillar of his life. And he has argued that criticism and dissent are core tenets of democracy.Mr. Modi, by contrast, spent much of his life rising through the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing paramilitary organization that campaigns forcefully for Indias Hindu majority. Mr. Modi was in charge of the state of Gujarat when rioting in 2002 cost the lives of more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. Just last week, 24 people were convicted of massacring Muslims during the riots, and pending cases are attempting to prove that Mr. Modi, who has so far escaped judicial censure, was part of a high-level conspiracy to encourage the killings.Generally poorer and less educated than Indias Hindus, Muslims are about 14 percent of the population, about the same proportion as African-Americans in the United States. In India, Mr. Modis reputation among Muslims could broadly be compared to that of a Southern segregationist from the 1950s.Perhaps just as troubling, Mr. Modis government has increasingly used the countrys broad and vague laws restricting free speech to stifle dissent, according to a recent report by Human Rights Watch. Other laws have been used to intimidate and even shut down nongovernmental organizations, such as Greenpeace.Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Modi is given to displaying affection. Both avoid the socializing common in their capitals. And while Mr. Obama is a doting father and dutiful husband who maintains close bonds with his childhood friends, Mr. Modi abandoned his arranged marriage decades ago and has no children or any public friendships.Some political analysts have expressed deep skepticism that the two leaders have any real fondness for each other.Mr. Modi is part of a class of populist, electable, narcissistic right-wing autocrats whose appeal is that they pander to majoritarian anger, said Kanti Prasad Bajpai, a professor of Asian studies at the National University of Singapore.Obama is the opposite of that, so it is hard to see how close they can be, Mr. Bajpai said.Others see similarities that extend beyond political beliefs.Both men rose from modest circumstances, had difficult relationships with their fathers and were widely considered transformational figures when elected. (Mr. Modis humble origins, largely corruption-free government and intense focus on winning foreign investment are sharp breaks from his predecessor.) And parts of Mr. Modis political operation, in particular its effective use of social media, were based on Mr. Obamas model.Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said both men are remarkably warm and have a personal graciousness about them that is very evident in personal encounters.Raymond E. Vickery, a former United States assistant secretary of commerce who has met Mr. Modi, said both had grown up as outsiders and valued frankness.Modi is a really down-to-earth guy who tries to answer your questions and doesnt just go to talking points, Mr. Vickery said.Mr. Obama made the first significant gesture in the relationship when, during Mr. Modis first official visit to Washington in 2014, the president left his White House staff behind to give a personal 15-minute tour of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial.Mr. Modi responded by inviting Mr. Obama to be his guest at the annual Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi in January 2015. When Mr. Obama arrived, Mr. Modi broke with protocol to greet the president at the airport with a hug. And at a later appearance, Mr. Modi referred to the president as Barack and thanked him for his deep personal commitment to their friendship. In a toast at a state dinner, Mr. Obama called Mr. Modi my partner and friend.The hours theyve spent together, Mr. Rhodes said Saturday, have allowed them to have a good understanding of their respective worldviews and domestic circumstances, and made it possible to deepen defense ties, advance our civil nuclear cooperation and achieve a breakthrough on climate change.He added, Its also an indication of how important President Obama thinks our relationship is with India, as the worlds largest democracy and an increasingly important partner.On Tuesday, White House officials said, the two leaders are expected to discuss climate change and clean energy partnerships, security cooperation, and economic growth. Analysts said the leaders might announce a new defense logistics agreement, further progress on Indias efforts to phase out ozone-depleting hydrofluorocarbons and perhaps a deal for Westinghouse Electric Corporation to build nuclear power plants in India in a long-delayed fulfillment of a pact first struck in 2006.A shared interest in clean power and climate change is central to their personal bond, some analysts said.These two guys get very little political traction at home for being climate champions, but they are anyway, and I think they respect each other for that, said Andrew Light, a former senior adviser to the United States special envoy on climate change.Tavleen Singh, an Indian commentator and admirer of Mr. Modi, said the prime ministers high-profile sanitation campaign and his efforts to improve the status of women would also endear him to Mr. Obama. Still, she said she doubted that the two men were truly affectionate.Zia Haq, an assistant editor at The Hindustan Times in India, was also skeptical.I refuse to believe the two men could be very good personal friends deep down, because Modi is all things Obama cant possibly be, Mr. Haq wrote in an email."}
{"text": "What are we to make of Saudi Arabias investment in Uber?The desert kingdom agreed last week to put $3.5 billion into the ride-sharing service. It is one of the single largest investments in a start-up ever, and Saudi Arabias 5 percent stake values Uber at $62.5 billion, making it by far the most valuable pre-I.P.O. company in Silicon Valley.But the comparisons dont end there. For example: Saudi Arabia pumps about 9.7 million barrels of oil a day, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. With oil at close to $50 a barrel, this was about seven days production. That doesnt sound like much. At this valuation, Uber is worth $10 billion more than Ford, $20 billion more than General Motors, and twice as much as Tesla. Its worth more than three times as much as American Airlines, and four times as much as United Airlines. That sounds like a lot, provided Uber someday turns those make-believe values into real ones. Ubers value is about the same as the value by which Google increased in one day last July. Tech really is magical! So maybe this valuation, for a ride-sharing company that increasingly draws investors and consumers worldwide, is not so much. In April, Uber agreed to pay up to $100 million to its drivers in a dispute over whether the drivers should be considered freelancers or employees. That is about 3 percent of what the kingdom just gave Uber, so it doesnt sound like much. Driving from San Francisco to San Jose, the span of the Silicon Valley, costs about $200 on Uber. For the price of its investment, Saudi Arabia could treat its entire population of 31 million to that ride, if folks didnt mind doubling up. Or one Saudi could just go across Midtown Manhattan 2 billion times. Thats a lot.Admittedly, some of these comparisons are absurd. It is just not entirely clear which ones. If Uber is really changing both transportation and work worldwide, maybe Saudi Arabia just bought into something bigger than we can imagine. If not, well, at these prices the failure will be a big deal, too."}
{"text": "There are supposed to be 27 children in Harold Boyd IVs second-grade classroom, but how many of them will be there on a given day is anyones guess.Since school began in September, five new students have arrived and eight children have left. Two transferred out in November. One who started in January was gone in April. A boy showed up for a single day in March, and then never came back. Even now, in the twilight of the school year, new students are still arriving, one as recently as mid-May.At Public School 188, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, students churn relentlessly in and out. Administrators estimate that nearly half the students enrolled at the school do not last the full year. And how could it be otherwise?Last school year, 47 percent of the students there were homeless. The percentage was higher at only two schools in New York City.The number of homeless people in the city has never been larger, and to spend months in the classrooms of P.S. 188 is to see that this crisis does not play out just in the grown-up world of streets and shelters. It is lived in lunchrooms and libraries, in science labs and math classes, or while perched at a tiny desk trying to learn to read.At P.S. 188, teachers and staff members grapple with problems that stretch the very idea of what a school is supposed to be. Their efforts are visible even in the schools supply closets, where toothbrushes and deodorant are stored along with pencils and paper. A school like P.S. 188 strives to be social worker, advocate, therapist and even Santa Claus.Shoes, for example, are not usually on the list of things a school provides. But P.S. 188 distributed hundreds of pairs this school year. It also gave away backpacks and holiday presents, refurbished computers and uniforms. It is installing a washer and dryer for families whose children come to school without clean clothes.The staff struggles to improve test scores while the students navigate foster care and shelters, and not being able to go back home. And on any given day, the principal of P.S. 188, Suany Ramos, might welcome two or three new students and watch one disappear.They call me the beggar principal, Ms. Ramos said. Everywhere we go, I say, I need, I need, I need for my families.P.S. 188, known as the Island School, opened more than 100 years ago in a classic pink-brick schoolhouse on the Lower East Side.The school spans prekindergarten through eighth grade. It is on the eastern edge of Houston Street, between Avenue D and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, in a neighborhood that has seen an explosion in recent years of expensive residential developments and popular restaurants.Nearly all of the 500 students at P.S. 188 are poor. The school is surrounded on all sides by a fortress of public housing. Most of its students come from these housing projects, as well as from four homeless shelters in the area. One shelter is across the street from P.S. 188, which shares its building with a special education school and a girls charter school.Ms. Ramos is in her second year as principal. She was born in Venezuela to a Dominican father and a Puerto Rican mother and was raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where she still lives. More than 60 percent of the students at P.S. 188 are Hispanic; Ms. Ramos, along with many other teachers and administrators at the school, hops back and forth between English and Spanish throughout the day.By the New York City Education Departments count, 82,514 children in the citys public schools were either in shelters, temporarily staying with relatives or family friends, or in some other makeshift living situation at some point during the last school year. There are about that many students in the entire public school system of Austin, Tex.At 46 New York City schools, at least a third of all students were homeless in the fall of the last school year.That figure includes families living in the shelter system, as well as those who have told the Education Department that they were doubled up, meaning that a family was living with another family, a description that encompasses enormous variation. Parents might check that box if they had lost their apartment and moved in with a cousin and her husband who had a little extra space and a foldout couch.In many instances, however, clutches of children and adults are crammed together in tiny apartments for months, even years. That kind of crowding makes it difficult, maybe impossible, to get a good nights sleep, to discipline a child or to concentrate on homework.During a writing exercise in December, Maicol, a second grader at P.S. 188, wrote to Santa, asking in blocky letters for $10,000 to buy a house. Maicol lived with seven other children and three adults in a small place in Bushwick, Brooklyn  11 people in a one-bedroom apartment.Among children living in shelters, a vast majority are black or Hispanic, and over all, homeless students are disproportionately young. Roughly a third of all students in temporary housing fall between prekindergarten and second grade. There are more homeless children in first grade than any other.The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, announced this year that the city would spend $30 million to address the needs of homeless students. Roughly $20 million of that money will go toward building health clinics at campuses where many students live in shelters.The other $10 million will go to a few initiatives, including placing attendance specialists at the 35 shelters where students go to school the least, and buying BlackBerrys for Education Department employees who are placed in city shelters to help families navigate the school system. Officials at the department said those efforts would build on existing programs for homeless children at shelters and schools.When students are still learning English or need multiple special education services, schools receive additional money for each of those children. But the same is not true for homeless children, creating tremendous challenges for their schools.Liza Pappas, an education policy analyst at the citys Independent Budget Office, said in testimony to the City Council this year that administrators at high-poverty schools were instead asked to set aside $100 for each homeless student from a pot of money they receive to serve all their poor children.Generally, Ms. Pappas said, that $100 does not cover more than a sweatshirt, a uniform or a backpack.This is not a foot, its a wing, Natalie, a first grader, pronounced over a piece of paper titled Bat Facts.She and her classmates were clustered at blue and green tables, in groups of about five, finishing up work on a packet about the flying mammals.JeanCarlos, in a blue hooded sweatshirt, sat by himself at a desk in the front of the room. He was just beginning to color in a diagram of a bat, something his classmates had already done. His teacher, Dilifer Inoa, came and stood beside him to help him puzzle out where to put the word ear.JeanCarlos was behind his classmates that day, Ms. Inoa said, because he had consistently been absent. At a minimum, she said, he would not come to school every Monday and every Friday.Teachers at P.S. 188 like Ms. Inoa are presented with a near-daily choice. Should they review material, and then review it again, so that the students who are in and out of their classrooms are not left too far behind? Or should they plow ahead so that the rest of the class can keep learning new things, and steal moments when they can to give the others a little extra help?It is not just the day-to-day absences of students that frustrate progress through the year, but also the changing composition of the class over all.By the door to Ms. Inoas room, a colorful calendar plots out the birthdays of 31 children, but a class list taped to her desk from the beginning of the school year shows just 24 names.I started with 24 kids, and it went up to 30, Ms. Inoa said. But some left and some came, so its not the same group.By May, she had 27 students. And this year was better than last, she said. Last year, she got new students until the last week of school.With a calm, warm manner, Ms. Inoa, 31, is a teacher in her third year at P.S. 188, the only place she has ever taught. She grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with dreams of being a pediatrician, but she could not afford it, she said. So she became a teacher. Her classroom, with its pale blue floors and sky blue walls, is an open bay of small, squirming children, waves of hands flying in the air whenever she asks a question.JeanCarlos arrived in January, often sleepy and already far behind. Before he joined her class, Ms. Inoa said, he had only ever attended school for a total of a couple of months. That happens sometimes when students arrive with a history of interrupted schooling. But usually, those children have been living abroad. Ms. Inoa said that as far as she knew, JeanCarlos had been living in the Bronx.When he joined her class, he was living in the shelter across the street. After coming to school for a few weeks, he disappeared for two months, Ms. Inoa said. He came back in April, and then he was gone again.JeanCarlos, Ms. Inoa called during attendance one day this spring, scanning her charges. JeanCarlos, she called again, to no response.She marked him absent and moved down the list.Nearly 60 percent of students who live in shelters are chronically absent, according to the Education Department, as are more than a third of all students in temporary housing. That means they miss at least 20 days of school during the year.At P.S. 188, a team of staff members pushes to reduce absences as much as possible.Students who are frequently absent are assigned to staff members who are responsible for checking in with them, and for calling home when they do not show up. Mirta Rosales, the parent coordinator, makes daily calls as well. And to combat an end-of-year drop-off in attendance, which usually starts after testing ends, the school is offering weekly events this month, like a movie night and a barbecue, for the families of students who come to school regularly.Every Friday, administrators and guidance counselors gather in Ms. Rosaless office to discuss each child who has been absent more than twice in the previous 10 days.In a February meeting, they talked about one student, chronically absent, who would not listen to his mother, and suggested social service agencies that might be able to help bring the boy under control. They discussed another family whose mother lived in the shelter across the street and whose father lived in an apartment without electricity or hot water, and another group of siblings who had started walking out of class to wander the halls. Something must be going on at home.The very system meant to help homeless families can keep children out of school in unintended ways. The administrators and guidance counselors also discussed another group of siblings who had missed three days of school. Why? They had to accompany their mother to the Bronx office where all families with children that are entering the shelter system must apply.Children are required to accompany their parents to prove the family makeup as they seek shelter. They can miss school for several days over the course of a 10-day application period. And many families apply more than once. In April, nearly half of the families found to be eligible for shelter had applied at least once before, which means that their children may have been drawn out of school again and again.Advocates for homeless people frequently complain about the requirement. Steven Banks, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration and the Social Services Department, said that as part of a broad review of programs for the homeless, the city was in the process of changing the way families apply for shelter to eliminate as many appointments as possible. At a minimum, it plans to avoid causing children to miss school.Students at P.S. 188 wear uniforms, a polo shirt with the schools name and pictures of the schoolhouse embossed on the left breast. The elementary school students wear navy shirts, and the older children are in maroon.These are also the unofficial uniforms of the shelter across the street.On a warm spring evening, under a sideways-slanting sun, a little girl with a Barbie backpack walked into the shelter deep in concentration, trying not to drip chocolate soft serve on her Island School shirt. Nearby, a boy wearing a navy P.S. 188 polo did flips on the bars of scaffolding just past the guard desk.A few feet away, a sign said Please do not swing on poles, in English and in Spanish.Upstairs, a father and his three young sons, all students at P.S. 188, were getting ready to eat dinner. They had oatmeal served in Tupperware, topped with blueberries. Chicken sauted on the stove. Bananas for appetizers.The father, Cranston, who is being identified by only his given name to protect his familys privacy, favors dark blazers and carries around a harmonica in his pocket. He became homeless last year after he and his wife separated. He and his boys landed in this shelter on the Lower East Side, where they occupy a modest two-bedroom apartment while Cranston looks for work.Its fine, Amiri, the eldest son, said of their living situation. Were only here because my dad got a divorce. Its fine.But Amiri said he missed his old school, a charter in Brooklyn. While he could rattle off a list of activities he had joined at the Island School  art, gymnastics, sports on Saturdays  he said he liked his classmates at his old school better. He had never been in a fight before he came to the Island School, he explained. Now he has.Some of the other kids, he said, they like to talk about a lot of other peoples families, and thats not a good thing. Thats where the fights come up.Amiri could have stayed at his old school. By law, when families move, they are entitled to keep their children enrolled in their schools, even if they move outside the schools zone.But if children stay in their old schools, they may have to travel long distances, even across boroughs, and they will often be late to school.Mr. Boyd, the second-grade teacher, said there was a girl in his class who traveled each day from the Bronx, and she routinely dropped into her seat at 11 a.m. A bright girl who did well in math but struggled with reading, another teacher said, she needed time in class to improve her skills. But in the mornings, she was just not there.The school arranged for her to be tutored by volunteers from Reading Partners, a nonprofit group. The group was told never to come for her in the morning  the girl would not be there.Ms. Ramos, the principal, breezed through the blue hallways of her school in early December, sheathed in her customary black suit and air of purposefulness.I love you, Ms. Ramos, said a second grader, thrusting her face forward.Ms. Ramos paused to smile and answer, I love you, too.Out of earshot, Ms. Ramos explained that the girl thought her mother did not love her. So she needed to be told I love you, and she needed to say it.Walk in the shoes of these families, their issues, for one day, Ms. Rosales, the parent coordinator, said.Ms. Rosaless job is to be the connection for parents at the school, to find answers to their questions when they come to her, and to seek them out if their childrens footing begins to slip. At P.S. 188, she knows everybody. She has lived on the Lower East Side for 30 years and worked at the school for 20.At P.S. 188, Ms. Rosales said, students in temporary housing do not have a monopoly on trauma or difficult circumstances.On a recent spring day, a slight second-grader ran up to his teacher in the hallway to say that a classmate had been hitting him. Before the teacher had a chance to respond, he whipped around and started screaming curses, threatening his classmate with language that would be shocking from an adult. From a child so small, the words were only sad. He has a home, a school staff member said, as well as a sick family member and experience in foster care.I would say 80 percent of our kids could benefit from some kind of counseling, said Jessie Solomon-Greenbaum, who worked as a therapist at P.S. 188 until earlier this year, with a nonprofit group called the Jewish Board of Family and Childrens Services.Some children are separated from their parents or caregivers, perhaps for reasons related to immigration. Many are surrounded by violence in the community that elevates their sensitivity to danger. There is domestic violence  one of the leading reason families end up in the shelter system, according to the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness. There is instability. Nearly two dozen children are in foster care. And for almost all of them, there is poverty.While being uprooted from home can correlate with lower attendance and slipping test scores, teachers at P.S. 188 emphasized that a childs residence in temporary housing does not tell much about him or her.Milagros Ramirez, a dual-language teacher, has taught at the Island School for nearly 20 years and grew up in the area.By now, she knows the address of the shelter across the street, so when she is handed records for new students with that familiar marker, she knows where they are staying. But, she said, she does not know anything else.Ive had kids who are so great and so well behaved who are staying in a shelter, she said. You cant go by, Just because they live there, they behave a certain way. You cant stereotype them.The only thing you can expect, she continued, is that they dont have books, dont have pencils. When I see a kid from the shelter on my list, we start begging. Do you have any book bags upstairs?For all of the challenges they bring to school, they are still just children. Ms. Inoa, the first-grade teacher, said many of her new students stood up on their first day in class and announced their living situation without a hint of shame.The kids say, Oh, Im new, Ms. Inoa said. Im from the shelter.Just before Christmas, two students in Ms. Ramirezs second-grade class came to school wearing matching shoes, simple black sneakers with a blue-and-white Toms label affixed to the back. They had plenty of company marching the halls that day, because the school had received hundreds of pairs of the shoes for students, their siblings and even their parents.In the spring, the halls were a parade of matching backpacks, navy or red, from another school giveaway, all part of an expansive view of what a school provides.The Island School is part of the citys Community Schools program, a longstanding initiative taken up by the Education Department to integrate more support for students and families, like counseling and health clinics, into schools with needy populations. The de Blasio administration has pumped $103 million into its Community Schools program this year at 130 schools.But while P.S. 188 only recently joined the Community Schools program, it has been offering the same kinds of services for more than 15 years.About 20 years ago, there was a break-in at the school during spring recess, Barbara Slatin, the principal at the time, said. It turned out that those who had forced their way inside were students. Ms. Slatin decided that the school should have been open, she said, so she began expanding its hours and tacking on services for families.Today, the building is open on Saturdays, during the summer and every weekday until 6 p.m. It has five social workers, English classes for parents and a washer and dryer that families will be able to use for free. Lawyers come in once a month to help with issues like immigration. And during the winter holiday season, every child gets a present.At a school like P.S. 188, what does success look like?On the standardized state tests taken every year, its scores are flatly disappointing. Only 9 percent of its students met state standards in English last year, compared with 30 percent of students citywide. Just 14 percent of children scored at grade level in math, less than half of the citywide rate of 35 percent.But over the past three years, nearly 50 of its students have been accepted at some of the citys most competitive high schools, including Brooklyn Technical, Stuyvesant and Millennium, Ms. Ramos said. Of the three high schools that students from the Island School attended the most last year, two have above-average graduation rates, while the other caters to children who are still learning English.On annual school surveys, families and teachers give the school and its principal very high ratings. Teachers say they trust the principal and one another. Students say they feel safe and respected, and that they know what their teachers want them to learn. At the Island School, there are outbursts and fights, but the hallways usually feel calm. Children walk from class to class in neat rows, or a rough approximation of them.To Ms. Ramos, when she looks back at the end of the school year and asks herself how the school did, her definition of success reaches far outside the classroom. Is a child who needs counseling now receiving it? Did a father write a rsum? Did a mother get a job?We have so many families who come in with so many issues, Ms. Ramos said. Success is how much we have done for the family, not just for the child.But as hard as many of the teachers and administrators try to reach students and their parents, the moment they break through, the family might be gone.My caseload revolves quite a bit, said Eddy Polanco, a guidance counselor for the elementary students. As much as we hate to see them go, often when they leave, its because theyve found an apartment. So were happy for them."}
{"text": "GYEONGJU, South Korea  She spends hours a day watching the Japanese broadcaster NHK. Her bedside table is stacked with Japanese magazines and figurines in kimonos. The walls bear pictures of Mount Fuji.Shizue Katsura, 96, is among 19 Japanese women who are spending their final days in an unlikely place: a nursing home in South Korea, where lingering anti-Japanese sentiment has helped keep the women in obscurity.There is no use looking back on my life, Ms. Katsura said. Home is where you are living. Japan is a foreign country to me.Thousands of Japanese women like Ms. Katsura married Korean men during Japans colonial rule, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. When World War II ended and Korea was liberated, many stayed with their husbands in Korea, while others fled back to Japan, fearing violence from those looking to avenge the brutal colonial rule.Or, as in Ms. Katsuras case, they followed their husbands from Japan to Korea.Once in Korea, these women often discovered that their husbands families had found them Korean spouses in their absence. Many also lost their husbands during the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 until 1953.By the time many tried to return to Japan, it was too late. Japan and South Korea did not re-establish ties until 1965, and, even then, some of the women had no relatives to sponsor their return and resettlement.Emotions run high when South Koreans talk about their countrys historical disputes with Japan, especially the enslavement of Korean comfort women in front-line brothels for Japans Imperial Army during World War II. But society has paid little attention to these Japanese women, some of whom were abandoned by their families in both countries and had to live with neither a Korean nor a Japanese passport.When they arrive here, they all have made-up Korean names, said Song Mi-ho, the head of the nursing home, Nazarewon, which takes its name from the biblical Nazareth. One of the first things we do is to call them by their Japanese names. When this happens, they are in tears, as if they are getting their life, their identity, back.Once we give their real names back, its amazing how quickly they regain their Japaneseness, the decorum, the way they fold their hands before them when they greet others, Ms. Song said.While sitting in a wheelchair, Ms. Katsura perked up when telling a visitor how she met a kindly Korean man more than seven decades earlier, when they worked in a power station in her hometown, Ebetsu, near Sapporo in northern Japan.But she became taciturn when asked about her life in South Korea.Her husband died of alcoholism decades earlier, she said. She once raised tobacco and livestock in southwestern South Korea, and then sold vegetables in the capital, Seoul, before failing health forced her to move into the nursing home nine years ago.My son, he died early, she said, declining to elaborate.A South Korean philanthropist named Kim Yong-sung was operating orphanages in Gyeongju in southeastern South Korea when he traveled to Japan and saw what looked like Korean women protesting in front of the Japanese emperors palace. They turned out to be Japanese women with South Korean passports demanding that Japan help them regain their citizenship and return home.Mr. Kim opened Nazarewon in 1972 as a way station for these women, providing them with lodging, as well as legal and financial aid. A total of 147 returned home through Nazarewon, the last one in 1984.Nazarewon has since become a nursing home for women who either could not or did not want to return to Japan and had no family support.After 70 years in South Korea, some women preferred living here to ending up at a nursing home in Japan. They like umeboshi, Ms. Song said, referring to the ubiquitous Japanese dish of pickled plums. But they can do without it, but not without the Korean kimchi.More than 80 women have died at Nazarewon during the past 35 years. The average age of the 19 current residents is 92. Many suffer from Alzheimers disease and were not available for interviews.The nursing homes existence rankles some South Koreans.I still get angry calls, asking: What do you think you are doing? Dont you know what the Japanese did to our comfort women? Ms. Song said. I hope what we do here will, in its small and silent way, help heal the ties between the two nations.Chiyo Yagi, 90, said she was a nurse in the Fukuoka prefecture in southern Japan when she fell in love with a Korean translator who would bring injured Korean workers from the nearby Lizuka coal mines to her hospital. When they were married, her father did not attend the wedding.Ms. Yagi, too, did not like to talk about her life in South Korea, though her callused and crooked fingers appeared to reflect a life of menial labor.Korea is a better place for me to live because I at least have a daughter here, she said. My daughter comes to see me once a year.Japanese journalists have visited Nazarewon since a book about the women there was published in Japan in the early 1980s. A church in Japan and the Japanese Embassy in Seoul have provided aid to help Ms. Song operate the nursing home. Japanese tourists who visit this city, the seat of the ancient Silla kingdom and home to numerous Buddhist temples and pagodas, often stop at the nursing home.But their numbers have declined sharply in recent years, as relations between South Korea and Japan have cooled over a territorial dispute and the issue of the comfort women.On a recent afternoon, Nazarewon was shrouded in silence. Women sat motionlessly in wheelchairs, gazing at NHK on a large screen. A few played a card game, counting their scores in Japanese but otherwise speaking Korean. Azaleas blossomed in the front yard.I dont know anything about politics, said Ms. Katsura, who declined to discuss Korean-Japanese relations. What I do know is that if you do well to others, they will do well to you, too. Thats true between people, between nations."}
{"text": "As a prologue to a formal dance piece, a thunderous drum solo is a risky choice. It kicks the show off with a bang, but can the choreography match and maintain that excitement? The achievement of Anna Sperbers Prize is that it largely does.The hourlong work, which had its debut at New York Live Arts on Friday as part of the Joyce Theaters Joyce Unleashed series, has two centers of attention. One is the exceptional drummer Ryan Sawyer, who sits in a back corner coaxing rolls, shimmers, sand storms and other electrifying sounds from his kit. The other is the actual center of the space, the focal point for many of Ms. Sperbers kaleidoscopic designs.After Mr. Sawyers opening salvo, Michael Ingle circles the stage in leaps, tilting toward the center. Once the works five other dancers have joined him, they form a circle, facing inward. Theres a cultish quality to how they stare at one another and conjoin by forehead, but also a tenderness in their touching of cheeks and chins and smalls of the back. That is, until Lizzie Feidelson breaks the spell with a shove. Similarly enlivening jolts of aggression return through the work, crucial counterparts to the unsettling crack of Mr. Sawyers rimshots.Other aspects of drama emerge, particularly in the interactions between Elliott Jenetopuloss evocative lighting and Sara Walshs elegantly spare set design of open wings, hanging strips and a white floor that Mr. Jenetopulos can darken or make gleam like ice. When the lights dim and the dancers twirl ropes above their heads, the whirling hum in the moon glow is hair-raising.But most of the works thrills are kinetic. Solos, especially for the terrific Emma Judkins, meet Mr. Sawyers percussion with an invigorating combination of spinning, space-eating motion and the detail of shimmies and shakes. Hitches and hiccups complicate the choreography without sacrificing momentum. Elsewhere, the dance plays against the drums with stillness and calm.Structurally, the dance is less compelling and original, circling back on itself and ending in the dark with the aural implication that the dancers might keep going forever. Prize isnt a knockout, but measuring up to Mr. Sawyers drumming is enough to make it a winner."}
{"text": "LONDON  It begins with the scene that ended the final book.Right now, we know little more about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the breathlessly awaited new play that  to the joy of fans worldwide  promises an eighth installment of J. K. Rowlings Harry Potter saga. Set 19 years after Harry has defeated his nemesis, Voldemort, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the play gives us a 30-something Harry and centers on his son, Albus Potter, entering his first year at Hogwarts just as Harry did at the start of the series.The play, which has a story line by Ms. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, begins previews at the Palace Theater here on Tuesday, and everything about the production has been shrouded in tantalizing secrecy. A few details  wand design, the stitching on a cloak, cast photos  were revealed to excited fans on Pottermore.com, Ms. Rowlings website. Even these tidbits received a level of online speculation and enthusiasm worthy of a major political event.None of us, all quite experienced in the theater world, have ever experienced anything of this magnitude and intensity before, said Colin Callender, who with Sonia Friedman has produced the show, which is composed of two parts that can be viewed together or on separate days. Mr. Callender was speaking during a round-table conversation on Thursday. With him were Ms. Friedman; Mr. Thorne, who wrote the play; Mr. Tiffany, its director; Jamie Parker, who plays Harry; and Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione. Here are edited excerpts from their conversation about everything but the plot.Sonia Friedman It was absolutely Colins and my idea. We knew that many other producers had approached her and she had rejected their pitches. But thats because they were all ideas about musicals or arena spectacles. We went to her with the simple idea of a straight play. We were clear we didnt want to adapt a novel, and we suggested exploring how Harry, an orphan, would cope as an adult and a parent.Colin Callender We went up to Edinburgh four years ago and sat in a boardroom and talked about fathers and parenting for a while. We said we felt she had created a fully dimensional world, and there were things about the characters she hadnt revealed. We didnt hear anything for a bit, then got the call to say, Lets go to the next stage. She was clear from the beginning that she was not a playwright and wouldnt write it, and that she would only do it if we found a playwright she approved.Friedman We actually thought first about who might direct. Ive been wanting to work with John for 20 years, and he has turned down all my suggestions. I loved his work in Black Watch and Let the Right One In, the kinds of effects he achieved from nothing. So we approached him, and he said we have to do it with Jack.Jack Thorne John came to give a reading when I was a student there, and I approached him afterward and he was terribly nice, and kind enough to read my terrible plays. Then he ran off to run the National Theater of Scotland.Jamie Parker You have abandonment issues, obviously.John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about? I said, Learning to deal with death and grief. There was something in her eye  I thought, we didnt say its about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and were on the right track.Thorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as a starting point.Tiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas.Callender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped.Thorne All right, Im a nerd. With abandonment issues.Thorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, This feels right, this doesnt.Tiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didnt think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon.Friedman Thats enough!Tiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, Why not two parts? And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. Its a cliffhanger.Noma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story.Thorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didnt do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. Its a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent.Tiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself?Dumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that youre not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. Being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. Im fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. As an actor, its something Ive never experienced before.Tiffany Film has got green screen. Weve got the imagination of the audience.Dumezweni I think Jamie found it very intimidating. [Everyone laughs.]Parker Its not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. You have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. But you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that.Dumezweni The weight of expectation is huge. But for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums I know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that I am playing Hermione. Ultimately its a theater piece, Im a theater actor and doing a job as best I can.Callender Im hopeful after seeing how people were about Star Wars. They mostly protected the fans.Tiffany It will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on July 30, so that its not our secret to keep. But if you dont read it, and you choose not to read reviews, weve made it possible to come without prior knowledge.Parker And you dont get that much nowadays. So often things are ruined because you know so much.Dumezweni Ive quite loved the secrecy. Although, of course, my home life is [expletive]. My daughter tries to guess what is in the play. She says, Just smile at me if Im right.Tiffany My mum is the only problem. Everyone else is fine. She asks really specific questions; then I discovered people are quizzing her in her local supermarket.Parker When people ask, I just pull out a wand, and go, Im a wizard!"}
{"text": "Dear Diary:I was in Chinatown on Sunday shopping and saw for sale dried bamboo leaves and balls of string and they reminded me, Its springtime and time for deung.Every Chinese person knows about deung, mini-bricks of sticky rice with meat or chicken, Chinese sausage, egg yolk and nuts wrapped in bamboo leaves, tied with string and boiled. They were good! Every spring my mom and her friends used to make them in batches of more than 100. They are a celebration of spring and good harvest, made by mothers caring hands with love and given out to family and friends to enjoy  like fruitcake at Christmas, except deung are actually eaten.Sure enough, a little old lady is on the sidewalk with a dozen deung spread out in front of her for sale. She says, Buy them, they taste very good. I ask how much? She says $1.75 so I ask for one.You cant have just one, theyre really good and very pretty, you need two. I agree to two for $3.50 and pull out a $5 bill. She sees the bill and says, Ill throw in another one  three for $5 instead of $5.25. O.K.? and proceeds to put three in a bag.What could I say? I gave her the $5 bill and took the three deung. I am lucky she did not talk me out of all the money in my pockets.With a little soy sauce, the deung was good, but it did not have the sausage or egg yolk of Moms deung, and Moms had more meat and tasted better. It was not as good as Moms; it seems nothing ever is. The old lady was right. One was not enough; I ate two."}
{"text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich.  Here in this college town 40 miles west of Detroit, behind black sheeting attached to an eight-foot-tall chain-link fence, the future of the auto industry is being worked out in a secret setting.The fence surrounds a testing center called Mcity  a 32-acre patch of land that aims to recreate Anywhere, U.S.A., complete with simulated city streets and intersections. Within its borders are 13 types of traffic lights, storefronts, road signs, parking meters and a tunnel. A railroad crossing will be added soon.Mcity is one of a half-dozen or so testing grounds for autonomous vehicles in the world as automakers and technology companies engage in a heated competition to create the perfect self-driving car  and to keep their competitors from knowing how they are doing it.But while they have honed the technologies that enable cars to find their way on their own, these companies now face an even more daunting challenge: how to take that technology, with all its promise, and make those cars perform flawlessly in an unpredictable world.Both the car companies and regulators have decades of experience making vehicles safer in crashes, but the means and methods for validating the reliability and safety of self-driving cars have not even been invented.When you no longer have a human doing the sensing and decision-making, the car has to be flawless, said John Maddox, an assistant director at the University of Michigan Mobility Transformation Center.Mcity officials can name the companies that use the site  Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and the auto parts suppliers Bosch and Delphi, among others  but little beyond that. Demonstrations for the public or media are rare.After all, Mcity is a place for trial and error, outside of the public eye, in an industry where errors can cripple a reputation.On a recent sunny afternoon, a gap in the sheeting afforded a view of a black Lincoln MKZ sedan with sensors mounted on its roof and two engineers in the front seats. It crept cautiously toward an intersection, slowed to a stop and executed a right turn, using its turn signal, of course. The black car made its way through the artificial downtown.Moments later, a white Lincoln MKS rolled along a straightaway at about 25 miles per hour, swept around a wide left turn and negotiated its way through the downtown. Later, the cars stopped side by side under a green highway sign indicating a nonexistent ramp for I-96 to Lansing. There, the occupants stepped out to examine the rooftop sensors. After a long pause, the two cars repeated the same trek at a deliberate pace  much more slowly than the cars traveling on the public roads surrounding the site.The testing is being conducted with the utmost care because the number of unanticipated challenges that arise on the road is almost limitless  a fallen limb, black ice, a reckless driver, a toddler in the street.There are real and significant questions about the safety of new technologies, Mark Rosekind, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said at an April 27 meeting in California. The old model of counting vehicle miles and counting crashes and injuries is not sufficient.This month, the safety agency, which has limited authority to regulate the practice of test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, cautiously gave approval to several companies to begin testing on public roadways.But the industry is not waiting around.In addition to its Mcity effort, the University of Michigan is a partner in a project to set up a much more complex site about 10 miles away in neighboring Ypsilanti. It will be called the American Center for Mobility and will comprise 335 acres that were once part of G.M.s Willow Run plant. During World War II, it was the site of a famed bomber factory. Mr. Maddox has been named the centers chief.Unlike Mcity, this larger site will have long stretches where autonomous cars can be tested at highway speeds and space for creating a variety of complex intersections. Its existing roadways include overpasses and bridges.Ford is interested in potentially using the Willow Run facility, said Randy Visintainer, Fords director of autonomous vehicle development. It is something we would probably have to create if it didnt exist, he said.In California, a former military base has been turned into a 2,100-acre test site called GoMentum Station, where Honda has been testing its autonomous driving technology. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment. It is also a secure location where companies can test cars in private.Outside Blacksburg, Va., Virginia Tech set up a test site that incorporates stretches of public roads and a closed track.The challenge, by all accounts, is enormous.This year, an Audi executive mused upon how difficult it would be for a driverless car to distinguish between a shopping cart and a baby carriage. Delphi has reported that the systems it is working on struggle at times to read traffic lights. The problem? The glare of a setting sun.The bottom line is if you have a 4,000-pound car in the same space as a 200-pound human, you have to know the vehicle is going to react exactly the way you want every single time, Mr. Maddox said. Its going to take a lot of testing to validate that.The Willow Run test track is supposed to have an engineering center where Mr. Maddox hopes automakers and regulators can work together to develop new test methods.So far, most of the testing of autonomous vehicles has taken place on public streets.Google says its cars have driven more than 1.5 million miles in the testing it conducts on roads near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. In recent months, it has expanded its testing program to Kirkland, Wash., Austin, Tex., and Phoenix. All other companies have accumulated far fewer test miles.Mr. Maddox suspects that is a small fraction of the testing that needs to be done. On average, he noted, a fatal accident happens once for every 100 million miles that Americans drive. We are a long way from having enough experience, he said.A recent study by the RAND Corporation concluded that autonomous vehicles might have to be driven hundreds of millions, or even billions, of miles to reach a statistical certainty of their safety.Moreover, on-road trials fall short of what is needed. If an autonomous car doesnt react properly in a real-world situation  if, for example, a buildings shadow causes the car to slow suddenly  the situation cannot be recreated and repeated to identify the issue and fine-tune the cars sensors, said Huei Peng, an engineering professor and director of the University of Michigan Mobility Transformation Center.We have to see how these vehicles interact with their surroundings and need repeatable, reliable tests to do that, he said.And crashes do occur. Googles cars, as of last September, had 16 crashes, and all were because of human error, the company said at the time. In a report to California regulators, Google disclosed that human drivers had to take control of its test cars 341 times in a 15-month period covering 2014 and 2015, including 13 incidents when the car would have crashed had the driver not intervened.Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are working together to have a test fleet of 100 minivans driving themselves around roads in Michigan and elsewhere by the end of the year. Google is setting up an engineering center in Novi, Mich., to equip the minivans with self-driving technology.In the same time frame, Ford plans to expand its fleet to 30 self-driving prototypes from 10. G.M. and its partner, the ride-hailing start-up Lyft, hope to have a test fleet of driverless taxis running within a year."}
{"text": "Peter Shaffer, a leading British playwright whose Tony-winning dramas Equus and Amadeus explored the male psyche through the entwined anguish of dual protagonists, died on Monday in County Cork, Ireland. He was 90.His agent, Rupert Lord, confirmed the death. Sir Peter had traveled to Ireland to celebrate his 90th birthday with close friends and relations, Mr. Lord said in an email. Mr. Shaffer turned 90 on May 15. Mr. Shaffer, who lived in Manhattan for more than 40 years, died in a hospice in Curraheen, a district outside Cork City.Valued by critics and audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. Shaffer (pronounced SHAFF-er) saw his reputation amplified by well-received movie renderings of his plays. He won an Academy Award for his film adaptation of Amadeus, about the rivalry between Antonio Salieri, the court composer for the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the precocious composer whose magnificent gifts thrill the older man and fill him with malicious jealousy as he realizes his own consignment to mediocrity.As a playwright Mr. Shaffer was ambitious, probing in a variety of genres. His first Broadway play, Five Finger Exercise, was a 1950s domestic drama about a British family with culturally mismatched parents and the emotional fissures that are unwittingly exposed by a young German tutor brought into their household. (The Hollywood version, starring Rosalind Russell and Maximilian Schell, was Americanized and set in California.)It was followed by The Private Ear and The Public Eye, a pair of one-act comedies involving lopsided romances and a third wheel, and The Royal Hunt of the Sun, about the 16th-century vanquishing of the Incas by the Spanish. It starred Christopher Plummer as the conquistador Francisco Pizarro and David Carradine as the Incan ruler Atahualpa. (For the 1969 film version, Mr. Plummer played Atahualpa; Robert Shaw was Pizarro.)All were received with at least respectful (and often quite admiring) critical notices, and ran on Broadway for several months. So did another pair of one-act comedies, Black Comedy and White Lies, which featured Michael Crawford and Lynn Redgrave in their Broadway debuts. But Mr. Shaffers best known and most substantial work lay ahead.He drew his inspiration for Equus from a story a friend told him about a British stable boy  the teenage son of forbidding, religion-oriented parents  who had compulsively blinded a number of horses in his care after being seduced by a young woman on the floor of the stable. The horses were around them ostensibly, at least in the mind of the boy, watching them.From that episode, the play evolved into an intimate, tense wrangle between the boy, Alan Strang, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Dysart. The psychiatrists own chill marriage, doubts about the efficacy of his profession and interest in ancient Greek history add depth to the relationship and the resonance of myth to the story of the boys gruesome and mysterious act.The production, a vivid one directed by John Dexter, included men in silver masks representing the blind horses and a long nude scene recapitulating the barn seduction. It opened in 1973 in London and in October 1974 on Broadway, with Anthony Hopkins as Dysart and Peter Firth as Strang. It ran there nearly three years, winning Tonys for best play and best director.The production also attracted a remarkable parade of replacements for Mr. Hopkins, including Anthony Perkins, Alec McCowen, Leonard Nimoy and Richard Burton. Burton subsequently starred in the 1977 film version, directed by Sidney Lumet. (A 2008 Broadway revival starred Richard Griffiths as Dysart and Daniel Radcliffe as Strang.)Though the play drew much praise  stunning, Walter Kerr called it in The New York Times  it also courted controversy. A few amateur shrinks (that is, critics) offered a variety of interpretations, including that the play was about closeted homosexuality  a suggestion that especially flummoxed Mr. Shaffer  and professional ones complained about the portrayal of their profession.By weaving together many clinical syndromes, therapeutic methods and psychoanalytic clichs, Shaffer presents us with a fictitious piece of psychopathology, one doctor, Sanford Gifford, wrote in an article in The Times, adding that the playwrights skillful mixture of truth, banality and pretension establishes a spurious air of importance.In Amadeus, set in Vienna in the late 18th and early 19th century, Mr. Shaffer took on the mystery of genius  in this case in the guise of a musical visionary who imagined whole, elaborately gorgeous compositions in his head, but who presented himself to the world as a boor and a self-destructive libertine. That Mozarts music, of which Salieri speaks reverently as the voice of God, could be created by such an unholy man, is a torment that Salieri cannot abide, and he works to undermine Mozarts success  and his health  only to be riddled by guilt for decades after Mozart dies at the age of 35.The play opened at the National Theater in London in 1979, directed by Peter Hall, with Paul Scofield as Salieri and Simon Callow as Mozart. The next year, with Ian McKellen and Tim Curry in the leading roles, Mr. Hall staged it on Broadway, where the production won five Tonys and ran for three years. (There was a Broadway revival, also directed by Mr. Hall, with David Suchet as Salieri and Michael Sheen as Mozart, in 1999.)Amadeus was widely scrutinized for historical accuracy, and scholars later debunked the portrayal of Mozart as a puerile genius poisoned by Salieri. (One Mozart biographer, Robert M. Gutman, who died in May, maintained that Mozart died from illness, possibly rheumatic fever.)Mr. Shaffer admitted that though there may have been some rivalry between the two men, he took considerable artistic license in creating their characters and ratcheting up Salieris antipathy to such a malevolent degree.The problem with the Mozart-Salieri story is that there is no end, he said in an interview with the William Inge Center for the Arts, in Inges hometown, Independence, Kan. One survived the other by 32 years. Its not much of a climax. There had to be a scene between them, a confrontation scene. In a play, thats what drama demands.It was a scene he rewrote over and over again, he said, finally settling on what he called an offering  Mozarts offering up a score of the unfinished Requiem Mass in D minor to a masked patron, who is, of course, Salieri.For the 1984 film, directed by Milos Forman and starring Tom Hulce as Mozart and F. Murray Abraham as Salieri, Mr. Shaffer wrote an entirely new ending, imagining a scene in which Mozart, on his deathbed, dictates part of the Requiem as Salieri scribbles out the score. The music is played on the films soundtrack during the scene, and as Salieri recognizes the glory of the composition, it is almost as though he is receiving, as if by communion wafer, a morsel of godliness.That, Mr. Shaffer said, was for him the most exciting scene in the film, because it breaks all the rules that Id ever been taught about cinema, that it has to be visual and the sound doesnt matter very much.Its a scene about sound, he said. The characters dont move. He added: If you read the script, its nothing but eight pages of musical direction: Bar this, Oboe in E-flat and so forth. Very boring. It would give the average Hollywood producer a heart attack to read those eight pages. But they do work and they work wonderfully. And even more mysteriously, they are cinema; theyre not theater. If you had that scene on the stage, with a stage manager winding back a tape in the wings, it wouldnt work at all.Peter Levin Shaffer was born on May 15, 1926, in Liverpool, along with his fraternal twin, Anthony, and grew up in London, where his father worked in real estate. The twins attended St. Pauls School in London until 1944, when they went to work in the coal mines of Yorkshire and Kent for three years as an alternative to military service. In 1947 Peter Shaffer won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history.After his graduation in 1950, the brothers published How Doth the Little Crocodile?, the first of several mystery novels they wrote under the joint pseudonym Peter Anthony. Anthony Shaffer, who studied law, eventually became a noted playwright himself, winning a best-play Tony before his brother did, for the 1971 murder mystery Sleuth, which ran for 1,222 performances, eclipsing the runs (barely) of Equus and Amadeus.The brothers were reportedly close and on largely good terms, but it is notable that Mr. Shaffers plays so often focused on pairs of male rivals  Pizarro and Atahualpa, Dysart and Strang, Salieri and Mozart  whose competition delivers both nourishment and suffering.We are both poisoned, Amadeus, Salieri says at the end of the play. I with you; you with me.After leaving Cambridge, Peter Shaffer soon moved to New York, where he worked in a bookstore and at the New York Public Library before returning to England.His first play, The Salt Land, about the fledgling state of Israel, was produced on television by the BBC in 1954. Four years later he scored his first major theatrical success with Five Finger Exercise. Directed by John Gielgud, it opened on Broadway in 1959 with a cast that included Jessica Tandy, Roland Culver and Brian Bedford.Mr. Shaffers other plays included Yonadab (1985), a biblical saga about evil doings in King Davids court; and, most notably, the comedy Lettice and Lovage (1987), which starred Maggie Smith in London and, in 1990, on Broadway.As Lettice Douffet  the most eccentric tour guide ever to lead bored American and Japanese visitors through one of Englands dullest stately homes, as The Timess Frank Rich described the character  Ms. Smith won raves and a Tony, as did her co-star, Margaret Tyzack, as her stuffy employer.Mr. Shaffer was knighted in 2001. His brother Anthony died in 2001. He is survived by another brother, Brian.At midpoint in his career, in a 1975 interview in The Times, Mr. Shaffer admitted to a sense of fulfillment stemming from the work he had already done. He also looked ahead.When Im 100, he said, if I manage to write lots of plays, I can read them all in a row and it may give me some vague sense  only vague  of what I am, and was."}

He was arguably the best heavyweight fighter of all time, but we remember his life for so much more. He was an iconic civil rights advocate and a prodigious fund-raiser for Parkinsons disease, which he lived with for more than three decades.He was incredibly devoted to his Muslim faith. Rather than be drafted and serve in the Vietnam War, which he objected to on religious and political grounds, he was stripped of his boxing title and faced imprisonment.Such devotion to principle is something we can all aspire to. For this he will always have a place in my memory.KEN DEROWSwarthmore, Pa.To the Editor:As we celebrate the life of Muhammad Ali, an illustrious athlete, I hope the sport in which he participated, and which crippled him, will not be extolled or glorified.The legal savagery of boxing is a stain on our nation. Although it brought Ali fame and fortune, it robbed him of a full life from an early age because of countless hits to the head from those who sought to achieve the perverse goal of knocking out the opponent.Muhammad Ali was indeed the Greatest, but I wonder if he would have traded what he accomplished in the boxing ring in order to have had a long and healthy life.A society such as ours does not need any encouragement to engage in violence. Impressionable children are watching.OREN M. SPIEGLERUpper St. Clair, Pa.To the Editor:The sad news of the passing of the legend Muhammad Ali brought back a childhood memory. Back in 1973, I was a 12-year-old kid from New Jersey on my way to a youth football bowl game against a team from Atlanta.I was a big Joe Frazier fan who respected his quiet toughness and disliked Alis outspoken ways, considering him a loudmouth and a braggart. As our team reached the Atlanta airport I saw a huge crowd gathering and ran over to see what was going on. It was Ali and his entourage surrounded by autograph seekers.But this wasnt the Ali I saw on TV. Here was this huge, gentle, smiling man taking the time to sign all the kids autographs, including mine. As he signed mine, he smiled, winked and said, Dont you feel sorry for me having to sign all these?I came to realize that here was a special man  much kinder and greater in spirit than I realized. That simple moment changed my mind about him  and changed me so I was more open-minded, reflective and considerate about people I didnt truly know.GREGG GEIDERRidgewood, N.J.To the Editor:He came to us as a curiosity and stayed as an icon.Muhammad Ali was a fighter with quick fists, quick wit and an indomitable spirit.In refusing to be drafted during the Vietnam War, he willingly forfeited riches and his crown, and would have given up even his freedom, if it had come to that, following the dictates of his religion and his heart. He might have arrived as part showman but he remained as a dedicated, serious ambassador for his beliefs.Parkinsons may have sapped him of his most obvious strengths, making him a physical shadow of his earlier self and taking away much of the sound of his voice.But he had the heart of a lion, and the will of David against Goliath. He lived a life equal parts passion and compassion.Muhammad Ali died a legend and a hero to countless millions around the globe.Forever may he be recalled as one who was both butterfly and bee, a man filled with enduring beauty, grace and power.ROBERT S. NUSSBAUMFort Lee, N.J.To the Editor:I will never forget the pair of boxing gloves from Muhammad Ali hanging on the wall of Ted Kennedys Senate office in Washington.

{"text": "RICHMOND, Va.  On the night Barack Obama became the nations first black president, Leah Taylor, a fast-food worker and African-American mother of six, stayed up until 2 a.m. watching the election returns. I knew that was history, and I wanted to be a part of it, she said. But she did not vote.Ms. Taylor, 45, has never voted. In 1991, when she was 20, she was stripped of her voting rights after being convicted of selling crack cocaine and sent to jail for a year. So she was stunned when an organizer from a progressive group, New Virginia Majority, showed up one recent afternoon at the church soup kitchen where she eats lunch and said he could register her.Your rights have been restored! the organizer, Assadique Abdul-Rahman, declared with a theatrical flourish, waving an executive order signed in April by Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Ms. Taylor, so moved she nearly cried, promptly signed up.Thus did Ms. Taylor join a wave of newly eligible voters, all with criminal pasts, signing up in Virginia. But what Mr. McAuliffe granted, the Virginia Supreme Court may now take away.Top Republicans in the state legislature are seeking to block Mr. McAuliffes sweeping order, which re-enfranchised 206,000 Virginians who have completed sentences, probation or parole. Last week, the Supreme Court announced a special session to hear arguments in July  in time to rule before the November election.The suit has plunged Virginia and Mr. McAuliffe  a Democrat and close friend of Hillary Clintons, the partys likely presidential nominee  into yet another racially charged voting rights battle. In May, a federal judge upheld a Republican-backed law requiring Virginia voters to provide photo identification, while the Supreme Court let stand a court-imposed redistricting map, drawn to address Democrats complaints of racially motivated gerrymandering.This next fight over restoring voting rights to convicted felons  an issue playing out nationally  could affect the presidential contest and Mrs. Clintons fortunes in Virginia, a critical swing state. Ever since Mr. McAuliffes order on April 22, progressive groups have been waging a furious registration campaign; as of Friday, state elections officials said, more than 5,800 newly eligible voters had signed up.This could get really messy, said Tram Nguyen, an executive director of New Virginia Majority, a leader in the registration campaign. What happens if the executive order gets overturned? Theres no precedent; 5,800 people are actively on the registration rolls now. Do we purge them?That is precisely what Republicans are asking. In addition to overturning the order, they want the new registrations nullified  a request Ms. Taylor calls appalling.A teenage mother when she went to jail, Ms. Taylor said her time there gave me clarity. After her release in 1992, she said, she performed community service, folding clothes in a Salvation Army store, and paid the state $15,000 in fines, with money inherited from her mother. Today, she has part-time jobs at McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken, and dabbles in advocacy, lobbying lawmakers on behalf of Fight for $15, a coalition pushing to raise the minimum wage. She likes both Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, and counts herself a Democrat.I did my time; I did everything I was supposed to do, she said. I paid the courts, I paid the fines and got my life back on track.In issuing his sweeping order, Mr. McAuliffe made expansive use of his clemency powers to effectively nullify a Civil War-era provision in the State Constitution that barred convicted felons from voting for life  one of the harshest disenfranchisement policies in the nation. In an interview previewing his announcement, Mr. McAuliffe said his legal authority to do so is ironclad. But Republicans say the governor lacks blanket authority to restore voting rights and must instead do so on a case-by-case basis  as his predecessors in both parties have done.Hes really put a stick in the legislatures eye, said Speaker William J. Howell of the Virginia House of Delegates, the lead plaintiff in the Republican suit. He said the suit has nothing to do with the registration drive, and rejected Democrats accusations that Republicans were trying to suppress the black vote: The governor has whipped them up.Still, race is a powerful subtext; African-Americans make up 19 percent of Virginias population, but 45 percent of those covered by the governors order. The Sentencing Project, a Washington research organization, says one in five African-Americans in Virginia cannot vote because of felony convictions.When you look at the fact that of the individuals who are most impacted by this, 45 percent of them are African-American, what conclusion can we draw? asked State Senator Mamie Locke, chairwoman of the Virginia Black Legislative Caucus, which held Voices for The Vote rallies on Saturday in three Virginia cities.Organizers of the registration drive say they would like to sign up 25,000 new voters in time to cast ballots on Election Day.That could make a difference, said Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in Virginia, noting that some state races in Virginia had been decided by relatively slim margins, of 5,000 or 6,000 votes.Here in Richmond, the capital, the registration campaign is most intense in some of the poorest corners of the city, in places like Gilpin Court, a public housing development in Jackson Ward, a historically African-American neighborhood. Karen Fountain, another New Virginia Majority organizer, has signed up so many people that residents have named her The Voter Lady.Ms. Fountain estimated that roughly three-quarters of those she encounters in Gilpin Court have lost their right to vote. On a sweltering Friday afternoon, she walked the neighborhoods streets, asking people if they had heard what Governor Terry, as she calls Mr. McAuliffe, had done. Many had not; some remain ineligible.I cant; I just got home, one tattooed young man replied, when Ms. Fountain asked if he wanted to register. Are you on probation? she asked. He nodded his head yes. Supervised? she asked. He nodded again. O.K., Ms. Fountain said, when you get off, you can register.For Mr. Abdul-Rahman, a cheery 53-year-old with a corny expression  Cool bananas!  for things that please him, the work is deeply personal. He spent 17 years in prison, for armed robbery and breaking and entering. In prison, he read history books and taught himself about politics. When he heard about the governors order, he signed up to vote, and began registering others.Then New Virginia Majority hired him; the day he met Ms. Taylor was his first day of work. Standing outside the church, on a thin grassy patch under a shady crepe myrtle tree, he registered 11 new voters during the lunch hour  some homeless, some struggling with addiction to drugs. None seemed happier than Ms. Taylor.Oh my goodness, she said, giving Mr. Abdul-Rahman a hug after signing her papers. This is such a beautiful day."}
{"text": "Prosecutors are the most powerful players in the American criminal justice system. Their decisions  like whom to charge with a crime, and what sentence to seek  have profound consequences.So why is it so hard to keep them from breaking the law or violating the Constitution?The short answer is that they are almost never held accountable for misconduct, even when it results in wrongful convictions. It is time for a new approach to ending this behavior: federal oversight of prosecutors offices that repeatedly ignore defendants legal and constitutional rights. There is a successful model for this in the Justice Departments monitoring of police departments with histories of misconduct.Among the most serious prosecutorial violations is the withholding of evidence that could help a defendant prove his or her innocence or get a reduced sentence  a practice so widespread that one federal judge called it an epidemic. Under the 1963 landmark Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland, prosecutors are required to turn over any exculpatory evidence to a defendant that could materially affect a verdict or sentence. Yet in many district attorneys offices, the Brady rule is considered nothing more than a suggestion, with prosecutors routinely holding back such evidence to win their cases.Nowhere is this situation worse than in Louisiana, where prosecutors seem to believe they are unconstrained by the Constitution.This month, the Supreme Court will consider the latest challenge to prosecutorial misconduct in Louisiana in the case of David Brown, who was one of five men charged in the 1999 murder of a prison guard. Mr. Brown said he did not commit the murder, but he was convicted and sentenced to death anyway. Only later did his lawyers discover that prosecutors had withheld the transcript of an interview with another prisoner directly implicating two other men  and only those men  in the murder.This is about as blatant a Brady violation as can be found, and the judge who presided over Mr. Browns trial agreed, throwing out his death penalty and ordering a new sentencing. But the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed that decision, ruling that the new evidence would not have made a difference in the jurys sentence.David Browns case is a good example of how every part of the justice system bears some responsibility for not fighting prosecutorial misconduct. State courts often fail to hold prosecutors accountable, even when their wrongdoing is clear. Professional ethics boards rarely discipline them. And individual prosecutors are protected from civil lawsuits, while criminal punishment is virtually unheard of. Money damages levied against a prosecutors office could deter some misconduct, but the Supreme Court has made it extremely difficult for wrongfully convicted citizens to win such claims.This maddening situation has long resisted a solution. What would make good sense is to have the federal government step in to monitor some of the worst actors, increasing the chance of catching misconduct before it ruins peoples lives. The Justice Department is already authorized to do this by a 1994 federal law prohibiting any pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives a person of legal or constitutional rights.The department has used this power to monitor police departments in Los Angeles, New Orleans, Detroit and Seattle, among other municipalities with a history of brutality, wrongful arrests, shootings of unarmed civilians and other illegal or unconstitutional practices. For the most part, the results have been positive. Since prosecutors are also law enforcement officers, there is no reason they and their offices should be immune from federal oversight.Of course, many district attorneys offices will balk at being put under a federal microscope. But nothing else has worked to prevent misconduct by prosecutors, and the Justice Department is uniquely equipped to ferret out the worst actors and expose their repeated disregard for the law and the Constitution."}
{"text": "Nobuyuki Matsuhisa  is a chef and co-founder of the restaurant chains Nobu and Matsuhisa.Q. What is your family background?A. I was born in 1949 in Saitama, a city near Tokyo where my parents had moved during the Second World War. I was the youngest of four children. My father died in a motorcycle accident when I was eight. My mother lived to be 93, and passed away 10 years ago.Q. When did you first become interested in cuisine?A. My mother and brothers worked outside the house, and I spent most of my time at home, watching my grandmother cook in the kitchen. Back then, men did not go much into the kitchen, but as a child, I was always in the kitchen. When I turned 12, my brother took me for the first time to a sushi restaurant. Sushi was a very high-end food then, unlike today where it is sold in every supermarket. I remember walking into the restaurant through the sliding doors, being greeted ceremoniously, and sitting nervously at the counter. I was both impressed and excited and decided then and there that I wanted to become a sushi chef.At school, I was a bad boy and was always getting into trouble. I was expelled from school before I could obtain a high school diploma. So I took a job in a family-run sushi restaurant in Tokyo.Q. What did you learn on that first job?A. I went to the fish market every day, watched as the chef selected the fish, and carried his basket. I helped clean the fish, serve lunch and dinner and clean up at night. This went on for several years until a sous-chef quit and I was allowed to slice fish and make sushi.The seven years I spent in that job were important ones. I learned to make sushi the traditional way. Today, I teach sushi classes, and I tell my students that making sushi is like giving a hearty handshake; you must use all ten fingers.I also understood the importance of teamwork, especially that of the dishwashers, without whom a chef cannot function. Today, when I visit any one of my own restaurants around the world, I always stop by the kitchen and say hello to everyone, including the busboys, because I know how difficult their job is.Q. How did you transition from a traditional sushi chef to fusion cuisine, for which your restaurants are known?A. A client of the sushi restaurant offered me a partnership in Lima, Peru. I had just gotten married and was interested in pursuing other opportunities, so my wife and I agreed to move to Peru. There, we found a very different sushi culture. It was my chance to show them how sushi was made in Japan. But the local fish supply was completely different and the food culture was centered around ingredients like lemon juice, ceviche, chili peppers, cilantro, olive oil, and tomatoes rather than just soy sauce and wasabi.I learned in Peru that I could free myself of the ceremonial ways of Japanese cuisine and experiment with new flavors. I had no choice but to embrace the local culture. It opened my eyes to the fact that there was more than one way to make sushi.We stayed in Lima for three years, business was good and my first daughter was born. Then, a disagreement with my partner led to the breakup of our business relationship. We left Peru and I tried working in Argentina for a year but business was slow, and with my wife pregnant with our second daughter, we decided to return to Japan. It was the end of my South American dream.Q. But you were itching to leave your native Japan?A. I had spent years outside the country, and I felt I had nothing more to learn from Japan. When a friend suggested Anchorage, Alaska, I discussed the idea with my wife. She has always supported me, though not always happily, but she agreed and allowed me to follow my dream again.In Alaska, the oil pipeline brought a lot of people, and there was little restaurant competition. I opened a sushi place with a loan from a new partner. The fish was not varied there but within the first few weeks and much hard work, we were a success.On Thanksgiving Day, after many weeks, I finally took a day off. That same night, I received a call from my partner informing me that an electrical short had caused a fire and the restaurant had burned down to the ground. We had no insurance and I had no means of repaying my loan. I was devastated.That was the lowest point of my life. I thought only about ending my life. But every day, when I returned home, my children were happy to see their father. At age 3 and 1.5, all they wanted to do was play. I can say today that my family and the laughter of my children saved me.After Alaska, I decided that I would never rush in my business again and that I would rebuild step by step.Q. Why did you go back into a partnership structure with your restaurants?A. After Anchorage, I wanted to keep my business small and manage it alone. It was 1979, and I had to send my family back to Japan and I settled in Los Angeles alone and took a job as a sushi chef in a small restaurant. After a few years, I obtained a green card and brought my family over. In 1987, with a loan of $60,000, I opened Matsuhisa on La Cienega, without any partners.The first two years were very difficult. We barely broke even. There was mostly frozen fish being served then in sushi restaurants, and I started importing fresh fish from Japan. That was not innovative per se, it was more a desire to serve quality food, and my clients took notice.One day, Robert De Niro came into Matsuhisa. I did not know him then because I dont go to the movies. He invited me to New York, showed me around a building in Tribeca and explained his dream to open a restaurant. I was not ready to take that step. But Bob continued to come to Matsuhisa.Four years later, he asked me again about New York, and this time, I felt I could trust him. Together, we started Nobu in New York in 1994. He was a big reason for the success of the restaurant. We now have 32 Nobu restaurants and Bob is my partner in all of them. I have also opened eight Matsuhisa restaurants with other partners. Next January, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Matsuhisa in Los Angeles.Q. How do you manage your businesses globally?A. I am very much involved in managing my restaurants. In hiring, I look for technical skills, leadership qualities, and people with a good sense of teamwork. I work with managers who understand my way of working and my philosophy, so they can become part of the family. The chef in a restaurant must be a father figure.Q. What makes a great leader?A. A great leader must have vision, respect people, and see things from the other persons point of view.Q. What is the best advice you have received?A. The best lesson I have learned is to take one step at a time in business. You cannot skip steps because that means missing out on experience.Q. What would you tell a young person starting out?A. Try to do your best, live your life with passion, and dont forget to appreciate what you have."}
{"text": "ISTANBUL  THE Islamic holy month of Ramadan begins today and with it the long hours of fasting by hundreds of millions of Muslims. The daylong fast during the lunar month in which we Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is a way for Muslims to show their devotion to God, and, some say, to understand the suffering of those who have no choice but to go without food.The Ramadan fast is not easy. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims are not supposed to eat, drink or smoke, and abstain from sex. For hours, they dream about a sip of water or a bite of bread. Then comes the iftar, which means breakfast, but which is often a heavy dinner with family and friends. Then come a few hours of freedom from deprivation, until the sunrise, when the next days fast begins.Muslims around the world observe this 1,400-year-old practice, from the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, where it originated, to Scandinavia, where the latitude has forced some scholars to issue fatwas to accommodate the Qurans prescription to fast from dawn until dusk.But no matter where they are, Muslims should be able to fast according to the dictates of their conscience. Unfortunately, some authoritarian governments violate this fundamental freedom. Some ban the Ramadan fast, while others impose it.The former problem is acute in China, especially in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, which is heavily populated by Uighurs, a Muslim people of Turkic origin. In the past few years, the Communist government there has forbidden civil servants, students and teachers to fast. The government has said it institutes the ban for health reasons and says that it faces threats from Muslim extremists. But the ban only makes Uighurs feel persecuted and alienated from their government, helping, if anything, the small strain of extremists among them who call for armed resistance.On the other side of the authoritarian coin, various Muslim governments, from Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf states to Iran and Pakistan, impose the Ramadan fast by law. Under these rules, eating or drinking in public during the holy month may mean deportation, a fine or even jail. In many other countries, even if fasting is not enforced by law it is compelled by social pressure. So people  both religious minorities and Muslims who choose not to fast  must appear as if they are fasting, even if they are not.This religious authoritarianism is senseless and self-defeating. Fasting during Ramadan is an act of worship intended for God. It is meaningful only when it is driven by a genuine will to obey Gods commandments  not the laws of the state or the vigilantism of society. The latter does not nurture true piety, it only nurtures fakeness and hypocrisy. That is why the Quran says there should be no compulsion in religion  and no compulsion in fasting, either.Moreover, according to Islamic jurisprudence, not everybody is supposed to fast. Non-Muslims are not obliged at all. Even among Muslims, the Quran exempts those who are ill, or on a journey. It even exempts those who can fast only with extreme difficulty, and tells them to feed a needy person instead. God wants ease for you, not hardship, the scripture says.Yet many Muslims choose hardship. During Ramadan last year, more than a thousand people died in Pakistan from dehydration under extreme heat, despite calls from some more flexible clerics to cease fasting. Even those who did decide to give up the fast because they were in danger still could drink water only in private because of the social pressure they faced  a big problem for people who lived on the street.Even the most rigid Muslim clerics accept that not everybody is obliged to fast during Ramadan. Yet many still support laws that ban public eating and drinking in order to respect the holy month and people who observe it. They should reconsider, though, whether they are really bringing any respect to Islam by imposing its practices. Would we Muslims feel respected if others imposed their proscriptions on us? Should Muslims in India be required to stop eating beef because it offends the sensibilities of Hindus, as a senior member of the countrys ruling Bharatiya Janata Party argued last year? Should the Uighurs respect the Chinese Communist Partys distaste for superstition, and stop practicing their faith?Respect is an admirable trait, but it cannot be imposed by law. It also should not be the basis for dictating the norms of a majority on minorities or individuals.What is the ideal Muslim approach to Ramadan? My city, Istanbul, offers a good model. Here, we have no laws governing Ramadan. Many people decide to fast, many people decide not to fast. The latter can enjoy restaurants and cafes during the day, and some perhaps even enjoy bars at night, even though Islamic law prohibits alcohol. The pious, meanwhile, fast for the right reason: They are not forced to stay thirsty and hungry by the government. They freely decide to do so out of their sincere faith in God."}
{"text": "PASADENA, Calif.  The future of computing may be in its past.The silicon transistor, the tiny switch that is the building block of modern microelectronics, replaced the vacuum tube in many consumer products in the 1970s. Now as shrinking transistors to even more Lilliputian dimensions is becoming vastly more challenging, the vacuum tube may be on the verge of a comeback.In a darkened laboratory here, two stories beneath the California Institute of Technology campus, two students stare through the walls of a thick plastic vacuum chamber at what they hope will be the next small thing  a computer chip made from circuits like vacuum tubes whose dimensions are each roughly one-thousandth the size of a red blood cell.At stake is the future of what electronic engineers call scaling, the ability to continue to shrink the size of electronic circuits, which is becoming harder to do as they become as small as viruses.It has been more than half a century since the physicist Richard Feynman predicted the rise of microelectronics, noting theres plenty of room at the bottom. He used the phrase in 1959 when he speculated about engineering with individual atoms. Several years later, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, wrote that the number of transistors that could be etched into silicon wafers would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future.Now, however, there is growing evidence that space, if still available, is increasingly at a premium. Progress is slowing down. The time between each new chip generation is stretching out, and the cost of individual transistors, although infinitesimal, is no longer falling. The tiny transistors also bedevil chip designers because as they get smaller, they generate unwanted heat.For Axel Scherer, who heads the Nanofabrication Group at Caltech, that means going back to the future. With his students Max Jones and Daniil Lukin, he is pursuing what is in effect an ultrasmall vacuum tube as a candidate to replace the transistor. In their laboratory here, they have fabricated circuits that function like vacuum tubes but are a millionth the size of that 100-year-old technology.Computer technologies seem to work in cycles, said Alan Huang, a former electrical engineer for Bell Laboratories. Some of the same algorithms that were developed for the last generation can sometimes be used for the next generation.The last time researchers explored vacuum tubes was in the 1990s, when they were a promising option for building flat-panel displays. The technology failed to take off, however, because of cheaper and more efficient liquid crystal displays.The vacuum tube comes back about every decade, Dr. Scherer said with a laugh.And for decades, that has been the story of vacuum tubes: There has always been a better option. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes because they were more compact, did not generate skin-burning heat and did not need a vacuum  the absence of atmosphere made it possible for electrons to jump between positively and negatively charged elements.The vacuum tubes the Caltech researchers are looking at are nothing like the bulky objects that hummed in the old family radio and even early computers. Both transistors and vacuum tubes  the British called the devices valves  control the flow of electricity, but they do so differently.The researchers have created a tiny tube formed from metal and capable of turning on and off the flow of electrons between four even smaller probes, which under an electron microscope appear like the tips of four ballpoint pens almost touching one another.The Achilles heel of todays transistors is the smaller they get, the more they leak electrons. In modern computer chips, as much as half of the power consumed is lost to electrons leaking from transistors that are only dozens of atoms wide. Those electrons waste energy and generate heat.In contrast, Dr. Scherers miniature vacuum tube switches perform a jujitsu move by using the same mechanism that causes leakage in transistors  known by physicists as quantum tunneling  to switch on and off the flow of electrons without leakage. As a result, he believes that modern vacuum tube circuits have the potential to use less power and work faster than todays transistor-based chips.Effects that are currently problems in scaling are precisely those that we would like to use for switching in these next-generation devices, Dr. Scherer said, noting that while there are efforts to redesign semiconductor-based transistors around the tunneling effect, his approach is significantly simpler.Vacuum tubes are one of a range of ideas that engineers are looking at as they work to create chips that can do more while using less power. Other promising approaches include exotic materials such as carbon nanotubes and even microscopic mechanical switches that can be opened and closed just like an electronic gate.The Caltech researchers returned to the idea of vacuum tubes several years ago after they had begun experimenting with the idea of making ultrasmall incandescent light bulbs no larger than a modern transistor that would be bright enough to be seen by the naked eye from across a room.The group previously worked in research areas like quantum dots, nanoscale structures now used in television displays to produce precise colors, and optoelectronics, a field that explores the use of lasers in electronic circuits. But they decided to look for new research areas that were less crowded with competitors.Today, semiconductor companies like Intel are making silicon chips with minimum dimensions between 10 and 20 nanometers. (A strand of DNA is roughly 2.5 nanometers in diameter.) Once the industry shrinks below 10 nanometers, Dr. Scherer expects that researchers will be surprised by the behavior of silicon at such atomic dimensions.For one thing, silicon emits light below 10 nanometers, he said. More significantly, it also becomes remarkably elastic as it becomes that small.Its a different material, and it gives you this different behavior, he said. He sees the future in other materials and in old ideas that would be made new again.In contrast to silicon, a semiconductor, which can either conduct or insulate, depending on how it is chemically modified, Dr. Scherers tubes can be made from a range of conducting metals, such as tungsten, molybdenum, gold and platinum. This will be an advantage because it will significantly simplify the tiny switches at the atomic scale.Dr. Scherer does not think the tiny tube will immediately replace the transistor, but the possibility of applications in space and aviation has caught the attention of Boeing, which is financing the research. Such specialty chips might be ready commercially before the end of the decade.Ten years ago, silicon transistors could meet all of our demands, he said. In the next decade, that will no longer be true."}
{"text": "DUBLIN, Ohio  The top three players in the world came into the Memorial Tournament fresh off victories. A lot of good that did them. Rory McIlroy, the worlds No. 2 golfer, backed into a tie for fourth. Top-ranked Jason Day finished tied for 27th, and Jordan Spieth was tied for 57th.The top three, who had combined for 15 top-10 finishes in 32 starts this season, were no match for William McGirt and Jon Curran, who came into the week with a combined six top-10 showings in a combined 38 starts. McGirt closed with a one-under-par 71, and Curran a 70, to finish regulation tied for the lead at 15-under 273.In the playoff, only one outcome was certain: a first-time PGA Tour winner would be crowned. With a par on the second extra hole, McGirt broke his maiden in his 165th tour start while Curran extended his winless streak to 55 tour appearances.McGirts closing round consisted of one birdie, at No. 5, and 19 pars, including the playoff. But there was nothing routine about his last par, in which he chipped from thick rough over the green to 7 feet and made the uphill putt while the tournament host, Jack Nicklaus, looked on.Its a pretty darn cool feeling right now to get win No. 1, and for it to be here at the Memorial in front of Mr. Nicklaus, McGirt said.McIlroy was the leader in the clubhouse for a good portion of the afternoon after signing for his 68 before a weather front moved in. His round included bogeys on the par-3 12th after his tee shot found the green and the par-4 14th after his drive found the fairway. Those two bogeys represented the margin separating him from McGirt. All things considered, its been a decent week, said McIlroy, who finished tied with J. B. Holmes (69), Gary Woodland (73) and Matt Kuchar (73) at 13-under 275.Blame the wind for the tumult on the Memorial Tournament leaderboard. The sweltering heat earlier in the week gave way to electrical storms over the weekend that caused weather delays totaling almost three hours. After the last of the interruptions, a 1-hour-27-minute delay on Sunday with the leaders on the back nine, the wind picked up and the players returned to what seemed a different course.The final holes were playing downwind, which brought into play fairway bunkers that Curran, making his Memorial Tournament debut, had not even noticed were there. He hit into two of them down the stretch  on the penultimate hole in regulation and on his drive at the 18th on the second playoff hole.On No. 17, he hit out to 7 feet and made the birdie to grab a share of the lead, at 15 under, with McGirt, whose final round included one birdie, at No. 5, and 19 pars, including the extra holes. Currans approach on No. 18 on the second hole of extra death sailed the green. Looking back, he said, he probably should have used his 9-iron out of the sand instead of trying to take something off an 8.Maybe I was nervous, maybe it was a little adrenaline, Curran said. I just smashed it, and it got up in the wind and took it even further left.Neither Curran nor McGirt said they felt comfortable off the tee. McGirt took advantage of the weather delay to work on his swing in the clubhouse. He described the break as huge. His career-high finish before this week, a tie for second at last falls Sanderson Farms Championship, was marked by numerous weather delays, necessitating a Monday finish.Nicklaus, a 73-time tour winner, praised the play of McGirt and Curran down the stretch. A lot of guys had an opportunity to win this golf tournament today, he said, adding, The guys kept self-destructing. And the only two guys who didnt self-destruct were Will and Jon. They both came right down the stretch, both playing well, and thats what we ended up with.Curran was standing off to the side of the green, staring into the distance as if he were trying to make sense of what had just happened, when Nicklaus came up to him and tapped him on the right shoulder and patted him on the stomach. He congratulated him on his fine play and told him he was going to win many tournaments, an exchange that Curran described as pretty cool.As was made plain Sunday, sometimes the winner is the one who plods along and lets everyone else self-destruct. I won half of my golf tournaments watching everyone else self-destruct, he said as a wide-eyed McGirt hung on Nicklauss every word."}
{"text": "TUESDAY PUZZLE  When is a crossword puzzle not just a crossword puzzle?Answer: When its also a NEEDLEPOINT sampler.Peter A. Collins is back today and apparently, hes got a new hobby. Thats great, because its a rare opportunity for beginning-of-the-week solvers to see what having fun with the grid can do. Lets join him and get stitching.Were you able to guess that some of the circled squares made a HOME? Of course, there are a lot of kinds of HOMEs, but todays charming theme represents a NEEDLEPOINT sampler of a THREE STORY HOUSE with a SLATE ROOF. Above that, at 17-,18- and 19A, is the requisite HOME SWEET HOME.I really wanted this to be a cross-stitch sampler (which happens to have the same number of letters as NEEDLEPOINT), because Ive seen more of those. I also had a bit of trouble getting started with the triple revealer across the top, because the only lyrics to the Civil War era song that I know are the Be it ever so humble  part. Perhaps we should know more about this song because, when it was played on the battlefield, weapons were laid down and, for a moment, the Union and Confederate armies were not enemies. Here are the lyrics according to Historynet.com:Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,\nBe it ever so humble theres no place like home!\nA charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,\nWhich, seek through the world, is neer met with\nelsewhere:\nHome! Home! sweet, sweet Home!\nTheres no place like Home!\nTheres no place like Home.Of course, if youre not the sentimental type, there is always the Motley Crue version:Mr. Collins set himself a tough task by arranging his theme material the way he did, but he still managed to get some very worthy 15-letter Downs in, in the form of DAMON AND PYTHIAS and STOP THE BLEEDING, which makes its debut. I also liked seeing DEFIB, PIATA and CEDILLA.Patton OSWALT makes his surname debut today and, as noted below, has been in The New York Times Crossword before under his full name. I would venture that Mr. OSWALT is a household name, as he is not only a well-known and outspoken comedian, but he tragically lost his wife, the true-crime writer Michelle McNamara, recently and it was very much in the news. Perhaps the back-and-forth Mr. Collins alludes to in his notes was meant to signify that Mr. OSWALT might not be as recognizable using just his surname.Also, FREE P.R. is a well-known redundancy and is most likely a leak from yesterdays REDUNDANT puzzle theme by Mary Lou Guizzo. We apologize for the leak and have set an emu to work plugging it.There were quite a few tricky clues for your average Tuesday puzzle, but were ready for it, arent we? Tough entry in the northwest today if you dont know your bacteria shapes and your German valleys. The shape of bacilli bacteria (1A) is RODS and the German valley at 1D is the RUHR. And right below that, how are you supposed to know an electoral statistic like that, am I right? No fear. Youve already got RUHR, so youve got the U in the first square and how many four letter states are there that start with the letter U? Only one, and thats UTAH. See? Even unfair clues can be gotten. Know Your Crossword Waterways alert! One of the rivers leading to the Rhne is the ISERE. 38As clue, Faade feature? is tricky. On the surface, you might think that Mr. Collins is asking for a feature of the faade itself, but thats not where were going today. The feature were looking for is a feature of the word faade, and that would be the CEDILLA on the letter C. 40As clue Small flycatchers? Birds. No, Im not kidding. 54As Q*___ is the one and only Q*BERT. Im so glad I played video games in the 1980s. DAMON AND PYTHIAS is a legend highlighting the Pythagorean ideal of true friendship. I dont know about you, but I am very proud of the fact that I remembered how to spell SHERE Hites name. Maybe you need to be a child of the 60s or 70s to truly appreciate this one, but for my money, MEECEs is a perfectly cromulent word: 26Ds Looking at it a different way, in texts is OTOH, which stands for On The Other Hand.This one went through six iterations before it was ready for prime time.  The editors even asked me to consider ripping out my NEEDLEPOINT.  It certainly constrains the fill near the apex of the SLATE ROOF.  I begged and pleaded, and eventually Will and Joel allowed NEEDLEPOINT to stay.  In order to keep SWEET, NEEDLEPOINT, and the angled SLATE ROOF down the center column, I had to fill ??W?LT and ??E?PR.For the first one, the solution I came up with was Patton OSWALT  perhaps not a household name in a lot of households.  Joel and I had to twist Wills arm to get OSWALT to stay  and just for the record, we twisted his left arm so as not to impede his table tennis career.  [The comedians full name, PATTON OSWALT, actually made a New York Times debut in a 2012 puzzle by Caleb Madison. D.A.]For the second, I needed to pull FREE P.R. out of thin air.  I was quite proud of that entry until Byron Walden stole some of my thunder.  He introduced BAD P.R. while my puzzle sat in the queue. Is there a grumbly-faced, fist-shaking emoticon?  If so, insert one here.Over all, I hope the grid has a COMFY, NEEDLEPOINT vibe to it (IDI AMIN notwithstanding).Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  As news outlets round the world continued to publish revelations from the Panama Papers, the nonprofit organization that coordinated the project was preparing to move out of its offices here in an effort to cut costs.The organization, called the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was already forced to part with three contract journalists who had helped its small staff shepherd the project. And three other budgeted positions, it was told, would have to be left unfilled for now.Its brief shining moment in the journalistic spotlight was being complicated by much more familiar issues. Like so many of its peers in nonprofit journalism, the consortium is subject to the financial headwinds buffeting the industry as a whole. In this case, it is feeling ripple effects from the financial struggles of its parent organization, the Center for Public Integrity, the venerable nonprofit investigative news organization that controls the consortiums budget.The financial pinch has created dual realities for the consortium, damping morale and escalating long-simmering tensions with its parent, even as the impact of the Panama Papers has dramatically increased its global profile.The consortiums problems also represent a potential setback in the search for new ways to finance and pursue journalism at a time when traditional news organizations, and even new digital operations, are seeking workable business models. In the nonprofit segment of the industry, which has inspired hope as a way forward, it has exposed a particularly hard truth: Financing even the most successful investigative reporting unit is hard and often inconsistent.You always want more staff and more funding, the consortiums director, Gerard Ryle, said. But I have to accept the situation as it is. My job is to get on with things no matter what.Financial uneasiness is nothing new for the Center for Public Integrity, which ran yearly operating deficits from 2005 to 2007, and again in 2011.Peter Bale, who took over the organization last year after a stint at CNN International, said the organization was still trying to recover from that legacy  including a $2.1 million deficit in unrestricted net assets that he said he had inherited from his predecessor, whose editorial gambles have drawn criticism. That deficit, which the board has said cannot grow, has forced him to make cuts, Mr. Bale said, while honoring funding agreements and the centers editorial imperatives.But Bill Buzenberg, who led the center from 2007 to 2015, disputed that assessment, saying that a deficit in general support is not unusual for nonprofits. It becomes a problem, he said, when annual fund-raising from specific programs and objectives declines.I kept telling them, you have to raise money like crazy this year for next, Mr. Buzenberg said. Im not sure that happened.The center is expected to raise $9.3 million this year, down from around $11 million last year, Mr. Bale said, noting that grants to the center are often paid out over multiple years.He has had to consider cuts anywhere he can find them, not just at the consortium. The Center for Public Integrity laid off two prizewinning senior investigative reporters of its own in May and is delaying hiring for open positions.The financial woes have strained the relationship between two organizations that David E. Kaplan, who ran the consortium from 2008 to 2011, says have always been awkward partners. The consortium was founded in 1997 as a branch of the center to focus on international investigations, but it quickly developed its own ethos.These are two different organizations in culture, structure and methodology, said Mr. Kaplan, who resigned in protest in 2011 during a period of particular tension between the groups.The differences have only intensified as the consortium has grown under Mr. Ryle, an Irish-born investigative journalist who worked in Australia before taking the position. Its budget has roughly tripled, to almost $2 million this year, and its staff has grown threefold, to about a dozen, including contractors, after the cuts.It has also deliberately moved away from the journalistic model of its parent organization, in search of a more effective way to investigate and distribute stories across borders at a relatively low cost.The model, in which the consortium coordinates teams of reporters around the world to work collaboratively on a single big source base, has been increasingly successful, aiding in investigations of international interest, like Lux Leaks, which in 2014 exposed how Luxembourg had helped hundreds of international companies cut their taxes through preferential deals, and Swiss Leaks, which a year later exposed how HSBC helped the rich evade taxes.With the Panama Papers, the consortium assembled its largest team to date, carefully coordinating with almost 400 journalists from 70 countries to pore over a single enormous leak of documents. Using research tools developed by the consortium, the team exposed a vast network of offshore banks and shell companies used by the worlds powerful and rich to hide their wealth.Their findings have prompted investigations in dozens of countries, forced political ousters  including the prime minister of Iceland  and inspired policy debates around the world.The Panama Papers also brought a new level of renown to the consortium. And it prompted peers and supporters to wonder whether the organization could provide a model for a segment of the journalism industry particularly hard hit by shrinking budgets and other market forces.Given the need to operate within the budgets we have, I.C.I.J. has done an astounding job, Mr. Bale said of the consortium, adding that he hoped the Center for Public Integrity could incorporate some of its techniques.Mr. Bale acknowledged that tensions between the two groups had increased and might fan the desire by some at the consortium to spin off into a separate organization. That, he said, would be a mistake; the centers board opposes such a move.Fund-raising could help, and both Mr. Bale and Mr. Ryle said they hoped the consortiums increased profile would attract support to help stabilize the centers overall finances.But for now, the cutbacks at the consortium are particularly painful. The group has spent much of the last two weeks moving up five floors from its own offices into the centers. And though Mr. Ryle said he hoped to be able to hire back some of the contractors he had let go, for now, he said, he would have to make do with less.It gives you an enormous amount of freedom in the journalism, Mr. Ryle said of the nonprofit model, but you have to accept that there is a cost sometimes on the other side.For Ryan Chittum, one of the three contractors who left last month after more than a year working on the Panama Papers, the timing is as frustrating as it is ironic.Theres still a lot to do on that story  its just kind of an unfortunate commentary on the fragility of journalism, Mr. Chittum said. Its not like I make huge dollars, but we dont have money to do it right now."}
{"text": "BERLIN  You know times have changed when the Germans announce they are expanding their army for the first time in 25 years  and no one objects.Back when the Berlin Wall fell, Britain and France in particular feared the re-emergence of a German colossus in Europe. By contrast, Berlins pledge last month to add almost 7,000 soldiers to its military by 2023, and an earlier announcement to spend up to 130 billion euros, about $148 billion, on new equipment by 2030 were warmly welcomed by NATO allies.It has taken decades since the horrors of World War II, but Berlins modern-day allies and, it seems, German leaders themselves are finally growing more comfortable with the notion that Germanys role as the European Unions de facto leader requires a military dimension.Perhaps none too soon. The United States and others  including many of Germanys own defense experts  want Germany to do even more for Continental security and to broaden deployments overseas.President Obama expressed frustration in an interview this year that the United States European and Persian Gulf allies were acting too often as free riders. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been even more scathing in his remarks, threatening to pull out of NATO if he is elected.As a July NATO summit meeting in Warsaw approaches, Germany, Europes largest economy, is now key to how the alliance will face the twin perils that have transformed the strategic situation in Europe: a more menacing Russia and the Islamic States expansion beyond individual acts of terrorism like executions to seizing territory.In Europe, where NATOs easternmost members, particularly Poland and the Baltic States, have clamored for permanent deployment of Allied troops to deter Russian meddling, Germany looks set to take command of a brigade in Lithuania, joining Britain and the United States in leading the effort to marshal a robust presence on Russias borders.Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany is also playing a part in NATO programs to pool resources of member states for greater collective security. Defense experts hold up increased German-Dutch cooperation as a model.The path to even a semblance of collective European defense is littered with unmet promises of better cooperation  for example, the quarter-century-old Franco-German brigade, which remains mostly a paper tiger, and the scramble ahead of the Warsaw meeting to find a fourth country to command a unit in the new NATO deployment in Eastern Europe. Britain and France, both nuclear powers, continue to set their own priorities.But whether on its own or with others, Germany is showing signs of growing more comfortable with embracing a bigger military role, a gradual but distinct shift away from an instinctive pacifism that took hold starting in 1945, and a post-Cold War tendency to shrink the nations military.The shift started becoming publicly apparent in 2014, when Germanys president and foreign and defense ministers all urged an increased global security role for the country at the annual Munich Security Conference. Weeks later, Russias leader, President Vladimir V. Putin, annexed Crimea from Ukraine.Since then, Germany has responded by helping to build a NATO rapid response force in Eastern Europe, leading the diplomacy efforts in Ukraine, and training and arming Kurdish pesh merga battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Now, a new government strategy document, the first such White Book in 10 years, is being prepared. It is likely both to bolster Germanys role on the world stage  beyond its traditional sphere of activity in Europe  and to talk explicitly of military contributions.How far this thinking has spread outside the political and military elite is open to question. Polling shows that the general public is not very comfortable with the military dimension, said Sylke Tempel, the editor of International Policy, the magazine of the German Council on Foreign Relations.The policy-making elite, on other hand, know that strategic thinking includes the notion that you have to build a force in order to be taken seriously, and that you have to spend on this dimension, Ms. Tempel said.Germany is not moving fast enough for defense experts like Hans-Peter Bartels, the parliamentary commissioner for the military, or Karl-Heinz Kamp, the president of the governments Federal Academy for Security Policy.Germany should expand its military as quickly as possible, as much as possible, said Dr. Bartels, a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party. Despite the announced expansion, he noted, military spending is in danger of sinking to 1.08 percent of Germanys gross domestic product, which he said would be its lowest ever  and well below the 2 percent that NATO member states committed to spend at the alliances last summit meeting, in Wales in 2014.Dr. Kamp was more upbeat about German and NATO efforts, particularly the plans for meeting any Russian challenge on the alliances eastern borders.We are almost at permanent presence, almost, Dr. Kamp said. More is being decided than Putin could ever have imagined.The major danger he sees for these plans is the fact that we have these anti-establishment movements on both sides of the Atlantic  we have the Alternative for Germany, we have the National Front in France and in the U.S.A. we have Trump.Populists in such movements have little interest in knitting together trans-Atlantic interests and deploying Allied forces for common goals, he said.These anti-establishment movements stand in contrast to everything which is NATO, and that is the only point which really worries me, Dr. Kamp said.In German politics, the post of defense minister has traditionally proved difficult. The job is prestigious, but plagued by difficulties in securing finances and suitable, modern equipment.Neither the defense minister nor the chancellor is commander in chief of the army  another legacy of post-Nazi efforts to constrain Germany. Control of the army belongs to the Parliament, and any military expense or deployment is subject to its approval.Further, demographic decline and the lure of good civilian jobs in Germanys robust economy have made it difficult to recruit an all-volunteer force.Thomas Wiegold, an expert on defense affairs, noted that regular troop strength  around 166,000 in April  already lags the current target of 170,000 and asked whether the defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, could reach that level and then keep her pledge of more soldiers by 2023.The political message is that after decades of shrinking, we want to grow, Mr. Wiegold said. But how that translates practically, nobody yet knows.The defense minister has taken several steps to make the military a better employer. They include hiring a senior aide from the business consultant McKinsey to examine structures, and simply ensuring more contact between soldiers overseas and their families back home.A new cyberwarfare unit is a priority. The Defense Ministry is trying to end equipment failures and malfunctions. Last year, a dispute erupted with the arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch over the standard issue G-36 machine gun, which the ministry said did not always fire straight.Another major task is to convince skeptical Germans, particularly in the east, that NATO is keeping its 1997 bargain with Russia that alliance troops would not be stationed permanently at Russias edge.And so, in another measure of how things have changed in Europe, listeners of a Berlin broadcaster, rbb Inforadio, heard an unusual early morning interview on May 19. On the line from the Polish port city of Szczecin was Lt. Gen. Manfred Hofmann, a 42-year veteran of the German Army, who commands a corps that began in 1999 as a German-Danish unit to help Poland integrate into NATO, which it joined that spring.Dialogue with Moscow has not shut down, he said, and NATO is keeping its commitments not to permanently station combat units on former Soviet bloc territory.But the general noted that the corps command is now a 400-person, 21-nation unit, overseeing rapid deployment of NATO units if necessary, and reflected that since the 2014 summit meeting in Wales, an unbelievable amount has happened."}
{"text": "MIAMI  It was a classic pitchers duel from start to finish on Sunday afternoon, and while Matt Harvey came out on the wrong end of a 1-0 score against the Miami Marlins Jose Fernandez, he still had a good deal to feel positive about.Harvey matched the fiery Fernandez for seven solid innings in what was his second straight strong start in a season that, until now, had been full of struggles. He allowed just one earned run and four hits, with three strikeouts and no walks, almost duplicating the seven shutout innings he threw against the Chicago White Sox last Monday, on Memorial Day.Its still two starts; and obviously, the massive struggles that happened before, the only thing you want to think of is not letting that kind of creep back in, said Harvey, who is an unbecoming 4-8 on the season but no doubt in a better frame of mind than he was a week ago.Or, as he put it to reporters after the game, Feeling pretty good is definitely a positive.It was Harveys bad luck that Fernandez was just a little bit sharper on Sunday, matching his career high with 14 strikeouts over seven innings and allowing just four hits on 100 pitches, 73 of which were strikes. Harvey was almost as precise, with 70 strikes across 104 pitches.Fernandez improved to 9-2 this season and is on a roll. Harvey has definitely not been, but he still has much of the season to truly turn things around.Fernandez and Harvey made for an intriguing matchup. They share the same agent in the formidable Scott Boras and have had a similar career arc  right-handers who displayed dominance early on, only to succumb to injury and have to work their way back after Tommy John surgery.Harveys only real mistake Sunday came in the bottom of the fifth, when he left a pitch up in the strike zone that Miamis Derek Dietrich smacked for a double off the fence in center field. Marlins catcher J. T. Realmuto then drove in Dietrich with a single up the middle on a 2-0 pitch, giving Fernandez all the support he needed.You dont want to give up a run in a tight ballgame like that, Harvey said. But I left a pitch over the plate and he got on second and then I made a pretty good pitch to Realmuto and he hit it up the middle. In that situation I wanted a ground ball, I got it, it just wasnt at somebody.Mets Manager Terry Collins was enthused by Harveys performance, and why not?I think he threw the ball great, and I thought he really pitched today, Collins said. He moved the ball around, you saw him pitch inside and he made very, very few mistakes. The ball up to Dietrichs probably the only mistake he made, so I thought he threw the ball great.Collins added: I think its going to ease Matts mind most of all, and thats the one that counts. He felt good about what he did today, how he got through it.Rivera, who has been behind the plate for each of Harveys last two starts, seemed similarly pleased. If you ask the other side how Harvey threw theyd tell you the same thing  that he was good, he was nasty and thats how the 1-0 games go, he said.When Fernandez made his debut as a rookie in 2013 and took the National League by storm, Harvey was having a Cy Young Award-worthy season himself before tearing an elbow ligament that August. He missed all of 2014 and then more or less returned to form in 2015, going 13-8 with a 2.71 E.R.A. and 188 strikeouts in helping the Mets reach the postseason.But that was also when Boras pointedly expressed concern about how many innings Harvey was pitching in his first season back from surgery.In the end, Harvey did keep pitching, throwing 26 innings in the postseason, including eight-plus innings in the final game of the World Series, against the Kansas City Royals.How much that heavy workload has been responsible for his rocky start this season is up for debate, but in any case he now appears to be finding his form.Even though he is pitching much better now, there were times, Harvey said after Sundays game, where I kind of leak to the plate and my arm doesnt get out.But over all, he added, when you can go seven and limit damage and give your team a chance to win its pretty satisfying. The Mets agree, even if they lost.INSIDE PITCHMets outfielder Juan Lagares sustained a sprained left thumb in his teams 6-4 victory Saturday while making a diving catch in center field. With the Mets headed to Pittsburgh to begin a three-game series on Monday, Lagares will continue on to New York for further evaluation and tests.They just told me Ive got a sprain and Ive got to get it checked out tomorrow, Lagares said after the game on Sunday. Today it just felt like last night  a little swelling but no pain."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump, who said last week that a judges Mexican heritage should disqualify him from a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, expressed doubt on Sunday that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case, comments that are unlikely to ease concerns among his fellow Republicans who fear his controversial remarks could hurt the party in November.Mr. Trumps comments, made in an interview with John Dickerson, the host of CBSs Face the Nation, followed his criticism of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, a federal judge in California overseeing a suit against the defunct Trump University. Mr. Trump said Judge Curiel had a conflict of interest in the case because of Mr. Trumps proposed border wall with Mexico.Republicans, concerned about how his contentious statements could harm their ability to retain control of the Senate and have a detrimental effect in down-ballot races, have struggled with how to distance themselves from Mr. Trumps language without alienating his die-hard voters.In a series of interviews on Sunday television news shows, Republicans repudiated Mr. Trumps comments about Judge Curiel. But instead of softening his stance, Mr. Trump intensified it.Mr. Dickerson asked Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, if a Muslim judge would be similarly biased because of Mr. Trumps call for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Its possible, yes, Mr. Trump said. Yeah. That would be possible. Absolutely.When Mr. Dickerson said there was a tradition in the United States, a nation of immigrants, against judging people based on heritage, Mr. Trump replied, Im not talking about tradition, Im talking about common sense, O.K.?In his interview with Mr. Dickerson, and in a separate discussion with Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union, Mr. Trump refused to retreat from his comments on Judge Curiels background.He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine, Mr. Trump said. But I say hes got bias. I want to build a wall. Im going to build a wall. Im doing very well with the Latinos, with the Hispanics, with the Mexicans, Im doing very well with them, in my opinion.Judge Curiel, 62, was born in East Chicago, Ind., to parents who had emigrated from Mexico. He graduated from Indiana Universitys law school and worked as an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of California before being appointed in 2007 to the bench in San Diego by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. President Obama nominated Judge Curiel to the federal bench in late 2011, and he was confirmed by the Senate in 2012.Mr. Trumps broadside against Judge Curiel was one of the most overtly racial remarks he had made in the presidential race, and it exacerbated the tension between some Republicans and their nominee. White, older, working-class voters make up a large portion of the partys base, and Republicans need to keep the presidential campaign close in order to hold their majority in the Senate. But Mr. Trumps remarks have offended wide blocs of voters to whom the party must appeal amid national demographic shifts.And the critiques have raised concerns about how, as president, Mr. Trump would handle the separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of government. That issue is sacred to conservatives, who have railed against what they see as an abuse of power by Mr. Obama.Republicans have tried to mitigate the potential damage of Mr. Trumps language by rejecting it in one moment, but embracing his candidacy in the next.On NBCs Meet the Press, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, did not directly answer a question about whether Mr. Trumps remark had been racist, but said he completely disagreed with it. All of us came here from somewhere else, Mr. McConnell said, referring to Judge Curiels heritage. Thats an important part of what makes America work.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican whose name had been floated as a potential vice-presidential nominee, said on ABCs This Week of Mr. Trumps behavior, I think that hes going to have to change. And Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who has been among Mr. Trumps most vocal supporters, called the Curiel remarks inexcusable on Fox News Sunday.This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made, said Mr. Gingrich, who has also been mentioned as a potential vice-presidential candidate.But none of the three men rejected Mr. Trumps candidacy outright. Mr. Gingrich praised Mr. Trump moments later as a quick learner. Mr. Corker suggested that Mr. Trump has an opportunity to really change the trajectory of our country, and its my sense that he will take advantage of that.Those defenses are becoming more strained as Mr. Trump has reversed his suggestions that he knows he must grow into the role of nominee. And Republicans were mostly silent after Hillary Clinton assailed Mr. Trump in a speech on Thursday about the stakes of the election. Mr. Trump led his defense on Twitter and at a rally, but his campaign and its surrogates had no uniform response.In the weeks since he vanquished his remaining two primary opponents, Mr. Trump has repeatedly turned his campaigns focus inward  toward his businesses, the Trump University lawsuit, his fights with other Republicans  and obscured the hopes Republicans had of keeping a spotlight on Mrs. Clinton and her email controversy, or on a jobs report suggesting a slowdown in job creation.Mr. McConnell, who endorsed Mr. Trump quickly after Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee early last month, has been vocal in his concern that the remarks on Hispanics will have a historic effect along the lines of the remarks Barry Goldwater made on the partys ability to woo black voters after he declined to support the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Mr. McConnell said the alternative to Mr. Trump  a second Clinton presidency  was worse. But he also urged Mr. Trump to stop focusing on the recent past and to look toward the future.This is a good time, it seems to me, to begin to try to unify the party, Mr. McConnell said.And you unify the party by not settling scores and grudges against people youve been competing with, he added. Were all behind him now. And Id like to see him reach out and pull us all together and give us a real shot at winning this November."}
{"text": "DHAKA, Bangladesh  Three attackers fatally shot and stabbed the wife of a police superintendent in southern Bangladesh on Sunday morning, the police said, the latest in a series of killings in which Islamist militants are the primary suspects.The woman, Mahmuda Khanam Mitu, 30, and her young son were walking through a narrow lane near their home in Chittagong on the way to a school bus stop when three men arriving on a motorcycle stabbed her and shot her in the head, said Mohiuddin Mahmood, the officer in charge of the Panchlaish police station in Chittagong. The son was unhurt.We found nine wounds of stabbing on her back and belly, Mr. Mahmood said.Her husband, Babul Akter, a police officer with a record of going after Islamist militants, was recently promoted to superintendent. In December, Superintendent Akter led a raid on an apartment on the outskirts of the city that the police said belonged to the banned group Jamaat-ul-Mujahedeen Bangladesh, according to the local news media.In October, five people suspected of belonging to the militant group were  arrested in Chittagong.We suspect militants, Iqbal Bahar, the commissioner of the Chittagong Metropolitan Police, said of the attack. Superintendent Akters work created threats for him.Superintendent Akter had been in Dhaka, the capital, for the past few days after his promotion, the police said.Though Commissioner Bahar said it was not yet clear who had carried out the attack, he said Jamaat-ul-Mujahedeen Bangladesh could have been involved.For the past two years, activists, religious minorities, intellectuals and secularist writers, among others, have been targeted for death in Bangladesh, and the deaths appear to have accelerated in recent weeks.The Islamic State has claimed some of the killings on social media accounts linked to it, and others have been claimed by a faction of Al Qaeda. The authorities in Bangladesh have denied the presence of foreign militants in the country.Also on Sunday, a Christian man, Sunil Gomez, 60, was hacked to death in his grocery store in the Natore district in northern Bangladesh, in a style similar to recent attacks, said Moniruzzaman, subinspector of the Boraigram police station in Natore, who goes by one name.The Amaq News Agency of the Islamic State claimed the killing, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. But Mr. Moniruzzaman said it was too soon to name suspects."}
{"text": "Your smartphone allows you to get almost instantaneous answers to the most obscure questions. It also allows you to waste hours scrolling through Facebook or looking for the latest deals on Amazon.More powerful computing systems can predict the weather better than any meteorologist or beat human champions in complex board games like chess.But for several years, economists have asked why all that technical wizardry seems to be having so little impact on the economy. The issue surfaced again recently, when the government reported disappointingly slow growth and continuing stagnation in productivity. The rate of productivity growth from 2011 to 2015 was the slowest since the five-year period ending in 1982.One place to look at this disconnect is in the doctors office. Dr. Peter Sutherland, a family physician in Tennessee, made the shift to computerized patient records from paper in the last few years. There are benefits to using electronic health records, Dr. Sutherland says, but grappling with the software and new reporting requirements has slowed him down. He sees fewer patients, and his income has slipped.Im working harder and getting a little less, he said.The productivity puzzle has given rise to a number of explanations in recent years  and divided economists into technology pessimists and optimists.The most prominent pessimist is Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. His latest entry in the debate is his new book, The Rise and Fall of American Growth. Mr. Gordon contends that the current crop of digital innovations does not yield the big economic gains of breakthrough inventions of the past, like electricity, cars, planes and antibiotics.The optimists are led by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, co-directors of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. They argue that there have always been lags between when technology arrives and when people and institutions learn to use it effectively. That has been true for a range of technologies, including the electric motor and the internet, which contributed to the last stretch of healthy productivity growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s.The gains from current tech trends like big-data analysis, artificial intelligence and robotics, they say, will come. Just wait.Some economists insist the problem is largely a measurement gap, because many digital goods and services are not accurately captured in official statistics. But a recent study by two economists from the Federal Reserve and one from the International Monetary Fund casts doubt on that theory.Technology spending has been robust, rising 54 percent over a decade to $727 billion last year, according to the research firm IDC. Despite all the smartphone sales to consumers, most of the spending is by companies investing in technology to increase growth and productivity.But an industry-by-industry analysis, published by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, found that the march of digital technology across the economy has a long way to go. The McKinsey researchers examined 22 industries, measuring not only investment but also the use of technology to change how work is done. Some industries, like technology, media and financial services, were well along, while others, like health care and hospitality, trailed.Only 18 percent of the American economy is living up to its digital potential, the report concluded. And if lagging industries do not catch up, we will not see much of a change in national economic statistics, said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute.Since the financial crisis, the Obama administration has moved aggressively to push medicine into the digital age. As part of the economic recovery package, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. The legislation provided for federal incentive payments of $44,000 a physician to shift to electronic health records.The billions of dollars in subsidies were intended to accelerate adoption. And from 2008 to 2014, the share of hospitals with electronic health records rose to 75 percent from 9 percent, while the adoption rate in doctors offices rose to 51 percent from 17 percent, according to the most recent surveys by the American Hospital Association and the government.The government funding has made a huge difference, said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. But were seeing little evidence so far that all this technology has had much effect on quality and costs.The electronic records, health experts say, represent only a first step toward curbing costs and improving care. People confuse information automation with creating the kind of work environment where productivity and creativity can flourish, said Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national health technology coordinator in the George W. Bush administration. And so little has gone into changing work so far.The government incentives came with timetables for adopting different levels of use and new reporting requirements, with the prospect of financial penalties for doctors and hospitals that fell behind. The early goals for adopting electronic records were reasonable, health experts say, but the later stages were too aggressive.Overwhelmed doctors protested, and the administration recently shelved the previous timetable, stretching out schedules and modifying some reporting rules.Healthstar Physicians, the 50-doctor group in Morristown, Tenn., where Dr. Sutherland practices, was spurred to go electronic by those federal incentive payments, which now total $32 billion. But the cultural adjustment to digital technology has been challenging.Dr. Sutherland and his colleagues evaluated several technology providers and chose Athenahealth, which does not sell software but is paid a percentage of its customers revenue. Healthstar started using Athenahealths cloud software in 2012, first for billing and then for electronic health records. Athenahealths share is less than 5 percent of the groups revenue.Today, Dr. Sutherlands personal income and the medical groups revenue are about 8 percent below where they were four years ago. But in 2015, both his earnings and the revenue of Healthstar, which employs 350 people in 10 clinics, increased slightly, by nearly 3 percent from 2014.Dr. Sutherland decided he did not want a computer screen separating him from his patients. So he opted for a tablet computer, making it easier to keep eye contact.Not a fast typist, Dr. Sutherland decided to use voice recognition software. For six months, he stayed up until midnight most nights, training the software until its speech recognition engine could transcribe his comments into text with few mistakes.Dr. Sutherland bemoans the countless data fields he must fill in to comply with government-mandated reporting rules, and he concedes that some of his colleagues hate using digital records.Yet Dr. Sutherland is no hater. Despite the extra work the new technology has created and even though it has not yet had the expected financial payoff, he thinks it has helped him provide better information to patients.He values being able to tap the screen to look up potentially harmful drug interactions and to teach patients during visits. He can, for example, quickly create charts to show diabetes patients how they are progressing with treatment plans, managing blood glucose levels and weight loss.He is working harder, Dr. Sutherland says, but he believes he is a better doctor. Blunt measures of productivity, he added, arent everything. My patients are better served, he said. And Im happier."}
{"text": "Lasers dont go far enough.Over Memorial Day Weekend, the Mets general manager Sandy Alderson complained that the Dodgers were using a laser range-finder to measure exactly where their outfielders should stand at Citi Field.Thats on top of the radar, cameras and software that teams were already using to calculate where abatter is likely to send the ball and place fielders accordingly. Americas once-stodgy national pastime is modernizing at a rapid clip.Why are the Mets standing in the way of progress? After all, with just few more technological improvements, fans could enjoy a smoother, higher-quality baseball experience, free from the irregularities that make the game so frustratingly unpredictable today. Here are some options the league should consider if it truly wants to move the game closer to its Platonic ideal:IntelliBallThis ball comes equipped with a system of sensors and motors to ensure that it always arrives within the strike zone, no matter how wildly the pitcher throws it. A simple control panel allows the pitcher to select froma variety of pitches, such as the sinker, the curveball or the meteor, which proceeds directly upward from the glove into the ionosphere before plummeting into the strike zone at nine million miles per hour. As a fail-safe, if the ball detects that the batter is about to make contact, it uses projectile technology to make the bat explode.IntelliBall Plus, with fielding assistanceAn upgrade to the IntelliBall, this model contains a chip that communicates with corresponding chips embedded in players brains. The player mentally selects where the ball will go and it travels automatically to its destination, no throwing required. An error can occur only if a players mind wanders. Warning: This also means the ball could collide with the face of a rival or particularly irksome teammate or just roll aimlessly around the infield when players suffer from ennui.AutoGloveTiny cameras nestled inside the stitching of this state-of-the-art wearable technology track the arc of each ball, and built-in motors position the glove for a perfect catch every time. All the player has to do is resist his natural temptation to steer the glove himself. In fact, the glove works best without a player attached to it, raising the intriguing possibility of an infield and outfield composed entirely of gloves. Early focus groups describing the idea as creepy should not be a barrier to experimentation in this area.Virtual BaseballInstead of putting human players through the tiring ritual of playing a physical game, an algorithm determines the winner based on past performance, weather conditions and the position of Saturn. The entire process takes nine milliseconds, with a break after 6.5 milliseconds for fans to sing Take Me Out to the Ball Game and get snacks.Absolute ZeroThe Virtual Baseball algorithm still subjects fans to the stress of waiting several milliseconds to find out who won. So why not go all the way a season with no games at all? Fans of high-scoring games may be put off by this minimalist approach, but those who appreciate great defense will be thrilled, since no one will ever get on base. In keeping with the theme of absence, fans will be asked to avoid ballparks, which will be turned into monuments to the bygone, inferior era in which baseball was actually played. Ticket prices, however, will remain the same."}
{"text": "In his latest swipe at Mayor Bill de Blasio, the State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, introduced a bill on Friday that would extend mayoral control of New York City schools by only one year, while allowing the governor to appoint an education inspector with substantial power to interfere in the management of the schools.The bill prompted swift criticism from both Democratic members of the Assembly and the Partnership for New York City, a business group, which warned that it would return the schools to a chaotic and dysfunctional form of governance.Mr. Flanagan, a Republican, has in recent weeks made something of a sport of tormenting  Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, as the mayor seeks a renewal of mayoral control, which otherwise will lapse on June 30. He has questioned Mr. de Blasios knowledge of the schools, accused him of not being forthcoming with information, and expressed indignation when the mayor, after testifying for nearly four hours at one Senate hearing, did not attend a second one.Mr. de Blasios predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was the first mayor to win control of the citys schools, which he did in 2002. The Legislature granted him seven years, with strong support from the Senates Republican majority, and then a six-year renewal in 2009. But Mr. de Blasio made an enemy of Mr. Flanagan in his first year in office, when he tried to help the Democrats win a majority in the Senate. As a result, last year, when Mr. de Blasio asked for permanent control, he got only a one-year renewal.This year, Mr. de Blasio asked for seven years, then requested three years, after the Democratic majority in the Assembly approved a three-year extension.Mr. Flanagans bill would create a position of education inspector, to be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Among the inspectors powers, he or she would have access to all the districts records, documents and information systems. The mayor and the citys Education Department would have to fully cooperate with all of the inspectors requests for information. The inspector could appeal decisions by the citys Panel for Educational Policy, which approves contracts and decisions to locate charter schools in public school buildings, among other things, to the state education commissioner. The inspector could void any contracts or appointments to the panel if he or she finds a conflict of interest.On Saturday, the two other parties in the state government said they did not support the education inspector provision. Michael Whyland, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Democrat, said Democratic lawmakers supported a straight extension of mayoral control, without conditions. And a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, with whom the mayor has been openly feuding, said the governor supported a three-year extension and nothing else."}
{"text": "Mike Breen has sneaked up on us  if stealth is possible when youve called Knicks games on radio and TV for a quarter-century and been the lead voice of the N.B.A. on ESPN and ABC for a decade.Breens longevity is not a surprise. He is an easy, comfortable presence whose play-by-play is smooth and accurate, who pays attention to small details and engages his analysts  Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy at ESPN and ABC, and Walt Frazier at MSG Network  as if they are carrying on a game-long discussion. He has no shtick  unless you count Bang! for critical 3-pointers as one.The N.B.A. finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers is his record 11th finals, two more than Marv Albert (with NBC) and Dick Stockton (CBS). And he will continue his run with a newly announced contract extension.I know this sounds corny and clichd, but its kind of overwhelming to think about it, he said by telephone Friday between Games 1 and 2 of the finals. I grew up watching the N.B.A. when Marv was the man  and hes still the man  and I listened to Stockton call all those Lakers-Celtics matchups. Ive been blessed to have all these opportunities come my way.Breen might have been calling his 14th N.B.A. finals if ESPN/ABC had chosen its lead announcer more wisely when it took over N.B.A. broadcast rights from NBC after the 2002 season. ESPN picked Brad Nessler, best known for his bland college football and basketball work, but he flopped. With David Stern, then the N.B.A. commissioner, uncomfortable with ESPNs production, Nessler was replaced temporarily by Al Michaels. Breen was hired in 2006.Longevity has been in the news lately. Verne Lundquist decided to stop calling Southeastern Conference football games, which he has done for CBS since 2000, after the coming season. But CBS will replace Lundquist, a joyful, big-game voice, with Nessler, who lacks the ability to convey effective excitement, even in big games.Chris Berman is reported to be nearing his end at ESPN, although nothing has been confirmed by him or the network. A crucial personality at ESPN nearly from its inception, Berman has become a caricature of his better self by failing to adjust his once-playful shtick and boisterous personality to the 21st century.Sean McDonough recently received the biggest break of his career, promoted by ESPN to call Monday Night Football after Mike Tirico went to NBC, where he is a candidate to succeed Michaels on Sunday Night Football.No one expects Michaels to leave soon, but Tirico is only 49. He can wait.Breen has had his big break. He has his dream job and shares it with Jackson and Van Gundy, friends for 25 years through their Knicks connections.The most underrated part of our business is the continuity and comfort level we have because you know where theyre going, Breen said. Its like the game  players who play together a long time just get better.He occasionally looks back at old games to see how he can improve and relies on friends and colleagues for guidance. (By contrast, Albert listens to old tapes of his mentor, Marty Glickman, to remind himself of how best to call a game.)One of Breens advisers, the producer Ken Wolfe, once watched one of the five games Breen called in a particular week and told him he sounded uninterested in that one, a blowout. He told me, You didnt bring the proper energy, and if thats the only game a fan watched, hed think this guy wasnt very good.Another friend, Mike McCarthy, a former executive at the network MSG, counseled him to build to a crescendo so that Im not screaming, Were tied at 10!During Game 2 of the finals Sunday night, Breen brought an elevated level of excitement to a brilliant stretch of basketball by Golden State in the fourth quarter that began with a long shot by Stephen Curry.Four to shoot, Breen said with an unusual amount of delight in his familiar voice. Curry, from the 28-foot line  whoa-ho!  Steph Curry from way downtown!Soon after a missed shot by Cleveland  a sequence that starred Leandro Barbosa  Breen had this high-energy play-by-play: Curry comes ahead of the pack, to Barbosa  off the glass!To Jackson, who earlier had discussed how the Warriors take your will where you begin to doubt you want to fight, Breen added: This is one of those deflating stretches you spoke of.Then Breen shifted with brio to another will-sapping Golden State play: Barbosa, with the steal  the Brazilian Blur  a 27-point game!It was such a dandy sequence of announcing that you didnt want ABC to go to a break and interrupt Breen or the offensive flow of the Warriors.During the series opener Thursday, Breen had a game-long challenge: how to call a lousy shooting night by Curry, ordinarily a 3-point master. Breen shifted his language, offering up different words for similar results. An early call  Curry, the mismatch, Curry the 3!  gave way to a chronicle of a 4-for-15 performance: Missed shot by Curry, Curry off the glass, cant fall, Curry  not that time, and Curry gets inside  left-handed, wont go.Breen said in an interview: Curry has a night like that every once in a while, but that wasnt the surprise. Even Michael Jordan had some rough games. The surprise was how well they were playing without him."}
{"text": "CREDIT SUISSE BOSS FACES REVOLT  |  Credit Suisse, the second-largest bank in Switzerland after UBS, is in open revolt just a year after Tidjane Thiam took over as chief executive and shifted the banks focus to wealth management,\nLandon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook. Shares in Credit Suisse are also down 50 percent over the last year.For decades, Credit Suisse was dominated both culturally and financially by a richly paid banking elite and these  deal makers are now furious at Mr. Thiam. He has cut their pay and blamed them for the $6 billion in losses that the firm has had on his watch.Credit Suisse isnt the only bank to move away from traditional investment banking, but Mr. Thiam has done little to hide his disdain for these activities. The question is whether his blunt, domineering style will end up alienating bankers rather than persuading them of the merits of his strategy.It is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic, said Guy Moszkowski, a longtime securities analyst at Autonomous Research.It is no surprise that he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses. There needs to be a cultural change, he said in a television interview in March,  in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay.In turn, deal makers in London and New York, who have seen their bonuses cut by nearly 40 percent, have not hidden their dislike for him.Several bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, grumbled that Mr. Thiam had lost the building. Thats Wall Streets way of saying that he no longer commanded the respect of traders.   Bankers also said that when Mr. Thiam has appeared on television in recent months, employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen.Many at Credit Suisse find Mr. Thiams personal style jarring. He enjoys a robust social life and has been making the rounds at clubs in London and Davos, Switzerland, while thousands are being laid off and stock is at a multiyear low.His defenders say he has no choice, because Credit Suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives. And wealth managers in Switzerland and Asia are embracing the new strategy. He also asked his board for a 40 percent cut in his bonus, taking in $4.5 million for the six months he worked last year.The board continues to stand by him, but Richard E. Thornburgh, a former Credit Suisse banker with 30 years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the boards risk committee, has met with top bankers and traders to hear them out and urge them to remain focused on their clients.For the moment, Mr. Thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his bankers to ensure the success of his grand plan. Is there a vision. Is there a direction? Mr. Thiam asked in a speech last year. The Germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end.PANAMA PAPERS SHOW HOW RICH U.S. CLIENTS HID MILLIONS ABROAD  |  The New York Timess examination of the Panama Papers has found that Mossack Fonseca had at least 2,400 United States-based clients over the past decade and set up at least 2,800 companies on their behalf in the British Virgin Islands, Panama, the Seychelles and other jurisdictions that specialize in helping to hide wealth. The trove of internal documents from the law firm were obtained by the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and has now been shared with The Times. \nThe documents show that Mossack Fonseca did much more than create offshore shell companies and accounts,\nEric Lipton and Julie Creswell report. For many American clients, the firm offered a guide to skirting or evading United States tax and financial disclosure laws. \nThe methods included locating an individual from a tax-convenient jurisdiction to be the straw man owner of an offshore account or encouraging a client to use his foreign passports to open offshore accounts and avoid regulatory scrutiny. If the compliance department at one foreign bank contacted by Mossack Fonseca asked too many questions, the firm simply turned to other, less inquisitive banks. The firms clients included people with criminal records, in spite of its public stance of not working with individuals convicted of crimes. \nFederal law allows United States citizens to transfer money overseas, but these foreign holdings must be declared to the Treasury Department, and any taxes on capital gains, interest or dividends must be paid. Federal officials estimate that the government loses  $40 billion to $70 billion a year in unpaid taxes on offshore holdings.\nExperts who examined the documents were reluctant to declare that the law firm or its clients had broken any laws given that no charges had been filed, but they did say that they were surprised at how explicitly Mossack Fonseca had offered advice that appeared carefully crafted to help clients avoid United States tax laws.\nMossack Fonseca has said repeatedly that it had honored international tax and banking laws, but presented with summaries of several cases by The Times, it did not try to explain its actions. Our significantly expanded compliance office today not only evaluates new client candidates, but also existing accounts, and especially those that were established prior to the new international regulatory regime coming into effect, a representative said in a written statement, referring to a 2010 law passed by Congress. It wasnt always this way.\nThe American client list does not appear to include the sort of high-profile political figures that have emerged in other parts of the world, but Mossack Fonsecas services were in high demand by the rich and famous in the United States.

{"text": "Hillary Clinton became the first woman to capture the presidential nomination of one of the countrys major political parties on Monday night, according to an Associated Press survey of Democratic superdelegates, securing enough of them to overcome a bruising challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders and turn to a brutal five-month campaign against Donald J. Trump.In a yearlong nomination fight full of surprise twists, from the popularity of Mr. Sanders to the success of Mr. Trump, the revelation that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination was another startling development  especially coming on the eve of major primaries in California, New Jersey and other states. Mr. Sanders added to the drama by refusing to accept the A.P. survey and vowing to fight on, while Mr. Trump argued that he had done more for women than Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton was ebullient but also restrained as she received the news at an uncanny moment  almost eight years to the day after she ended her campaign against Barack Obama before a crowd of many teary women and girls. On Monday night, she shared the breakthrough with a jubilant audience at a campaign stop in Long Beach, Calif.I got to tell you, according to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do, dont we? Mrs. Clinton said. We have six elections tomorrow, and were going to fight hard for every single vote, especially right here in California.Like Mr. Obama eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination with the support of hundreds of superdelegates  the party insiders, Democratic officials, members of Congress, major donors and others who help select the nominee. Under Democratic rules, these superdelegates  approximately 720 in all  are allowed to back any candidate they wish and can change their allegiance any time before the Democratic National Convention in July.Mrs. Clinton has had relationships with many of the superdelegates for years, and her campaign began seeking their support as soon as she entered the race last spring. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has struggled to win their backing.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders competed most aggressively for so-called pledged delegates  the roughly 4,000 delegates won through state primaries and caucuses.The A.P. declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive nominee by reaching out to superdelegates who had not announced which candidate they were supporting, and confirming that enough were backing Mrs. Clinton to get her to the magic number of 2,383.But her aides were reluctant to proclaim the race over, for fear of depressing turnout on Tuesday  especially in California, where the race remains close  or appearing to take the victory for granted.Robby Mook, Mrs. Clintons campaign manager, said the A.P.s call was an important milestone but indicated Mrs. Clinton did not intend to declare victory until Tuesday night, when she will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates.Advisers to Mr. Sanders took a dim view of the math. He previously said he would lobby Clinton superdelegates to shift their support to him by arguing that he is the partys best chance to defeat Mr. Trump, and he particularly plans to target those superdelegates who represent states where Mr. Sanders won primaries and caucuses.The advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Sanders was aiming to win the California primary on Tuesday to bolster his argument to superdelegates that he is the stronger and more popular candidate than Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders, speaking on Monday night at a rally in San Francisco, did not acknowledge the news that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination, and instead defiantly vowed to continue his candidacy to the convention. But he also made clear that Tuesdays vote was make or break for the future of his campaign.Tomorrow is the most important primary in the whole Democratic nominating process  we are going to win here in California, Mr. Sanders said. He added that if he could win the Tuesday contests in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and do well in New Jersey, his campaign would be going into that convention with enormous momentum.Moments before Mr. Sanders took the stage, former State Senator Nina Turner of Ohio led thousands of supporters in a chant shouting, Fight on. Fight on. Fight on. It was a sentiment shared by many audience members like Alex Borja, 18, of Castro Valley, Calif., who said he was happy Mr. Sanders had not conceded to Mrs. Clinton and hoped he would remain in the race through the summer.I dont think its fair that they have basically coronated Hillary as the nominee from the beginning and, at this point, Bernie still has a chance to win the delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the convention, Mr. Borja said. He added, however, that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton if she were the nominee.Mr. Sanderss campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, issued a sharply worded statement that refused to accept the A.P. survey.It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committees clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer, Mr. Briggs said.Mr. Trump struck familiar notes on Monday night on Twitter, attacking Mrs. Clinton as unfit for the presidency, but he also put his own spin on making history during an interview with Fox News.I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women, more than anybody, in the construction industry, Mr. Trump said.For Mrs. Clinton, becoming her partys presumptive nominee is the latest chapter in a remarkable career that has taken her from being the first lady to being one election away from returning to the White House as president.She planned a victory rally on Tuesday in Brooklyn, but by the time The A.P. had called the contest, she seemed to already be in a celebratory mood, ending a campaign slog that had been expected to come to a close after the early contests but dragged on to just before the final votes were tallied, at a Shes With Us concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles with John Legend, Christina Aguilera and Stevie Wonder.Mrs. Clinton had for weeks hardly hid her eagerness to put the primary contests against Mr. Sanders behind her and to turn her full focus to the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump.Talking to voters at the Hawkins House of Burgers in the Watts section of Los Angeles, Mrs. Clinton promised to take on Mr. Trump all the time, and, earlier that day, she urged Mr. Sanderss supporters to consider the consequences if Mr. Trump captured the White House.Anyone whos supported me, anyone who has supported Senator Sanders has a lot at stake in this election in preventing Donald Trump from being our president, which I can barely say, she told reporters on Monday.But Mrs. Clinton must also work in the coming weeks to improve her own standing with voters, both with Mr. Sanderss hordes of young supporters and with a majority of registered voters who say they do not like or trust her.Still, many Democratic allies of Mrs. Clinton did not want to wait until Tuesdays primaries to celebrate, writing Twitter posts and issuing statements hailing her as the nominee and trying to shift the Democratic Partys focus and the national political conversation to take aim at Mr. Trump.Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who now advises a pro-Clinton super PAC, said in an email: Its beyond words; incredibly moving for me personally  but premature. We dont want to crush democracy. Still six states tomorrow whose votes must be counted. Its crucial to encourage people to vote.At Mrs. Clintons rally on Monday evening in California, several voters expressed exhilaration at her historic victory. Its about time, said Maria Garibay, a retired manufacturing analyst. But others also braced themselves for a final showdown with Mr. Sanders and ferocious fight against Mr. Trump.I hope Bernie goes out gracefully, said Helen Satorius, a retired high school counselor. We need to beat Trump, completely and totally. So I think now he needs to just be willing to unite."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  President Obama, after months of sitting on the sidelines of the rancorous contest to succeed him, is now ready to aggressively campaign for Hillary Clinton, starting with a formal endorsement of her candidacy as early as this week.The White House is in active conversations with Mrs. Clintons campaign about how and where the president would be useful to her, according to senior aides to Mr. Obama.Advisers say the president, who sees a Democratic successor as critical to his legacy, is impatient to begin campaigning. They say he is taking nothing for granted.I want us to run scared the whole time, Mr. Obama told a group of donors on Friday night in Miami.It has been decades since a second-term president enjoyed the popularity to be a potent force on the campaign trail, and to have an invitation from the candidate running to succeed him to be a major presence there.Mr. Obamas approval rating was at 50 percent in this months New York Times/CBS poll, and strategists close to Mrs. Clinton said they would be eager to have his participation as the general election unfolded. (In contrast, President George W. Bushs approval rating was at 20 percent in a Gallup poll just before the November 2008 election, and he rarely appeared that year with Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee.)Mr. Obama is particularly enthusiastic, aides said, about taking on Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Trump has personally offended the president with his conduct on the campaign trail  Mr. Trump referred on Friday to a black man in one of his crowds as my African-American  and as the most visible champion of the birther conspiracy theories that falsely hold that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya rather than Hawaii.The Associated Press reported Monday evening that Mrs. Clinton had reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination, one day before six states hold their primary contests. Mr. Obama is likely to move swiftly to make a case for her.He has indicated he wants to spend a lot of time on the campaign trail, so when its time to do that, well go out guns ablazing, Jennifer Psaki, Mr. Obamas communications director, said in an interview. We are actively thinking through how to use the president on the campaign trail  what works for the nominee, what works for him, and how to utilize his strengths and his appeal.Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clintons communications director, said Mrs. Clinton hoped to earn Mr. Obamas endorsement and his active participation in the campaign during the summer and fall.Theres no one better to lay out the two paths voters will face in the fall elections, Ms. Palmieri said, and he is particularly strong at making the economic argument for her.Advisers to Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton believe that the president, who ran against Mrs. Clinton in a sometimes nasty primary campaign in 2008, can be a persuasive voice for voters who may find her difficult to relate to or who have supported the more liberal stances of her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.As former opponents, they have an amazing story, Ms. Palmieri said, adding that it would be hard to imagine a more convincing advocate for her.Some Democrats speculated on Monday that by discussing Mr. Obamas plans to jump into the campaign fray, his team was hoping to nudge Mr. Sanders from the race, signaling that the time was coming for him to abandon his bid.Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders spoke by telephone over the weekend, discussing the path forward after the Tuesday primary contests, according to a person familiar with the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the call was meant to remain confidential.In the conversation, the person said, Mr. Obama essentially put Mr. Sanders on notice that he would soon move to endorse Mrs. Clinton. The call was first reported by NBC News.If Mr. Sanders is considering leaving the race, he refused to acknowledge it on Monday when reporters questioned him about what would happen if Mrs. Clinton clinched the nomination.Our focus right now is running and winning right here in California, Mr. Sanders told reporters in Emeryville, Calif.The White House argues that Mr. Obama could help Mrs. Clinton appeal to independent voters  particularly suburban independent women  in the Midwest, notably its northern stretch including Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Mr. Obama won all three states in 2012 in part by painting Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, as a corporate raider who would shut down factories and move jobs overseas.Officials in the White House and close to Mrs. Clintons team point to the presidents appeal to African-American and young voters  groups who favor him more than her  as helpful to turning those groups out for her in November. African-American and young voters will play a crucial role, the aides said, in battlegrounds like Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Mr. Obama won all four states in 2012.The process comes after months of more informal contact between the White House and the Clinton and Sanders campaigns and is still in its early stages. Advisers to Mr. Obama, speaking on the condition of anonymity about his plans because Mrs. Clinton has yet to secure the Democratic nomination, said the president had not begun drafting his address for next months Democratic National Convention or finalized any particular campaign itinerary.The first look at Mr. Obamas campaign for Mrs. Clinton came on Wednesday, when he used a speech in Elkhart, Ind.  the first American city he visited as president in 2009  to lay out an argument against the Republican economic agenda and, without naming him, an indictment of Mr. Trump.Mr. Obama signaled that day that he would soon throw his full support behind Mrs. Clinton. He said Tuesdays primary contests, including those in California and New Jersey, would yield a pretty good sense of who the nominee will end up being.Hes been very respectful of both of them and careful not to put his thumb on the scale, but at some point, the verdict is the verdict, and that point is almost certainly Tuesday, which is what he was saying, said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obamas presidential campaign and at the White House. I expect that hell be a force for trying to move this process along so the party can consolidate and unify.White House and Clinton campaign officials declined to pinpoint any timing for an endorsement. But Mr. Obama has scheduled a trip to New York on Wednesday to attend Democratic fund-raisers, placing him near Mrs. Clintons Brooklyn campaign headquarters the day after Tuesdays balloting.At the White House on Monday, Josh Earnest, the press secretary, repeatedly declined to discuss the timing of any forthcoming endorsement by Mr. Obama, at one point teasing a reporter who asked why the president would not weigh in on Wednesday.Well, I dont know, Mr. Earnest said with a smile. Maybe he will.Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster, said Mr. Obamas position and popularity made him ideally suited to counter Mr. Trumps message of economic anxiety. But he cautioned that the presidents approval rating, and his effectiveness on Mrs. Clintons behalf, could plunge if he engaged in a bitter, personal back-and-forth with the Republican nominee.No one really rewards politicians fighting each other in a general election, Mr. Brodnitz said. The party is full of attack dogs. I think the president is the one person who does not need to be an attack dog if he can make people feel just a little bit better about our economic future.Mr. Obamas regular presence on the campaign trail could have some downsides. Ed Rollins, who ran Ronald Reagans re-election campaign in 1984, said Mrs. Clinton could be overshadowed by the kind of charisma that Mr. Obama showed on the stump in 2008 and 2012.Shes tired, said Mr. Rollins, who is supporting a super PAC backing Mr. Trump. Shes not a very good candidate. Theres a high risk there of her getting overshadowed."}
{"text": "Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton will be hoping that Tuesday, when the California primaries take place, will be the moment she can start looking forward to facing Donald J. Trump with a united front.Republican supporters of Mr. Trump hope it will be the moment he stops looking backward and focuses on the November fight.The Democratic primary in California is an opportunity for Bernie Sanders to argue to the partys officials that he deserves their backing at the convention in July. If he loses to Mrs. Clinton, that argument will be more difficult to make. The Republican primary is effectively over, but Mr. Trump has marched on regardless.Of the candidates, Mr. Trump is the one who should be having an easier time. After he vanquished his primary rivals and diminished Stop Trump movements, top Republicans in Congress backed him. Even some of his critics muted their commentary. But Mr. Trump has continued to pick at the scabs of the primary, while making criticisms of a prominent Hispanic Republican governor and of a federal judge overseeing a case against the defunct Trump University.Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday that the moment would come, after Tuesday, for her to reach out to Mr. Sanderss supporters. But Mr. Sanders is showing little sign of making such overtures. On Sunday, he directly criticized the Clinton Foundation and scoffed at suggestions the race would be over this week. On Sunday evening, Mrs. Clinton won the Puerto Rico primary, however, a victory that brings her closer to the number of delegates she needs to clinch the nomination."}

{"text": "For Viacom, selling a stake in its Paramount film studio has become potentially more difficult  thanks to its controlling shareholder.National Amusements, the theater chain through which Sumner M. Redstone controls his media empire, said on Monday that it had altered Viacoms corporate bylaws to prevent the entertainment company from selling any part of Paramount without the approval of the full board.National Amusements holds about a 10 percent stake in Viacom  but nearly 80 percent of Viacoms voting stock. Among Viacoms board members are Mr. Redstone himself and his daughter, Shari Redstone.Viacom said in February that it was exploring selling a piece of Paramount after receiving interest from a number of potential buyers. Philippe P. Dauman, Viacoms chief executive, has said that a sale could help share the costs of movie productions and improve the studios distribution.The announcement on Monday is likely to delay a potential sale until the legal disputes can be resolved, which could be months or longer. Through his representatives, Mr. Redstone has made known his objections to a Paramount deal.The studio has long been described as one of Mr. Redstones most prized assets. A geriatric psychiatrist who examined Mr. Redstone recently said that Mr. Redstone referred to Paramount as his baby, and that he expressed his emphatic disapproval of a sale. Mr. Dauman in a court filing on Monday said the doctors report was biased.In a statement on Monday, Carl Folta, a Viacom spokesman, said, These illegitimate actions stem directly from the invalid changes made to the National Amusements Inc. board and are completely at odds with good corporate governance.A Paramount spokesman declined to comment.The decision puts yet another wrinkle in the struggle between Mr. Redstone and Mr. Dauman, who was once the 93-year-old moguls top lieutenant.Over the last several weeks, Mr. Dauman has begun waging open warfare with representatives for Mr. Redstone and with Shari Redstone. Their dispute revolves around the May 20 dismissals of Mr. Dauman and George S. Abrams, another Viacom director, from the trust that will oversee Mr. Redstones companies when he dies or is declared incompetent.Both men were also removed from the National Amusements board.Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams have filed a lawsuit contesting the moves, arguing in court that Mr. Redstone lacked the mental capacity to make those decisions. They have accused Ms. Redstone of manipulating her father.In its statement on Monday, National Amusements said that its move regarding Paramount was not connected to that legal dispute. Instead, the company said that it wanted to ensure that a sale of any part of Paramount was done as part of a sensible long-term strategy.While National Amusements is not opposed to a transaction that would unlock value at Paramount, it firmly believes that any proposed transaction should be thoroughly vetted and approved by Viacoms full board, and the rationale for such a transaction should be clearly articulated to Viacoms stockholders in advance, National Amusements said.In its statement, National Amusements criticized recent comments by Frederic Salerno, Viacoms lead independent director, who said last week that it was important for the companys growth to proceed with its plans to sell a stake in Paramount.We hope that the fight over control does not impair or completely undermine this potential step with Paramount, Mr. Salerno said in a letter that also proclaimed the Viacom directors intention to fight any attempt to remove them from the board.The theater chain said that those comments showed that Viacoms independent directors appeared more interested in their own positions than in doing what was right for all of the media companys shareholders.But other Viacom investors have supported a deal for Paramount, including Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS behind Mr. Redstone. He has called a Paramount transaction a logical step for Viacom.Paramount executives, caught by surprise when Mr. Dauman said in February that Viacom was entertaining offers for a minority stake, are likely to greet Mondays development with a sigh of relief. New stakeholders could have agitated for a management shake-up at the studio, which has been struggling with little end in sight.Paramount, which for the last four years, has ranked last among Hollywoods major studios in terms of domestic market share, is trying to rebuild its pipeline after a long period of lessening risk by releasing fewer films, which also limited profits. Last year, Paramount released about a dozen movies. Most major studios release about 20. Efforts by Paramount to restart older franchises, including the Terminator series, have also run aground.Over the weekend, Paramount suffered another setback. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, one of the studios big summer bets, turned in a weak $35.3 million in domestic ticket sales.Not everything at Paramount has been a disaster. The low-cost thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane was a modest hit in March, and the studio has been aggressively trying to build a television division. Leonardo DiCaprios production company, Appian Way, recently ended an alliance with Warner Bros. in favor of Paramount."}
{"text": "For a $24.9 billion deal, it is a piddling sum: an extra $24.7 million plus about $12 million in interest.Yet a Delaware judges recent ruling that the deal  the 2013 buyout of Dell  had shortchanged shareholders by that amount has roiled a debate on how it may affect buyouts more broadly.The law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz has criticized the decision for forcing a buyer to pay a 30 percent higher price in a fully shopped deal. According to the law firm, this decision may lead to shareholders losing out as private equity firms fear to do deals and hedge funds seek to win big on appraisal awards.My DealBook colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote that the decision was likely to lead to a spate of lawsuits and second-guessing over the price of the next big mergers and acquisitions.Matt Levine at Bloomberg View criticized the opinions methodology for its reliance on Dell being the only one willing to pay this price in the marketplace and moreover willing to take the risk of taking the company private.Much of the criticism has centered on the fact that the Delaware judge  in deciding that the fair value of Dell shares was $17.62 a share, far above the $13.65 paid by the buyout consortium led by the companys founder, Michael S. Dell  found that there was no significant fault with the conduct of the companys directors and that no other bidder had emerged for Dell shares.So should we be worried that this decision will change buyouts?The answer is probably no, because of the deeply weird nature of appraisal and this case.First, lets keep in mind how small the outcome of this case was. Some 20 Dell shareholders are entitled to an additional $37 million.The ruling came in an appraisal rights proceeding. In such a proceeding, shareholders of a company are allowed to go to court and argue that they were not paid fair value for their shares in the acquisition. The different amount is based on the courts determination of whether the acquisition price was the fair value of the shares.Under the arcane laws of appraisal, only Dells shareholders who voted against this acquisition and properly exercised appraisal rights will get the extra amount. (Some shareholders cases, including T. Rowe Price, which would have received over $200 million, were thrown out on procedural grounds.)The purpose of appraisal rights is not to say what the companys market price should have been. Appraisal is about giving shareholders a remedy if they think the negotiated deal price is just not good enough.Appraisal is thus about finding a judicially determined fair value  the standard the court determines whether to award more money to a dissenting shareholder. The terms market price and fair value can have different meanings, and fair value is not necessarily the price paid in the market.This difference is at the heart of the dispute over this decision and highlights the battle going on over appraisal rights themselves. Courts are struggling to figure out what fair value is in light of the emergence of hedge funds specializing in exercising appraisal rights.Historically, appraisal proceedings were reduced to a corporate finance exercise as each party hired an expert to value the company using discounted cash flow and other methodologies.In the case of the Dell buyout, Glenn Hubbard was Dells expert (yes, that Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbias Graduate School of Business and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush). He calculated fair value was $12.68 a share. Brad Cornell, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, was the expert for the dissident shareholders. He came out at $28.61.What is a judge, who is not an expert in valuations, to do?Frustration in recent years over this battle of the experts has led Delaware courts to change how they calculate appraisal prices.Instead of simply having to puzzle through conflicting expert opinions, judges have in recent cases looked to the merger price to determine if the price was fair. So long as the price paid was negotiated through an arms-length process, the court deemed this to be fair value. The underlying assumption of course was that the fairly bargained market price was fair value.Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery found that the process was not entirely complete because the Dell board did not reach out to all parties, something I had highlighted during this dispute.To be fair, however, the Dell board did later bend over backward to try to get things right.Vice Chancellor Laster also asserted that because the pricing was based on a leveraged buyout model, it was not a market price. That model is one where the buyers price is based on what it thinks its returns will be and is used by private equity firms. In this situation, a private equity firm would pay only what would produce a targeted rate of return.This is not quite so neat in the real world, but the use of a leveraged buyout model to price this transaction led the judge to determine that the market price was not a reliable one, because it showed merely the price the private equity firm could pay, not one that was fair value. In contrast, Vice Chancellor Laster argued that a strategic acquirer, a competitor of Dell, for example, would pay what the company was worth, closer to fair value.Because the buyout price was not a good one to determine fair value, the judge instead conducted an old-style appraisal proceeding where he used a discounted cash flow analysis to compute fair value using the expert opinions. Discounted cash flow analysis is a financial technique that values the future revenue streams of the company to determine an investments potential. This type of analysis involves numerous estimates including what the company will earn in the future.A different result was thus inevitable, and that is how the court got to $17.65 a share.The decision highlights the problems with appraisal generally. Judges are being forced to apply a law and to value companies based on a notion of fair value that is uncertain at best.As a result, the Dell case is unlikely to be a game changer. The market price is likely to continue to be the price used because it is so difficult to compute fair value otherwise.The opinion may affect management buyouts, but that may not be such a bad thing  forcing would-be managers to work hard to justify buying their own companies would be better for shareholders. In any case, management buyouts are rare these days; only two were proposed in 2015, according to Factset MergerMetrics.Yet there will be probably no impact outside management buyouts. Indeed, if the amount at stake in the Dell case had been more significant, I would hazard a guess that the judge just might have hesitated.In the end, I agree in large part with the critics of the Delaware ruling. They just assume that the opinion will become the norm. I dont think so for the reasons above.But lets keep one goal in mind about this decision and its ruling. If appraisal isnt there to serve as a check on management  or to be something more than the acquisition price  what is it good for? Not much."}
{"text": "My primary consultant is myself, Donald Trump said back in March when asked whom he turns to for foreign policy advice. This turns out to be his approach to pretty much everything.The latest example: According to Bloomberg Politics, a Trump campaign staffer emailed surrogates on Sunday telling them not to talk about the Trump University case. Mr. Trump had been facing criticism for his racist comments about the judge in that case, Gonzalo Curiel, and the email told surrogates, The best possible response is the case will be tried in the courtroom in front of a jury  not in the media.Mr. Trump had other ideas. Are there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks? he asked in a conference call high-profile Republicans on Monday. You guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that arent so smart.He went on to instruct listeners to go on the offensive if journalists asked about the case. The people asking the questions  those are the racists, he said. I would go at em.And, in classic Trump fashion, he said: Ive always won and Im going to continue to win. And thats the way it is.This comes on the heels of reports that Mr. Trump lacks anything resembling a conventional campaign apparatus. Benjy Sarlin, Katy Tur and Ali Vitali write at MSNBC that while most campaigns have staff members ready to respond quickly to criticisms, Mr. Trump has largely failed to build such a team. The campaigns meager response to the Trump University scandal, the writers explain, left the candidate to fill the vacuum with a torrent of demagoguery. According to one Republican strategist, no one is really allowed to speak on behalf of the candidate except the candidate.The staff Mr. Trump does have may be no more appealing than the candidate himself  his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with battery in March. But Mr. Trumps unwillingness to listen to anyone is disturbing because he has no experience governing. He would be in desperate need of guidance on foreign policy, as Carol Giacomo has noted, and in many other areas.Early in the campaign, Mr. Trumps response to specific policy questions was often to assure voters that he would hire intelligent people to work on the problem. In his book Crippled America, he wrote that to develop a replacement for Obamacare, we should hire the most knowledgeable people in the world on this subject and lock them in a room  and not unlock the door until theyve agreed on the steps we need to take.Everything Mr. Trump has done so far suggests that even if he were able to identify the most knowledgeable people in the world on any subject, he probably wouldnt listen to them anyway."}

Stocks wobbled but remained higher after the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, gave a mixed view of the economy.KEEPING SCORE At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.64 percent and the Standard & Poors 500-stock index was up nearly 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.53 percent.YELLEN SPEECH Ms. Yellen spoke to the World Affairs Council in Philadelphia on Monday afternoon. She said the economy was improving, but was marked by so many uncertainties that it was not clear when the Fed should resume raising interest rates.Until Friday most investors had expected the Fed to raise interest rates this summer, but after a surprisingly weak May jobs report, they are unsure of the Feds intentions. Ms. Yellen, who called that report disappointing, had said recently that the Fed would probably raise interest rates in the next few months if the economy kept getting stronger. The Feds policy makers will meet next week.THE QUOTE The investment manager Luke Bartholomew of Aberdeen Asset Management said Ms. Yellen was noncommittal and investors may have been hoping for more details.I dont think there was enough to sort of swing the market either way, he said. Stocks weakened during Ms. Yellens remarks but returned to their prior levels within an hour.ENERGY Benchmark United States crude oil pared earlier gains and was up $1.07, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $49.69 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained 91 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $50.55 a barrel. Natural gas prices also rose.Shares of Chesapeake Energy climbed 11.7 percent and Southwestern Energy stock rose nearly 5 percent. Shares of Exxon Mobil added 1.1 percent.OIL TURMOIL The price of oil has rebounded over the last few months, but remains far lower than it was two years ago, causing a lot of pain for energy companies.The oil and gas exploration company Devon Energy said Monday it would sell almost $1 billion in assets later this year, sending its stock up 4.6 percent. The oil field services company Hercules Offshore filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year. Hercules plans to sell all of its assets to pay off investors, including international divisions.Halliburton shares gained 4.8 percent and shares of Baker Hughes rose about 7 percent.FERTILIZER Shares of CF Industries climbed 8.9 percent, and Mosaic stock rose 6.2 percent. That helped pull materials and chemicals companies higher.BANKS Bank shares traded higher as bond yields made a modest recovery after a big drop on Friday. As bond prices fell, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.72 percent from 1.70 percent. Higher bond yields drive interest rates higher on long-term loans such as mortgages, which helps banks make more money from lending.ABBVIE STUDY Shares of the drugmaker AbbVie slid after investors were disappointed with results from a study of a lung cancer drug that AbbVie is acquiring. In April, AbbVie agreed to buy Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion, gaining the companys stem cell treatment ova-T in the process.

Do they become an excuse for millions of children to stare at screens for many hours each day?Should schools cancel summer vacation?In the Sunday Review article The Families That Cant Afford Summer, KJ DellAntonia writes:What are your kids up to this summer? Sounds like a casual question. But for working parents at this time of year, its loaded. What have you managed to pull together that will keep your kids engaged, healthy, happy and safe, while still allowing you to keep feeding and clothing them? For most parents, summer, that beloved institution, is a financial and logistical nightmare.Tolanda Barnette is hoping for a miracle for her 6-year-old son: The 41-year-old day care worker cant afford to enroll him at the center where she works, and shes just saved enough to move her family out of the shelter where theyve been living for the past year into an apartment in Durham, N.C. Theres no money for even the least expensive camp.Her only option is to leave the boy at home with his 12-year-old sister. My daughters not going to be happy, Ms. Barnette said. She doesnt want to spend her summer babysitting. Her daughter is also scheduled to stay with her father for part of the summer, an opportunity Ms. Barnettes 6-year-old doesnt have. Im really digging for something for him, she said. But if she fails? I dont know. I just dont know. I have to work. Its not an option.Most American schools take a 10- to 11-week break during the summer. The assumption that underlies summer vacation  that there is one parent waiting at home for the kids  is true for just over a quarter of American families. For the rest of us, the children are off, the parents are not. We can indulge our annual illusion of children filling joyful hours with sprinkler romps and robotics camp or we can admit the reality: Summers supposed freedom is expensive.In 2014, parents reported planning to spend an average of $958 per child on summer expenses. Those who cant afford camps or summer learning programs cobble together care from family members or friends, or are forced to leave children home alone. Self-care for 6- to 12-year-olds increases during the summer months, with 11 percent of children spending an average of 10 hours a week on their own. In July 2014, a South Carolina woman was arrested when she left her 9-year-old in a park while she worked. Parents afraid of being at the center of a similar incident may be more likely to park their kids in front of the TV.In summer, the lack of affordable child care and the achievement gap collide for lower income families. Most kids lose math skills over the summer, but low income children also lose, on average, more than two months of reading skills  and they dont gain them back. That puts them nearly three years behind higher income peers by the end of fifth grade, and the gap just keeps getting wider. Researchers credit the summer slide for about half of the overall difference in academic achievement between lower and higher income students.Students: Read the entire essay, then tell us  Should schools cancel summer vacation? Is it too much of a financial burden for most working parents to find child care for their children? After all, summer camp can be expensive. Do too many children fall behind academically during summer? Does summer just create more of a divide between the haves and have-nots in our society? Would year-round schooling be better, as many schools in California and Florida have? What do you spend your time doing during the summer? Do you learn anything new? Do you stay active or play games?

{"text": "LONDON  The citizens of Draguseni, Romania, were presented with a predicament on Sunday when they had to decide who should lead their village of 2,500: the incumbent mayor, Vasile Cepoi, or one of four challengers  two of whom were also named Vasile Cepoi.This was not the first time Mr. Cepoi, the mayor, was facing such familiar competition. In fact, electoral records showed that in all three of his successful bids since 2004, he faced at least one other Vasile Cepoi.Vasile is a very common name in Romania, and Cepoi is a similarly common surname in Draguseni, a municipality in the rural northern region of Bucovina, in the eastern Carpathian Mountains.Some residents there were confused by the lack of diversity, if not choice, in the mayoral race. A video posted online by the Romanian news channel Antena1 mocked some voters who appeared to have little idea which Mr. Cepoi was which, or what parties the homonymous contenders represented.Since the first free elections were held two decades ago in Romania, fraud has been common, according to reports by international election observers. Candidates and their parties have offered small gifts of food, drink or cash to lure voters, or encouraged electoral tourism  paying voters to visit multiple polling stations on Election Day, stuffing ballot boxes for their preferred candidates.Candidates for mayor in at least a quarter of Sundays major municipal races in Romania were under criminal investigation, mostly for allegations of corruption, according to reports  by Digi24, a Romanian news channel.In Draguseni, the challenges from two other Vasile Cepois raised the suspicion of some observers that the participation of similarly named candidates was not a coincidence.Mr. Cepoi, the incumbent, a member of the governing Social Democrat Party, said that he suspected that Mr. Cepoi from the Peoples Movement Party and Mr. Cepoi from the National Liberal Party were deliberately trying to confuse voters and deny him another term.In an effort to differentiate himself on the ballot, the mayor changed his name before the election to Vasile Lica Cepoi. He was re-elected with 82 percent of the vote, according to preliminary results from the Central Election Office."}
{"text": "MAGIC AND LOSSThe Internet as ArtBy Virginia Heffernan263 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.What are we  the hyperconnected citizenry of 2016, clutching our smartphones as close as a lover  to believe if Facebook cannot be trusted to deliver news with the cold, unblinking logic of a machine? How did we start thinking Facebook performed in the same robotic manner as the toaster?As the journalist Virginia Heffernan writes in Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art, we too often conflate the internet with the worlds of commerce or science rather than with creativity. For years technology had seemed to be the masculine form of the word culture, she writes. If you wanted to sell men on a culture story, you did well to frame it as a tech story  a story about the plumbing or stock price of Netflix rather than a story about the pixels that constitute Bloodline. Technology is built stuff that aims to be elegant and engaging. Apps are founded on science in the same sense that a watercolor is founded on science, where the chemistry of pigments and the physics of brush strokes are the science. But the resulting painting, if successful, hints at transcendence or at least luminous silence, something whereof we cannot speak.Heffernan is seeking an understanding of the aesthetic and animating spark of the greatest enterprise of our time. To do that she focuses on the building blocks of the internet  design, text, images, video and music  while meditating on themes of magic and loss. For every invention destined to change everything (again!), what do we lose in the fire?We follow Heffernan through the Smithsonian Natural Museum of Internet History, as she annotates the exhibits: the Kindle, with its lithe design and endless supply of books, usurper of the printed word; the MP3, compressing the rapture and idiosyncrasies of your favorite music, destroyer of the music business and the listening experience; YouTube, standing among the smoldering wreckage of the linear-minded entertainment industries, triumphant in its mesmerizing stunts, obscure clips and unboxing videos.This could be a somber exercise, examining the ashes of Pompeii rather than glimpsing the City on the Edge of Tomorrow. But Heffernan is a gleeful trickster, a semiotics fan with an unabashed sweet tooth for pop culture, who believes we shouldnt confuse grief over the passing of our favorite technology with resentment because some digital alchemy failed to preserve analog experiences: Whether or not we admit it, the internet and its artifacts are not just like their cultural precedents. Theyre not even a rough translation  or a strong misreading  of those precedents.Loss means plenty to mourn  at one point Heffernan trips into a memory hole for the cord-tangling days of gabbing on the house phone. That nostalgia feels outmoded in places, dwelling on the universality of Twitter as the networks audience stagnates, or discussing YouTube as the standard for user-created video as venues like Snapchat redefine the norms of uninhibited expression.But magic brings joy. And Heffernan is enthralled by the web, always stopping short of the techno-utopianism that leads innovators to speed past the consequences as humanity colonizes the future. In one breath she juxtaposes the socioeconomic divide between using apps or the ad-supported web with the phenomenon of white flight, the next shes punctuating a theory on visual literacy with an entire paragraph dedicated to the seductive wonders of each of Instagrams filters.Thats what makes Magic and Loss hold together: It embraces the internet as a work in progress. Its an enjoyable snapshot, perhaps imperfect, but always dangerously close to receding from view as we scroll onto whatevers next."}
{"text": "Russias sports ministry is embracing an uncharacteristic openness as it tries to project an atmosphere of reform to the global sports officials and the American authorities who are scrutinizing Russia over allegations of a government-run doping program.On Monday, only weeks after the ministry hired crisis communicators based in Washington to advise it, Natalia Zhelanova, the antidoping adviser to Russias sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, took to Twitter to answer questions in an unusual public question-and-answer session. The session was announced by the American public relations firm Burson Marstaller, which later helped the Russians announce the creation of a new doping education program in the country.Over the course of an hour, Ms. Zhelanova responded to 15 questions, advancing familiar messages without speaking in specifics.In one answer, she echoed Mr. Murkos recent broad apology for serious mistakes, writing, We acknowledge past problems and are working tirelessly to reform our antidoping program in the long term.Without defining those problems, Ms. Zhelanova denied the allegations that doping in Russia was part of a state-sponsored scheme.I don't believe there is any truth to these allegations, she posted. Clean athletes shouldnt be punished for the mistakes of others.Next week, on June 17, track and fields governing body  known as the International Association of Athletics Federation, or I.A.A.F.  will decide whether to lift a ban on Russian athletes. If the ban is not lifted, Russian athletes will be barred from competing in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which start Aug. 5.The International Olympics Committee has scheduled a meeting June 22, four days after the I.A.A.F. vote, at which it will consider collective responsibility versus individual justice, an I.O.C. spokesman said, to decide who is barred from the Rio Games.Were hopeful that the I.A.A.F. will make the right decision because were doing everything possible to regain trust, Ms. Zhelanova said in another post.Last month, a former longtime director of Russias antidoping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, said he had acted at the direction of the sports ministry to help athletes surreptitiously dope.Dr. Rodchenkov, who received the prestigious Order of Friendship from Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin, in 2014, was asked to resign by Mr. Mutko the next year, he said, the day after a report published by the World Anti-Doping Agency named him as a key actor in a state-run doping system.Ms. Zhelanova did not dispute Dr. Rodchenkovs characterization of his departure from the job, attributing the decision to the World Anti-Doping Agencys directive.WADA wrote to us saying he must go because he was at the heart of doping cover-up, taking money from athletes, Ms. Zhelanova said on Twitter.Dr. Rodchenkov  who has acknowledged making mixtures of steroids that sports officials provided to top athletes, and has also said he destroyed hundreds of tainted urine samples  has denied accepting bribes.He said that Mr. Mutko had suggested, in the palatial sports ministry headquarters in Moscow, that they take the civilized route and that he step down.Dr. Rodchenkov fled to the United States seven days later, he said, fearing for his safety. He brought with him one change of clothes and the laptop he used for work, including spreadsheets he said were sent to him by the Russian sports ministry, identifying the dozens of athletes who were taking part in a federal doping program.Dmitry S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, has called Dr. Rodchenkovs account slander by a turncoat.Hours after Mondays Twitter chat, the Russian sports ministry issued a news release through Burson Marsteller announcing the creation of a government program aimed at changing attitudes toward doping in Russia and advancing the message that doping is unacceptable.The program, the news release said, will include mandatory antidoping education for doctors, coaches, employees of sports federations and schoolchildren.According to Dr. Rodchenkov, it was not just Olympians who were doping in Russia. He said university-level athletes also took banned substances in international competition."}
{"text": "The Democratic race may already be over by the time the California polls open. According to The Associated Press, Hillary Clinton has already earned the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination. Yet in some ways California is still the most interesting contest between her and Bernie Sanders so far.Its hard to know how much the news may depress turnout, but it has easily been the closest contest in a big state, at least in the pre-election polls. And even though the election result wont affect the outcome of the race, the stakes are nonetheless real: the chance for Mr. Sanders to continue making his case to change the minds of superdelegates heading into the convention.Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders in all the polls. But the polls are close enough that he could win.On average, she leads by six percentage points among the six surveys that have been conducted over the last month. Four of them show an extremely tight race, with Mrs. Clinton leading by two points. The other two show her with a double-digit lead among likely voters.Its worth noting that we have the benefit of two of the most reliable polls in the business: the Field Poll and the Los Angeles Times/U.S.C./GQR poll. They show Mrs. Clinton with a two- and a 10-point lead, respectively. The P.P.I.C. poll, which has her up by two points, is also very well regarded.Three more familiar national pollsters have also surveyed the state: NBC/WSJ/Marist, SurveyUSA and CBS/YouGov. All three had solid results in primary seasons and have strong longer-term track records.These six polls are also methodologically diverse  two use voter-file samples (Field and LAT/GQR/U.S.C.); two use random-digit dialing (NBC/WSJ/Marist and P.P.I.C.); one is the top online panel (CBS/YouGov); and one, SurveyUSA, is the most innovative poll still employing automated calls to landline telephones (it surveys people on mobile apps as well).You can compare this to having a diversified stock portfolio. No method is perfect, and each has potential biases. My preference is for the voter-file-based sample (like Field and LAT/GQR/U.S.C.). But a diverse set of polls helps protect against the possibility that one of those potential biases is skewing our perception of the race.This does not mean that Mrs. Clinton will win. But a diverse number of higher-quality polls is reason to be somewhat more confident in her edge.The notion that California could be fairly competitive is not much of a surprise. In March, Mrs. Clinton had a six-point edge in the Upshots demographic-based estimates. The same model, updated to include the primary results since then, gives her a seven-point edge.Mrs. Clinton had an edge in our estimate for a simple reason: diversity and affluence. She has tended to do best among nonwhite voters and wealthy white voters. California is full of both. White voters without a college degree  a strength of Mr. Sanders  represent a decided minority of the Democratic electorate there.But the polls showing a close race  including Field, P.P.I.C., CBS/YouGov and NBC/Marist  suggest that Mrs. Clinton isnt taking advantage of the states huge population of nonwhite voters to quite the same extent that she has in other contests. According to the surveys, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are basically splitting both the white and nonwhite vote.This is surprising but not inexplicable. Most of the states nonwhite voters are Asian-American or Hispanic. Mrs. Clinton has always excelled among black voters, but the leanings of other nonwhite voters are somewhat less clear. Mrs. Clinton has generally won the Hispanic vote  including in Florida, Texas, Arizona and New York  but she lost it in Illinois. We have very little data on Asian-American voters because they represent such a small share of the population outside California.The big reason for the lack of a decided advantage for Mrs. Clinton, it seems, is voter age. Mr. Sanders is hugely popular among the young, and the nonwhite electorate in California is pretty young. Hispanic voters are generally young everywhere in the country, but contests in Florida, Arizona and New York that were open only to registered Democrats have resulted in a somewhat older Hispanic electorate than what you would get in an open contest like California. Texas and Illinois are probably the two better comparisons, and there the results were a split decision.Whats obvious is that turnout among young nonwhite voters is pretty important to Mr. Sanderss chances, and its a big question mark.Mrs. Clinton is accumulating a significant lead in the early absentee voting thats already underway.All of the polls show her with a lead among voters who have already cast ballots. Data from Political Datas Paul Mitchell makes it very clear why: 69 percent of the vote that has been tabulated so far (2.7 million ballots for all primary races) has been from voters over age 55, while just 10 percent has come from voters ages 18 to 35. In comparison, 25 percent of registered voters are ages 18 to 35, and 41 percent are ages 55 and over.Part of this is inevitable. Older voters send in their ballots early, and young people vote closer to the deadline.But theres another catch: No Party Preference voters (as opposed to registered Democrats) had to specifically request Democratic ballots to participate in the primary. Many did not. Mr. Mitchells data indicates that just 15 percent of No Party Preference voters requested a Democratic ballot; the rest did not receive a ballot with the Democratic contest.This creates a big burden for Mr. Sanders. Many of his voters  including those who usually vote by mail  will need to vote in person on Election Day to receive a ballot. Mrs. Clintons base of registered Democrats, on the other hand, will receive the right ballot in the mail. This will contribute to a higher turnout among registered Democrats.To win, Mr. Sanders is going to need to get a very high turnout from these voters. It can happen  the polls show a close enough race. But theres as much downside as upside here for him: You could imagine that pollsters are giving the self-reported vote intention of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clintons supporters equal weight, even though his voters have more hoops to jump through.Mrs. Clintons big early vote lead has another advantage: it helps insulate her against the possibility of lower turnout in the aftermath of many news networks calling the Democratic race for Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clintons lead in the early absentee vote poses another problem for Mr. Sanders: the vote count.Whether he ultimately wins or not, she is probably going to have a lead in the early count. Thats because the ballots that were received ahead of the election will be counted first, and those votes will be disproportionately composed of older registered Democrats.Mr. Sanders could then steadily erode Mrs. Clintons margin  first with the votes cast on Election Day, then with the late mail ballots. These late ballots tend to be from younger voters, and should be stronger for Mr. Sanders.A similar phenomenon happened in 2008: Mrs. Clinton opened with more than a 20-point lead in California; she ultimately won by just eight points (though in 2008, some of the early vote was for John Edwards). In Oregon, where elections are entirely by mail, Mr. Sanders opened with a six-point lead and ultimately won by 13 points.This process will not happen fast. In general, only about 70 percent of the California vote is tabulated by noon the next day. Thats in part because ballots dont have to arrive on Election Day.On balance, this is bad news for the winner. It makes it very hard for the networks to make a quick projection, unless someone wins by a clear margin.But this is a bigger problem for Mr. Sanders. If Mrs. Clinton wins by, say, five points in the end, my guess is that she will probably be the projected winner on election night. She may hold an early double-digit lead, which would make her look even stronger than her ultimate standing.But Im not sure Mr. Sanders will get an election night projection of victory if hes on track to win by five points. He could easily trail for hours after the polls close and potentially for days in a particularly tight race, while she will most likely be declared the New Jersey primary winner, and her status as the presumptive nominee will be confirmed.A long count in California might not be the sort of show of strength he needs to push back against the presumptive nominee."}

{"text": "WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  Free million dollar idea: BACON POWDER.Im being totally serious.And Im not talking about those Bacn Pieces Bacon-Flavored Bits food products either, which leave out the o for legal reasons and are an abomination of nature. Im talking about real dehydrated and powdered bacon, which could be used to deliver a delicious dose of salty goodness to just about any food, including smoothies. Someone get on that, please, and do remember me in your will. Times are tough in journalism.Oh right, the puzzle. Welcome back, Sean Dobbin. We havent seen you since January.Todays puzzle takes five famous actors whose surnames substitute for the elided version of the first word of a two-word, common item and then are clued differently from their original meaning in a clever and punny way.Clear as mud? Here, let me show you exactly what this means:17A: Actor William Holden --> holding tank --> HOLDEN TANK, the military vehicle for actor William\n24A: Actor Kevin Bacon --> baking powder --> BACON POWDER, the million dollar idea and makeup for actor Kevin\n36A: Actor Ted DANSON --> dancing shoes --> DANSON SHOES, the footwear for actor Ted\n47A: Actor Christopher Walken --> walking stick --> WALKEN STICK, the cudgel for actor Christopher\n57A Actor Michael Landon --> landing gear --> LANDON GEAR, the equipment for actor Michael 1As Young fellow for BUCKO was tricky for me, because I dont think of being a bucko as necessarily age-restricted. Male, yes. Young? Maybe. The phrase Now listen here, bucko  doesnt necessarily imply age to me. 16As Arnold, Ronald or Roland seems like it might be trickier than it is on the surface, but Ill caution you against overthinking in this case. The answer is simply NAME. Theyre all NAMEs. A clue in brackets rather than quotes, like 42As [That is so disgusting!] means that you are being asked to come up with a synonymous sound. In Mr. Dobbins puzzle, that sound is GAG. 1Ds clue, Cs equivalent, is looking for a matching musical key. In this case, that would be B SHARP. At 4D, I had CONS, then VANS, then finally KEDS. Who can keep up with kids and their fancy sneakers these days?-34Ds Two of nine? is asking you to count letters again. There are two Ns (ENS) in the word nine. 36D: You could get get crossword whiplash from a clue like this. We had land line? as a clue in a recent Patrick Berry puzzle and the entry was referring to a COAST. So of course I thought there was misdirection in this clue as well, and tried to think of what might be a feature of a coast, but not a cellphone. The answer was fairly literal: a land line telephone has a DIAL TONE, while a cellphone does not. As a fan of Charles Dickens, I was thrilled to find this wonderful quote from Mr. Bumble of Oliver Twist in my puzzle. When told in court that the legal assumption was that his domineering wife operated under his direction, he replies, If the LAW supposes that  the LAW is a ass  a idiot. If thats the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience  by experience.Lets hear from Mr. Dobbins:Im happy to see BERN clued here as something other than the Swiss city, and I wish I could take credit for it.  Nope.  This puzzle was constructed a full two weeks before Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy, and it was Will who made the apt edit.Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "The Associated Press projected that Hillary Clinton was the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on Monday  a day earlier than she was expected to clinch  because it determined that she won the support of the majority of delegates: 2,383.Mrs. Clinton went over the top with the support of around 20 additional superdelegates, the officials who represent about 15 percent of the delegates to the Democratic convention. These delegates did not previously commit to Mrs. Clinton, but pledged their support to her in interviews with The A.P.Over all, the 2,383 delegates who support Mrs. Clinton include 1,812 pledged delegates  those bound based on the results of the primaries and caucuses  and 571 superdelegates, according to the A.P. count. The A.P. provides delegate counts and election results to many news organizations, including The New York Times.Bernie Sanders trails by more than 800 delegates. He holds 1,569 delegates, with 1,521 pledged delegates and 48 superdelegates.No one is surprised that Mrs. Clinton has clinched the nomination. Its just a surprise that she did it on Monday night.After winning Puerto Rico, Mrs. Clinton was not far from winning the nomination. It wasnt much of a secret that Mrs. Clinton held the support of the superdelegates needed to clinch.But it is widely believed that the Clinton campaign did not want to win with added support from unelected delegates, which might feed the perception that the Democratic race was rigged or otherwise determined by party elites, not the voters.If no additional delegates had supported Mrs. Clinton, she would have gone over the top shortly after the polls closed in New Jersey, around 8 p.m. on Tuesday. The state is worth 126 pledged delegates, and she was a heavy favorite in the state.Yes, the superdelegates are not bound to their pledges. This is why the Sanders campaign argues that Mrs. Clinton cant clinch the nomination until the convention in July. Its also why the news media characterizes her as the presumptive nominee; she wont officially be the nominee until a convention vote.But superdelegate pledges arent irrelevant, either. The pledges arent binding, but superdelegates know what theyre doing: They know that their pledges are monitored by news outlets, and that stating their support might ensure that Mrs. Clinton would become the presumptive nominee.The A.P. has repeatedly interviewed superdelegates, so its not likely that theres a big pool of delegates who pledged to her a year ago and have since switched. If anything, these early supporters are likely to be her strongest backers.And history provides reason to take them seriously. In 1984, Gary Hart failed miserably in trying to change superdelegates minds in his race against Walter Mondale.The news networks projected that Mr. Obama was the presumptive nominee in the 2008 Democratic primary based on the same rules for tabulating superdelegates. Mrs. Clinton did not decide it was worth taking the fight to the convention.Well, not Monday. But she would have won Tuesday if no superdelegates existed.Not only would Mrs. Clinton have won without superdelegates, but they were actually Mr. Sanderss only hope of winning.Thats because Mrs. Clinton has a considerable lead of 291 elected delegates, pledged based on the results of caucuses and primaries, according to the A.P. count. Mrs. Clinton earned her lead by winning more contests than Mr. Sanders, and she usually won by wider margins in races worth more delegates. In fact, Mrs. Clinton won 13 of the 15 biggest delegate wins of the cycle.With just seven contests left, Mr. Sanders would have needed to win around 70 percent of the remaining vote to capture a majority of those pledged delegates. Hes only hit 70 percent in one primary: his home state, Vermont.That meant that Mr. Sanders could win only if superdelegates decided to overrule the preferences of voters and support a candidate who lost the primaries. According to our projections, he might have needed to win about 70 or 75 percent of superdelegates at the convention in order to overcome Mrs. Clintons lead in pledged delegates.It was never likely that superdelegates who supported Mrs. Clinton would bolt for a candidate who lost the primary, let alone one who rails against the establishment. Its even more unlikely after the A.P. call: Mr. Sanderss only hope was that the superdelegates would break his way, but theyre actually moving to Mrs. Clinton.Quite possibly. Its not hard to imagine how the A.P. race call might depress turnout among the supporters of either candidate.Who will it hurt more? Its purely a matter of speculation. One could argue that Mrs. Clinton would benefit, since she has more regular and reliable voters. On the other hand, perhaps Mr. Sanderss supporters will be newly motivated to defy the partys establishment at a moment when Mrs. Clintons supporters will be complacent.Heres one thing thats clear: Mrs. Clinton has banked a considerable lead in the early vote in California. If Election Day turnout is down in California, those early votes will represent a larger share of the electorate."}

{"text": "PARIS  The Louvre and the Muse dOrsay were preparing on Monday to reopen after they moved tens of thousands of artworks to higher floors last week as a precaution against the rising level of the Seine River. Other French cultural institutions, including the historic Chteau de Chambord in the Loire Valley, reopened and were assessing the damage.After days of heavy rain, the Seine peaked at 20 feet, or about six meters, above normal Saturday morning, the highest level since December 1982, but short of the 26.2 feet reached in the flood of January 1910. On Monday morning, floodwaters had receded to about 17 feet.With the river rising on Thursday evening, the Louvre activated a flood protection plan and began moving about 150,000 artworks, mostly from storage rooms, to higher floors, a task that continued through Saturday. The museum said that it was assessing the situation on Monday and that the works remained in their new, temporary locations, adding that no water had entered the building.At the Muse dOrsay, on the Left Bank, a small amount of water entered the underground level and the museum will remain closed on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. The museum closed on Thursday night and moved 7,000 artworks, including 1,000 paintings, 300 pastels and 600 sculptures, to upper floors.There were small infiltrations in the basement but we are not up to our ankles in water, the spokeswoman, Amlie Hardivillier, said on Monday. All of the artworks were evacuated on Friday, so there is no damage. We just need to establish a diagnosis before we reopen.Outside Paris, many of the castles in the Loire Valley area were closed on Friday and Saturday. The Chteau de la Fert-St.-Aubin reopened to the public on Sunday, but water had infiltrated walls and the cellars were flooded, Lancelot Guyot, the sites manager, said on Monday.The Chteau de Chambord, a Unesco World Heritage site, reopened on Friday morning. Officials from the castle estimated water damage at 200,000 euros to 300,000 euros, or about $225,000 to $340,000, including a partly collapsed perimeter wall and flooding to employee housing."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  United States history is marked by modernization efforts aimed at leaving no one behind. In the 1930s, it was lighting up farmsteads with electricity. In the 1950s, it was paving highways to every town. Today, the federal government is trying to bring broadband, which it considers a utility, to an estimated 33 percent of residents who dont have the service.At the Federal Communications Commission, Mignon L. Clyburn, a Democratic member, has supported regulations to connect those remaining Americans. The agency recently approved broadband subsidies for low-income families. The F.C.C. also converted rural phone service grants to companies willing to bring broadband to remote areas.We sat with Ms. Clyburn, a former public utilities commissioner from South Carolina, to discuss the challenges of closing the digital divide.Q: What do we know about the people who arent able to obtain access to or afford broadband?A: Tens of millions of people are caught in the divide, and what we know is many are low-income and in rural areas. In total, 10 percent of Americans, or 34 million people, lack access to what we define as high-speed internet. Many more do not adopt broadband for many reasons  especially cost  and the adoption problem particularly affects low-income people.Many people who may not have broadband lines into their home get online through their phones. Perhaps we should view smartphone access as an imperfect substitute?They are complements but not substitutes because there are certain things that cant be done on smartphones. Look, if we have seen 45 states with frameworks where one in five public assistance programs are online, you need full access to the internet. The opportunity of a fixed broadband connection is so much greater, by way of speeds, the ability to fill out all forms and transfer files.This also affects low-income consumers in particular with 7.8 million low-income consumers who only have access through their mobile device. There are limitations with what you can do on your smartphone, and 48 percent lose coverage over the course of their contract because they cant afford it at some point. So they are getting counted for having broadband on their phones but they dont have continual coverage.Why arent people adopting internet when it is available to them? Is it just cost? Ive seen surveys citing skepticism over the relevance of the internet.What is the definition of relevance? And relative to what? I think someone who doesnt adopt may not admit to you that they have some type of challenge in digital literacy. They may say they dont need it when the real answer may be that they arent comfortable with a keyboard or mouse.Where do you see the biggest problems?I see the biggest challenges in persistent poverty areas, where investment hasnt organically flowed. So when investment doesnt flow, infrastructure isnt there. Then the hardware is not there, and then digital education isnt there. Its compounding.There isnt incentive for carriers to go into low-income areas where they may not make as much money. How do you balance their business concerns with your public interest concerns?Urban areas are more difficult from where I sit. In rural areas, people get the business issues and we have things like the Connect America Fund so money can flow to rural areas that cost more to serve.When you have dense urban areas, where on paper things seem to be working as far as the infrastructure being there, its more difficult to solve the problems.Lets take D.C. Across the street from my home is what people would call a public housing complex. Their world is completely different from mine. We are on the same block. And I guarantee you there is an affordability component that will prevent many of them from regular connectivity. Too many of us dont have the sensitivity of that and say things like these people can go to the library to get online.What is your opinion of cities trying to create their own municipal broadband networks? You are being sued by internet service providers for your rules that support municipal broadband.We are waiting for a decision from courts but I wont tiptoe in saying I have been supportive of local communities. If they have reached out to their logical incumbent I.S.P. and if they arent getting what they need from those incumbents and they have the means to build their own infrastructure, I will be supportive of them.Ive been interested in how youve used mergers to help bridge the divide. With Charters merger with Time Warner Cable, the F.C.C. required the company to create a low-income service and to extend its footprint to two million more homes.Every merger should push forward the goals and aspirations of connectivity. We should all want companies and regulators to maximize that goal. I am very pleased by some of the commitments weve gotten from companies who also see benefits of offering a wider array of price points and service.They want customers that would help their bottom lines. We knew it would be the only way for us to truly connect to communities, through public-private partnerships.Whats the best example of how broadband access improves lives?In a pilot project in Ruleville, Mississippi, 100 diabetics used broadband to regularly connect with doctors online. In the first year, none of those patients had hospital visits. It saved $339,000 in Medicaid spending.Google Fiber and new broadband start-ups are going into new cities with a lot of excitement. But they often arent going to low-income neighborhoods. How does this affect the digital divide?I assume those companies making those investments will want to grow and will reach customers they arent reaching at the start.I dont worry that much about them because the community will demand the service.Thats putting a lot of trust in carriers to do the right thing. Their business models clash with your objectives. If those who are left behind cant afford service, how does this help Google or Comcasts business?I dont think there is any business that wants to be perceived as not being a good partner with society.It took a call from you, a federal regulator, to help a high school in Mississippi to get better broadband service. That shows people dont have the power to get better broadband on their own.Is it a perfect system? Heck no. It may have taken that interaction from me, but it will get done. And that is my job. And that is the beauty of having local, state and federal regulators. Yes, it may take some years to get broadband rolled out to all cities, but its going to get done."}
{"text": "LONDON  Rothschild & Company said on Monday it had agreed to acquire Compagnie Financire Martin Maurel in a deal that would unite two long-established family names in French banking.As part of the deal, the companies would combine their private banking and asset-management operations in France to create a private bank with 34 billion euros, or about $39 billion, in assets under management.The transaction values Martin Maurel at 240 million.Under the terms of the deal, Martin Maurel investors would be offered 126 Rothschild shares for each share they own. The Maurel family would receive Rothschild shares in the merger.Our two companies share an independent family model that is a real strength when compared to our competitors, David de Rothschild, the Rothschild chairman, said in a news release. This transaction would strengthen and ensure the continuity of this model.Shares of Rothschild rose about 5 percent to 24.41 in trading in Paris on Monday morning.Martin Maurel traces its roots to 1825, with the founding of Banque Martin Frres. Its main asset is an 88 percent stake in Banque Martin Maurel, a family-owned private bank that employs about 400 people in France.In 2015, Martin Maurel reported net banking income of 102.7 million and had a loan portfolio of about 1 billion.The transaction would be financed through newly issued shares, as well as cash and debt.The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.We believe that the combination of our two groups would strengthen the model of the independent family bank, Bernard Maurel, the Martin Maurel president and chief executive, said. This alliance would enhance our expertise to benefit our clients and our teams, and to face future challenges with confidence.Rothschild is one of the worlds largest independent financial advisory groups, with about 2,800 employees in 40 countries worldwide. It has three main businesses: global financial advisory; private wealth and asset management; and merchant banking.In the 2014-15 fiscal year, the company reported revenue of 1.4 billion.Rothschilds wealth and asset management business had 48.3 billion in assets under management as of the end of September. That included about 10 billion in its French private banking business."}
{"text": "A JUMP IN LAW FIRM SALARIES  |  Cravath, Swaine & Moore, one of the legal industrys most elite law firms, has increased the annual salary for its first-year lawyers to $180,000, from $160,000,\nElizabeth Olson writes in DealBook. Salaries for other associates have also been raised by as much as $35,000 annually, up to $315,000 for associates in their eighth year.This will be good news to junior associates at major law firms, as it will signal to other firms that they should fall in line or lose the best new recruits.  Other high-earning firms are likely to match the salary increases swiftly.The salaries are also a benchmark of how major law firms are faring. Top names like Cravath that have demonstrated winning expertise in areas like litigation or intellectual property have been richly remunerated by clients like IBM and JPMorgan Chase. According to The American Lawyer, an industry publication, Cravath partners each earned, on average, $3.56 million in profits last year.It has been nearly a decade since entry-level lawyer salaries were last increased. During this time, law firms have been buffeted by the economy and corporate clients have increasingly demanded billing discounts and refused to pay steep rates for junior associates to learn on the job. Partner profits have rebounded as corporations continue to use experienced lawyers to handle high-stakes  something that has stirred some dissatisfaction among lower-paid lawyers.The legal website Above the Law reported that associates had raised the issue of salaries with C. Allen Parker, the firms presiding partner, at recent meetings, pointing out that since the last associate pay raise in January 2007,   the cost of living has risen greatly in New York City where most Cravath lawyers work.Still, few law  graduates turn down offers from big companies, so competition for jobs has remained fierce. And although changes to associate compensation at big law firms are closely watched, only a small slice of law graduates begin their practices earning salaries in the mid-$100,000 range.A spokeswoman for Cravath declined to comment further on the move, which had surprised many in the legal world.NATIONAL AMUSEMENTS ALTERS VIACOM BYLAWS TO PREVENT PARAMOUNT SALE  |  National Amusements, the theater chain through which Sumner M. Redstone controls his media empire, said it had altered Viacoms corporate bylaws to prevent the entertainment company from selling any part of Paramount without the approval of the full board,\nMichael J. de la Merced and Emily Steel report in The New York Times.\nNational Amusements holds about a 10 percent stake in Viacom, but nearly 80 percent of the voting stock. This move is likely to delay any sale until the legal disputes are resolved. \nViacom said in February that it was considering a sale of part of Paramount after several buyers expressed their interest. Philippe P. Dauman, Viacoms chief executive, said that a sale would help share the costs of movie productions and improve the studios distribution.\nParamount is a prized asset for Mr. Sumner and he has made known his objections to a deal.  \nCarl Folta, a Viacom spokesman, said, These illegitimate actions stem directly from the invalid changes made to the National Amusements Inc. board and are completely at odds with good corporate governance. A Paramount spokesman declined to comment. \nThe move came after Mr. Dauman waged open warfare against Mr. Redstone, who dismissed Mr. Dauman and another director from the trust that will oversee Mr. Redstones companies. National Amusement said that the decision regarding Paramount was not connected to that dispute and that it wanted to ensure that a sale of any part of Paramount was done as part of a sensible long-term strategy. \n\n\n\nON THE AGENDA   |  Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, will detail the Republican plan to replace the Dodd-Frank Act at the Economic Club of New York at 8 a.m.  Valeant will hold a conference call on its first-quarter earnings and regulatory matters at 8 a.m.   The Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing on bank capital and liquidity regulation at 10 a.m. The Securities and Exchange Commission will hold a meeting to discuss information for bond market investors and financial disclosures at 11 a.m. \n\n\n\nWHO DECIDES FAIR VALUE?  |  When Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster decided that Dell had been sold for $6 billion too little, he highlighted that there had been no higher offer and that that board and its advisers did many praiseworthy things. But he still ordered Dell to pay the shareholders who brought the lawsuit their portion of the difference. \nThe decision sent shudders all over Wall Street and the boardrooms of corporate America because the court had overruled the market,\nAndrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.\nThe decision means that a company doesnt just have a fiduciary duty to find a buyer willing to pay the highest price, because a judge may ultimately deem what the price should be. \nManagement buyouts like the one that Michael Dell pursued are often filled with conflicts, but it is startling that in this case, Mr. Dell and the directors were not found to have done anything underhanded, Mr. Sorkin writes. The judge even went out of his way to say, It bears emphasizing that unlike other situations that this court has confronted, there is no evidence that Mr. Dell or his management team sought to create the valuation disconnect so that they could take advantage of it.\nHe explained that the boards actions might pass muster for purposes of a breach of fiduciary claim and yet still generate a sub-optimal process for purposes of an appraisal. \nMr. Dell appeared to have tried to make the playing field even for bidders, spending more time with the Blackstone Group, which ultimately dropped its bid, than with the winning bid he led.\nThe case now raises questions for deal makers and shareholders about the appropriate way to determine a takeover price. It is also likely to make it harder to complete buyouts. \nThe case is part of a growing trend in which hedge funds and other investors jump into a companys stock after a takeover bid has been announced with the explicit plan of suing companies to claim the price was too low. The practice, known as appraisal arbitrage, is likely to be catapulted even further by this decision. Using courts to negotiate fair value has become a full-time industry for investment funds and lawyers looking for a quick score. \nThe implications are clear, wrote Martin Lipton, the famed takeover lawyer. Private equity firms should be expected to ask whether they face routine appraisal exposure in Delaware, no matter how robust the auction, and therefore seek out alternative transaction structures to cap and price their risk (or exit the market entirely).NATIONAL AMUSEMENTS ALTERS VIACOM BYLAWS TO PREVENT PARAMOUNT SALE  |  National Amusements, the theater chain through which Sumner M.

{"text": "Airport security lines are so long that hundreds of fliers at several airports have reported missing their flights, and the head of the Transportation Security Administration recently warned passengers to continue to expect delays over the summer. While signing up for T.S.A. Precheck, a program that makes preflight risk assessments, is the most common piece of advice to fliers looking to shorten their waits, there are other ways, according to Michael Holtz, the owner of SmartFlyer, a global travel consultancy specializing in airfare. Below, he shares his tips for speeding through airport screening.Pick the Shorter Line. Mr. Holtz said that most airports have two security areas. One of the areas is usually far more crowded than the other because there are more flights going out of the gates near it, he said. Seek out the security screening point thats less busy. Youll likely have to walk farther to get to your gate once you get past security, but youll save time not being held up at security.Navigate the Security Line as You Would a Crowded Bar. Actually getting in an airport security line can waste precious time, he said. There is usually a bottleneck at the beginning of the line because passengers are fumbling around trying to find their IDs and boarding passes, but have yours out and ready to go, and navigate your way to the front of this crowd like you do at a bar when you want to order a drink, he said. Also, another time saver, he said: If you have a boarding pass on your email, take a screenshot of it just in case the Wi-Fi signal at the airport is weak and you cant load it.Pick Your Flight Times Wisely. During the weekdays, avoid travel early in the morning or from 5 to 8 p.m., Mr. Holtz said, because these are the hours when business travelers tend to fly. Also, Saturdays, in general, are a good day to fly to many destinations because leisure travelers usually head out for their trips on Fridays and return on Sundays, and there is limited business travel.Pay the Airlines. For fliers with a more flexible budget, Mr. Holtz said that a handful of carriers in the United States have fee-based programs that help travelers whisk through airport security. Delta, for example, has a separate entrance that is part of Terminal 5 at Los Angeles International Airport where Delta One (business class) passengers can check in and are led through expedited security via a private elevator.American Airlines has a Five Star Service program for first- and business-class customers; its available in 12 domestic airports and five international airports. For a starting price of $250 for the first adult and $75 for each additional adult, services include a curbside meet and greet and priority security screening, where available.JetBlues program is more affordable: Passengers flying out of more than 60 domestic airports can buy an Even More Speed add-on to their ticket for $10, which gives them access to expedited security lanes. The expedited security perk also comes with an Even More Space ticket for a roomier seat."}
{"text": "Here come the lawyers.Last week, the Delaware Court of Chancery handed down a startling decision with broad implications for the future of corporate takeovers: It determined that the board of Dell Inc. sold the company for $6 billion too little when the formerly public company was taken private by a buyout group led by Michael Dell in 2013.What was so surprising about the decision was that the judge in the case, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, highlighted that there had been no higher offer for the company and said that the board and its advisors did many praiseworthy things. Nevertheless, he ordered Dell to pay the shareholders who brought the lawsuit their portion of the difference.The decision is sending shudders all over Wall Street and the boardrooms of corporate America, because the court, in effect, overruled the market. The decision means that companies dont simply have a fiduciary duty to find a buyer willing to pay the highest price, but that a judge may ultimately deem what the price should be.This outcome was applauded by shareholder advocates. And it is likely to lead to a spate of lawsuits and second-guessing over the price of the next big mergers and acquisitions.Management buyouts like the one that Mr. Dell pursued are often filled with conflicts and self-dealing, dynamics that have produced steady fodder for this column. But in this instance, what is particularly startling and noteworthy is that Mr. Dell and the directors were not found to have done anything underhanded. The judge himself went out of his way to say: It bears emphasizing that unlike other situations that this court has confronted, there is no evidence that Mr. Dell or his management team sought to create the valuation disconnect so that they could take advantage of it.Yet Vice Chancellor Laster still decided that based on Dells fair price, the company, which is incorporated in Delaware, was sold for too little. The concept of fair value under Delaware law is not equivalent to the economic concept of fair market value, he wrote. Rather, the concept of fair value for purposes of Delawares appraisal statute is a largely judge-made creation, freighted with policy considerations.The case is part of a growing trend in which hedge funds and other investors jump into a companys stock after a takeover bid has been announced with the explicit plan of suing the companies to claim the price was too low. The practice  one that is likely to be catapulted even further by this decision  is known as appraisal arbitrage.Proponents of appraisal arbitrage will tout the Dell result to encourage the flow of even greater funds into the practice, Martin Lipton, the famed takeover lawyer, wrote in a memo to clients after the decision.The implications are clear: Private equity firms should be expected to ask whether they face routine appraisal exposure in Delaware, no matter how robust the auction, and therefore seek out alternative transaction structures to cap and price their risk (or exit the market entirely), wrote Mr. Lipton, a founding partner of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Oddly enough, one of the firms suing Dell, T. Rowe Price, was deemed to be ineligible to receive a payment because  through a series of technical mistakes  it voted in favor of the transaction. (A shareholder has to vote against the deal to be eligible for a payout.) On Monday, T. Rowe Price said it would make its investors who held Dell shares whole, paying out a total of $194 million.The rules around Delawares appraisal rights of fair value are aimed at helping long-term shareholders protect themselves in instances of self-dealing or other chicanery. In recent years, however, using the courts to negotiate fair value has become a full-time industry for investment funds and lawyers looking for a quick score.Wei Jiang, a professor at Columbia Business School, recently noted in a study that Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III in Delaware had commented in one case that the shareholders bringing the lawsuit were arbitrageurs who bought, not into an ongoing concern, but instead into this lawsuit. Ms. Jiang wrote that the number of appraisal petitions has increased from a trickle of cases in the early 2000s to over 20 a year in recent years, or close to one-quarter of all transactions where appraisal is possible.Whats so peculiar about the Dell decision is that the judge found no chicanery and still didnt think the price was fair, explaining that it was possible a boards actions might pass muster for purposes of a breach of fiduciary claim and yet still generate a sub-optimal process for purposes of an appraisal.Thats not to say that Dells buyout was a model of perfection; no buyout in which the founder is trying to buy shares from the public will ever be conflict-free. Management always has the distinct advantage, and its decision to pursue a deal often makes it harder to attract competing offers. In its ruling, the Chancery cited a column I wrote about this very issue in the Dell case.At the same time, Mr. Dell appears to have genuinely tried to make the playing field even for bidders: He spent more time with the Blackstone Group, which ultimately dropped its bid, than with the winning group he led. And the judge said as much in his decision.All of this raises serious questions for dealmakers and public shareholders: Whats the appropriate way to determine a takeover price? And if the highest bid is not deemed fair  assuming the auction is run competently  what is?Mr. Lipton said he imagined that a private equity buyer might insist on a provision in the merger agreement allowing it to walk away if a small fraction of the shares  1 or 2 percent  perfect appraisal rights.This approach is likely to be unpalatable to selling boards, however, and creates substantial risk that the buyer will exit the transaction when the appraisal cap is exceeded.The courts ruling is likely to make it harder for companies to complete buyouts. That may be a good thing, given that so many shareholders of public companies lose out when the companies they invested in go private and find ways to do substantially better.But if the decision has the chilling effect that some critics fear  making a judge, not the market, the decider of takeover premiums  it could ultimately make the situation for shareholders even worse."}
{"text": "ROME  Italys anti-establishment Five Star Movement moved one step closer to governing Rome on Monday, when returns released from nationwide municipal elections over the weekend took its candidate to a runoff vote in two weeks.A victory for the movement would be a blow to the center-left government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose Democratic Party candidates struggled in the first round of voting in many major Italian cities.The Five Star Movement candidates did particularly well in Rome, where Virginia Raggi received 35.3 percent of the vote, and in Turin, where Chiara Appendino garnered 31 percent. In Rome, Roberto Giachetti, the Democratic Party candidate, reached only 25 percent.We know that Virginia Raggi holds the pink shirt, Mr. Renzi said in a televised news conference on Monday, using a cycling metaphor for a races leader. We still hope Giachetti is going to be successful in his endeavor.The Five Star Movement also made large gains in Romes suburbs. Ms. Raggi, a 37-year-old lawyer, has promised to fight corruption and bring back Romes splendor a year after a wide-reaching scandal exposed criminal infiltration in city bidding contracts.We are facing a historic moment, Ms. Raggi said on Monday. The Romans are ready to turn the page, and I am ready to govern this city and to restore Rome to the splendor and beauty that it deserves.The Democratic Party did not win, but made it to the runoffs in Milan, Turin and Bologna. In Milan, the center-left candidate, Giuseppe Sala, received 42 percent of the vote, slightly more than his center-right opponent, Stefano Parisi.In Turin, the Democratic Party candidate, former Mayor Piero Fassino, won 42 percent of the vote and will face Ms. Appendino in the second round. In Bologna, another traditional bastion of the center-left, the Democratic Party-backed candidate, Virginio Merola, got around 40 percent. He will face a center-right candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni, in the runoff.The center-left party gained little traction in Naples, where the candidate supported by Mr. Renzi, Valeria Valente, reached only 21 percent. Former Mayor Luigi de Magistris, Mr. Renzis independent opponent, will face a runoff against a center-right candidate.We are not happy, Mr. Renzi said. We had wanted to do better, especially in Naples.Yet Mr. Renzi said the Democratic Partys outcome was not linked to his governments stability, or to a national referendum in October on proposed constitutional changes that he hopes will bring greater stability and clarity to voting in the country.I do not believe there is a correlation between the local election and the referendum, Mr. Renzi said, arguing that even those who had chosen a protest vote at the local level would vote in favor of the constitutional changes.Mr. Renzi has pledged to step down if voters do not approve the constitutional overhaul.Giovanni Orsina, a professor of contemporary history at LUISS University in Rome, said the results reflected the same discontent seen in Austrias recent presidential election, in which a far-right candidate narrowly lost.Of course, this is only a preliminary result, and the P.D. did not go too badly, he said, using the Italian abbreviation for the Democratic Party. But the group of its adversaries has shown to be very strong.We now have to see if the discontent is reined in in the runoff or not, Mr. Orsina said."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump found himself on the defensive on Sunday over his claims that he had opposed the intervention in Libya and the war in Iraq.Mr. Trump has described himself in the presidential campaign as an ardent detractor of both interventions, but his critics cite evidence to the contrary.In an interview on CBSs Face the Nation, the host, John Dickerson, pointed out that Mr. Trump had supported military intervention in Libya and the ouster of its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, despite the fact he now criticizes Hillary Clinton on both points.When you say supported it, I supported Libya? Mr. Trump said.Yes, you supported the intervention in Libya, Mr. Dickerson replied.I did? Where do you see that? Mr. Trump asked.Mr. Dickerson played a video clip from 2011 of Mr. Trump saying: Now, we should go in. We should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it and save these lives.Mr. Trump insisted that the comments had not constituted support. I was for doing something, he said, but I wasnt for what you have right now.The candidate also told Jake Tapper, the host of CNNs State of the Union, that there was ample evidence that he had been against the Iraq war. But in an interview with the radio host Howard Stern before the invasion of 2003, the real estate developer expressed support for it.Asked in the 2002 interview whether he supported invading Iraq, Mr. Trump replied: Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.Mr. Trump also acknowledged that he had made a lot of money with Qaddafi, telling Face the Nation viewers that when the Libyan dictator was preparing to attend a United Nations summit meeting in 2009, he was looking for a property large enough to accommodate the Bedouin-style tent he planned to use. The Libyan leader rented a Westchester property that belonged to Mr. Trump.He had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay, and he paid me a fortune, never got to stay there, Mr. Trump said of Colonel Qaddafi. And it became sort of a big joke. But the fact is that Libya was a disaster, from the standpoint of the way it was handled."}
{"text": "Phyllis Curtin, an American soprano celebrated as a champion of new music, died on Sunday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 94.Her death was confirmed by the Finnerty & Stevens Funeral Home in Great Barrington.A mainstay of the New York City Opera in the 1950s and 60s, Ms. Curtin was noted for the purity of her voice, the sensitivity of her musical phrasing and the crystalline perfection of her diction. On the opera stage and in recital, she gave the premieres of dozens of works by 20th-century composers  more first, and last, performances than any singer in history, as she was fond of saying, ruefully.But she sang many works with staying power, including music by Benjamin Britten, Ned Rorem and the American composer Carlisle Floyd, for whom she created the title role in Susannah, his most famous opera, in a performance at Florida State University in Tallahassee in 1955.In the standard repertoire, Ms. Curtin was widely praised for her Mozart  she sang all of his major heroines over time  and for the title role in Richard Strausss Salome.Her other notable roles included Violetta in La Traviata and Alice Ford in Falstaff, both by Verdi; Ellen Orford in Brittens Peter Grimes; the title role in Darius Milhauds Mde; and Cathy in Mr. Floyds Wuthering Heights, a part she created at the Santa Fe Opera in 1958.Ms. Curtin also sang at the Metropolitan Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Vienna State Opera, Covent Garden and La Scala. She appeared in concert with the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and other major ensembles.In later years she taught voice at Yale and Boston Universities and at Tanglewood, where she held a sought-after master class each summer for more than half a century.Though Ms. Curtins singing was esteemed by critics and opera aficionados, she remained less well known than contemporary sopranos like Beverly Sills and Joan Sutherland. She performed with the Met just 35 times in the 1960s and 70s, and recorded far less than many of her peers.Writing in The New York Times in 1998, Anthony Tommasini described Ms. Curtin as an estimable American soprano, who has achieved notable success and respect throughout the field but never quite the recognition she deserves.The reasons for this seem to reflect the difficulties faced by many American opera singers of Ms. Curtins era, when a European background was considered the sine qua non for landing contracts with major United States companies.What was more, as Ms. Curtin told it, her career was hindered by a set of backstage machinations as Machiavellian as anything in opera.Phyllis Jane Smith was born on Dec. 3, 1921, in Clarksburg, W.Va. Her mother was an organist and choir director at a local church; growing up, Phyllis studied violin and ballet.At Wellesley, from which she earned a bachelors degree in political science in 1943, the young Ms. Curtin began studying voice in earnest. Her early teachers included the soprano Olga Averino and the bass Joseph Regneas.She envisioned herself as a recitalist  a song-singer, she liked to say  but fell into opera early. As a student at Tanglewood in 1946, she sang a small role in the United States premiere of Peter Grimes, under Leonard Bernstein.Her early operatic work also included appearances with the New England Opera Theater in Boston, where she sang Lisa in Tchaikovskys Queen of Spades and Lady Billows in Brittens Albert Herring, among other roles.Ms. Curtin gave her New York recital debut at Town Hall in 1950 in a characteristically eclectic program that featured songs by Mozart, Faur, Ravel, Mussorgsky and several Latin American composers.Reviewing the performance, The New York Times said: Miss Curtins voice is altogether lovely in quality, and is used with equal assurance throughout its entire range. But her concern was so exclusively with communication that one was conscious only of the music itself.She made her first appearance with City Opera in 1953, singing three roles in the United States premiere of The Trial, an adaptation of Kafkas novel by the Austrian composer Gottfried von Einem. The debut was well received, as was her subsequent work with the company, but it was not until City Opera staged Susannah in 1956, with Ms. Curtin again in the title role, that her reputation was truly made.Based on the biblical story of Susanna and the Elders, the opera, set in rural Tennessee, centers on a communitys condemnation of a sensual young woman and the tragic consequences that ensue. It went on to become one of the most frequently performed American operas, and Susannah became the character with which Ms. Curtin was most closely identified.Yet operatic superstardom eluded her. She may have been hindered by her voice, which, though almost universally praised for its purity, was not as immense as large opera houses can demand. She may have been tarred, too, by her association with 20th-century music, typically a hard sell to audiences.Where we make our big mistake is in thinking that all opera is Tosca and that everything else is something beyond the pale, Ms. Curtin said in an interview with The Times in 1961. A new musical show on Broadway gets plenty of attention, but some sort of ridiculous barrier has been set up between the musical and the opera.Ms. Curtin made her Met debut in 1961 as Fiordiligi in Mozarts Cos Fan Tutte. (Now Phyllis Curtin is at the Met, where she should have been a long time ago, The New York Herald Tribune wrote.)But after that, the companys imperious general manager, Rudolf Bing, engaged her only occasionally.Youll never sing Tosca here because youre not Italian, she recalled his having told her in the late 60s. (In 1973, she sang the role with the Met in performances in Staten Island, Queens and the Bronx, her last appearances with the company.)Even more painful than her dealings with the Met was a rupture with City Opera in 1966, which Ms. Curtin called the only heartbreaking thing in my career.The company had been planning to stage Handels Julius Caesar, with the role of Cleopatra going to Ms. Curtin. Then Ms. Sills, in her 30s and a City Opera regular though not yet a huge star, demanded the role for herself. She threatened to rent Carnegie Hall and present a competing program of arias from the opera if the company did not relent.The company relented. Thats when the knife went into my back, Ms. Curtin told The Times in 1972. After my life at the City Opera, which had always been successful for me and the company, I simply couldnt believe that my family would do that to me.Ms. Sills, who later said she regretted the episode, sang the role to immense acclaim. It was said to have made her career.Ms. Curtin, who continued to perform well into her 60s despite having developed painful rheumatoid arthritis in her mid-40s, taught at Yale during the 1970s and early 80s. In 1983 she became the dean of Boston Universitys School for the Arts, a post she held until 1991, when she retired from the deanship but continued teaching there.Starting in the mid-1960s, she taught for 51 years at Tanglewood, where her students included the future opera stars Dawn Upshaw, Cheryl Studer and Simon Estes.Ms. Curtins first marriage, to Philip D. Curtin, a historian, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Eugene Cook, a photojournalist whom she married in 1956, died in 1986. Survivors include a daughter, Claudia dAlessandro, from her second marriage, and three grandchildren.Her discography includes La Chanson dEve, comprising Faurs settings of poems by Paul Verlaine; Beethovens Ninth Symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner; and Shostakovichs Symphony No. 14.Ms. Curtin was by all accounts an undivalike diva, and though she maintained a deep regard for the music she sang, she did not appear to take the operatic life too seriously. In an interview with The Herald Tribune in 1964, for instance, she set forth her modus operandi for kindling theatrical passion:When I come out onstage I give the tenor a loving, seductive look, she said. If he turns and runs  oh, well, I have to do it all myself. If he blushes and hesitates and then shapes up  well, well worry about it later."}
{"text": "Early in the Season 2 premiere, Rachel pulls up to the Everlasting house with Darius, this seasons suitor. He balks. And so Rachel does what she does so well  she goes hunting, looking for anything that will bring him in line: resentment, Dariuss embarrassment at participating, his mothers opinion of it all. Finally, she offers this line: This does not make you who you are.If you watched the first season of UnREAL, you already know thats the emptiest sentiment this world can provide.Last summer, Lifetime surprised with this relentless, darkly comic behind-the-scenes power game. A former Bachelor producer Sarah Gertrude Shapiro and the veteran TV producer Marti Noxon propped their dual character study against a backdrop of wobbly TV-production minutiae and a profound examination of power. Amid cinematography that toggled between godlike oversight and murder-mystery close-ups, Shiri Appleby and Constance Zimmer delivered two of the years best performances.Its an unsettling show; the composer Fil Eislers minor-key phrases act as a constant reminder that its point-of-view characters are the villains  a rare situation for women on TV. That doesnt fundamentally alter the moral metrics of the show, either; it just encourages a little healthy cynicism. Darius, whos trying to fix a P.R. problem, is equal parts fickle and ripe for redemption. Several of the contestants have potential but are frustratingly two-dimensional, and we know only a few will break out from the pack.Theyll have to wait. In War, everyone exists to reflect Rachel and Quinn. This can seem facile for a show whose protagonists are so calculatingly layered; a sacrifice of anyone whose qualms might slow down the steamrollers. Dr. Wagerstein tattles about Rachels mother staying in touch with Jeremy, Rachels cameraman ex. Jeremy gets the chance to stir up a personality (something last season didnt manage) with a vendetta against Rachel so pointed shes speechless in the face of it. And Jay, one of the producers, seems to have reset his Aghast Meter after all his scheming last season. Its less a character arc than the feeling there needs to be someone whos morally uncomfortable.This show isnt subtle. It proves Chets repulsiveness by making him an alumnus of a kind of mens rights boot camp; Rachel barks: We dont solve problems, O.K.? We create them, and then we point cameras at them. But honestly, UnREAL doesnt need subtlety  it has commitment. It draws its power from how deep its willing to sink its teeth.Its here all that mirroring starts to matter. For Rachel in particular, the struggle to run her show amid Quinns power games is already getting to her. One of the contestants is hot Rachel, self-confident and infuriatingly even-keeled. And theres Madison, a new producer who viscerally evokes Rachel before the fall. In the episodes standout scene, Madison delivers Rachels interview prompts to a grief-stricken contestant in order to get their sound bite. Madisons tears, guilty vomiting and vicious glee are as close to Rachels origin flashback as well ever need. (The reaction shot in the production truck suggests Rachel knows shes making a monster; it wont stop her.)Quinn has arguably treated Rachel worse than anyone else  and better than anyone else. Its a shame they already got matching tattoos, since the clear front-runner motto for their relationship is: Dont sell me, O.K.? The energy between Zimmer and Appleby creates a dynamic as crucial as it is toxic. Theyre each others ideal audience, and the painful honesty they sling at each other is the shows beating heart. (When Quinn eases a tray of cocaine from under Rachels nose, her protectiveness is so unexpected it feels like a plot twist.) To Rachel, Quinn represents the promise that she can close the divide between what she wants and who she is. The shows floating the idea she might have nothing underneath her ambition. To Quinn, Rachel is the reassurance that everyone crumbles eventually and finds something waiting; shes the promise that this is not who you are.If theres a meta subtext to the fact of needing a particular audience, thats all right; this shows fourth wall is permeable enough to withstand a little pressure. This season of The Bachelorette is aware of the post-Everlasting world; in retaliation, its used its contestants  like the wall-punching Chad  to weaponize meta. (Alex, a former Marine, announced that Chad was crafting a beautiful disaster story for himself.) For UnREAL, though, its impossible to avoid feeling referential, and wisely it doesnt try. Instead, the series feeds us knowing asides that act more as character beats than exposition.When Quinn answers network fears about last season with a sharp dismissal  What does he want us to do? Kill someone every episode?  its designed to remind us of Rachels breaking point. It also suggests that for all of her guilt, Quinn probably sleeps better than Rachel. But its also a reminder of TVs feedback loop. The stakes have to climb, and when your baseline is as wild as the shows previous season, a free-fall is likely in the making. Abandon hope, all ye who enter. Its going to be great."}

{"text": "The N.F.L. became the latest victim in a string of recent high-profile Twitter hoaxes and hackings after its verified account sent a series of tweets saying that Roger Goodell, the leagues commissioner, had died.We regret to inform our fans that our commissioner, Roger Goodell, has passed away. He was 57. #RIP, the hoax tweet read.Initially a flurry of posts expressing shock of the death went up after the tweet about Mr. Goodell, a polarizing figure in his 10 years as commissioner.But others, battle-worn from days of recent Twitter hoaxes targeting celebrities like Jack Black, Mark Zuckerberg, Katy Perry and Drake quickly turned skeptical: Something just didnt seem quite right about this one.The tweet was quickly deleted  but the hacker (or hackers) doubled down.Oi, I said Roger Goodell has died, an insistent follow-up tweet read. Dont delete that tweet.The N.F.L. Twitter account was hacked, Brian McCarthy, the leagues vice president of communications, said in an email. He added, We have engaged law enforcement to look into the matter. We are reviewing and strengthening our cybersecurity measures.Mr. Goodell jokingly weighed in with a post on his personal Twitter account hours later.Mr. Goodell most likely wont be the last victim of what seems to be a spree of hackings committed by people who appear to be using leaked data to gain access to myriad social media accounts.Indeed, minutes after the N.F.L. account was hacked, suspicious tweets began emanating from the singer Lana Del Reys account. (Like those sent from the N.F.L., those tweets were quickly deleted.)While the N.F.L. hoax was deliberately used to spread bad information, the apparent breach against Ms. Del Rey resulted in the posting of gibberish and offensive statements similar to those in other hacks, including the one against Ms. Perry.In a statement about the hacks, Twitter said: A number of other online services have seen millions of passwords stolen in the past several weeks, and we know far too many people use the same password for multiple things online. We recommend people to use a unique, strong password for Twitter.Its hard to say if the hoaxes were part of a coordinated attack on high-profile accounts, but the rapid-fire timing would suggest some planning. The millions of account names and passwords leaked in data breaches of social media platforms, including LinkedIn and Myspace, suggested that hackers are targeting accounts for which one password was used for multiple accounts.In May, LinkedIn said that hackers were attempting to sell what they claimed were 117 million email addresses and passwords of its users, suggesting that a data breach in 2012 was much larger than initially thought.Its quite possible that the LinkedIn breach is to blame again, Graham Cluley, an online security expert and consultant, wrote in an email about the N.F.L. hoax. Fundamental truth is that too many people reuse passwords, or have failed to enable two-step verification on their Twitter accounts.Further complicating the N.F.L. hoax was the fact that the hackers had breached an organizations verified account, where death notices are frequently posted to a curious public.One easy way to spot a hoax on Twitter is to check if the tweet had been posted using a different social media application than is usually used for that account. The N.F.L. usually tweets using social applications like Spredfast. The hoax tweet came from Twitters web client.For their part, the hackers quickly responded when they realized theyd been caught: OK, OK, you amateur detectives win. Good job."}
{"text": "A writer struggling with a story finds himself unexpectedly assaulted by two men with pistols and a pizza delivery woman wielding a cleaver. They all have the same demand: a new tale. Ill bet this doesnt happen to Philip Roth. Or Amos Oz, the writer (Kenneth Talberth) complains. He is probably right.Suddenly, a Knock at the Door, at Theater for the New City, is based on a collection of stories by the Polish-Israeli writer Etgar Keret, a proponent of darkly whimsical magical realism. The opening, which is borrowed from the book and positions the piece as a cracked, contemporary One Thousand and One Nights, has a certain wild confidence. But the ensuing play, adapted by Robin Goldfin and directed by David L. Carson, emphasizes the difficulty of translating prose works for the stage.In many of the scenes, the words simply dont leap far enough off the page. One of the men who threatens the writer tells him, Work that imagination of yours, brother, invent something  let it flow, but too many of the scenes betray their short-story form. Rather than transmuting the stories into dialogue and action, the script has an over-reliance on direct address and observation. Mr. Goldfins ways of tying the stories together too often show the seams.As if to compensate, Mr. Carson has encouraged his actors to emote as though their lives depended on it, and not all are up to the task. The tone and pacing are too consistently hectic, the characterizations quite broad. But the two onstage musicians are a fine touch, providing underscoring sound effects and occasional commentary with their acoustic guitars. And the show does manage to convey Mr. Kerets casually mordant worldview, his sense that fiction so often palls before the quiet and terrible absurdities of everyday life."}

Part of this problem, as it is for many Broadway shows, is simple economics: The demand for tickets exceeds the number of seats in the theater on a given night.But there is another significant factor exacerbating this problem that is unfair to customers, and that lawmakers in Albany can help us solve.Many would-be customers complain that tickets to their favorite shows, concerts and sporting events are sold out within minutes  if not seconds  after they are posted for sale.So how is it that you cant get through to Ticketmaster on the phone or online, and yet resale sites like StubHub or Vivid Seats instantly have tickets available at sky-high prices? Are they luckier than you or your neighbor? Can they dial faster? Is StubHub the lucky Sky Masterson to your hapless Nathan Detroit?No. The issue is the widespread use of special automated software called ticket bots by third-party brokers, which Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, discovered earlier this year during an investigation. His findings are detailed in a report called Obstructed View: Whats Blocking New Yorkers From Getting Tickets. Brokers use bots to connect at lightning speed and gobble up as many hot tickets as possible, then offer them on legal resale sites like StubHub.The investigation confirmed that tens of thousands of tickets to New York events are acquired each year using such software. Brokers who buy tickets using bots substantially mark up the prices  sometimes by more than 1,000 percent  yielding enormous profits.Incredibly, ticket bots are already illegal under New York law and their use is subject to civil penalties (the attorney general recently announced that large fines were leveled against six brokers). But the markup on resale tickets is so lucrative, earning brokers millions of dollars per year, that they happily risk prosecution and treat civil penalties as the cost of business.To use another metaphor from Guys and Dolls: Big Julie is using loaded dice, and you and I do not have a chance. Tickets are taken out of circulation, punishing people who cant afford to pay more than face value. The extra money doesnt provide a better concert or show experience for you, the fan. Instead, it goes straight to the brokers bottom line.The problem will persist until we strengthen the existing law and make this recurrent illegal behavior a felony. In late April, Mr. Schneiderman proposed a bill to address rampant illegal use of bots.In response, the full State Senate unanimously passed a bill making it illegal for ticket brokers to knowingly resell or offer to resell tickets purchased using bots and requiring ticket resale platforms like StubHub to post the price they paid for tickets on their platform so that consumers can easily see the markup price. Most important, since brokers dont seem dissuaded by fines, the bill creates criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for repeat offenders.The New York Assembly is discussing these measures for a similar bill sponsored by Marcos Crespo, a Democratic assemblyman from the Bronx. The Assembly should pass the bill and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo can sign it into law.I want the thousands of tickets for shows, concerts and sporting events that are now purchased by bots and resold at higher prices to go into the general market so that you have a chance to get them. I want theatergoers to be able to purchase tickets at face value at our box office and our website, rather than on a resale platform. And if you do go to a resale platform for tickets, I want the markup you must pay to be clearly displayed.Most of all, I want you to be there when the curtain goes up. You shouldnt have to fight robots just to see something you love."}
{"text": "BALTIMORE  The police officer charged with murder in the death of Freddie Gray chose on Monday to have a bench trial, eliminating a jury from his emotionally charged case and placing the verdict in the hands of the same judge who acquitted another officer two weeks ago.The officer, Caesar R. Goodson Jr., a veteran of Baltimores police force, was driving the police wagon that Mr. Gray, a 25-year-old black man, was riding in when he suffered the spinal injury that killed him. Mr. Grays death, in April 2015, led to violent protests in the city and became a cornerstone of the nations wrenching debate over the way police officers use force against minorities.Just over a year ago, the citys top prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, charged six officers in the arrest and death of Mr. Gray  a move that effectively calmed the city but has yet to yield any convictions. The presiding judge, Barry G. Williams, granted each officer a separate trial. The first, of Officer William G. Porter, ended in December with a hung jury and led to months of delays. In the second trial, last month, Officer Edward M. Nero was acquitted by Judge Williams.Officer Goodson faces the most serious charge  second-degree murder  in Mr. Grays death. His trial, which begins Thursday, will be watched closely in a city where many residents have hoped for a conviction in the case.You are waiving your right to have a jury trial, do you understand that? Judge Williams asked as he peered at Officer Goodson from the bench during a pretrial hearing in his cavernous courtroom on Monday.Yes, Officer Goodson replied, softly.Legal experts said Judge Williamss acquittal of Officer Nero on May 23 weighed heavily in Officer Goodsons decision to avoid a jury trial.You put all your eggs in one basket when you elect to have a court trial instead of a 12-member jury, said Warren S. Alperstein, a defense lawyer who has watched the cases against the officers.But keep in mind, Mr. Alperstein added, that this is a very highly emotionally charged case, and theres a risk that a jury would not be able to separate the emotion or ignore the emotion in this case, whereas Judge Williams has just demonstrated that he is able to.Officer Goodson, 47, had been a Baltimore police officer for 17 years when he responded to the arrest of Mr. Gray in West Baltimores blighted Sandtown neighborhood last year. Mr. Gray had fled, unprompted, from police officers, who later placed him in Officer Goodsons transport wagon. Mr. Gray was not secured by a seatbelt.With Officer Goodson at the wheel, the wagon made a series of stops in the neighborhood; when it arrived at the Western District police station, Mr. Gray was unresponsive and no longer breathing. He died a week later from a functionally severed spinal cord.Officer Goodson, who is black, also faces charges of manslaughter and second-degree assault. Court filings have hinted that prosecutors may argue that Officer Goodson intentionally drove the van dangerously, taking Mr. Gray for a so-called rough ride.Prosecutors are also expected to argue that Officer Goodson displayed an extreme indifference to human life, and that it was his duty to secure Mr. Gray in a seatbelt and to obtain medical attention when asked.Judge Williams dealt a potential blow to that argument on Monday by granting a defense motion to preclude the testimony of a detective who said Officer Porter had told her that Mr. Gray said he could not breathe during the van ride.A small group of demonstrators who gathered outside the courthouse were dismayed to learn Officer Goodson would be tried by a judge.The decision is devastating, said the Rev. Cortly Witherspoon, known as C.D., the president of Baltimores chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The citizens of this city were robbed of the opportunity to decide what happens with Officer Goodson."}
{"text": "An aggressive campaign to recruit graduate students from India to study at Western Kentucky University has ended badly, with more than one-third of the students asked to leave the program after their first semester, a university official said.The university used international recruiters to find the students, compensating the services based on how many students they enrolled. The outcome, which will force the students to return to India or find placement in another university or program in the United States, illustrates a pitfall of using such recruiters.James Gary, the chairman of Western Kentuckys computer science program, said on Monday that almost 40 of the students did not meet the requirements of their admissions, even though they were offered remedial help by the university.While some students will be allowed to remain, Mr. Gary said, at least 25 of the nearly 60 students in the program must leave.Permitting the students to continue in the program would be throwing good money after bad, he said, because they were unable to write computer programs, a necessary part of the curriculum and a skill that United States schools teach to undergraduates.If they come out of here without the ability to write programs, thats embarrassing to my department, Mr. Gary said, explaining why the university could not permit them to continue.The chairman of the Indian Student Association at Western Kentucky University, Aditya Sharma, expressed concern for the students.I definitely feel badly for these students, said Mr. Sharma, a graduate student in public health administration. Theyve come so far. Theyve invested money into it.But he said some of the students had adopted what he called a casual approach to their studies. They could not meet their G.P.A., so the university had to take this decision, Mr. Sharma said.Some of the students are seeking placement in graduate schools in Missouri and Tennessee, Mr. Sharma said. Others are considering applying to less rigorous programs than the one at Western Kentucky, in Bowling Green, Ky.Those who are not able to find placement will be forced to leave the country under the terms of their visas.The students had been admitted in January after a recruitment campaign in India last summer and fall. Recruiters in India had run advertisements offering spot admission to the university, as well as tuition discounts.When faculty members at Western Kentucky learned last fall that some of the students did not meet admissions standards, the university Senate endorsed a resolution expressing concern about the recruitment campaign, part of the universitys efforts to lift enrollment and revenue in the face of deep state budget cuts.Western Kentucky said in a statement on Monday that the university had altered its international recruitment efforts in India. In addition to reviewing its advertising, the school is sending members of the computer science faculty to India to meet with students before offers of admission are made.Under the terms of the universitys agreement with the recruiter, the company was to be paid about $2,000 per student, but it would not collect all of that money unless the student remained for two semesters.A survey released last week by Bridge Education Group and StudentMarketing showed that 37 percent of universities and colleges in the United States work with international recruitment agencies, a majority of which are paid by commission."}
{"text": "Reports a few years ago that global banks manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, to reap profits on their investments showed how easy it was to manipulate benchmarks used to set rates for trillions of dollars in mortgages, student loans and other financial products. Tell a few lies about the interest rates, and then watch the profits roll in  sounds like a classic fraud if ever there was one.Whether traders who tried to push their banks Libor submissions to favor their positions actually violated the federal wire fraud statute will be a central question as two defendants challenge convictions and the Justice Department pursues new charges against two former traders at Deutsche Bank.The Libor scandal exploded in July 2012, when Barclays admitted to submitting false information used to set the interest rate benchmark and paid about $450 million in fines and civil penalties. The banks chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., soon lost his job. Since then, five other banks have resolved cases over their role in rigging Libor, including Deutsche Bank, which paid $775 million and entered into a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department while its London-based subsidiary pleaded guilty to wire fraud.Two traders at Deutsche Bank, Matthew Connolly and Gavin Campbell Black, were indicted last week on conspiracy and wire fraud charges for their role in manipulating the submissions used to set Libor. As in many cases involving traders, the government highlighted messages showing how unabashed they were in pushing for the bank to submit an interest rate that would help their investment positions.In one exchange, Mr. Connolly emailed the person responsible for submitting the banks information  using the typically clipped terminology that traders favor  asking that if possible, we need in NY 1 mo libor as low as possible next few days  tons of pays coming up over all  thanks! The response came back, Will do our best Matt.That kind of exchange makes it hard to deny there was an intent to make a false submission on behalf of Deutsche Bank.The latest charges follow the pattern set in an indictment filed in 2014 against traders at Rabobank for manipulating its yen Libor submissions. Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti were convicted last November of conspiracy and wire fraud. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced Mr. Allen to two years in prison, while Mr. Conti received a punishment of a year and a day in prison. They remain free on bail pending appeal.Judge Rakoff rejected their argument to overturn the guilty verdicts. The defendants argued that the interest rates submitted to the British Bankers Association, which set Libor at the time, were not false or misleading because they reflected rates that could have been accurate. The judge found that the defendants effectively represented that they were responding in good faith to the B.B.A.s query about the rate at which Rabobank could borrow funds.A jury could reasonably find that defendants gave counterparties the false impression that they were making good-faith estimates of Rabobanks borrowing costs instead of making Libor submissions to benefit Rabobanks trading positions, Judge Rakoff explained.A recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, which will review the convictions, may present the Justice Department with a substantial hurdle to show the Libor submissions were sufficient to support a conviction for wire fraud.In that case, which I wrote about last week, the appeals court overturned a jury verdict finding that Bank of America violated the wire fraud statute for selling questionable mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that fell well short of the contractual requirements for the loans to be sold.Judge Rakoff also presided over that case, finding that the bank had engaged in a brazen fraud. But the appeals court reached the opposite conclusion, finding that a breach of contract, standing alone, would be insufficient to constitute a fraud absent an affirmative misstatement at the time of the sale of the mortgages.That analysis is sure to be seized on by lawyers for Mr. Allen and Mr. Conti to argue that even if their efforts to influence the interest rate submission were successful, it was not the type of misstatement sufficient for a wire fraud conviction.The question asked of the 16 banks that helped set Libor was, At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 a.m.? The B.B.A. then threw out the four highest and lowest figures it received, and used the mean of the remaining eight to set Libor for that day.No particular bank could move the rate on its own, and there was not a contractual obligation to supply an exact figure, only a rate at which it could borrow funds  a process that is inherently subjective.Each banks Libor submission carried an implicit assertion that it was an accurate figure at which it could borrow if it so desired. But whether that implication, which can result in a false impression about the true borrowing costs of a bank, constitutes wire fraud is an open question when a knowing breach of contract itself was insufficient to prove a violation by Bank of America.The Libor rate submissions can be viewed as an affirmative statement by Rabobank and Deutsche Bank about the proper interest rate, which may be enough to distinguish the prosecution of Mr. Allen and Mr. Conti from the Bank of America case in which flawed loans were sold without any claim about compliance with the contract. Moreover, evidence of the purpose to enhance the value of the banks portfolio by making misleading submissions is abundantly clear in the various messages exchanged by the traders, so the proof of a strong profit motive may be enough to support the wire fraud charges.If the convictions of Mr. Allen and Mr. Conti are overturned, however, it would undermine the case against Mr. Connolly and Mr. Black while dealing a substantial blow to the Justice Departments efforts to crack down on individual traders involved in Libor manipulation. The oral arguments in the appeal will be heard later this year, which means a decision should not be expected until 2017.The banks involved in setting Libor received a dose of bad news two weeks ago when the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district courts dismissal of class-action lawsuits for violation of the antitrust laws. Because the cases were thrown out at an early stage, the appeals court had to accept the claims of the plaintiffs as true for deciding whether to let them proceed.The crucial claim was that the banks engaged in a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy to artificially affect Libor, which the courts have found to be a per se violation of the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the district courts conclusion that the plaintiffs could not show any injury, finding that they have alleged an anticompetitive tendency: the warping of market factors affecting the prices for Libor-based financial instrument.The lawsuits were returned to the lower court for further proceedings, which is likely to mean protracted discovery that will drag out for years. The danger to the banks from the antitrust claims is the potential for triple damages for any violation, which means the cost to settle a lawsuit may be much higher as the case moves forward.The evidence developed by the Justice Department showing how traders tried to manipulate Libor is copious, and in some instances they coordinated with their counterparts at other banks to generate profits.But just showing a desire to make money by manipulating Libor may not be enough to prove wire fraud, strange as that may seem, even if the banks may be liable for antitrust violations."}

Bernie Sanders vowed to fight on, hoping a win in California might prompt superdelegates to defect to him.______2. Donald Trump  said his comments about a Hispanic judge  suggesting he would not be able to handle a case against the now-closed Trump University fairly because of his heritage  had been misconstrued. Mr. Trump spoke after Speaker Paul Ryan, above, called Mr. Trumps criticism the textbook definition of a racist comment and absolutely unacceptable.______3. Indias prime minister, Narendra Modi, goaded by concern over a possible Trump presidency, showcased an unusually cooperative approach on his second visit to the White House in two years. He took crucial steps toward ratifying the Paris climate accord and finishing the purchase of nuclear reactors, with a military deal to come. Modi wants to get as much as he can out of Obamas last months in office, an analyst said.______4. More than 350,000 people have signed a petition for the recall of a California judge who sentenced this Stanford University student, Brock Turner, to only six months in jail after he was convicted of sexual assault. The victims 7,000-word cry for justice, published after the sentencing, has been viewed more than 8.5 million times.______5. Muhammad Ali died just as a foundation devoted to the photographer Gordon Parks was preparing to exhibit some of his images of the boxer.

In a rare victory against prison abuses, five New York City correction officers were convicted of all charges in the beating of a Rikers Island inmate in 2012. The inmate testified that he was punched, kicked and stomped, and spat up blood for months. Several more accused officers are to hear their verdict on Friday. Regrettably, some people think of prisoners as less than human, said a lawyer.______8. The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, swore to retake every inch of territory lost in six years of civil war. His defiant address offered no hope that he would back a revival of talks to find a political solution. Meanwhile, U.N. officials said the Syrian authorities had delayed approval for desperately needed food aid for civilians trapped in a rebel-held area near the capital.______9. Finally, the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who suffers from a form of Lou Gehrigs disease, made a significant addition to his groundbreaking work on black holes.

{"text": "Identity. Look hard  and then harder  at that word until it wavers, fragments and dissolves before your eyes, and you begin to wonder if it amounts to anything other than an assemblage of diversely shaped letters that might as well be runes. Its enough to give you a headache, isnt it?Well, thats sort of the experience of watching Branden Jacobs-Jenkinss War, a portrait of family as a state of civil conflict that opened on Monday night at the Claire Tow Theater at Lincoln Center. This is a heavily confused play about cultural confusion, a consideration of identity  racial, social, political, anthropological, even biological  that never settles into a coherent identity of its own.You could call it a casualty of the very existential maladies it investigates. And it seems fitting that it should befall a work by Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins, who is both one of the most exciting young dramatists working today and one of the hardest to categorize. His specialty is the ambiguity of self, particularly as defined by skin color, and the futility as well as the necessity of looking for solid answers.To explore this knotty subject, Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins has taken such radically different approaches that it would be hard to immediately determine the authorship of his individual plays if his name werent on them. His works have included a satisfyingly cynical thriller, about murder in the workplace (Gloria, a Pulitzer Prize finalist this year), and a genre-bending detonation of a 19th-century melodrama about interracial love (the brilliant An Octoroon).Then theres Neighbors, a self-described epic with cartoons about a blackface-wearing black family, and Appropriate, about a white family with an oppressive past, which seemed to borrow from just about every classic American drama of domestic dysfunction. The one thing these works have in common is a cool and canny authorial distance, a sense of an observer with a merciless eye for human inconsistencies.In War, directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz (who also staged an earlier version at the Yale Repertory Theater in 2014), it feels as if this writer has for once entered the fray directly, and lost his footing. The story of a divided clan uneasily united around the hospital deathbed of its matriarch, it may well be Mr. Jacobs-Jenkinss most far-reaching statement about how the hunt for identity strands and estranges people, even from those they should be closest to.But it is so replete with ideas and arguments  and tries to cover so much territory within a confined space  that it chokes on its ambitions. Not that many of the ideas, and the various ways in which theyre presented, arent provocative in themselves.There is, for example, the matter of the apes, or alphas, as they prefer to call themselves. They inhabit the limbo-land wherein Roberta (the luminous Charlayne Woodard in gracious hostess mode) finds herself after having a stroke. Her body may be in a Washington hospital, but her spirit inhabits this planet of the apes. And it is here that she must rediscover who and what she was, from the very beginning.At the same time, in the real world by that hospital bed, Robertas contentious children  Tate (Chris Myers), a prickly gay political consultant, and Joanne (Rachel Nicks), a stay-at-home mom married to the white Malcolm (Reggie Gowland)  are squabbling over what to do about Mom. Their fight is further stoked by the presence of an addled, non-English-speaking stranger, Elfriede (a touching Michele Shay).Elfriede is accompanied by her grown son, Tobias (a bellicose Austin Durant), who acts as his mothers interpreter. Thus we learn that Elfriede is a member of the family, the product of a wartime affair between Robertas father and a German woman.Now consider the conflicted levels of time and place that Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins has thrown into play here. We have the ancestral oblivion of ape limbo, in which Roberta is lost; the despoiled Germany of the 1940s, in which her father was an exotic alien (the Germans made monkey noises when they saw him); and the fractious present, in which even brother and sister cannot connect.Why is everything some war in this family!? asks a tearful Joanne, after an especially nasty blowout with the arrogant Tate. Everything is a part of some struggle that seems like its never going to end  that no one even understands!That is perhaps the bluntest declaration of the central theme here. But War doesnt lack for other blunt declarations and for long and winding passages of exposition that cover the same patches of family history again and again. (The spectral Roberta has to recreate her entire life story with her ape friends, embodied by the rest of the cast and led by Lance Coadie Williams, who doubles as a sassy hospital nurse.)Now you could argue that modern playwrights have always had a penchant for turning family grievances into repeated litanies. Look at Eugene ONeills Long Days Journey Into Night or Stephen Karams The Humans (both currently on Broadway) or any of Edward Albees domestic dramas.The difference is that here Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins uses such repetition not to convey psychological character but to make sociological points. He is unusual among first-rate playwrights in that his empathy seems largely abstract. He understands his characters, but you dont feel he connects with them. And it makes connection similarly hard for us and for the talented performers playing them.Designed by a solid team that includes Mimi Lien (sets), Matt Frey (lighting) and Bray Poor (sound), War works hard to conjure a physical sense of worlds overlapping into eternity, with sliding floors and projected words to translate for the nonverbal apes. But this production, which has become more congested since I saw it at the Yale Rep, still seems to exist in limbo in ways that its seriously gifted writer never intended."}
{"text": "It was quite a revelation when leaked documents, made public in April, showed that Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm, had helped 14,000 clients worldwide create offshore accounts to conceal assets or dodge taxes. On Monday, a report by The Times found that there were at least 2,400 clients based in the United States over the past decade.Some clients are sure to argue that the tactics used were legal forms of tax avoidance, not illegal tax evasion. And in some instances that is true. Many of the transactions examined by The Times were not illegal, including the use of offshore accounts to set up a business overseas. But many of the transactions are extremely suspicious and demand investigation and, if warranted, prosecution by federal authorities.At its most basic, the law requires American citizens to disclose their foreign holdings and pay any taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends earned on those holdings. Noncompliance with the law is rampant: Unpaid taxes on foreign accounts are estimated at $40 billion to $70 billion a year.Emails and other correspondence between Mossack Fonseca and some of its American clients discuss efforts to conceal assets and evade taxes. In one exchange, a citizen in Washington State asked the firm how to invest money in Panama without the United States government knowing anything about it. Instead of telling the potential client that that would be illegal, the firm wrote back that it had effective solutions for the problem, involving interlocking and anonymous offshore accounts, a private foundation and a shell corporation.Those tactics appear to have been aimed at evading taxes on investment income. The strategies became even more complex when the goal was to funnel money to children without paying gift or estate taxes that are usually prompted by large transfers.One of the multimillionaires described in the leaked papers and in The Times report, William Ponsoldt, used a foundation and eight shell companies  often with Mossack Fonseca employees as officers  in part to shift money to his two grown children. Without seeing Mr. Ponsoldts tax returns, it is impossible to know if he broke the law. (The Ponsoldts would not comment when contacted by The Times.) What is known is that complex offshore structures are commonly used by individuals to hide their assets and evade federal taxes.The government has the authority to audit the tax returns of the Americans who appear in the Panama Papers, but it would need help from the Republican-led Congress to do so. Congress has long deprived the Internal Revenue Service of adequate resources. Many of the audits would be routine, because the taxpayers in question would have nothing to hide. But audits that find fraud and evasion would be bombshells. At stake is more than revenue to run the government; also at stake is faith in the ability of government and its institutions to ensure a rule of law."}
{"text": "Arthur Brooks: Hi, Gail. I hope you had a nice break from talking politics with me. Did you finish writing your book? Or did you do what I usually do when a book is late  binge watch episodes of Get Smart?Gail Collins: Pretty close. I re-re-read Pride and Prejudice. Does Donald Trump remind you of Mr. Wickham? Of course he has money, but still theres something.Arthur: In my misspent youth I considered that stuff too cheerful and never read it, so I have to take your word for it. My tastes were much darker. While you were reading Austen in high school, I was carrying around a book of Dylan Thomas poetry. I can still recite some of the more famous parts by heart:Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Gail: Wow, do you realize were not going to have another whos-going-to-win-tomorrow discussion until November? What will we do with ourselves when we cant speculate about voter turnout on the basis of no information whatsoever? Things will get so tough were going to have to discuss issues, and when we do, I have dibs on infrastructure repair and recreational drones. You can have fracking and Syria.Arthur: Deal. When I roll out my thoughts on the progressive consumption tax there wont be a dry eye in the house.So where shall we start?Gail: Well, first let me go back to your poem. I should have asked this right away  the part about old age burning and raving  which one of the three remaining presidential candidates were you thinking about? The youngest of whom, I should point out, is Hillary Clinton.Arthur: Yes, astonishing isnt it? For years weve been hearing about needing a candidate who can relate to millennials, and then all the candidates wind up looking like the Recreation Committee from Sun City, Arizona.Unsurprisingly, it was the Sanders campaign that brought that particular verse back to mind. Between Clintons regular delegate lead and the fact that most of the superdelegates are handcuffed to a radiator in her basement, the contest is pretty much over. Yet Bernie rages on, risking deeper divisions within the party and lowering Clintons favorability numbers even further.Gail: You have to give the guy credit. Nobody thought he would go anywhere, and hes become a huge presence in the race. With that one great speech. Amazing experience to hear Bernie Sanders address a rally. Once. By the third time its like a very loud Groundhog Day.Arthur: Hes the political equivalent of the winner of Eurovision: just one catchy song that a third of the people like but that drives everyone else crazy. But a lot of people are humming it  Clinton may have the race wrapped up but hes still giving her a real headache in California.Gail: Clinton also made an absolutely terrific speech on national security Thursday. Maybe that will turn things around in California.Arthur: It was intended to remind people that she is experienced in this area. Also, she clearly hoped to use it to brand Donald Trump for the nine people left in America who havent formed an opinion about him. In her words, Donald Trumps ideas arent just different  they are dangerously incoherent. Theyre not really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.Gail: I loved that part.Arthur: It may get old having a presidential campaign that is little more than name-calling and personal insults, however.One thing that strikes me is how so many neoconservative national security experts  people like Bob Kagan and Max Boot  are publicly supporting her because of her defense and foreign policy stances. This must be an awkward development for all the progressive commentators who have staked their careers on bashing and belittling the hawks.Still, as my colleague Danielle Pletka points out, this speech is unlikely to sway any rank-and-file voters. Hard to imagine anyone out there saying, I used to support Trump, but Clinton really won me over on the NATO defense budgets issue. His approach to foreign policy is, We gotta stop losing all the time.Gail: Hers is, He could get us all blown up. Which I find sort of compelling.Arthur: Thats a classic argument, and a seemingly evergreen one that doesnt depend on the Republican in the race. When I was a kid, the Democrats said Reagan would get us all killed because he was such a hawk. Today, they say Trump might get us all killed even though hes something of a self-professed isolationist. For Democratic messaging, that argument is like the scarf that goes with everything.Gail: Accessorizing is all. I hear what youre saying about the neocons. I think a Republican who argued for a less aggressive, neo-isolationist foreign policy could get a lot of traction. But Trump is just all over the place. In a very unnerving way, when youre talking about a possible president.Arthur: It doesnt seem to have unnerved a majority of the Republican primary voters, though. In general, this campaign has uncovered some uncomfortable truths about public opinion. For example, free trade is just not very popular, and Americans are not that keen on alliances with foreigners. Really drives home the point that a big part of maintaining American leadership abroad is the strong moral leadership it takes here at home to make the case for engagement.Gail: Well, heres to strong moral leadership, preferably from someone who doesnt regard waterboarding as too moderate. But I dont think free trade was all that unpopular until about five minutes ago, historically speaking.Arthur: The Pew Research Center just did a really interesting study on this, actually. They found that this is a key difference between Trump supporters and non-Trump Republican voters. When asked if they agreed with the statement, Free trade has been a bad thing for the U.S., 67 percent of Trump voters agreed, compared with 43 percent of the non-Trump G.O.P. voters.Gail: Were going to have to talk about that soon  I know trade is one of your favorites. Thats why weve got all those weeks between the primaries and the conventions. We can go wild and crazy with TPP and fracking and carried interest reform.Arthur: We are completely out of control, Gail.Before we quit, you still havent given me your predictions on California and what it will mean for the Democrats. Clinton wins, Sanders drops out and endorses her? Sanders upsets Clinton and convinces the Navy SEALs to rescue the superdelegates from Hillarys basement? Tell me now!Gail: My guess is Clinton wins but either way, Sanders ought to drop out and endorse her. With the understanding that he was still going to take his folks to the convention to fight for a platform that reflects his values. I suspect only the fighting part of that scenario will happen. Arthur, why cant we all get along?"}
{"text": "Harambe, the 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla shot dead at the Cincinnati Zoo late last month after a 3-year-old boy fell into his enclosure, may be physically gone, his tissues harvested for research and his sperm extracted to help diversify the captive breeding gene pool.Yet the 440-pound silverback leaves another metaphorical gorilla in the room, raising questions that extend far beyond the particulars of the case, including whether the zoo or the boys mother were more to blame for Harambes death.For primatologists and conservationists who devote their lives to studying the great apes and to doing what they can to help protect the rapidly vanishing populations of the primates in the wild, a linked set of ethical and practical dilemmas looms almost unbearably large.As research continues to reveal the breadth of our genetic, emotional and cognitive kinship with the worlds four great apes  gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans  many primatologists admit to feeling frankly uncomfortable at the sight of a captive ape on display, no matter how luxe or natural the zoo exhibit may be.When I visit zoos, I have to turn off my feelings and just tell myself that I am at a museum admiring natures masterpieces, said the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, professor emerita at the University of California, Davis. Otherwise, I cant really justify keeping great apes in cages.At the same time, researchers acknowledge that apes in todays zoos, at least in the industrialized world, were all born and raised in captivity, and could no more survive being set free into the forests of Africa or Indonesia than could the average tourist on safari.Catherine Hobaiter of St. Andrews University in Scotland, who studies chimpanzees in Uganda, described the reaction of zoo gorillas that had been raised in indoor enclosures when the zoo finally added an outdoor annex to the exhibit.It was heartbreaking to see, she said. The gentlest specks of rain, and the gorillas were drumming on the door to get back inside. They were afraid of getting wet.Yet while primatologists concur that people have a moral obligation to care for the thousands of apes who are now in captivity and may live 60 years or longer, they differ on what that care should look like.Barbara Smuts, a renowned primatologist at the University of Michigan, recently distributed a petition asking that the other gorillas at the Cincinnati Zoo be relocated to a sanctuary far from the ogling, screeching crowds of their clothed relations.Researchers also disagree on whether we should continue breeding apes in captivity, and if so, to what end. Some experts believe that well-designed zoos play an essential educational role, and that exposure to a flesh-and-blood ape can be a transformative experience, especially for children.I remember going to the Milwaukee zoo when I was a kid and seeing the gorilla, said Peter D. Walsh, a biological anthropologist at Cambridge University who works on gorilla conservation in Africa. I was rapt. Its like a drug. You dont get that emotional bond from an IMAX movie.Others deride most zoos as little more than amusement parks with educational placards that few people bother to read.Theres no good evidence that captive apes are having any positive effect on their wild relatives, said Marc Bekoff, a behavioral ecologist and professor emeritus at the University of Colorado. As for education, he added, one of the most wonderful and educational lessons in biodiversity Ive ever seen was a snail exhibit at the Detroit Zoo.Peter Singer, a bioethicist at Princeton University, said, Our primary concern ought to be the well-being of gorillas, but zoos are constructed the other way around: The primary concern is that humans can see the gorillas.No matter their feelings about zoos, primatologists despair at the shocking statistics on wild apes.According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, all species and subspecies of wild apes rank as endangered or critically endangered, and in all cases, the trends point implacably downward. Apes are being lost to poaching, the bushmeat trade, habitat destruction and disease.In Sumatra and Borneo, forests have been pulped to make way for palm oil plantations, with devastating consequences for orangutans. Since the 1990s, 80 percent of Eastern lowland gorillas in Central Africa have died of Ebola.Even among Jane Goodalls celebrated chimpanzees of the Gombe forest in Tanzania, human activities have lately slashed the population by almost 40 percent.By the Red List reckoning, the planetwide total for all wild apes amounts to 350,000 individuals, down from premodern figures estimated in the millions.Nor does it help, said Dr. Walsh of Cambridge University, that the publics concern for the environment is now focused almost exclusively on climate change: I feel like shouting, Hey, guys, you could end climate change tomorrow and wed still be facing the greatest extinction crisis weve ever seen.Theres a reason humans and the great apes are bunched together taxonomically in the family Hominidae. We split off from chimpanzees and gorillas only about six million to 10 million years ago. The DNA of a chimpanzee is about 98 percent analogous to ours.Apes are avid tool users and tool makers. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish termites from a mound and to hunt monkeys hidden in tree holes. Orangutans can learn to row a boat and flip pancakes on a griddle.In observations at the Prague Zoo, Khalil Baalbaki watched gorillas turn empty crates into a series of household objects: tables, chairs, stepping stools to extend their reach, trays to carry their food and as weapons to be thrown in a fight. One young female gorilla extracted wood stuffing from a crate to fashion a pair of slippers, padding her feet with the fibers before venturing onto the snow.According to meta-analyses of intelligence studies, the average ape has the cognitive, quantitative and spatial skills of a 2- to 4-year-old human child. Yet Tetsuro Matsuzakawas laboratory in Japan showed that an exceptionally sharp-witted chimpanzee named Ayuma was twice as good as any university student at recalling numbers flashed on a screen.The great apes also exhibit basic temperamental differences. David Watts, a primatologist at Yale University who has studied chimpanzees and gorillas in the wild, found that while chimpanzees generally didnt like people or show much interest in their affairs, gorillas were deeply curious.I quickly realized that the gorillas not only wanted to touch me, but to climb all over me, he said. In one famous incident, a female gorilla stuck her hand down the shirt of a female primatologist and started feeling around.That innate curiosity, researchers suggest, may explain some of Harambes behavior seen on the video of his fatal encounter with the boy who fell into his enclosure  fiddling with the boys clothing, taking a quick peek as he pulled the boys pants upward. He tried pulling the boy into a grotto, perhaps to protect him or to claim the fascinating new playmate for himself.But with the mounting commotion and screams from the onlookers above, researchers said, Harambe grew agitated and soon assumed the stance of a male silverback in dominance display mode.Its what we used to call strutting, and male gorillas do it all the time, Dr. Watts said. A silverback will stand or walk around with arms and legs stiffly extended, his hair piloerect, to make himself look bigger and more impressive. Harambe was definitely doing that when he was standing over the boy.The behavior is mostly bluster: If Harambe had been intent on killing the boy, Dr. Hrdy said, as an interloping male gorilla might kill the babies sired by the silverback he just deposed  the quicker to claim the resident females for himself  he would have done it in seconds, probably with a bite to the skull.Nevertheless, the strut introduced risks of its own, particularly when Harambe began dragging the boy around the enclosure, as a displaying gorilla will sometimes drag around a large branch.Dr. Watts, who said he had been punched, knocked over and dragged by male gorillas but never seriously injured, wishes he had been at the Cincinnati Zoo as the crisis unfolded. He would have volunteered to enter the enclosure and assume a submissive fetal position on the floor to try drawing the gorillas attention from the boy. (He admits he is engaging in a kind of Monday morning strut-display of his own.)The look and logic of zoos have changed drastically over time. When the first apes were exhibited in the West, in the late 18th century, they were seen as trophies, evidence of imperial victory over savagery. The unfortunate souvenirs usually died within months of their arrival from disease or malnutrition.As zoos sought to improve the health of their resident apes, the enclosures often assumed a blandly sterile configuration, devoid of risky foliage or toys. That approach led to problems of its own, like boredom, repetitive behaviors and depression.More recently, most zoos have worked hard to give apes the mental and emotional stimulation they need, with tires for swinging, rocks for climbing, social groups for mutual grooming or bouts of contagious laughing or yawning.Frans de Waal of Emory University and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center said he was a big fan of quality zoos, although perhaps not for large, gregarious animals like killer whales and elephants. But for great apes, the record now is excellent, he said.Their health is good, they reproduce readily in captivity and they live 10 years or more longer than their wild peers. Indeed, the first gorilla born in captivity, a female named Colo, is still alive at the zoo in Columbus, Ohio, for which she was named. She will turn 60 in December, a birthday the great-great grandmother will not celebrate, zoo officials said, by wearing the adorable pinafore and straw bonnet her caretakers dressed her in as a youth.Dr. de Waal said that it was easier than ever to keep apes enriched and entertained.They like to work on computers, he said. When you bring in a touch screen, they get excited about that, and its a great way to teach the public about how smart they are.But what the public must accept, he said, is that the pleasant notion of zoos as nurseries for restocking wild populations of endangered animals has proved a fantasy in all but a handful of cases, most notably the successful reintroduction of zoo-bred golden lion tamarins into the Atlantic Forests of Brazil.By contrast, when the British aristocrat Damian Aspinall released 11 of his captive-bred lowland gorillas into the wilds of Gabon in 2014, five were soon violently dispatched, probably by a resident gorilla, while others disappeared.Yet critics say that zoo life has its serious downsides, too, as Harambes story made plain.The captive ape is the designated ambassador for its kind, an object lesson in evolutionary fraternity and shared fate for those of us who remain on the other side of the glass, proclaiming the primacy of human needs, desires and lives."}
{"text": "If youve come to rely on opioids for chronic pain, as a growing proportion of older adults has, you may have noticed that the drugs are becoming more difficult to get.Something had to be done, surely: More than 165,000 people died from overdoses from 1999 to 2014.But recent restrictions on access to these painkillers are likely to disproportionately affect the elderly  despite the fact that abuse and misuse of these painkillers have historically been lower among older patients than younger ones.Older patients are simply more apt to have chronic pain. Some of their doctors are going to get an earful when they suggest different medications or nonpharmacological alternatives, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended in new opioid guidelines in March.Dr. Mary Lynn McPherson, a palliative care specialist and a professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, told me about a 78-year-old patient with screaming pain from fibromyalgia (which doesnt respond to opioids anyway). Dr. McPherson urged her to undertake significant weight loss and begin regular aquatic therapy and stretching.Please, cant you just give me Percocet? she said. Her physician agreed to continue her prescription but, to the patients frustration, at a low dose.We do need to rein this in, Dr. McPherson said of opioid use. Yet like many health care professionals who work with older adults, shes worried about her patients suffering.How do you balance the need to relieve pain against the possibility that potent, habituating drugs can also sabotage peoples health, particularly when older people are more vulnerable than the young to opioids side effects? Its this enormous conundrum, she said.For patients who want to get or refill prescriptions, you have to jump through more hoops, Dr. McPherson said. At clinics and hospitals, at pharmacies, everyones level of suspicion is higher.Along with the C.D.C. guidelines, which urge more careful monitoring, doctors face a wave of state laws restricting access. The Drug Enforcement Administration also reclassified certain opioid formulations in 2014, making them less readily available.This represents a major swing of the medical pendulum. For years, doctors were warned against paying insufficient attention to pain. The Department of Veterans Affairs declared pain the fifth vital sign in 1999, and many hospitals and clinicians are evaluated in part on how well they treat it.For many older people, chronic pain  lasting longer than three months or longer than the bodys tissues normally need to heal  becomes an everyday burden. Older patients are more apt than younger ones to hurt from musculoskeletal disorders like arthritis, from nerves damaged by diabetes or shingles, from cancer, from multiple causes all at once. They have more surgery.Once, physicians actually struggled to induce older people to take opioids, which we used to call narcotics.Most older adults are phobic about these medications, said Dr. Cary Reid, a geriatrician and palliative care specialist who directs the Translational Research Institute on Pain in Later Life at Weill Cornell Medical College. You have to persuade them.Consider them persuaded.Last year, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, published a study using two large national surveys of outpatient visits to examine analgesic drug use among older adults (average age: 75).They found that from 1999 to 2010, the percentage of clinic visits involving any pain-relieving medication climbed to more than 19 percent from 13.6 percent. Opioid use drove much of that increase: The figure more than doubled, to 9 percent of visits from 4.1 percent.In February, a top Medicare administrator told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that in 2015, nearly 30 percent of those enrolled in Part D used an opioid prescription.But the Medicare population is more likely to suffer these drugs ill effects, too, leaving physicians to ponder troubling trade-offs.Older adults dont metabolize drugs as well as a 30- or 50-year old, so the medication stays in a persons system longer, Dr. Reid said.Opioids can bring on nausea and vomiting and often lead to constipation, which may then require additional medications, creating cycles of constipation and diarrhea. Long-term use can cause kidney and cardiac damage.Opioids affect balance and are associated with higher risks of falls and fractures. They can impair thinking and memory.Vexingly, the medications physicians might prescribe instead, including anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or naproxen, also pose greater dangers for older patients: bleeding, elevated blood pressure, reduced kidney function.Addiction and overdoses have historically been lower among older users, but public health experts have long wondered whether those patterns will change with the baby boomer cohort.The problem may grow worse with people who grew up in a culture where drugs were something to experiment with, Dr. Reid said.Experts worry, too, about diversion  relatives, neighbors or caregivers helping themselves to their elders medicines.Its complicated terrain, said Christine Ritchie, the lead author of the U.C.S.F. study and a past president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Nationally, opioid prescriptions have begun to decline, and some physicians have stopped prescribing them altogether.As an older patient seeking pain relief, youll probably find that while you may continue using opioids, youll get more questions, hear more about alternatives  and take home fewer pills.For example, doctors can no longer call in prescriptions with refills for certain formulations, notably Vicodin. Under the Drug Enforcement Administrations tighter controls on such hydrocodone combinations, you have to take a paper prescription to a pharmacy, then return to your doctor for a new prescription every month, to allow closer monitoring. Those can be onerous requirements for older people in pain.Youll also find doctors talking about reasonable expectations. You probably cant make the pain a zero, Dr. McPherson said. Were trying to make it tolerable.Theyll recommend a raft of nondrug therapies to manage pain, too: exercise, weight loss, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation, tai chi or yoga. Research has demonstrated that several of these approaches can reduce pain.But not enough practitioners offer alternatives like cognitive behavioral therapy, and insurers (including Medicare) generally wont pay for them. If the C.D.C. wants doctors to advocate a multimodal approach to chronic pain (and it does), giving preference to nonpharmacological therapies, we need a system that can deliver it and can pay for it, Dr. Reid said.In the interim, patients can seek out tai chi, yoga and mindfulness training at senior centers and Y.M.C.A.s. Early studies have also shown that therapy sessions via the internet or videoconferencing can reduce pain.Maybe future pain patients will look like Irene Cohen, 69, a homemaker in White Plains. She has had debilitating back and leg pain since she fell down a flight of subway steps when she was 20. In the decades since, with a desperation familiar to many, she has tried nearly every remedy, including two back operations.At her lowest, Mrs. Cohen couldnt walk more than a block or two without unfolding her cane into a tripod seat that let her rest. She cooked dinner while seated on a stool. She couldnt lift her newborn grandsons.Pain just became part of me, she said.Over time, though, she has developed a combination of therapies that allow her to function. Acupuncture, chiropractic and hypnosis proved ineffective, but she finds a weekly massage essential.She exercises faithfully, taking a SilverSneakers class five days a week and doing chair yoga, and has worked up to a 15-minute walk on a slow treadmill, which is a miracle.And when her pain flares anyway, she has a prescription for Vicodin, which she uses so sparingly that a bottle of 120 tablets lasts most of a year.Shes what we hope people will do, said Dr. Reid, her physician. She uses the drugs in a very smart way. Shes got a whole portfolio of things she can use. And despite the impairments pain has brought, shes living a life."}
{"text": "JUN, Spain  When Jos Antonio Rodrguez Salass daughter, Martina, was born in April, he  like many proud new parents  turned to social media to share the news.But Mr. Rodrguez Salas, the mayor of Jun, a small town nestled in the foothills outside Granada in southern Spain, did not post a message through his own Twitter account. Instead, he wrote a short message from @martinajun, a Twitter account he had created for his newborn, saying, Ive just been born.To Mr. Rodrguez Salass more than 400,000 followers on the social network, his actions came as no surprise. That is because the Spanish politician has spent much of the last five years turning Jun (pronounced hoon), whose population barely tops 3,500, into one of the most active users of Twitter anywhere in the world.For the towns residents, more than half of whom have Twitter accounts, their main way to communicate with local government officials is now the social network. Need to see the local doctor? Send a quick Twitter message to book an appointment. See something suspicious? Let Juns policeman know with a tweet.People in Jun can still use traditional methods, like completing forms at the town hall, to obtain public services. But Mr. Rodrguez Salas said that by running most of Juns communications through Twitter, he not only has shaved on average 13 percent, or around $380,000, from the local budget each year since 2011, but he also has created a digital democracy where residents interact online almost daily with town officials.Everyone can speak to everyone else, whenever they want, said Mr. Rodrguez Salas in his office surrounded by Twitter paraphernalia, while sporting a wristband emblazoned with #LoveTwitter. We are on Twitter because thats where the people are.While politicians like President Obama and Narendra Modi, Indias prime minister, regularly send messages on Twitter to their millions of followers, Juns use of the social network is something different.By incorporating Twitter into every aspect of daily life  even the local schools lunch menu is sent out through social media  this Spanish town has become a test bed for how cities may eventually use social networks to offer public services.Jun is one of a group of islands of innovation in the public sector, said Arthur Mickoleit, a researcher who until recently was a digital government adviser at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Theyre tapping into social media to improve public services.Juns embrace of Twitter did not happen overnight.Mr. Rodrguez Salas, a career politician, was elected Juns mayor in 2005  the year before Twitter was founded  after serving as deputy mayor. In 2011, he asked all town officials  from his deputy to the street sweeper  to open accounts on Twitter and send messages about their daily activities. The goal, he said, was to create greater accountability and transparency over how Jun was run. Mr. Rodrguez Salas added that he chose Twitter over Facebook because Twitter allowed quicker interactions.Juns officials also started asking residents to verify their Twitter accounts at the town hall  a relatively simple process of checking peoples government IDs with their online profiles to ensure their concerns were answered online.Officials began with basic services like public maintenance, letting people tweet when they saw a broken streetlight or a road that needed cleaning.Mr. Rodrguez Salas said such activities built good will with residents, who at first opened Twitter accounts sporadically. But since 2013, the online activity has become almost universal as people saw how their neighbors used the service.Mara Jos Martnez, Juns information technology chief, also ran courses at the community center to teach Twitter 101, such as sending direct messages and using the right hashtag during local campaigns.One recent hashtag that residents have used is #EndesaMeEstresa, or Endesa Youre Stressing Me Out, to highlight problems with Endesa, a local utility. After the company was confronted with Juns angry tweets, it quickly fixed the blackouts, Mr. Rodrguez Salas said. An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment.We can check if theyre really working or not, said Paco Castellano, a resident who recently opened a Twitter account, mostly to keep tabs on local officials.Mr. Rodrguez said these interactions have made the town more efficient just as Juns budget  like many Spanish towns  is under strain. His officials rarely receive calls or visits from people looking for help, he said.Using Twitter has also reduced the need for some jobs. Jun cut its police force by three-quarters, to just one officer, soon after turning to Twitter as its main form of communication when residents began tweeting potential problems directly to the mayor.We dont have one police officer, Mr. Rodrguez Salas said. We have 3,500.Jun has not gone unnoticed by Twitter. Dick Costolo, the companys chief executive until 2015, visited last summer, leaving his handprints in cement below an obelisk topped with Twitters logo of a blue bird. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with funding from Twitter, has analyzed how the towns residents have benefited from using the social network. Jun does not receive money from Twitter for using the service.For Justo Ontiveros, Juns remaining police officer, those benefits are up close and personal. He now receives up to 20, mostly private, messages from locals daily with concerns ranging from advice on filling out forms to reporting crimes like domestic abuse and speeding.Mr. Ontiveros said his daily Twitter interactions have given him both greater visibility within the community and a higher level of personal satisfaction, as neighbors now regularly stop him in the street to discuss things that he has posted on Twitter.It gives people more power to come and talk to me about their problems, said Mr. Ontiveros, whose department Twitter account has more than 3,500 followers.Still, Juns reliance on Twitter has not been universally embraced.Several residents said they would prefer officials to focus on providing public services over promoting themselves on the social network. The mayors wife also has kept a low profile on the social network. She prefers to be anonymous, Mr. Rodrguez Salas said.Its unclear, too, whether lessons from Jun can be replicated on a larger scale, several analysts said, while some question whether a publicly listed company like Twitter should be permitted to help provide government services.Should a municipality take pride in cutting its work force by outsourcing it to an international company? said Richard Rogers, a professor of new media at the University of Amsterdam.For Jos Mara de la Torre Sarmiento, an architect who recently stopped by Juns town hall after work to verify his Twitter account, the chance to quickly send tweets remained preferable to submitting government forms that often took weeks to process.I work from home and use internet services all the time, he said during the five-minute verification process. Why cant I do the same thing when I use public services?"}
{"text": "Kurt Busch felt like a game show contestant who had to beat the clock to win a prize.Told that his Chevrolet was two laps shy of having enough fuel for the finishing push on Monday, Busch did all he could to save, scrimp and stretch over the final five laps to give himself a shot at the win. He coasted, he kept his foot off the gas, and he even turned his engine off when he headed into the turns at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.I kept finding ways to think I was saving fuel, he said. The way the fuel mileage played out, I didnt know if wed have enough.With an interim crew chief calling the shots, Busch found enough ways to make his gas last and won the Sprint Cup race, his first victory of the season and a welcome dose of good news for Stewart-Haas Racing.Busch, the 2004 series champion, was urged by his team to step on it hard for the final lap and somehow made it work on a track with the longest front stretch in motorsports. There was no pain at the pump: Busch not only had enough fuel left to win but also had enough for victory burnouts and a celebratory lap around the track.Dale Earnhardt Jr. was second, and Brad Keselowski, Chase Elliott and Joey Logano rounded out the top five in a race postponed one day because of rain.Busch won with the interim crew chief Johnny Klausmeier, the lead engineer, calling the shots as Tony Gibson served a one-race suspension.Detroits Michael Fulmer, a rookie right-hander, allowed two hits over six innings in another outstanding performance, and Justin Upton and James McCann homered to lift the Tigers to an 11-0 victory over the visiting Toronto Blue Jays.Fulmer (6-1) struck out five and walked three in his third straight start without allowing a run. He has won four straight starts, allowing only one run during that span.Torontos J. A. Happ (6-3) allowed six runs and six hits in five innings.Around the Majors Jon Lester pitched eight scoreless innings, Jason Heyward hit a two-run homer and the Chicago Cubs held off the Phillies, 6-4, in Philadelphia. Lester (7-3) struck out nine, walked none and allowed four hits.  Mark Trumbo and Matt Wieters hit solo home runs in the seventh inning to back a sparkling pitching performance by Mike Wright, and the Baltimore Orioles beat visiting Kansas City, 4-1, extending the Royals losing streak to five games.President Obama honored the Denver Broncos at the White House for winning Super Bowl 50 with one of the best defenses in history and one of the best quarterbacks, Peyton Manning.The Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers, 24-10, to earn the invitation. Obama mentioned that the teams victories over the course of the season were not always pretty. The Broncos, he noted, won a record 11 games by a touchdown or less.You dont do that without one of the greatest defenses of all time, Obama said.Obama reminded the audience in the Rose Garden that he was a huge Bears fan and felt obliged to mention that franchises defense from the 1985 season, which ended with a Super Bowl victory for Chicago.Nobody remembers, he said. But Ive got to admit this one was pretty good, too.Obama singled out linebackers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware for particular praise.In describing Denvers offense, Obama said it always seemed to come up big when it needed to.Manning, who retired after an 18-year career, stood directly behind Obama at the ceremony.We were all obviously a little bit disappointed to see him hang it up this spring, but as somebody who is just a little bit older than he is, I was sympathetic to the idea that running around with these guys, you know, it takes its toll, Obama said of Manning. But it is great to see somebody with a career like that, who always conducted himself on the field and off the field the way he did, be able to go out on top.TALIB ON THE MEND Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib was released from a Dallas hospital and was expected to rejoin the team at a three-day minicamp set to begin Tuesday. Talib was shot in his lower right leg at a Dallas nightclub over the weekend but did not require surgery. The Dallas police are investigating the shooting.AROUND THE N.F.L. The Buffalo Bills signed their top draft pick, defensive end Shaq Lawson. The terms of the contract were not provided. Lawson was drafted 19th over all out of Clemson and was one of college footballs top pass rushers last year. He was a consensus all-American and led the nation with 25 tackles for a loss and had 12 sacks. Lawson is not expected to be ready for the start of the season after having surgery last month to repair a shoulder injury.  Commissioner Roger Goodell took the air out of the notion that the N.F.L. would reach a settlement with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after Bradys latest appeal of a four-game Deflategate suspension. At this stage, no, Goodell said, adding that there had been several previous bids to reach a settlement. The courts will make their decisions, and well move forward on that basis. The comments were Goodells first in two weeks since Bradys lawyers asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for a new hearing before an expanded panel of judges.Spains Olympic Committee said 3,000 bottles of insect repellent would be available to its athletes to help them avoid the Zika virus at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this summer.At a meeting to inform the local sports federations about the virus, the committee said it had recently reached a deal with the laboratory Omega Pharma to provide its strongest repellent to the hundreds of Spanish athletes going to Rio in August.Committee doctors said there was a need to remain engaged but not worried about Zika, noting that only one in four people who have the disease develop its symptoms.They stressed, however, that pregnant women in the delegation should not go to Rio."}
{"text": "MADRID  Catalans may still be weighing whether to quit Spain, but Catalan cities with Jewish histories have already made up their minds. Quietly, last month, they decided to withdraw from a Spanish network of cities with historic Jewish medieval quarters.The planned exit of five Catalan cities, which account for one-fifth of the network of Jewish quarters, will also force the network to appoint a new leadership, as both its president and secretary general were Catalans.Marta Madrenas, the mayor of Girona, one of the Catalan cities that has decided to leave, said in an interview that she and her colleagues would instead create their own Catalan network soon because we think we can do better in terms of showcasing our Jewish patrimony.We want to do it in a more serious manner, with more cultural and scientific rigor, she said.Girona, she noted, has already set up a center of Jewish studies. A new Catalan network, she said, can put an emphasis on introducing more conferences, debates, as well as developing student scholarships  it must be about culture and cant be all about tourism and tour operators.The Spanish network said it was disappointed and surprised by the withdrawal, which was announced by some of the Catalan cities at an internal meeting of network officials in May. No date has been set for the creation of a new Catalan network.The split comes amid a major secessionist tussle between Madrid and Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia. Catalan separatist parties, which have a majority of seats in the regions Parliament, are pushing to divide Catalonia from the rest of Spain and have established a road map to create the structures of a new Catalan state within 18 months, despite fierce opposition from the acting government in Madrid of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.We believe we have a project that unifies cities and we dont understand and share the reasons for leaving, said Marta Puig Quixal, managing director of the network of Jewish quarters. Ms. Puig Quixal argued that this breakup is another example of how Catalan institutions are looking to go their own way.Mayor Madrenas said, This isnt about promoting or recovering our Catalan identity, because we already have it, but about whether investing in this network gives us the kind of return that we would expect. She noted that Seville, the capital of the southern region of Andalusia, had also left the network, in January.The network was created in 1995 to safeguard Spains heritage and promote cultural, academic and tourism projects relating to its Sephardic past, as well as set up exchange projects to increase knowledge and mutual respect for peoples, cultures and traditions, according to the networks website.Beside Girona, the other Catalan cities in the Spanish network are Besal, Castell dEmpries, Tortosa and Barcelona.In 1492, the Catholic monarchs signed an edict to expel the Jews, forcing a mass exodus. Some Jews chose instead to convert to Catholicism and remain in Spain. During the Spanish Inquisition, Jewish culture and buildings were then hidden or wiped out.In recent years, archaeologists have found more evidence of Spains once-thriving Jewish community, largely as a result of discoveries made during urban construction projects. Last year, the Spanish Parliament approved a long-awaited law to give Spanish citizenship to thousands of Sephardic Jews whose ancestors were expelled in 1492."}

We hear the money the U.S. players are making, the Brazil players are making.They tell themselves that they would like to make that money, too.But we do it for the love and for the country, for the game we love, Millien added after a training session in Bradenton, Fla., that preceded Haitis trip to Seattle last weekend. God blesses us by letting us play this game, and we give the country something back.At times, money is the least of Haitis problems. The teams coach in 2003, Fernando Clavijo, was able to spend only about a week scouting players on subpar fields in the tiny country after he was named to take charge of Haitis World Cup qualifying campaign that year. But after he heard gunshots outside a stadium one day, he decided his players should train in Florida  or basically anywhere other than at home.Several years later, a few domestic-based national team players were in Haiti during the devastating 2010 earthquake. One, midfielder James Marcelin, could not be located in Port-au-Prince for weeks until he was eventually discovered and brought to America by friends. These days Marcelin plays for the Carolina RailHawks, another N.A.S.L. team, but the conditions of his work visa mean he cannot leave the United States  even for league games in Canada, or to return to Haiti  because if he does, he fears he will not be allowed to re-enter.Its a miracle for us to be a part of this, and a miracle weve survived, Marcelin said. The hope is there. We just have to push ourselves. Not by saying it; by working hard for it. We know the feeling is that theres a lot of countries better than us. We just have to put in the work.It was a fluke goal by Millien in a playoff against Trinidad and Tobago in January  a hopeful cross that somehow eluded a teammate, a defender and the goalkeeper  that allowed Haiti to qualify for the Copa Amrica. The tournament is most high-profile soccer stage Haiti has appeared on since it participated, just as improbably, in the 1974 World Cup.I was like, Wow, did it really go in? Millien said of his playoff goal. I have no way to describe how I felt. Now we play the senior Brazil side for the first time ever, in one of the biggest tournaments in the world. We talk about this every day.This is serious business, and the Haitians have a deadly serious coach in the Frenchman Patrice Neveu, who previously headed the Niger and Congo national sides. Neveu, who assumed the reins shortly before Haitis playoff match against Trinidad and Tobago, rides the players hard. A few acknowledged that they were not necessarily accustomed to such demanding treatment; several called him aggressive, and said his temperament required an adjustment.In every way, the Haitians remain the ultimate underdog on Wednesday. Haiti is ranked No. 74 in the world by FIFA; Brazil, a five-time World Cup champion, is No. 7. Haiti has about 10.3 million people; Brazils population is 200 million. And while Brazil has its own problems of style and expectations, it is considered a favorite to win the Copa, even without the star forward Neymar.The contrast in resources and support for each team is the most obvious difference between them, but there is also the matter of compensation, or, in Haitis case, the lack thereof. While many of the Brazilians make their living playing for rich European clubs, the mostly minor league Haitians began their preparation for the Copa Amrica by receiving $200 to $300 each as a per diem and were still trying to negotiate a slight raise.Haitis team is a mixed bag of professionals. Four players performed recently in the top French league, while others have played in places like India and Vietnam. Midfielder Soni Mustivar is a member of Sporting Kansas City in Major League Soccer, and five Haitian players are under contract with N.A.S.L. clubs.To ensure that Haitians eager to support their team enjoyed both access and a sense of community around the Copa matches, the United States national team forward Jozy Altidore, the son of Haitian immigrants, recently arranged for public broadcasts of the countrys games, and others, through a foundation bearing his name. Big screens were imported from Miami and set up near schools in a program created in conjunction with the St. Luke Foundation for Haiti.Usually, youd have hundreds of people crowded around a small screen, watching on television, said Wynn Walent, the assistant national director for the St. Luke Foundation. Our students who walk several hours a day to school will get a chance to watch this in a beautiful place on a big screen.Altidore is missing the Copa Amrica because of a hamstring injury, but he said that he can appreciate just how different, and how difficult, it is for the Haitian players to succeed.People dont realize when they sit and watch, they dont understand what goes into this beforehand  the hotels, the nutrition, the physios, he said of competing internationally. All these things play a part and havent been available for Haiti. When you consider the obstacles in their way and look at how the product on the field has improved, you wonder how good they could be.On Wednesday, the Haitians will get a quick reading on their soccer evolution, measured by the opponents in yellow, green and blue uniforms:Brazil, the gold standard."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Twenty-seven years ago, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web as a way for scientists to easily find information. It has since become the worlds most powerful medium for knowledge, communications and commerce  but that doesnt mean Mr. Berners-Lee is happy with all of the consequences.It controls what people see, creates mechanisms for how people interact, he said of the modern day web. Its been great, but spying, blocking sites, repurposing peoples content, taking you to the wrong websites  that completely undermines the spirit of helping people create.So on Tuesday, Mr. Berners-Lee gathered in San Francisco with other top computer scientists  including Brewster Kahle, head of the nonprofit Internet Archive and an internet activist  to discuss a new phase for the web.Today, the World Wide Web has become a system that is often subject to control by governments and corporations. Countries like China can block certain web pages from their citizens, and cloud services like Amazon Web Services hold powerful sway. So what might happen, the computer scientists posited, if they could harness newer technologies  like the software used for digital currencies, or the technology of peer-to-peer music sharing  to create a more decentralized web with more privacy, less government and corporate control, and a level of permanence and reliability?National histories, the story of a country, now happen on the web, said Vinton G. Cerf, another founder of the internet and chief internet evangelist at Google, in a phone interview ahead of a speech to the group scheduled for Wednesday. People think making things digital means theyll last forever, but that isnt true now.The project is in its early days, but the discussions  and caliber of the people involved  underscored how the World Wide Webs direction in recent years has stirred a deep anxiety among some technologists. The revelations by Edward J. Snowden that the web has been used by governments for spying and the realization that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google have become gatekeepers to our digital lives have added to concerns.On Tuesday, Mr. Berners-Lee and Mr. Kahle and others brainstormed at the event, called the Decentralized Web Summit, over new ways that web pages could be distributed broadly without the standard control of a web server computer, as well as ways of storing scientific data without having to pay storage fees to companies like Amazon, Dropbox or Google.Efforts at creating greater amounts of privacy and accountability, by adding more encryption to various parts of the web and archiving all versions of a web page, also came up. Such efforts would make it harder to censor content.Edward Snowden showed weve inadvertently built the worlds largest surveillance network with the web, said Mr. Kahle, whose group organized the conference. China can make it impossible for people there to read things, and just a few big service providers are the de facto organizers of your experience. We have the ability to change all that.Many people conflate the internets online services and the web as one and the same  yet they are technically quite different. The internet is a networking infrastructure, where any two machines can communicate over a variety of paths, and one local network of computers can connect with other networks.The web, on the other hand, is a popular means to access that network of networks. But because of the way web pages are created, managed and named, the web is not fully decentralized. Take down a certain server and a certain web page becomes unavailable. Links to pages can corrode over time. Censorship systems like Chinas Great Firewall eliminate access to much information for most of its people. By looking at internet addresses, it is possible for governments and companies to get a good idea of who is reading which web pages.In some ways, the efforts to change the technology of creating the web are a kind of coming-of-age story. Mr. Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, as a tool for scientists. Today, the web still runs on technologies of the older world.Consider payments. In many cases, people pay for things online by entering credit card information, not much different from handing a card to a merchant for an imprint.At the session on Tuesday, computer scientists talked about how new payment technologies could increase individual control over money. For example, if people adapted the so-called ledger system by which digital currencies are used, a musician might potentially be able to sell records without intermediaries like Apples iTunes. News sites might be able to have a system of micropayments for reading a single article, instead of counting on web ads for money.Ad revenue is the only model for too many people on the web now, Mr. Berners-Lee said. People assume todays consumer has to make a deal with a marketing machine to get stuff for free, even if theyre horrified by what happens with their data. Imagine a world where paying for things was easy on both sides.Mr. Kahles Internet Archive, which exists on a combination of grants and fees from digitizing books for libraries, operates the Wayback Machine, which serves as a record of discontinued websites or early versions of pages.To make that work now, Mr. Kahle has to search and capture a page, then give it a brand new web address. With the right kind of distributed system, he said, the archive can have all of the versions, because there would be a permanent record located across many sites.The movement to change how the web is built, like a surprising number of technology discussions, has an almost religious dimension.Some of the participants are extreme privacy advocates who have created methods of building sites that cant be censored, using cryptography. Mr. Cerf said he was wary of extreme anonymity, but thought the ways that digital currencies permanently record transactions could be used to make the web more accountable.Still, not all the major players agree on whether the web needs decentralizing.The web is already decentralized, Mr. Berners-Lee said. The problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one Twitter for microblogging. We dont have a technology problem, we have a social problem.One that can, perhaps, be solved by more technology."}
{"text": "The Playboy Mansion, the quintessential party house that held a special place in the imagination of American men for decades, has found a buyer, a Playboy spokesman said on Tuesday.The spokesman, John Vlautin, said the Los Angeles mansion, home to Hugh Hefner, 90, the founder of Playboy Magazine, was under contract to be sold to Daren Metropoulos, 32, a principal at the private equity firm Metropoulos & Company and an owner of Hostess Brands, the maker of that indestructible, cream-filled snack cake, the Twinkie.Mr. Vlautin declined to comment on the financial details, citing confidentiality restrictions.The house, which is nearly 20,000 square feet, according to its sales listing, was built in 1927 in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles and has 29 rooms, including 12 bedrooms. It has a wine cellar, a theater, a gym, tennis courts and a huge swimming pool, complete with a shadowy grotto.Its listing price: $200 million.The listing also said the mansion was one of a select few private residences in L.A. with a zoo license.Mr. Metropoulos will not have to go far once the purchase is completed: He lives next door in a house he acquired in 2009.He would, however, have to be willing to live with a nonagenarian celebrity roommate if he wanted to move in right away. Mr. Vlautin said that, regardless of the sale, Mr. Hefner planned to stay in the house indefinitely. Playboy bought the house in 1971, and Mr. Hefner moved in (permanently) in 1975.A spokeswoman for Mr. Metropouloss company said in a statement that after Mr. Hefners tenancy ends, the buyer hoped to connect his current house with the Playboy Mansion, ultimately returning the combined 7.3-acre compound to the original vision executed by noted architect Arthur R. Kelly.The mansion is famous for the lavish parties hosted by Mr. Hefner and attended by the rich, the famous and the bunny-eared. The house has been featured as the ideal party destination for men in movies like Beverly Hills Cop II and television shows like Entourage on HBO.Holly Madison, a former girlfriend and housemate of Mr. Hefners and one of the stars of the E! reality show The Girls Next Door, which frequently featured the mansion, offered a different perspective on the house in her 2015 memoir. She called the climate toxic and described a stifling atmosphere that caused her to develop a stutter and even to consider suicide.Mr. Metropoulos told The Wall Street Journal, which reported the deal, that he was more interested in the mansions historic architecture than its reputation as a party pad.The heritage of this property transcends its celebrity, and to have the opportunity to serve as its steward would be a true privilege, he said.The Playboy Mansion was listed for sale early this year, and potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring Playboy Enterprises in its entirety. The company has suffered since the advent of internet pornography, and in March, its magazine stopped featuring fully nude women."}
{"text": "They replaced horses, didnt they? Thats how the late, great economist Wassily Leontief responded 35 years ago to those who argued technology would never really replace peoples work.Horses hung around in the labor force for quite some time after they were first challenged by modern communications technologies like the telegraph and the railroad, hauling stuff and people around farms and cities. But when the internal combustion engine came along, horses  as a critical component of the world economy  were history.Cutting horses oat rations might have delayed their replacement by tractors, but it wouldnt have stopped it. All that was left to do, for those who cared for 20 million newly unemployed horses, was to put them out to pasture.Had horses had an opportunity to vote and join the Republican or Democratic Party, Leontief wrote, they might have been able to get the necessary appropriation from Congress.Most economists still reject Professor Leontiefs analogy, but the conventional economic consensus is starting to fray. The productivity figures may not reflect it yet but new technology does seem more fundamentally disruptive than technologies of the past. Robots are learning on their own. Self-driving cars seem just a few regulations away from our city streets.As the idea sinks in that humans as workhorses might also be on the way out, what happens if the job market stops doing the job of providing a living wage for hundreds of millions of people? How will the economy spread money around, so people can afford to pay the rent?What if, say, the bottom quarter of the population in the United States and Europe simply couldnt find a job at a wage that could cover the cost of basic staples? What if smart-learning machines took out lawyers and bankers? Or even, God forbid, journalists and economists?If you read my column last week you know the dim view I take of the Universal Basic Income  a minimum level of money offered to every citizen  as a tool to combat poverty in a country like the United States where there is still plenty of work for most people to do. Paying for it would require either shredding the safety net as we know it or raising taxes to Scandinavian levels.On Sunday, an overwhelming majority of Swiss voters apparently agreed, voting down a proposal to give every adult roughly $2,560 a month, regardless of their work status, and $640 for each child under 18.But that doesnt end the case for a universal income, as many of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley will tell anyone who asks. If we are facing a not-so-distant future of robot-fueled growth and rising potential for mass disemployment, maybe its time to start thinking about how to provide a lot more income that isnt directly tied to a job.Jeffrey D. Sachs of Columbia University has been working with a series of colleagues on an economic model of a world in which robotization both raises economic output and immiserates workers, pushing them out of their jobs. It is not a theoretical impossibility.The point for me is that these two scenarios  robots lead to nirvana and hell  can happen side by side, Professor Sachs told me. Generally capital wins and all labor can lose. It shows up as a fall in the labor share of national income.In that event, preventing a dynastic society of relentlessly growing inequality would require large-scale redistribution. It could even take the form of a universal income paid for with a hefty estate tax  using some of the vast profits accruing to the owners of robots to finance a living for everybody else.Since most paid human labor would be pointless, the disincentive to work produced by a monthly check would be unimportant. People could devote themselves to unpaid creative affairs.Dont destroy the robots, Professor Sachs said. But recognize that not everybody would be better off as a result of market forces. With redistribution everybody could be made better off.Many experts are not convinced. For every analysis like this one  forecasting that half of all jobs in the United States will be replaced by new technology  others point out that there is no evidence of humanitys impending redundancy.A research paper published last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development argued that even the occupations most at risk of being replaced by machines contained lots of tasks that were hard to automate, like face-to-face interaction with customers.It concluded that only 9 percent of American workers faced a high risk of being replaced by an automaton. Austrians, Germans and Spaniards were the most vulnerable, but only 12 percent of them risked losing their jobs to information technology.Ever since the Luddites started smashing textile machines in the 19th century, workers have, as a whole, done rather well adapting to new technologies, retooling to find new jobs in other industries. Employment has increased throughout the modern age. As Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard put it a few years ago: It seems unlikely that millions of workers are headed to the glue factory like discarded horses.And yet the nature of the new research, patiently counting how many jobs are likely to stay or go, suggests how far economists have come from the days when they simply dismissed popular fears of technological unemployment as ludicrous.Last November, Lawrence H. Summers  a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, a top economic adviser in President Obamas first term and one of the youngest people to earn tenure on the Harvard faculty  strode up to the podium at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and made an unlikely admission: Perhaps economists were not always the smartest people in the room.He reminisced about his undergraduate days at M.I.T. in the 1970s, when the debate over the idea of technological unemployment pitted smart people, exemplified by the great economist Robert Solow, and stupid people, exemplified by a bunch of sociologists.It was stupid to think technological progress would reduce employment. If technology increased productivity  allowing companies and their workers to make more stuff in less time  people would have more money to spend on more things that would have to be made, creating jobs for other people.But at some point Mr. Summers experienced an epiphany. It sort of occurred to me, he said. Suppose the stupid people were right. What would it look like? And what it looked like fits pretty well with what the world looks like today.For large categories of workers, wages are inadequate. Many are withdrawing from the labor force altogether. In the 1960s, one in 20 men between 25 and 54 were not working. Today its three in 20. The population is generally healthier than it was in the 1960s; work is almost uniformly less demanding. Still, more workers are on disability.Maybe the stupid people werent quite as stupid as I thought they were, Mr. Summers conceded. This was at least a serious concern that had to be thought about.In a world in which many Americans do not work during large chunks of their lives, we might have to conceive of Social Security and disability much more broadly than we do today.That, Mr. Summers said, could start to look like a universal income."}
{"text": "Dr. Dennis McCullough, a pioneer of the slow medicine movement, which advocates palliative care over invasive regimens for older patients suffering from the inevitable and irreversible decline of aging, died on Friday in Bar Harbor, Me. He was 72.The cause was a heart attack, his wife, the poet Pamela Harrison, said.Dr. McCullough, who lived in Norwich, Vt., had gone to Maine to address community nurses in a conference about slow medicine, a protocol that, dying suddenly and relatively young, he never had the opportunity to apply to himself.Slow medicine, which is akin to palliative and hospice care, has been increasingly available in nursing homes.Dr. McCulloughs involvement in the movement was inspired by a medical ordeal he endured, and then reinforced six years later by his mothers lingering debility before her death.In 2001, a hereditary autoimmune disease sidelined him from his geriatric-medicine practice at a retirement community in Hanover, N.H. He used crutches for nearly three years.The illness transformed him from a capable and experienced caregiver to a weak and vulnerable care receiver, he wrote in My Mother, Your Mother: Embracing Slow Medicine, the Compassionate Approach to Caring for Your Aging Loved Ones, published in 2008. And it led to an epiphany.My suddenly changed situation brought me new emotional insights into disability and dependency, he wrote.Dr. McCullough has been widely credited with coining the term slow medicine, borrowing the concept from the slow food movement in Italy, which promotes local production methods as an antidote to fast food. He became a crusader for the cause, arguing for a pragmatic form of elder care that combines cooperation, coordination and conservation of limited resources in the patients best interest rather than inflicting death by intensive care.The vast machinery of modern medicine, which can be heroically invoked to save a premature baby, when visited upon an equally vulnerable and failing great-grandmother, may not save her life so much as torturously and inhumanely complicate her dying, he wrote in 2008 in the alumni magazine of the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College.In My Mother, Your Mother, he wrote: Slow medicine is not a plan for getting ready to die. It is a plan for understanding, for caring, and for living well in the time that is left.Dr. McCullough invoked his mothers entreaty  Why is dying so hard to do?  in recalling her care during the five weeks in a hospice after being transferred there from a nursing home, where she had lived for 18 months.All medication except minor pain relief was halted. She slept 20 hours a day. But the predictability of care and the regular presence of her caregivers, he wrote, enabled her to regain her dignity and forge closer relationships with her family in the time she had left.Our gratitude for the loving care she so selflessly gave to us, he wrote, has been enriched and deepened by our memories of the grace and patience with which she taught us how to die a good death.Dennis Michael McCullough was born on Jan. 19, 1944, in Hancock, Mich., on the Upper Peninsula, and raised in Dollar Bay. His father, James, left the family when Dennis was about 5. Dr. McCullough recalled being raised by a single mother, the former Bertha Juntenen, on welfare in a poor Scandinavian-American mining town.His hockey prowess earned him a scholarship to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. He attended Harvard, where he was captain of the hockey team, and graduated in 1967. He received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School.He married Ms. Harrison before graduating from medical school. Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Kate McCullough; two grandsons; and a sister, Maureen Dolan.Dr. McCullough practiced over the years in Canada, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, the Caribbean and Vermont. From 1994 to 2002 he was the chief clinical officer in the Department of Community and Family Medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H., and he was recruited as the first medical director for Kendal at Hanover, a retirement community, where he honed his slow medicine procedure.So often today, despite intending to do the best work we can, we face a medical care system that seems to work at odds with our parents stated desires and wishes  to die at home, to let go when the time comes, to avoid the suffering I have seen my friends go through, Dr. McCullough wrote in My Mother, Your Mother.It turns out, he continued, that spending a lot of money in high-tech medical care institutions in Miami or New York City doesnt necessarily secure your mother a better outcome than the spare attentions she might get in South Dakota or Maine."}
{"text": "The Well Guide: How to Start Running\nWant to start a new running habit? We make it easy to get started, get inspired and stay on track. Are you ready? Lets go!\n\nSign up for our running email.Can fat-soled shoes that appear to have been constructed in part from marshmallows help you run better? The first study of a new kind of thickly cushioned running shoe suggests that this type of footwear may not make running any easier. But it probably also will not make it harder. And nobody knows yet whether these maximalist running shoes, as theyre called, are the answer to preventing the painful injuries that sideline as many as 90 percent of runners at some point.Anyone who hangs out with distance runners has doubtless noticed the sudden popularity of these shoes, which provide two or three times as much foam padding between the foot and the pavement as most running shoes. The voluptuous Hoka One One shoes are perhaps the most recognizable of the new maximalist footwear, but almost every athletic shoe company offers models now with similarly extreme padding.Maximalist shoes would seem to be a fervent reaction to and rebuke of the other recent fad in running-related footwear, which consisted of minimalist or barefoot-style shoes that provide little if any cushioning.But according to John Mercer, a professor of biomechanics at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, and senior author of the new study, both types of footwear were developed in response to the same concern: the desire to prevent running injuries.Many hoped that barefoot-style shoes, by removing most padding, would change how people run in beneficial ways. Researchers had noted that people who grow up running barefoot (which means, mostly, young Kenyan runners) typically strike the ground near the middle or front of their foot and tend to have relatively few injuries. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, that style of running would result in fewer injuries for the rest of us.So some runners began wearing flat, minimalist shoes that mimic running barefoot.But the results were not altogether salutary. No agency collects data about running injuries, but anecdotal reports suggest that quite a few barefoot-style runners wound up getting hurt, in part because their feet and legs were unused to the new patterns of pounding that occur when shoes provide little or no cushioning.Human nature being what it is, people then turned to shoes with far more cushioning than had been used in running shoes before.I first saw these extremely cushioned shoes being worn by ultra-runners and trail runners covering long distances, Dr. Mercer said. More recently, less intense runners have begun wearing the maximalist shoes, he said.These shoes promise plush comfort without a decrease in athletic performance, Dr. Mercer said. Rather surprising (to me), most maximalist shoes weigh about the same as thinner models, Dr. Mercer said, because the foam used for cushioning has a cotton-candy airiness.However, these shoes are still so new that scientists had not yet examined their effects on how people run.So for the new study, which was presented last week at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Boston, Dr. Mercer and his colleagues asked 10 experienced runners to eschew their usual shoes for a few days.At the universitys human performance lab, the runners donned alternately an average pair of running shoes and a pair of maximally cushioned shoes. They ran in each type of shoe at three different speeds and two different inclines on a treadmill, while wearing a mask that measured precisely how much oxygen the runner was taking in. Each run lasted eight to 10 minutes.If shoes make it more or less difficult to run, Dr. Mercer said, the amount of oxygen that a runner wearing those shoes breathes in should commensurately rise or fall.As expected, the runners all gasped in far more oxygen when they ran at higher speeds and increased slopes. But their footwear did not affect their oxygen intake. The runners required about the same amount of oxygen at the various paces and inclines whether they wore super-fat or average shoes.In other words, the maximalist shoes did not make running more tiring. But they also did not make it easier.The results might encourage some comfort-loving runners, like me, to consider trying the fat-soled shoes.But this study was quite small-scale and did not address the pressing issue of injuries. No one knows at this point whether wearing maximalist shoes will keep people from getting hurt, Dr. Mercer said. The shoes might, for example, turn out to contribute to certain injuries if their added height makes runners less stable or less able to feel and respond to changes in the ground beneath them.Dr. Mercer and his colleagues hope to study injury patterns from these shoes in the future.For now, the broader import of the studys findings could be that shoes may matter less for running ease than many of us might expect. So if you like your current shoes, stick with them. If, however, you do wish to try maximally  or minimally  cushioned shoes, visit your local running specialty store and wear a pair for a jog around the block to judge whether you enjoy how they feel.Related:Love running?

{"text": "WASHINGTON  A proposal by a senior House Republican to dismantle portions of the 2010 Wall Street reforms known as the Dodd-Frank Act has rekindled a partisan debate over the state of banking regulation eight years after the financial crisis.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, outlined the main parts of his plan on Tuesday during a speech in New York. He plans to introduce the legislation this month. The debate shows how divided Washington remains over how to supervise the financial industry, from the big banks to the small community institutions.Mr. Hensarlings plan, called the Financial Choice Act, builds on longstanding Republican hostility to the financial reform law, rolling back significant provisions and limiting the role of regulators in overseeing the countrys biggest banks. But it also advocates stronger penalties for financial fraud and puts a focus on capital buffers for large banks.Simply put, Dodd-Frank has failed, Mr. Hensarling said in remarks to the Economic Club of New York. Its time for a new legislative paradigm in banking and capital markets.After the speech, Mr. Hensarling planned to meet with the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, who has called for a repeal of Dodd-Frank. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Back in Washington, Democrats had sharp words for the plan. Weve only seen a summary of the bill so far, but even from that, its clear that Congressman Hensarling and his fellow Republicans think that the poor Wall Street banks have suffered too much under the new rules, and its time for them to return to the good old days before the 2008 crisis, when these banks could run wild, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said during a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.Senator Warren called the bill Congressman Hensarlings wet kiss for the Wall Street banks.Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the banking panel, said in a statement that the plan underscores the collective amnesia of many in Congress and on Wall Street about how devastating the financial crisis was for an entire generation of working and middle-class Americans.One of the plans central provisions would allow the countrys biggest banks to exempt themselves from capital and liquidity requirements and other regulatory standards if they held enough capital to surpass a certain threshold.Mr. Hensarling estimated that the biggest banks would be required to collectively raise several hundred billion dollars in new equity to benefit from the proposal.That is likely to dissuade many of the top financial institutions from offering broad support for the measure.Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, said, The nations largest banks are unlikely to throw their weight behind it, as they would have to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to benefit, and doing so would undermine the tens of billions they have already spent to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act.According to an outline released on Tuesday, the bill would also repeal the Volcker Rule, which restricts trading activities at banks, and replace the Dodd-Frank Acts process for winding down a failing institution with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code.On Tuesday, Mr. Hensarling said, I also would point out, regulators essentially bailed out Bear but let Lehman fail, references to Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, which ran into trouble around the time of the financial crisis. Although it was painful, somewhat chaotic, he continued, those in the bankruptcy arena would tell you the Lehman bankruptcy, to some extent, worked as it should have worked.The White House has been critical of the proposal, including changes to the process for dealing with distressed institutions.The proposal will allow big banks to go back making risky bets and put taxpayers on the hook once again for bailing out those banks to prevent a second Great Depression, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. That doesnt make any sense.The plan also takes aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of Ms. Warren. Mr. Hensarling proposes to restructure it and other agencies as bipartisan commissions and subject them to congressional appropriations.In addition, a body of regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council would lose its ability to designate risky nonbanks as systemically important. The legislation also includes a number of regulatory relief items for community banks, some of which are widely supported and others that have been opposed by Democrats.James Ballentine, executive vice president of congressional relations and political affairs for the American Bankers Association, said the group appreciated efforts to improve Dodd-Frank, though more details were needed.We really need to see the language on this bill. From the outline, there are several proposals, particularly in the regulatory relief area for community banks, that weve advocated for quite some time, he said.As Mr. Hensarling delivered his speech, a handful of protesters stood outside, asserting that he had received millions of dollars in campaign funding from major banks in his role as chairman of the powerful House banking panel. In a statement, the group, Take on Wall Street, called the bill a free pass for the financial services industry. It is backed by several labor organizations and grass-roots networks.Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California and the ranking member on the House committee, said the plan immediately takes two steps backward by eliminating any oversight of the riskiest activities at banks and nonbanks by dismantling the Financial Stability Oversight Council and subjecting bank regulators to the appropriations process.For now, the proposal remains a messaging tool for House Republicans, one that might influence the presidential debate.There is much that Donald Trump has said and done with which I disagree, but one thing I do agree with is that it is time to rebuild and replace Dodd-Frank, Mr. Hensarling said."}
{"text": "Youve a fine singing voice, Mr. Joyce, Nora Barnacle says alluringly to the handsome writer, and that must be why were here: James Joyce, the experimental modernist, was a lovely tenor, too.Thats true, and so is this: When they first had sex, he marked the occasion by composing an off-color song. So a musical retelling of their life together  their decades as an unwed couple, then marriage in middle age to protect their childrens inheritance  makes a certain kind of sense.Himself and Nora, Jonathan Brielles conventional new musical at the Minetta Lane Theater, is a curious means of going about it, though. The shows aesthetic is in no way Joycean or even very Irish, save the occasional flute or snippet of step dancing, and while Joyce (Matt Bogart) and Nora (Whitney Bashor) spend much of their lives in exile, these versions of them feel exiled only to the American musical stage.On Paul Tate dePoo IIIs somewhat hulking set, which does no favors to the baffling lighting (by Jason Lyons), Joyce is frequently shadowed by a priest (Zachary Prince). Go where you will, but I will always be with you, the priest says. He is meant, of course, to represent the voice of Joyces Roman Catholic upbringing, of Ireland, of all the strictures Joyce strains against. But Michael Bushs production, which uses a cast of five, cant quite figure out what to do with the priest, so he becomes a joke that usually doesnt work.Mr. Bogart makes a likable but hardly magnetic Joyce, and Ms. Bashor a lively and appealing Nora. Yet I had trouble buying them as a pair of early-20th-century iconoclasts, or even as a couple with a supposedly irresistible sexual spark. During one musical number (the choreography is by Kelli Barclay), they mime passion for each other with striking dispassion.They do better in Act II, whose highlights are Noras reprise of What Better Thing, a celebration of longtime love, and a duet between Joyce and Noras children, Lucia (Lianne Marie Dobbs) and Giorgio (Mr. Prince), about being the beloved progeny of the famous Mr. Joyce.The offspring get pretty short shrift, though. Nodding to Ulysses in the first few minutes, Himself and Nora is most interested in Joyces career, telling us repeatedly that Nora  the inspiration for his Molly Bloom  was more source than muse.Rumor has it, he writes your very words, the publisher Sylvia Beach (Ms. Dobbs), of Shakespeare & Company, says.I think Im funnier than what he writes, Nora answers, and good for her.But it is hard to feel the import of any of this in a show so foreign in style and spirit to Joyces writing and the couples own milieu. Nothing here challenges the mind."}
{"text": "UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif.  Senator Bernie Sanders plans to lay off at least half of his campaign staff Wednesday as his battered presidential bid continues despite Hillary Clintons being declared the presumptive Democratic nominee, two people close to the campaign said Tuesday.Many of those being laid off are advance staff members who often help with campaign logistics, as well as field staff members who have been working to garner votes for the senator, according to a campaign official and a former campaign staff member, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. Some campaign workers may move into jobs at Mr. Sanderss Senate office, but others will be terminated, they said.Word of the layoffs came on a night that Mrs. Clinton declared that she had captured the majority of pledged delegates needed to capture the Democratic nomination, despite a spirited fight from Mr. Sanders, who has showed no signs of ending his campaign.Mr. Sanders insists that he is prepared to challenge Mrs. Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in July, holding out hope that his lobbying of superdelegates  party officials and state leaders who cast their final votes at the convention  will siphon support from Mrs. Clinton as he makes his case that he is a stronger candidate against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.Mr. Sanderss spokesman, Michael Briggs, said Tuesday that Mr. Sanders planned to travel to his home in Vermont on Wednesday and then head to Washington on Thursday. Campaign aides say he plans to hold rallies in Washington, which holds the last nominating contest on June 14.Word of the cutbacks came a day after The Associated Press declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee. And Tuesday night Mrs. Clinton won a commanding victory in the New Jersey primary, widening her delegate lead over Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanderss campaign, once a fund-raising juggernaut, saw a significant decline in donations after Mr. Sanders lost a series of important primaries in the Northeast in April."}

{"text": "The New York City Education Department has a pattern of discrediting and punishing victims of sexual assault, particularly if they are black and poor, according to two complaints filed in recent days with the United States Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights.The complaints were filed by Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer in Brooklyn, on behalf of two girls and their mothers. A previous complaint filed by Ms. Goldberg in November on behalf of a third girl and her mother is currently being investigated by the Office for Civil Rights.One of the complaints, filed on June 1, states that on Feb. 5, a 15-year-old girl with developmental delays and an I.Q. of 71 was walking through a hallway at Teachers Preparatory High School in Brooklyn when seven boys confronted her and directed her into a stairwell. There, the complaint says, two of the boys forced her to perform oral sex on them while the others watched.Six days later, the girl reported the encounter to a guidance counselor and was interviewed by administrators and police officers, the complaint states. According to a report made by an assistant principal in the city departments Online Occurrence Reporting System that day, included in the complaint, the girl said that one of the boys grabbed her face and made her perform oral sex on him.The next day, however, the assistant principal interviewed the girl again, this time in the presence of one of the boys who had watched the encounter. Based on that interview, the assistant principal concluded that the sex had been consensual and updated the online occurrence report to say that upon further investigation the student admitted it was a consensual act not forced. As a result, the girl was given a suspension for six days for engaging in sexual acts on campus.After a hearing a month later, the suspension was withdrawn and the city Education Department said it would be expunged from her record. But the complaint says that the students mental health and academic performance have suffered, and that she lives in fear both of retaliation by her assailants and of the prospect that school administrators will again seek to punish her for another imaginary crime.The second complaint, filed on June 4, states that on Nov. 5, a 13-year-old student at Middle School 584 in Brooklyn was between classes when a male student punched her in the genital region, causing her to fall. The male student then simulated sex on top of her, with her arms pinned to the ground and her school uniform riding up.The male student was suspended for a month and then returned, at which point the girl became afraid to go to school, the complaint states. Despite the schools claim that it would separate the students, it did not, and they had three classes, as well as lunch, gym and music, together. The girls mother sought a safety transfer, but rather than expedite the request, the department took nearly seven weeks to find a new school for her, the complaint asserts. One school to which the girl wanted to transfer, which her sister attended, required an audition, and she was rejected. Two other schools that department officials at first suggested might take her subsequently said they could not enroll her. The complaint said the girl might be forced to repeat her grade because of the number of days of school she missed while waiting to be transferred.The complaint filed in November states that on April 2, 2015, a 13-year-old girl who was in eighth grade at Spring Creek Community School was waiting for the bus after school when a male student dragged her into an alleyway and sexually assaulted her, forcing her into anal and oral sex. The male student made a video of the encounter and subsequently disseminated it among other students, and the girl, who was already traumatized by the assault, became the subject of taunts and harassment, the complaint says. In response, the school principal told the girl to stay home from school because her presence would only make things worse, the complaint says. She missed nearly a month of school before a safety transfer was approved.Ms. Goldberg said in an interview that when she filed the first case, she thought it was an aberration, but after learning about the two other cases, she now believes there is a pattern within the citys Education Department of indifference to the needs of black victims of sexual assault.The department has one coordinator responsible for ensuring the districts compliance with Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination in federally financed schools. Ms. Goldberg called that inadequate.In the two recent complaints, Ms. Goldberg asked the federal Education Department to conduct a joint investigation with the Department of Justice into whether the citys Education Department violated Title IX by depriving the students of the benefits of an education and retaliating against them for making complaints of sexual assault. She also asked the federal Education Department to review the adequacy of the citys Title IX resources and mandate that the city department publicly release statistics regarding the number of sexual assaults that are reported, the number of cases that are investigated, their outcomes, and the frequency of victims being transferred.A spokeswoman for the city department said school staffs were trained in the departments policies on sexual assault reporting.Our legal team is reviewing these deeply troubling complaints and will respond to the Office for Civil Rights regarding any pending matters, the spokeswoman, Devora Kaye, said. Nothing is more important than the safety of all students and staff, and we have policies in place that ensure that incidents are reported, investigated and appropriately addressed."}
{"text": "Can genetically engineered mice save Nantucket from the scourge of Lyme disease?If the 10,000 residents of the Massachusetts island did not have such a soft spot for deer, they might not be entertaining the prospect, which could provide the groundwork for an even more exotic approach to controlling tick-borne diseases on the mainland.But popular opinion has long opposed public health officials recommendation of radically reducing the population of deer that serve as a food source for ticks carrying the Lyme pathogen and a convenient place for adult females to lay their eggs.The people who get sick yell and scream at me for not doing anything about it, said Malcolm MacNab, the chairman of the Nantucket Board of Health, and the others yell and scream at me because I want to kill the deer. Dr. MacNab said nearly 40 percent of Nantucket residents had had Lyme disease.So when he heard that Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wanted to gauge the islands interest in a new approach, he invited the scientist to present it at a public meeting on Monday.Although deer help spread ticks that carry Lyme, Dr. Esvelt explained to about two dozen residents at the meeting, the disease can also be controlled earlier in the ticks food chain. Ticks typically contract the pathogen from white-footed mice, which they often feed on while still larvae, passing it on to humans and other mice when they bite again.Using new genome-engineering tools, he proposes to create mice that are immune to the Lyme-causing pathogen, or to a protein in the ticks saliva, or both, to break the cycle of transmission.If that worked  and there is reason to think it would  he would then apply for permission to release thousands of the mice on a smaller, uninhabited island. If the number of infected ticks proved to be sufficiently reduced after two years, Nantucket could be next. The release of a few hundred thousand engineered mice over the course of about a year, Dr. Esvelt said, would ensure a stable population of resistant mice.There is no company behind the project, which Dr. Esvelt estimated could take as long as a decade to complete. But he said he thought he could get government and philanthropic funding because it would provide evidence that might justify the use of another technology he has helped to pioneer, called gene drive, to attack Lyme disease elsewhere.In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, the areas of the United States where Lyme is most prevalent, it would not be feasible to release enough engineered mice to spread the genes for Lyme immunity through the native mouse population.An effort on that scale would require the addition of a gene drive, which ensures that a given gene is passed to all of an organisms offspring rather than the usual half.Gene drive technology is complicated because it has the capacity to alter an entire population of a given species, without any sure means of being canceled out if it has unforeseen consequences. It has been used only in laboratory experiments.Dr. Esvelt said he wanted some indication of community support even before he started looking for Lyme immunity genes in laboratory mice  because he believes any effort to alter an ecosystem should not go forward without it, and because it would cost tens of millions of dollars. Ultimately, the proposal would need approval from federal and state regulators, as well as a majority of Nantuckets citizens.Is this a project you might wish to pursue? he asked on Monday. Dr. MacNab, who had anticipated some opposition to the idea, braced himself as Danica Connor, who identified herself as an herbalist, took the microphone.Im the first person to say if you go tinker with Mother Nature, were going to break it, she said. But you know what? Even I want to see where you go with this.Nantucket may have competition. Dr. Esvelt said he is scheduled to make a similar presentation on nearby Marthas Vineyard in July."}
{"text": "Putting graphic pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages was required by a law passed in 2009, but a tobacco company convinced a federal appellate court to delay implementation, claiming there was no evidence that pictures helped people quit.Now a randomized controlled trial, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, has provided the evidence.In a four-week trial, 2,149 smokers were randomly assigned to use packs of cigarettes with either pictorial or text-only warnings. At the end of each week, researchers surveyed the participants about their smoking.The two groups had the same baseline desire to quit and similar understanding of the harms of smoking. But by the end of the study, 40 percent of those in the pictorial warning group had quit for at least a day, and 5.7 percent were not smoking during the seven days before their final interview, compared with 34 percent and 3.8 percent respectively in the text-only group.The pictorial warnings were more effective for both sexes and across races, ethnicities and socioeconomic levels.This is the first well-controlled study that demonstrates a change in behavior, said the lead author, Noel T. Brewer, a professor of health behavior at the University of North Carolina. Its time for the U.S. to adopt pictorial warnings. Delaying is causing people to continue smoking and die as a result."}

{"text": "The first season of The Americans ended with high and violent drama  Elizabeth walked into an F.B.I. trap and was shot, and Claudia carried out a revenge assassination. On Wednesday night, Season 4 ended with the F.B.I. trying to spring another trap. But in keeping with the troubled lassitude that marked the whole season, the consequences were muted, and more depressing than violent. William, trapped by the Feds, infected himself with the Lassa virus and surrendered peacefully. Arkady was given 48 hours to leave the country. In the shows version of a cliffhanger, Philip and Elizabeth were left wondering whether it was time to pull up stakes and take the children to Moscow. (In the Season 1 finale, their Plan B if Elizabeth was caught was for Philip to take the kids to Canada. Montreal might look pretty good to Paige and Henry before long.)In his summation of this season, my colleague James Poniewozik called it masterly and melancholy, and the finale, Persona Non Grata, stayed true to that spirit right through to the end. As William lay dying  the putrefaction of his insides probably sped by his violent laughter when Agent Aderholt, exhibiting well-meaning American cluelessness, asked if he wanted a Coke  he coughed up, in his delirium, one tiny bit of information to add to Stan and Denniss hazy picture of the Jenningses. He wished he could be like them  a pretty wife, a lucky husband, a couple of kids, living the American dream. (Looking back to the end of Season 1 again, Stan will certainly connect this to the sketch of the married couple who forced a cleaning lady to bug Caspar Weinbergers office.) The final scene captured the grim paradox of Williams description: the Jenningses dream home looming over Philip and Paige in the dark, a repository of secrets, lies and deadly peril.The episode wrapped up the biological weapons plotline  another long, expensive, dangerous operation carried out for no good reason  while planting seeds for the shows final two seasons. Paige and Philip were angry with each other because Stan had reported, gleefully, that Paige and Stans son Matthew had been making out while watching the Super Bowl. Philip, having just been told by Gabriel that they should consider going home because the risks were piling up, was in no mood for indulging teenage hormones. Dont do this, Paige, he said. You have no idea. No idea. She has no idea because her parents are still shielding her from the truth, and now well see whether she defies them over Matthew. Meanwhile, she continued to demonstrate her interest in her parents work, asking Elizabeth to teach her some self-defense moves (so Mom wont have to stab anyone in the neck to protect her) and overruling Elizabeth on how to respond to the birth of Alice and Pastor Tims daughter.In a scene that sat apart from the episodes action but was central to the seasons themes, Philip got up at an EST meeting and bared his soul, saying of his job, Every morning I wake up with this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. (He was ostensibly talking about his job as a travel agent, which was funny since he actually seems to enjoy making peoples travel arrangements.) The EST instructor countered by asking why he didnt just quit  Do you think the world would stop spinning? Because I got news for you. You aint that important.The discovery of William was the straw that broke the F.B.I.s back, on top of the bugging of Agent Gaads office, the turning of his secretary and the accidental killing of Gaad. The gentlemanly rules of espionage had been abused and someone had to be punished, in this case Arkady. He wasnt the only K.G.B. operative heading home  Oleg asked for a transfer home to be with his distraught mother. When Oleg broke the news to Tatiana, she bit back her tears and called him a good son, just as Arkady had earlier. That was a bit rich, given that Olegs betrayal of the biological weapons operation led to Arkadys expulsion (not to mention Williams death).Oleg as good son  in the plush, pampered confines of the rezidentura  provided a sharp contrast for the episodes one big twist, the introduction of Philips Soviet son, Mikhail Semenov, or Mischa. After first seeing him in a mental hospital where he had been confined for publicly criticizing the war in Afghanistan, we last saw him preparing to come to the United States (with money and passports left for him by his K.G.B. agent mother, Irina, before her death) to find Philip. It seems unlikely that this will be a good thing. Also, does Philip know that his former lover and his sons mother is dead? Gabriel told him that she was going on trial for desertion, but I dont recall hearing more until this episode  tell me if Im wrong.Random Thoughts Did the F.B.I. bungle yet another operation, moving in on William too early and missing the chance to bag Philip, who was waiting on a park bench for the Lassa virus handoff? Stan made the call that William had broken off the meet, but it wasnt clear to me that he had. Arkadys slighting reference to the Soviet domestic intelligence agency  he told Oleg that its work wouldnt be up to his standards  sounded like a coded dig at its American counterpart. In a lot of other shows, Gabriels (unfounded) worries about Williams loyalty would have led to an attempt to kill him in his highly secure biocontainment room. It says something about The Americans that you never even considered the possibility that theyd go there. Once again, an F.B.I. operation was a showcase for what had to be the worst period in American automotive design. Leonard Cohens Who by Fire, a meditation on the many ways we might die, was used under a scene in which Paige visited Alice in the hospital. While Pastor Tim held the new baby, Mr. Cohen droned, Who by something blunt, and who by avalanche, who by powder, and the action cut to Elizabeth and Philip silently climbing into their car, having just been told they should escape before death and the F.B.I. catch up to them. And if weve seen the last of Arkady and Oleg, it will be a shame, because Lev Gorn and Costa Ronin have both been excellent as spies with consciences. Let us know what you thought of Persona Non Grata, and of the fourth season of The Americans, in the comments. Where were you on Jan. 22, 1984, when the Washington Redskins were blown out in the Super Bowl, 38-9, by the Los Angeles Raiders?"}

More than 40 percent withheld votes for the eight directors put forward by the company, publisher of The Los Angeles Times. That is virtually unheard of, especially when proxy advisers like Institutional Shareholder Services favor the candidates.As with other unlikely situations, such as Walt Disneys investor revolt in 2004, the squeals of jilted minorities can kick directors into action. This should be embarrassing enough for Tribunes board to force its tin-eared chairman, Michael W. Ferro Jr., to listen to Gannetts overtures.Tribune, which also owns The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant and The Chicago Tribune in its hometown, has twice rebuffed offers  the latest at $15 a share in cash, double what investors previously thought it was worth  from Gannett, the largest American newspaper chain.Gannett missed the window to nominate its own set of directors but instead started a vote-withholding campaign against Tribunes nominees. At least two-fifths of Tribunes owners went along, according to a filing released Monday. Exclude the 17 percent stake held by Mr. Ferro and a few other insiders, and the number of withheld votes climbs just above a majority and even toward 60 percent for some board candidates, a Breakingviews analysis shows.Thats a remarkable rebuke given the outsize impact of I.S.S. A joint paper from the University of Colorado, Columbia University and the University of Zurich about the advisers influence on uncontested director elections found that less than 1 percent of board elections resulted in more than 20 percent of the owners withholding their votes unless I.S.S. advised them to do so. Over a decade ago, after 43 percent of shareholders at Walt Disney didnt cast a vote for Michael Eisner, then the chairman, the board stripped him of his title.Tribune says it is open to discussions with Gannett. But directors are busy with other tasks, such as changing the corporate name to the risible Tronc to reflect its new direction as a digital-content curator.

{"text": "E-Trade Financial, the brokerage firm that rose to prominence in the internet start-up boom of the late 1990s by peddling the ease of active online trading, is introducing a so-called robo-advisory service.It will be the latest big financial company to chase the billions of dollars that have poured into automated investing in the last few years.Unlike the self-directed investing that E-Trade Financial once championed, robo-investing, for the most part, embraces a set it and forget it approach, using exchange-traded funds and automatic portfolio updating. Popularized in the last five years by digital platforms like Betterment and Wealthfront and initially aimed at young professionals, the concept has shaken the traditional wealth management industry and forced nearly every major bank, fund company and brokerage firm to develop its own offering.The new federal rules for companies that manage investor money are expected to encourage a rush to low-cost investments, something the robo advisers claim as their hallmark. The rules may also hasten formal partnerships between traditional banks and brokerage firms and the financial technology firms that have built robo-investing platforms. Robo advisers and other digital platforms had $53 billion of investor assets at the end of last year, according to Aite Group, up from $2 billion at the end of 2013.On Tuesday, E-Trade will introduce Adaptive Portfolio, a product line that uses a combination of stock and bond exchange-traded funds and actively managed mutual funds to create baskets that are weighted according to an investors risk preferences and investment goals. People entering through E-Trades website answer a series of questions and are sorted into one of six risk categories and corresponding model portfolios based on their answers.It is a bit of a twist on the offerings of rival firms, which only offer exchange-traded funds. E-Trade customers can pick whether they want pure E.T.F. portfolios or those with a mix of E.T.F.s and mutual funds. We aim to kick-start a new phase in the automated investing evolution by offering investors access to more strategies to help them meet their goals, said Lena Haas, E-Trades senior vice president of retirement, investing and savings.Just last month, UBSs giant American wealth management division announced plans to use a robot to cater to its wealthy clients. Its 7,000 advisers are using technology developed by a San Francisco start-up, SigFig Wealth Management. SigFigs technology is supposed to increase production for UBS advisers, taking over portfolio management duties so the advisers can spend more time talking to clients.

{"text": "NAIROBI, Kenya  A day after deadly protests rocked several areas of Kenya, government security officials issued a decree on Tuesday banning all unlawful demonstrations.Joseph Nkaisserry, Kenyas interior minister, said protesters armed with stones, machetes and other crude weapons had caused heightened political tension, disruption of peace and loss of livelihoods affecting thousands of ordinary Kenyans.As a result, Mr. Nkaisserry warned, from today, the Government prohibits all unlawful demonstrations in the country.What exactly unlawful means and how this decree differs from what the government already had the right to do remained unclear.Kenyas opposition leaders have been organizing regular protests on Mondays, to many Kenyans chagrin. The opposition leaders immediately rejected the ban as unconstitutional.Kenyas courts may have to decide the appropriate balance between protecting security and allowing free expression. On several occasions, the courts have sided with Kenyas opposition, affirming its right to hold peaceful protests.On Monday, demonstrations erupted in several parts of the country. Many protesters were peaceful, singing as they marched through downtown Nairobi, the capital, but others in its slums burned tires and barricaded roads.In Kisumu, in western Kenya, the police battled mobs, shooting several people. The government said on Tuesday that 50 people had been injured and two killed, and it blamed the protesters for the violence. Witnesses in Kisumu said police officers had opened fire on a crowd, hitting a 5-year-old boy in the back. He was hospitalized and his condition was listed as critical.Kenyas opposition has been mobilizing supporters to press the government to disband the national election commission, which is widely viewed as biased and corrupt. President Uhuru Kenyatta has refused to do so, and opposition leaders have threatened to increase their protests to two and then four times a week.The protests have scared away business and tourists. One Kenyan investment adviser in Nairobi, Aly-Khan Satchu, has estimated that the country loses the equivalent of $5 million each day the protesters take to the streets, because of interruptions to commerce, the closing of businesses and the destruction of property.Kenya is scheduled to hold a presidential election next year, and many Kenyans worry that the disruptions, anxiety and violence that usually surround elections have already begun."}

{"text": "The Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, renowned for its collection of postwar painting, announced that it had selected the architectural firm OMA to expand and refurbish the museum, an $80 million project and the largest ever undertaken by a cultural organization in Western New York.The expansion, which has been under discussion for a decade, will be the first museum project in the United States by OMA, the firm founded by Rem Koolhaas, which has created some of the most distinctive buildings and interiors in the world over the last four decades. Shohei Shigematsu, a principal of the firm based in New York, will oversee the project. The firm was chosen after an international competition, and the decision was approved Monday night by a vote of the museums board.Over the next year, we will work together to imagine a renewed Albright-Knox for the twenty-first century, one that includes state-of-the-art spaces for special exhibitions and the display of our world-renowned collection, said the museums director, Janne Sirn, in a statement.The museum said the expansion was sorely needed because a chronic shortage of space has limited the display and preservation of its masterworks.Since the museums last expansion in 1962 the collection has quadrupled in size and now contains more than 8,000 works, only 200 to 300 of which can be shown at one time, said the museum, which has been actively acquiring contemporary works since raising millions in 2007 through the de-accession of a collection of antiquities and medieval and Renaissance art, a decision that angered some museum patrons at the time.The expansion project will be developed in close communication with the city and the museums neighbors, the museum said, to take a comprehensive view of the museums place within Frederick Law Olmsteds Delaware Park as a celebrated cultural resource in our region and as a vital contributor to Western New Yorks resurgence."}
{"text": "As Republican candidates began televised debates last summer, the Republican campaign strategist Mike Murphy invented a term for Donald J. Trump: zombie front-runner.Mr. Murphy, the architect of the campaign of Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, insisted that voters would tire of Mr. Trumps antics and gravitate toward conventional candidates in the Republican primaries.It never happened.Now the longtime strategist is watching, like everyone else, to see what Mr. Trump will do next. And he replays what he might have done to block the rise of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who has his party on edge five months before Election Day.The pro-Bush super PAC that Mr. Murphy directed had more than $100 million to do it with. Some Republican peers have argued that he should have used the money to blast Mr. Trump from the start, but Mr. Murphy insists that would have only benefited rivals like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.We go blast Trump early, wed move a lot of numbers to Cruz, a few to Rubio, Mr. Murphy said.He regrets not proposing a joint attack on the systemic threat posed by Mr. Trump, but, in any case, he doubts super PACs that favored other candidates would have agreed.Our plan was to clobber him later, Mr. Murphy explained. Well, we never got to later.By late summer, Mr. Murphy worried that Mr. Bushs temperate, cerebral style was the opposite of what a decisive bloc of primary voters wanted.Mr. Trump seized a larger-than-ever grievance electorate, as Mr. Murphy called it, while adroitly tagging Mr. Bush as low energy.It wasnt about energy; it was about tone, Mr. Murphy said. It was a smart way for Trump, and his kind of weird savant gift he has to craft good insults, to take what was Jebs strength as a president and make it a minus in the circus reality show of our debates.He consoles himself with the fact that we never said anything were ashamed of, and he praises Mr. Bush for joining his brother, his father and the 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, in refusing to endorse Mr. Trump.Its a pretty small list of people who are publicly willing to say, This guy should not be president of the United States,  Mr. Murphy said. Ive been surprised at the magnetic field of blind party loyalty, and a little disappointed by it.Mr. Trump has embarrassed Republican leaders most recently by invoking the Mexican heritage of the judge presiding over a lawsuit charging that Trump University defrauded students. Mr. Murphy advises vulnerable Republican congressional candidates to brace for more.Theyre thinking, All right, Ive got primary voters who love Trump,  he said.  And Ive got swing voters who cant stand the guy, who I need to win.A lot of them are going to get in trouble because theyll get close to him, theyll back off, and itll be inconsistent  which will not help.Mr. Trump has hired experienced Republican handlers from the conventional campaign circles that Mr. Murphy has traveled in for a quarter-century.The strategist Paul J. Manafort and the pollster Tony Fabrizio will help navigate the campaigns transition to the general election.They know how to do the basic mechanics, Mr. Murphy said. But ultimately its all about Trump. They cant change him.Mr. Trump must appeal to a vastly larger and more diverse group of voters than in Republican primaries. His tactics so far  including controversial comments about women, Mexican immigrants and Muslims  have alienated many Americans. A New York Times/CBS News poll in May reported that 55 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of him.To win, Mr. Trump would have to dramatically change the perception people have of him now, Mr. Murphy said.He doubts that is possible, and thats why he still considers Mr. Trump a zombie candidate.Hes the strength of the Trump campaign, Mr. Murphy concluded, and hes the fatal flaw."}
{"text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio  A federal judge blocked certain requirements for how thousands of ballots are counted in Ohio, saying in a decision on Tuesday that the policies are unconstitutional and violate the Voting Rights Act.At issue are two laws the Republican-led legislature passed in 2014 and how they are carried out.Among other changes, the laws require voters to provide certain identifying information when casting absentee or provisional ballots. Voters must include their name, signature, valid forms of identification, address and birth date. Ballots from legitimate voters could be rejected because of errors or omissions.Provisional ballots are those cast when a voters identity or registration is in question. The voters eligibility is verified later.The judge, Algenon L. Marbley of United States District Court, said the laws could harm black voters in particular.The Ohio General Assembly took action after the disastrous 2004 election to expand voters access to absentee and provisional balloting, the decision said, and the rollback of these improvements will disproportionately harm African-American voters.Advocates for the homeless and the Ohio Democratic Party had sued the states secretary of state, Jon Husted, a Republican, saying the laws and procedures created hurdles for voters, particularly minorities.Lawyers for the state said the laws were reasonable and nondiscriminatory and imposed a minimal burden on voters. Judge Marbley found otherwise.The judge blocked Mr. Husted from requiring full and accurate completion of absentee- and provisional-ballot forms before otherwise qualified voters ballots could be counted. He also blocked sections that reduced the time voters could correct errors and prohibited poll worker assistance.Mr. Husted said he would appeal the decision, which came two weeks after another federal judge ruled that a state law reducing early voting was unconstitutional.The sad reality is that much of Ohios election laws are no longer made by their elected representatives, but rather by unelected federal judges in response to politically motivated lawsuits, Mr. Husted said in a statement.In trial and in court documents, the states lawyers cited election data that showed acceptance rates for such ballots improved after the laws were put in place in 2014. They said the laws helped register unregistered voters and update voter registration information and had made more votes count.The State of Ohio has been held accountable again for disenfranchising legitimate voters, said a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Subodh Chandra.The judge heard testimony from county elections officials, election experts and others during a bench trial in March.Also on Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit delivered an incremental victory for critics of Republican-engineered changes to North Carolinas elections procedures.In a brief order, the court said North Carolina could not, at least for now, enforce its recent rollbacks of same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting. The appeals court, which sits in Richmond, Va., will hear arguments about North Carolinas practices on June 21, nearly two months after a federal judge upheld the procedures."}
{"text": "THURSDAY PUZZLE  Be very quiet. Damon Gulczynski is back and hes asking us to be SILENT. Thats good, because it sets a very meditative tone for solving his puzzle.Today were all about being SILENT. In fact, the shaded/circled letters that run diagonally down the grid spell out SILENT. We also have SILENT PARTNERS (at 21A) and the SILENT MAJORITY (at 49A), but wait, as a wise man once said, theres more. Those shaded/circled letters happen to be silent in the Across entries.Pretty nifty, if not a little on the taciturn side. Watch out for X of Y clues. At 17A, the clue is Pair of big jets? and, at first, I thought this was literally about two big jets. I got AISLES from the crossings and scratched my head. Turns out that we are being asked to think of a pair of something that is in  or of  jets. And sure as shootin, there are two AISLES in big jets. Get to know singer ANI DiFranco and her recording label Righteous Babe Records. With her short first name and its vowel-consonant-vowel pattern, youll see her come up a lot in crosswords. A piece designed to sway opinion is an OP-ED (19A). Didnt see that one coming, did you? A juicy ending might be a great way to wrap of a movie, but in todays puzzle, were being asked to think of a suffix for something juicy. In this case, it would be -ADE, as in lemonADE or limeADE. I wanted TARTUFO instead of TORTONI. It fits, I already had the two Ts and theyre both Italian desserts. Such is life.  Hands up if you had COLORIST before COLORING at 4D. Me too. I had MEZCAL before MESCAL. Thank goodness for those AISLES at 17A, which are definitely not AISLEZ. If you happen to have a particularly large musical wheelhouse, you probably know that the key of E MAJOR consist of the pitches E, F sharp, G sharp, A, B, C sharp and D sharp. This wasnt a tricky clue for me (I have a Broadway show wheelhouse the size of a McMansion), but it is a good opportunity to mention LIN-Manuel Mirandas Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway show Hamilton, which none of us will be lucky enough to see in our lifetimes because it is next to impossible to procure tickets.And, on that note, lets hear from our constructor.I got the idea for this puzzle while simultaneously watching Mel Brookss Silent Movie and listening to Queensrches Silent Lucidity on continuous loop.  Great way to spend a Friday evening, by the way.Initially I wanted the silent letters to work in both directions, but I quickly realized that wasnt going to work, as just getting silent letters in symmetrical Across entries proved challenging.  Also, initially I had different entries where PARTNERS and MAJORITY are.  I had synonyms for silent  NONVOCAL and UNVOICED, I believe  but those are pretty boring words, so I went with something livelier.The entry that gave me the most consternation was LLAMA; it really makes you question what exactly counts as a silent letter.  Is the first L silent, or the second L, or neither because LL is a common letter combination that together make an L sound (like how GH make an F sound in some words)?  Do the words CALL and BELL and HILL have a silent L at the end?  Ultimately, I deemed LLAMA was acceptable with the first L circled, since LL is not a commonly established letter combination at the *beginning* of a word, and we think of the first L, not the second L, as being the silent one.  And there is precedent: The Feb. 3, 2004, New York Times Crossword puzzle contained the entry SILENT L and the clue was Llamas head?  So if this ever gets adjudicated in court, Im confident a jury of my peers would rule in my favor.Im all for a first-L SILENT LLAMA, Mr. Gulczynski.Your thoughts?"}

This is indisputable, and Mr. Kerrey has acknowledged it.

That opportunity can take other, uncontroversial forms.Mr. Kerrey said he would step down if his chairmanship was detrimental to the project. Such a gesture would show self-respect and grace, and would be appreciated by the Vietnamese.The university must be an institution that is sensitive to the feelings of all Vietnamese, not an institution in Vietnam conceived and decided upon by Americans disregarding our self-respect and dignity.TON NU THI NINHHo Chi Minh City, VietnamThe writer is a former Vietnamese ambassador to the European Union."}

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Pokmon is about to leave the realm of pure fantasy and jump into the real world.Niantic  the maker of the smartphone game Ingress, which combines onscreen actions with physical locations that players must visit  is using similar concepts to build Pokmon Go, the latest installment in the best-selling Pokmon video game series.Like earlier Pokmon games, players will throw virtual balls to capture pocket monsters, or Pokmon. They can be used to defend gyms, where the creatures train to become stronger. Rivals can try to take over the gym by using their own monsters to attack the gyms protectors.But the new game will also force players to look beyond their screens and visit places in the real world. As in Ingress, places like parks, historical markers, libraries, churches and commuter stations will hold valuable items in the game, retrievable only when physically close to the locations. To hatch a new Pokmon from an egg, players will have to walk one kilometer, as measured by the smartphones sensors. The game will use the phones camera to show virtual Pokmon dancing near a park bench or hiding in a bush, trying to evade capture.Theres a lot of Ingress in it  the idea of building it around certain locations, and those locations are what give you the things that you need to play the game and where the action takes place, John Hanke, Niantics chief executive, said in an interview. But then this whole element of all the different Pokmon, and capturing them and battling with them, is, of course, new.Pokmon Go, which is being developed in partnership with the Pokmon Company, is now in field testing in the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. (If you want to join the test, the company is still accepting applications.) The final game is expected to be released later this year.One challenge for Niantic is to figure out how to keep players safe as they walk around to find point-scoring opportunities while looking at the game screen.In September, a devoted Ingress player in Ireland, Francis Maxwell, died while playing the game at night on an unlighted pier.For Pokmon Go, which will appeal to children as well as adults, Niantic is including features to discourage people from constantly staring at their phones.Vibrations will alert players to nearby Pokmon and locations in the game. For children playing with a parent, an optional wrist button can be paired with the phone, buzzing when there is something nearby and allowing players to capture Pokmon with a single click.Its designed to facilitate collaborative play between a parent and child, Mr. Hanke said."}
{"text": "Martin Creed, the British artist, was standing in the Park Avenue Armorys 55,000-square-foot drill hall one day last week when the curator Tom Eccles turned to him with a question. The two were watching a short film from Mr. Creeds new Mouth series, which will be the centerpiece of a retrospective that opens on Wednesday. The film, projected far larger than life, shows a distinguished-looking woman  the artists mother  opening her mouth in slow motion to reveal something white on her tongue.What is that? Mr. Eccles asked.Yogurt, said Mr. Creed.Yogurt, said Mr. Eccles.Yogurt promises to be one of the more innocuous substances on view when Mr. Creed takes over the armory for two months. Elsewhere in the exhibition, viewers will encounter films of people vomiting and of people defecating, along with a piano that opens and slams shut, an array of metronomes ticking at different speeds, and a room whose lights go on and off at one-second intervals. All are outpourings from Mr. Creeds psyche, a delicate but highly tuned instrument beset by odd compulsions and Freudian obsessions.Even the yogurt has implications: At the far end of the darkened drill hall is the armorys back door, a small, utilitarian portal set to open for a few seconds after every showing. The door, Mr. Eccles pointed out, is meant to suggest a body part that back doors have been known to represent before.Its pretty remarkable the armory is letting us do this, observed Mr. Eccles, who assembled the exhibition in partnership with Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries in London.Actually, the exhibition is in the spirit of earlier armory shows spotlighting off-center artists like Paul McCarthy and Christian Boltanski  both of which Mr. Eccles was involved in producing.The Back Door is also the title of Mr. Creeds exhibition, a sprawling affair that occupies the armorys entire main floor, including not just the drill hall and the small, bunkerlike rooms that flank it but the grandly decorated, late-19th-century period rooms on the buildings Park Avenue side. This is Mr. Creeds biggest exhibition in the United States, although he won the Turner Prize in 2001 and his work has been shown extensively in Britain, with numerous solo shows at Tate Britain and a career retrospective two years ago at the Hayward Gallery in the Southbank Center in London.In addition to films, videos, paintings, installations and interventions, Mr. Creed will provide live talks and music on the first four evenings of the exhibition. There will also be a troupe of roving musicians performing for the run of the show. Their purpose is not to provide entertainment so much as a subtle sense of direction: If they go somewhere, Mr. Creed explained, that means you can go there as well. He is not, it appears, much of a believer in signage.Theyre examples of people, he continued, speaking in a pleasing Scottish lilt. And hopefully, having examples of people in the show will help the people who come to the show  because they are people as well.Like many of Mr. Creeds distinctive observations, this is hard to argue with. Still, the likelihood is not so much that people wont know where to go, but that they wont know what to think when they get there. What to make of an artist whose signature work is an empty room with lights that go on and off at regular intervals?Annoyance is a not-uncommon reaction, though bemusement is a frequent response as well. Even the art world is conflicted. When Mr. Creed showed Work No. 227: The Lights Going On and Off at the Turner Prize exhibition, a well-known British painter responded by throwing eggs at the walls  and was banned from the Tate galleries for life. Critics have generally had more tempered responses. A writer in The Observer described Mr. Creeds work as walking a very fine line between the mindfully simple and the simple-minded. The critic Roberta Smith called it direct, irreverent and also clownish in The New York Times.It can get a little fun-housey, I know that, Mr. Eccles said. But the armory  built for the Gilded Age plutocrats who made up the National Guards so-called Silk Stocking Regiment  already was a fun house in a way. A place for people to play dress-up and to act out.In the 1880s and 90s, said Rebecca Robertson, the armorys president, they had chariot races, they gave each other trophies.The lights piece touched a nerve, Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate galleries and chairman of the Turner Prize jury, said in a telephone interview. When it was described, it seemed to be almost without value, but the experience of being there was very, very compelling. For that matter, so was the experience of hearing about it: Mr. Serota was in a taxi when the driver showed how the lights in his passenger compartment had been rigged to go on and off, and asked if he too would win the prize.Though the public may debate whether Mr. Creeds work qualifies as art, he makes no such claim. I feel bad to say Im an artist, because I dont really know what art is, he admitted, looking somewhat abashed. I would say Im a person who tries to do things and work in a field that is commonly known as art. I try and do things because I find life is difficult and I want to make it better. More bearable.Mr. Creeds plight? Having bad feelings, he said, when pressed for a diagnosis. Feeling bad. And maybe not necessarily knowing why. Feeling guilty as well. The problem with feelings is you cant bloody wash them away.Viewed as therapy, Mr. Creeds art perhaps makes more sense. The same compulsions that have him fiddling with a succession of wet wipes as he speaks can be identified in Work No. 2736, which consists of a group of cactuses lined up according to height, or Work No. 129: A Door Opening and Closing, which it does, ad infinitum. This impulse is present as well in his numbering system, which he began when he was in art school  with Work No. 3: Yellow Painting, because he was afraid it would seem arrogant to start with Work No. 1.I call them symptoms, Mr. Creed said of his obsessions, and of his works as well. He takes the comparison further: A lot of organized religions are basically systems that have been built up to help people divide the world up into good and bad, dirty and clean. The chaotic mess of the world is difficult to deal with.Even for Mr. Creed, however, unpacking the welter of feelings that shape his work can be difficult. Take The Lights Going On and Off: For years, his explanation for the piece was that there was nothing he could put in a room that seemed worthy of worship. So he would just use what was already there, like the light switch.But in the last year or so, he said, Ive been thinking that the real reason I made that work was because I used to love switching the lights on and off to annoy people  in particular, his parents, when they were in the bathroom, where the light switch was just outside the door. Plunging his mother or father into darkness during a private moment was great fun. The guilt would come later."}
{"text": "ALBANY  The chairman of the State Senates gambling committee said on Tuesday that legislative leaders in Albany had come to an agreement to legalize daily fantasy sports, potentially calming a fractious legal dispute and setting the stage for even wider acceptance of the popular online games.Senator John J. Bonacic, who heads the Committee on Racing, Gaming and Wagering, said late Tuesday that we have an agreed-upon bill, though it would still need to be passed by both houses of the State Legislature and signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, whose office said negotiations were continuing.Under the parameters of the deal outlined by Mr. Bonacic, companies like FanDuel and DraftKings would pay a $150,000 fee to operate in New York, or 1.5 percent of the previous years revenues, and turn over 15 percent of revenues to the state after prizes were awarded to players. The games  in which players create imaginary teams using players in real sports  would be classified as games of skill, not chance, an important legal distinction under a 2006 federal law governing online wagering.Its not gambling, Mr. Bonacic said.The deal could mark a dtente in a contentious battle that began last fall when the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, ordered DraftKings and FanDuel, the two biggest companies in the industry, to stop taking bets in the state, saying it was illegal gambling.The action by Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, was seen as a forceful rebuke of an industry that had flooded the airwaves with advertisements about fantasy sports, touting the fun and the potential for quick, lucrative wins. In recent months, other states have also acted to regulate the games, or deemed them to be illegal.But in a precursor to a deal in Albany, Mr. Schneiderman brokered agreements in March in which DraftKings and FanDuel agreed to stop taking bets from New York residents but included a deadline of June 30 for lawmakers to legalize the games. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for the attorney general, said that Mr. Schneiderman had made it clear that daily fantasy sports is illegal under current law.However, Mr. Mittenthal added, its up to the Legislature to craft or change those laws.And on Tuesday, that legalization seemed to be within reach. Mr. Bonacic, a Hudson Valley Republican, said the deal would generate $3.5 million to $5 million a year for the state.Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Fantasy Sports for All, an industry advocacy group, said companies were extremely appreciative of the work being done in the Legislature in support of the newest national pastime.Mr. Bonacic said that Mr. Cuomos office still needed to weigh in with technical amendments to the bill. But he, too, seemed hopeful that the legalization of daily fantasy sports would soon be a reality for their fans.They love the game, Mr. Bonacic said. So why would the State of New York not give them the opportunity to continue to play?"}
{"text": "When Donald Trump attacked a federal judge whose parents were born in Mexico, Hispanic Americans were outraged. Other minority groups saw a pattern of bigotry. Democrats had a hard time concealing their glee. Republican leaders pretended they disapproved.Well, to be fair, they did disapprove in a way  not because Trump believes the things he says, but because he says them so directly.Far too many Republicans share this kind of racism and have for a long time. Trump has just dispensed with dog whistles and revels in his bigotry instead. But this is the party the Republicans have been deliberately and assiduously building for many decades, the party of division and intolerance. George H.W. Bushs racist tactics in 1988 against Michael Dukakis  the Willie Horton ad in particular  seem almost genteel by comparison.Todays Republicans have stymied every effort at reforming immigration, at achieving true equality for women, at ending the scourge of racist drug laws and criminal sentencing rules. The Republican Party has generated a wave of laws designed to make it harder for black Americans and other minorities to vote. Its not that Republicans dont want to deport millions of Mexicans and ban Muslims from our shores. They just dont like to talk about it in the open.So when Donald Trump started to attack Mexicans, Muslims and anyone else who popped into his head, Republican leaders may have thought it was bad tactics. But all that talk this year about the Republican establishment being aghast at Trump for his outlandish ideas was nonsense.What really bothers Republicans is that Trump is not a member of their club and did not observe party discipline by saving his disdain for Democrats.None of Trumps Republican challengers, of course, had the vision, the guts or the personality to defeat him, and now its far too late. By the time Trump attacked Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is hearing one of the lawsuits against Trumps infomercial disguised as a university, the Republican leadership had long since painted itself into a corner.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, could not stir himself to call Trumps comments racist. McConnell said on Meet the Press last Sunday that he did not agree with Trump that the judge should recuse himself, but that was all the interviewer could get out of what passes for a statesman in the G.O.P. these days.Asked about one right-wing blogger who said Republicans were backing a racist candidate, McConnell simpered that what matters is winning the White House. The right-of-center world needs to respect the fact that the primary voters have spoken, he said.Yes, in favor of blatant intolerance.Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, who practically strained his back flipping from denouncing Trump to endorsing him, said that claiming a person cant do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed. Its absolutely unacceptable.Not so unacceptable that he is withdrawing his endorsement. I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than we do with her, he said, referring to Hillary Clinton.Senator Tim Scott, the highest-ranking black Republican, would not revoke his endorsement after what he called racially toxic comments.What about John McCain, whom Donald Trump once mocked for getting captured and tortured by the North Vietnamese? Surely he was outraged. Nope.One or two Republicans dissented, but most of them are on the outs with their party anyway. Bill Kristol, the neoconservative commentator who evidently loathes Trump, tweeted: Official position of the leadership of the Republican Party: Trump is an inexcusable bigot, and Trump must be our next president.Given the cowardice of his fellow members of the party of Lincoln, Trump is, naturally, doubling down on running for racist in chief.On Monday, Bloomberg Politics reported that Trump told campaign surrogates in a conference call to keep up the attack on Judge Curiel. And on Tuesday, he said in a statement, It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. His evidence for his tolerance was, as usual, that he has lots of Mexican-Americans working for him.Trump said he would not comment further on the lawsuit against Trump University or the judge. He doesnt have to. Mission accomplished, as George W. Bush might say. But he obviously plans to go on riding this tiger  because he thinks it will take him into the White House; because he is engaged in a creepy act of self destruction to avoid actually having to be president, which is hard work; or simply because he enjoys making bigoted comments.Supporters of Bernie Sanders who talk about voting for Trump instead of Clinton if their candidate finally decides to drop out should consider this latest episode, and Trumps larger pattern, carefully. They should know they would be voting for a racist."}
{"text": "THE Supreme Court will soon decide whether to hear an appeal in Tuaua v. United States, which poses the question of whether the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment applies to American Samoa. That this is a question at all is puzzling, and not just because its called American Samoa.The 14th Amendment to the Constitution guarantees citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. The United States annexed the eastern half of a group of Pacific islands known as the Samoas at the end of the 19th century. As a result, those islands became American Samoa. Surely, people born in American Samoa are legally speaking born in the United States and therefore citizens by birth. Easy, right?Not so easy. The answer is that no one knows for sure.How is it possible that a question as basic as who is a citizen at birth under our Constitution remains unresolved in a place subject to the sovereignty of the United States? To understand, you have to dive into the muck that is the law of the United States territories.When the United States closed the deal to annex American Samoa in 1899, it left open whether the islands had become part of the United States for purposes of citizenship. The previous year, the United States had defeated Spain in the Spanish-American War and had taken sovereignty over Spains former colonies  Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam.It was left to the Supreme Court to figure out the constitutional relationship between these new territories and the rest of the United States. In the rhetoric of the day, must the Constitution follow the flag? In the Insular Cases of 1901, the court handed imperialists a victory. According to Downes v. Bidwell, the new territories belonged to the United States but were not necessarily a part of it. They could be governed as colonies, with fewer constitutional constraints. The places affected by the courts ruling came to be known as unincorporated territories. Today, they include Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa.To be an unincorporated territory is to be caught in limbo: although unquestionably subject to American sovereignty, they are considered part of the United States for certain purposes but not others. Whether they are part of the United States for purposes of the Citizenship Clause remains unresolved.By statute, persons born in all of the unincorporated territories except American Samoa are citizens at birth: In American Samoa, you become a national, not a citizen. Congress originally refused to give the inhabitants of the new territories citizenship, but the court decided that they werent quite foreigners, either. Eventually, the State Department came up with the label nationals. Although Congress later extended statutory citizenship to other territories, American Samoans remained nationals, in part to accommodate their cultural distinctiveness.Yet if American Samoa is part of the United States under the 14th Amendment, then this arrangement obviously violates the Citizenship Clause.The painful colonial politics of the United States territories often feature deep internal divisions, further reducing their already weak leverage. The Tuaua case (in which I am an author of an amicus brief) is no exception. The American Samoan plaintiffs seeking constitutional birthright citizenship have found themselves at odds with the American Samoan government, which intervened in the case on the side of the United States.The plaintiffs in Tuaua, including several veterans of the American military, describe the discrimination American Samoans face if they move to the mainland United States (which as nationals they have the right to do). Because of their lack of citizenship, they are ineligible for many Civil Service jobs, disadvantaged in sponsoring family members for immigration and denied the right to vote.Yet the American Samoan government opposes citizenship for American Samoans on the ground that it would threaten their cultural practices  an argument more emotionally than legally compelling, since the constitutional provisions that could threaten these practices, like the First Amendments religion clauses, have nothing to do with birthright citizenship.The United States presumably has less interest in denying citizenship to American Samoans than in defending the validity of the underlying legal regime that was constructed to allow the United States to project power in its territories and abroad with fewer constitutional constraints.Whatever the answer to the question raised in Tuaua is, it is long overdue. To be subjected to uncertainty with respect to something as fundamental as ones citizenship is in and of itself a severe harm. Even in the other territories, where statutory birthright citizenship has provided a makeshift solution for many decades, doubt, confusion and anxiety over the extent to which citizenship is constitutionally guaranteed have persisted for more than a century.The 14th Amendment is supposed to protect people not only from arbitrary and unjust denials of their citizenship, but from uncertainty about whether they are citizens at all. Both the insult of second-class status and the injury of uncertainty are the ugly legal legacies of 19th century American expansionism. The court should hear the Tuaua appeal and clarify the scope of the Citizenship Clause once and for all."}

{"text": "Arlo Devlin-Brown, a veteran federal prosecutor in Manhattan who led a string of prominent Wall Street cases and more recently oversaw the prosecutions of two of New York States most powerful politicians, is departing for the private sector.In August, he will join the law firm Covington & Burling as a partner in New York, the firm said on Tuesday.Mr. Devlin-Browns departure caps a nearly 11-year tenure in the United States attorneys office for the Southern District of New York. Under Preet Bharara, the United States attorney there, Mr. Devlin-Brown took aim at JPMorgan Chase, SAC Capital and other Wall Street giants.He spent the last two years as chief of the public corruption unit, when it won the convictions of Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker; Dean G. Skelos, the former State Senate majority leader; and other public officials. Mr. Devlin-Brown is expected to be succeeded as the units chief by his deputy, Andrew D. Goldstein, 42, who joined the office in 2010.Mr. Devlin-Brown is the latest federal prosecutor to move through the so-called revolving door and land at Covington. The firms Washington office is already home to Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, as well as Lanny Breuer and Mythili Raman, each of whom ran the Justice Departments criminal division in Washington. Michael Chertoff, who also led the criminal division and later became secretary of homeland security, is of senior counsel to the firm.Mr. Devlin-Brown, 43, a native of Vermont, will increase the presence of former prosecutors in the New York office, whose partners include Alan Vinegrad, a former United States attorney in Brooklyn, and Nancy Kestenbaum, a former chief of the general crimes unit in Manhattan.Before joining the United States attorneys office, Mr. Devlin-Brown was an associate at the law firm Wilmer Hale.At Covington, Mr. Devlin-Brown will join the firms white-collar and investigations practice, and he could end up representing clients accused of the kinds of crimes he once prosecuted.As a senior prosecutor on Mr. Bhararas Wall Street task force, Mr. Devlin-Brown helped secure the insider trading conviction of Mathew Martoma, a former trader at the hedge fund SAC Capital. Mr. Martoma, who was accused of carrying out the largest insider trading scheme ever charged, is appealing while serving a nine-year prison sentence. (Mr. Devlin-Brown and Mr. Martoma were students at Harvard Law School at the same time).Mr. Devlin-Brown was also on the team of prosecutors that indicted SAC Capital itself. The fund ultimately pleaded guilty and paid more than $1 billion to resolve the case.In the case against JPMorgan, which was accused of failing to thwart Bernard L. Madoffs Ponzi scheme, Mr. Devlin-Brown and his colleagues stopped short of indicting the bank. They did, however, reach a deferred prosecution agreement and extracted a $1.7 billion payment.As chief of the corruption unit, Mr. Devlin-Brown also supervised the offices investigation of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomos interference with and shutdown of the Moreland Commission, an anticorruption panel that he created in July 2013 and abruptly disbanded nine months later in a deal with the legislature. No charges were brought against Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Devlin-Brown also oversaw the prosecution of a still-pending bribery case involving a former United Nations official and other defendants.He has this exceptional level of experience, having done securities cases and corruption cases, said Mr. Breuer, the former Justice Department official, who is now vice chairman of Covington. Hell very quickly become a central figure of the firm."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nations highest-ranking Republican, on Tuesday called Donald J. Trumps remarks about a Latino judge racist, an extraordinary indictment that generated a fresh wave of criticism and panic from other Republicans. By the end of the day, Mr. Trump was forced into a rare moment of damage control and said that his words had been misconstrued.Mr. Trump, who said last week that a Mexican-American judge in a case involving Trump University was biased against him because of his heritage, issued a statement Tuesday saying, I do not feel that ones heritage makes them incapable of being impartial. He added that he was simply questioning whether he was receiving a fair trial, but he did not apologize for his remarks, something many Republicans had urged him to do.Mr. Ryan said Mr. Trumps criticism of the judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel of United States District Court, was the textbook definition of a racist comment. But Mr. Ryan also reiterated his support for Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.I disavow these comments  I regret those comments that he made, Mr. Ryan said. I think that should be absolutely disavowed. Its absolutely unacceptable. But do I believe that Hillary Clinton is the answer? No, I do not.He added: I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than with her.Republicans on Capitol Hill faced an increasingly difficult task  giving Mr. Trump their support while still keeping their distance from his inflammatory language. While many Republicans, like Mr. Ryan, continued to affirm their support for Mr. Trump, others appeared ready to abandon him, throwing the once stolid party further into disarray.I cannot and will not support my partys nominee for president, said Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, becoming the first Republican senator running for re-election to break with Mr. Trump. After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world or to control the nations nuclear arsenal.Mr. Kirk is perhaps the most vulnerable incumbent Republican, in a state where Mr. Trump is likely to be a drag on the ticket. Mr. Kirk, who still speaks with difficulty from a stroke in 2012, also noted that Mr. Trump has mocked a disabled reporter.Others were close to following Mr. Kirk. If Donald remains Donald, I will not vote for him, declared Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who echoed Mr. Ryans denunciation of Mr. Trumps comments.In a victory speech in Westchester County on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump struck a measured tone, saying he understood the responsibility of carrying the mantle of the Republican Party. I will never, ever let you down, he said.But Mr. Trumps more incendiary remarks in other arenas have left many congressional Republicans facing a painful dilemma. Those who are on the ballot defending the partys majorities this year need Mr. Trumps voters to win, and risk angering them with any full disavowal of the nominee. But to continue to embrace him as he openly injects race into the campaign poses its own dangers.Even Republicans who have praised his candidacy warned on Tuesday that the party may have to separate itself from its standard-bearer.Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has met privately with Mr. Trump and been mentioned as a vice-presidential choice, said there could be a line that the presumptive nominee crosses that would make him withdraw his support.This is a crucial two- or three-week period, Mr. Corker said. If at the end of June, moving into a convention and still not having pivoted toward being more of a general election candidate would prove to be very problematic.In private, the senators redirected their anger toward Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is Mr. Trumps most outspoken supporter in the Senate. Senator Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican who is also in a difficult re-election fight, used a closed-door luncheon to complain that Mr. Trumps comments were obscuring the partys economic message and urged Mr. Sessions to tell Mr. Trump to drop his jeremiad against the judge, according to two senators present who requested anonymity to reveal private conversations.Many Republicans hewed to a carefully scripted text in which the prospect of Hillary Clinton in the White House is presented as a larger threat than the risk their party may be taking with Mr. Trump.What we have here is a country in crisis, said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, adding that Mrs. Clinton was not the person to govern in troubled times. But even that defense showed it cracks.Asked which of Mr. Trumps policy statements he preferred over Mrs. Clintons, Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, paused for 11 seconds before saying, I dont know that I want to deal with that.Ms. Ayotte said Mr. Trumps comments were wrong and offensive, adding, He should retract those comments.Among others in a perilous trap are Senators Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose new book boasts of his commitment to civil rights; Tim Scott, the Senates only African-American Republican; and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, sons of Cuban immigrants. Their choice now appears one between their biographies and their principles.Beyond Washington, other Republicans were also not satisfied with Mr. Trumps response. Donald Trump should retract his comments, not defend them. There is no place for racism in the G.O.P., or this country, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said on Twitter.For the moment, Republicans are more focused on limiting the damage they incur as a result of Mr. Trumps candidacy than they are getting him elected.Mr. Scott, who has called Mr. Trumps comments racially toxic, portrayed his own partys nominee as a temporary affliction on conservatism.For the next several months, he will have the loudest voice, but the fact of the matter is there will be other voices speaking as well, he said, not even suggesting Mr. Trump could have the partys loudest voice for four years.On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell deflected numerous questions about Mr. Trump before saying,  Its time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message.Even Republicans who shied from talk of abandoning the nominee shifted their tone. Moving from alarmed to angry, the partys leaders sent Mr. Trump an unmistakable message: He is hurting the party and must stop.Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who has also embraced Mr. Trump, acknowledged that the party may have to disavow Mr. Trump, employing the well-worn maxim from former Justice Potter Stewart about how one can detect pornography.This is one of those things youll know it when you see it, said Mr. Burr, adding, hopefully, that he did not think the party will get there.Dashing into a closed-door luncheon of senators, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, called over her shoulder, His comments are not helping. But Ms. Capito also said in an interview that in her economically depressed state, there is a huge degree of pessimism.People are looking for a message of hope, she added, underscoring the attractiveness of Mr. Trumps economic messages for many Republican voters.Mr. Trump has told his supporters that they should respond by suggesting that reporters who raise questions about his statements are racists, and to carry the message in various forms. One early supporter, Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, gave the technique a whirl in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. You can easily argue that the president of the United States is a racist with his policies and his rhetoric.The conflagration over Mr. Trumps remarks has detracted from Mr. Ryans desperate efforts to change the conversation on the Hill to focus on policy. But most Republicans agreed they had no real recourse at this point. There is no easy answer, Mr. Flake said. You can write someone in.Mr. Trump tried to provide an answer to mitigate the damage. In his statement, he said it was unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent, he added. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard.I do not feel that ones heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial."}
{"text": "ATHENS  Greece on Tuesday signed a major privatization deal that will fulfill a key condition for the release of further bailout funding, but it will also displace thousands of refugees.The deal, for a huge luxury real estate project on the site of the capitals former international airport, was made in a memorandum of understanding between the state privatization agency, Taiped, and a consortium of Greek, Arab and Chinese companies. The land sits on a prime piece of coastline in Elliniko in southern Athens.Elliniko is part of an ambitious privatization program by Greeces leftist-led government and the countrys international creditors. Apart from Greeces power board and other state companies, the portfolio of Greek assets for sale includes former government buildings, beaches and hotels.The deal, which was frozen for a year and a half because of protests, was hailed as a breakthrough. Taipeds chairman, Stergios Pitsiorlas, said the site, which covers four square kilometers, or 1.5 square miles, would accommodate the largest urban regeneration project in Europe, and create thousands of jobs for the debt-ridden nation. The site will also have the largest metropolitan park in Europe, he said. The office of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the investment would help restart the economy.Currently, however, the site is home to some 3,000 refugees who live in a makeshift settlement in the former airport building. The structure also houses several small companies, chiefly shipping and advertising firms. It had served as sports venues for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.The government has promised to clear the site and relocate the refugees to a yet-to-be-determined location by November.The deal was one of the few loose ends needed for creditors to sign off on 7.5 billion euros, about $8.5 billion, in bailout money after the approval of fresh austerity measures in recent weeks.Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greek authorities had done 95 percent of the changes necessary to unlock the money.First signed by the previous conservative-led coalition in November 2014, the privatization deal was held up after protests by local residents and authorities.It was clinched after locals came around to the idea, Mr. Pitsiorlas said in an interview. The developers also agreed to demands by the Greek state for the site to include more green spaces, and to pay maintenance costs. The site will also have malls, golf courses and luxury homes.The consortium of Lamda Development, the Abu Dhabi-based real estate firm Al Maabar and the Chinese conglomerate Fosun International has pledged 915 million euros, about $1 billion, to lease the plot for 99 years. Another 7 billion euros, about $7.9 billion, will go toward the creation of parks, luxury homes, golf courses and the extension of the public transportation and drainage network over 15 years. According to Mr. Pitsiorlas, the project would create more than 40,000 jobs.The new living standard envisioned for Elliniko in a video on Lamda Developments website is a far cry from the current state of the site, described as a mass ghetto by a local mayor, Yiannis Konstantatos.Despite pressure from creditors to sell off state assets, a succession of governments have raised just over 2.5 billion euros from privatizations, including the leasing out of Greek regional airports and the Greek horse race betting organization, compared to an initial target of 50 billion euros."}
{"text": "Aileen Ward, a scholar whose sympathetic, insightful biography of the Romantic poet John Keats won a National Book Award in 1964, died on May 31 in her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 97.The death was confirmed by her nephew Alex Ward.Professor Ward spent nine years researching John Keats: The Making of a Poet, the first major account of his life since the publication of Amy Lowells two-volume Keats in 1925. Her aim was twofold: to critically analyze Keatss poetry and, by reading his inner life, to explain what she called his audacious act of self-creation.In conferring the prize, the administrators of the National Book Award praised the biography as a searching and perceptive reappraisal of a major literary figure, calling it an honest, moving, and beautifully balanced work  a truly distinguished portrait.As is happened, Professor Ward prevailed over a mighty rival, the Harvard literary historian Walter Jackson Bate, who came out with his own Keats biography a few months after Professor Wards, to admiring reviews and, eventually, a Pulitzer Prize. It, too, was in the running for the National Book Award  seemingly a David-and-Goliath contest in terms of the authors reputations  but the readability and psychological acumen of Professor Wards version won the day.The question Bate leaves unexplained is what made the man become the poet, Philip C. Rule wrote in Seeing Into the Life of Things: Essays on Religion and Literature (1997), edited by John L. Mahoney. This is precisely the question that Aileen Ward sets out to answer.Professor Ward was doubly honored when she won the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize in Britain for her biography. She was both the first American and the first woman to win that prize.As Allen Tate was the first to say, Keats is one of the real heroes of literature, she said when receiving the National Book Award. There is hardly another life we know of that speaks so eloquently of the daring, the energy and dedication that are required for great achievement as a writer.Aileen Coursen Ward was born on April 1, 1919, in Newark and grew up in Summit, N.J. Her father, Waldron, was a lawyer; her mother was the former Aline Coursen.After earning a B.A. in English from Smith College in 1940, she enrolled in Radcliffe, where she was awarded an M.A. in 1942 and a doctoral degree in 1953, with a dissertation on poetic metaphor.Professor Ward taught at Wellesley and Barnard before joining the Vassar English department in 1954. She later taught at Sarah Lawrence, Brandeis and New York University. She retired in 1990.While at Wellesley, she struck up a friendship with Vladimir Nabokov, who was teaching Russian there. To cope with wartime gasoline rationing, the college organized car pools for commuters, and she and Nabokov shared a car that took them to their homes in Cambridge.In an interview with Brian Boyd, the author of Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years, Professor Ward recalled that she and Nabokov would pass the time by making up parodies of poems by Thomas Hardy, A. E. Housman and other poets.When Nabokov was trying to find someone to replace him when he left Cornell, shortly after the publication of Lolita, it was she who came up with a successful recommendation, the novelist Herbert Gold.Professor Ward wrote introductions to editions of William Blake and Thomas De Quincey and edited a collection of Keatss poems. She served for many years on the board of Yaddo, the writers retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.She leaves no immediate survivors. Her longtime partner, Nancy Cardozo, died in 2014.At her death, Professor Ward had been at work for a half-century on a biography of Blake. The commitment is like climbing up to the top of a high diving board, she told Booklist in 2003. There is only one way to get down again that you can contemplate."}
{"text": "On the second floor of a classic cast-iron building in SoHo, just above the madding crowd, there is an airy loft, all cool cream tones and Pierre Paulin chairs, oversize art books and Henri Cartier-Bresson prints. And along one wall is a rail of discreet white and black and marinire striped linen and silk, cotton and denim; culottes, shirtdresses, tunics and cashmeres. With price tags attached.Thats because this isnt actually an apartment at all. Its an experiment, and that rail is Stage Three of a long-term plan to do what has never really been done before in American fashion: create a conglomerate of brands all born, if not permanently housed, under one roof.The experiment is being conducted by Adam Pritzker, a positive-thinking spritelike 31-year-old scion of the billionaire Hyatt hotel family, and Vanessa Traina, the famously chic 31-year-old daughter of the romance novelist Danielle Steel and stylist/consultant/BFF of designers like Joseph Altuzarra and Alexander Wang.It started in 2013, when Mr. Pritzker founded Assembled Brands. The next year, they introduced an e-commerce site called the Line with a group of products curated by Ms. Traina, executive creative director. They opened a showroom in New York (the Apartment by the Line) and, after that, one in Los Angeles, with the products posed to look as if in a private house.Peppered among those products was a new brand, Protagonist, an accessible luxury collection marked by its elegant discretion and owned by Assembled Brands, as well as Tenfold, an Assembled Brands homewares collection that recently expanded into T-shirts. Next week, they are introducing their third line, Khaite.Three being fashions magic number: the one that represents critical mass, trend or otherwise.Khaite, designed by Catherine Holstein, late of Gap, is an advanced contemporary collection that looks kind of like a Scandinavian version of Tory Burch, with a quietly sybaritic windswept mood.Like Protagonist, now stocked in 40 other boutiques including Net-a-Porter, it will initially be sold only at the Line, and then wholesale to the wider market.There is talk of starting a mens wear brand and a childrens wear brand, all part of what Ms. Traina calls a distinct vision focused on defining a new kind of American sportswear that is less about trend and more about lifestyle. Also about sourcing the greatest new talent and providing the infrastructure for it to thrive.It all sounds logical enough. Except it has never worked before.One of the perennial breast-beating questions in fashion  along with why drop-crotch pants keep making a comeback even though everyone hates them  is why no conglomerate has arisen to rival the French behemoths Mot Hennessey Louis Vuitton (owner of Vuitton, Givenchy, Cline, Pucci and Fendi, among others) and Kering (Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Stella McCartney, etc.), or the Swiss watch and jewelry giant Richemont (Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin, and so on  and a few clothing names like Chlo and Alaa).Labelux  which was created in 2007 by the Reimann family, the German owners of JAB Holdings (which also owns Coty and a number of coffee brands)  once owned Jimmy Choo, Bally, Belstaff, Zagliani, Solange Azagury-Partridge and Derek Lam. But it has faltered, with the group selling the last two brands back to their founders, putting Zagliani on ice, and renaming the subsidiary JAB Luxury. There are other examples.In Italy, Only the Brave is currently making a stab at it (Maison Margiela, Marni, Viktor & Rolf, Diesel), and Tods owns Hogan, Roger Vivier and Fay (and Tods owner, Diego Della Valle, owns Schiaparelli). But they have nothing like the scale of LVMH and Kering. Which may be why, when LVMH swooped in and bought up Bulgari in 2011 and Loro Piana in 2013, it caused agony and soul-searching in Rome and Milan along the lines of, Why cant we keep our own brands in our own hands?This is also a question that comes up a lot in the United States, where name brands such as Marc Jacobs and Donna Karan are likewise owned by LVMH, and the only group even close to the European model is PVH, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger (and a lot of more mass-market names like Speedo and Izod).Andrew Rosen, who founded Theory and later acquired Helmut Lang, was once credited by Anna Wintour with building an American equivalent of LVMH. But his company is now owned by Fast Retailing, the Japanese-based parent of Uniqlo, and while he has personal investments in Rag & Bone, Proenza Schouler and Alice and Olivia, they are minority stakes.In 2000, to great fanfare, a group called Pegasus announced that it was going to be the American LVMH, and bought Miguel Adrover, Daryl K., Pamela Dennis, Judith Leiber and Angela Amiri, only to close or shed most of those lines by 2001, and rechristen itself the Leiber Group.All of which raises the question: What do Mr. Pritzker and Ms. Traina think they know that all of these other fashion insiders did not?Two reasons most often given for the lack of an American group are absence of available heritage brands on which to build, and timing. When LVMH and Kering, previously PPR, were formed (in 1987 and 1999, Kering at the time being called the Gucci Group, and owned by PPR), most European brands were relatively local, family-run businesses with big names, ripe for the acquisition. Now fashion is a giant global concern, and the financial outlay required to build these kinds of groups is exponentially greater.Which is partly why Assembled Brands is doing none of the above. It is not interested in established brands but rather in making its own, an attitude that nods to the American mythology that mitigates against preservation in favor of creation; that values the idea of invention more than the idea of saving what was.Its back-room synergies are not in capital-intensive areas like real estate, with its fixed costs, but rather in technology, with its related access to consumer data and e-commerce. And its ambitions begin at an entirely different place from the groups that went before.Unlike Franois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, who often talks about buying medium-size companies (with revenue between $50 million and $100 million) and building them up, or LVMH, which spent $2.6 billion on Loro Piana, Mr. Pritzker dreams of expanding via a network of services for brands making around $1 million to $2 million a year in revenue.He aims to use his experience and his own brands, started from scratch and shaped by Ms. Traina, to create an ecosystem with tentacles that provide services (financial, logistic, digital) to a host of independent emerging talent, so that the connected whole adds up to more than the sum of its parts.As a result, one brand doesnt need to be a breakaway success to make the whole thing work, Mr. Pritzker said.Not everyone wants to open 25 stores in five years, he said. On the other hand, he is aiming at growth of 50 percent to 200 percent (we cap it at 200 percent, he said), with 50 percent to 60 percent margins, for his brands.Its a provocative theory: that you can build a big fashion business on the willingness to go small. Whether it works remains to be seen. But in any case, its a new line."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM  The Israeli police briefly detained a leader of a Jewish womens rights group on Tuesday for bringing a Torah scroll to the Western Wall, signaling a resumption of the battle over rituals at the holy site here.Lesley Sachs, the executive director of Women of the Wall, was detained as she exited the Western Wall plaza Tuesday after prayers to mark the start of a new month in the Hebrew calendar. Women of the Wall is a feminist group of Jews that has fought for 27 years for equal prayer rights with the male-dominated religious establishment that has enforced strictly Orthodox and traditional practice at the site.A police spokeswoman said that Ms. Sachs was taken in for questioning after a complaint was lodged against her, and that she was released within a few hours.The rancor over the wall has caused deep discord between the Israeli authorities and Jewish leaders abroad, and tensions are rising again as a government plan approved earlier this year to resolve the issue has stalled.The overwhelming majority of affiliated North American Jews belong to the more liberal, non-Orthodox Reform and Conservative streams and many have said they felt increasingly alienated from Israel. The small Torah scroll that went with Ms. Sachs to the police station was lent to the group by Congregation Bnai Israel, in Sacramento.Women have been detained in the past for wearing prayer shawls traditionally used by men and for singing out loud at the wall, but a Jerusalem court ruled in 2013 that the activists were not disturbing public order and there had been no arrests in recent years.After her detention, Ms. Sachs said: Im very tired. It was a long interrogation. She said she spent about five hours at the police station in the Old City of Jerusalem, where her fingerprints were taken. I am nearly 58 and I never considered myself a criminal, she said, adding, This is not the way it should be in Israel 2016.The Women of the Wall said in a statement that Ms. Sachs was detained despite a relatively quiet and uneventful prayer service with 80 Women of the Wall. The reason given for the police action was smuggling a Torah scroll into the womens section.The Orthodox rabbinical authorities at the Western Wall have continued to bar the women from bringing a Torah scroll in, or from using one of the many scrolls kept in the mens section, and the women have sometimes resorted to subterfuge.But there was nothing too furtive about Tuesdays action. In an email inviting people to join the prayer the group, the activists announced that they would welcome the new month with a Torah scroll.David Barhoum, a lawyer representing Women of the Wall, said that the detention borders on illegality.The battle over the wall was supposed to have been resolved in January when the Israeli government approved the creation of an upgraded egalitarian prayer space at another section of the wall, after years of negotiations. American Jewish leaders hailed the decision at the time as historic and the Women of the Wall saw it as a victory.But the government has so far failed to advance the plan under pressure from the ultra-Orthodox parties in the ruling coalition, who oppose it.Acknowledging difficulties in moving ahead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked for extra time to try to reach a new agreement. When the grace period ended on June 1, American Reform and Conservative leaders and representatives of Women of the Wall met with Mr. Netanyahu and his staff, who asked for a few more weeks to try to resolve the impasse.Rabbi Steven Wernick, the C.E.O. of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, who attended the meeting, said by telephone afterward that Mr. Netanyahu had reiterated his commitment to the plan and was seeking a formula to move forward. Mr. Wernick added that American Jewish leaders understood the challenges posed by Israels coalition politics, but he also expressed what he called their frustration and disappointment over the delay.Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, has warned that a collapse of the agreement could signal a major rift between diaspora Jews and Israel."}
{"text": "As a child, I was pro-carrot in any form. My birthday cake was always raisin-studded carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, and I had no complaints with cooked carrots, especially well-buttered ones.These days, my inclination is toward preparations that mitigate a carrots innate sweetness, which I sometimes find a bit monochromatic (even with prestigious multicolored heirloom carrots). Rather than plain raw or plainly simmered, I crave a carrot with zip. Carrot juice doesnt tempt me at all, generally speaking, but if it did, it would need goosing up with salt, cayenne and acid.So I go for garlicky, lemony carrot salads or vinegar-laced carrot pickles or well-roasted caramelized carrots. I like them sauted with anchovy, capers and parsley or smeared with a kicky red pepper paste. Among the virtues of the carrot is its versatility  the possibilities are limitless.Now that were on the cusp of a new season, since spring produce is fading and most of the summer vegetables are still weeks away, its a good time to appreciate just-harvested new-crop carrots.Long and slender, these carrots obviously taste better, fresher than the fat ones in jumbo bags. (Dont get me started on those so-called baby carrots in the cellophane bags  we all know theyre whittled from giant carrots in some baby carrot factory, impervious to seasoning and appreciated only for their grab-and-go convenience.)I have a friend who makes a lovely, delicate buttery carrot risotto, turned golden with carrot pure and flecked with chives and chervil. These young debutante carrots would be perfect for that.And yet, what I really craved from the carrots in my market basket was carrot soup. Not the cloying, overly sweet, one-dimensional, too-thick, porridge-like generic carrot soup. I wanted a carrot soup with character, with sunny assertive Indian spices (turmeric, coriander, mustard, cumin), a touch of coconut and a squeeze of lime; a soup with the supple consistency of heavy cream but without dairy.We happily had it for dinner, piping hot from the pot. But the next day, when the weather turned warm, it was even better served chilled.Recipe: Spiced Carrot Soup With Lime | More Soups"}
{"text": "DETROIT  At the Movement Festival here, electronic and dance music fans were reminded once again how techno music has its seeds in the cultural dialogue between Detroit and Berlin. And that few individual conversations have been as central to the aesthetic and philosophical evolution of that genre as the one that the American Juan Atkins and the German Moritz von Oswald have been intermittently holding since the late 1980s.The pair of musicians held court on the festivals main stage, then stayed in the late-night mix, performing bass-heavy D.J. sets at afterparties that would not end until the sunrise. At 53, both men are regarded as techno musics spiritual and literal godfathers. Though the two have experienced health issues (both chose not to comment on these), they continue making vital contributions to what is regarded as a youthful practice.The pair used Movement, over the Memorial Day weekend, to mark the live debut in the United States of Transport, the second album they recently released under the name Borderland. Over Skype in April, Mr. von Oswald called the LP an aura event, a high-profile and often meditative reunion between two artists, whose relationship stretches back to before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It also poses a question: In a dance-music bazaar often driven by shiny musical thrills, mass market-oriented festivals and nighttime party economies, is there room for the ruminations of elder statesmen?It is this image of an aging wine, said Dimitri Hegemann, founder of the influential Berlin club and record label Tresor, in a phone interview. He has known Mr. Atkins and Mr. von Oswald since their shared beginning and encouraged the two to record together again. The young wine serves its purpose, but the older wine, when the plants are 80, 90 years old, it is better in a different, more profound way. This quality comes through. Its very peaceful.In a phone interview from his Detroit home a week before Movement, Mr. Atkins said that he met Mr. von Oswald around 1988 or 89, explaining that the German musician came to Detroit along with his colleagues Thomas Fehlmann and Mark Ernestus (Mr. von Oswalds future partner in Basic Channel, the duo whose dub-heavy, minimal techno set a blueprint for the Berlin sound). They went to all the pawn shops to buy up the analog gear  old ARP Odysseys, ARP Axxes, early drum machines, things like that. Eventually, they knocked on the door of a house Mr. Atkins was sharing with Mike Banks, the co-founder of Underground Resistance, a Detroit techno collective central to the ensuing dialogue.Mr. Atkins was already worth seeking out. He had been developing Detroits new electronic sound since 1981: first, with Rik Davis, in the electro duo Cybotron, and after, under pseudonyms such as Model 500 and Channel One for his own label, Metroplex (initiating technos ethos of aliases, of independence from the traditional music industry and of complete creative control).Mr. von Oswald also came with credentials. A classically trained percussionist, he had recently departed Palais Schaumburg, the Hamburg-based avant-garde band that helped start the career of, among others, FM Einheit (later the founder of seminal noise band Einstrzende Neubauten). He had just moved to Berlin to start making electronic music.By 1991, when Mr. Atkins took up an invitation to be a D.J. at Tresor and record with Mr. Fehlmann and Mr. von Oswald (credited to 3MB or Three Men in Berlin), Detroit artists were establishing a beachhead in the city  and deeply influencing its sound and vision. Mr. Atkins said that there was environmental empathy between the newly unified European capital with its vast postwar ruins and the Midwestern metropolis in postindustrial decay: I think the similarities made each of us feel comfortable in the others city.For much of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, the creative exchange between the cities was unrelenting, anchored by steady collaborations between Mr. von Oswald and Mr. Atkins, and others around the Tresor camp. At the same time, the music grew from being an underground phenomenon into what is now a global culture. Sometimes I am really amazed how far my stuff got, Mr. von Oswald said.Yet, while both artists continued experimenting  Forward ever, backward never, Mr. von Oswald said, quoting an old Jacob Miller reggae tune when asked for his creative mantra  the scene around them increasingly codified. Much of it has become a business aimed at the young, with techno tourism around the European Union (especially in Berlin and on the Mediterranean island Ibiza, Spain), Las Vegas and festivals across the world becoming the engines of its economy. Respect for technos originators has remained unabated, but for many, the depth and tonality of their music aged in a way the mass audience did not.Everyone agrees that the recent collaboration  kicked off with a single 2012 session in Berlin that yielded much of Borderlands debut  was Mr. Hegemanns idea.I saw that my job was bringing together two personalities whose work I really admire, but have not worked together in a long time, he said, recalling that he told them: We are now in our 50s, not 22; half of life is behind us. You did all this work, you have this experience, you dont have to write a hit or anything, you can just concentrate on contributing to this old, historical connection between Detroit and Berlin. To his surprise, they both agreed.The duo said that the ease of their working relationship was the mutual regard built over many years: We have a knack for going after and bouncing off each others ideas, Mr. Atkins said.Mr. von Oswald added: If he plays a bass line, I know what to do with the rhythm or the strings. Its not that complicated.Where in retrospect Mr. von Oswald described Borderlands first album as stiff, Transport is more full, more complex. At Mr. Atkins insistence, it was partially recorded at his Detroit studio, to add more of the Detroit flavor, atmosphere into the music, as opposed to just my essence. The resulting track, Riod, is among the albums deeper, dubbier numbers, and the first one completed, setting the stage for an LP that sounds at once classic and thoroughly contemporary  full of propulsion, repetition and, at times, darkly ambient mystery, but nary a drop or a vocal in sight.Mr. Atkins cited a desire for a broader audience only in so much as to offer people alternatives, he said. I dont really think about being relevant.As for aging in what can at times seem like a youthful blood sport both on the dance floor and in the D.J. booth, Mr. von Oswald simply laughs it off: Theres a lot of people who say, Never grow old, but this is no problem for me. I like to grow old. Its enjoyable, I think."}
{"text": "Order in international sports dispute-resolution was preserved Tuesday, as Germanys highest civil court ruled against a speedskater who had challenged the monopolistic authority of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the body that for decades has had the final word on sports disputes around the world.Germanys Federal Court of Justice said Tuesday that Claudia Pechstein, Germanys most decorated Winter Olympian, had received a fair hearing by the arbitration court in 2009, when she challenged a two-year suspension imposed on her by the global governing body for speedskating.Ms. Pechsteins blood had shown abnormal levels of immature red blood cells, a possible indicator of doping; she maintained that her irregular test results stemmed from a congenital blood disorder and not from the use of banned substances.Even after she served the associated two-year suspension, Ms. Pechstein continued to challenge the ruling and, fundamentally, the supreme power of the arbitration court.In order to compete, Olympic federations require athletes like Ms. Pechstein to sign arbitration clauses that bind them to the sports court and waive their rights to bring cases in their home countries.As Ms. Pechsteins case has wended its way through the legal system  with a favorable ruling from a lower court in Germany last January  it has quietly threatened the autonomy of the sports court, which is headquartered in a chateau with traditional green shutters in Lausanne, Switzerland.(The arbitration courts decisions can be overruled by the Swiss Federal Tribunal if there has been a procedural error; following an appeal by Ms. Pechstein, the Swiss court upheld the arbitration courts decision.)In her suit, Ms. Pechstein took issue with the way that athletes were forced into arbitration agreements, claiming the athletes were not guaranteed fair trials because the sports court was not truly independent of sports federations and the International Olympic Committee, which created the court in 1984.The sports courts governing body  which selects the roughly 350 approved arbitrators around the world  includes I.O.C. members, and the court relies on money generated by the Olympics.In its decision, the German federal court said that Ms. Pechstein had entered into the arbitration agreement willingly. Had the German court ruled in favor of Ms. Pechstein, she could have inspired other athletes to pursue similar suits seeking damages for wages lost during suspensions.Thomas Summerer, a lawyer for Ms. Pechstein, said on Tuesday that she planned to move the case to a German constitutional court. He called the idea that she had signed the arbitration agreement voluntarily ridiculous, noting that it was a condition of competition.We are disillusioned that all athletes dispose of equal rights, Mr. Summerer said. It is a black day for all athletes in Europe.FIFPro, the global soccer union, publicly supported Ms. Pechstein in her case. In a statement Tuesday, the organization called for a continued push for a more inclusive, impartial and fair arbitration system for athletes, calling her suit an illustration of structural and procedural deficits of universal concern to athletes.Ian Blackshaw, an international sports law expert, said the Pechstein case was not over, noting it was also pending before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Her consent to arbitration was not a true and free one, Mr. Blackshaw said.The Court of Arbitration trumpeted the decision out of Germany as a validation of its supreme authority.The German courts have no jurisdiction, the sports court said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the decision set a very significant precedent and emphasizes more than ever the need to have the Court of Arbitration for Sport as the worlds highest sports tribunal.In an interview in the Lausanne chateau earlier this year, Matthieu Reeb, secretary general for the arbitration court, said he thought it was unlikely that there would be a significant number of similar suits. I dont think every athlete in the world can afford this kind of marathon, he said, referring to Ms. Pechsteins seven-year legal battle. We have already changed all kinds of things between 2009 and today.Mr. Reeb said that the court had enacted a new legal-aid system, providing pro bono representation should an athlete require it, and that it had sought to diversify its governing body, with stronger representation from outside the sports world, focused on recruiting legal and arbitration experts.That ruling body has not, however, dissolved its Olympic ties. Just last week, Tricia Smith, a member of the sports courts governing body, was named an I.O.C. member, joining at least five others with links to both the I.O.C. and the sports court."}
{"text": "You hate to give in to national stereotypes, but a pair of recent engrossing European thrillers fulfill certain expectations about their home countries.The Bureau, a French spy series whose 10-episode first season became available on iTunes on Tuesday (the first episode is free), is moody, cynical and stylish, with the pace and disjunctive tics of an art-house film.Occupied, a Norwegian political drama whose 10-episode first season began unspooling on the Pivot cable channel last month (and which has been streaming on Netflix since January), is a straightforward noirish thriller with a spare aesthetic that can occasionally feel a little threadbare (even though its reportedly the most expensive series in the history of Norwegian television).Based on an idea by the mystery novelist and Nordic noir stalwart Jo Nesbo, Occupied is a high-concept, high-stakes story. A new prime minister with an environmentalist agenda announces that Norway will shut down its oil and gas industry in the face of global warming. The rest of Europe, afraid of the economic effects, forces him to accept a peaceful Russian occupation of his country thats initially disguised as temporary assistance with oil production.The series plays out as a thought experiment  what will the Norwegians do as they gradually come to terms with their loss of sovereignty? While Berg (Henrik Mestad), the idealistic but pragmatic prime minister, tries to keep the situation from spiraling into outright war, we see the action through the eyes of various smaller players, including one of Bergs bodyguards (Eldar Skar) and a left-wing journalist (Vegar Hoel). In wry Scandinavian fashion, both of those men have trouble convincing their wives that world-shaking events are taking place, and are ordered to pick up children and wash dishes as scheduled.Occupied goes for big dramatic strokes  assassinations, gun battles on oil platforms, escapes into the safety of the United States Embassy (where the Americans arent very helpful). Not all of its ideas pay off, but enough do to make it at least mildly addictive.The Bureau, while a quieter and subtler show, is no less intense. It recalls the paranoid American film thrillers of the 70s (Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View) but the obvious referent is Homeland  its that shows world-weary Gallic analogue.The film star Mathieu Kassovitz (Amelie) plays Malotru, a French spy whos brought in from the cold after serving six years undercover in Damascus. We see his adjustment to life in the office, handling agents the way he used to be handled, and to life back in Paris, where hes reunited with his understandably wary daughter. When he explains the nature of undercover work to her  befriending people, gathering information  she replies, Thats why you left for six years, to make acquaintances. She would almost prefer that he had been killing people, which would better fit her image of a spy.The Bureau builds its tension, revolving around a key agent who goes missing in Algeria, more slowly and elliptically than many American shows. And theres a certain amount of self-consciously arty cinematography and editing. But those are small quibbles with a series this consistently smart and understated. While training a new operative, Malotru tells her: You dont recruit. You describe. The same restrained approach works well for the show."}
{"text": "Under fire for suggesting that a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, was biased because he is Mexican-American, Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday that the judges heritage does not make him  incapable of being impartial. Heres the statement his campaign released:It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that ones heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report.Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five-year period, more than 10,000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump Universitys programs. For example:Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump Universitys three-day seminar excellent in every category, but also praised Trump Universitys mentorship program in a glowing five-plus minute video testimonial. When asked how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals, she simply stated [c]ontinue to offer great classes. Once the plaintiffs lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs motion, but allowed the case to continue.Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump Universitys three-day seminar excellent in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would attend another Trump University seminar and even recommend Trump University seminars to a friend. When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohens only suggestion was to [h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in and make the lunch break 45 minutes. Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative advertisements from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump Universitys programs excellent in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided more comfortable chairs.Indeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www.98percentapproval.com.For those students who decided that Trump Universitys programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within three days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multiday program, whichever came later.Normally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial.I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies  like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier  are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage.Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the judges reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama-appointed judges impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case.While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!Donald J. Trump"}
{"text": "BEIJING  Secretary of State John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart laid out diverging positions regarding the South China Sea on Tuesday, indicating that annual talks between the United States and China had done little to bridge the differences over what has become one of the most volatile issues in their relationship.In Beijing, a senior American official also revealed that President Obama had warned President Xi Jinping of China during a meeting in March about the maritime friction and about Washingtons obligations to a regional ally, the Philippines.On Tuesday, at the end of what is called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Mr. Kerry praised the talks as an essential mechanism to air differences and nurture cooperation.But comments both by Mr. Kerry and by State Councilor Yang Jiechi of China suggested that their governments remained far apart on the continuing disputes in the South China Sea. China has laid claim to many islands and outcrops across the sea that are also claimed by Southeast Asian countries, notably the Philippines and Vietnam.I reiterated Americas fundamental support for negotiations, and a peaceful resolution based on the rule of law, as well as, obviously, our concern about any unilateral steps by anyone, whichever country, to alter the status quo, Mr. Kerry said during a joint appearance with Chinese officials in the Great Hall of the People in the heart of Beijing.After Mr. Kerry spoke, Mr. Yang, who steers Chinese foreign policy and is senior to the foreign minister, said China remained adamantly opposed to an arbitration case brought by the Philippines to assert its claims in the sea.A court in The Hague is expected to deliver its decision in the case soon, but Beijing has said it will not accept the result.This has not changed and will not change, Mr. Yang said of Chinas opposition to the case. He repeated Chinas position that it is willing to negotiate over the disputes, but only with each individual country holding a rival claim, rather than collectively.The islands of the South China Sea have been Chinese territory since antiquity, Mr. Yang said. China has every right to uphold its territorial rights and legitimate maritime rights and interests.The Obama administration has urged China to negotiate with Southeast Asian nations collectively to solve the disputes, and it has warned Beijing against its energetic development of reefs and outcrops into artificial islands with military facilities.The United States  recently sent military ships and planes near some of those islands, to make the point that it would insist on freedom of navigation in the area, and Beijing bristled at the gesture.This Strategic and Economic Dialogue was the last for the Obama administration, and there is uncertainty about how much importance the next president might give to the annual talks. But Chinese and American officials said there was value in discussing contentious issues face to face, even if no solution was in sight.The South China Sea issue came up early in the meetings, when the United States warned China against any action in the waterway involving American treaty obligations to the Philippines, a senior State Department official said.The warning was a reiteration of what Mr. Obama told Mr. Xi during their meeting in Washington in March, the official said.The official spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with diplomatic custom. On Sunday, before the formal start of the talks, Chinese and American officials, including some uniformed military officers from both sides, talked about security matters. Zhang Yesui, Chinas executive vice foreign minister, and Antony J. Blinken, the deputy secretary of state, led the delegations.The Philippines has long claimed Scarborough Shoal, an outcrop off its western coast that was once used as a firing range by the United States military. In 2012, China took over the shoal by expelling Philippine fishermen and deploying a patrol of coast guard vessels to prevent the fishermens returning.Scarborough Shoal is the largest outcrop in the dispute between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea. The United States, which now has access to five military bases in the Philippines, recently flew a Navy plane over the shoal in a demonstration to China of American concerns. The United States and the Philippines also recently conducted joint patrols in the waterway.Since China began building artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago near the Scarborough Shoal, former military officials have hinted that Beijing would start to build the shoal into a more permanent platform able to accommodate military installations.The security session on Sunday also included discussion of an episode last month involving two Chinese fighter jets that flew dangerously close to an EP-3 American spy plane in international airspace off the coast of Hainan, the southernmost province of China, the senior State Department official said.The Chinese aircraft came as close as 50 feet to the American plane, the Pentagon said at the time. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing denied that the Chinese had flown too close and described the encounter as normal.It was unclear whether Chinas senior military leaders had ordered the two jets to get close to the American plane or whether the pilots were acting independently and trying to show off their flight skills.Also discussed at the meeting were human rights and the status of foreign nongovernmental organizations in China. The Obama administration has sharply criticized a new Chinese law aimed at controlling and limiting the work of such groups on issues including rights for migrant workers, climate change and the rule of law. The American Chamber of Commerce in China has expressed disappointment with the law, saying that it would harm the companies it works with.The law, scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, requires foreign groups to register with the police, who will be empowered to examine all aspects of their operations. It also mandates that the groups find official Chinese partners.Earlier in the day, Mr. Yang, the state councilor, said the organizations activities would not be obstructed if the groups observed Chinas laws.At a news conference at his hotel after meeting with Mr. Xi, Mr. Kerry said that he was reassured by the Chinese presidents explanations of the law.The United States forcefully presented its objections to the law, he said, adding, We have to show some patience.What I heard directly from President Xi, actually, was that China intends to remain open, stay open, to open up even more than it is today, Mr. Kerry said, and that it does not see these laws are going to be applied in any way whatsoever that affects their ability to open up and to do business.He said he found it not insignificant that the president of the country spoke directly about the problem. Now the question is, is that in fact what happens?"}
{"text": "AMSTERDAM  What if the solutions to Europes most pressing problems lie not in politics or diplomacy, but in art and culture?With the European Union under pressure from economic stagnation, a wave of refugees, terror attacks and the possibility of Britain leaving the bloc, more than 150 cultural figures from 37 countries  including the actor Jude Law and the architect Rem Koolhaas  gathered here at a forum last week to explore that possibility.The debate about the future of Europe can only prosper with the imagination of artists and thinkers, Yoeri Albrecht, the director of De Balie, an Amsterdam cultural center, and a curator of the forum Re: Creating Europe, said at the opening session June 1.Until now, Mr. Albrecht said, that debate has become the sole property of economists and public servants, and the discussion almost always circles around money and bureaucracy. But Europe is essentially about hope and forgiveness, and these two ideas are ideas built and made by culture.The forum was sponsored by several Dutch and European foundations and the city of Amsterdam and included lectures, interviews, performances and expert sessions at various locations throughout the city.The three-day event opened with a performance created by the Belgian director and playwright Ivo van Hove. A multilingual cast, including Mr. Law, quoted passages from politicians, philosophers and authors who had considered the case for a unified Europe, pro and con.Mr. Law gave a dramatic reading from the landmark 1946 speech by Winston Churchill that called for a kind of United States of Europe  where small nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honor by a contribution to the common cause. He also read from a recent speech by the former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, which criticized the euro and supported a British withdrawal from the European Union.Other actors quoted Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, arguing for a return to French sovereignty, as well as Jean Monnet, a founding father of the European Union, who postulated a common interest beyond differences and geographical boundaries.Seventy years ago, Europe appeared as the kind of salvation to hundreds of years of nationalist wars, conflict and holocaust, the American author and political theorist Benjamin R. Barber said after the opening session. As hope unravels around the refugee crisis, around Brexit, around terrorism, people ask then is Europe unraveling? Is the idea unraveling? Was Europe the great salvation that has now failed?The idea is, he added, if we find Europe again, maybe we could find our way out of all of these things.He warned against focusing too much on creating Europe as a single, united entity to the exclusion of people from elsewhere.Its wonderful to see the Europeans struggling to rediscover Monnets dream of a unified Europe, he said. But at the same time a bit depressing to see how parochial Europe is. In some ways, Europe has become to the rest of the world what Germany once was to Europeans: an aggressive colonizing force with walls around it that talks about itself and ignores everyone else.Mr. Koolhaas; Luuk van Middelaar, a political theorist; and Mr. Albrecht led a 12-hour interview session that sought to answer the question, What is Europe?Stella Ghervas, a Swiss historian, said that question had occupied thinkers for centuries.Everyone was trying to answer this question about how to have perpetual peace and how to solve this chronic disease of Europe, which was incessant war, Ms. Ghervas said. Its a political definition of Europe that begins at the turn of the 18th century, a real need to propose alternatives to the conflicts of continental Europe.Mr. Barber gave the keynote address in an evening session at the Royal Concertgebouw concert hall, featuring a performance by the Dutch singer Wende. He proposed an international parliament of cities, in which mayors could share ideas for solving problems, rather than relying on nation-states, which he considers outdated because their governments are concerned with issues of borders and sovereignty that inhibit their ability to work together.During the forum speakers grappled with the notion of finding a shared European cultural identity within a pluralistic society. Many were concerned that Europe was being defined only in response to world events, or in opposition to outside forces, rather than finding its own sense of ethics and direction.In a session for policy makers at Castrum Peregrini, a cultural center that served as a secret hiding place for Jewish artists and intellectuals during World War II, Dublins city arts officer, Ray Yeates, referring to the economic crisis and the resulting breakdown of trust among European nations, said, Were all in a period of post-traumatic stress, where the fundamental part of us as citizens was struck at its core.We have to think in a cultural way about what values could liberate us, Mr. Yeates said. We need a new myth, a new thing that defines us.A final statement was presented through artworks and performances at the Stedelijk Museum last Friday to Jet Bussemaker, the Dutch culture minister and a top cultural official at the Council of Europe.In her closing remarks, Ms. Bussemaker said, Ready-made solutions wont help us tackle the problems that Europe faces.When todays artists connect the worlds of imagination, expertise and technology, she added, they give us wings to lift Europe to a higher plane and raise our thinking to a higher level."}

{"text": "Revolutions rarely give way to gracious expressions of defeat.And so, despite the crushing California results that rolled in for him on Tuesday night, despite the insurmountable delegate math and the growing pleas that he end his quest for the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the stage in Santa Monica and basked, bragged and vowed to fight on.In a speech of striking stubbornness, he ignored the history-making achievement of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who became the first woman in American history to clinch the presidential nomination of a major political party.Mr. Sanders waited until 15 minutes into his speech to utter Mrs. Clintons name. He referred, almost in passing, to a telephone conversation in which he had congratulated her on her victories. At that, the crowd of more than 3,000 inside an aging airport hangar booed loudly. Mr. Sanders did little to discourage them.Tuesday was, undeniably, Mrs. Clintons night, a milestone for women in politics and civic life 95 years after the 19th Amendment guaranteed their right to vote.But by Wednesday morning, all eyes were on Mr. Sanders. Would he be generous or petulant? Would he let go or keep battling?At almost every turn, he was grudging toward Mrs. Clinton, passing up a chance to issue the kind of lengthy salute that many, in and out of the Democratic Party, had expected and craved.Its a blown opportunity to build bridges that are going to be extremely important in the fall, said David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents, both Democratic and Republican. He worried that Mr. Sanders was becoming a grumpy old man.The raw math is brutal and indisputable: Mrs. Clinton has not just crossed the threshold of 2,383 delegates needed to secure the nomination. As of Tuesday night, she had succeeded in winning a majority of pledged delegates, a majority of the states that have held primaries, and the popular vote.This would be the time, under normal circumstances, for a primary rival to acknowledge insurmountable odds, pay tribute to a prevailing opponent and begin the work of stitching together a divided political party.That was the conciliatory message that a vanquished Mrs. Clinton delivered eight years ago to the day, on June 7, 2008, four days after Barack Obama had sealed his partys nomination  a contest that was mathematically closer than the one with Mr. Sanders now.We all know this has been a tough fight, Mrs. Clinton said at the time. But the Democratic Party is a family. And now, its time to restore the ties that bind us together.On Tuesday, she was effusive in her praise of Mr. Sanders and in her outreach to his supporters, mentioning him by name three times in her victory address in Brooklyn.Let there be no mistake, she said. Senator Sanders, his campaign, and the vigorous debate that weve had about how to raise incomes, reduce inequality, increase upward mobility have been very good for the Democratic Party and for America.But Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a revolutionary, is openly skeptical of the traditions and expectations that govern the party whose nomination he covets. Throughout his campaign, he has regarded the Democratic Party itself with suspicion and distrust.Party unity, it seems, is the farthest thing from his mind at the moment.Far from backing down, Mr. Sanders promised to take his campaign to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summer, raising the possibility that he could remain in the race, without ever conceding defeat, until July.We will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get, Mr. Sanders thundered.Declaring that the movement he has begun is more than Bernie, Mr. Sanders sounded at times messianic.Our vision, he said, will be the future of America.Inside the airport hangar in Santa Monica, anger at Mrs. Clinton, and at the establishment she exemplifies, was visceral and abundant, overshadowing her electoral advantage and barrier-breaking night.Freddie Paull, a 26-year-old filmmaker from Glendale, Calif., was not interested in milestones. He said he thought Mrs. Clinton was a crook. She could be indicted literally tomorrow if the system is not corrupt, he said.I would love to see a woman in office, he added. But I do not want to see Hillary Clinton in office, because she has no honor.Should Mr. Sanders drop out, he said, he was prepared to vote for Mr. Trump.Amid chants of Bernie or Bust and loud boos as election results rolled in, Alison Bacon, an actress living in Los Angeles, assailed Mrs. Clinton for having proclaimed victory before the Democratic Party had formally bestowed it on her at the convention.I think its absolutely unjust, undemocratic, un-American, she said. What kind of example is that setting?Of course, ending a campaign is always painful, especially one that so consistently defied expectations and openly challenged the political order.From its humble start in April 2015 outside the Capitol in Washington, in a sparsely attended and hurried announcement speech (We dont have an endless amount of time, he warned the gathered reporters, I have to get back), Mr. Sanders built a rollicking national movement whose crowds, fund-raising and devotion upended the Democratic race.And Mr. Sanders was not merely a candidate to his supporters. With his Everyman appearance and unvarnished anger, he embodied the message that thrilled his followers: that it was time for working Americans to rise up and reclaim a country that was being corrupted by elites and their wealth.When we began this campaign a little over a year ago, we were considered to be a fringe campaign, Mr. Sanders said on Tuesday, adding wryly: I think that has changed, just a little bit.But even as he acknowledged a very, very steep fight to winning his partys nomination, he did not signal an end for now  still electrified, it seemed, by the crowds chanting his name.Howard Dean, a Democrat and a former governor of Vermont, can sympathize. Its very hard to concede, he said. You are tired. You are cranky. Youve worked your butt off for two years.Nobody, Mr. Dean said, resisted ending a presidential campaign more than he did. Once a high-flying front-runner, he had a string of setbacks that left him feeling, by February 2004, much as Mr. Sanders does today: furious at an unfair system and determined to fight on.Then Al Gore called. Mr. Dean fulminated, uninterrupted, for 10 minutes, ranting and raving, he recalled. But Mr. Gore, schooled in the art of painful concessions, was blunt. You know, Howard, he said, This is not really about you. This is about the country.Mr. Dean, taking the advice to heart, quit the campaign a few days later. The minute he said it, Mr. Dean recalled, I looked like an idiot to myself.He said he wonders whether Mr. Sanders will heed the warning. Bernie has changed politics, but his changes are not going to be realized unless he leads  and leading is not going to mean tilting at windmills at the convention, Mr. Dean said. He has to switch into the mode of a statesman.You dont get any points for carrying on or complaining about it, Mr. Dean added. You get points for sucking it up."}
{"text": "ORLANDO, Fla.  It will undoubtedly take more than a convincing win over Haiti to reinvigorate Brazils love affair with its national soccer team.With only 35 minutes on the stadium clock, Brazil, five-time world champions, already had three goals against an earnest collection of Haitian players who were content enough to be joining the party at this summers Copa Amrica Centenario without registering a seismic result against a team that has traditionally been one of the games powers.The Brazilian team, known as the Seleo, would go on to score seven times, satisfying the healthy-sized crowd, announced at 28,241, with the tournaments highest-scoring game so far. Philippe Coutinho, the Liverpool forward, was impressive, scoring three of Brazils goals.We are humble, but a result like this gives us confidence, said Brazil defender Filipe Lus. Coutinho is a great player, who showed it on the pitch.But for Dunga, Brazils coach, problems remain.No matter what story the scoreboard told, there is an acute lack of interest among Brazils fans in the Seleos progress this summer. With the Rio Olympics looming, fans seemed to shrug at Brazils draw in the opening match of the tournament, in which an unlucky Ecuadorean team was denied a victory by some questionable officiating.Confidence among Dungas players has been understandably low. And a meeting with Haiti, ranked 71st, would probably only marginally reinvigorate a team under the pressure it faces.Brazils mystique remains in the hearts of those who recall their glory days. Such was the magic from legendary players such as Pel, Jairzinho, Zico, Ronaldo and Romrio, that it was impossible not to be enthralled.The current Brazilian squad, however  which effectively played its B team, having rested Neymar for the Olympics  will need to dispatch better teams than Haiti before it can entertain dreams of returning to soccers summit.Brazil was last crowned World Cup champion in 2002, and triumphed in the Copa Amrica five years later. Since then, there has been little to excite a nation whose lifeblood is the most popular sport on the planet.Indeed, the embarrassment of losing by 7-1 to Germany on home soil in the 2014 World Cup semifinals was the nadir for those who had grown sick and tired of the C.B.F., Brazilian soccers governing body, which had become embroiled in corruption and a crackdown on irregular activity within FIFA.Football was our drug, but now we are sober and having to face a dark reality, said Leonardo Licinio, a soccer fan in Brazil. Corruption, economic crisis, unemployment. The phantom of that 7-1 haunts us.As Dunga lamented his teams ability to prepare since arriving in the United States  the team was unable to practice at Camping World Stadium on Tuesday because of heavy rainfall  he spoke that day like a man who was feeling intense heat. The tide, it was clear, could not be turned on this result.What mattered most, it seemed, was that the manner of play had to pay homage to Brazilian legend.The team would have to move the ball with panache and vigor. It would have to attack or excite.The Haitians, whose soccer-crazed population has always fawned over Brazil and its South American rival Argentina, injected a sense of excitement into this match, even if they saw little of the ball in the opening stages. Casemiro, the Real Madrid midfielder, almost opened the scoring for Brazil seven minutes into the game when a long-range effort was deflected wide of goalkeeper Johnny Placides net.Yet Coutinhos excellent run and finish at 14 minutes left Placide with no chance of averting danger. It was an excellent goal and one that invigorated Dungas team. Coutinhos second goal, at 29 minutes, was far more straightforward  he rolled the ball in from close range after Jonas had teed him up  though equally important.Renato Augustos header 10 minutes before the end of the first half ensured that the rest of the match resembled target practice for Brazil. Gabriel Barbosa, who was introduced as a second-half substitute, pushed the score to 4-0 at 59 minutes before Lucas Lima headed in a fifth goal soon after. Augusto made it six late in the game before Coutinhos curling effort brought the crowd to its feet at the end.Take nothing away from Brazil, said Haitis Jean Marc Alexandre. Their fifth team would beat most teams in the world. We made too many mistakes.Haiti was ultimately outclassed but worked hard, though the result was never in doubt. Haitis consolation goal by James Marcelin at 69 minutes received the loudest cheer of the evening, speaking volumes about his teams effort.Only when better opposition comes into view for Brazil, however, can the current state of Brazilian soccer be properly assessed. The test starts with Peru on Sunday in Brazils final group game."}
{"text": "Starting with my first trip to Afghanistan in 2012, I have met many Afghans who are struggling with the unremitting question of whether to leave or stay in their country. For them, the debate goes beyond wanting to improve their lives  it is about survival. Their decision can waver as they experience both the moments of normalcy that encourage them to stay, and an increase of random explosions and attacks that push them to leave. Making this decision has become only more urgent as conditions have deteriorated in the last year.On one hand, it is difficult to leave behind a familiar place that is so much a part of your identity to start over in a foreign place that offers little to no opportunity. Many Afghans also feel a strong sense of responsibility to try to continue the progress their nation has made in the last 15 years. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, a wave of Afghans returned to the country to rebuild. Unfortunately, leaving has become a necessity rather than a choice for many because of rising violence, rampant corruption and the Talibans increasing foothold.Watching the migration crisis unfold, I so often see refugees portrayed as the other trying to get in. The news media often relies on statistics to depict the crisis, dehumanizing the people behind the numbers. Because of a common narrative that Afghans are moving for economic reasons, countries have closed their borders to these refugees specifically. This film is an attempt to bring empathy and nuance to the complexities of this innately human choice.Alexandria BombachFour months after this film was made, the subjects provided updates on their lives.After receiving a special immigrant visa for his work with the American government in Kabul, Mr. Seddique moved to the United States in January. He first stayed with families through a resettlement program in Sacramento, but lately he has been traveling the country searching for a job. Now I am not scared as much as I was about how will I be received and accepted in the U.S., he wrote. Before I arrived all I heard in the media was about violence, discrimination and right-wing immigrant-hating extremists, but so far that hasnt been true in my case and I hope I can say the same thing 20 years from now.Dr. Qaderi left Kabul with her children after this film was made. (Her husband remained in Kabul to help support the family.) After flying to Turkey, they made the harrowing journey to Greece by boat. Now they are staying in Athens in a rented house, but life is bleak. The children are not in school and though Rana knows she is fortunate compared to other migrants she feels depressed and adrift. Even looking at the flowers across the way on the neighbors porch is difficult; I cannot find the sight pleasant anymore because of the stress and pressure from the uncertainty of our situation, and I know this is a dangerous mental state to be in, she wrote. Yesterday my daughter saw another migrant man who was collecting rotten apples from the trash in the market place to feed his children. Before starting this trip I had the perception that human lives matter to the Europeans and people who live in first-world countries, but here I learned that only their own lives matter to them and no other human lives have any value to them.Here is a poem she wrote about her experience:Ms. Saboori, far left, remains in Kabul, where she continues to make films and to pursue her passion for swimming. My preference is still living in this geography of terror and war over living in the developed countries of America and Europe, she wrote. That is because here I am recognized as a first-class citizen; I have identity of my own. I may be lacking so many things here but I am not confused and wondering all the time, I am free here and can do whatever I want to.Despite an increasing number of friends emigrating from Afghanistan, Mr. Sharifi still remains with his wife in Kabul, where he runs ArtLords, a grassroots art for social change movement. He feels conflicted about his decision. He reflected: Having felt the suffering of the people of my country that has gone through five decades of war, violence and poverty, I have always felt indebted to make a difference in the lives of my people.

{"text": "Its not easy to get to the right of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. when it comes to the rights of criminal defendants. In fact, for a long time I thought it was impossible. The late Justice Antonin Scalias robust view of aspects of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments led him to vote to overturn criminal sentences with some regularity. Justice Clarence Thomas, who views civil forfeiture as imposing an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment, has occasionally done so as well. Justice Alito: a millimeter this side of never.And then, two weeks ago, came the courts long-anticipated ruling in Foster v. Chatman. In an opinion by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the Supreme Court overturned a 30-year-old murder conviction, ruling that racial discrimination infected the selection of the all-white Georgia jury that found a black man guilty of a white womans murder. The vote was 7 to 1. The dissenter was Justice Thomas. His vote, along with the contorted 15-page opinion that explained it, was one of the most bizarre performances I have witnessed in decades spent observing the Supreme Court. As the post-Scalia Roberts court continues to take shape  and in advance of the final onslaught of decisions to come in the next few weeks  its worth pausing to consider this vote and the role of the justice who cast it.I should make clear what Im not saying. Im not suggesting that because Justice Thomas is the courts only black member, he has some kind of heightened obligation to take up the cause of black defendants, or black anyone else. Approaching his 25th anniversary on the court, he has made his rejection of such a role corrosively clear. After all, this is a man who, speaking from deeply felt personal experience, has called affirmative action a cruel farce. And three years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder, he not only joined the 5-to-4 majority in eviscerating the Voting Rights Act, but wrote in a separate opinion that he thought the court should have sliced even deeper into the statute. I almost think Justice Thomas revels in his chosen role as the anti-Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights hero whose seat he took on Oct. 23, 1991.Granting all that, Foster v. Chatman was not just any criminal case. Yes, of course it was importantly about race. But it was also about something just as deep, or even deeper: the Supreme Courts commitment to its own principles. This case posed the question: does the court mean what it says?Thirty years ago, in Batson v. Kentucky, the court established a framework for smoking out and preventing racial discrimination in jury selection. The decision took aim at peremptory challenges, the ability of each side to remove potential jurors without giving a reason. It was standard operating procedure for prosecutors to use peremptory challenges to prevent African-Americans from serving as jurors in trials of black defendants. The Batson decision held that when the defense made a plausible claim that a peremptory challenge was racially motivated, the prosecution had to offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question. The trial judge was then to decide whether the prosecutions explanation held up or whether it was a pretext.The problem was that the Batson decision didnt work. It turned out that judges often settled for explanations that were feeble or worse; the unappealing alternative, from an elected judges point of view, was calling the local prosecutor a liar. Reliable studies showed that decades after Batson had been hailed as a breakthrough in racial justice, it was making little difference.Then Foster v. Chatman arrived at the Supreme Courts door. This case, brought by Stephen B. Bright, president and senior counsel of the Southern Center for Human Rights and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School, presented what was lacking in nearly all other Batson follow-up cases: a smoking gun. Long-concealed notes, obtained by the defense under the Georgia Open Records Act, showed that the prosecutors in Timothy Fosters trial had identified all five black potential jurors as definite nos and proceeded to use peremptory challenges to strike four of them. (The fifth was dismissed after notifying the judge of a personal connection to the defendant.)When the defense invoked the then recently decided Batson decision to object to the peremptory strikes, the judge accepted prosecution explanations that were laughable on their face. For example, the prosecutor said he struck 34-year-old Marilyn Garrett because the state was looking for older jurors that would not easily identify with the defendant, who was 19. Yet there were eight white jurors under the age of 36 whom the prosecution didnt strike; one who ended up serving was 21. The prosecutor also said he struck Ms. Garrett because she was divorced, while not striking three white potential jurors who were divorced.Despite this and similar evidence, the Georgia state courts refused to reopen the case. The Supreme Court accepted the appeal last May and heard argument in November. In his opinion, Chief Justice Roberts focused on the striking of Ms. Garrett and that of one other potential juror, Eddie Hood. In explaining that strike, the prosecutor had told the trial judge that Mr. Hoods son had been convicted of a crime, basically the same thing that this defendant is charged with.Nonsense, Chief Justice Roberts declared in recounting this exchange. He added: Hoods son had received a 12-month suspended sentence for stealing hubcaps from a car in a mall parking lot five years earlier. Foster was charged with capital murder of a 79-year-old widow after a brutal sexual assault. The explanation, the chief justice said, can only be regarded as pretextual.He summarized: The focus on race in the prosecutions file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury. The opinion concluded: Two peremptory strikes on the basis of race are two more than the Constitution allows.Chief Justice Roberts was in the majority in all 10 cases that were argued during the courts November sitting, meaning that he had the prerogative to assign himself the majority opinion in any of those cases. He chose Foster v. Chatman  a statement, I believe, that this case was not only doctrinally but institutionally important.Even Justice Alito had to agree, albeit somewhat grudgingly, in a separate opinion that complained about the courts assertion of jurisdiction this late in the day over a procedurally convoluted appeal from a state courts final judgment. Yet he felt constrained to agree with the court that the totality of the evidence now adduced by Foster is sufficient to make out a Batson violation. He added, Compliance with Batson is essential to ensure that defendants receive a fair trial and to preserve the public confidence upon which our system of criminal justice depends.And then there was the Thomas dissent. The majority opinion distorts the deferential Batson inquiry, he wrote. It invites state prisoners to go searching for new evidence by demanding the files of the prosecutors who long ago convicted them. He added: New evidence should not justify the relitigation of Batson claims.The problem, Justice Thomas said, was not only that the evidence was obtained long after the fact, but that it didnt prove what the majority claimed it proved. Perhaps the Courts decision to reconsider a decades-old Batson claim based on newly discovered evidence would be less alarming if the new evidence revealed that the trial court had misjudged the prosecutors reasons for striking Garrett and Hood, he said. It does not.Justice Thomass opinion combed through pieces of the record that the chief justices opinion hadnt mentioned, and concluded: It was the trial court that observed the veniremen [the potential jurors] firsthand and heard them answer the prosecutions questions, and its evaluation of the prosecutions credibility on this point is certainly far better than this courts nearly 30 years later.When the Batson case was decided, Justice Marshall filed a concurring opinion that hailed the historic step in ending racial discrimination in criminal trials but warned that it would prove unavailing. Only by banning peremptories entirely can such discrimination be ended, he wrote. His was, at the time, a solitary voice. Justice Stephen G. Breyer later came to the same conclusion, but didnt write separately in Foster v. Chatman, not wanting, I suspect, to undercut the force of the chief justices fact-based conclusion.Now we have another solitary voice. How strange. How sad."}
{"text": "Hillary Clinton claimed the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday and appealed to the country to reject Donald J. Trump, as a candidate unfit for the presidency.Mrs. Clinton finished strong in her longer-than-expected primary battle with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, capturing California, according to The Associated Press, and three other states. Mr. Trump did not wait for her to declare victory, lacing into Mrs. Clinton from a golf course he owns in Westchester, and promising to give a speech thoroughly assailing her next week.But even as the Clinton-Trump battle lines were coming into focus, Mr. Sanders announced from California that he was not prepared to stand down, a potentially irksome development for Mrs. Clinton.Some of the biggest things we learned on Tuesday:The final Democratic primaries shaped up much like the first round in February: as a contest between Mrs. Clintons coalition of women, older voters and nonwhites, and Mr. Sanderss base of whites, rural voters and young people. That broad matchup budged only a little over the course of the race, handing Mrs. Clinton victory in all the biggest, most populous, diverse and delegate-rich states.Mrs. Clintons firm base of support repelled Mr. Sanders repeatedly, in states like Illinois, New York and Ohio, and again in California and New Jersey on Tuesday night.Mrs. Clinton will also rely on this coalition in the general election, and she indicated as much with a victory speech stressing the long fight for womens equality in politics, and themes of inclusion and racial tolerance.Mr. Sanders staked his fading campaign on California and trailed Mrs. Clinton there by a significant margin with more than 90 percent of the votes counted. Yet in his election night remarks, Mr. Sanders declared he would forge ahead in the Washington, D.C., primary next week, and would fight on to the convention in Philadelphia in July. While he noted that Mrs. Clinton won several states on Tuesday, he acknowledged neither the delegate barrier she had crossed nor the historic nature of her victory.Mr. Sanders demonstrated on Tuesday night why Mrs. Clinton may want him as an ally in the fall campaign. He showed on Tuesday that he is capable of attacking Mr. Trump in stinging language, saying that the Trump campaigns major theme is bigotry. But for now, Mr. Sanders appears determined to defy his adopted party and extend his run in a race that is already resolved.I know that the fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight, he said, but we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate.When Mr. Trump wrapped up the Republican nomination, party leaders expected him to turn toward the general election and campaign in more conventional terms. A month later, and for a moment, Mr. Trump did just that: Eschewing personal taunts and attacks, he defined the presidential campaign as a choice between a hard-nosed businessman and an opponent he said embodied a rigged system.But if Mr. Trumps remarks sketched out the message allies have wanted him to deliver, it is unclear whether he is capable of sticking to the pitch.On Tuesday, he gave an interview to Fox News demanding that Republicans get over their concern about the attacks Mr. Trump has hurled at a federal judge of Mexican descent, just hours after releasing a statement saying he was done talking about the issue. Republican tolerance for Mr. Trumps erratic behavior has evaporated, and one senator who backed him, Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, has already withdrawn his endorsement.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump signaled in their victory speeches how they plan to campaign in the general election: not on narrow promises or practical disagreements about shared goals, but on sweeping and stark themes about the countrys basic character.Mr. Trump pledged to be an America first president, a guardian of the nations traditional interests against foreign forces, and a warrior against a corrupt system in Washington. Mrs. Clinton vowed to stand up for the United States as a big-hearted, fair-minded country open to immigration and diversity and, she said, under grave threat from Mr. Trump.The election, Mrs. Clinton said, would be about millions of Americans coming together to say: We are better than this. We wont let this happen in America.The divisive nature of Mr. Trumps candidacy has left an unlikely opening for Mrs. Clinton to win over moderate Republicans, and she hinted on Tuesday that she intended to make the most of it. Mrs. Clinton gave Sanders supporters a prominent shout-out in her speech, but in almost the same breath she asked for support from the other party.She said she aimed to win over voters who backed me or Senator Sanders or one of the Republicans. In denouncing Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton highlighted his slashing primary campaign, noting that he abused his primary opponents and their families.Many of the critiques Mrs. Clinton leveled against Mr. Trump were essentially nonpartisan, focused on character and his temperamental fitness for the presidency  issues raised as persistently on the right as on the left."}

{"text": "Has the election made you anxious about the future of the United States? Do you feel as if your job is not secure in this lukewarm economy? Are you just generally in the dumps?If so, take a look at the stock market. After a couple of steep sell-offs since last summer, the Standard & Poors 500-stock index has risen to within a whisker of the record high it hit in May 2015.To get to this latest peak, investors have overcome worries about energy prices, China, Europe, monetary policy and, more recently, some unpleasant-looking job numbers and the increased likelihood that Britain may soon vote to leave the European Union.The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 on Wednesday, putting that benchmark up 3 percent for the year.As Ive said before, it can be a mistake to cite movements in the stock market as evidence for your view of the economys strength. This can mean that economic optimists ignore inconvenient stock market plunges and that pessimists self-servingly dismiss the rallies. Whats more, there are many ground-level economic numbers we can use to gauge the future strength of the economy. Why place so much emphasis on a noisy signal like stock prices?Still, when stocks have moved higher for several years, notching the second-longest bull run in Standard & Poors records, the markets optimism should be taken seriously.Indeed, betting against the markets doubters has been a surefire way to make money. As analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch periodically point out, when stock market strategists bearishness increases to certain levels, it has been an astonishingly reliable signal to buy stocks. And right now, the contrarian sell-side indicator is still signaling that stocks will go up.The latest rally, which has lifted the market more than 16 percent from the low point it hit in February, suggests that investors do not believe that the bad jobs numbers are an early signal of a slowdown. They are also probably betting that the Federal Reserve will not be in such a hurry to raise interest rates.Investors may also be seeing less political risk in the United States. The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump favors combative trade policies that, if put into place, might disrupt global commerce, unsettle the markets and unnerve investors. A trade war could harm the earnings of American exporters if other countries retaliated. After watching a difficult few days in Mr. Trumps campaign, investors may have bought more stock this week in the belief that his chances of becoming president have weakened.But there is good reason to believe that investors have become too optimistic. This turbulent presidential campaign will no doubt disquiet investors in other ways.All politics aside, the stock markets rise has made stock prices look expensive when compared with corporate earnings. In aggregate, the companies in the S.&P. 500 were trading at 22 times their earnings for the 12 months through the end of March. That is considerably higher than the average of 16 times earnings for the five years through the end of 2015.Stocks are also expensive when their prices are compared against expected future earnings. The S.&P. 500 is trading at 18 times projected 2016 operating earnings, above the average of the last five years.That high level of optimism can also be seen in how much profit growth analysts are expecting. They project 14 percent this year, and a scorching 17 percent in 2017.Heres the problem: When investors are this sanguine, they are prone to dash for the exits at small signs of trouble. The impetus might come from a hawkish remark about interest rates from an influential Federal Reserve policy maker or a vote from Britain on June 23 to exit the European Union. Or something else that catches most investors by surprise.But this is not necessarily a reason to feel gloomy. When an expensive stock market sells off, its not a given that the economy will also dive. In the last 10 months, stocks sold off heavily on two occasions. The United States economy kept chugging along.Its when the economy stops chugging that it will really be time to avoid the stock market."}
{"text": "Theresa Saldana, who played Joe Pescis wife in the Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull and, in a 1984 television movie, relived a near-fatal knife attack she experienced at the hands of a stalker, died on Monday in Los Angeles. She was 61.Her death was reported by The Associated Press, which did not state a cause.Ms. Saldana began attracting notice in I Wanna Hold Your Hand, a 1978 film about Beatlemania in which she played a star-struck and determined New Jersey teenager, and as a nice girl in a tough neighborhood in the 1980 revenge thriller Defiance. Her career took a giant step forward when she was cast in Raging Bull as Lenore LaMotta, the sister-in-law of the boxer Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro.On March 15, 1982, leaving her apartment building in West Hollywood to go to a music class, she was approached by a man who asked if she was Theresa Saldana. When she said yes, he launched a frenzied attack, stabbing her 10 times in the chest, arms and legs with a hunting knife.She survived only because a passing deliveryman stopped his truck, fought off the assailant and held him until the police arrived. Ms. Saldana spent the next three and a half months in a hospital.I will never forget the searing, ghastly pain, the grotesque and devastating experience of this person nearly butchering me to death, or the bone-chilling sight of my own blood splattered everywhere, Ms. Saldana told a judge in 1984.Ms. Saldanas attacker, Arthur Jackson, was a Scottish drifter who had become obsessed with her after seeing I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Defiance. He entered the United States illegally and tracked her down with the help of a private detective.In his diary he wrote that he was on a divine mission and intended to win Ms. Saldana by sending her into eternity. After the attack, he wrote a letter to Ms. Saldana saying that he regretted using a knife on her because a gun would have given me a better chance of reunion with you in heaven.After her recovery, Ms. Saldana formed Victims for Victims, an organization devoted to helping others who had suffered violent attacks, and to campaigning for anti-stalker laws.Mr. Jackson, after serving 15 years in prison, was extradited to Britain for trial in connection with a 1966 robbery and homicide. He was sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he died in 2004.Ms. Saldana quickly resumed her acting career. After the TV movie Victims for Victims: The Theresa Saldana Story, she appeared in the 1984 Charles Bronson film The Evil That Men Do and in guest roles on several television series.In the early 1990s, she had a starring role in the television series The Commish as Rachel Scali, the wife of the police commissioner Tony Scali, played by Michael Chiklis.Theresa Saldana was born on Aug. 20, 1954, in Brooklyn. She took dance lessons as a child and, after suffering a serious shoulder injury while part of a tumbling team, enrolled in acting classes at 12.After being spotted in the Off Broadway musical The New York City Street Show in 1977 she was cast in the 1978 film Nunzio, an Italian-American family melodrama.Victims for Victims was her most visible role, and her most unusual. She played herself, and a doctor and paramedic from the 1982 attack played themselves as well in the emergency-room scenes.Dr. Eugene Keller, who had treated Ms. Saldana at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, told The New York Times in 1984 that the filming was disorienting. Theresa began to moan, and I asked her, Are you O.K.? Are we hurting you? And she said, No, Im fine. Im acting.Ms. Saldana said: Working on the film released a lot of tension for me. As we shot, I felt elated and creative. I felt that I was capable of anything. How many people are offered the opportunity to go back in time and relive a traumatic experience, but without any of the physical or emotional pain that they felt the first time?She later wrote a memoir about her attack, Beyond Survival (1987).In the 1980s she appeared in small roles on Cagney & Lacey, Falcon Crest, MacGyver and other series.Ms. Saldanas first marriage ended in divorce. Her survivors include her husband, the actor Phil Peters, and a daughter, Tianna Saldana Peters."}
{"text": "American Tunes(Nonesuch)Allen Toussaint sings just once on his final album, American Tunes, but its a moment worth savoring. The song is Paul Simons American Tune, a secular hymn of perseverance, and he starts out solemn, backed only by an acoustic guitar. He waits a full two minutes before tolling a chord at the piano, as punctuation for the first line of the bridge: And I dreamed I was dying. He plays it on the offbeat, naturally.Mr. Toussaint, who died last year at 77 after performing a concert in Madrid, was a soft-spoken yet statesmanlike eminence of New Orleans music: a pianist, singer-songwriter, producer and arranger whose influence ran deep through soul and rhythm and blues.He also loved jazz, and made a recent album loosely in that lineage  The Bright Mississippi on Nonesuch in 2009  with the producer Joe Henry. American Tunes is a follow-up of sorts, in that it was also produced by Mr. Henry, with choice collaborators, including the tenor saxophonist Charles Lloyd and the guitarist Bill Frisell, who help serve up a courtly version of the Billy Strayhorn ballad Lotus Blossom. They also join Rhiannon Giddens on a pair of vocal pieces by Duke Ellington: Come Sunday, imploring and formal, and Rocks in My Bed, stomping and sly.But even with these reference points, the albums jazz affinities feel less meaningful than its resonances with New Orleans. Several tracks feature Mr. Toussaint alone at the piano, and theyre reminders of the regional traditions he elegantly upheld.In particular they recall the New Orleans piano legend Professor Longhair; Mr. Toussaint had a formative and special admiration for him, like Matisses relationship to Czanne. Two of the solo pieces, Hey Little Girl and Mardi Gras in New Orleans, are Professor Longhair tunes; a third, Big Chief, was one of his calling cards, written by Earl King. The dignified calm with which Mr. Toussaint plays these rollicking tunes almost suggests a sleight-of-hand: hes not showing you how much work it takes to make this music sound so effortless.Smooth elegance is more his style, as he demonstrates on a pair of tracks featuring Van Dyke Parks on a second piano: Danza, Op. 33, by the Creole composer Louis Gottschalk, and Southern Nights, which Mr. Toussaint wrote in a pastoral frame of mind. As for the valedictory title track by Mr. Simon, another longtime friend and collaborator, Mr. Toussaint takes care to keep it buoyant. Oh, but its all right, he sings persuasively. Its all right, its all right."}
{"text": "Good English is a small-time band from Oakwood, Ohio, three sisters with a garage rock vibe. In Brooklyn, this week, they became pariahs.The women have found themselves at the center of a debate about sexual assault after a pre-sentencing letter written to a judge a few months ago by one of the sisters, Leslie Rasmussen, involving the case of a Stanford University student who was convicted of sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman, was made public. Ms. Rasmussen, in her letter, described the student, Brock Allen Turner, as a childhood friend and an elementary school classmate, and defended him.In rapid succession, Good English has been dropped from several Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to play, as well as the Northside Festival, a weeklong music festival that began on Monday. Other festivals have also announced that the band will no longer be performing.When people choose to defend something, then I think they should be held accountable for it, said Daniel Stedman, a founder of the Northside Media Group, which runs the Brooklyn festival.After Mr. Turners sentencing last week, Mr. Stedman said he found himself moved to tears as he read the graphic courtroom statement from the woman whom Mr. Turner sexually assaulted. The statement has been widely distributed since, describing the attack and what followed.How does the average person who is really upset and troubled about the Brock story, how does somebody participate in that, making right of a wrong? Mr. Stedman said. We are really just one tiny, infinitesimal part of that puzzle, but I think it was a no-brainer for us.In her letter, Ms. Rasmussen, 20, says that there was a distinction between rape and Mr. Turners case, and suggested that alcohol was to blame for his actions.Mr. Turner, 20, a swimmer at Stanford, was found by two passers-by, partially clothed behind a trash bin on campus, on top of the 23-year-old woman, who was incapacitated by alcohol, according to the authorities. The passers-by stopped the assault and held Mr. Turner down as he tried to flee.I dont think its fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesnt remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him, Ms. Rasmussen, who plays drums in the band, wrote. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campus isnt always because people are rapists.Mr. Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault for the attack, which took place in January 2015. This week the judge in the case, Aaron Persky of Superior Court in Santa Clara County, Calif., came under withering criticism from the public for the sentence he imposed: six months in jail and probation.Ms. Rasmussens letter was part of a package of letters sent to the judge on behalf of Mr. Turner before his sentencing, a standard practice in which people seek to influence a sentencing decision by sharing their experiences of the defendant. His father also sent a letter that had an even more explosive effect when it was made public this week; he said that the episode had affected his sons appetite and that, in particular, he no longer enjoyed rib-eye steaks.Following the firestorm her letter provoked, Ms. Rasmussen said that her words were being twisted and that she was being unfairly stigmatized. This appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved, she said in a statement.Ms. Rasmussen also believed that the letter to the judge was private. But a spokesman for the court said she was wrong  such letters, like most documents entered into the court, are a matter of public record.Within hours of Ms. Rasmussens letter being made public by New York magazine, Good English was removed from a roster of Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to perform in the coming days, including Rock Shop in Gowanus, Industry City Distillery in Greenwood, Gold Sounds in Bushwick, and Bar Matchless in Greenpoint.We dont want to be affiliated with anyone thats going to try to victim-blame or even just downplay rape, said Larry Hyland, an owner of Bar Matchless.Mr. Hyland said he had received over 50 emails and posts on the bars Facebook page demanding that the bands show be canceled. Some of the messages, he said, included threats to confront the band members if they did perform.We didnt cancel the show because of censorship, he said, adding that while he disagreed with the content of Ms. Rasmussens letter, he understood the impulse to want to help a childhood friend. I wanted to avoid an unsafe environment.On Tuesday, the Dayton Music Art and Film Festival near the bands hometown announced that it, too, was removing the band from its September lineup. Such actions should not be defended, friend or not, the festival wrote on its Facebook page. On Wednesday, Behind the Curtains Media, the public relations firm that represented Good English, dropped them from its client roster.In her statement, Ms. Rasmussen attributed the fallout from her initial letter not to what she wrote, but to the overzealous nature of social media. In particular, she lamented the uproar of judgment and hatred unleashed on me and the effect it was having on her musical aspirations."}
{"text": "Times Insider shares historic insights from The New York Times. In this piece, David W. Dunlap, a Metro reporter, looks back at some of The Timess  stop-press orders.The first edition of next mornings New York Times was roaring off the presses at 9:37 p.m. on Sunday, March 31, 1968, as President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed the nation on television.We already knew what the story was: The president had decided to curtail bombing in Vietnam. Reporters at the White House had been given advance copies of the speech just before 8 p.m., and our correspondent Max Frankel had written the news that was leading the newspaper, under a three-column headline.Larry Hauck, the assistant news editor in charge of the night operation, liked what he saw when a stack of copies, still warm and smelling of ink, was delivered to the third-floor newsroom from the basement pressroom. Nice paper, he said.The next words, from someone watching the speech on TV, were: My God!Contrary to anyones expectation, the incumbent Democratic president  elected four years earlier in a landslide before being beleaguered by a war that had fractured his party  was saying he would neither seek nor accept a nomination to run for another full term.And so came Mr. Haucks moment, the one that editors dream about and dread, the one in which they pick up the phone and bark out that crisp, unmistakable, immemorial command:Shut down the presses as soon as possible and make sure none of the papers now being printed are distributed in the city.Hmm. Not much romance in that.But thats what Mr. Hauck said. (He allowed 50,000 copies of the first edition to be released from the pressroom in order to reach the planes, trains and long-haul trucks that were waiting to carry them across the country.)A stop-press order, like the one given last Saturday morning when Muhammad Alis death was confirmed, is so rare that colleagues remember who made the calls, even if there isnt much drama to the call itself.David Geary, a former editor on the news desk, is credited with three press stops: on Sept. 3, 2005, to account for the death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist; on May 1, 2011, when President Obama announced the killing of Osama bin Laden; and on June 24, 2011, when the New York State Legislature passed, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed, a measure giving a legal standing to same-sex marriage.By his own account, it took Mr. Geary those three times to work up the confidence needed simply to holler, Stop the presses.Election night in 2000 was such a roller-coaster ride that two stop-press orders were given. Tom Jolly, now an associate masthead editor, described the scene in the newsroom at 2:15 on Wednesday morning when Times reporters learned that Vice President Al Gore was preparing to speak with supporters, presumably to concede the race to Gov. George W. Bush:The executive editor, Joe Lelyveld, ordered us to stop the presses to print a new headline, Bush Appears to Defeat Gore, and a new story that began with the unequivocal lead: George Walker Bush was elected the 43rd president of the United States yesterday by one of the tightest margins in history   But moments after we sent the pages to the press room, we learned that Gore had been told to hold off on his concession speech because Florida was still in doubt. Joe stopped the presses again, backtracking to the headline that had been on the page most of the night, Bush and Gore Vie for an Edge, and a new lead saying that the outcome of the race seemed to balance on no more than a few thousand votes in Florida. It was the seventh version of A1 that went to the presses that night.The news desk editor who was responsible for calling the pressroom, Mr. Jolly said, was Bob Sheridan, an unflappable pro who brought a nearly affectless calm to the most frenzied situations.On July 17, 1996, Trans World Airlines Flight 800 crashed as it took off from Kennedy International Airport. Jesse McKinley, then a news assistant, remembered Mr. Sheridan picking up the phone and, like he was ordering the worlds worst pizza, practically whispering  without emotion, per Bobs manner  Stop the presses. Mr. Sheridan wasnt much more audible on May 19, 1994, when confronted with the news that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had died. As Mr. Jolly recalled:He simply picked up the phone and said in his quiet voice: Weve got to stop the presses. We just got word that Jackie Onassis is dead. When he hung up, I said: Bob, thats it? You dont yell it? Thats so disappointing. "}
{"text": "It is not every day that two prominent lawyers are brought before a federal grand jury and directed to provide documents and testimony about conversations they had with a wealthy client.But that is what happened with two partners at Williams & Connolly, the prestigious Washington law firm, who are representing Morris E. Zukerman, a former Morgan Stanley banker and oil investor. Last month, Mr. Zukerman was accused of failing to pay $45 million in income and sales taxes on works of art and profits from the sale of an oil company.A series of court filings in Mr. Zukermans pending criminal case in Federal District Court in Manhattan shines a light on the often-unseen role lawyers can play in nonpublic tax investigations by the Internal Revenue Service and federal prosecutors. In the filings, federal prosecutors in Manhattan raised the prospect of potential conflict of interest for the two lawyers, who are trying to negotiate a plea deal for Mr. Zukerman.Typically, lawyers cannot be compelled to testify or produce evidence against a client in a grand jury investigation. But in rare cases, judges can require it, if there is evidence that clients communication with their lawyers was done purposely to further a crime or a fraud. In the law, it is known as the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege.The indictment of Mr. Zukerman comes as the leak of the Panama papers  confidential documents from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama that catered to the very rich  has helped renew interest in the lengths to which wealthy people will go to avoid paying taxes.Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Zukerman, 71, failed to report a profit from the sale of an oil company that would have generated $31 million in income taxes and misled his accountants and lawyers in the course of an I.R.S. audit. He also had expensive paintings that he bought for his Upper East Side home shipped to Delaware and New Jersey to avoid paying sales tax, prosecutors say. He is expected to plead guilty later this month.The two lawyers from Williams & Connolly, James A. Bruton III and James T. Fuller III, are both seasoned white-collar defense lawyers who specialize in tax law. They were ordered last summer by a Manhattan federal judge to appear before a grand jury that was investigating Mr. Zukerman to determine whether he had used the lawyers during the course of that I.R.S. audit and inquiry to conceal his activities.Prosecutors, in a filing with the court, said Mr. Zukerman had the lawyers prepare a tax protest letter that challenged certain audit determinations previously made by an I.R.S. auditor.A federal appeals panel upheld the judges directive to the lawyers in a decision last October. The brief ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit did not name either of the lawyers or Mr. Zukerman because the grand jury investigation was continuing at the time.Federal prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, asked another federal judge on Wednesday to decide whether Mr. Brutons and Mr. Fullers appearances before the grand jury pose a potential conflict of interest and whether Mr. Zukerman was sufficiently aware of those potential conflicts.Wearing a dark suit and round tortoiseshell glasses, and using a cane, Mr. Zukerman told Judge Analisa Torres of the Federal District Court in Manhattan that he was aware of a conflict of interest and was waiving his right because he was the source of the information his lawyers gave the I.R.S.The judge pressed him several times but eventually allowed Mr. Zukerman to waive his right to raise the conflict as a future issue.The so-called Curcio hearing is used in federal court to make sure a criminal defendant is fully aware of the ramifications of retaining a lawyer who may have a potential conflict of interest.Prosecutors said in one letter that Mr. Bruton and Mr. Fuller could be witnesses at Mr. Zukermans trial as a result of the defendants use of the attorneys to convey false information to the Internal Revenue Service during a civil audit.It is uncommon for the government to subpoena lawyers to testify before a grand jury, said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of criminal law at Columbia University.This case itself highlights the complications obtaining such testimony can create. And it involves a target apparently ready to plead guilty, Mr. Richman added.There is no suggestion in the court filings that either lawyer did anything wrong.But the unusual series of events underscores potential conflicts that can occur in tax evasion cases involving wealthy individuals who rely on a bevy of legal and accounting experts to give them advice and help find ways to minimize tax burdens.In light of the potential conflict, Mr. Zukerman had reached out to another lawyer, Henry Putzel III, who was at the hearing.Representatives for Williams & Connolly declined to comment for this article.The seemingly awkward situation between the lawyers and a client stems from a 2012 audit by the I.R.S. related to Mr. Zukermans sale of a stake in an oil company for $275 million, according to the indictment. But when he was audited, Mr. Zukerman failed to provide documents to his accountant. He later employed Mr. Bruton and Mr. Fuller at Williams & Connolly to challenge the I.R.S.The two lawyers interviewed Mr. Zukerman on June 1, 2012, over the phone. In that interview, he lied about his companys sale of the oil company, according to the government. When he was later asked to provide the documents to support those claims about the sale, Mr. Zukerman emailed, promising to provide the lawyers with all the documentation, which he said was in storage, the indictment says.Yet Mr. Zukerman failed to do so by June 22, when his appeal letter was scheduled to be sent to the I.R.S., and so the final letter sent by Williams & Connolly and signed by Mr. Zukerman was based on false assertions, the indictment says.For two more years, Williams & Connolly sent at least four requests to Mr. Zukerman to provide the documents supporting his claims."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  With public health officials warning of a fast-spreading emergency, House and Senate negotiators will work to reconcile legislation aimed at providing up to $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus and the mosquitoes that carry it, Senator Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday.The Senate last month approved $1.1 billion  far less than the $1.9 billion sought by the Obama administration  in a regular appropriations measure, after four months of sparring with the White House.The House, in turn, approved $622 million in a stand-alone measure that requires all of the money to be reallocated from existing programs, including efforts to fight Ebola.The White House and congressional Democrats have accused Republicans of putting Americans at grave risk by slow-walking the legislation to fight Zika, which can cause serious birth defects, including microcephaly, in infants born to infected mothers. The Zika virus is also sexually transmitted, and health experts say both mosquito control and contraception are needed for protection against infection.Congressional Republicans have said the White House has had sufficient financing to begin addressing the problem using more than $500 million reallocated from anti-Ebola programs in April.We all agree that the Zika virus is a real threat and needs to be addressed, Mr. McConnell, the majority leader from Kentucky, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday morning. Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass a bill here in the Senate to provide funding and resources. The House passed its own version. We are now ready to go to conference and complete a final bill.Shortly after his statement, however, Senate Democrats held a news conference urging Republicans to move faster and approve the full amount of money sought by the White House. The mosquitoes are not waiting for Congress to act, said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said there were five new Zika cases reported on Tuesday in his state. This is an emergency, Mr. Nelson said.So far, the hundreds of Zika cases reported in the United States all appear to have been contracted in Central and South America and the Caribbean, where mosquitoes carrying the virus are now widespread. But experts say mosquito transmission in the United States is inevitable and almost certain to begin in southern states during the summer."}
{"text": "These are grim times for cheap thrills. I knew this way before I sat down for a third helping of Brian De Palmas Dressed to Kill. But there was something freshly moving about listening to the poor, sexually exasperated Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) talk to her shrink (Michael Caine) about faking another marital orgasm. Shes tired of wham-bang specials from her husband. She wants passion. The longer she goes on, the more I thought, Hear! Hear!The capes, remakes and movies engineered for late-year acclaim? Stop playing footsie and make love to me.More, please, of the bloody film ecstasies of Mr. De Palma, the relentless American director to whom the Metrograph, on Manhattans Lower East Side, has devoted the month to cinematic French-kissing  courtesy of a retrospective. Living elsewhere should deter no one from drumming up private De Palma marathons (or finding De Palma, the new career documentary that Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow have made).If you miss homicidal mania, gonzo sexual desire, cruelty lugubriously avenged, camerawork and editing that never sleep, or arriving at the closing credits and exclaiming, Again!, What the hell was that? or sometimes both, then you can certainly salute Mr. De Palma at home.His body of work is large and varied. Hes given us carnal disturbances (Phantom of the Paradise); adolescent-hormone horror (Carrie and The Fury), personal dramedy, assorted paranoia thrillers; a couple of moralist combat dramas; and more crime-world escapades than youd think (starting with Scarface and peaking with The Untouchables).Were talking about an auteur but a completely heterogeneous one, whose thematic promiscuity ranges from counterculture-era black comedies (Greetings and Hi, Mom!) to rotten eggs like Mission to Mars (2000) and the notorious, picked-over 1990 turkey The Bonfire of the Vanities. This is also the director who, in 1996, launched the Mission: Impossible series. Mr. De Palma promises nothing (well, he never seems to run out of music; his movies do promise too much of that). He cant even guarantee quality. After almost 26 years, I thought going back to Bonfire would help recast it as a timely (or timeless) race farce. Nope. Its badness is forever.And yet heres the thing about Mr. De Palma. He never stops  never stops trying to pull the rug out from under us, never stops trying to twist our arm, never stops believing that nonsense can be an aphrodisiac, too.I mean, who has better understood the elastic power of slow motion? Its the sort of only-in-the-movies effect that no ones actually experienced but that everybodys felt. Its the speed of dreams and nightmares  REM sleep at minimal m.p.h. With Mr. De Palma, though, the dreams favor the dewy, and the nightmares run red. Death, ecstasy and humiliation can all happen at well under 24 frames per second, all the better for the movies to show us what we see when our eyes are shut.Thats whats wrong with that adaptation of Tom Wolfes The Bonfire of the Vanities. By Mr. De Palmas standards, its bloodless in every way. Even real time feels too slow.In his prime, which was the paranoid Nixon 70s, the excessive Reagan 80s and just a touch beyond, Mr. De Palma made thrillers that thrilled. And cheap was fine. Were cheap. Just dont treat us that way. De Palma didnt. He winked and ribbed and elbowed, but he also knew how to freak you out and turn you on. Theres a spot for perversity and transgression that certain moviegoers have, and Mr. De Palma knew how to hit it. You could count on him to put a frame around desire and fear.In Dressed to Kill (1980), toward the end of her session with Mr. Caines Dr. Elliott, Kate comes on to him. He declines. And a scene later, she is sitting alone at the Met, too distracted to engage with the art. She scribbles in her datebook stuff like nuts, eggnog and pick up turkey! Then a man in sunglasses sits beside her and starts sucking on a golden pen. The next shot shows her with one leg wrapped around the other.He gets up, and she chases after him from gallery to gallery. An Alex Katz, a Frank Stella, Rauschenberg and Johns: all afterthoughts. As they go, the score rises and falls  panting, basically. Then he stops and cruises her, and she walks past, exhilarated but ultimately too embarrassed to respond when he comes up behind her and places a gloved hand on her shoulder. She runs off and looks at a museum map (for sexual orientation, more than anything else).Then she realizes that the glove was hers, and she starts scanning these rooms full of art for the work of trashy masculinity whos getting away. But when she exits, there he is in a cab wagging that glove. She goes to thank him. He pulls her in and starts going to town on her right there in the back seat. The turkeys picked her up!It is such obvious surface, but the surface goes on for miles. As a formalist, Mr. De Palma repeatedly cast his lot with the films of Alfred Hitchcock  in Blow Out, Body Double and Raising Cain, too. The museum sequence is like an exhibitionist Vertigo whipping open its trench coat and flashing its great big Judith Krantz.Mr. De Palmas baldness can still be brow-furrowing. The wonderful Ms. Dickinsons function here is the same as Janet Leighs in Psycho: cautionary. Indeed, Hitchcocks female trouble is also Mr. De Palmas  judgment, sexual confinement. Hes just not as icy. Indeed, Dressed to Kill features the sort of queer killer who slays out of sexual confusion (or jealousy) that cropped up that year (also in 1980, N.Y.P.D. detective Al Pacino went gay, in Cruising, to stop murders in S-and-M communities) and reached a mass-media boiling point 12 years later with Basic Instinct. If youre not straight, these movies end punitively for you.But theres a kind of touching ignorance at work in Dressed to Kill. When the movie wants us to understand transgenderism, it splits the screen and, on both sides, plays an actual talk show featuring Nancy Hunt, who explains her life to a live studio audience. Dr. Elliott isnt on the show; hes watching at home, studying it. Thats this movie: Phil Donahue is its Freud.(Mr. De Palma is stranger with black people in his movies. Theres the fascinating experimental-theater sequence in Hi, Mom! in which a bunch of black actors in whiteface put white audience members in blackface so they can sample the black experience. And Sisters is built around an interracial relationship. But, until Bonfire, those scenes appear to have obviated a reason for black people in his films to do much more than deliver exposition and jive.)But with sex, no one in America is doing this kind of cheap-thrill stuff anymore. The accusations of misogyny against Mr. De Palma were always complicated. Sexuality constitutes a survival skill and power play for some of these characters. The women in a block of his films are more than victims; and carnality is both weapon and currency. In Body Double (1984), Melanie Griffith plays a porn actress named Holly Body. Some of the appeal in casting her had to have been that her mother was Tippi Hedren, the Popsicle at the center of Hitchcocks The Birds and Marnie.Mr. De Palma, who wrote the movie with Robert J. Avrech, gives Ms. Griffith a monologue about her rules for kink that is pretty much unprintable. But I typed it out just to feel the tingle of Ms. Griffiths confident obscenity.Mr. De Palma used to conjure that vicarious kick of attraction  but also the viciousness and risk in it, that the danger for women came at the hands of men. If anything, his true thematic pursuits were privacy and invasions of it. The opening scene of Sisters (1973) is from a television show he cooked up called Peeping Tom. But ways of seeing are also crucial to Casualties of War (1989) and Redacted (2007).The erotics of looking gave his sex movies both some of their sensation and their paradoxical moral tinge: that which feels right but is wrong. There you have the engine for an entire generation of delicious De Palma cousins and knockoffs: the erotic thriller, movies where plot and sensation went at it until some kind of soft-porno-orgasmic ridiculousness was achieved. These films thrived for two decades (Jagged Edge, Body of Evidence, Color of Night) incongruously amid the fear of AIDS and newer sexual freedoms.They treated lust as sin but also as inevitable. In Dressed to Kill, Kate succumbs to both. And paying attention to Mr. De Palmas mastery of them doesnt constitute nostalgia so much as a call to arms. There hasnt been his kind of casual sex in movies for almost a decade. Kates moaning in the back of that cab leads only to bad news. But who cares? Things are so chaste now that Ill even have what shes having."}
{"text": "Nick Jonas, who is 23, made a convincing college student in the television series Scream Queens last season, but he makes an exceedingly unconvincing high school student in the wretched Careful What You Wish For, a film that tries to be both titillating and suspenseful but is neither.He plays Doug, who settles in for a summer on the lake with his parents and stumbles into a teenage boys fantasy: The gorgeous married woman next door, Lena (Isabel Lucas), relieves him of his virginity. Doug is too nave to entertain the possibility that she is merely using him to escape her abusive, heavy-drinking husband (Dermot Mulroney). That possibility becomes a dark reality when the husband turns up dead, and poor Doug is soon thoroughly tangled in a web of deceit.The film, written by Chris Frisina and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum, is trying for steamy but more often achieves laughable, thanks to numbing dialogue, especially for Ms. Lucas. (Right now, she heavy-breathes, dragging him off for a quickie in an inappropriate location. I cant wait.) The movie, with its naughty forbidden-desires story line, seems pitched to the sexy imaginings of teeny-boppers who were fans of the Jonas Brothers, Mr. Jonass boy band, almost a decade ago. But those fans have all grown up now and certainly wouldnt find this comparatively tame, completely predictable movie to be sultry.Careful What You Wish For is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexy talk and some beer drinking."}
{"text": "Stuart Anderson, the founder of the Black Angus Steakhouse chain, known for offering big meals for a small price, died on Monday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 93.The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Helen, said.At its peak, the restaurant chain had more than 120 outlets around the country. It currently has about 46, most of them in California.When Mr. Anderson founded the chain in Seattle in 1964, customers got steak, soup or salad and a baked potato for just $2.99.They were lined up outside the doors, Mrs. Anderson said.But the price did not include dessert. He wanted to get them out of there, she said. That was his whole theory. But he gave them a lot of food for the money.Mr. Anderson was born on Nov. 27, 1922, in Tacoma, Wash. He was a tank driver with Pattons Third Army during World War II. After the war, he bought a hotel in Seattle.As fast as I could, I installed a small bar in the lobby, Mr. Anderson wrote in his 1997 book, Heres the Beef! My Story of Beef. Hookers, seamen, hustlers and wrestlers made up most of my trade.The hotel had a small restaurant. He decided that he didnt like the hotel part, Mrs. Anderson said, but he loved the restaurant part.He opened the first Black Angus in Seattle in 1964. The chain was sold in 1972, but Mr. Anderson stayed on to run it before retiring in the mid-1980s.In addition to his wife, survivors include his daughters, Christopher Carol Gee and Quincy Anderson; a stepson, Michael Ranta; two grandsons; a great-grandson; and a step-grandson.While Mr. Anderson liked steak, he never got the hang of cooking it  or cooking much of anything else.The best he could do, Mrs. Anderson said, would be peanut butter sandwiches or frying eggs, if I werent home."}
{"text": "The conductor Benjamin Zander has long been something of an institution in Boston for his ability to draw refined performances from youthful players. He is also known to a wider world for his preachments on leadership skills at management conferences and the like, upholding possibility thinking, an airy concept he has written about with his partner, Rosamund Zander.It has never been easy to take Mr. Zanders musical measure from a distance, but he gave New Yorkers an extended glimpse at Carnegie Hall on Monday and Tuesday, conducting free programs with his Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, preceded by more or less identical 45-minute talks. Curious, as always, about the Zander phenomenon, I opted for a full immersion.Let it be said at the outset that the performances were generally excellent, and would have been so even if this had been an adult professional ensemble. But there was also something megalomaniacal about the affair, starting with the programs length (some two and a half hours each) and difficulty.Mondays concert ran on, with Glinkas Ruslan and Ludmila Overture, Stravinskys Violin Concerto, Debussys La Mer and Tchaikovskys Fifth Symphony. The Japanese-born violinist Ayano Ninomiya was a brilliant soloist in the Stravinsky, though her efforts were sometimes covered by exuberant playing from the orchestras winds, who could have been held in better reserve.Tuesdays concert opened with Debussys Prlude  lAprs-Midi dun Faune and might have run a bit shorter had Mr. Zander not spoken from the stage at length about the remaining two pieces, Stravinskys The Rite of Spring and Mahlers First Symphony. Yes, that Stravinsky and that Mahler, blockbusters both, on the same program: Probably something no one had been stupid enough to attempt before, Mr. Zander allowed. (In jest, but )This felt almost like a sporting event rather than a concert: Would the young players conquer the behemoths back to back? For the most part, they did, though signs of weariness crept increasingly into the Mahler.In the preconcert talks, Mr. Zander mainly discussed his methods in founding the orchestra (in 2012, as an offshoot of his longstanding Boston Philharmonic) and sustaining it. The players range from 12 to 21 and are evidently highly susceptible to his possibility thinking. This is not the same as positive thinking (as in the power of), Mr. Zander insists, though the differences are not always clear to an outsider. Nor does that outsider know what to make of mystical concepts like shining eyes, which Mr. Zander aims to see in both players and listeners.Is there something cultlike here? Indeed, Mr. Zanders biography on the Boston Philharmonic website calls him the center of an intense, at times almost cultlike following. Is this a good thing? What cannot be gainsaid  though it is surely not the whole answer  is that he can achieve often glowing results from young musicians with, yes, shining eyes."}
{"text": "PITTSBURGH  When injuries depleted the Mets lineup last summer, they turned first to the Atlanta Braves in a deal for Kelly Johnson, the versatile utility player. They did it again on Wednesday, obtaining Johnson from the Braves for the Class AA pitcher Akeel Morris.It shows the players, Hey, were not going to stand pat here, Manager Terry Collins said. I think its important guys know that.Back with Atlanta this season, Johnson, 34, hit just .215 without his usual power; he had only one home run and six doubles in 132 plate appearances. But he has started games at every infield position and both corner outfield spots over the last two seasons, and gives the Mets a veteran they trust for a lineup that is missing catcher Travis dArnaud, first baseman Lucas Duda and third baseman David Wright, who are all injured.We talked to Kelly a bunch in the off-season about bringing him back, because we liked his versatility, clubhouse leadership and veteran presence, but we really didnt have a fit, said John Ricco, the Mets assistant general manager. Now we do, and it was an opportunity to bring in a guy who was part of the team that got to the World Series and gives our manager someone who can play first, second, third and the outfield.Last years deal with the Braves also brought Juan Uribe  who now plays for Cleveland  and signaled that the Mets were serious about upgrading a lineup that soon added Yoenis Cespedes. Johnson hit .250 with five home runs down the stretch and started a game in the World Series.Morris, 23, had a 4.62 E.R.A. and six saves for Class AA Binghamton. He appeared in one game for the Mets last season."}
{"text": "Thomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valleys venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84.His longtime assistant, Kathy Daly, said Mr. Perkins died after a prolonged illness, which she did not specify.Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth.Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins  and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif.  became a destination for other venture capitalists.Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google.The firms success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world.Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board.He also publicly broke with Kleiner Perkins in 2014 after writing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he compared the progressive war on the American 1 percent to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The comments set off a firestorm, and the firm moved to distance itself from Mr. Perkins, who later apologized for his language.David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled Mines Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the Worlds Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkinss legacy wont be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed, though he was a seminal figure for Silicon Valley.In a statement on Thursday, two other Kleiner Perkins co-founders, Brook Byers and Frank Caufield, said Mr. Perkins had defined what we know of today as entrepreneurial venture capital by going beyond just funding to helping entrepreneurs realize their visions with operating expertise.Mr. Perkins was flamboyant with his wealth, though he had said that he was a multimillionaire and not a billionaire, as many believed. At one point he was an avid collector of Bugatti cars; at another, he commissioned a state-of-the-art 289-foot clipper yacht called the Maltese Falcon, telling the CBS program 60 Minutes in a profile that it had cost at least $150 million and less than $300 million.That lifestyle was the backdrop to one of several books he wrote, a novel titled Sex and the Single Zillionaire (2006), which featured a yacht on its cover. For the book, Mr. Perkins had guidance from the romance novelist Danielle Steel, whom he married in 1998; the marriage ended in divorce. He dedicated the novel to her.Thomas James Perkins was born on Jan. 7, 1932, and grew up in White Plains in modest circumstances, attending White Plains High School. His father, Harry, worked for an insurance company, and his mother, Elizabeth, was an occasional seamstress.He became interested in technology early. In a 2007 autobiography, Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins, he wrote that as a youth he assembled television kits and had planned to be a TV repairman.Accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he studied electrical engineering and computer science, earning his bachelors degree in both. He later received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. After working for a time for Sperry Gyroscope Company in Great Neck, on Long Island, he moved to California, where he worked in the technology industry for a decadeHe joined H.P. in the 1960s, working for the companys founders, David Packard and William Hewlett. In his autobiography, Mr. Perkins wrote that Mr. Packard and Mr. Hewlett were restless and driven men.Their aspirations always reached beyond the present success, he added, noting that he had been fortunate to have come knocking on their door.When Mr. Perkins and Eugene Kleiner founded Kleiner Perkins in 1972 (Mr. Byers and Mr. Caufield joined later), Silicon Valley knew little of venture capital, and the men had the field largely to themselves, investing in fledgling companies like Tandem Computers, Applied Materials and Genentech.Mr. Perkins later stepped away from active venture investing and joined several corporate boards over the years, including Compaq Computer and News Corp. Compaq was purchased by H.P. in 2002, and Mr. Perkins joined H.P.s board in 2005, not long before its chief executive at the time, Carly Fiorina, was fired. Mr. Perkins supported Ms. Fiorinas recent run for the Republican presidential nomination.Before his marriage to Ms. Steel, Mr. Perkins was married to Gerd Thune-Ellefsen, a Norwegian whom he had met skiing near Lake Tahoe, until her death in 1994. He is survived by two children from that marriage, a son, Tor, and a daughter, Elizabeth."}
{"text": "LONDON  Guy Hands, the founder of the private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners, denied in court on Wednesday that he had made up conversations he claimed he had with senior executives at Citigroup ahead of a disastrous deal to buy EMI in 2007.His firm is suing Citigroup in London over several misrepresentations that Mr. Hands claimed Citi executives had made to induce him to bid for and complete a deal to buy the storied music label.The acquisition  valued at 4 billion pounds, or about $5.8 billion  came at a high cost for Mr. Hands, damaging his reputation as a shrewd investor and erasing much of his personal fortune.EMI was seized by its lenders in 2011 as it faced a crushing amount of debt. It was acquired by the Universal Music Group the next year.Mr. Hands said on Wednesday that he had personally lost 200 million euros, or about $227 million, on the deal.On Wednesday, Citigroups lawyers pressed Mr. Hands on the motivation behind his lawsuit against the bank and questioned whether a claim Mr. Hands filed against the lender in 2013 in Manchester while separately pursuing litigation in the United States was an attempted shakedown.At the time, Terra Firma accused Charles O. Prince III, the former chief executive of Citigroup, of fraud. That claim is no longer part of the case.Mark Howard, a lawyer for Citigroup, questioned whether the claim against Mr. Prince had been filed to embarrass the bank and to force a settlement.That is not correct, Mr. Hands said.This is the second time that Terra Firma has gone to court over claims that Citigroup misled Mr. Hands about EMI and the auction process.A jury in Manhattan found in 2010 that Citigroup was not liable in the matter, but that verdict was later thrown out by an appeals court.The latest trial began on Tuesday before a judge in London and is expected to last into July. Mr. Hands, who will continue his testimony on Thursday, is the first witness to testify in the case.Citigroup has said that it believes that Terra Firmas lawsuit is without merit and that it did not make any dishonest statements to Mr. Hands or Terra Firma throughout the EMI auction.Terra Firma is seeking 1.5 billion in damages, reflecting its full investment, as well as lost profits and management fees it claims it would have earned had it not invested in EMI in the first place. Citigroup provided 2.5 billion in financing for the transaction.As part of the lawsuit, Mr. Hands said he was told by David Wormsley, Citigroups head of investment banking in Britain and a longtime banker to Mr. Hands, that Cerberus Capital Management was prepared to bid 262 pence a share for EMI and that Terra Firma would need to make a higher bid than that to win the auction. Terra Firma ultimately was the only bidder for EMI in May 2007.Terra Firma also claims that two other former Citigroup executives made additional misrepresentations to Mr. Hands about the banks view on the financial health of EMI to encourage him to complete the deal after winning the auction. Terra Firma injected 205 million in additional equity into the company after discussing financing with Citigroup, Mr. Hands said.On Wednesday, Mr. Howard pressed Mr. Hands on why his conversations with Mr. Wormsley  which Mr. Hands said were a driving force behind the deal discussions  were not documented in the minutes of meetings by Terra Firmas investment committee or the boards of its general partners.The real reason there is no documentation is because none of it is true? Mark Howard, a lawyer for Citigroup, said.That is not correct, Mr. Hands said.Mr. Hands said he did not always share the sources of his information with the committee.On Wednesday, Mr. Hands also said it was market practice for information to be shared by agents of selling companies about the price other bidders were willing to pay in a confidential auction, even when there was a confidentiality agreement in place between the parties.It happens on an everyday basis in the City, Mr. Hands said, referring to Londons financial center."}
{"text": "It is a holy week in every gamers calendar. Each June, 50,000 members of the video game industry descend upon Los Angeles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the industrys most-anticipated trade show. E3 often features the unveiling of big titles and celebrity appearances from the likes of Paul McCartney and Rihanna.Now, however, E3 is in flux.Some publishers have walked away from E3 2016, which is set to begin next Tuesday. Electronic Arts, the company behind titles like Medal of Honor, will not be there and is instead hosting its own mini-expo the same week. Activision, which publishes Call of Duty, chose to forgo its booth at E3 for the first time since 2010. Disney also will not be there after the company announced last month that it was shutting down its video game publishing business.The Entertainment Software Association, which organizes E3, plans to fill the gap with virtual reality and mobile games. This years show will have more than 90 mobile gaming exhibitors and a pavilion dedicated to online and mobile games, while 53 exhibitors will showcase virtual reality tech, up from 27 in 2015.The changes spotlight how E3, which once defined the most innovative and exciting developments in games, is working to remain relevant in a shifting industry.In the past, E3 brought publishers, retailers and the gaming press together to provide a sneak peek of new games for consoles and PCs. But the rise of digital distribution services and free-to-play mobile games has made physical game stores increasingly obsolete. And many publishers can speak directly to gamers via social media and video-sharing platforms like YouTube and Twitch, making it less necessary for companies to wait for a yearly event to tell gamers what they have been up to.To my eye, E3 is being overtaken by much better channels to gamers and the online-ness of great games themselves, said Bruce Hack, the former vice chairman of Activision Blizzard, who now works as a consultant. E3 is not yet fossilized, but its unique position is eroding.Rich Taylor, a senior vice president at the Entertainment Software Association, said E3 evolved every year and remained the launchpad for remarkable advancements from the fastest-growing sector of the entertainment industry.The forces that E3 contends with are evident in the numbers. Sales of physical games  discs in boxes  are declining. This year, mobile gaming revenue will overtake that of PC games for the first time, according to a report from Newzoo, a game research company.With digital distribution of games on the rise, the importance of retail has weakened, said Itzik Ben-Bassat, former executive vice president for global publishing at Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard publishes World of Warcraft, one of the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing games.As the market structure has shifted, E3s importance has been in constant decline, said Mr. Ben-Bassat, who now runs Gong, a trending news site and app.This is not the first time E3 has undergone a metamorphosis. In 2006, the association scaled back the show after attendance hit 70,000, to eliminate overcrowding. It was reintroduced in 2007 as an invitation-only event that took place largely in hotel conference rooms  and was rapidly denounced for what was seen as a lack of energy and excitement. That format continued for another year before a flashier E3 was reinstated in 2009.Yet even as E3 returned to its revelry-filled self, sometimes featuring lavish parties and concerts by Usher and Eminem, game publishers began chipping at the shows dominance by holding their own events to reach consumers directly.Blizzard, for example, has created its own annual event called BlizzCon, held in Anaheim, Calif., usually every November. BlizzCon, which the company uses to promote its major gaming franchises, is open to the public; last years event attracted more than 25,000 people.After many years of continuing to grow our audience around the world, we thought it would be cool to provide a way for our employees and players to be able to celebrate their passion for Blizzard games together, a Blizzard spokesman said.E3 also faces increased competition from fan-focused expos and conventions like Comic-Con, the Penny Arcade Expo and MineCon, the annual Minecraft convention held in a different city every year.Interest in getting closer to consumers seems to have at least partly motivated Electronic Arts to split from E3 this year. The companys new event, EA Play, will start two days before E3 at a venue inside the L.A. Live entertainment complex, within walking distance of the Los Angeles Convention Center, where E3 is being held.EA Play will include news conferences, playable versions of featured games and opportunities for gamers to speak to the developers behind coming titles.The necessity to bring all retailers in one place is less significant today than it was 15 years ago, said Chris Bruzzo, Electronic Arts chief marketing officer. We see an opportunity for us to try some new things that reflect where the company is going.Mr. Taylor of the Entertainment Software Association said it was not a coincidence that EA Play was being held the same week as E3 and in a nearby venue.Companies have come in and out of the show for years, he said. Consistently, people find ways to attach themselves to E3.At the same time, the association is trying to diversify its events. Last month, the group said it planned to hold a public event called E3 Live alongside E3 for the first time. The free event will serve as a kind of mini-E3 where gamers can interact with industry types and play games. More than 20,000 gamers are expected to attend.The attempt to open it to the public is maybe too little too late, Mr. Ben-Bassat said, but it is indeed the right direction for E3 to survive."}

{"text": "The effort to root out the corruption and violence that have long plagued the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City entered a new phase on Wednesday when Norman Seabrook, the politically powerful leader of the 9,000-member corrections officers union, was arrested on federal fraud charges.Mr. Seabrook, who wields enormous influence in both city and state politics, is charged with channeling $20 million of union retirement and operating money into a hedge fund  in exchange for bribes that were expected to total hundreds of thousands of dollars.Federal prosecutors say that Mr. Seabrook placed the unions money in a high-risk hedge fund, just as other investors were getting out if it. In exchange, they say, he received a $60,000 kickback delivered in a bag from Ferragamo, one of his favorite luxury goods stores. When F.B.I. agents searched his house on Wednesday morning, they found a Ferragamo bag along with 10 pairs of Ferragamo shoes.The case will no doubt bring further scrutiny to the inner workings of the union, which has long exerted an unhealthy level of control over the citys corrections system.The union presidents arrest came just one day after five corrections officers were convicted of assault charges for the savage beating of a Rikers Island inmate named Jahmal Lightfoot in 2012. Mr. Lightfoot testified that he had been singled out for a beating by officers who believed that he thought himself tough.According to prosecutors, five corrections officers punched and kicked him in a cell covered by a drapery, away from video cameras, while three other guards stood outside the cell. Mr. Lightfoot, who suffered fractures of both eye sockets, says that he suffered headaches and blurred vision for months after the attack. The officers face up to 15 years in prison for the most serious count alone.This ghastly episode is an example of the deep-seated culture of violence at Rikers Island documented in a 2014 report from the Justice Department. The report describes guards severely beating and injuring inmates, whom they accused of minor misconduct or perceived acts of disrespect.Mr. Seabrook on Tuesday tried to explain away the beating, saying that corrections officers were merely doing their jobs. This response comes as no surprise, given his efforts to obstruct reforms and investigations meant to hold guards accountable for crimes against inmates.Corrections officers have been loyal to Mr. Seabrook, who has controlled the union for more than two decades. But they could well change their minds once they learn that he placed their retirement money at risk."}

{"text": "Though our lesson plans will be on vacation until mid-August, election news will continue to dominate the headlines all summer long.Here are a few ways students can keep up with the candidates, campaigns, conventions and controversies  and make their own opinions heard.1. Keep Track of the Twists and Turns2. React to What You Read Post your thoughts on any Times article, Op-Ed, image, video or graphic any week from June 17 to Aug. 26 to enter our Summer Reading Contest. Speak back to media with projects suggested by our partners at Letters to the Next President, from making political art to creating infographics. Post your creations to Twitter, Instagram or Facebook with the hashtag #2NextPrez. Join conversations on social media using relevant hashtags, like #Election2016, #ImWithHer, #Trump2016 , #feeltheBern, #GOPconvention, #DemConvention, etc. Take photos around a political issue you care about, or that illustrate the democratic process itself. This compilation of Times images from the 2016 primaries proves that its not necessary to have a candidate in the shot to compose an eloquent image. Create an editorial cartoon, like these that won our contest last fall. Retell a political news story in just six well-chosen words.3. Figure Out Where You StandWhat party best expresses your beliefs? These quizzes can help you figure that out:Which candidate do you support? Though the quizzes below were created when the field was much larger, answering their questions can still help you think through where you stand on key issues:4. Adopt an IssueClimate change? Education? Immigration? Choose something you care about, and read, watch and collect pieces related to it from different news sources and points of view.To get out of your filter bubble and help surface information from sources that will challenge your thinking, make sure to seek out information from a variety of political points of view, and from around the world.For inspiration, here are some short student videos about issues. You might also answer our Student Opinion question, What Issues in the 2016 Presidential Race Are Most Important to You?5. Watch the ConventionsRecent political conventions have grown so scripted and choreographed that moments of true spontaneity are rare. This year, when history seems to be providing little guiding precedent, could be the one that shatters the calm, writes Jeremy W. Peters in his Five Ways the Republican Convention Could Still Be Contentious.Both parties hold their conventions this July, the Republicans in Cleveland from the 18th to the 21st, and the Democrats in Philadelphia July 25th to 28th.Polls show that Republicans, especially, are concerned about the future of their party  but Bernie Sanders has vowed to take his campaign all the way to the convention, so Democrats, too, are facing big questions.Both parties approach the conventions with significant unease and hurdles to overcome, Times reporters write in Republicans Want Their Party to Unify Behind Donald Trump, Poll Shows:Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are widely disliked by voters, and both parties will need to repair schisms that might spell doom in an ordinary election year. But this, of course, is no ordinary year.Mr. Trumps and Mrs. Clintons soaring levels of unpopularity are extraordinary for the likely nominees of the two major parties. Nearly two-thirds of voters, for example, say that Mr. Trump is not honest and trustworthy. Just as many say the same of Mrs. Clinton. Strong majorities of voters say the candidates do not share their values.What do you expect to happen? Why? That leads us to our next idea 6. Predict the UnpredictableIn one of the most unpredictable election seasons in modern memory, Donald Trump is Exhibit A.The Upshot explains why were so bad at predicting rare events:Anyone can simply be unlucky. But there are systematic biases and errors our puny human brains tend to make repeatedly when we try to predict the future, some of which are evident in the biggest political and sports upsets of 2016.Make five to 10 predictions about what you think will happen before Election 2016 is over, and post or save them somewhere  perhaps challenging your friends or classmates to do the same. Then, follow the news to see how close you come, and to analyze what you got right and wrong.Before you do, however, you might want to read The Upshots Nate Cohn on What I Got Wrong About Donald Trump.7. Get to Know the CandidatesYour first step: the candidates own websites:Hillary Clinton\nBernie Sanders\nDonald J. TrumpYour second: the Times candidate pages for each:Hillary Clinton\nBernie Sanders\nDonald J. TrumpAnd, because they have all been in the public eye for decades, Times search and archives can also help: NYT Archives (@NYTArchives) June 8, 2016 NYT Archives (@NYTArchives) July 30, 2015For a comprehensive look at their statements on the issues, check out ProCon or use the resources in our lesson plan on the topic.For many more specifics about each, see our list at the bottom of this post under Ask the Big Questions.8. Monitor the MessagingWhat are the candidates and campaigns saying? How much of it is true? What platforms and mediums are they using? What messages have worked? What missteps have they made?You can keep track of presidential advertising via this page and see Times analysis of both the candidates own advertising, and the attack ads aimed at them. As you watch,  you can use our TV commercial analysis chart.You can fact-check the candidates statements  and suggest your own ideas for fact checks  with this Times interactive.But you can also keep abreast of the far more unpredictable messaging you can find on social media. Eighteen-year-old Jiachen Jiang, one of our spring Student Council members, explains:Social media, in all its myraid forms, has proven that it influences far more of the population than technology-obsessed millennials.  However, it is undoubtedly a double-edged sword, easily turned against even the most tech-savvy candidates.From Trump and Clintons hapless Hispandering to Sanders increasing loss of control over vitriolic Bernie bros, candidates are finding that not all publicity is good publicity.Over the course of the summer, Ms. Jiang suggests analyzing the social media output of the candidates and answering the following questions, supporting your responses with specific tweets and posts:9. VolunteerThis list, from Youth Service America suggests all the following and many more, and provides links to explain how:10. Ask the Big QuestionsUpdated | July, 2016This tumultuous election season has raised questions about everything from whether the primary system is fair to whether or not Donald Trump will actually respect the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law.Seventeen-year-old Eli Miller, another of our Student Council members, suggested that we pose questions for students that help them understand the quirks of the nominating process, and whether or not that process is truly democratic. Should either party reform its system? If so, how, and why?Taking his advice, we found a starter list of related questions Times journalists have posed in sections like Room for Debate, The Upshot and elsewhere. Choose one that matters to you, and read the related article. What would you answer?

{"text": "TOKYO  Osamu Suzuki, the chairman of the Suzuki Motor Corporation, plans to give up day-to-day control of the automaker he has led for most of the last four decades, in response to a scandal over improper fuel economy tests on cars that the company sells in Japan.The move is the latest management reshuffle resulting from a wave of testing scandals in the auto industry.Suzuki Motor said on Wednesday that Mr. Suzuki, 86, would give up his position as chief executive but retain the title of chairman. It said the move was intended to make management responsibility clear over the testing problem, which it revealed last month.The company did not say who would replace Mr. Suzuki as chief executive, but his son, Toshihiro, is widely seen as a leading candidate. Toshihiro Suzuki became chief operating officer and executive vice president last year. The company will need to name its new chief executive before its annual shareholder meeting set for June 29, when Osamu Suzukis resignation from the role is scheduled to take effect.Carmakers industrywide have been struggling to restore public trust and erase doubts about the fuel-test results they report to governments around the world. Globally, the reporting of fuel economy and pollution ratings is under especially close scrutiny after Volkswagen of Germany admitted last year that it had installed software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. The companys chief executive has since resigned.The turmoil has also hit Japanese automakers. Last month, the president of Mitsubishi Motors, Tetsuro Aikawa, said he would resign after the company disclosed that its engineers deliberately used unapproved test procedures that exaggerated fuel performance by as much as 15 percent on some models. The company had been using the procedures for several decades, and the financial shock caused by the admission drove it to seek a rescue from another Japanese carmaker, Nissan Motor.Suzuki has said that although its testing procedures had deviated from government standards, they had not produced exaggerated mileage ratings, and there was no need to restate any published ratings.The issue was nonetheless a blow to Suzukis reputation. The company said another executive, Vice President Osamu Honda, would resign his position and that board members would give up half their executive bonuses for the latest financial year. Senior managers, auditors and nonexecutive directors would also take cuts to their monthly pay, of between 10 and 40 percent, for periods of from three to six months, Suzuki said.Osamu Suzuki married into the carmakers founding family in the late 1950s, taking his wifes family name, a not-uncommon practice among prominent Japanese families. He became president of Suzuki Motor in 1978.Mr. Suzuki has stepped back from the front line of Suzukis management before. He traded the presidents role for the more ceremonial title of chairman in 2000, but potential successors suffered ill health. He returned to day-to-day control as chief executive in 2008 after a son-in-law, Hirotaka Ono, died of pancreatic cancer.Suzukis problematic fuel tests involve the way its engineers calculated what is known as running resistance, or the effect that tire friction and other factors have on fuel consumption under various driving conditions.Suzuki said last month that mileage tests at its development track in central Japan had produced inconsistent results, which engineers attributed to wind. Instead of running multiple tests to produce an average, the engineers cut corners by extrapolating running resistance from past tests. That was a violation of regulations, the company said, but did not distort results beyond the standard margin of error.Suzukis indiscretion came to light after Japanese regulators ordered all carmakers to re-examine their testing methods after the revelations at Mitsubishi, which hit the companys sales and sent its share price plummeting. Nissan agreed to give Mitsubishi a $2.2 billion lifeline in exchange for about one-third of the company."}
{"text": "CHICAGO  Many tech start-ups are in the business of making themselves successful. But some entrepreneurs have set up businesses with the express mission of training others to be successful in the tech sector.Several of those start-ups have dedicated themselves to creating programs, incubators or accelerators to train blacks and Hispanics for tech jobs.Their efforts are coming at a time when Silicon Valley has increasingly been scrutinized for its lack of diversity. But instead of leaving it to the tech giants to solve the problem alone, some see their own connections as a way to address the issue.From NewME in California to Blue1647 in Illinois, entrepreneurs are cultivating talent within the groups that have been underrepresented at established tech companies.Data from the Census Bureaus American Community Survey shows that there are more black and Hispanic students graduating with computer science degrees than there are  working at tech jobs, despite campus recruitment efforts from companies like Google.Founders of these start-ups say tech companies have to try new ways of seeking out talent. With the guiding hand of these programs, many alumni have gone on to secure tech internships and jobs or form their own start-ups.Angela Benton, founder of NewME, an accelerator for entrepreneurs of different backgrounds, said she faced skepticism about whether her business model was possible. Instead, Silicon Valley influencers encouraged her to scour elite institutions to find minority entrepreneurs to help.I spent almost a year in Silicon Valley meeting with people, getting advice on our business model. They all wanted me to play it safe, said Ms. Benton, who was a teenage mother and went from graphic design to helping start B20, a black tech innovators site, in 2007. I dont come from that background.Ms. Benton said she discovered that some of the most talented entrepreneurs werent aiming to create the next billion-dollar start-up. Rather, the entrepreneurs of color were content to begin a company worth a few million dollars.Over five years, the NewME accelerator has helped businesses raise more than $20 million in venture capital funding. It offers one-week programs and has more than 20,000 members so far.Many established accelerators and start-up incubators tend to be in regions and cities dominated by existing tech or business firms. For the new entrepreneurs, a key to success is setting up in underserved areas.Emile Cambry Jr., the founder of the nonprofit tech incubator Blue1647, chose to open its first location in Chicagos Pilsen neighborhood, a primarily Hispanic neighborhood southwest of the citys bustling downtown.The classes are not for dabblers. The company developed its curriculum to train students in Java, Ruby and other computer languages. It also provides a shared work space for entrepreneurs and connects students with internships, jobs and networking opportunities.Since its founding in 2013, the nonprofit has expanded to Chicagos Roseland neighborhood, as well as St. Louis and Compton, Calif. A low-income area of Austin, Tex., is next.Some alumni have interned at Google, Answers.com and other tech companies, while others have started their own businesses or landed tech jobs, Mr. Cambry said.The organization has trained more than 2,400 youths and adults in its sequential classes or 12-week boot camps, the majority of whom identify as black or Hispanic.Even with tech backing, many of these ventures initially faced hurdles, like raising money or finding the best way to publicize community outreach.Kenneth Watkins, chief strategy officer at Blue1647, said he noticed that the Hispanic girls shone the most at the groups internship accelerator programs, but there werent enough organizations catering to their specific needs, like bilingual skills. So in 2014, he started Latina Girls Code, which also offers training in 3-D printing and creating wearable tech. The program has only trained 83 Latinas, most of whom are third-generation, in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other programming languages.But working with overlooked communities comes with unexpected challenges. For example, Mr. Watkins noticed that Chicago workshop locations discouraged some students and their families from participating because some feared being targeted by immigration officials or the police while traveling to the city.We now have to do an Aurora thing and a Joliet thing  we have to do two different events, because they just cant travel but so far, he said.To expand, the founders of such ventures realize that collaborating with investors and tech companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google brings in more resources for their programs.Doing so takes networking in tech circles and reaching out to companies who aim to diversify their staff and directly asking for their support, Mr. Watkins said. For him, it meant going to meet-ups and emphasizing to tech giants that supporting his organization could help close the diversity gap.A lot of people like what you do until you start asking for money. Then it becomes quiet, Mr. Watkins said. You really have to have people in those positions who can really be advocates.In addition to supporting NewME, Google has worked with ventures like Code2040 and Manos Accelerator through Google for Entrepreneurs, which financially supports community start-up programs. That initiative is separate from its diversity team, Roya Soleimani, a Google spokeswoman, said in an email, adding that the company had increased the number of universities from which it recruits.She said the company continued to search for people who can bring new perspectives and life experiences to our teams. She pointed to a Google blog post from June 1, 2015, reporting that 2 percent of Google employees were black and 3 percent were Hispanic.Some of the most successful graduates of the start-ups would never have considered careers in technology. Nehemiah Bishop, a Chicago South Side native who earned his accounting degree at the University of Illinois-Chicago, slept in hotels and lived in vans at one point in his life, but he received help from his brother and others to finish college.An accounting internship made him realize that it wasnt the field he wanted to pursue. He enrolled in Blue1647s HTML, CSS and JavaScript class and a Ruby on Rails class, which helped him land a Google internship. He was hired as an industrial engineer at UPS in May.At Blue1647, when you come in to take a basic coding class, to get help with a start-up or to just come in for help with your homework, you come in to a family environment, Mr. Bishop said. The incubator provides that extra help of guidance from individuals that look like you, individuals that care for you as much as your parents care for you and who believe in you without a doubt.Many of these ventures say that to really make a difference, more collaborations with established tech companies are necessary.Dominic Liddell, founder of Tech While Black, a Chicago nonprofit organization that provides job and networking opportunities for black designers and developers, said he still faced an uphill battle in reaching out. The group has secured GitHub, Code Climate and other software companies for sponsors, but he has hired a business development manager to build more relationships. The nonprofit was founded in 2014 and has helped more than 1,300 members through workshops and meet-ups.Theres enough out there for everybody to eat, Mr. Liddell said. If we stay in our neighborhoods instead of moving out, we get the jobs and go back and hire from our neighborhoods and train from our neighborhoods, then we have a better outlook over all."}

Its kind of saying that Im of that heritage, but I dont quite fit, says the 25-year-old Japanese-American singer. Indeed, much of the album  like the equally brilliant Bury Me at Makeout Creek before it  concerns crises of identity, sprung in part from her globe-trotting childhood and in part from being a woman in the still very male-driven indie-music scene. In the video for the fuzz-rock stomper Your Best American Girl, she balances a desire to be the little spoon with a hilarious send-up of the white bros that dominate her genre. Im a woman making music, she says, and it turns out I have to be a feminist to do that."}

{"text": "At a time with more scripted television than ever, how long does it take to finish a season of a show?According to Netflix, not much time at all.Subscribers who finish the first season of a show generally do so in a week, Netflix says. And those viewers are dedicating a significant amount of time to do it: They watch about two hours a day.These are some of the findings from a study Netflix released Wednesday after tracking its global base of subscribers and how they watched the first seasons of more than 100 television series during a recent seven-month stretch.After three years of studying original series releases and nine years of streaming over all, we can now identify some patterns, finally, Cindy Holland, the vice president for original content at Netflix, said in an interview.Weve gotten past, The binge watch, it happens! Now were trying to distinguish that different series are consumed at different rates, Ms. Holland said.Using median figures, the findings reveal that some shows are consumed quickly, while others are viewed at a slightly slower clip. The stuff viewers lap up? Horror and thrillers. The shows that take them slightly longer? Political dramas and sophisticated comedies.Here are some of the trends Netflix identified among first-season viewers:How quick: The median amount of time for a user to finish a season is four days. Time spent watching each day is about two hours and 30 minutes.Genre types: Horror, thrillers, sci-fiExamples: Breaking Bad  Sons of Anarchy  The Fall  The Walking Dead  American Horror Story  Orphan BlackThese kinds of shows were truly propulsive, straight-up genre stuff, Ms. Holland said. These are the ones that people push through much faster and not necessarily have to think about the issues or unpack all the jokes or take a break from the big drama moment.How quick: The median amount of time users take to finish a season is five days. Time spent watching each day is about two hours.Genre types: Dramatic comedies, crime dramas, superhero showsExamples: Fargo  The Blacklist  Orange Is the New Black  Nurse Jackie  Marvels Jessica JonesHow quick: The median amount of time to finish a season is six days. Time spent watching each day is about one hour 45 minutes.Genre types: Political dramas, irreverent comedies, historical dramasExamples: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt  Arrested Development  House of Cards  Homeland  The West Wing  Mad MenWhen jokes from a show like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, are being fired at a machine-gun rate, people tend to take more time between episodes to digest them, Ms. Holland said. And the company found that with political dramas like House of Cards and The West Wing, viewers tend to take a breath, she said.Netflixs study included current shows (Fargo) and those off the air for some time (The West Wing). The streaming service studied only serialized shows and programs that were globally available on the service (Netflix has more than 81 million users). The study covered viewing habits from October 2015 to the beginning of May. Subscribers who did not finish the first season of a show were not included.While Netflix contends that the binge model is what viewers want, some traditional network and cable executives continue to argue that their week-to-week rollout of original programming keeps their shows in the cultural conversations for months at a time. Bingeing is obviously an option at other streaming services; several contacted Wednesday did not have comparable data, or did not respond to requests for it.But Ms. Holland said the study proved to the company that, yes, Netflix viewers were inclined to binge, and reinforced the companys faith in its policy of releasing all the episodes of an original series at once.And because the study is based on rookie seasons, what happens after?The general trend we noticed is that subsequent seasons are consumed even faster than the preceding seasons, Ms. Holland said."}
{"text": "The New York City Education Department is expected to announce a plan on Thursday to help black and Hispanic students gain acceptance to some of the most competitive high schools.There are eight specialized high schools in the city, like Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Technical High School, that admit students based solely on their performance on a single assessment, the Specialized High School Admissions Test. But while black and Hispanic students make up 68 percent of the citys public school students, they are just 11 percent of the students at these academically rigorous schools. Asian students make up about 54 percent of those admitted, and whites 27 percent.At Stuyvesant, which historically requires the highest score for acceptance, black students earned 10 of the 953 seats in 2015.The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a complaint in 2012 with the federal Education Department calling the admissions process at the schools racially biased.The city cannot change the admissions criterion at these schools; that would require an act of the State Legislature. So in an effort to diversify them, the de Blasio administration hopes to help more students pass the existing hurdles.Many of those who gain admission take intensive test preparation courses, so the city will expand free tutoring and offer test prep through after-school programs at middle schools.Because black and Latino students take the test at a much lower rate than their white and Asian peers  22 percent compared with 52 percent  the Education Department will hire up to five outreach workers to recruit more students from underrepresented groups. And this fall, the city will give the admissions test during the school day at five pilot schools, rather than asking students to travel to another testing site on a weekend, when they might have other obligations.Our specialized high schools need to better reflect the diversity of our neighborhoods and our city while maintaining their high standards, and this strong package of reforms is an important step forward, said Mayor Bill de Blasio. His son, Dante, attended Brooklyn Technical.The citys program of outreach and test preparation will cost $15 million over the next four years and it will begin this summer, to prepare students for the October test.Earlier this year, a group of Democratic state legislators introduced their own plan to diversify specialized schools, a package of initiatives that also included recruiting underrepresented students.The citys ninth specialized school, Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, uses auditions in its admissions."}
{"text": "The designer Jonathan Anderson splits his time between London, where his namesake brand is based, and Paris and Madrid, where Loewe, at which he is the creative director, is, though he was in New York last week, shooting a campaign with Steven Meisel. The constant bounce around the world didnt seem to faze him.Work is easy if you have major teams around you, he said, three iPhones sandwiched in one hand (personal; J. W. Anderson; Loewe). You just let people do what theyre best at.Mr. Anderson, 31, is a believer in division of labor, who prefers to think of himself as an editor rather than a designer. Its a peculiarly modern point of view (at least, admitting it is). Over the course of a spin through Printed Matter, the art book- and zine-shop where he likes to conduct New York interviews, the better to shop all the while, I called him a factory foreman and an impresario. He agreed with both.Sometimes you think, God, how do you let someone just come into the brand? but its very fulfilling, he said. You become like a manager and manage the situation.It is a logic that led him to open his first store, J. W. Anderson Workshops, in the Shoreditch neighborhood of London in January, carrying a mix of his J. W. Anderson collection and a series of collaborations with individuals who catch his fancy. They cycle through at a rate of about one a month, and draw in people whose names may not be familiar to many fashion consumers: the photographer Ian David Baker, the editor and publisher Luis Venegas, the ceramist Giles Round.Im easily bored, so its quite perfect to do different things, Mr. Anderson said. I cant do everything on my own.His latest collaborator is far less obscure: Hes the fashion-obsessed rapper ASAP Rocky, a fan of J. W. Anderson, who adapted some of Mr. Andersons designs into a capsule collection of tracksuits, knit hats and fur teddy coats.What we do is completely different, Mr. Anderson said, but fundamentally, thats the beauty of fashion: You can meet in the middle on it. Everyone likes fashion.Rocky was a customer first, buying Mr. Andersons collections and eventually turning up at his show. He wore one of Mr. Andersons zippered track tops in a music video, but he aspired to a full tracksuit. Thus was a new collaboration born.I would never want to be a fashion designer, he said via email, having been unreachable by conventional means. But I do have a lot of ideas. Still, he has shown up often at fashion events and shows, name-checked brands and collaborated with Guess Originals and Adidas Originals.The new collection, which can be pre-ordered on the J. W. Anderson website on Thursday and will be available from the Shoreditch Workshops store on Monday, ranges from $275 for a beanie to $1,300 for one of the teddy coats. Rocky, as he is known, was given free rein, even down to the design of a new logo, spelling out, inscrutably, JWA AWGE.AWGE, ASAP?The first rule of AWGE is dont ask questions about AWGE, Rocky wrote in explanation (or not). The second rule of AWGE is that if you are a part of AWGE, then you cannot discuss AWGE. The third rule of AWGE is refer back to rule number one if you have any questions.Pressed to elaborate, he offered: It is a collective of creatives that come from multiple disciplines including visual arts, fashion and music. No one needs to know what the letters stand for. We know what it is, and thats how we want to keep it.We does not, apparently, include Mr. Anderson, who didnt seem to mind.He was allowed to do whatever he wanted to do, Mr. Anderson said. I dont know what it means. I was just like, O.K., fine, whatever you want. I like that."}

{"text": "Two mismatched teenagers forge a tentative friendship on a Rhode Island beach in Indian Summer, a melancholy, rather wan comedy-drama by Gregory S. Moss that opened on Wednesday at Playwrights Horizons. Although the plays four characters are given sensitive readings by the fine cast, Mr. Mosss play remains so muted that it feels like an overcast day at the shore, when you were hoping for blazing sun and frothing surf.The central characters are the 16-year-old Daniel (Owen Campbell) and the 17-year-old Izzy (Elise Kibler). They are a natural ill fit. Shes a brash local girl who comes from a large Italian-American family. Hes from out of town  one of the summer people Izzy and the locals deride  and has been parked by his mother with his grandfather, George (Jonathan Hadary), for an indeterminate time.Withdrawn, and exuding a terminal sense of uncertainty  unsurprisingly, given that his mother hasnt said when shell be back to pick him up  Daniel nonetheless engages with Izzy when she approaches him on the beach one day. Their rapport moves gradually from tetchy and antagonistic to confiding and intimate, although neither can fully acknowledge  or perhaps even understand  how close they have become.This is in part because their budding friendship has an obvious obstacle in the person of Izzys boyfriend, Jeremy (Joe Tippett). Hes 10 years older than Izzy although he acts like a slightly shiftless teenager, confiding at one point to Daniel that he spends too much time getting wasted.Interspersed with the scenes between the younger characters are monologues from George, addressed directly to the audience, in which he talks (at sometimes tedious length) about the weather, the mysterious allure of the ocean and sea life. Noting the resemblance between the depths of the sea and life on solid ground, he says, Most of life on earth is mysterious and dark and remains unseen.All the characters have their moments of lyricism, some unlikelier than others. Izzys tough hide eventually cracks open to reveal the dreaming young woman within. The notion of moving to Hawaii brings a spurt of fantasy, as she imagines that the horizon is broad and curved like a smile, and the ocean whispers. She also expresses a sense of self-alienation, saying: I lay in bed at night and Im like, So where is it, Izzy? Where is your life? Wheres it gonna start? The answer: Somewhere else.Ms. Kibler manages to make the somewhat contradictory facets of Izzys character seem cohesive, although Izzy is more believable when shes doing hard-edge and spunky than when shes reeling off flowery verbiage. As the introverted Daniel, Mr. Campbell shades his performance with glints of loneliness and confusion. (I could have done without the characters cute-quirky fondness for crocheting to ease his anxiety.)Mr. Tippett radiates charisma as the blustery but big-hearted Jeremy, his buoyant physicality bringing welcome liveliness to the stage. And as always, Mr. Hadary is excellent, making Georges nautical-themed monologues and weather updates seem perfectly natural, if not wildly compelling.It is in these passages that Mr. Moss tends to billboard his larger themes. Speaking of the weather phenomenon of the title, for instance, George says that its like a pocket of unexpected time, a little reprieve between seasons, in which things and people, lives and stories, are given a chance to collect themselves, to reconfigure and, possibly, to change.Indian Summer, directed at a languid pace by Carolyn Cantor, has the laid-back feel of an Annie Baker play, with its meandering dialogue and slightly alienated characters. But it also feels vaguely formulaic, as if assembled from a kit to create, well, the kind of delicate-hued, funny-sad plays that Ms. Baker specializes in.All the talk of the ocean and its bottomless depths brings to mind the plays flaws: it has a washed-out, watery quality, and the characters, while agreeable company, are not exactly bottomlessly interesting."}
{"text": "Elizabeth and Philip Jennings have sported a lot of great disguises over the course of The Americans, but in the Season 4 finale, Persona Non Grata, Philip wears one of my favorites: hair brushed back, wire-rim glasses, saggy mustache, the beaten visage of a J.C. Penney mens outerwear model whos just been laid off. I think of this disguise as Sad Walter White.The parallels between the Jenningses story and Walters in Breaking Bad have been on my mind this season. When FX announced that The Americans would end after two more seasons, I thought that setting an end date was a good idea, partly because, much like Breaking Bad, it involves an intimate cat-and-mouse game and has a sense of compounding dread that cant be spun out endlessly.There is, however, a core difference between the two dramas. Breaking Bad explored the idea that Walters crimes, however costly and evil, brought him for better or worse to his authentic self. I liked it, Walter confessed to Skyler in the finale. I was good at it.I liked it describes pretty much no ones relationship to his or her job on The Americans, no matter how good he or she is at it. American or Soviet, they are weighed down by their work, tired of the compromises, resentful of systems that use them in the name of a larger cause.The Americans, the masterly, melancholy fourth season proved, is more like Breaking Sad.Certainly William (Dylan Baker) doesnt feel self-actualized, not as he lies alone, disillusioned, dying in an isolation chamber as he is literally eaten from the inside by the product of a mission he didnt believe in: The biological agent he was smuggling for a government he doesnt trust to use it.His F.B.I. captors, watching him from behind protective glass, may be on the winning side of history. But they havent felt especially victorious either, as theyve been humiliated by the discovery of a bug in their offices and haunted by the sense that whatever cases they win are symbolic at best. A plot is discovered, a diplomat is banished and the process grinds on.Season 4 finds the Cold War at a point when, as on a serial cable drama, the end is in sight but it still promises plenty of heartbreak before we get there. (The season spanned from just after Ronald Reagans Evil Empire speech to the 1984 Super Bowl, whose broadcast included the Apple Macintosh ad in which a young woman hurled a sledgehammer through a video image of Big Brother.)All this adds a note of gloom even to the tensest moments in this drama: Pursuer or pursued, no ones heart is entirely in this spy game. Philip, always ambivalent, finally says this to himself flat-out through the coded message of his EST session, where he vents about work at the travel agency: You dont want to make arrangements for people you dont know and dont give a [expletive] about.The EST meetings, which seemed like a quirky period detail at the beginning of Season 3, have grown into a kind of Americans equivalent to Tony Sopranos sessions with Dr. Melfi. But theres a sense that, while it may make Philip feel better to talk, Western self-help doesnt have any concrete answer for him. Like Denniss offer of a Coke to the dying William, its a palliative better suited to first-world problems.Philip has been on this track for a while, though Marthas ruination and Paiges entanglement in the family secret hasnt helped. Elizabeth, as Gabriel described her earlier, has always been the stalwart, certain in the rightness of their cause if not that of every individual objective. Shes been the more classically Walter White-esque figure, in that she embraces her work  likes would be the wrong word  and seems invigorated rather than sapped by it.But Season 4 finds her less certain. Her long con involving Young-hee shook her in a way few missions have. (Plot-wise, that plan  involving both a faked affair and a faked suicide  seemed a rather elaborate bank shot simply to get people alone in a secure office, but it was emotionally devastating.)Elizabeth is still a different person from Philip, still more dedicated to her ideals. But she seems less certain that those ideals live in her homeland anymore. When she wonders whether her hometown, Smolensk, is anything like she remembers it, you get the sense shes not talking about the architecture.The finales soundtrack highlight was Leonard Cohens Who by Fire, a soulful litany of ways to die. It fits this season, which has been a catalog of loss: Nina, summarily shot after a last act of conscience; Martha, mercifully and horribly shuttled to a chilly life of loneliness; even Agent Gaad, killed for nothing in a botched K.G.B. operation in his Thai hotel.Add to the casualty list Paiges innocence, though the upside is that the season brought out a striking performance from Holly Taylor. Through her, The Americans has become a kind of heightened version of a familiar teenage coming-of-age story: Her so-called spy life.Like many teenage protagonists, Paige discovers disillusioning secrets about her parents. She becomes socially conscious and questions the faith (or rather, lack of faith) she was raised in. She rebels against her parents, is surveilled by them, carries the weight of their mistakes. (Parenting tip: If your minor daughter has a hard time dealing with learning that her entire identity is a lie, thats on you, not her.) Eventually, through her surprising affinity for small-scale spycraft, she finds that shes more like her folks than she might admit.After months of lying and worrying and seeing her mother stab a guy in the neck, she finally gets the chance to be a teenage girl, hooking up with the boy down the street. Alas, their romance is star-crossed  or hammer-and-sickle-crossed  and her dad forbids it as one more too dangerous intimacy in a series full of them.On the plus side, she has a brother  no, not the one playing 8-bit games on the home computer, but Philips Russian son. We first heard of him in Season 1, but his introduction, confirming that he exists, is the closest thing to a bombshell in the finale.But the manner in which Persona Non Grata brings him in shows that the series, guaranteed two more seasons to end on its own terms, feels no more obligation to gin up excitement with cliffhangers. It would have been easy to structure the episode so that revealing his plan to find Philip was the final scene: I need to know  boom!  closing credits.Instead, it ends in the dark of a January night, with a front door closing and a light turning off, a tableau not of international espionage but domestic drama. Maybe The Americans, finally, is neither Breaking Bad nor a traditional spy story. Maybe its a teenage horror movie, the kind where the biggest danger, in the end, is already inside your own house."}
{"text": "France, at the moment, is seemingly in chaos. Strikes are disrupting vital public services, including rail travel. Air France pilots say that they, too, will strike between June 11 and June 14, just in time for the European soccer championship which begins in France on Friday. Major unions have called for a national day of protest on Tuesday. All this threatens Frances image, its economy and its security.But for what? The immediate cause is a labor reform bill backed by the government of Franois Hollande that would ease some worker protections in the hope of encouraging job growth. The larger cause is a deep sense of betrayal on Frances left, unhappy with what it sees as a rightward turn by Mr. Hollandes Socialist government.Outrage on the left forced Mr. Hollande to abandon a bill in March that would have stripped some French of their citizenship if convicted of terrorism. Many French see the labor-reform bill as a last straw. Since the Hollande government introduced the bill in March, hundreds of thousands of people have marched in protest across France, clashing violently with police at times.Last month, using its executive authority, the government rammed the bill through a recalcitrant National Assembly. That prompted a series of strikes called by the General Confederation of Labor union, or C.G.T., that disrupted public transportation and rail travel, forced flight cancellations and, last month, caused temporary fuel shortages when unions shut down oil refineries. Now come the pilots, sensing their own opportunity to inflict pain.The Hollande government has already watered down some of the original provisions of the bill, which it regards as essential to reducing an unemployment rate stuck above 10 percent. But Prime Minister Manuel Valls made it clear in an interview last Friday that the government will not back down any further, saying: If we were to give in to the C.G.T., we would never be able to reform France.Meanwhile, some two million foreign soccer fans are expected to arrive in France over the coming weeks, and the terrorism threat level in the wake of attacks in Paris last year and in Brussels earlier this year is high. On Monday, Ukrainian authorities arrested a Frenchman who was apparently planning a series of terrorist attacks during the tournament to protest French immigration policy.In these circumstances, it is sheer folly for the C.G.T. to continue to disrupt vital public services, and outrageous for Air France pilots, generally considered well paid, to strike over the first weekend of the tournament. As Mr. Hollande said on Tuesday, there comes a point when you must realize its time to stop striking. In France, where public opinion is turning against the strikes, that point is now."}

Burke High School.Myeshia Henderson, a spokeswoman for the department, said that two other people, both in their late teens, had suffered injuries that were not life-threatening. A woman in her 60s was treated for a graze wound at the scene, Ms. Henderson said.At an afternoon news conference, Commissioner Evans said the police were canvassing the neighborhood door to door in a search for the suspect or suspects.Asked if the shooting was gang-related, Mr. Evans said it was too early to tell.We dont know if it was a fight that was spilled out, he said. Kids dont fight anymore with their hands, they run and get weapons.Mayor Martin J. Walsh, standing with Mr. Evans, said that trauma counselors would be sent into the school Thursday to help students and teachers cope with what happened.The victim is too young to be gunned down at the middle of the daytime, and the community is sick and tired of the shootings, Mayor Walsh said.Ali Guevara, 18, a senior at the school, was at a Burger King nearby when the shooting took place. She said that she heard shots, and that a friend told her the shooting took place after someone at the school pulled a fire alarm, an account repeated by several other students to local television reporters.Mr. Evans said he understood that a fire alarm had been pulled at the school but had no clue whether it was related to the shooting."}

{"text": "How do you soften up a tough-guy hero anyway? The conventional approach is to make him a widowed or divorced dad who pines for his little girl. That, or give him some icky disease. With these and other clichs so close to hand, its actually refreshing to pick up THE SECOND GIRL (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $26), a sweaty crime novel by the veteran police detective David Swinson, and come across a protagonist with a cocaine addiction.Frank Marrs drug habit goes to explain why, other than the obligatory attitude problem, he was forced into early retirement from the Washington, D.C., police department and now works as a private investigator for a lawyer hes sweet on. It also explains why Marr is staking out a drug house in a nasty part of town  not to put the dealers out of business, but to steal their product. Imagine his surprise when he finally makes his move and discovers Amanda, a bruised and brainwashed 16-year-old from Virginia chained up in the bathroom. Like other impressionable teenagers seduced by flashy dealers, Amanda was being groomed for work in a brothel, and when word goes out about her rescue, Marr finds his services in demand by parents of other missing girls. Aside from his drug dependency, Marrs real secret is that hes a big old softy. Although brutal, even murderous, when dealing with pimps and drug dealers, on some sad cases, this decent, complicated man feels bad taking a clients money. Despite a pledge to steer clear of cases involving children, which often end badly, he agrees to look for another runaway. But this girl, Miriam Gregory, has taken to her new life and fights like a pro from being rescued. After this job, Im done with teenagers, Marr swears, especially suburban white girls on crack. If theres any comfort in managing a drug habit, being outwitted by teenage girls and trying not to kill people, its knowing that, to old friends on the force, youll always be one of us.Were off to the rugged northern coast of Maine in BOAR ISLAND (Minotaur, $26.99), by Nevada Barr, who sets all her mysteries amid the natural grandeur of our national parks. Anna Pigeon, the weathered law-enforcement park ranger who gives this long-running series its sturdy backbone, has been recalled from Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado and temporarily assigned to the assorted land areas that make up Acadia. This places her in the middle of the raging lobster wars, a territorial dispute among Maine fishermen angling for survival in their dwindling industry. As usual in this series, the most vivid scenes occur outdoors. An eerie underwater sequence captures the weighted silence in which a solitary lobster poacher goes night diving. A search by water for a girl and her dog, lost on a fogbound coast, casts another beautiful setting in a dangerous light. But this time out, the bond between Anna and nature seems to have frayed, strained by the authors attempt to draw too many other characters into this private world. Although Barr effectively delves into virgin territory by exploring the mind of a murderer, the gaggle of Colorado friends who followed Anna east are too much baggage for someone who works best when she works alone.LOST AND GONE FOREVER (Putnam, $27) is a hoot. The latest entry in Alex Grecians lurid series of Victorian melodramas expands on the authors obsessive interest in Jack the Ripper with another potboiler in which Saucy Jack is alive and well and still tormenting Inspector Walter Day of Scotland Yards elite new Murder Squad. The language is ripe, if not entirely in period, and the plot, which turns on the fate of the missing Day, is a hot mess. But Grecian introduces a fantastically devilish pair of bounty hunters who call themselves Mr. and Mrs. Parker (As long as he remained alert, Mrs. Parker posed no danger to him, according to the besotted Mr. Parker) and creates some extravagantly overwritten scenes in which a majestic emporium called Plumms is ceremoniously erected and oh-so-carelessly destroyed. Although Jack appears to have dispatched the Parkers at the end, the resurrection of those Grand Guignol figures shouldnt be a problem for an inspired fabulist like Grecian.in SEVEN DAYS DEAD (Minotaur/Thomas Dunne, $25.99), another atmospheric mystery by the Canadian author John Farrow, the wild and windswept island of Grand Manan proves an invigorating holiday spot  provided visitors survive the treacherous crossing over the Bay of Fundy. Inspector mile Cinq-Mars, a retired detective from the Service de Police de la Ville de Montral, happens to be here on vacation on the stormy night that Alfred Orrock dies. Boss and owner of everything on the island, according to those who loathed the man, this tinpot despot didnt deserve his peaceful death, any more than he deserved the loyalty of his daughter, Madeleine, or the islanders who depended on him for survival. Farrow is an authoritative writer who creates characters with depth and plots that say something about them. (Even a minor character like a burnt-out officer with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police makes a strong impression on his do-or-die posting.) But the authors true forte is setting, especially rock-cliff islands lashed by storms, buffeted by winds and clinging to generational secrets that poison the lives of people who keep reminding one another to keep your knives sharp."}

{"text": "JUST before he took the stage at Dont Tell Mama to perform a sensitive rendition of Shes a Woman, an aching love song from the musical Kiss of the Spider Woman, James Corden had been preaching his gospel on how to be a popular entertainer.Whether he is performing for millions or for the 25 or so people at this midtown Manhattan piano bar, hosting CBSs The Late Late Show as he has done since March 2015  or the Tony Awards as he will do for the first time on Sunday  Mr. Corden said that inclusiveness was crucial to success.The worst way you can approach a show is to go, Oh, were all in a club here  did you not get that? he said in an interview on Saturday night. My job is to widen that net.A British actor and Tony Award-winner, Mr. Corden, 37, is no longer the cautious if ambitious relative unknown who crossed the Atlantic last year to take over CBSs 12:37 a.m. time slot.Having reinvented The Late Late Show as an engine for viral bits of musical comedy and franchise segments like Carpool Karaoke and Drop the Mic, Mr. Corden was brimming with confidence (and a vodka with cranberry juice) ahead of the intense preparation for the Tonys that would begin that Monday morning.He was excited to host an awards program that holds so much personal value for him, and was full of ideas for how he believed he could make it connect with a wider national audience. Even the fleeting idea that it could all go wrong seemed to tickle him.If I slip and land on my nose and get a nosebleed, what do I do? he asked. With a laugh, he answered himself: You and every other millennial will have a great internet meme. I will have a horrifyingly embarrassing moment in my life. But thats why you do it.On paper, Mr. Corden was a mathematical lock to host the Tonys, which will be held at the Beacon Theater. He is an increasingly visible personality on the network that broadcasts the ceremony, and has performed on Broadway in The History Boys and One Man, Two Guvnors, which in 2012 earned him the Tony for best leading actor in a play.He also played the Baker in the 2014 film adaptation of Into the Woods, and has made The Late Late Show a home for his musical-theater peers, like Mondays all-star Carpool Karaoke segment featuring Lin-Manuel Miranda, Audra McDonald, Jane Krakowski and Jesse Tyler Ferguson.The online ubiquity of these segments has helped The Late Late Show thrive in an intensely competitive environment in which more than a dozen late-night series vie for TV ratings and internet clicks.Mr. Corden claims not to pay attention to Nielsen ratings for his CBS program. For $1 billion, I couldnt tell you how many people watch our show. (It averages about 1.3 million viewers a night, behind NBCs Late Night With Seth Meyers, which averages about 1.6 million.)But, he said, I know, absolutely, the figure that have watched bits online. The Late Late Show YouTube channel has surpassed one billion views, with more than 100 million of those views coming from his Carpool Karaoke segment with the pop singer Adele.The opportunity to host the Tonys was especially meaningful because, Mr. Corden said, the awards represent the true and pure voice of theatergoers. As proof, he cited the year that he won his trophy, prevailing over formidable fellow nominees Philip Seymour Hoffman, James Earl Jones, John Lithgow and Frank Langella (again nominated this year).In that instance, when he was not perceived as the favorite, Mr. Corden said, If it could be bought, it would have been.Mr. Corden said there had been a slight rumbling for him to host the Tonys last year, only a few months after taking over at The Late Late Show, but it would have been just too early.The 2015 Tonys show, hosted by Kristin Chenoweth and Alan Cumming, was watched by around 6.5 million viewers, a sharp decline from past years, when high-profile entertainers like Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris have served as M.C.Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner, the longtime executive producers of the broadcast, were coy about the selection process for its host, but acknowledged in an interview that a wide range of participants, including CBS, the Broadway League and the American Theater Wing needed to be satisfied.Mr. Kirshner said that, aside from Mr. Cordens other talents and the arsenal of signature bits he has developed on The Late Late Show, the most important qualities Mr. Corden would bring to the Tonys are his infatuation for the theater and his love for the community here.Ben Winston, an executive producer for The Late Late Show and a lifelong friend of Mr. Cordens, said that pressure at the program had eased considerably since his debut.Now, Mr. Winston said, celebrity guests are sufficiently familiar with its welcoming atmosphere and grab bag of comedy segments that, when Anne Hathaway appeared on the show in a rap-battle segment with Mr. Corden, David Schwimmer emailed the next day asking to perform a rap battle of his own.For all his success, Mr. Winston said, Mr. Corden remained an authentic fan of pop culture who never outgrew a boyhood love for the stage.As a child, Mr. Winston said, He probably wasnt watching movies and looking at movie stars and going, Im going to be that guy. He was looking at Jean Valjean. Maybe not Danny in Grease.Anna Wintour, the Vogue magazine editor in chief and Cond Nast artistic director, who has become one of Mr. Cordens most prominent fans, said the enthusiastic, inclusive spirit that he projects on TV persists after the show is over.You always feel youre in on the joke with James, she said. He wants to bring you into his world.She added: In our very first email exchange  Id never met him  he said, Will you be my best friend? Hes that sort of person.Should she see Mr. Corden at the Beacon striding down the aisle with a glint in his eye and the intention of incorporating her into a comedy bit, Ms. Wintour said: I will be happy to see James. As long as I dont have to sing.This year, Mr. Corden said he hoped to open the Tonys with a song for, like, the theater kid who lives in Michigan or Nebraska, who just dreams of being on a stage.For them, he continued, this night being on TV is everything, and I wonder if we can open our show for them.He may not have to do much heavy lifting at the Tonys when audiences will be focused on the fortunes of Hamilton, which has become an international sensation and is nominated for a record 16 trophies.Still, Mr. Corden was tight-lipped about how he might incorporate the musical or Mr. Miranda, its star and creator, into his segments on the program. And not even Ms. Wintour, who is a fashion consultant for the Tonys, would say if Mr. Corden might be wearing a tricorn hat during the evening.As mistress of the wardrobe, I cannot give away any house secrets, she said.After about an hours conversation at Dont Tell Mama, Mr. Corden brought me with him to the microphone for a not-at-all rehearsed performance of One Day More, from Les Misrables.Mr. Corden sang the role of Valjean and a helpful bartender provided the voices of Cosette and ponine while I, like a French revolutionary at the barricade, courageously fought my way through the parts of Marius and Javert. Several audience members generously applauded and no one walked out, as far as anyone could tell.On their way out of the piano bar, two exuberant patrons stopped at Mr. Cordens table to tell him that they would be watching the Tonys just to see what he does on the show.With a smile, Mr. Corden buoyantly replied: Lower your expectations. Lower your expectations."}
{"text": "CAIRO  Libyan fighters aligned with the United Nations-backed unity government on Thursday battled their way toward the center of Surt, the Islamic States coastal stronghold, in a rapid offensive that has confounded expectations and upended Western strategic calculations.Only a few months ago, American generals were touting a plan to dislodge the Islamic State from Surt with a campaign of airstrikes. Yet the three-week-old Libyan ground offensive, led by a brigade from the nearby city of Misurata, has gradually closed in from the west and south, capturing an airfield, military bases and a traffic junction where the Islamic State has hanged dozens of people.The swiftness and extent of these successes and the seeming inability of the Islamic State to hold on to territory has surprised observers inside and outside Libya.Clashes continued on Thursday as the Islamic State, whose force in the city is estimated to be in the low thousands, fought back with suicide bombings and sniper fire. Mohamed al-Ghassri, a spokesman for the Misuratan force, said 110 fighters from his side had been killed and more than 500 wounded since the operation started.Western officials and analysts cautioned that the Islamic State could yet mount counterattacks or guerrilla strikes. But many were impressed with the momentum of the assault, which comes as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, faces escalating pressure in Iraq and Syria. The assault also dealt a heavy blow to the Islamic States ambitions for a permanent base on the southern shores of the Mediterranean.The question now is whether ISIS will bunker down in the city center, or try to find a way out, said Mattia Toaldo, a Libya analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Videos circulating online showed jubilant Libyan fighters tearing down a metal frame, called the stage of horror, that the Islamic State used to hang at least 49 people. Fighters flashed victory signs as they sped around the citys outskirts, even as fighting continued.In Washington, American officials voiced guarded optimism.We welcome the advancement of G.N.A. forces against ISIL in Surt, and the coordination of the groups combating ISIL under the G.N.A.s authority, said Lt. Col. Michelle Baldanza, a Pentagon spokeswoman, referring to the Government of National Accord, or unity government. We are not going to predict timelines on Libyan military operations.Islamic State fighters began filtering into Surt in 2014, taking advantage of the factional chaos in Libya in the years after the downfall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. That vacuum eventually allowed the extremist group to control 150 miles of coastline and establish pockets of territory in a number of other cities. But now it controls no more than 40 miles of coast, and has been diminished elsewhere.A small contingent of American and British Special Operations forces are playing a background role in the assault on Surt. Mr. Ghassri, the spokesman for the Misuratan force, said that about 25 American and British soldiers were gathering intelligence and providing logistical information for the operation.The clashes on Thursday were concentrated around a conference hall known as the Ougadougou Center. The Libyans modest fleet of warplanes bombed the hall, where fighting continued on Thursday night. Yet the main part of Surt  a knot of tightly spaced streets where the former dictator, Colonel Qaddafi, was raised and, in 2011, killed  remains in the hands of the Islamic State.In Misurata, 110 miles to the west, hospitals said they had been overwhelmed by wounded soldiers, some of whom were flown to Italy and Turkey for treatment, Reuters reported. Suicide bombings had inflicted the heaviest casualties, in one instance killing 32 people, Mr. Ghassri said.Earlier this year, Pentagon officials estimated the Islamic States strength in Libya at up to 6,500 fighters, although other Western estimates run as low as 3,000. In a report on human rights violations in Surt published last month, Human Rights Watch cited a Libyan military intelligence official who estimated 1,800 fighters inside the city, 70 percent of whom were foreigners.Tunisians account for the majority of foreign fighters in Surt. Other recruits come from across North and West Africa, Syria and Afghanistan. The Human Rights Watch report detailed horrific scenes from everyday life, including public beheadings and floggings, that were said to have undermined support for the Islamic State among local residents.The military assault is good news for the unity government and the United Nations, which helped establish it. But in Libya, even good news can carry potential political risks. The unity government has failed to establish its authority since its arrival in the capital, Tripoli, in March. It has relied heavily on support from the United States and its European allies, which have imposed sanctions on opposing politicians, in an effort to bolster its standing.But some of the militias now fighting together have previously fought one another, raising fears about what would happen if they managed to capture Surt. The key thing is what happens the minute they put their flag on ground, said Mr. Toaldo, the analyst. Were talking about two forces that were fighting each other in the same area only one year ago."}
{"text": "At age 67, Thomas C. Davis should be enjoying all the perks of a long and distinguished career at the pinnacle of Wall Street and the Texas business elite. These include golfing at the prestigious Dallas Country Club and Preston Trail Golf Club, where he was a member; trips to Las Vegas and golf tournaments on the private jet he co-owned; and fractional ownership of two professional sports teams, the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Stars.What he faces instead is the prospect of 20 years or more in federal prison and millions of dollars in fines.Last month, Mr. Davis pleaded guilty to 12 felonies for a brazen insider trading scheme in which he leaked a stream of confidential information about the Dallas-based Dean Foods while he served as the companys chairman.When questioned by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 and lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, he lied, compounding his securities fraud by committing perjury. And after the F.B.I. agents left, he took a prepaid cellular phone he had used to leak the information and threw it into a creek near his Dallas home, destroying evidence and obstructing justice.Mr. Daviss crimes have received relatively little attention, in part because of the blaze of publicity that accompanied the flamboyant professional sports gambler William T. Walters, who was accused of being his co-conspirator, and the three-time Masters golf champion Phil Mickelson. (Mr. Mickelson wasnt charged but netted nearly $1 million from the Dean Foods tips and agreed to forfeit the proceeds plus interest.)Mr. Walters pleaded not guilty last week to 10 felony counts.What led to Mr. Daviss actions? His plea hearing, coupled with the S.E.C. and criminal complaints, and interviews with people who know him, offer some clues.For one thing, Mr. Davis was so desperate for money he even took from a charity. According to the S.E.C., Mr. Davis ran a charity that raised money for a Dallas shelter for battered women and children. The charity, tax records show, was Shelter Golf Inc., which held an annual one-day pro-am golf tournament at Preston Trail to benefit Genesis Womens Shelter & Support. The event typically raised over $400,000 and, after expenses, contributed about $300,000 a year to Genesis.Mr. Davis was a co-president and trustee of Shelter Golf; the golf legend Lanny Wadkins was one of five other trustees. According to the S.E.C., in August 2011, Mr. Davis told his assistant to write him a check for $100,000 on the charitys account, which he then used to cover an overdraft in his personal checking account of $80,000.This $100,000 check resulted in a significant shortfall in the amount available for donation to the battered womens shelter, the S.E.C. said in its complaint. Davis first delayed the charitys donation to the shelter and later wrote a check for a partial amount only after prompting by the shelter leader and promising another $100,000 by the end of the shelters fiscal year.Mr. Davis eventually repaid the $100,000 using money he had obtained as part of the insider trading scheme.Many of his former colleagues on Wall Street were stunned by the charges against the distinguished white-haired Mr. Davis, a Harvard Business School graduate and a Navy veteran, who, in contrast to Mr. Walters and Mr. Mickelson, both known gamblers, was seen as a pillar of the business establishment.In addition to his long tenure on the Dean Foods board, culminating in being named chairman in 2013, Mr. Davis served on at least nine other corporate boards, including Triton Energy, Suiza Foods, and the Dallas-based Colonial Bank (now owned by BB&T Financial). He was chief executive of the Concorde Group and a founder of Bluffview Capital, both investment firms.Before that, he was a managing partner at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where he was head of banking and corporate finance for the southwestern United States and handled many mergers and acquisitions. He left after Credit Suisse acquired the firm in 2001.As someone actively involved throughout his career in confidential deals, Mr. Davis would have been acutely aware of insider trading law. This was a shock, said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor and expert on insider trading at Columbia Law School who has written about the failure to charge Mr. Mickelson.He, of all people, should have known better.But the annals of insider trading are filled with people who knew better, from Ivan Boesky to Rajat Gupta. Whats perplexing is their motives. Like Mr. Davis, they were already rich and successful beyond most peoples dreams.At his plea hearing last month, Mr. Davis said he knew that his actions were wrong and unlawful but otherwise shed little light on why he turned to insider trading. But clearly, he needed money, despite his years of bonuses as a highly paid investment banker and his lucrative directors fees.According to the S.E.C.s complaint, by April 2010 Mr. Davis was in desperate financial straits. He owed the I.R.S. $78,000. His brokerage account was heavily margined, and he had run up tens of thousands in credit card debt. He owed $550,000 to one of his investment funds.Mr. Davis sought salvation in gambling and in Mr. Walters, whom he met decades earlier on a golf course. The two often played together, especially when they were both living in Southern California. The insider trading scheme began around June 2008, when Mr. Davis tipped Mr. Walters to Dean Foods coming earnings.It isnt clear who came up with the idea, but Mr. Walters, an active investor, often expressed an interest in how Dean Foods was doing. There was no explicit agreement for Mr. Davis to share in any proceeds from Mr. Walterss trading. Rather, as Mr. Davis put it at his plea hearing, I expected that I would receive personal benefits in the form of business opportunities and a potential source of capital.As Professor Coffee put it, This is a perfect example of a favor bank, which is exactly how Wall Street works.However vague the terms of their deal, they clearly knew that what they were doing was wrong. Mr. Walters gave Mr. Davis a prepaid cellular phone for use when conveying inside information and told him to use the code Dallas Cowboys when referring to Dean Foods, the government asserted.Mr. Davis finally came knocking in April 2010, when he met with Mr. Walters in Las Vegas and asked for money. Mr. Walters arranged a loan of $625,000, which solved the immediate demands of the I.R.S. and his investment firm.But his spending continued. In just one month, March 2011, Mr. Davis ran up gambling losses of $200,000 at one Las Vegas casino. He owed $178,000 for the private jet. And he had to cover the $100,000 he had taken from the charity. (The overdraft had occurred when the casino cashed in his markers after Mr. Davis failed to make good on the gambling losses.)This time Mr. Walters guaranteed a $400,000 line of credit for Mr. Davis, who promptly drew down $350,000 of it. And Mr. Davis repaid Mr. Walterss $625,000 loan, with interest.Mr. Davis ultimately received over $1 million in loans from Mr. Walters, most never repaid. As it turned out, that was a pittance compared to the $43 million in profit Mr. Walters reportedly reaped from Mr. Daviss tips  a sum Mr. Davis learned of only in the course of the investigation. Despite Mr. Daviss reputation as a skilled deal maker, that will surely rank as one of the worst insider trading deals in history, and it may help explain why Mr. Davis is now cooperating with the government against Mr. Walters.A lawyer for Mr. Davis, Thomas M. Melsheimer at Fish & Richardson in Dallas, declined to comment.The government has shed little light on Mr. Daviss motive, other than that he needed money. The S.E.C. said he did little to adjust his expensive lifestyle after leaving Credit Suisse in 2001. He experienced a sharp drop in his income, went through an expensive divorce soon after and suffered big investment reversals during the 2008 financial crisis.None of that is a crime. Mr. Davis is hardly alone in trying to maintain the illusion of wealth and prosperity even as his personal finances veered out of control.But after a lifetime of success, Mr. Davis was too proud and too embarrassed to admit any of this and turn to his wealthy friends and fellow golf club members, though many would have been willing to help, according to a person close to him. (This person and others insisted on anonymity because the situation involved a pending criminal matter.)Some people would risk anything rather than suffer that kind of personal embarrassment, Professor Coffee said. And once youve decided youre willing to risk anything, you can get into deep, deep trouble."}

When he and Eddie (Edgar Garcia), his brother-in-law and police buddy, are approached for help by French fashion executives  the designer Colette (Alice Taglioni) and her business associate Vincent (Frdric Anscombre)  they are invited to Paris to find a blackmailer threatening to flood the market with a counterfeit version of a Colette creation.Men will be boys, of course, and the assignment enables the arrested adolescent Luis and the laid-back Eddie to escape their better halves. (An appealing Rosario Dawson plays Luiss girlfriend, fed up with his chronic aversion to marriage, while Rosie Perez, as Eddies hotheaded wife, has an undimmed fiery sexiness.) In Paris, Luis and Eddie party with models, collide with Gallic mores and interview a parade of suspects (a publicist, a model, a photographer) while attired in comic disguises. Eddie resists the entreaties of Colette, and Luis hits on any beauty he can find.All the cast members (including Miriam Shor of The Good Wife in an all-too-brief comic turn) can handle this material in their sleep, and the longtime friends Mr. Guzmn and Mr. Garcia have an unforced chemistry. But the effective jokes land too rarely. Youll be ready to leave when the trip is over.Puerto Ricans in Paris is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity.

{"text": "Toyota said on Friday that it had instructed its dealers to disclose which of its new cars still use airbags that may deteriorate over time and become prone to violent ruptures. And the automaker said it had instructed dealers to tell potential buyers about the issue.Last week, a Senate report highlighted the continued use of defective Takata airbags in new models sold by at least four automakers: Toyota, Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler and Mitsubishi.Toyota and Fiat Chrysler had initially refused to name new models that contain airbags that are deemed especially risky, and will need to be recalled by 2018 under a plan laid out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Because the cars do not need to be recalled until then, automakers are technically not required to disclose that those cars contain the defective airbags.On Thursday, Toyota identified those models as the 2016 Toyota 4Runner midsize sport utility vehicle and the Lexus GX 460 in its luxury line. But on Friday, a company spokeswoman, Cindy Knight, said that Toyota dealers would disclose information about the defective airbag to potential buyers of those models.Toyotas 2015 model year Lexus IS 250C and 350C luxury cars, its Scion xB compact, and the 2015-2016 Lexus GX 460 and Toyota 4Runner models, which may still remain in dealer inventories, also contain the defective Takata airbags, the automaker said.At least 13 deaths worldwide have been linked to the defective airbags. The defect has also been linked to more than 100 injuries, many of them critical. Fourteen automakers are recalling more than 60 million vehicles to fix the defect in the biggest and most complex recall in automotive history.The interior of the bags is sensitive to moisture, and over time it can become prone to deploying violently and rupturing, sending shards of metal flying toward the cars occupants. The higher-risk airbags lack a drying agent that helps protect the interior from moisture.Regulators have emphasized, however, that the newer airbags do not pose an immediate threat, because it takes time for them to deteriorate.Chrysler has said just one new model contains the riskier airbag. On Friday, Eric Mayne, a company spokesman, again declined to disclose which model, and stressed that the cars were not yet under recall.Volkswagen earlier disclosed that its 2016 Volkswagen CC, and its Audi brands 2016 Audi TT and 2017 Audi R8 models contained the riskier Takata airbags. Mitsubishi said that the 2016 and 2017 model years of its i-MiEV electric vehicle contained the riskier airbags."}
{"text": "During the second quarter of what would eventually be a humbling 30-point loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, the first unanimous choice for most valuable player in N.B.A. history, found himself on the bench. He was not there to rest, or to recover from an injury, but simply because he was playing poorly and the team needed to try something else to compete.Warriors Coach Steve Kerr tried to cover for Curry after the game, saying he just had something he wanted to talk to Curry about, but Curry left no ambiguity as to the motivation for his benching, which was truly unusual for a player of his stature.I would have done the same thing, said Curry, who had 2 points and 3 fouls in the first half. He was trying to get us some life and figure out a way to get me going.Curry finished the game with an un-M.V.P.-like line of 19 points, 3 assists, 6 turnovers and 4 fouls. Other than a few brief moments in the second half, he barely made a dent against a relentless Cleveland defense.In a series in which LeBron James has nearly averaged a triple-double but was scrutinized after Game 2 for not taking over games more, Curry has yet to score 20 points in a game. He has had trouble hitting shots, trouble with fouls, trouble with turnovers and seemed positively human after a season in which he seemingly scored at will regardless of who was covering him or how far away he was from the basket.Kerr, who learned the power of brevity in his years with Coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, summed up the performance by saying, He didnt play well.In many ways, the struggles to make a dent in the finals go back to last season. Currys teams have won six of the nine games he has played in the finals over the last two seasons and, even with Wednesdays loss, the Warriors appear to be in the drivers seat for back-to-back titles with their two games to one lead. But Curry has yet to have a signature game. He has scored more than 30 points just once in the finals  a 37-point performance in Game 5 last season  and his two-year average of 22.7 points a game is more than 7 points a game lower than what he averaged per game this season.Curry acknowledged Clevelands effort, but personally took the blame for his performance in Game 3.Unfortunately, it was all me, Curry said. They were playing aggressive defense, and they came out with a big punch, and I didnt do anything about it or play my game. For me to do what I need to do to help my team, I have to play a hundred times better than I did.Many say the Curry era has eclipsed the James era. It will be interesting to see if the pressure James endures begins to surround Curry, not only to win games and titles, but also to provide jaw-dropping performances rather than just well-fought games in which his team wins with depth and strategy.That impossible standard was again imposed on James when Phil Jackson, the team president of the Knicks, said Monday that it was Jamess responsibility to get his team back into this series after bad losses in the first games of the series.Jackson made a reference to Michael Jordan leading the Chicago Bulls to a come-from-behind series victory over the Knicks in the 1993 Eastern Conference finals, saying the performance woke up something in Jordan.You learned something about pulling the cape of Superman, Jackson said. Its not a good idea. He was a man possessed after that. I think its going to take something for LeBron to step into that. Put his cape on and say, Im going to have to take over a lot of this series, doing the things beyond my level or my normal capacity.While James rejected the notion that he had to be like Jordan, or anyone else,, to help his team, he then went out and had a 32-point, 11-rebound, 6-assist game, throwing down several emphatic dunks, making several key shots and bringing an energy to his team that had been lacking since the Eastern Conference finals.Curry is capable of having a similar impact, as evidenced by his record-breaking 17-point overtime outburst in Game 4 of his teams second-round series against Portland. After Wednesdays game, he acknowledged that pressure was mounting for him to play to his capabilities heading into Friday.Theres a sense of urgency knowing how big Game 4 is, Curry said. I need to be ready."}
{"text": "For more than a decade, John Giuca has been fighting a verdict that declared him guilty of murdering a college student in 2003 at a party at his familys house in Brooklyn. But after several court hearings and the filing of numerous legal briefs, a judge on Thursday turned down his request for a new trial.Mr. Giuca, 32, was convicted in 2005 of killing Mark S. Fisher, a Fairfield University student whose body was found a few blocks from Mr. Giucas house in the Prospect Park South neighborhood. At a closely watched trial, prosecutors argued that Mr. Giuca was a member of a fledgling gang who had gone after Mr. Fisher to gain street credibility. They also said he had been jealous over a woman with whom Mr. Fisher was flirting and had been angry at him for drunkenly sitting on his parents table.From the moment of his conviction, Mr. Giuca and his family have tried to overturn it, occasionally through unconventional measures. After the trial, his mother, Doreen Giuliano, assumed a false identity and struck up friendships with the jurors, hoping to discover evidence of misconduct. More recently, his lawyer, Mark A. Bederow, filed papers claiming that a jailhouse informer who implicated Mr. Giuca had since recanted and that prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence.In his ruling, Justice Danny K. Chun said that while the informer, John Avito, had indeed changed his statement, the recantation should not be trusted because Mr. Avito had lied so often. Justice Chun also ruled that the prosecution had no obligation to obtain and disclose Mr. Avitos psychiatric records, which Mr. Bederow discovered only after the trial.Mr. Giuca showed no reaction as Justice Chun ordered him back to prison. But Ms. Giuliano refused to leave the courtroom, crouching on the floor and calling out, No! They took my son!Mr. Bederow told reporters he was disappointed but not discouraged by the ruling and promised to appeal."}
{"text": "How can movement be preserved in immobile form? This contradiction in terms has preoccupied artists for millenniums. (It obsesses choreographers and dancers too. Motion in stillness, stillness in motion has been a motto for dance forms as diverse as the ancient traditions of Southeast Asia and the avant-garde choreography of Merce Cunningham.)Three New York exhibitions catch a dancegoers eye for what they tell us of dancers and dance itself. In the Metropolitan Museums Pergamon and the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Ancient World  though it features a remarkable variety of dancers  movement is most hauntingly addressed in a small statue of a man identified as Alexander the Great.Hes not dancing; hes hunting. But energy, line and expression  prime dancerly virtues  all pour forth from him. In the past, he was identified as Meleager or Actaeon, mythological huntsmen. Recently, his facial features, downturned and not easy to discern, have led scholars to decide hes Alexander. (The sculptures date, probably between 250 and 100 B.C., is post-Alexander anyway.) Whoever he is, hes compelling. Hes caught in mid-action; you can feel what he was doing a moment ago and what will happen next.And he exemplifies something that preoccupies artists who depict dance: Hes different from every angle. Dance exists in three spatial dimensions (as well as the fourth dimension of time). When dancers move, they change before our eyes; when theyre captured in a single image, the artists eye often becomes drawn to multiplicity and complexity.Looking at this Alexander from his left, you notice how his left arm, descending from shoulder level, is braced. From neck to hand, the tension is marvelous. From this angle, youre also struck by his cloak, wrapped around his shoulders and left arm. Its final few inches are flying backward. Yet from his right side, that cloak is nearly invisible  hes otherwise nude  and now what dominates is his raised right arm.See him from the front, and it becomes plain how both his arms are involved in the same action, as if driving a spear. Now you observe, even if you cant see his face, how his head is determinedly focused on an unseen lower object. The angles of both elbows answer each other; the arms and shoulder describe a descending zigzag.From every angle you notice his stance, with the weight all on the right leg. One diagonal line ascends from his stretched left leg, through the spine to the neck; and, at a tangent, the right arm continues its upward slope. Every line here is purposeful. Theres none of the repose that characterizes the Greek ideal. This hunter is perfect, and perfectly caught, but his perfection is subordinated to action and intention.Many regular visitors to the Metropolitans permanent collection of ancient art will already know the Baker dancer (so called because it was donated by Walter C. Baker), said to come from Alexandria, Egypt. This exhibition, however, allows us the chance to walk around her. Like other dancers of her era (third or second century B.C.), shes veiled from head to toe, and masked. The sculpture is a masterpiece in its depiction of complex movement through fabric.Few depictions of dance have ever been so multidimensional, or so interestingly ambiguous about the nature of the dance involved. The tilting angle of the torso, the line of the advancing leg (its foot is just off the floor), the crook of one elbow, all add up variously as you circumnavigate her. From one angle she seems to be screening her averted face from view; from another angle she seems to protect her torso with that elbow, crooked like a prow. She has both repose and action, grace and mystery; what she shows and what she hides are equal parts of her beauty.How much variety the Hellenistic world contained! From early in the first century B.C. (lent from present-day Tunisia) comes a bronze statuette of a dancing dwarf. Like some other dancers in this exhibition, his weight is all on the right foot, and he creates a through-the-body line; but that line  sly, impish  is traced, not stretched. Whats striking are the heavy contours of his hips and thighs and the witty malice of his face: His eyes seems to gleam through the metal.The first picture you see on entering the Museum of Modern Arts Edgar Degas: A Strange New Beauty exhibition is a monotype of a ballerina on point beside an instructor: Its called Le Matre de Ballet (around 1876). Although the caption does not identify him, many viewers of Degass work will know the teacher as Jules Perrot  Europes greatest male dancer in the 1830s, its dominant choreographer in the 1840s and 1850s and an important ballet teacher in the 1870s.Degas seems to have been obsessed with Perrot for a while. This ballet master, gripping his tall stick even when sitting down, embodies both authority and inability: The young woman can do what he cannot, but he knows how she should do it.Although Degas is often, and rightly, considered an evocative realist, some of his ballet art has a touch of caricature. A naughty example here  Degass only depiction of a ballet jump that I know  is Pas Battu (around 1879), which has a touch of deliberate absurdity. The dancers shoulders seem hunched as she jumps; the angle of her legs in midair (parted, one bent) looks daft; the effortful grace of her arms (en couronne) seems comic. Degas is wickedly precise; you feel hes satirizing a leap that really did happen.Degass subjects are often labor, stress and exhaustion. Around this exhibition, his dancers, so often resting or preparing, take their place amid the many other working women he depicted  singers, laundresses, prostitutes. His tone seems to vary: It can be compassionate, dispassionate, tender, merciless.One of the most wonderful pictures, lent by the Cleveland Museum, is the Frieze of Dancers (an odd translation of the French Danseuses Attachant Leurs Sandales), an oil painting from around 1895. Four seated dancers are each tying the ribbons of their right point shoe (sandale); they are probably the same dancer from four different angles. The parted legs, bent knees, leaning torso, hidden face all ought to add up to an image of travail, yet the color and spirit turn this into an image of grace, beauty and charm.Amid the folk art collection of Elie and Viola Nadelman at the New-York Historical Society are Elie Nadelmans own sculptures of dancers and circus performers. Here are the painted, glazed, ceramic miniature originals of the two colossal statues that dominate the great upstairs foyer of the David H. Koch Theater.More fascinating, to a dancegoer, are the two high-kicking Dancer women he depicted in wood in 1920-24. Here modernity and primitivism meet, with a touch of humor. The crescent lines with which their lowered arms answer their upthrust legs are terrific, like the long, slanting curve of the two legs.What makes me smile is the way these women turn their head to look over their shoulders, away from the energy of those legs. Though these statues are small, they imply vastness. If the Koch contained these two danseuses instead of those seated pairs of women, you feel their energy would raise the roof."}
{"text": "BALTIMORE  Freddie Gray died after a rough ride in a police van, prosecutors here said on Thursday, laying out for the first time their murder case against the officer who drove the transport wagon in which Mr. Gray, a 25-year-old black man, suffered the diving-type injury that broke his neck and later killed him.With Mr. Gray shackled but not belted in the back of the van, Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. ran through a stop sign and took a sharp right turn, driving so fast that he did not stay in his lane, a prosecutor, Michael Schatzow, said. Had Officer Goodson buckled Mr. Gray, or called promptly for medical attention, he said, the young man would be alive today.He was injured because he got a rough ride, Mr. Schatzow told Judge Barry G. Williams of Baltimore City Circuit Court, adding: There was no good reason for the officer to repeatedly fail to seatbelt Mr. Gray except to bounce him around.It was the first time that prosecutors have used the words rough ride in connection with Mr. Gray  a compelling opener to a high-stakes trial playing out more than a year after the violent unrest set off by Mr. Grays death in April 2015. Experts said the rough ride argument would be difficult to prove, adding to the challenges faced by prosecutors, who have already tried two of the six officers facing charges in Mr. Grays death, and so far failed to win any convictions.Officer Goodson, 47, a department veteran, faces the most serious charges of any of the six, and is the only one who did not give investigators a statement. Thursday was the first time his story has been told; his defense lawyer, Andrew Graham, painted him as a decent man who acted in good faith. Mr. Graham told the judge that Mr. Gray caused his own death, by thrashing around in the van or trying to stand up as it was moving.An accident can be just an accident, Mr. Graham said, and the cause of the accident can be the person himself who was injured.At Officer Goodsons request, the case will be decided by Judge Williams, not a jury. Even before it got underway Thursday, it took a dramatic turn, as a furious Judge Williams berated Mr. Schatzow and his team for withholding evidence critical to the officers defense  information about prosecutors meeting in May 2015 with Donta Allen, a suspect who rode in the back of the van with Mr. Gray and is a potential witness in the case. Prosecutors said the meeting, their second with Mr. Allen, produced only silly information that was not relevant.The judge sharply disagreed, declaring the meeting extremely exculpatory. He ordered prosecutors to share any additional information that might be relevant by Monday morning, demanding:What else is out there that you havent turned over?Officer Goodson faces seven charges in all, including manslaughter and reckless endangerment, in addition to second degree depraved heart murder. Legal experts say it will be especially difficult for prosecutors to prove the murder charge, which will require them to show that the officer acted with willful indifference to Mr. Grays life.This is now about a rough ride, said Warren Alperstein, who frequently represents police officers, but is not involved in the Gray cases. He said much would depend on what evidence the state produces to prove its case: Is it going to be surveillance video? Is it going to be bystander witness testimony?Many details of the case are familiar by now.On April 12, 2015, Mr. Gray was walking with friends in the downtrodden Sandtown neighborhood of West Baltimore when he spotted a group of police officers and ran. They pursued, detained and arrested Mr. Gray, and Officer Goodson responded to the scene with a prisoner transport van. The officers eventually placed Mr. Gray, who was handcuffed and wore leg shackles, inside the van, but did not secure him with a seatbelt.One of those arresting officers, Edward M. Nero, was acquitted late last month of four misdemeanors in the case. The trial of another officer, William Porter, who arrived as backup, ended in a hung jury last year.With Officer Goodson at the wheel, the van made a total of six stops through West Baltimore. In court on Thursday, Mr. Schatzow said medical evidence would show that Mr. Gray was injured by hitting his head before the fourth stop, and that doctors could have saved him. But Mr. Graham said defense experts would testify that Mr. Grays injury happened later, was catastrophic, and that medical care would not have made a difference.Officer Porters testimony is expected to be crucial to the case against Officer Goodson, because he can tell the court what he and Officer Goodson discussed about Mr. Grays condition, and when.Whether Officer Goodson will testify in his own defense is unclear; defense lawyers have not said. But they did indicate on Thursday that they would call Mr. Allen, who rode in the van with Mr. Gray. He has said Mr. Gray was thrashing about in the back of the van  a remark that would seem to bolster the defense  but later recanted that statement in television interviews.The courtroom was packed for Thursdays opening arguments, with a crew of familiar faces who have been sitting through the trials. Among them was Tessa Hill-Aston, the president of Baltimores branch of the N.A.A.C.P., who said her organization often receives complaints of rough rides.She sounded pleased to hear the issue raised in court: Weve got to get some hits where someone is taking responsibility for Freddie Grays death."}
{"text": "If an 18-year-old can drive 200 miles per hour and win a race for a Formula One team, then why should anyone hesitate to put a teenager on soccers big stage?Max Verstappen was 18 years and 227 days old when he won the Spanish Grand Prix in May, in his debut with the Red Bull team. Marcus Rashford will be 18 years, 224 days old if he gets onto the field during Englands opening match in the European Championship on Saturday in Marseille, France, against Russia.Trusting youth is an old mans prerogative. Verstappen was put into the drivers seat by Helmut Marko, the 73-year-old head of Red Bulls driver development program. Also in May, Rashford made his debut with Englands national team after his selection by Manager Roy Hodgson, 68.Symbiosis between youth and experience is popular in sports today. Rashford is the youngest player at this Euro, but not by much.Portugals Renato Sanches is just a couple of months older than Rashford. The winger Emre Mor, also 18, has been called to Turkeys roster. Kingsley Coman (France) and Breel Embolo (Switzerland) are both 19, while Anthony Martial (France), Dele Alli (England), Jason Denayer (Belgium) and Julian Weigl and Leroy San (both Germany) are all 20.Some, like the calm defender Denayer, expect to start for their national team. Others will wait to be given game time. And among the English players  who by a good degree are the most precocious group ever picked for a big event  Rashford stands as the one who has already made the biggest mark.He made his debut for Manchester United on Feb. 25 against the Danish club F.C. Midtjylland in the Europa League. Rashford barely had time to get nervous  he was not expecting to play that game, until Martial, his teammate, strained a thigh muscle during warm-up.Rashford, a Manchester native who came up through the clubs academy system, scored with his first shot at Uniteds Old Trafford Stadium, otherwise known as the Theatre of Dreams.Two days later, Rashford scored against Arsenal in his Premier League debut. He kept up the habit, scoring against Uniteds crosstown rival, Manchester City, in his first derby game.As the weeks and months passed, Rashford maintained his place on Manchester Uniteds first team, even starting in the F.A. Cup final, and soon he began to be talked about as a prospect for the English national team.England is not short of decent strikers, with Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy right at the top of the scoring charts in a league that boasts players  especially attacking players  from virtually every nation in Europe and further afield.Hodgson threw Rashford into the lineup for a friendly against Australia on May 27. It took the teenager two touches to score. His first was a pass to Raheem Sterling to his left, and when Sterlings attempted return pass deflected into the air off a defender, Rashford timed his run perfectly. He volleyed from 12 yards, driving the ball sweetly into the goal. Less than three minutes into his national-team debut, Rashford had scored.He looks to be that rarest of creatures, a natural striker. Hodgson experimented with Rashford later in the game, playing him out wide to see how versatile the newcomer might be.After the game, Hodgson told reporters: Before tonight, you asked if I thought Marcus could be up for it, and was able to deal with the situation. I think we got a resounding yes. On that performance, he wouldnt look out of place in anybodys Euro squad.Rashford has joined some illustrative names in making his mark at such a young age. He is younger than Tommy Lawton or Jimmy Greaves were when they scored in their first starts for England. Both had recently turned 19 when Lawton scored in 1938 and Greaves in 1959. In addition, Rashford was the youngest to score for Manchester United in a European match since George Best, 51 years ago.He still has a lot of growing up to do, yet he shares this Euro with men at the other extreme when it comes to age: The Hungarian goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly turned 40 in April; the Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho is 38; Icelands Eidur Gudjohnsen is 37; and Swedens Zlatan Ibrahimovic is 34.Manchester United recently tore up Rashfords trainee contract for 78,000 pounds a year and replaced it with one worth 1.3 million a year, or about $1.9 million. (That is just for his salary. His mother and brother are negotiating separate sponsorship deals.)Meanwhile, he will be busy at the Euro. So, too, will Sanches, the stocky-but-quick, imaginative-yet-combative midfielder from Lisbon who, after just one season with Benficas first team, was sold to Bayern Munich for $40 million, a fee that could increase if he hits certain benchmarks for the German champion.That sum is just what it cost to acquire him. Sanches need not worry about salary  it has been negotiated by Jorge Mendes, the agent to Cristiano Ronaldo, Jos Mourinho and many others.Sanches is in the big leagues now with his new club, though well have to wait to see just how soon before Portugals coach, Fernando Santos, chooses to initiate him in the European Championship.The tall, lean and elegant Rashford and the bull-like Sanches look prepared to muscle it out with anyone at the tournament. But if they appear ready, the only way to find out is to play them. England, in particular, might figure it has little to lose. After all, it has been 50 years since the founding country of soccer won a major tournament, the 1966 World Cup.Holding on to experienced players has not exactly filled the English trophy cabinet. And there is evidence that playing them while young does no harm. Wayne Rooney, at 30 now Englands captain and its all-time leading scorer, started in an England shirt when he was 17 years, 317 days old. Michael Owen, now 36 and retired, scored probably his best goal when he was 18, against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup.As Owen ran and ran, evading the tackles almost like Lionel Messi, fans marveled at his youth. Whether it ever got any better than that, whether Owen became less instinctive and burdened by expectations as he matured  that is another matter.But there is a fearlessness about youth. Pel had it when he became the youngest scorer in World Cup history, scoring for Brazil in 1958 when he was 17 years and 239 days old.And whatever became of him?"}
{"text": "The Americas Cup races have yet to be held on fresh water. Even when Team Alinghi, from landlocked Switzerland, defended the Cup in 2007, it chose to hold the competition in Spain, on the Mediterranean Sea off Valencia.But the Americas Cup preliminaries will break the freshwater taboo when Chicago stages a Louis Vuitton World Series event on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.The racing, which will take place on Lake Michigan off Navy Pier, brings together the six teams entered in next years main event in Bermuda. They will compete in AC 45 foiling catamarans, a one-design version of the slightly larger boats that will be deployed for the Cup itself in 2017.Monohulls, long used in the venerable regatta that began in 1851, are generally faster in salt water, because it is more buoyant and therefore creates less displacement.Theres less hull to pull through the water, because the boat is floating a little bit higher, said Tod Reynolds, the event director for the Chicago World Series event.But foiling catamarans mostly sail above the surface of the water, with submerged carbon-fiber appendages providing the lift and requisite stability.With the foiling youre not so much worried about the displacement as viscosity, so its actually the drag over the foils that matters, and fresh water has less drag than salt water over the foils, Reynolds said. So if we get a good wind direction and a good windy day in Chicago, I think theres a good chance well see speed records set in these boats.The competitors themselves are not so clear on the repercussions. Matt Cassidy was based in Chicago for several years before joining the crew of the Americas Cup defender, Oracle Team USA, in 2015. He has raced often on Lake Michigan.I honestly dont think its going to be that big of a change between salt and fresh water, Cassidy said by telephone from Bermuda last week. I keep telling everyone the biggest thing is youre not going to have to spray all the salt off the boat at the end of the day and wash everything down. Our takeoff speeds might be a little faster, but I honestly dont think its going to be a huge change for us.Two things the teams wont have to worry about on Lake Michigan are ocean tides and river currents. They raced in a world series event in New York last month in the brackish water of the Hudson River off lower Manhattan. They had trouble with the current and with the wind consistency because of the effects created by the tall buildings along both banks.Chicago has an imposing skyline, too, but only on one side of the course, and the skyscrapers are farther from the water.That actually goes back to the Chicago fire, Reynolds said, referring to the 1871 fire. The entire lakefront of Chicago is public land, so its all parks. What that means is that the racecourse is about a mile away from the first building, so we will still have time for the breeze to kind of reconnect as it comes through the city. But the reality is we are in a city, so if the breeze does come right through the city, its going to be shifty.But though we have never run races in flying multihulls, weve run a lot in multihulls in this venue, he added, and while it is really shifty, its not quite as random because the current adds a massive impact where as soon as you lose breeze a little bit, the boat almost stops. Whereas the flat water and the lack of current on the lake allows you to kind of coast a little bit farther and connect the puffs a bit easier.That should come as a relief to Ben Ainslie, the star British sailor who wrote a piece in The Daily Telegraph in Britain after the New York event praising the crowd turnout but stating that the race itself was held in the last place on earth you would want to put a race course.Russell Coutts, the former star skipper who is now chief executive of the Americas Cup Event Authority, said in a telephone interview that he was confident that if the races returned to New York, the authorities would allow them to use a more propitious spot in the harbor.But he also pointed out in response to Ainslies newspaper commentary that the same teams that have been leading the way  Emirates Team New Zealand and Oracle Team USA  were still on top, even in fluky conditions. Ben was obviously disappointed about his result, Coutts said. But look at the results, and look at the results of the season.This could have been Chicagos Olympic year. It bid for the 2016 Summer Games that were instead awarded to Rio de Janeiro. Knowing what the International Olympic Committee members know now about Rios and Brazils political and socioeconomic difficulties, the members might have voted differently.But Reynolds said he and others in Chicago still hoped that the city would some day lure the Americas Cup itself. Chicago has a significant sailing culture, and the Chicago Yacht Club even backed skipper Buddy Melges and the Heart of America challenge for the Americas Cup in 1987 in Fremantle, Australia. As part of that challenge, lawyers somehow successfully argued to the New York Supreme Court that Lake Michigan was an arm of the sea because of its link to the St. Lawrence Seaway and thus satisfied the requirements in the deed of gift to potentially host the Americas Cup.The city also made a serious bid to host the 2017 edition of the Cup. It went instead to Bermuda, which offered a more attractive financial package and space for team bases in the two years leading into the Cup.Our goal is that this world-series event would be a steppingstone to the finals should the stars align, and obviously a lot of stars have to align, Reynolds said. I mean, how perfect would it be to have the teams be able to use the existing infrastructure in Bermuda, be based there, train there just as they are doing now, and then have the finals in a city where its easy for fans to get to, sponsors are able to activate, and you have our signature skyline in the background."}
{"text": "Tesla Motors, the maverick electric-car maker, is under scrutiny from federal regulators over suspension failures attributed to its biggest-selling model  along with reports that it had asked owners not to disclose the problem.The nations top auto safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said on Thursday that at least some Tesla customers who experienced suspension failures with Model S luxury cars were asked to sign confidentiality agreements about the issue.The agency immediately informed Tesla that any language implying that consumers should not contact the agency regarding safety concerns is unacceptable, and N.H.T.S.A. expects Tesla to eliminate any such language, said Bryan Thomas, an agency spokesman. Tesla representatives told N.H.T.S.A. that it was not their intention to dissuade consumers from contacting the agency.The regulator added that the agreements that Tesla required were troublesome.Tesla did not respond Thursday to requests for comment. [On Friday, the company responded in a blog post, saying there was no safety defect with the Model S nor any intent to discourage complaints to regulators.]The safety regulator is examining the Model S suspension  the springs, joints and other components that connect a car to its wheels  for possible defects that could be causing premature failures.Since October, it has received 33 complaints of suspension parts breaking. A suspension breakdown can cause severe steering problems and make driving impossible, according to filings listed on the agencys website.A few of the complaints pertained to a requirement that owners sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for having their cars repaired. The suspension problems and the issue of the nondisclosure agreements have also been discussed on blogs for Tesla owners.The company reported that in 2015, it sold 25,200 Model S cars, which have a starting price of about $70,000.Tesla has just started offering a sport utility vehicle, the Model X, and is planning to offer a compact car, the Model 3, next year. The company hopes the Model 3 will become its top seller and says it has already received $1,000 deposits from about 375,000 potential buyers.The suspension issue with the Model S is the latest sign of quality concerns. The Model X S.U.V. was recalled earlier this year because of a problem with its rear seats.Teslas first model, the two-seat Roadster, which was produced from 2008 to 2011, also had its problems.At Teslas annual shareholder meeting last month, Elon Musk, the companys chief executive, acknowledged that the Roadster had been plagued by a number of issues.This car, even though it met all regulatory requirements, it was completely unsafe, broke down all the time and really didnt work, Mr. Musk said.Two years ago, the safety administration looked into two instances in which Model S cars caught fire. It determined that the fires were caused by road debris striking the vehicles underside, and closed the matter after Tesla agreed to reinforce the shield that protects the battery.For most of its 13-year history, Tesla has tried to break away from many standard auto industry practices, a strategy that at times courts controversy. Its practice of selling its cars online without dealers has led to court battles in several states. The company is also building a gigantic battery factory in Nevada and often announces news via tweets by Mr. Musk.Everything they do, they try to do differently than the traditional auto company, but they all have to deal with the same rules, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.Ms. Krebs said she had never heard of a car company requiring customers to sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for repairs of potential safety defects. It does raise eyebrows, she said. It may have happened before. Ive just never seen it.In its statement about the inquiry, the N.H.T.S.A. did not elaborate on the extent or details of Teslas use of nondisclosure agreements. But according to accounts posted online, some customers who complained about suspension problems had their cars fixed on the condition that they agreed in writing not to talk about the issue or how the company dealt with it.An auto industry blog, dailykanban.com, posted what it said were excerpts from the agreement, along with a scanned copy. You agree to keep confidential our provision of the Goodwill, the terms of this agreement and the incidents or claims leading or related to our provision of the Goodwill, the document said. Goodwill is the term Tesla used to refer to any repairs or compensation it made because of a suspension failure.The agreement posted on the blog released Tesla from any liability and barred the car owners from filing legal proceedings against the company."}
{"text": "In the 1950s, California corporate executives wrapped suburban banks in murals and mosaics to attract customers. The walls, meant to signify prosperity, were patterned with glittering city skylines, flourishing orange groves and portraits of Hollywood stars and early California missionaries. The best-known designer of the works, Millard Sheets, recalled in a 1988 interview that when bank patrons were asked what appealed to them about the buildings, they replied, We like to be associated with something beautiful.Adam Arenson, director of the urban studies program at Manhattan College, has spent six years documenting the banks, mostly part of the Home Savings and Loan chain, along with other public artworks by Mr. Sheets. Mr. Arensons book, Millard Sheets and Home Savings: Mid-Century Modern Corporate Art and Urban Identity for Southern California and Beyond, is due next year.The projects of Mr. Sheets, who died in 1989, are scattered from Honolulu to Detroit and Boston. Mr. Arenson keeps hearing about discoveries from people who are researching them and protecting them from demolition.He has been admiring the work since he was a child; he grew up in San Diego, near a Home Savings branch with a Sheets scene of California friars and vaqueros. The imagery, he said, has this sense of myth and identity and region.Mr. Sheets, a native of Pomona, Calif., was tireless, traveling widely to paint scenes of Africa, Asia, the South Pacific and the Middle East. At his studio in Claremont, Calif., he supervised teams of designers to produce mosaics, murals, stained glass, sculpture and fountains.Along with banks, the studio created works for restaurants, churches, hotels, airports, libraries, stores, government agencies, schools, hospitals, Freemasons and cemeteries. The varied mosaics and murals sometimes measure over 100 feet long. At the University of Notre Dame, a librarys exterior wall is filled with a stone mosaic of Christ reaching upward with arms in a U-shape; although its official title is Word of Life, it is widely known as Touchdown Jesus.Mr. Sheets also designed calendars and movie sets, and he collaborated and socialized with celebrities like Walt Disney and the abstract artist Hans Hofmann. Still, Mr. Sheetss output has not much interested art historians. It is often considered art of the establishment rather than avant-garde, Mr. Arenson said.Mr. Sheets and his wife, Mary, raised four children. One of their three sons, the artist Tony Sheets, runs a website, millardsheetsart.com, and tracks his fathers artworks. When murals and mosaics are endangered, he helps transfer them to new homes.We keep a close eye on them, he said.Gilded mosaics of birds and deities from a Dallas bank have been moved to the Joule hotel in Dallas. (Other mosaics from the bank have sold for thousands of dollars each.) A tableau of industrial workers made for a Los Angeles department store was taken to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Paintings of California hills from a Hollywood homes dining room have been hung at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif. A mural of a 19th-century parade, painted on walnut panels, has been transferred from a Pasadena bank to the gym at Pasadena City College.Mr. Arenson is still determining the fate of some Sheets works, including an abstract mosaic in fiery colors that filled a lobby wall at the former headquarters of Interpace, a ceramics manufacturer in Parsippany, N.J. It is no longer visible, and no information has emerged about when it was taken out or covered up. The original drawing for the project is priced at $5,000 at Alan Wofsy Fine Arts gallery in San Francisco, which has a large inventory of Sheets sketches, paintings and prints.Paul Bockhorst Productions in Monrovia, Calif., released a documentary a year ago, Design for Modern Living: Millard Sheets and the Claremont Art Community 1935-1975. A sequel in progress, Claremont Modern: The Convergence of Art + Architecture at Midcentury, will explore Mr. Sheetss contributions to Home Savings branches.The painter Anna Mary Robertson Moses, known as Grandma Moses, became a celebrity in the 1940s, soon after her 80th birthday. She prolifically painted her memories of 19th-century New York and Vermont towns and farmsteads, and she sometimes incorporated forms copied from magazines, books, greeting cards and prints. With her Manhattan dealer, Otto Kallir at the Galerie St. Etienne, she licensed her nostalgic works to be reproduced on textiles, tiles and dinnerware.Prominent critics dismissed her paintings as kitsch, although other art world luminaries of her time, including Elie Nadelman, Andy Warhol and Joseph Cornell, similarly borrowed from 19th-century imagery. In the catalog for an exhibition, Grandma Moses: American Modern, which opens June 18 at the Shelburne Museum in Vermont, the curator Jamie Franklin writes, I simply find it astounding how resonant Mosess practices were with larger trends in the art world, and how little it has been commented upon.Mr. Franklin is the curator at the Bennington Museum in Vermont, which owns about 40 of Grandma Mosess paintings as well as her art supplies, needlework fabrics, the schoolhouse that she attended as a child and her 18th-century worktable covered in landscape paintings. (The Shelburne exhibition will travel to the Bennington Museum next year.)Jane Kallir, an owner of Galerie St. Etienne, said that a complete catalog of Grandma Mosess works is in progress. Pieces are still surfacing; in April, two Moses landscapes, one painted on Masonite and another on a ceramic pitcher, sold together for $15,000 at Doyle auction house in Manhattan. She had told the original owner how the idea for the Masonite panel came to her: One morning I dreamed I saw this scene and got up and painted it before the vision of it faded."}
{"text": "GOODNIGHT, BEAUTIFUL WOMENStoriesBy Anna Noyes216 pp. Grove Press. $24.In the eleven stories of Anna Noyess artful debut collection, Goodnight, Beautiful Women, women and girls, living in a coastal New England environment of some harshness, confront the bleak realities of their lives: the unreliability of those they love and depend on, the hurt and confusion of sexual molestation, the desperation of poverty, the sorrow of loss. A woman struggles to understand what happened to her husband, a sculptor gone mad, who has drowned himself in a nearby quarry. An unexpectedly pregnant young woman finds comfort and guidance in her boyfriends dying mother. Another young woman atones for a childhood lie  blaming a cousin with Down syndrome for sexual abuse committed by someone else  by spending every Sunday of her adult life with the cousin.The stories may sound grim, but they consistently sparkle with expressive detail. In the title story, a teenager home from boarding school joins her ill mother and her mothers longtime boyfriend, a good-hearted but parochial man, on a road trip that leads to her mothers sudden abandonment of him. The teenagers last image of this man, a father figure who taught her how to wash dishes and tie her shoes, is of him standing outside the gas station store, holding the two cups of hot chocolate he just purchased for her and her mother, his hair blowing like seeds from a kicked dandelion.In Safe as Houses, the physical rawness of a young teenagers wisdom teeth being pulled presages her first sexual encounter. The recent attempted attack on a local girl adds to the foreboding atmosphere. Early in the story, the protagonists father, a widower, accompanies the teenager to the dentist. In a rare shift to a male point of view, Noyes takes us into the fathers mind. Having endured the illness and death of his wife  Her face grew old when she was still young, and her breath turned sour from too much sleep  he knows to expect of the bloody dental procedure that all of it, even the most vulgar details, would come home to his heart. With sympathy and skill, Noyes captures the ordeal of his past as he recalls changing the sheets of his wifes deathbed: Only after she died did grace shake loose, the twisted sheet stripped from her bed, the fresh one filling like a sail before settling smooth.Noyess knack for lucid prose includes providing her characters with simple language that nevertheless grasps an understanding of complex human dynamics. In Treelaw, a young woman sums up the difference between the relatively straightforward love of her boyfriend and that of her sexually abusive father: Drill looked at me like hed known me forever, and Dad looked at me like I was a stranger sneaking through the room. An aged widow in Drawing Blood pinpoints her capacity to endure a long marriage to a man who should have been sickening to the moment when, still a newlywed, she turned from hating him to needing him, a surprising shift stirred by his ability to quicken something inside her that could not be slowed.While the characters in Goodnight, Beautiful Women suffer no shortage of hardship, and are often as much participants in their own downfall as they are victims of it, they are full of an honesty they cant hide. As one woman remarks to another: I see big news all over your face."}
{"text": "BAGHDAD  Two suicide attacks in and around the Iraqi capital on Thursday killed at least 31 people and wounded dozens, officials said.The deadliest attack took place in a commercial area of a majority Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad. At least 19 civilians were killed and 46 wounded, the police said.Another suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into an Iraqi Army checkpoint in the town of Taji, north of the capital, killing at least 12 and wounding 32, a police officer said. The attack killed seven civilians and five soldiers, the officer said.In an online statement, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in the capital, in the New Baghdad neighborhood, saying it had targeted Shiite militia members. The group later claimed responsibility for the bombing in Taji, about 12 miles north of Baghdad, in a second online statement, saying it was targeting the Iraqi Army.The authenticity of the statements could not immediately be verified, but they were posted on a militant website commonly used by the extremists.The Islamic State, a Sunni group, often targets Iraqs Shiite majority, its security forces and government officials. Baghdad has seen near-daily attacks in recent weeks.The deadly attacks in the capital area are seen by Iraqi officials as an attempt by the militants to distract the security forces attention from the front lines. The attacks came a day after Iraqi special forces pushed into the city of Falluja, held by the Islamic State, in a large-scale military operation started last month.Falluja, about 40 miles west of Baghdad, is one of the last major Islamic State strongholds in western Iraq. The extremist group still controls territory in the countrys north and west, as well as Mosul, Iraqs second-largest city."}

{"text": "SMOKEBy Dan Vyleta431 pp. Doubleday. $27.95.As he was creating Middle-earth, J.R.R. Tolkien often read passages of his work-in-progress to the Inklings, the amiable Oxford literary group that included C.S. Lewis. Once, the story goes, Tolkien got up and began to read a fresh chapter. In the back of the room, a third Inkling, Hugo Dyson, muttered, with deeply forgivable despair, a comment containing a profanity: Oh no. Not another ... elf.Its a funny anecdote. But an illuminating one, too, because of course its Tolkiens very obsessiveness that makes him great. Theres a certain kind of fantasy novel that feels tinkered over, far past the point of usefulness, to such a degree that the authors preoccupation with his special world supersedes, in an odd way, the book for which it was invented  the book becoming only an artifact of the process, an externality, rather than its endpoint. You can see that in the volumes that follow the masterpieces: for instance The Silmarillion, Tolkiens unreadable late addendum to The Lord of the Rings, or The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories, a collection of scraps that lingers without much purpose in the universe of Susanna Clarkes wonderful Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Neither writer was ready to depart an alternative reality merely because the story that inspired it had finished.From a step back, even great novels of this type can seem silly. Another elf! But because their authors have imagined them so specifically and fully, the best ones have a peculiar, thrilling, impossible-to-fake actualness. Hogwarts, Islandia, Earthsea: You can go there, really go there, and so, for a while, stop being here. No wonder teenagers fall for them hardest.For about a hundred pages, Smoke, a new magical-historical novel by Dan Vyleta, offers this sort of rare immersion. In its superb opening, the boys at an English boarding school  never named, but with a convincing resemblance to Eton  assemble in the bathrooms for a late-night tribunal. The time is roughly Edwardian. Julius, a refined, aristocratic bully, randomly selects a succession of individuals to be interrogated in front of the gathering, as two friends watch, terrified that one of them might be called next. Charlie is open, kind and well born; Thomas is darker, sharper and bears the wounds of a complex family history. Still, neither has anything definite to hide. Theyre only scared to be questioned because it might make them smoke.This smoke is the conceit of Vyletas novel, the single radical difference between its reality and ours. When humans in Smoke lie or become angry or feel passion, they begin to emit this visible evidence of their emotions. Among the upper classes, smoking is disgraceful  hence the self-policing of the boys  while the lower classes smoke almost continually. Burghers may smoke, once in a while, the author adds in a typically wry, enlivening aside. One does not expect better of them.Soon, though, Thomas and Charlie begin to wonder about the real nature of smoke, stumbling first upon a finely imagined sequence of small puzzles  theres a particular kind of hard candy that may have something to do with it, a particular kind of cigarette too  and then upon the obligatory big secret, which concerns the true origins of the stuff. It turns out there are sides involved, and beliefs. Eventually, the boys get close enough to the truth that theyre forced to go on the run, seeking safety and answers. Its the increasingly unbalanced Julius who sets out to chase them down.Vyleta is a skilled, inventive writer, and his idea here is inspired; in its initial burst of creative energy, Smoke is headily like the fiction of David Mitchell or Michel Faber. Unfortunately, the novels strong premise is betrayed almost immediately by problems of both storytelling and world-building, which are first distracting, then grave and finally fatal.The plot is the more serious of Vyletas difficulties. It seems badly underthought  too compressed in time, inexcusably dependent on contrivance and coincidence  and its intricate strands, tracking smokeless savages and hidden shipboard compartments and mad schoolmasters, never really cohere. Instead, Vyleta bluffs his way out of them, usually by pondering the smoke, into which he pours so much meaning that it eventually becomes meaningless. By the end of the book, its everything: Yearning. Courage. Anger. ... Defiance. Triumph. Hope. Its the animal part of us that will not serve. This is exactly the brand of sophistry that also diminished long stretches of the trilogy that is, with its enchanted dust, perhaps a model here, Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials.By contrast, Tolkiens interest in his characters is almost always local. He might have had nuclear annihilation on his mind, but his books have a profound solidity of specification, to use Henry Jamess phrase, the crucial sense that their author knew what berries were growing on every plant Frodo passed. Vyleta is talented enough to fill Smoke with plenty of good scenes and good writing, all the way through. But his novel never attains its own reality. Instead, it has the quality of a first draft, trying to make it all the way home off the initial propulsion of an exciting concept. It doesnt have that slight madness of commitment that distinguishes the strongest books in its genre, the thing that will drive so many of us to stand gratefully in line for the new, no doubt wholly gratuitous Harry Potter sequel when it comes out later this year."}
{"text": "For years, Fernando Lopezs storefront money-transfer business in Atlantic City was a place where local residents could wire money to family and friends abroad. But that business, Interamericana Express, which handled a lot of transmittals to Mexico, is dwindling as banks and regulators take a stricter view of cross-border money transfers.Mr. Lopezs business accounts have been closed several times in recent years by three different banks over money-laundering concerns despite his state license, hours of compliance training and binders full of rules and regulations. Since being dropped by the banks, he has operated his money-transfer business as an agent of MoneyGram International and Ria Money Transfer, depositing transfers in accounts at those companies. Banks will not take any of his money-transfer business directly.Frustrated, he is trying to convert his shop, which also offers notary and bill payment services, into a by-the-pound parcel shipping center. The banks dont see a small business with a money-transfer operation in a good way, Mr. Lopez said.We comply with all the regulations. We have to follow the rules, he said. But they dont want to deal with us.Mexico is the biggest destination for money transfers from the United States, according to estimates by the World Bank. About $24.3 billion was remitted there from the United States last year, practically all of the cross-border money that flowed to Mexico from around the world, and nearly one-fifth of all remittances sent abroad from the United States. But what was once viewed as a big consumer business opportunity for American banks is now seen as a liability.Banks are refusing to do business with money transmitters, closing or freezing their accounts over concerns about money laundering and extra regulatory scrutiny.The affected businesses include mom-and-pop convenience stores such as Mr. Lopezs, potentially limiting options for the millions of people living in the United States who want to send money home or forcing them to send cash, which is risky. Over one-quarter of American households rely on nonbank financial institutions, including money transmitters, for everyday banking needs, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.Large banks are just walking away from the business completely, said Peter Ohser, an executive vice president of MoneyGram International in Dallas, one of the two biggest transmitters next to Western Union.Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase scrapped their own low-cost remittance services two years ago. And last year, Citigroup agreed to pay $140 million to regulators for failing to safeguard against money laundering. It shut down its Banamex USA unit, with $500 million in assets and branches in Arizona, California and Texas, some 14 years after Citi bought the Mexico City-based Banamex as an opportunity to serve the needs of Hispanic families living on either side of the border.AmeriMex Communications, a Roswell, Ga., company that sells cellphone minutes to people in the United States to give to family or friends in Mexico, has started to work with some convenience store owners on a prepay basis because many are also money-transfer agents and their bank accounts have been frozen, according to Don Aldridge, the chief executive of AmeriMex.Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash. Because it is nearly impossible for banks to know the identity of the final customer in a money transfer, remittance companies and their agents are being categorized as a high risk for money laundering and denied banking services. We are part of the collateral damage, Mr. Aldridge said.He added he had considered buying three convenience stores in the Atlanta area and getting a money-transferring license, but he was told by his bank  First Citizens Bank in Raleigh, N.C.  that it would no longer be able to work with him if the stores were transferring money abroad.A spokeswoman for First Citizens Bank, Barbara Thompson, said that she was not aware of Mr. Aldridges experience and that the bank did provide services to money-transfer companies that were registered with state and federal authorities.Wells Fargo is one bank that still offers services to money-transfer companies and their agents who send money from the United States to Mexico. But the bank provides such services only to companies or agents with which it has a relationship, and it puts them through tougher checks than it does with other customers, a bank spokesman said.A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment. JPMorgan and Citigroup did not respond to questions about their policy toward money-transfer companies and agents.Regulators are aware of the problems that money transmitters are facing; they say the situation is part of a wider trend of banks closing potentially risky accounts because of the costs of monitoring and compliance.Among other factors, accounts may be dropped for very legitimate reasons, including suspicions of illicit activity or account holders not having the appropriate controls in place, said Daniel L. Glaser, assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. The fact that, over the same time period, the overall level of U.S.-to-Mexico remittances appears to be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants  which would not be a bad thing.As of the end of March, state financial regulators licensed 456 money transmitters, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year, though licenses for companies that operate in multiple states  larger than just a one-store operation  rose 16.6 percent, according to a report by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.Though the dollar amount of transfers has been rising steadily since the financial crisis, the data reflects the health of the economy and the strength of the dollar, rather than the health of the money-transfer market, experts said.What you dont see behind the scenes is that prices are going up, said Mr. Ohser of MoneyGram. A lack of banks willing to provide account services to any business that is transferring money to Mexico is causing friction and leading to increased costs, Mr. Ohser said.Regulators say they are growing concerned that people will resort to sending cash across the border, which is harder to track and riskier. Money transmitters going out of business could lead remittance senders to use informal methods that are less detectable, according to a Government Accountability Office report published in January this year.Armored cars and courier services taking currency across the border have drawn the attention of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, which last year began investigating an increase in suspicious dollar currency shipments. FinCen investigators, along with Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have since tightened monitoring of border cash transit.The Treasury Department is working closely with Mexican authorities to address the difficulties that money-service businesses on both sides of the border are facing, Mr. Glaser said. Its a priority for us that remittance channels remain open.Various international organizations are also working on efforts to help the money-transfer industry get access to banks. The Financial Stability Board in Switzerland has been coordinating those efforts, since noting that the trend of banks withdrawing services to other banks  known as correspondent banking  has the potential to rise to a systemic issue.Opinions are not changing quickly enough for people like Mr. Lopez, however. He worries his accounts at Ria and MoneyGram could be closed, too. That would be devastating, he said. Thats the reason Im trying to expand my shipping business. Its like Plan B."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Two weeks before the annual dog meat festival in the southern Chinese city of Yulin, an international coalition of animal welfare advocates is stepping up pressure on the Chinese government to shut it down.A petition with more than 11 million signatures was presented to the Chinese Embassy in London on Tuesday, according to Humane Society International, one of the organizations behind the campaign.Representatives of the group, which is based in Washington, along with Chinese animal rights advocates, also delivered the petition on Friday to the Beijing office of the government of Yulin, where the Lychee and Dog Meat Festival has taken place on the summer solstice since 2010 amid mounting controversy. Copies of the petition were being sent by registered mail to Chinese health and food safety regulators, according to Peter J. Li, a China policy adviser to Humane Society International.Thousands of dogs are slaughtered and served in restaurants in Yulin, in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, for the festival, which is set to begin on June 21. Its proponents defend the practice as an expression of cultural heritage and argue that eating dogs is no different from eating cows or turkeys.But images of dogs being beaten and gutted in Yulin marketplaces have ignited outrage around the world, as celebrities and politicians throw their support behind efforts to stop the festival. In China, where dogs are increasingly viewed as companions, not food, animal welfare advocates have raised questions about the sources of the dogs, charging that many are stolen pets.A commentary on Monday in Peoples Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, by Chang Jiwen, a legal scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and two of his students, Liu Kai and Guo Shunzhen, cited results of a survey posted on the website of CCTV, Chinas national broadcaster, where 64 percent of respondents agreed that eating dogs should be banned.In an email, Mr. Li said that he expected millions more to join the global call by June 21, and that China will score a huge reputation-improvement score if its government shut down the event.The petition on the website of Humane Society International addresses President Xi Jinping, saying that by ending the festival, you will clearly show your leadership in protecting the well-being of both people and animals, and demonstrate that Chinas global reputation as a progressive nation will not be besmirched by such activities.The animal welfare groups Raise UR Paw and Duo Duo, as well as Care2 and Avaaz, have also posted the petition.The effort to end the Yulin festival has extended as far as the United States Congress. Last month, Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, introduced a resolution condemning the festival and urging China to enforce its food safety regulations and enact laws banning animal cruelty.The protests, and shifting attitudes in China, appear to have had some effect. In 2014, the Yulin government distanced itself from the festival, saying it was staged by private business people and did not have official backing.The slaughter frenzy went down in 2013, 2014 and further down in 2015, said Mr. Li, based on his visits to the city over the years. The dog meat industry in Yulin and in the entire country is shrinking."}
{"text": "FRANKFURT  German prosecutors said Thursday that they were investigating whether a Volkswagen manager encouraged employees to destroy or remove documents last year, shortly before the Environmental Protection Agency publicly accused the carmaker of illegally manipulating emissions tests in the United States.Volkswagen employees have told investigators that a person in a supervisory position sent clear signals in August 2015 that they should remove evidence. While the person wasnt explicit, everyone understood, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the states attorney in Braunschweig, GermanyThe investigation, previously reported by several German news organizations, could raise the stakes for Volkswagen, which is already under intense scrutiny by authorities in the United States, Germany and other countries.The E.P.A. formally accused Volkswagen of clean air violations on Sept. 18, 2015. The company has maintained in court documents that top executives of the company did not grasp the gravity of the accusations until shortly before the E.P.A. announcement.If a VW manager was signaling employees to remove documents in August, it suggests that at least some people in supervisory positions were aware of the possible grave repercussions. Mr. Ziehe said that employees transferred some electronic documents to thumb drives, which have been recovered, and that prosecutors do not believe that much, if any, information was lost.Prosecutors did not disclose the name of the German suspect or his job description, in line with German privacy laws. A person close to the carmaker, who declined to be named because of the continuing investigation, said the suspect was a member of Volkswagens legal staff and has been suspended from his job.It is not the first time Volkswagen has faced accusations that employees tried to impede investigations into widespread cheating on diesel emissions tests.In March, a former Volkswagen employee filed a whistle-blower lawsuit in Michigan, asserting that co-workers illegally deleted electronic data shortly after the United States government accused the carmaker of cheating on emissions tests. The former employee, Daniel Donovan, says he was fired from his job as an information manager at a Volkswagen facility in Auburn Hills, Mich., because his superiors believed that he was about to report the company to the authorities for obstruction of justice.Mr. Ziehe said he did not know whether there was any connection between the Braunschweig investigation, which focuses on a Volkswagen employee based in Germany, and the alleged destruction of data in the United States reported by Mr. Donovan.Prosecutors have said they have identified 17 suspects in a wider investigation into who was responsible for installing software in 11 million diesel vehicles that was designed to mislead regulators about the cars emissions of poisonous nitrogen oxide.The prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagens headquarters in Wolfsburg, have not filed formal charges against any of the suspects. Mr. Ziehe said it would most likely be several more months before prosecutors determined if they had enough evidence to make arrests.The investigation of the VW manager was earlier reported by the German broadcasters NDR and WDR and the Sddeutsche Zeitung in Munich, who worked together on the story."}
{"text": "MOSCOW  Communist party chief Leonid L. Brezhnev told Soviet voters today [June 10] their country was taking new measures and making new efforts to help speed the victory of the heroic Vietnamese people. The implication of still more Soviet aid to help defeat the United States in Vietnam came during the closing speech of the three-month-long campaign to elect a new rubber-stamp parliament of 1,517 deputies Sunday. He coupled his warning of new Soviet aid to Vietnam with a plea for a radical turn in European affairs aimed at improving East-West relations.A solution in Vietnam and the insuring of a European security would, he said, alter the entire situation in the world and thereby facilitate the attainment of other goals important for peoples of the world such as the end of the arms race, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and general controlled disarmament. Mr. Brezhnev is a candidate for a third-term re-election for the Bauman district of Moscow, a traditional working class area. Like all of his fellow candidates across the country, he faces no opposition.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, June 11, 1966"}
{"text": "The Bronx Museum of the Arts said Thursday that a long-planned show of works to be lent from the National Museum of Fine Arts in Cuba  part of a major exchange originally scheduled to happen this year  would be delayed until early next year at the soonest because of legal, diplomatic and logistical hurdles.Last summer, more than 80 works of art from the Bronx Museums permanent collection, dating from the 1960s to the present, traveled to the National Museum in Cuba, representing the first part of the two-country exhibition, titled Wild Noise, the largest collaboration between Cuban and United States museums in more than 50 years. But the Bronx half of the collaboration has turned out to be more complicated, in part because of questions about whether state-owned art works from Cuba could be in danger of being seized while in the United States to satisfy legal claims by Americans whose property was confiscated in Cuba after Fidel Castro took power in 1959.The delay of the exhibition, first reported by The Art Newspaper, was not primarily caused by concerns of such a legal seizure, said Holly Block, the executive director of the Bronx Museum. She said a recent change in the directorship of the National Museum in Cuba, along with complications involving shipping, a need to make repairs to some air-conditioning systems at the Bronx Museum and the demands on her small staff have all contributed to the delay. But she said concerns about protecting the lent artwork from legal seizure had factored into a decision to move the exhibition to January 2017, and for the Bronx Museum to make applications for legal immunity to the State Department and for insurance indemnity to the National Endowment for the Arts.Since the United States imposed an embargo on trade between the two countries in 1960, exhibitions of Cuban art have been organized here, and pieces from private American collections have gone on view in Cuba. But there has never been an exchange like the one being planned by the two museums.The possibility of seizure has been a worry from the very beginning, Ms. Block said. There are no test cases for something like this, because it hasnt been done. She said that the applications for immunity and indemnification, which are often made by American museums borrowing works from other countries, would be submitted sometime this summer."}

{"text": "Brian De Palma is a devotee of the long take. His oeuvre is a catalog of extended following shots, seamless action sequences and slow-building scenes of intimacy and brutality. So it seems only fitting that De Palma, an affectionate and absorbing documentary by Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow, has the appearance of a single, uninterrupted encounter between camera and subject. Mr. De Palma, dressed in two layers of blue, tells the story of his career with energy and good humor, occasionally interrupted by clips from his own films and some by other directors that are relevant to his work.The first of these is Alfred Hitchcocks Vertigo, which Mr. De Palma, who is now 75, recalls seeing at a New York theater as a teenager. The Hitchcock-De Palma connection is not exactly news, but the juxtaposition of images from both of their works and Mr. De Palmas specific account of what he learned from the master go far beyond the usual glib critical shorthand. Mr. De Palma argues that Hitchcocks general influence is overstated and that he himself is the only true heir among later generations of American filmmakers.Anyone who has seen Obsession or Dressed to Kill is likely to agree. The structural ingenuity, psychological perversity and visual bravura that characterize Mr. De Palmas films can all plausibly be called Hitchcockian. But in De Palma, he discusses, in roughly chronological order, the full range of styles and genres he has explored. (For New Yorkers interested in sampling the fruits of that exploration, the Metrograph in Lower Manhattan is hosting a monthlong retrospective, with 35-millimeter prints of many of the films.)In the 1960s, as a student first at Columbia and then at Sarah Lawrence, Mr. De Palma was drawn not to violence or suspense but to mischievous, countercultural comedy. His collaborators included Jill Clayburgh, William Finley and Robert De Niro, who looks shockingly young in footage from The Wedding Party, the first feature Mr. De Palma completed.Lasting a little less than two hours, De Palma proceeds quickly and nimbly through more than half a century of filmmaking, naturally dwelling on the 70s and 80s, Mr. De Palmas hectic, heroic decades. His candor and good humor keep things moving, and its clear that he feels comfortable with his unseen, unheard interlocutors, who are colleagues as well as fans. Some Hollywood dirt is dished, and a few personal matters are touched upon, but the focus remains on the details of moviemaking as an art and a business.The tension between commercial imperatives and creative ambition is a recurring theme in Mr. De Palmas career, as it has been for other directors and writers before and since. He holds no grudges  or at least not as many as you might expect  and counts himself lucky to have arrived at a time when the Hollywood system was perhaps uniquely open to risk-taking and personal expression.He also was fortunate to find the support and friendship of talented peers like Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese. Nostalgia for the New Hollywood may be old hat by now, but Mr. De Palmas recollections are so vivid and warm that ancient war stories seem fresh. Its hard for even the most determinedly forward-looking film critic to suppress a twinge of generational envy. Forty years ago, we would have been contemplating Carrie, Jaws and Taxi Driver, with the two Godfather movies in the rearview mirror and Star Wars on the horizon.Not that the critics were always kind to Mr. De Palma. While Pauline Kael was an early and mostly steadfast champion, other reviewers objected to the violence and sensationalism of his movies. Audience enthusiasm also ran hot and cold. There were big hits like Carrie, Dressed to Kill and The Untouchables, flops like Casualties of War, Bonfire of the Vanities and Mission to Mars. Most of his movies landed in the middle of the popularity bell curve, but a surprising number have lingered in the popular imagination, notably (and to the continued surprise of its director) Scarface.Like any good work of criticism, De Palma will be catnip for passionate fans while also serving as a primer and a goad for the skeptical and the curious. Mr. De Palma is remarkable company  witty, insightful and neither unduly modest nor overbearingly vain. Its almost hard to believe that he could have made so many wild, haunting and provocative movies, but by the end of the documentary, you may want nothing more than to see them all.De Palma is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Mr. De Palmas favorite phrase is Holy Mackerel, but his movies are full of sex, gore and nudity.  Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes."}
{"text": "The Mets already have one pitcher from Long Island, Steven Matz, and they potentially added two more in Thursday nights amateur draft.The Mets chose the right-hander Justin Dunn of Freeport, N.Y., and Boston College with the 19th overall pick, and the left-hander Anthony Kay of Stony Brook and the University of Connecticut with the 31st pick. Kay is from the same town as Matz and attended the same high school (Ward Melville).Baseball America rated Dunn, who started and pitched in relief for the Eagles, as the drafts 24th-best prospect, and Kay the 35th.The 6-foot-2, 184-pound Dunn was 4-1 this season with a 1.49 E.R.A. in 17 appearances (seven starts) and two saves.

{"text": "WASHINGTON  A judge may not hear an appeal in a death penalty case that he worked on as a prosecutor, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday in a 5-to-3 decision. The court also issued divided decisions in two other cases, ruling that Puerto Rico cannot try defendants in local courts for conduct already prosecuted in federal court, and that discharged juries may be called back in some cases to fix mistakes in their verdicts.The death penalty case concerned Ronald D. Castille, who was Philadelphias district attorney in 1986 when he authorized the capital prosecution of Terrance Williams. Mr. Williams and a friend, both 18, were accused of killing Amos Norwood, 56, with a tire iron.Approved to proceed on the death penalty, Mr. Castille wrote on a subordinates memorandum.Mr. Williams was convicted and sentenced to death. Later, when Mr. Castille was running for a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, he said he was reluctant to take a firm public position on the death penalty, fearing it would require his recusal from all capital cases.I can certainly say I sent 45 people to death row as district attorney of Philadelphia, he told a legal newspaper in 1993, adding that voters sort of get the hint. Mr. Williams was the first of those 45.In 2012, as the courts chief justice, Mr. Castille denied a request from Mr. Williamss lawyers that he disqualify himself from hearing an appeal based on claims of prosecutorial misconduct by the office he had led. Although a lower court had accepted the claims, Mr. Castille, about two weeks before he retired at the end of 2014, joined a unanimous decision reinstating Mr. Williamss death sentence.In an interview, Mr. Castille said his role in the case as district attorney had been merely administrative. I didnt try the case, he said. I wasnt really involved in the case except as the leader of the office.On Thursday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said Mr. Castilles participation in the case required his recusal. Chief Justice Castilles significant, personal involvement in a critical decision in Williamss case gave rise to an unacceptable risk of actual bias, Justice Kennedy wrote.Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority decision in the case, Williams v. Pennsylvania, No. 15-5040. The court ordered the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to rehear Mr. Williamss appeal.Justice Kennedy said the Constitutions due process clause guarantees that no man can be a judge in his own case.In dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the majority opinion rests on proverb rather than precedent.The due process clause did not prohibit Chief Justice Castille from hearing Williamss case, Chief Justice Roberts wrote. That does not mean, however, that it was appropriate for him to do so, as recusal might have been required under state law and ethics rules.It is up to state authorities  not this court  to determine whether recusal should be required, Chief Justice Roberts wrote.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Chief Justice Robertss dissent. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate dissent, saying that the specter of bias alone in a judicial proceeding is not a deprivation of due process._____In a narrow decision steeped in history, the court ruled, 6 to 2, that Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign for purposes of the Constitutions double jeopardy clause, which forbids subsequent prosecutions for the same crimes.The Supreme Court has said that the federal government and the states are independent sovereigns, meaning that the same conduct can be prosecuted separately in state and federal courts. Puerto Rico lacks such authority, the court ruled on Thursday in Puerto Rico v. Snchez Valle, No. 15-108, addressing a deeply contested matter of politics and pride.The case concerned Luis M. Snchez Valle and Gmez Vzquez, who were prosecuted on gun charges in local and federal courts in Puerto Rico. They pleaded guilty to the federal charges and asserted that they could not be prosecuted for the same crimes in local courts under the Constitutions double jeopardy clause.Puerto Ricos Supreme Court agreed. Puerto Ricos authority to prosecute individuals is derived from its delegation by United States Congress and not by virtue of its own sovereignty, the courts majority said.In an opinion affirming that judgment on Thursday, Justice Kagan said Puerto Rico does as a contemporary matter have many important attributes of sovereignty. Since Puerto Rico became a territory in 1898, she wrote, the United States and Puerto Rico have forged a unique political relationship, built on the islands evolution into a constitutional democracy exercising local self-rule.But she said the legal test for analyzing the double jeopardy question was a historical one and that the commonwealth failed it.For purposes of the double jeopardy clause, the future is not what matters  and there is no getting away from the past, Justice Kagan wrote. Because the ultimate source of Puerto Ricos prosecutorial power is the federal government  because when we trace that authority all the way back, we arrive at the doorstep of the U.S. Capitol  the commonwealth and the United States are not separate sovereigns.Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg and Alito joined the majority opinion, and Justice Thomas for the most part concurred in it. Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Sotomayor, dissented, saying that the majoritys test was too narrow and mechanical, and that it failed to grapple with all of the historical evidence._____The court also ruled, 6 to 2, that federal judges in civil cases may sometimes recall jurors they have discharged for further deliberations after discovering that their verdict did not make sense.The case, Dietz v. Bouldin, No. 15-458, arose from a car crash in Bozeman, Mont., in which all sides agreed that the plaintiff was owed at least $10,136. But the jury, apparently assuming that the sum had already been paid, awarded nothing. A few minutes after the jurors left the courtroom, the judge ordered them to come back for more deliberations, and they eventually awarded $15,000.Justice Sotomayor, writing for the majority, said that recalling the jurors had been permissible, though she cautioned that judges should be wary of long delays, ask whether jurors had spoken to outsiders, and not use the procedure if the verdict had given rise to gasps, crying, cheering and the like.In dissent, Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Kennedy, said there should be a categorical rule against ever recalling discharged jurors.After discharge, Justice Thomas wrote, the court has no power to impose restrictions on jurors, and jurors are no longer under oath to obey them.Jurors may access their cellphones and get public information about the case, he said. They may talk to counsel or the parties. They may overhear comments in the hallway as they leave the courtroom. And they may reflect on the case  away from the pressure of the jury room  in a way that could induce them to change their minds. The resulting prejudice can be hard to detect."}
{"text": "A few years ago, the board that administers the certified financial planner designation decided to test the idea that investors will ask pointed questions of a prospective adviser and not be fooled by a slick presentation.So the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards hired a professional D.J. named Azmyth Kaminski, shaved off his dreadlocks, removed his body piercings and put him in a suit. It taught him a few financial phrases and sat him in a conference room. Then it brought in people looking for a financial adviser.We gave him buzzwords, like 401(k) is the way to go, said Joe Maugeri, managing director for corporate relations at the CFP Board. I talked to him about 529 plans and he said, All 56 states have 529 plans? I said, Well, yes, all 50 of them have them. He was a real nice guy.So how did he do? After Mr. Kaminski spent about 15 minutes with each person, all but one were ready to work with him, Mr. Maugeri said.While Mr. Kaminski may have charisma, he obviously had little insight into financial matters. But the experience presents an interesting conundrum for people seeking advice: how best to determine if a financial adviser is qualified for the job. And a related question: With financial advising becoming a second career for some people, are they bringing something more to the table because of their previous experience?Too often people fixate on ferreting out the worst advisers. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authoritys BrokerCheck website lists brokers who have had complaints filed against them, what kinds of complaints were filed and how they were resolved.But that focuses on the past and, in the worst cases, the broker does not appear on the list until long after a problem has been detected. The bigger issue is often not whether a broker is a swindler. The odds of that are not high. It is whether the person advising you is qualified to do the job.And figuring out the answer takes a lot of legwork. John Bucsek, managing partner of MetLife Solutions Group, said in a recent report that people should question prospective advisers about their qualifications, their team and their commitment to staying in the industry.Mr. Maugeri suggested asking pointed questions. You give them scenarios, he said. You ask them questions in specific areas. You want someone who is listening more than telling.John Bowman, managing director of the Americas at the CFA Institute, which administers the chartered financial analyst designation, said investors should ensure that the person making the investment decisions  as opposed to the adviser creating a financial plan  has the qualifications, knowledge and experience to make those selections.Aligning your interests with someone who had a previous career, maybe one similar to what you are doing now, makes a certain sense. But how do you know if that person is truly qualified or just looking for a new start?One answer is that credentials help. They show seriousness about the profession. And that, mixed with the ability to listen to and understand your particular position, can help you reach your goals.Gregory Kasten, an anesthesiologist by training, finished his medical residency at the University of Kentucky in 1983 and stayed on staff. At the time, he said, the investing options offered through the university were limited to an annuity or a stock fund. Outside of that, he was being bombarded by brokers trying to sell him partnerships or mutual funds with high fees.I wondered if I couldnt do better if I took care of that myself, Dr. Kasten said.That led to him talking investments in the doctors lounge and, initially, a second job advising his fellow doctors as a registered investment adviser. When he hit $70 million of assets under management in 1992, he quit being a doctor. Today, he runs Unified Trust, a $4.5 billion trust company.What Dr. Kasten brought to his financial advisory practice, at first anyway, was the ability to connect with his fellow doctors. He knew how their income came in. He understood their concerns. Most of all, he knew they did not have the time or the desire to think about investing. They wanted to practice medicine.But he backed up that trust with adviser credentials, from a designation as a certified financial planner to a masters in business administration. I see the two professions as very similar, he said. There is a series of best practices, a code of ethics, the doctor-patient relationship. Its not playing professional baseball and being a doctor.Joel Shaps, managing director at United Capital in Silicon Valley, said he came to advising after being an executive at Neiman Marcus and founding a consulting company that specialized in accounts payable. Shortly after selling that company, he bought the financial adviser he had worked with, increasing it in size to $325 million from $40 million.When your roots are in retailing and especially when youre a store manager at Neiman Marcus, one of the key components of your role is to give great advice, he said. You need to have great client skills and understand what youre doing and how to communicate it.While he said he had an ability to connect with clients, he also said he knew enough to bring in people who had expertise he did not.Mr. Maugeri noted the value of both. Theres a benefit in working with someone who has experience in the business world, but there is also a benefit to working with someone coming right out of college with the latest thinking on financial advising, he said. Thats why people are moving into teams.But the measure of an adviser should be the same for those who have come from another career and those who have been in the business all along.There are a lot of successful people who are trying to leverage their success in other businesses and apply it to advice, Mr. Bowman said. I would just challenge them with the same question, How do you feel prepared and competent to handle this persons life savings?The risk is that someone decided to hang out a shingle and become an adviser with little knowledge or because a previous career did not work out.Our profession has a low barrier to entry, Mr. Bowman said. Im talking about all of those people out there who arent bound by an ethical code or have certain core competence. We need to start pulling up fortified walls to protect people.The chartered financial analystdesignation is about a persons ability to assess investments and provide advice on them. The certified financial planner credential speaks to the persons ability to help clients create plans for their financial lives.Both groups are also trying to make the argument that their designations mean more than the 176 other designations, by Mr. Maugeris count, that can be placed after a persons name with few or not very rigorous requirements. And the two groups are campaigning to raise public awareness about their designations.Credentials, no matter how rigorous, go only so far, of course. In a recent settlement, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay two former clients, both retired professional athletes, more than $800,000 for actions related to Aaron R. Parthemer, a broker in Miami who managed about $250 million. Mr. Parthemer, who was barred from the securities industry in 2015, held the C.F.P. designation and was also recognized as a registered player financial adviser by the National Football Leagues Player Association.As to the D.J. who posed as a financial adviser, Mr. Maugeri said that one person still wanted to use him as a financial adviser even after finding out the truth.It told us a lot about how consumers choose a financial adviser, Mr. Maugeri said. And how so much of it is impressions and saying the right thing."}

{"text": "AENEID BOOK VIA New Verse TranslationBy Seamus Heaney97 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.For poets, the old myths are not quaint and remote; they are resonant paradigms of contemporary life. The hero abandoned on a desert island for 10 years because of a suppurating wound, whose implacable hatred must be overcome if a great war is to be won; the girl whose individual sense of justice contends with the tyranny and political dishonesty of her uncle; the hero who must visit his dead father in the underworld both for comfort and for counsel  these are some of the myths that guided the Irish Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney (1939-2013).In The Cure at Troy (1990), a skillful translation and adaptation of Sophocles play about the wounded Greek archer Philoctetes marooned on Lemnos and brought back to the Trojan War by Odysseus, Heaney found a parable for the need for forgiveness between bitterly opposed factions during the Troubles in Ireland. In The Burial at Thebes (2004), he explored, in the contest between Antigone and her uncle Creon, the demagoguery and false motives guiding the American adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan, even as Jean Anouilh before him had used the same myth to address both the Resistance and the Nazis in occupied Paris during World War II.But no myth, perhaps, had a longer grip on Heaneys imagination than the reunion with the beloved dead represented by Aeneas journey to the underworld in Book VI of Virgils Aeneid. Poetry proposes that, by the power of language, we may achieve vision; and the boundary between the living and the dead is poetrys ultimate frontier. It was a frontier visited frequently by this supremely gifted poet before his own sudden death in 2013, a death he met with characteristic fortitude, and a viaticum sent as a text message to his wife: Noli timere (Be not afraid).The journey described in Heaneys translation, like its Virgilian original, has both a personal and a political dimension. In the Aeneid the heros father, Anchises, whom Aeneas carried out of the burning city of Troy on his back, dies in Book III at Drepanum (Trapani), Sicily. With the help of the Cumaean Sibyl, Aeneas undertakes the frightening journey to visit him among the dead, both out of filial devotion and in order to gain a vision of his own epic posterity: the mythical descendants, culminating in the historical Augustus, who will establish the Roman Empire. Heaneys relationship with his own father seems to have had an intensity like that between Aeneas and Anchises  indeed, we see the father cutting peat in the first poem in Heaneys first book, Death of a Naturalist (1966): By God, the old man could handle a spade./Just like his old man, and the son, as poet, has exchanged a spade for a pen, though with no sense that he can surpass his father in his parallel but different labor. In Elysium, Aeneas famously tries three times to embrace his father, but his arms encounter only empty air. The yearning of this moment would have been part of Heaneys inspiration for undertaking the translation.The political dimension of the journey, and the translation, is more complicated, however. Heaney describes this portion of the Aeneid as the worst of books for its imperial certitude, its celebration of Romes manifest destiny and the catalog of Roman heroes that Heaney says constitutes a test for reader and translator alike but is also something that had to be gone through with. Heaneys dissatisfaction is not just with the technical challenges of trudging through a succession of varyingly obscure cardboard heroes. He describes his work as neither a version nor a crib, and therefore he must translate the boring bits along with the lively ones. But as an Irish Catholic born in the Protestant north, Heaney was positioned as few other poets could have been (except for his peers Derek Walcott, Joseph Brodsky, Czeslaw Milosz and Zbigniew Herbert) to appreciate the ambiguity of any imperial cultural achievement  Roman, British, German or Russian, for example  given the ruthless assimilation or extinction of competing cultures that such an achievement demands. Part of his poetic legacy, indeed, was to balance between north and south, between Protestant and Catholic, to hope for a great sea-change/On the far side of revenge and never to lose sight of human values he believed could transcend political struggle.Seen from one point of view, Heaney trained for years before venturing into the underworld in this translation. His mothers death he had commemorated in the magisterial sonnet cycle Clearances (1987). Other books include poems addressed to dead poets: To the Shade of Zbigniew Herbert (2001), To Pablo Neruda in Tamlaghtduff and To George Seferis in the Underworld (2006) as well as his translation of a poem by Constantine Cavafy taking its title from the last words spoken by the dying hero in Sophocles play Ajax: The rest Ill speak of to the ones below in Hades. And by his own account, a 2010 poem called Route 110 maps the landscape of Book VI onto the rural Northern Ireland of his own childhood, the scene in Elysium not unlike a sports day in Bellaghy. And that earlier foray into the world below culminates for Heaney, not in death, but in celebrating the birth of a first granddaughter in 2006, a kind of uncomplicated fulfillment, on an autobiographical scale, of the epic posterity recounted in Virgils poem.Heaney translates the Virgilian hexameter into a loose five-beat line. As the Cumaean Sibyl remarks to Aeneas, the problem with the underworld lies not in the outbound journey but in the return:It is easy to descend into Avernus.Deaths dark door stands open day and night.But to retrace your steps and get back to upper air,That is the task, that is the undertaking.With characteristic brilliance, Heaney refuses to let words and images not earn their keep. Some of his felicities he achieves simply by close translation from the Latin (which is helpfully included on facing pages of this bilingual edition). Discordia demens, for example, becomes the headline-worthy fanatical violence. Others he achieves through the imagination and the ear. Charon, who ferries the souls of the dead, is bearded with unclean white shag in a world of congregating dark where the three-headed dog of hell is pacified with a dumpling of soporific honey, and the guilty are punished in Tartarus to the sound of the fling and scringe and drag/Of iron chains. A helmsman cast adrift remarks that a south wind/Hurled me and burled me, and the seas surface is molten marble. When Aeneas says to the Sibyl, I have foreseen/And foresuffered all, it might be argued that Heaney is hewing a bit too close to Eliots Tiresias in The Waste Land, but there is pleasure even in this literary nod.Interviewed in Rome three months before his death, Heaney was asked whether he feared the end. I think literature has helped, he replied. Mythology has helped. Perhaps he will drink the water of Lethe eventually, forget his past life and return to this world, which greatly has need of his humanity and his intelligence. Or perhaps he is among those few who can remain in Paradiseuntil the end of timeWhen length of days will remove the deep-dyed taint,Purify the aethereal sense and that sheer original stuffOf fire and spirit.In any case, Heaney has left us with this wonderful new translation of a classic."}

{"text": "With the rise of the art market and the power of the auction world over the past several years, the medium of drawing can often feel lost in a conversation dominated by wall-power paintings and room-filling sculpture. But over roughly that same period, the Menil Collection in Houston has been developing a center devoted exclusively to modern and contemporary drawing, and last year it broke ground on a free-standing building for the Menil Drawing Institute, founded in 2008.On Thursday, the museum announced one of the largest donations of artworks in its history, a collection of 110 drawings from the holdings of two trustees that will serve as the backbone of the new institute and make Houston one of the most important cities for seeing drawing, especially that of 20th-century titans like Jasper Johns, Jackson Pollock and Robert Rauschenberg.The drawings, from the collections of Janie C. Lee, a former art-gallery owner and curator, and Louisa Stude Sarofim, a prominent Houston arts patron and chairwoman of the Menils board, include 15 by Mr. Johns alone, representing every decade of his career, and significant work by Philip Guston, Eva Hesse, Agnes Martin, Claes Oldenburg and Ellsworth Kelly.Ive never been a collector with a capital C, Ms. Sarofim said in a telephone interview. Its just been a matter of looking, and loving art. She met Ms. Lee decades ago and began buying works from her gallery, she said, and built her drawings collection under the guidance of Bernice Rose, the former drawings curator for the Museum of Modern Art and organizer of the seminal 1976 show there, Drawing Now: 1955-1975.Ms. Lee said she began collecting drawings primarily because they were what she could afford. But then I began to realize how important drawing has been to artists, in fact a crucial part of many artists work, she said. And I began to realize that there was not a place where one could go exclusively to see and study drawing, a place dedicated to it. And thats how conversations about the institute began.Along with a bequest of 17 drawings that went to the Menil in 2005 from the curator and collector David Hay Whitney, the new works will give the institute  expected to open next year  a history of the medium sweeping all the way from Czanne to living artists like Mr. Johns, Robert Gober and Rachel Whiteread.Drawings often show the mental process that goes into art making, said David Breslin, the drawing institutes chief curator. And when were so accustomed to celebrating the masterpiece, its amazing to go back to see the daily work of being an artist."}
{"text": "Rafael Nadal announced Thursday that he would not play Wimbledon as he continues to recover from a left wrist injury, which also forced him to withdraw from the French Open.As you can all imagine, its a very tough decision, but the injury I suffered at Roland Garros needs time to heal, Nadal said in a post on his Facebook page.Nadal, ranked No. 4, is a two-time Wimbledon champion, but he has not advanced past the fourth round since losing the final in 2011. This years tournament begins June 27.After losing in the first round of the Australian Open in January, Nadal had been having a resurgent spring on clay, winning in Monte Carlo and Barcelona and reaching the semifinals in Madrid.But he stunned the French Open last month when, before his third-round match, he pulled out of the tournament with an inflamed tendon sheath in his left wrist. He said he could no longer hit a topspin forehand, his signature shot, without major pain.Nadal, who turned 30 last week, has struggled with injuries, particularly in his knees, throughout his career. He withdrew from the 2014 United States Open with a right wrist injury.Nadal said the pain in his left wrist began at the Madrid tournament in early May and continued at the Rome event the next week. At the time, he treated it with anti-inflammatories. But the injury grew worse when he arrived in Paris.He played his second-round match after receiving a painkilling injection, and on May 27, the day he withdrew, he said he could not move much the wrist.He said his doctor told him he risked a tear if he continued playing.If I continue to play, it will break, and that will mean months off the tour, Nadal said.Nadals spokesman, Benito Perez-Barbadillo, said in a statement that Nadals wrist would remain in a cast for two more weeks, and then he would begin anti-inflammatory treatments and physical therapy.The first major United States Open tuneup event on hardcourts is the Rogers Cup in Toronto in late July. The Olympic tennis tournament in Rio de Janeiro begins Aug. 6, and Nadal was chosen as Spains flag bearer for the opening ceremony. During the French Open, Nadal called the Olympics the most important event in the world of sport and spoke of his disappointment in missing the 2012 London Games with a knee injury.Nadals longtime rival, Roger Federer, who missed the French Open because of injuries, returned to action Thursday with a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 win over the American teenager Taylor Fritz at the Mercedes Cup grass-court event in Stuttgart, Germany. The match started on Wednesday, but was suspended in the first set because of rain.Federer had surgery on his left knee in February and withdrew from the Madrid tournament because of back problems in May. He had not played on tour since a round of 16 loss to Dominic Thiem in Rome on May 12.I was a little bit cautious, unsure of how to move and questioning my defense, Federer said on the ATP Tour website. These are the things I will need to iron out.I can take a lot of confidence out of this match. I need to improve a few things, but I served big and I was able to handle three sets over two days, and find some energy at the end of the match. I know I have an extra gear."}

He also played guitar on Solange Knowless 2013 tour when he was still a theater major at Purchase College. His two ambitions collided last year when he was asked to play with Ms. Knowles at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the same week he had an acting showcase. He hustled and did both.

The list between me and him is just ridiculous, the similarities. The Venn diagram is nasty.Musical Journey In his teens and early 20s, Mr. Cook was focused on rap before finding his R&B-inflected sound. I just couldnt really write any verses any more, he said. Then, right when nothing was coming to me, I just started leaning into my older sensibilities, and those I think started to come more to life."}
{"text": "They are among wars invisible wounds: the emotional and cognitive problems that many troops experience years after combat explosions sent huge shock waves through their brains. Whereas the link between concussions and post-traumatic stress disorder has become clearer in recent years, a specific connection between PTSD and blast waves has remained elusive.Now, a prominent neuropathologist who researches brain injuries among military personnel says his team has identified evidence of tissue damage caused by blasts alone, not by concussions or other injuries. The teams study was published on Thursday in The Lancet Neurology.The discovery could eventually lead to better treatments and to improved head and body protection for troops exposed to high-energy blasts, some experts said. Other researchers advised that these initial findings should be bolstered by more studies before veterans and their families read too much into them.We talk about PTSD being a psychiatric problem  how people responded to the horror of warfare, said Dr. Daniel P. Perl, the neuropathologist who led the study. But at least in some cases, no  their brain has been damaged.The real black box is to figure out who has this, added Dr. Perl, who works at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., the medical school run by the Department of Defense.Even the tentative results provided some solace to Jennifer Collins, who was married to one of the five male military veterans whose damaged brains were examined in the study. Her husband, David, served 17 years in the Navy SEALs, enduring countless explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He retired in 2012, and steadily developed significant depression, sleeplessness and memory loss. He killed himself in March 2014.This is proof that this man died in combat, Ms. Collins said in a telephone interview, sobbing and struggling to find words. It took several years to kill him, but he died in combat. This finding is further validation about what I know about my husband.It is unclear how many of the 2.5 million United States service members deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were exposed to blasts. A 2008 report by the RAND Corporation suggested that the number could be about 500,000. But some estimates suggest the problem could be greater: For example, a 2014 study of 34 living veterans from those conflicts found that a majority had experienced at least five blasts.Explosions from roadside bombs, grenades and other devices produce a wide spectrum of injuries. Beyond the shrapnel and other objects that impale the head and body, the hurricane-force wind can blow troops off their feet, causing fatal head injuries and concussions on impact.Less understood is how the blast wave  the pulse of compressed air that shoots in all directions faster than the speed of sound and arrives before the wind  affects brain tissue after crashing through the helmet and skull. Blasts are also believed to compress the sternum and send shock waves through the bodys blood vessels and up into the brain.The researchers examined the brains of the five veterans who had been exposed to blasts, and compared samples with those of 16 other veterans and civilians with and without brain injuries from military service or other activities. Scar tissue in specific locations of the cerebral cortex, which regulates emotional and cognitive functioning, was found only in the blast-injury cases.All five of those men also suffered from the symptoms of PTSD, which, given the location of the scarring, suggests that a physical combat injury could have led to or exacerbated their psychological troubles, Dr. Perl said. Any such connection, now only speculative and needing further research, could lead to a better understanding of a link between combat and PTSD, said Dr. Ibolja Cernak, the chairwoman of military rehabilitation research at the University of Alberta.Dr. Cernak likened the blast-injury study published in The Lancet Neurology to the first reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among professional football players, whose disease was linked to repetitive on-field brain trauma and helped explain some of their cognitive and emotional problems decades later. As with C.T.E., the damage connected to blasts does not appear on any magnetic resonance imaging test or brain scan and can be located only after death.This could be for the military population what C.T.E. was for football players  enormous, Dr. Cernak said of the research.Beyond treatment options, the findings raise the possibility that better head protection for active soldiers could ameliorate a blast waves damage. Dr. Ralph G. DePalma, a special operations officer in the office of research and development at the Department of Veterans Affairs, called that prospect probably the most important aspect of this paper.Looking at the mechanism of how the injury occurs and possible interventions immediately, thats something that the Department of Defense is very interested in, Dr. DePalma said. We know that certain blast exposures, the angles at which the blast encounters the face and helmet matters. So you can look at protection.Some experts are concerned that as significant as identifying blast-related damage in the brain can be, linking it to PTSD is premature. For example, Mr. Collinss brain also showed signs of C.T.E., which has been found in previous autopsies of military veterans and could have contributed to his psychiatric condition. One of the other four subjects in the study had very small signs of C.T.E., but the other three showed none.We have to be very certain  its about not jumping the gun, not jumping to conclusions about the significance of the changes we find in the brain in terms of a persons prognosis or their symptoms, said Dr. Ann McKee, the chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System. She and others at Boston University have identified C.T.E. in the brains of about 100 former N.F.L. players and some military veterans.Until we really understand how those changes come about and what the changes really mean, she added, we wont understand the clinical factors that lead to disability from these diseases.Dr. DePalma added that even if no treatments could be developed for years, soldiers should not assume that they would emerge from combat with damage from blast waves. Genetics are believed to influence whether a football player will develop C.T.E., so military combat may pose different risks to different people.Its not, Oh my God, if Im exposed to blasts Im going to go crazy, Dr. DePalma said."}
{"text": "The main sleight-of-hand at play in the illusion-themed sequel, Now You See Me 2, will be convincing audiences that a single oddball idea  and four bickering, bragging leads  can support a successful franchise. And while the first movie had a certain goofy charm, its appeal barely stretched to feature length. This time the director, Louis Leterrier, has been replaced by Jon M. Chu, who, with G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), has proved himself more than comfortable with noise and nonsense.And this cartoonish movie has plenty of both. A brief recap reminds us that the so-called Four Horsemen  Las Vegas magicians played by Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Jesse Eisenberg and Lizzy Caplan (replacing Isla Fisher as the token she-geek)  are lying low after robbing a casino in Paris. Called out of hiding by their handler-cum-F.B.I. agent (an essential Mark Ruffalo), our prestidigitators must steal a tech doodad that can control all the worlds computers.Technology might be the enemy of the plot, but its the best friend of a movie that bounces from New York to Macau and from one stupendously slick stunt to another. Everything is supersized and preposterous, but Mr. Chu, with two films in the Step Up franchise under his belt, is undaunted by crowds and confusion. As is Peter Demings cinematography, which uses speed and shadow to blur the ludicrousness of the cons and fake-outs.But the film is an emotional black hole, its insufferably smug tricksters augmented by Mr. Harrelson  wearing too many teeth and a wig reminiscent of Dont Look Now-era Donald Sutherland  as his characters identical twin. They never let us forget that their chief superpowers are glibness and ego.Now You See Me 2 is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). One bra, two beheadings and an avalanche of boasting."}
{"text": "IN PRAISE OF FORGETTINGHistorical Memory and Its IroniesBy David Rieff145 pp. Yale University Press. $25.It was like the sound of rain, the sound of firebombs dropping, Keiko Utsumi remembers. She is an elderly, dignified Japanese woman, retired as a nurse and a midwife, impeccably dressed in a beige linen blazer in the sweltering Tokyo summer heat. Late in World War II, during the spring of 1945, she was 16 years old, put to work at a military factory in the port city of Yokohama, just south of Tokyo. During one of the United States incendiary bombing raids, she recalls huddling in a bomb shelter all night, terrified, watching the inferno of wooden houses all around. When she emerged into a scorched wasteland the next morning, with the ground so hot it melted her shoes, she saw the dead: They were all black, all burned.Seventy years after the end of the war, Utsumi met me in central Tokyo last August to tell her story. Remarkably, she had never discussed her terrible experiences with anyone. When I was leaving the house this morning, she said, and told my son Id be in an interview about the war, my son asked, You were in the war?This kind of stoic quietude may seem odd, even unhealthy, to Americans, accustomed to ventilating the most mundane experiences, with no incident too banal to be rehashed. But respect for such forbearance is at the heart of David Rieffs insightful and humane new book.In Praise of Forgetting is about our collective memories: how we remember our national histories and argue about our shared past. Rieff contends that these collective remembrances are self-serving, often fraudulent and frequently dangerous. Sometimes, he thinks, we would be better off simply forgetting the grudge-filled chronicles and getting on with living our lives. He admires the suggestion of a Northern Irish writer that the next memorial to Irish history should be raising a monument to Amnesia, and forgetting where we put it.Rieff recoils at the conceit that memorialization is a moral and political duty, as well as a personal one in our therapeutic age. To the contrary, he says, remembering is ultimately futile, since all societies will  like the mortal individuals who make them up  eventually crumble to dust. To those who hope that remembering the Holocaust might help avert future genocides, he retorts that this is magical thinking, pointing to subsequent extermination campaigns in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Rwanda.Instead, he warns that all too often, collective memory has led to war rather than peace ... and to the determination to exact revenge rather than commit to the hard work of forgiveness. For Rieff, national remembrances are almost always political, sometimes imposed by victorious armies, at other times drummed up by manipulative politicians seeking to fabricate an epic past to legitimize their present-day intentions. He provides a depressing abundance of examples where toxic memories fuel atavistic hatred: among Iraqis; Israelis and Palestinians; radical Islamists across the globe; and Hindu chauvinists rallied by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.This is no abstract dread for Rieff, a distinguished journalist known for eviscerating American and European failures in Bosnia and later for thoughtfully questioning the value of international humanitarian organizations. Having been an eyewitness to Yugoslavias collapse, he understands the grotesque realities of ethnic strife and power politics with stark clarity. He disgustedly recalls visiting a Serb nationalist politician in Belgrade who, as the war raged in Bosnia, venerated the Serbian guerrillas of World War II, while one of his aides portentously handed Rieff a piece of paper reading 1453  the year when the Ottoman Empire conquered Orthodox Constantinople.Worse, Rieff worries that memory could not just spark violence, but prolong it. In order to end a war, or get a dictator to yield power to democrats, its often necessary to negotiate with murderous leaders who will demand their own amnesty  blotting out their own past cruelties to assure future peace. (Nuremberg, the preferred precedent of human rights lawyers, is almost always the wrong example. It was only after a hard-won unconditional victory that the Allies could put Nazi Germanys rulers on trial, but most wars dont end so decisively.) While Rieff would prosecute war criminals whenever feasible, he rejects the legalistic absolutism of those human rights activists who insist on justice above peace or other worthwhile political goals. He prudently warns that Chiles return to democracy could have been scuttled by a Spanish warrant for the arrest of the military dictator Augusto Pinochet. And in Bosnia, he convincingly argues that the injustice of a Dayton peace agreement that spared the bloodstained Slobodan Milosevic was still far better than continuing a ruinous war.Rieff makes a powerful case for reconciliation and compromise, and exposes how politicized our nationalist histories are. Lucidly deploying historical examples and literary references, he himself seems to have forgotten nothing. But in a book packed with pugnacious argument, he only implicitly offers rules for when to remember and when to forget. Its a delicate matter asking victimized peoples to turn their backs on their grievances; Japanese rightists only further offend Koreans by proclaiming that they need to get over their wartime suffering. And the pursuit of justice, while risky, doesnt always derail peace processes: The Dayton peace deal proceeded even though a United Nations war crimes tribunal had indicted the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.No absolutist himself, Rieff isnt against all remembrance. He believes that we are morally obligated to remember the Holocaust, and praises war crimes trials and truth commissions in Europe, Latin America and South Africa. He vigorously argues that there is a duty to debunk whitewashing about the Armenian genocide, British and French colonial massacres, Imperial Japans sexual enslavement of women from Korea and other Asian nations, and the Srebrenica massacre. (The fact that Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, is defiantly promoting the crackpot slur that Hitler was somehow a kind of Zionist before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews demonstrates that some history lessons are still necessary.)Its one thing for people to settle and move on; its another to get them to forget. Although Mao Zedongs regime worked to normalize Chinas relationship with postwar Japan, including discreetly fixing the blame for World War II on a small clique of militarists, todays Chinese leadership has had little difficulty in whipping up a broader popular rage against Japan. After Croat fascists slaughtered Serbs and Jews in World War II, Yugoslavias postwar Communist dictatorship nevertheless promoted an amnesiac brotherhood and unity. Yet the bad old memories lingered long enough to provide nationalist tinder for Milosevic to exploit in the 1990s. Not all of us have the grace of Keiko Utsumi.Rieffs book feels painfully relevant for todays sour populist mood. As powerful leaders in China, Russia, India, Japan and elsewhere are energetically promoting their own fractured takes on their history, he punctures their pretensions. Donald J. Trumps chest-thumping version of Americas 20th-century experience  We saved the world and then we saved the world again  is unusual only in its brainlessness. This rich book provides a field guide to a more decent politics of forgiveness, in which Trump and Trumpism may one day be mercifully forgotten too."}
{"text": "Cass R. Sunstein is a professor at Harvard Law School, a former official in the Obama administration, an expert in behavioral science and constitutional jurisprudence, and the author of many books, including the best-selling (and somewhat controversial) Nudge. He is, in other words, a formidably accomplished intellectual, an authority on matters that lie beyond the ken of most ordinary citizens.But he is also a regular guy: a son, a father and a big fan of the Star Wars movies. His latest book, The World According to Star Wars, a kind of lay sermon on a sacred pop-cultural text, tries to fuse the strands of his identity, to bring his intelligence and expertise to bear on a phenomenon that is widely known and easily understood and to use that phenomenon to illuminate more arcane matters. What he has written defies easy categorization in ways that are both admirable and exasperating. This is not a work of high-geek pseudo-scholarship. Nor is it film criticism, social history, psychology or philosophy, though it dabbles in all of those disciplines. It is at once vast and sketchy, an anthology of grand statements, petty quibbles and knowing jokes, organized into 10 episodes on subjects that include religion, politics, family dynamics and the nature of human freedom.Writing in informal, TED-talky prose, Mr. Sunstein comes across as an energetic, friendly dinner-party tablemate, the kind who will do all the talking for both of you. Or maybe, to try a more relevant analogy, as a professor eager to hold the flagging attention of his class with up-to-date references and down-to-earth humor. He wants you to know that he digs Taylor Swift and that he feels sorry for you if you dont. He cites wise words from the musician Skrillex. Hes not afraid to make provocative assertions of his own eclectic taste, wielding laudatory adjectives with downright Trumpian relish. William Blake is fabulous, as is J. K. Rowling. Bob Dylan is terrific. Alan Moores Watchmen is sensational. The writers Jonathan Lethem and Ray Bradbury are great, as are the historian Gordon S. Wood and the political thinker Edmund Burke.But of course the greatest, most terrific thing, for his present purposes, is Star Wars itself, the seven feature films (so far) which, for all their individual flaws, are cooler, and more awesome than Star Trek, their nearest rival. And thats not all. In all of human history, Mr. Sunstein writes in his introduction, there has never been a phenomenon like Star Wars. Star Wars is bipartisan and all-American. Star Wars unifies people.Its hard to determine whether hes preaching to the choir or howling into the void. His intended audience includes people who like Star Wars, people who love Star Wars, and people who neither like nor love Star Wars, but this kind of universalism has its pitfalls. One is overreach. It is hard even for the most concise (or profligate) thinker to find something cogent to say about (to cite Mr. Sunsteins own preliminary and partial list) the nature of human attachment, whether timing is everything  how boys need their mothers, the workings of the creative imagination, the fall of Communism, the Arab Spring and a half-dozen other issues.This is a very short book, and it treats its themes in a glib, haphazard fashion. In the episode called Thirteen Ways of Looking at Star Wars  a compendium of outlandish and interesting interpretations of the movies  Mr. Sunstein muses on the nature of conspiracy theories, riffing in the space of a few paragraphs on Lee Harvey Oswald, psychoanalysis, literary criticism and The Bible Code to no evident purpose.Dont Argue, he teasingly cautions the reader at one point, having offered a (perfectly defensible if also profoundly mistaken) ranking of the seven Star Wars movies. But the reader may wish that Mr. Sunstein argued more, or at least more pointedly. Instead, he asks condescending questions (What do Martin Luther King Jr. and Luke Skywalker have in common?) to which he supplies answers that sometimes manage to be shallow, tautological and confusing at the same time:Martin Luther King Jr. was a rebel, unquestionably a Skywalker, with a little Han and more than a little Obi-Wan. He sought fundamental change, but he well knew the power of the intergenerational link.Not all of Mr. Sunsteins attempts to hold Star Wars up as a mirror to society are so flabby. The book improves toward the end, as he gravitates toward the kinds of questions he has been thinking about for much of his career. He looks at how the narrative structure that George Lucas initially envisioned changed over time and finds an enlightening analogy with the ways the Supreme Court has found new meanings in the Constitution. He is perceptive about the way Star Wars dramatizes how rebellions take shape and how democracies tumble into dictatorship.But he also explains too much and too little, and lacks the critical ability to understand which complexities need simplifying and what kinds of simplicity need to be complicated. Its a little like air. Star Wars is here to stay, he concludes. The World According to Star Wars is also like air, but in a different way."}
{"text": "SPOILER alert: Hamilton is going to win the Tony Award for best new musical on Sunday night.But you already knew that. So let me tell you some things you might not realize.Lin-Manuel Miranda is going to have a great night, but hes not likely to win a Tony for his acting.Hamilton is not likely to set a record for the most Tonys won, although it still has a long-shot chance to tie the record 12 won by The Producers in 2001.And, after a diverse season for Broadway, it looks as if black actors could sweep all four awards for performances in musicals.How do I know all this? Every year, The New York Times theater desk interviews Tony voters to inform a story predicting the winners. And this year, we decided to up our game: We partnered with the News Surveys team at The Times and our friends at the Siena College Research Institute to sample the 846 Tony voters.In all, we heard from 171  a much bigger sample than ever before  and asked them not only who they favored in the top races but also how they are feeling about Broadway and its challenges, including the high prices for Hamilton tickets.We only asked about the best shows and the best performances, so if what keeps you up at night is the race for best lighting design, Im afraid you have a few sleepless nights remaining. And, of course, our sample is imperfect in multiple ways, so youll have to wait until Sunday (8 p.m. Eastern on CBS) for the real results. But heres what we think youre likely to see:BURR VS. HAMILTON, AGAIN: Tony voters really, really, really love Hamilton, but in the battle for best leading actor in a musical, they prefer Leslie Odom Jr., the actor portraying Aaron Burr, over Mr. Miranda, who plays the title character.Theres a historical quirkiness to this  Burr, of course, was the nominal victor of the 1804 duel in which he killed Hamilton, but, as the musical proclaims, that victory made him a villain. Mr. Miranda is widely admired as a genius and a visionary, and every Hamilton win on Sunday will be attributable to his creative powers, but the voters appear to have concluded that Mr. Odoms charismatic incarnation of one of American historys best-known bad guys and his razzle-dazzle delivery of the showstopper The Room Where It Happens have earned him the acting award.Mr. Odom is likely to be one of three Hamilton performers who win acting awards on Sunday: Rene Elise Goldsberry, whose rapped/sung deconstruction of a wedding toast (Satisfied) was arguably the most ingenious moment of the theatrical season, looks likely to win as best featured actress for her portrayal of Angelica Schuyler, while Daveed Diggs is likely to win the best featured actor Tony for his knowingly witty portrayals of two important historical figures: Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson.PURPLE REIGN: The last season was excellent for musical revivals, but one stands out for Tony voters: The Color Purple. And Cynthia Erivo, a 29-year-old British actress making her Broadway debut in the show, is not only a critical darling but also the strong favorite to take home the Tony for best leading actress in a musical. Ms. Erivo would be the second actress to win a Tony award for playing Celie; in 2006, LaChanze won for her work in the original production. This would also be the only acting category (in a musical) not won by Hamilton.It was a very strong year for musical actresses, with memorable performances by Laura Benanti in She Loves Me, Carmen Cusack in Bright Star, Jessie Mueller in Waitress and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton  but Ms. Erivos onstage transformation from sexually abused girl to confident woman, and her tear-the-roof-off voice, which routinely prompts mid-act standing ovations, has blown away even her competitors. (GIVE @CynthiaEriVo ALL THE AWARDS, IMMEDIATELY, Ms. Benanti tweeted after seeing the show on May 29.)WHAT ABOUT THE PLAYS? It was a good season for the power producer Scott Rudin, who brought five shows to Broadway, all of which were nominated for Tony awards. And it looks like two of his plays will win: The Humans, as best new play, and A View From the Bridge, as best revival. Both are notable Broadway debuts: The Humans is the first Broadway play written by Stephen Karam, a 36-year-old American playwright, and A View From the Bridge, by Arthur Miller, is directed by Ivo van Hove, a vaunted Belgian director, making a big move into the mainstream. The Humans is also likely to win featured acting awards for two admired and veteran stage performers, Reed Birney and Jayne Houdyshell, who play a married couple stressed by job loss, elder care and a challenge to their relationship.TOO CLOSE TO CALL: Two treasured American performers, Frank Langella and Jessica Lange, are in tight races. Mr. Langella, who has already won three Tony Awards, for Seascape, Fortunes Fool and Frost/Nixon, could win a fourth for his portrayal of a Frenchman with dementia in Florian Zellers The Father. But there is also significant support for Mark Strong, a British actor who made his Broadway debut in one of the great American stage roles: Eddie Carbone, a Brooklyn longshoreman with an unhealthy fixation on his niece, in A View From the Bridge.Ms. Lange, a two-time Oscar winner, has a slight edge in her bid for a first Tony, for her portrayal of the morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone in Long Days Journey into Night. But she could be upset by Lupita Nyongo, also an Oscar winner, making her Broadway debut as a girl captured by a Liberian warlord in Eclipsed.BEYOND THE HORSE RACE: The voters are all closely connected to the theater industry  they become voters as members of the Broadway League, which represents producers; the American Theater Wing; Actors Equity; and other groups made up of designers, directors, critics and more. So perhaps its not surprising that when we asked how they think Broadway is doing, they gave positive responses: 71 percent said Broadway is heading in the right direction; 61 percent said the variety of shows this past season was better than in previous seasons, and 59 percent said the quality of shows had improved.BIG PROBLEMS: It wasnt, however, all happiness and joy. We asked the voters about the challenges facing Broadway. A whopping 91 percent thought high ticket prices were a serious problem, and a plurality (43 percent) said they thought that issue was the biggest problem facing Broadway. (Note that we surveyed voters before Hamilton announced that it was raising its top premium price to $849.) But there was also concern about other issues: A majority thought the dependence on celebrities, the lack of audience for plays, the lack of audience for new work and congestion in Times Square were also serious problems.ABOUT THOSE HAMILTON TICKETS: A majority of Tony voters (58 percent) favored government action to restrict the ticket reselling that has driven up the price, but a slight majority (51 percent) also thought the producers of Hamilton need to do more to limit the reselling of tickets to that show.SO WHY WONT HAMILTON SET A RECORD? It has 16 nominations, but that includes three nominees for best featured actor and two for best leading actor. It can win only one in each category, so that means 13 possible wins, and it looks like its not going to win best leading actress, so that means a maximum of 12. Will it win 12? We dont know  the nominations include a number of design categories that are highly competitive, and we did not query voters about those categories, among others.

{"text": "TEL AVIV  For decades, American support for Israel has been strong  and bipartisan. Both Democratic and Republican voters typically see the Jewish state as a friend, rank the country favorably compared with others, and tend to support Israel over the Palestinians. Leaders of both parties regularly vow to maintain the United States-Israel alliance and to keep Israels security a priority.But many in Israel worry that this might be changing. And what worries them most is the Democratic Party.The change in tone and policy toward Israel began with President Obamas decision early on to move away from a 16-year tradition of unwavering support of Israel, and continued with his rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Bernie Sanderss campaign seems to prove that Mr. Obamas treatment of Israel might be a trend, not an aberration. Mr. Sanderss young, liberal supporters say they sympathize relatively more with Palestinians and less with Israel than older, more moderate Democrats do.Mr. Sanderss explicit views are not the problem. He has said that he is 100 percent pro-Israel in the sense of Israels right to exist. He has also said he wants peace and security for Israel. Like most Americans, he believes in a two-state solution. Like most Israelis, he opposes permanent Israeli control over Palestinians in the West Bank.The real problem is the sentiment. In April, Mr. Sanders appointed as a director for Jewish outreach a young woman who had called Mr. Netanyahu a vulgar epithet and described him as arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative. She was later suspended, but her appointment was not a fluke. The candidate consistently associates with people who feel the way she does. In May, he appointed two harsh critics of Israel  one of whom has accused Mr. Netanyahu of war crimes  to the committee that will write the Democratic Partys platform.Much like Mr. Obama when he ran for president in 2008, Mr. Sanders tries to distinguish support for Israel from his lack of support for the Israeli government. He treats Israels government as evil but sidesteps a fact: A majority of Israelis repeatedly voted for the parties that make up Mr. Netanyahus right-of-center coalitions, and back most of the policies to which Mr. Sanders objects. The right-wing government of Israel is also not a fluke.The good news for Israel is that Bernie Sanders wont be the Democratic presidential nominee. And Hillary Clintons tone toward Israel is much less troubling. Mrs. Clinton promises that the Democratic platform will reflect the longstanding strong support for Israel, and polls find that her supporters are more sympathetic to the country.But the bad news for Israel is that Mrs. Clinton alone cannot resist what seems to be a steady drift in her party. The more Democratic voters identify as liberal  and the more liberal they are  the less they support Israel. Political reality will ultimately catch up with Mrs. Clinton and other moderate Democrats. In Congress, a sidling away from Israel among Democrats may already be underway. Once, Democratic legislators had to worry about appearing unsupportive of Israel; today some of them  especially those who need to be re-elected by liberal voters  seem to have the opposite concern: They do not want to be seen as too supportive.Some high-ranking Israeli politicians tell me that they believe changes in Israels policy could quickly end Americans growing discontent with their country. Improved relations with the American Democrats, the anti-Netanyahu figures say, is one of the many rewards Israel will receive when it comes to its senses. For this to happen, they say, the government must demonstrate that it supports a two-state solution. But that is not an easy move for the current hard-line governing coalition.Soberer Israelis  and American conservatives  ridicule such suggestions because they believe the liberal constituency of the Democratic Party is moving leftward, toward a domain where condemnation of Israel is fashionable, and there is little Israel can do to reverse what is an American trend.It would not make much sense to most Israelis to elect their leaders based on the preferences of American Democrats. And Israels military cannot change its tactics to conform to the desires of Democratic voters, either. Similarly, it would not make sense for the Israeli government to surrender on diplomatic issues just to appease Democratic bleeding hearts.Or would it? Israel receives more American foreign aid than any other country, collaborates with Washington on security and intelligence matters and receives American diplomatic support at the United Nations and elsewhere. Because of this, Israel relies on support from both American political parties. And that comes with a price tag. The trick for Israel is to keep the price as low as possible while retaining its status as the United States special friend. Israel tries to do this whether a Republican like George W. Bush is in power, or (sometimes less successfully) when a Democrat like Barack Obama is in power.For relations between Israel and the Democrats to remain strong, one of two things needs to happen: Either Democrats attitudes and Israels policies must converge, or Democrats must become convinced that weakening support for Israel will come with a political price. Mr. Netanyahu and Mrs. Clinton will have to find out which it is to be, or else the drift will continue."}
{"text": "Its one of those questions youve probably thought about countless times since you were little. And, as you get older, the question can start to feel more real, especially when teachers, parents and even friends start asking.What do you want to be when you grow up?If you have it all figured out, then great. If not, then just be patient. Thats what Angela Duckworth advises recent college graduates in this article. She writes:For all their grandeur and euphoria, graduation ceremonies can be harrowing. Until that momentous day, youre a student whose job is to do what your teacher asks. Now you have to ask things of yourself  but what?If youre relying on a commencement speaker to set your compass, you may still be confused at days end. In my experience, its common to hear Follow your passion from the podium. This is great counsel if, in fact, you know what that passion is. But what if you dont?Young graduates might imagine that discovering your passion happens the way it does in a movie: with a flash of insight and a trumpet blast. Before that flash, you were struggling to find yourself, and in the next moment, you know exactly who you were meant to be.As a psychologist who studies world-class achievers, I can say the reality of following your passion is not very romantic. It takes time to develop a direction that feels so in-the-bones right that you never want to veer from it.Thus, my advice to young graduates is not to follow your passion but rather, to foster your passion.Ms. Duckworth then makes three recommendations:Students: Read the entire article, then tell us  What do you want to be when you grow up? Why? Do you know? Have you always known, at least since you were little? Or are you still looking for your passion, as Ms. Duckworth writes? And are you ever worried you wont find it? Do you think you will have a career that you love? Is that the most important quality youll look for in a job? Or do you think providing for your family or making enough money will trump your desire to enjoy your job? Are there other motivations that will help guide what kind of career you have  such as working toward social justice or following your religious beliefs? Do you have particular talents or skills that you think you should put to good use? What do you think about Ms. Duckworths advice? Have you already started to move toward what interests you, for example, by trying out different jobs, internships or volunteer opportunities?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below.

{"text": "BEIJING  In the fall of 2017, David Zwirner Gallery will open its first outpost in Asia in Hong Kong, the continents fast-growing hub for contemporary art.It will be the fourth location for the gallery, which is based in New York and has two spaces there and one in London. The 10,000-square-foot exhibition area is to be spread over the fifth and sixth floors of H Queens, a 24-story gallery and lifestyle tower under construction in the bustling Central district, and will open shortly after the building is completed.Speaking by telephone from New York, Mr. Zwirner said the gallery decided to open a space in Hong Kong based on its experience over the last few years participating in ART HK, a local art fair, and its successor, Art Basel Hong Kong.We have seen literally explosive growth in the interest for Western art among Asian collectors, he said. About two years ago, I had this moment, and I thought, Oh my God, if this is how people are learning and engaging, then weve got to have a gallery in the region. Mr. Zwirner said that although he and his associates considered other cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, with substantial concentrations of artists and collectors, Hong Kong was absolutely the clear choice.I love the European strain in Hong Kong, said Mr. Zwirner, a German-born dealer. There are still so many parallels to the way businesses are done in Britain in Hong Kong, and I can relate to that.More importantly, its a hub now for Asian collectors and curators, he said.Zwirner is following in the footsteps of other prominent Western galleries, like Gagosian Gallery and White Cube, that have established outposts in Hong Kong.Those earlier forays into the city were instructive, Mr. Zwirner said. In particular, it helped his staff realize the importance of finding a space that could accommodate large works of art  a formidable challenge in Hong Kong, where open interior space is a luxury.I dont expect any compromises, Mr. Zwirner said. If I go back to an artist and offer him or her a show, then I want them to be able to make exactly the kind of work that they want to make.Zwirner will be working with the New York architect Annabelle Selldorf to design the space, where the plan is to have ceilings about 13 feet high. Mr. Zwirner said the gallery would present about five to six exhibitions a year, initially focusing on artists currently on the Zwirner roster. They include Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Richard Serra and, most recently, William Eggleston.He added that the gallery was making a significant commitment to its Hong Kong branch, in terms of both finances and time.Im very optimistic, he said. I feel that more Western galleries will want to and have to arrive. Its hard to imagine that if you really think globally in your business that you cant be in Asia, and I think for the foreseeable future, that will be in Hong Kong."}
{"text": "UNITED NATIONS  The United Nations secretary general is supposed to answer to every nation on earth  and no nation at all.So the unusually frank admission by the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Thursday that he had essentially been coerced into removing a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen from an ignoble list of armies that kill and maim children was a rare window into the limits of his moral and political authority  and an object lesson for whoever succeeds Mr. Ban next year.On Thursday, Mr. Ban told reporters that he had been threatened with the loss of financing for humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, South Sudan and Syria if he did not temporarily delete the Saudi-led coalition from the list.The coalition has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilian and nonmilitary targets in its battle against Houthi rebels in Yemen for more than a year. The coalition, which is backed by the United States, has consistently denied the accusations.Mr. Bans office issued a report last week on violations of childrens rights in war zones, and it cited deadly coalition attacks that had hit schools and hospitals. By Monday, however, the coalition was taken off the list, after lobbying by Saudi Arabia and some of its wealthiest allies who help finance United Nations humanitarian operations.Mr. Ban offered his explanation Thursday, saying, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many U.N. programs.By the standards of mild-mannered diplomat-speak, he went on to issue an uncustomarily direct rebuke. It is unacceptable for member states to exert undue pressure, he said. The Saudi ambassador promptly asserted that there had been no undue pressure.Mr. Ban is wrapping up his 10-year tenure, and world powers are beginning to bargain over who his successor will be and just how independent she or he ought to be.Secretaries general have frequently faced intense political pressure from countries large and small, and Mr. Bans time in charge has been punctuated with a number of awkward compromises.Last summer, Mr. Ban reversed course on his list of armies and guerrilla groups that violated child rights in war. In that instance, his special representative for children and armed conflict, Leila Zerrougui, recommended that the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas be included on the list for their role in bombing schools and hospitals and otherwise breaking international law during the 50-day war in the Gaza Strip in 2014.Israel was consulted before the release of the report, Mr. Bans aides said at the time, and both Israeli and American diplomats lobbied intensely against the listing. In the end, both Israel and Hamas were kept off the list. Mr. Ban declined to address reporters questions on the matter at the time, leaving it to his envoy, Ms. Zerrougui, to explain the redaction.The generally risk-averse Mr. Ban has tried to step out a bit more during his last year, but he has also repeatedly had to step back.In March, on a rare visit to a camp that houses refugees from Western Sahara, Mr. Ban used the term occupation to refer to Moroccos 1975 annexation of territory that the Sahrawis claim as theirs. The Moroccan government responded by ejecting dozens of United Nations staff members, effectively kneecapping the peacekeeping mission there.Morocco has a powerful ally in France, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, which helps explain why the Security Council said nothing to persuade Morocco to reverse its decision. That left Mr. Ban on his own, and within days, his spokesman was compelled to swallow his words.We regret the misunderstandings and consequences that this personal expression of solicitude provoked, said the spokesman, Stphane Dujarric.Perhaps Mr. Bans most awkward moment came when he sought to act independently of the United States. In January 2014, he invited Iran to United Nations-brokered political negotiations over Syria, only to be advised by American officials to rescind the invitation, according to interviews with diplomats at the time.A day after he publicly announced the invitation, he appeared before reporters and said Iran could not attend. The State Department made its opposition clear, and demanded that Iran first accept certain conditions that it knew Tehran would find unacceptable. One of Mr. Bans aides said he felt betrayed.Asked at a news briefing on Thursday about Mr. Bans admission of Saudi pressure, a State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said, We agree with the secretary general that the U.N. should be permitted to carry out its mandate, carry out its responsibilities, without fear of money being cut off.Pressed about American threats to cut off funding, Mr. Toner said, Im aware of our own track record.Eleven people have so far declared their candidacy to succeed Mr. Ban when his term expires at the end of this year. A few others are expected to throw their names into the race in the next few weeks.The president of the General Assembly, Mogens Lykketoft, who has held the first-ever public hearings for the candidates, has used the terms independent and courageous to describe his ideal future secretary general.That may be unrealistic. It is really up to the five permanent members of the Security Council to choose the next head of the organization, and while many of them have said they want a strong secretary general, they have also avoided calling for one who is independent.As for the Saudi-led coalition, Mr. Ban said he would jointly review the claims made by his special representative, who accused the coalition of indiscriminate attacks against children. Privately, diplomats say such a review could drag on until it vanishes from public memory.Saudi Arabia flatly denied that it had exerted any pressure. No, of course not, the ambassador, Abdullah al-Mouallami, said in a telephone interview. It is not our style. It is not our culture. It is not our spirit to use threats or intimidation.He did say that he had met with Mr. Bans deputy, Jan Eliasson, a Swedish diplomat, on Monday and expressed his concerns about the listing. He said he told him that it would have an adverse impact on relations between Saudi Arabia and the United Nations."}
{"text": "A heady, sometimes headlong blend of fable and nightmare, with overtones of David Lynch and Franz Kafka and arresting wide-screen black-and-white images, Avishai Sivans second feature, Tikkun, is the latest evidence of the vitality of Israeli cinema, which has recently been moving away from politics-inflected realism in wilder, more allegorical directions. It is set within the insular world of Jerusalems Hasidic Jews, and also in a dream world of the directors own devising, a place where faith, skepticism and lust entwine in disturbing and surprising ways.Haim-Aaron (Aharon Traitel, a quietly intense nonprofessional actor) is a yeshiva student who spends his days in prayer and study, or maybe going quietly mad. Its hard to tell sometimes. And its also hard for Haim-Aaron or his family to know what to make of his recovery after a household accident that should  or might  have been fatal.Mr. Sivans method is to blur the lines between the literal, the fanciful and the metaphorical, so that the actual disemboweling of a steer (Haim-Aarons father works in a kosher slaughterhouse) seems to have the same ontological status as the appearance, in the familys toilet bowl, of a talking alligator.As the young mans religious and psychological crisis accelerates, Tikkun (a Hebrew word with complex theological and moral connotations) grows funnier and darker, without abandoning the empathy that saves it from excessive self-consciousness. Toward the end, the story begins to fray, and Mr. Sivan seems driven to find ever more extreme and provocative images. Haim-Aharons predicament threatens to become preposterous rather than haunting, but there is no denying the films uncanny power or its visual discipline. Its a luminous puzzle with a few pieces missing.Tikkun is not rated. It is in Hebrew and Yiddish, with English subtitles. Running time: two hours."}

The most recent finale was that nations most-watched television show of 2015 when it was broadcast in October. PBS, which aired two previous seasons of the show, will broadcast Britains Season 6 in the United States and call it Season 3. Additional seasons of the series will premiere on PBS over the next two years.What it lacks in vitriolic chefs and dramatic competitors common to American cooking competitions, The Great British Baking Show makes up for in earnestness and charm. A dozen amateur bakers offer pleasant backstories (and do their best to maintain stiff upper lips) while toiling over mixers and ovens in a tent at the Downton Abbey-esque Welford Park in Berkshire.But the very British-sounding confections are the real stars of this Bafta-winning series. Be warned: Episode 8s flaky, puff pastry horns, filled with rose pistachio and mocha hazelnut buttercream frostings, will make you want to lick the screen.The first season of The Great British Baking Show, known as The Great British Bake Off in Britain, is available on Netflix and the first two seasons are available on PBS.org for PBS members."}
{"text": "RENTING out your house or apartment, or even a room in your home, may seem an easy way to make some money or help pay for your own summer vacation, now that online rental hubs make it simple to market your property. But its worth learning about the tax rules that may apply to avoid costly surprises next April.To keep things simple, consider limiting the number of days you rent your home, or a room in your home, to no more than 14 a year. If you rent out your home for fewer than 15 days, you dont have to pay federal income tax on the money you earn. In fact, you dont even have to report the income to the Internal Revenue Service, said Jonah Gruda, senior tax manager with WeiserMazars in New York.It doesnt matter if you make $400, $4,000 or more; the money is tax-free. (At least, its free of federal income tax. More later on other types of taxes that may apply.)The tax exemption  one of the rare times you can earn money and not pay any income tax on it  is called the Masters rule by some because it is used by those who rent out their houses in Augusta, Ga., during the professional golf tournament. But it can benefit anyone living near a major event, like the Super Bowl or the Kentucky Derby. This summer, those with homes near the major political conventions  to be held in Cleveland for the Republicans, and Philadelphia for the Democrats  could potentially reap a rental windfall.The 14 days dont have to be consecutive, said Bob Meighan, the vice president of customer advocacy for TurboTax. So you dont necessarily need to live near a large, one-time event to take advantage of the exemption. You can also rent for a day or two here and there and pay no taxes, as long as the total is fewer than 15 days. It is one of the best tax benefits available, for those who know about it, Mr. Meighan said.Here are some questions and answers about tax rules when renting your home:If I rent my home for 14 days or less, can I deduct any expenses I incur?You cant deduct direct costs, like utilities, that result from the rental, Mr. Gruda said. But if you usually take a deduction for home mortgage interest and property taxes, you can continue to take that on your tax return.What if I rent out my home for 15 days or more?Once you exceed the 14-day limit  even if its just by one day  the two-week exemption goes away. All the money you made must be reported and will be subjected to income tax. Theres no give or take on that one, Mr. Meighan said.In that case, however, you can reduce the tax you owe by deducting related rental expenses, like cleaning fees, repairs and the like, said Amy Wang, senior technical manager for tax advocacy at the American Institute of CPAs. Since the rental is now considered a business, both the income and the deductions would be reported on Schedule E. It can be complex, she said, so keep good records of all your expenses.Do I have to pay local taxes on money I earn by renting my home?Short-term rentals  typically, those of 30 days or fewer  are often subject to state and local lodging or transient occupancy taxes. You may have to pay these taxes, usually based on a percentage of the rental fee, even if you dont owe income taxes. Check with your local, county or state government to see what rules apply in your area."}
{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this article, the Metro reporter Winnie Hu describes her excitement and trepidation about going behind closed doors at 520 First Avenue, the headquarters of the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.The city morgue was less creepy than I imagined.Yes, there were dead bodies everywhere. But they were mostly hidden from view, zipped into body bags and neatly tagged. There was little to suggest the violence and misfortune that had landed some of them in this subterranean warren of rooms.Even the autopsies were not so bad. Medical examiners outfitted in scrubs, aprons, masks and gloves matter-of-factly dissected bodies in a sterile white room. The radio played in the background, and technicians chatted animatedly as they rolled bodies in and out. There was a surprising sense of normalcy to it all.We see so much tragedy here, you have to keep a good attitude, or it would be overwhelming, explained Jeff Spielman, a forensic photographer.As a reporter for the Metro section, I had caught glimpses before of bodies, and body parts, at murder scenes and train crashes, among other places. But I had worried that in a morgue I would be surrounded by bodies, too close to ignore the blood and gore. In the end, curiosity beat out trepidation when I was invited to see firsthand how the city trains medical examiners.For years, I had walked by the headquarters of the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner at 520 First Avenue, a short, brick building in the shadow of the gleaming towers of New York University Langone Medical Center. What was it like inside, I wondered. From the outside, it looked small and unimpressive. Its name out front was nearly unreadable, with missing letters, like a word on Wheel of Fortune.In the lobby, silver block letters on the wall behind the reception desk spell out a phrase, in Latin, that translates roughly to: This is the place where the dead help the living.The agency is one of the largest and busiest medical examiners offices in the nation, performing about 5,000 autopsies a year for deaths that are deemed sudden, violent or unexpected. Now, to peel back the curtain on the work it does, the office had taken the unusual step of granting The Times access to its mortuaries and work areas over several months.I had seen autopsies performed on crime shows like C.S.I. over the years. The reality was much different, of course. It was messier, for one thing: I had dreaded seeing blood; but far more gruesome, as it turned out, was the greenish fluid that drips out of decomposing bodies. The smell was worse than the worst body odor on a sweltering summer day.The first time I watched an autopsy at the morgue, Dr. Barbara Sampson, the citys chief medical examiner, rolled over a stool in case I felt faint. People have hit the floor hard, she said. Although the stool proved unnecessary, I did look away when I heard the whir of an electric saw that would soon open a skull.I also learned that autopsies were more physically demanding than the crime shows let on. One day, I followed Dr. Jacqueline Nunez, 34, who spent the past year training as a medical examiner. She had been on her feet for more than six hours, working on three autopsies back to back without a break. She pulled and pushed heavy bodies twice her size. She leaned over them with scalpels and knives, pushing down with all her weight.Just watching was tiring. You build endurance, she told me. You pick up stamina and you get used to it. Thats what this year is for.Another thing the crime shows gloss over is the uncertainty of the work. Many autopsies yield only clues  not answers  about what happened to someone. Medical examiners can spend weeks, even months, following up with lab tests, researching scientific literature and interviewing family members and police detectives. Even then, there may never be an answer. Medical examiners sometimes refer to those cases as undetermined squared  when both the cause and the manner of death cannot be identified.Dr. Stephen Melito, 32, a father of two who also trained as a medical examiner this year, said he felt that the crime shows had created some misunderstandings. They dont give us guns, he said. Were not going out arresting people. Thats not our job.Instead, Dr. Melito said he saw himself as simply the final doctor in a persons life, the one who explains death, answers questions and tries to offer comfort to those left behind: You provide a service to the city and to the legal system, but most of all you provide a service to the families in arguably the most difficult time of their life."}

He also said Mr. Sanders might be traveling back to campaign in Washington before its primary.Mr. Sanders may be staying in the race to pressure the Democratic Party to inject more progressive ideals  like the call for a $15 federal minimum wage  into the Democratic platform at the national convention next month.Meanwhile, he did not utter Mrs. Clintons name at a Thursday night rally he held in Washington, and he has not commented on Mrs. Clintons new endorsements."}
{"text": "This article originally appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 25, 1964.Once upon a time, a loud and charming young heavyweight contender named Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. had a recurring daydream. He would win the championship, the richest single prize in all sport, and immediately grow a beard, put on a pair of tattered bluejeans, and saunter down a country lane until he found a pretty little girl. They would dance in the meadows and splash through the brooks, and fall in love. Then he would reveal himself as the heavyweight king in disguise, and carry her back to his $250,000 home, his Cadillacs, his world fame, and say, This is all yours, because you love me for what I am.Eight months ago, Cassius X, a newly avowed disciple of the separatist movement called the Black Muslims, won the championship. His seventh-round technical knockout of Sonny Liston amazed the public (especially at odds of 7 to 1), initiated a Senate investigation and provoked several boxing groups to a flurry of charges and threats. On Nov. 16, in Boston, a subdued and often wearyingly dogmatic Muhammad Ali (the name was bestowed on him by the Muslim leadership a few days after his fight with Liston) will defend his championship in a rematch with Liston. Whether he wins the fight or not (again, the betting odds are against him), Ali will probably remain, for a long time, the most controversial and complex figure in modern American sports history. He has long since passed the brash Cassius Clay who burst upon boxing on the wings of bad poetry and brilliant publicity; he has even passed the convert Cassius X who could only say of his new religions leader: If every tree was full of ink, you couldnt write all that Elijah Muhammad knows.He is married now, to a woman with a child by a previous marriage; he has been rejected by the Army for reasons not fully explained; he has traveled to Africa and returned to state: Im not an American. Im a black man. And he has sweepingly denounced American Negroes in the civil rights movement as people who secretly think: Im gonna get me a light-skinned girl, nearest to white I can find, and a long cigarette and a fancy car and I wont associate with those blacks.But somewhere among these Cassius Clays  the lovable clown; Cassius X, the troubled and searching man; Muhammad Ali, the sociopolitical spokesman  is the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound, cherubically handsome 22-year-old paradox who, within minutes, can be clown, thinker, spokesman, or any combination of his public roles.There was a day in September, for example, at a Boston motel, when Ali walked into a battery of television lights for the signing ceremony of the second fight with Liston. In sports, the public signing of contracts is merely a publicity gimmick. Everybody smiles, does a little verbal soft-shoe if he can, and hopes that no sudden international crisis will push the footage out of the evening news programs. Ali was surrounded by half a dozen tight-lipped, roving-eyed members of the Boston Muslim temple, and his full lower lip hung sulkily. Hey, Cassius! yelled a television cameraman. The name is Muhammad Ali, mumbled the champion, tiredly. O.K., Ollie, O.K., how about a little Im the greatest, Ill beat the Bear in two, huh? Ali stared at the cameraman and he mumbled: Most of my campaigning was not really me. Now, I dont have to talk like that. I see Robert Kennedy walking through the streets meeting everybody, shaking everybodys hands, and when he gets into office you gonna need a necktie to go and see him.There was a day last July, when he was riding through Harlem in his chauffeur-driven, air-conditioned limousine, speaking with the pompous sobriety of an elder statesman about his recent tour of Africa as an Ambassador of the American branch of Islam. He spoke softly of his meetings with Nasser and Nkrumah, of his tumultuous welcome in Ghana of the 2,500-pound block of a 4,000-year-old Egyptian pyramid he had been given. Suddenly his eyes lit up, and he began to talk faster.The world watches me now, hey, you know what happened on the way to Egypt? I sat with the pilot, thats right, the pilot of a big jet plane, and he talked to me about boxing while he drove the plane, and I sat behind a wheel, too, and whenever he turned his wheel, my wheel turned, too, and I could sit there and pretend I was driving the plane. Then it was time to land, and thats a crucial time, and I stayed in the pilots room, but went to another seat, and I was right there when we landed in a place where most people dont even get a chance to peek.There was a day in March, in a suite at the Hotel Theresa littered with cardboard containers from Chock Full o Nuts and the bodies of hangers-on, that Ali sat for seven hours and spoke methodically about his religion. Its natural that the American Negro should have a Muslim nature. Those bombings, and they never caught the people who did it. The Civil Rights Bill having all that trouble and all those people talking so it dont come to a vote, and Kennedy did so much for the Negro and he died. Things die on out and our people forget. Three hundred and ten years of physical slavery, the faithful slave I see on a corner in Harlem and he has to ask for a dollar cause hes hungry. All our lives we learn that black is evil, its dirty, they even call black cake devils food cake, and now we learn in our Muslim temples that the richest dirt and the strongest coffee is black. So Muslim fits us like a glove.There was Feb. 26, the day after he beat Liston, and he turned coldly on a public waiting to watch him bounce with the new joy of being the best of the biggest prizefighters in the world. I dont have to be what you want me to be, he said. Im free to be who I want.Speaking almost by rote, he told an uncomfortable, frequently argumentative and wholly unprepared news conference that I want to be with my own kind.In the jungle, lions are with lions, and tigers with tigers, and redbirds with redbirds, and bluebirds with bluebirds. Thats human nature, too. I dont want to go where Im not wanted. There all the days when he petulantly snaps, I know what Im doing, at someone who questions him, and later will say, Im just living from day to day, preparing for the hereafter  no, I dont know where Im going next.And, of course, there were all the days back in Louisville, Ky., when he ran alongside the school bus so that people would notice him, and all the Sundays when, quiet, humble and a Christian, he walked out of church and flinched because the white people still looked at me like I was dirty.The champ is an individualist, theres no cycle or pattern in what he does, says Angelo Dundee, his trainer and the white man who has spent the most time with him. But Ill say this  hes one of the most dedicated and hardest-working fighters Ive ever seen. Hes still growing and he could wind up being one of the greatest heavyweights that ever lived.Dundee first saw Clay in Louisville in 1959. Dundee had brought one of his many fighters to town for a bout, and the two men were lounging in their hotel room when the phone rang. This is Cassius Clay, the next heavyweight champion, talking. Im gonna win the Olympics and be heavyweight champ. Im in the lobby. Can I come up?Even at 15 he was big and fast and strong. He would work out with Dundees fighters when they came through town., and according to Willie Pastrano, now the light-heavyweight champion, the young Clay often made him look bad in sparring sessions. An indifferent high school student, Clay was a superb diplomat. Sometimes he would spar with the opponent of Dundees fighter as well, and tell both boxers they were going to win.In 1960, Clay won the national Golden Gloves heavyweight title in Madison Square Garden, and the light-heavyweight championship at the Rome Olympics. Swelling with pride for himself and for his newfound belonging within a team of Americans, he returned to Louisville. When I got there I found nothing had changed, he says vaguely, refusing to pursue the subject because he doesnt want to name names or embarrass people. But according to someone who was close to him, there was at least one incident that pricked at his newfound manhood. He was walking down a Louisville street when a large car pulled alongside and a white man leaned out. Hey boy, hey, you boy, get on over heah, the man shouted. Ah want yoah autograph.Under the sponsorship of 11 local businessmen-sportsmen who guaranteed him expenses and a salary, Cassius turned professional in 1960. Dundee felt that Clay had not only the potential to become a heavyweight champion, but natural instincts of extroversion and love of attention that would produce ballyhoo all along the way to the top. The first few years of the Louisville Lip are documented by thousands of pictures of a bright-eyed youngster with his mouth wide open, and millions of words of which I am the greatest, no, Im the double-greatest are among the more compelling.Dundee had had years of experience with colorless fighters who said, Ill do my talking in the ring, and he encouraged and even prodded the river-mouth to keep flowing. A lot of it was conscious promotion, and most of the poetry was awful, but every bit was fun, for Cassius and for an amused public. There was attention from adults, adulation from children (with whom he has that special rapport of the extravagantly absurd) and many, many girls (the desirable ones were classified, in descending order, as queens, princesses and foxes).Even as the clown grew famous, there were incidents to hasten the growth of the potential convert to Islam. He marched in a civil-rights demonstration, and someone in the crowd threw hot water on him. I saw people marching for freedom and they come back with knots on their heads. They go into a restaurant and beg for a cup of coffee and not get it, and sit there, and know theyre not wanted, and dont know whats going to happen to them, and sit there and not even like the music on the jukebox.Boxing was in bad shape, even worse than usual. Floyd Patterson, a moody, sensitive introvert, was the champion, and his challengers included an amateur, an inadequate Texas hillbilly, a human windmill who lost the power to defend himself and a Swede who beat Patterson once, lost twice and went home with his money. Most of the other boxers around had no real drawing appeal, were banned in one state or another for alleged racket affiliations or were considered too tough for Patterson, by his manager. Liston was banned in some states and was too tough, but he was the only fighter who might bring a big gate. Clay, meanwhile, was coming along, winning every professional fight, and often predicting the round he would knock out an opponent. His credentials as a possible contender were excellent: he was not taken seriously as a fighter, and the most antisocial things he did were sketching rocket ships on restaurant linen and leaping out of closets yelling, Boo! at Dundee.It was not until Nov. 15, 1962, in his 16th professional bout, that Clay registered his first important victory. He knocked out Archie Moore, fading but still glamorous, in the fourth round, as he had predicted in doggerel. Wherever he went, Clay filled the arena. People came to see the braggart knocked out (said Clay), or because they hoped this handsome, honest youngster would win and save the sport (said his management) or because he had brought back personal color to boxing (said the promoters).During this period, everyone who came in contact with him, socially or through business, said  without qualification  that he liked Clay. Liston won the title from Patterson, and the pace of Clays preparation for a title shot was quickened. In 1963, he fought and won three times, each adding immeasurably to the Clay legend. At the weigh-in for the Charlie Powell fight, Clay became unmanageable, challenged Powell to a fight at the scales, started screaming, You wait and see, youll go in three, and had to be restrained. It was a carefully conceived dress rehearsal for a similar mad scene staged at the weigh-in for the Liston fight. Powell went in three.Malcolm X was in Miami before the fight, and Clay shared his free time between the Muslim leader and his own entourage at a rambling house filled with laughter, pranks and rented Hollywood movies. The rumor grew that Clay was Muslim. Later, he said: The pressure didnt really start until I flew up to be with Malcolm a few weeks before the fight, and then he came to Miami, and into the gym, and the trainers and everybody was shook up. Even the fight was threatened. They told me they would cancel the fight if I didnt renounce my religion. I got my X four weeks before the fight. The they has never been identified, although it was reported at the time that the promoters felt that Miamis largely Jewish population would stay away from a fight involving a Muslim. It was partly true, and partly an alibi: the tickets were terribly overpriced, and badly scaled. Right up until the moment Cassius X stepped into the ring, rumors flew that he had left the country. At the weigh-in, during which Cassius raved and ranted and practically foamed, a commission doctor reported his pulse at an abnormally high 120 and irresponsibly said that the fighter was scared to death.This was generally accepted, and when Cassius was nowhere to be found an hour before the fight, it was assumed he was either catatonic or gone. Actually, he was standing very quietly in a corner of the arena, watching his brother Rudy win his first professional fight. Then Cassius went out and won his 20th. Clays victory in Miami Beach was also his first tangible defeat as an appealing public image, in this country at least. The anger toward Liston for quitting with an injured shoulder muscle was the expression of a public that wanted Clay to lose.I cant understand it, said Ali, sometime later. I didnt go with white women, I dont smoke, I dont go where Im not wanted. And still I catch all this hell. Why? I can go to a Roman Catholic church and bow to all their idols and statues, and I can go into the Holy Roller and pound the drums and yell, and nobodyll say nothing. But as soon as I go to the Muslim meeting, where everybody is clean and righteous, everyone else is jumping. Why?Part of the reason must be the traditional role that the sporting world demands a hero to play. Clay violated the code. As long as he was amusing, his immodesties could be tolerated. Once he started to jerk fans back to the problems of the real world he became a spoiler of the daydream that sports is a never-never land where motivation is uncomplicated and a result is final and pure. Who, after all, was Cassius Clay if he could be Cassius X? And whats in a name like Muhammad Ali? Ahmed Mali, Mamud Wally, whos that? taunted Liston on that contract signing day last month in Boston. I met you as Cassius Clay and Ill leave you as Cassius Clay.And for the first time that afternoon, todays heavyweight champion of the world grinned. First his eyes lit up, and then they closed, and he rested his head on his shoulder, which shook slightly with laughter as he snored as loudly as he could."}
{"text": "Morton White, a philosopher and historian of ideas whose innovative theory of holistic pragmatism showed the way toward a more socially engaged, interdisciplinary role for philosophy, died on May 27 in Skillman, N.J. He was 99.His death was announced by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where he had taught from 1970 until his retirement in 1987.Mr. White was best known to generations of history and philosophy undergraduates as the editor of two standard classroom texts. The first was The Age of Analysis (1955), an anthology of writings from key 20th-century philosophers, for which he supplied an introduction and commentary.The second, edited with his wife, the sociologist Lucia White, was The Intellectual Versus the City: From Thomas Jefferson to Frank Lloyd Wright (1962). It surveyed the conflicted American attitudes about the merits of rural and urban life.As a philosopher, Professor White was identified with holistic pragmatism, an effort to rescue philosophy from what he saw as the narrow preoccupations of the dominant analytic movement, with its parsings of statements and the constituent parts of complex notions. There are many signs that the sleeping giant of philosophy is arousing itself out of its mathematical slumbers, he wrote in Religion, Politics and the Higher Learning (1959).Building on the work of Willard Van Orman Quine and Nelson Goodman, Professor White conceived of pragmatic analysis as an all-embracing venture incorporating ethics, politics and the social sciences.In my view, holistic pragmatism is a theory that may be applied to all disciplines that seek truth, he wrote in one of the essays in his collection From a Philosophical Point of View: Selected Studies (2005).Professor White explored his ideas in strictly philosophical works like Toward Reunion in Philosophy (1956) and in sweeping intellectual histories, including Social Thought in America: The Revolt Against Formalism (1949), a study of John Dewey, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Thorstein Veblen and other thinkers, and Science and Sentiment in America: Philosophical Thought From Jonathan Edwards to John Dewey (1972).In an obituary on the website of the Institute for Advanced Study, Stanley N. Katz, a historian at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, called Professor White philosophys ambassador to history and the humanities.He was born Morton Gabriel Weisberger on April 29, 1917, in Manhattan to Robert Weisberger and the former Esther Levine and grew up on the Lower East Side, where his family owned a shoe store.Morton excelled in school, first at P.S. 114 and later at Seward Park High School (he graduated at 15), but felt little in the way of intellectual stirrings.I was a child of the streets and the store, he wrote in his memoir, A Philosophers Story, published in 1999. I was a lonely, unreligious child who knew little about what is sometimes called the spiritual life, little about books, and much about movies, sports, restaurants, prizefighters, baseball players and politics.The shoe store went bankrupt during the Depression, and he enrolled in City College, which was tuition-free. He absorbed radical politics and initially set his sights on becoming a lawyer. He drifted gradually toward philosophy after taking an introductory survey course and plunging into the study of logic.I could solve the problems of the world while I had fun and learned how to earn a living, he wrote in his memoir.After graduating in 1936 with a bachelors degree in social science, he abandoned the idea of studying law. Columbia University lent him the money to enroll in its graduate school, where he wrote a thesis on the pragmatist and logician C. S. Peirce and earned a masters degree in 1938.For his doctorate, which he received in 1942, he wrote about Deweys early thought, specifically his theory that ideas are not a mirror of reality but a plan of action. It was published in 1943 as The Origins of Deweys Instrumentalism.In 1949, he married Lucia Perry. She died in 1996. His second wife, the former Helen Starobin, died in 2012. He is survived by his sons, Nicholas and Stephen; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.While teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor White became friends with Mr. Goodman, whose theories on hypotheses and inductive reasoning influenced him decisively. A second, even more powerful influence was Mr. Quine, whom he met after joining Harvards philosophy department in 1948.Mr. Quine proposed a holistic approach to understanding how human beings test beliefs against experience  not one by one, but as an interconnected system of beliefs. He had applied this insight to natural sciences and logic, but Professor White extended it to religion, history, art and morality.He addressed these problems in a seminal essay published in 1950, The Analytic and the Synthetic: An Untenable Dualism, and at greater length in Toward Reunion in Philosophy, which he dedicated to Mr. Goodman and Mr. Quine. He later refined his theories in Religion, Politics and the Higher Learning (1959), Foundations of Historical Knowledge (1965), What Is and What Ought to Be Done: An Essay on Ethics and Epistemology (1981) and A Philosophy of Culture: The Scope of Holistic Pragmatism (2002).He also edited Paths of American Thought (1963), with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and Documents in the History of American Philosophy (1972)."}
{"text": "They hit the wire together in a blur, two gray horses that had shown promise on their way to the Kentucky Derby but once beneath those iconic twin spires looked as if they hardly belonged in Americas greatest race. Maybe they had excuses.The colt named Destin had broken poorly that day and was roughed up early in the race, and Creator, who had closed like a freight train in the Arkansas Derby, barely lifted a hoof in Kentucky, clunking down the track as if wearing concrete shoes.It was not a hard decision for the trainer Todd Pletcher to bring Destin home to his barn here in New York and start over. It was a no-brainer for Steve Asmussen to try to retool Creator at Churchill Downs, where he perennially leads the trainers standings.As the placing judges puzzled over a too-close-to-call rush to the finish of the 148th running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, each trainer remained on edge. One of them was going to look smart, the other not smart enough. Those in the grandstand clutching betting tickets on the long-shot grays were confessing their sins and saying their prayers: Destin went off at odds of nearly 9-1 and Creator at 16-1.All, however, were in better spirits than the trainer Keith Desormeaux and his rider and brother, Kent, who saw the heavily favored Exaggerator first stall, then sputter at the top of stretch, ending his bid to take two-thirds of the Triple Crown. The colt that had vanquished the Kentucky Derby champ Nyquist in the Preakness was nowhere near when the real running started.In the clubhouse, Kenny Troutt, the owner of WinStar Farm, was balancing thoughts of a Belmont Stakes that he lost two years ago, and a decision that he had made earlier in the week. In the 2014 Belmont, his colt named Commissioner hit the midstretch looking every bit of the winner, but he was run down and beaten by a head by Tonalist.In Creator, however, Troutt had a late-running horse who turned in his optimal performances when a fast pace softened up the front-runners. So Troutt met with his WinStar brain trust and decided to enter a swift front-runner by the name of Gettysburg  a rabbit, in the parlance of the racetrack.We needed a fast pace, and then Creator could run his race, said Troutt, who had watched his colt come from 10 lengths back to win the Arkansas Derby.It was tricky, though. Troutt had to take Gettysburg from the barn of Pletcher, one of his main trainers (in fact, they won the 2010 Derby together), and give him to Asmussen to enter in the Belmont. Troutt knew that Pletcher already had Destin and Stradivari, another contender, in the race.It was not an easy decision, Troutt said. I felt like it was the right thing to do was to realign the camps because Todd had the second and third choice in the race, and I just felt like it would be easier on him to answer to his other owners; it would be easier on us if we realign the camp for this race.Pletcher became one of the nations leading trainers by keeping powerful owners happy so his large, high-quality stable remains that way. This time it cost him a third Belmont Stakes victory.Gettysburgs rider, Paco Lopez, gunned his colt to the lead and laid down testing fractions of 48.48 seconds for a half-mile and 1 minute 13.28 seconds for three-quarters, a pace that more often than not wobbles the legs of horses trying Belmonts mile-and-a-half distance for the first and usually last time.Through a mile, the pace thinned the ranks of front-running challengers, who did not include Nyquist, who was withdrawn weeks ago because of illness. Governor Malibu and Stradivari could not keep up. And Exaggerator? He feigned a move coming around the turn.I put him down for a mad drive and said, show me your stuff, but there was nothing there, said Kent Desormeaux, who wrapped up the Preakness winner and allowed him to galumph home in 11th place.Through a mile, Javier Castellano, aboard Destin, had waited patiently for Lopez and Gettysburg to run out of gas. When they did, he shot past them like a bullet train and set Destins gaze on the finish line.Behind him, however, Irad Ortiz Jr. had Creator in full flight. They had been blasting past horses two at a time and were bounding down the middle of the stretch as if skipping from one trampoline to another.When we got clear, he started running, Ortiz said.In the clubhouse, Asmussen had watched Ortiz save yards by deftly slicing through openings without having to slow Creator down. Now he knew that it was going to be a matter of inches if his colt was going to pass the Test of the Champion, as this grueling marathon is known. Creator pulled alongside Destin, and they matched strides for 10, 20, 30 yards.Asumussens counterpart, Pletcher, meanwhile, was alternating between his binoculars and watching the video board, hoping the wire would get there. Soon. It did not. Ortiz extended his arms once, twice, and with a final surge got past Castellano and Destin by a nose.Pletchers onetime horse Gettysburg had done his job well enough to deprive him of another Belmont Stakes to go along with the ones he had earned in 2007 with Rags to Riches and in 2013 with Palace Malice.Tough beat, Pletcher said stoically.It was WinStar and Asmussen who looked like geniuses, bringing home an $800,000 first-place check to boost the colts earnings past $1.5 million. His final time of 2.28.51 was good enough to deliver a $34.80 win ticket to those who risked $2 on him.He was the perfect horse by inches, Asmussen said. Thats how you have to be on big race days."}
{"text": "In this era of global warming, when there is extreme weather like the recent heavy rains that led to flooding in Paris and other parts of France and Germany, the question inevitably comes up: Did climate change play a role?Not too long ago, the immediate response from most climate scientists would be that while it is generally accepted that global warming will lead to more rain because warmer air can hold more moisture, it is difficult to attribute any one event to climate change. A more detailed answer, perhaps with a definitive conclusion, would come months or years later in a paper published in a peer-reviewed journal.But scientists in Europe have much more rapidly assessed the role of climate change in the European floods, when parts of France got a months worth of rain in a few days in late May.Their conclusion is that climate change made the flooding in France far more likely. But they were unable to draw a conclusion about Germany.The researchers, from a group called World Weather Attribution that is coordinated by the climate-change research organization Climate Central, used similar approaches to the methods employed by longer peer-reviewed studies. This includes analyzing historical temperatures for the region and running many computer simulations with regional climate models, including some in which it is assumed there is no human-caused climate change.For an extreme three-day rain event like the one that occurred in France, the scientists best estimate was that global warming increased the probability of such a deluge by 80 percent for the Seine River basin (which includes Paris, where the river rose about 20 feet above normal) compared with a world where the climate was not changing.For the Loire River basin, to the south and west of Paris, the best estimate was a 90 percent greater likelihood. For both regions, the researchers said, they had high confidence that there was at least a 40 percent greater likelihood of a three-day deluge because of climate change.In Germany, even though the rains were caused by the same meteorological conditions  essentially a zone of low-pressure air that stalled over the region  the rains tended to come in shorter, more intense bursts, said Heidi Cullen, chief scientist at Climate Central.So in their analysis of Germany, the researchers looked at the likelihood of one-day extreme events, but their analysis found no consistent link to climate change.The study by the team, which includes scientists from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, Oxford University and other institutions, will soon be submitted for peer review and eventual publication in a journal. But the group has embraced this rapid-response approach as a way of increasing public awareness of the effects of climate change.After every event like this, theres a lot of speculation in the media about whether climate change is responsible, Dr. Cullen said. The scientific community has the responsibility, and the tools, to analyze these things objectively."}
{"text": "DHAKA, Bangladesh  More than 3,000 people, some of them known Islamist militants, have been arrested in a series of police raids intended to quell a wave of deadly machete attacks against bloggers, minorities and others, the police said Saturday.The roundup began last week after militants killed the wife of a police superintendent who had been investigating the machete attacks. Over the course of the week, the police said, they killed five militants in shootouts. They were members of the Jamaatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, one of two groups that the authorities believe are behind most of the attacks, the police said.Many citizens criticized the government for not taking action sooner against the militants, who have created a climate of terror since they began murdering secularist bloggers and others more than three years ago.Since 2013, bloggers, freethinkers, religious minorities, foreigners, gay activists, followers of more liberal strains of Islam and others have been killed in attacks carried out mostly by groups of young men wielding machetes.The government had previously arrested dozens of people involved in at least 40 such attacks, but until this past week had not carried out a nationwide crackdown. People close to the government said leaders were hesitant to clamp down for fear of alienating radical fundamentalists, who form a large voting bloc.I welcome this special drive. It should have been taken much earlier, said Shahriar Kabir, the general secretary of the South Asian Peoples Union Against Fundamentalism and Communalism. The police believe Mr. Kabir was one of the militants top targets, and he leaves his house here only with police protection.But the leading opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, accused the government of using the crackdown as an excuse to round up opponents.In the name of an antimilitant drive, the government is arresting opposition activists, including B.N.P. and other antigovernment people, said Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, the partys senior joint secretary general.A. K. M. Kamrul Ahsan, a Bangladeshi police spokesman, said that the crackdown began Friday at 6 a.m., and that within 24 hours more than 3,000 suspects had been arrested nationwide.Five members of the Islamist group Jamaatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh were killed in shootouts with the police during the week, including one militant wanted in connection with the killing of a doctor last year and another who was suspected of shooting up a Shiite mosque during evening prayers last year, the police said.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, speaking at a meeting of her Awami League party committee on Saturday, vowed that the killers would be hunted down. Ms. Hasina also suggested that opposition parties had been involved in the killings of the bloggers and others.In addition to local groups, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for some of the killings on social media, and several attacks have been claimed by a faction of Al Qaeda on the Indian subcontinent."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  A university archaeologist, a city librarian, a genealogist and even a psychic are trying to solve the mystery of the little girl in the coffin.Last month, a construction crew unearthed a small cast-iron coffin in a neighborhood here that once housed a cemetery. Thousands of the citys dead were removed in the early 1900s when politicians and developers pushed for more housing. During the disinterment project, a 37-inch coffin with curved glass windows was left behind.Inside the coffin was the body of a perfectly preserved child about 3 years old, wearing a white embroidered dress with a bow and a cross of lavender on her chest. Rose petals and eucalyptus leaves lay beside her.In todays more complex world, where a girl killed by a stray bullet might receive a few tweets, this mystery of a child long gone has garnered international coverage.At a ceremony last weekend, the little girl in the coffin was nested into a larger coffin of handmade cherrywood and buried in Colma, a necropolis for San Franciscos dead, where others from the Odd Fellows Cemetery were reinterred. Mothers and their daughters, parents with small children and older couples came, they said, because they were touched by the little girls story. We felt for her getting left behind, said Heather Reynolds, who came with her mother, Barbara. We wanted to give her a nice send-off, she said.Engraved on a small headstone was the name Miranda Eve, given to her by the young children who live in the house where the coffin was found and a city administrator who helped arrange the burial. The back of the headstone was left blank, so that if the girls true identity is discovered, her name can be added.Before her second burial, a few strands of the girls hair were removed for analysis. Jelmer Eerkens, a University of California, Davis, archaeologist who is more accustomed to working with materials from ancient peoples along the Nile or from Native Americans in California, offered to investigate.I read they were planning to just rebury the body without any analysis, he said. As an archaeologist, I thought, thats not right. At some point, these things from the past become our collective heritage.All human societies recognize the importance of ancestry and history, Dr. Eerkens said. But rather than a general story about war and history, this is a story about an individual person. People can understand and connect with how sad it must have been to lose a young daughter.Dr. Eerkens, who specializes in isotope analysis, said a strand of hair is like a tree ring. By using a mass spectrometer, he said, well be able to learn from the moment she died and going back in time, maybe in two-week to one-month intervals, where she was living because of the food and water that gets incorporated into hair.In the 1800s, people generally ate food available in their immediate environs. Also, there are slight differences in the composition of water, which enables archaeologists to determine a biochemical signature of where someone is from, Dr. Eerkens said.If her DNA survived, and if genealogists can determine the little girls name, he said, it might offer us the possibility to track down modern descendants of this person.Dr. Eerkens said he does not expect to be able to determine the cause of the little girls death.The small coffin was found in early May in the backyard of Ericka Karners home in the Richmond district in the northern part of the city. Ms. Karner, who grew up in the Spanish-style stucco house, said part of her was not surprised by the discovery. The house was built in 1938 atop what had once been the Odd Fellows Cemetery, and the citys residents living on old cemetery properties occasionally still find bone fragments, chipped marble and, sometimes, even headstones in their yards.In the late 1800s, San Francisco politicians, backed by aggressive land developers, campaigned to rid the city of its sprawling cemeteries. According to a 1924 article in The Richmond Banner, it was believed the cemeteries could lead to plague and pestilence if they were not removed.Thousands of bodies were disinterred and taken to nearby Colma for reburial. A photograph of the digging at Odd Fellows Cemetery appears to show a methodical process, but somehow at least one small coffin was missed.Somebody loved this child tremendously, said Elissa Davey, founder of Garden of Innocence, a nonprofit organization that buries abandoned children. Ms. Davey arranged for donations of the coffin and the burial plot at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Colma.The childs family must have been pretty wealthy, Ms. Davey said. Instead of a $2 wooden box, the little girl was buried in a windowed cast-iron coffin that cost $50 to $100, she said. The coffin, Ms. Davey added, was manufactured in 1858.If a childs identity is unknown, Ms. Davey insists that a name is given before burial. As a genealogist conducting her own research, Ms. Davey has examined old maps from the Odd Fellows Cemetery and collected the names of more than 100 girls who were buried there shortly before 1890, the year the city passed an ordinance outlawing burial at the cemetery.Mortality among young children was common then. In 1900, children under age 5 accounted for nearly a third of all deaths in the United States. A century later, that number was reduced to around 1 percent. There were even more names of children who were buried at the cemetery, but Ms. Davey said she had given up.Ms. Davey has fielded calls about the little girl from as far away as London, Rome and Australia. A lot of people are calling us who say they know who it is, she said. A psychic once told her that her hair was standing on her arm. She knows what the childs name is. Ms. Davey discounted that claim and is not hopeful of finding the girls identity, saying those chances are slim to none.Thomas Carey, a librarian and archivist with the San Francisco Public Librarys History Center, may be closer to solving the mystery.Mr. Carey compared homestead maps of the Odd Fellows Cemetery with more detailed cemetery plot maps from the California Genealogical Society, closing to within 100 feet of where the coffin was found. Researching other documents, Mr. Carey looked for names of young people buried in that section of the cemetery. He has identified four girls age 5 and under. Using city directories and digital versions of San Francisco newspapers, he plans to search death notices.It was the naming of the child that motivated Mr. Carey, whose father died recently. He had a name and we knew who he was. I had a bit of an issue of renaming the girl, he said. She once was someone, he said. Somebody ought to figure that out.This girl cries out to me, said Janet McDonald, one of the mourners at the burial service. Ms. McDonald wants to know: What took her life and how could they forget her?"}
{"text": "A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility on Friday for a car bombing this week that killed 11 people and wounded dozens near a central tourist district in Istanbul.The group  Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or T.A.K.  said the attack on Tuesday had been carried out in retaliation for Turkish Army operations in the Kurdish-dominated region of southeastern Turkey, and it warned tourists to stay away from the country.The action was carried out to counter all the savage attacks of the Turkish Republic in Nusaybin, Sirnak and other places, T.A.K. said in a statement, referring to areas in the southeast where the army has been fighting Kurdish militants. We again warn foreign tourists who are in Turkey and who want to come to Turkey: Foreigners are not our target, but Turkey is no longer a reliable country for them.T.A.K., which claimed responsibility in February for an attack on a military convoy in Ankara, the capital, that killed 28 people, is considered an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K.The P.K.K. has fought the Turkish state for decades, a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Violence has surged since last summer, when a fragile truce fell apart.The attack on Tuesday involved explosives in a car that were detonated by remote control as a police bus drove past in the Beyazit neighborhood during the morning rush. Seven police officers were among the 11 killed.The neighborhood, and the nearby Grand Bazaar and Istanbul University, are part of the Fatih district, on the European side of Istanbul."}
{"text": "Among the dignitaries who will speak on Friday at Muhammad Alis memorial service in Louisville, Ky., such as former President Bill Clinton and the comedian Billy Crystal, is one Washington figure who might be something of a surprise: Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.Mr. Ali, the former heavyweight champion, showed up in Mr. Hatchs office in the Senate one day in 1988, apparently impressed by Mr. Hatchs performance at some high-profile hearings. A deep friendship was born.Mr. Ali campaigned in Utah for Mr. Hatchs re-election in 1988 and attended the Republican National Convention that year at his invitation. The former champion was a participant in golf fund-raising events for a charity organized by Mr. Hatch, and the pair were in frequent contact over the years; Mr. Hatch once had one of the fighters championship rings, but he returned it on the advice of the ethics committee.I like Orrin, Mr. Ali told Insight Magazine in 1988. Hes a nice fella. Hes a capable man and hes an honest man. And he fights for what he believes in.Mr. Hatch, a former Mormon bishop, will be representing the Mormon Church at the interfaith service.Muhammad Ali was the toughest of the tough, yet he was also gentle and kind, Mr. Hatch said upon Mr. Alis death. He could spar with the best of them in the ring, but outside the spotlight, he was meek and mild.Mr. Clinton had long called Mr. Ali a friend, a bond first forged when Mr. Clinton was president. After he left the White House, the relationship developed over meals, at awards ceremonies and during other special events.At a White House party in 2000, Mr. Clinton wrapped the retired champion in a bear hug. In 2005, the former president traveled to Louisville for the dedication of the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum and multicultural venue; three years later, Mr. Ali attended the opening session of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York.Campaigning for his wife in California last week, Mr. Clinton recalled Mr. Alis exuberance in the ring (Is this guy a boxer or a ballerina? Mr. Clinton remembered thinking as a boy) and the quiet dignity of his later years, most memorably as the final torchbearer at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.Once the most graceful, powerful athlete in the world, with his hands shaking, holding on, Mr. Clinton said. He did his job.In excerpts from his planned eulogy, Mr. Hatch said that, although his friendship with Mr. Ali may have been puzzling to some, where others saw difference, Ali and I saw kinship.He added: We were both dedicated to our families and deeply devoted to our faiths, and were both products of humble backgrounds and hardscrabble youth. But, he continued, our differences fortified our friendship; they did not define it."}
{"text": "For months, a central question of the 2016 presidential race has been how much distance Hillary Clinton needs to keep between herself and President Obama.In the last 50 years, voters have shown little interest in backing the candidate of the same party as a sitting president. (The exception is George Bush, who succeeded Ronald Reagan.)But the country has grown drastically more partisan in recent years. Mrs. Clinton is relying on support from the Obama coalition to be elected. And Mr. Obama is relying on her to continue his legacy.And so the two will make their first joint campaign appearance next week, in Wisconsin, one of a series of events they are expected to hold together.Over the course of a toxic presidential race, both Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump have accrued historically high negative ratings in polls. Mr. Obamas numbers, perhaps as a result of the vitriolic presidential race, have improved. And he hopes that his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, announced after he held a meeting on Thursday with her rival, Bernie Sanders, will bring the Vermont senators supporters to her side.Still, Mrs. Clinton needs to maintain a separate political identity from Mr. Obamas. And so, while the accelerated endorsement from Mr. Obama was welcomed by Democrats who have been urging the party to unite, the general-election campaign needs to remain Mrs. Clintons show."}
{"text": "BANGALORE, India  A court in western India on Saturday ordered a member of a right-wing Hindu sect held in connection with the 2013 murder of Narendra Dabholkar, a physician who spent his adult life crusading against spiritual practices he considered fraudulent.The killing of Dr. Dabholkar, who was shot at point-blank range while walking near his home in Pune, took place at a time of rising ideological change in India, when more conservative strains of Hinduism have been gaining resonance nationally.The suspect, Virendra Tawde, also a doctor, appeared in a Pune courtroom on Saturday and was ordered held until Thursday. Dr. Tawde had known Dr. Dabholkar for years and had clashed with him over his campaigns against superstitious practices, according to the victims son.Dr. Tawde is associated with a division of Sanatan Sanstha, an organization based in Goa that immerses its followers in a regimen of meditation and chanting, offering what it calls an escape from addiction and materialism. The groups founder, a former hypnotherapist known as His Holiness Dr. Jayant Athavale, has called the shooting a blessing from God because Dr. Dabholkar had escaped dying from old age.At the time of his murder, Dr. Dabholkar had been lobbying intensively for the passage of legislation banning a list of mystical practices, including animal sacrifice, the magical treatment of snakebites and the sale of magic stones.He had many enemies, having spent decades trying to weaken the pervasive cultural influence of gurus, godmen and religious activists in India. Among his endeavors was a roadshow in which activists performed what some people called feats of magic, such as lying on a bed of nails, in order to debunk them. They told crowds, Just remember, miracles can never happen.Hamid Dabholkar, Dr. Dabholkars son, said that several years ago Dr. Tawde and his father had lived in the same city, where Dr. Tawde led violent protests against his father over the issue of ritual immersions of Hindu idols in rivers and lakes. Dr. Dabholkar opposed that practice, saying it polluted natural water sources.Later, Mr. Dabholkar said, Dr. Tawde confronted his father over the legislation against black magic. It indicates that it was cooking for a long time, planned and executed in cold blood, Mr. Dabholkar said.The police turned their attention to Sanatan Sanstha immediately after Dr. Dabholkars killing, searching its ashram and compiling a list of nearly 100 members to be interrogated. After that, however, the investigation seemed to founder.Mr. Dabholkar said he believed the political authorities and law enforcement officials had been reluctant to single out Sanatan Sanstha because of its religious nature. He said progress seemed to be made only recently, after the states high court was directed to monitor the investigation and began to apply pressure.There have been calls to ban Sanatan Sanstha since 2008, when people linked to the group were convicted of bombing theaters. Spokesmen for the organization, however, say it is opposed to the use of violence.Inside its Goa compound, members live a spartan, celibate life, cataloging their sins each day in handwritten notes that they post on a bulletin board.The organization distributes books and newspapers promoting a movement to establish a Hindu nation, a step it says is needed to challenge the onslaught of Western culture. It encourages members to file police complaints against people who criticize Hindu Dharma and to take actual physical action to promote Hindu practices and beliefs.Durgesh Samant, one of the organizations trustees, said Sanatan Sanstha held certain beliefs in common with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist group that is the ideological branch of Prime Minister Narendra Modis governing Bharatiya Janata Party.The main difference, he said, is that Sanatan Sanstha emphasizes spiritual practices. You might say we are like-minded on social issues, he said."}
{"text": "Norman Mailer, the pugilistic literary lion, opened The Fight, his account of Muhammad Alis victory in Zaire over George Foreman in 1974, with a ripe evocation of Alis magnetism, a sort of carnal electricity, which made him such a compelling subject.There is always a shock in seeing him again, he wrote. Not live as in television, but standing before you, looking his best. Then the Worlds Greatest Athlete is in danger of being our most beautiful man, and the vocabulary of Camp is doomed to appear. Women draw an audible breath. Men look down. They are reminded of their lack of worth. If Ali never opened his mouth to quiver the jellies of public opinion, he would inspire love and hate. For he is the Prince of Heaven  so says the silence around his body when he is luminous.Ali captivated writers for more than 50 years, and his death this month at 74 is unlikely to diminish his power as a literary muse.David Hirshey, the senior vice president and executive editor of HarperCollins, called Ali the perfect prism through which to view sports, race, religion, politics, celebrity, comedy, tragedy. Hirshey, who published Mark Krams revisionist look at Ali, Ghosts of Manila, in 2001, added: And at the same time, hes also an extraordinary kaleidoscope  depending on who is looking at him, and how you always get a different image. I suspect there will be endless angles for generations to come.Ali has had his life story told repeatedly. He has been written about as a mystic, a healer, a friend to ordinary folks, a rapper and an acolyte of Malcolm X. He put his name to a 1975 autobiography and cooperated with Thomas Hauser on a 1991 biography that was written as an oral history (Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times). He was the co-author of The Soul of a Butterfly with one of his daughters, Hana, and the outsize star of a 75-pound tome(GOAT: A Tribute to Muhammad Ali) that was covered in silk and leather and cost up to $7,000.New entries are already being added. Sports Illustrated is publishing a commemorative book this month composed largely of Ali articles from its archive. The magazine, as well as Time and Life, put out a special edition that went on sale Friday.Another Ali book by Hauser, Muhammad Ali: A Tribute to the Greatest  a reissue of a 2005 collection of his writings about Ali with some newer pieces added  was just published. And a book by Josh Gross about Alis not-so-great adventure in Japan with the wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 (Ali vs. Inoki)  and its influence on mixed martial arts  will be available this month from BenBella Books.A biography from Jonathan Eig, who has written books about Lou Gehrig, Al Capone and Jackie Robinson, is scheduled to be published in 2017. Eig looked at the array of Ali books about three years ago and determined that the oeuvre lacked a complete biography, the closest being Hausers oral history.Theres a ton of new material and new information that no one has come across before, Eig said. I found some of it in the archives of people who interviewed him over the years, who left their note and tapes, some in court records, and some in interviews. His wives had never really discussed what their lives were like with him.And in a vow that sounded almost Ali-like, he added: I think Ill blow peoples minds with some of the stuff Ive discovered about Ali, in good ways and bad ways. I think people will be shocked by the book.While Eig chose to re-examine the full breadth of Alis life and career, Randy Roberts and Johnny Smith took a rigorous look at a critical slice of Alis earlier years: how Cassius Clay become Muhammad Ali, which they delve into in their recently published book, Blood Brothers: The Fatal Friendship Between Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X (Basic Books).We werent the first to recognize this, but most of their relationship was clandestine, so the only way to get to it was to systematically go through newspapers and F.B.I. reports to create a day-by-day itinerary of each man, Roberts, a history professor at Purdue, said of Ali and Malcolm X. We got into the politics of the Nation of Islam, the schism between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, what role Cassius Clay played in that schism and how he was used as a pawn by both characters.Once Muhammad had cast Malcolm X out of the Nation of Islam, Clay, who had only recently taken his new name, turned his back on Malcolm X.When Malcolm lost the contest for Clays loyalty, Roberts and Smith write, he had no more moves, no more pawns to sacrifice. At that moment Malcolm was expendable. At that moment, his life was in jeopardy. He was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965.Hauser, a longtime boxing writer who spent considerable time with Ali in the 1980s and 90s, reflected with sadness that the world was able to watch Ali deteriorate over the years, in contrast with world figures like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, whose physical declines were largely shielded from the public. Ali was not ashamed of the effects of Parkinsons disease and often wanted to travel and be seen.We watched this man wither in the public eye, Hauser said by telephone. Lennox Lewis told me he retired when he did as heavyweight champion because of what happened to Ali. Everyone knew the end was coming and quite a few people, myself included, felt it was merciful. And, he said, younger generations who experienced Ali in decline missed the sight of him healthy, flicking his jab, declaring his greatness, admiring his prettiness and standing, in braggadocio, in victory over a supine Sonny Liston.It will take time, he wrote, for the image of the aging Ali to fade and for the image of the young Ali to be restored."}
{"text": "OSLO  As maritime fender-benders go, this one couldnt help attracting attention: Noahs ark crashed into a Norwegian Coast Guard patrol boat in the Port of Oslo on Friday morning.It was not, of course, the actual ark, but one of two reconstructions that a Dutch carpenter named Johan Huibers painstakingly built over seven years, based on the biblical description. More than a million people have visited the replicas to see domesticated animals like llamas, ponies and rabbits, and to hear, as Mr. Huibers intended, a message of Gods love.The smaller of the arks was being towed on Friday when the crew lost control, which led to the collision. No animals were on board and no one was injured, but the arks wooden cladding was damaged. A small crane on the patrol boat was also damaged, Lt. Rune Svartsund, a coast guard spokesman, said.Ole Herman Kjernsby, the head of travel at Stena Line, a ferry company based in Oslo, said his staff members did not witness the accident but could see the damage to the ark afterward, including what he called a huge rift in the side.We were all surprised, Mr. Kjernsby said in a telephone interview. Accidents happen so rarely here, especially with such large vessels.Jokes soon began flying on social media. It is unclear what happened to the 8.7 million x 2 animals on board, Tom Egeland, a crime novelist who lives in Oslo, wrote on Twitter, using one estimate of the number of species on the planet.The 900-year-old captain has been detained, Jon Are Rakvag, a software security architect for the Norwegian Police Service, wrote in a Twitter post, alluding a bit imprecisely to the account in Genesis that Noah lived 350 years after the flood and died at 950.But the accident was no laughing matter for Mr. Huibers or for Aad Peters, a Dutch puppeteer, television producer and philanthropist who bought the smaller ark in 2010. Mr. Peters has taken it for visits to towns across the Netherlands, and was preparing to do the same in Norway when the collision occurred.Im shaking now, Mr. Huibers, 58, said by telephone from Amsterdam. Its a terrible situation. Its an awful dream, to have an accident with the ark of Noah.He said he had spoken to Mr. Peters, who was too distraught to comment publicly. I have to help him out, Mr. Huibers said. I have to go to Norway with wood, nails and a hammer to repair it.The smaller ark was the first one he built, between 2005 and 2007, Mr. Huibers said, which helped prepare him to tackle the second one at a more biblical scale  about 410 feet long, 95 feet wide and 75 feet tall. The bigger one has five decks and can accommodate 5,000 people at a time; it moved to Rotterdam earlier this year from its previous mooring in the Dutch port of Dordrecht. Both arks are built on steel barges, and neither has an engine; they must be towed wherever they go.An American charity, the Ark of Noah Foundation, based in Pasadena, Calif., was established to take charge of the larger ark, which it hopes to take to Rio de Janeiro in time for the Paralympic Games in September.It brings hope and joy, said Herald A.M.A. Janssen, the foundations director and a friend of Mr. Huibers. Its not only meant to bring the Gospel. We will also bring hope to the favelas, to people living in poverty, people from the streets, parents, drug addicts, prostitutes."}
{"text": "This article originally appeared in The New York Times on March 9, 1971.In a classic 15-round battle, Joe Frazier broke the wings of the butterfly and smashed the stinger of the bee last night in winning a unanimous 15-round decision over Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden.Defying an anonymous lose or else death threat, Frazier settled the controversy over the world heavyweight championship by handing Ali his first defeat with a savage attack that culminated in a thudding knockdown of the deposed titleholder from a hammerlike left hook in the final round.During the classic brawl, one man in the sellout throng of 20,455 died of a heart attack.When the verdict was announced, Ali, also known as Cassius Clay, accepted it stoically.Hurried to his dressing room rather than the postfight interview area, Ali remained there for about half an hour. Suddenly, he departed for Flower-Fifth Avenue Hospital for X-rays of the severely swollen jaw. He was released from the hospital after 40 minutes and left unbandaged.But even before Alis jaw began to bloat, the unbeaten Frazier had dulled the vaunted weapons of his revival in recording his 27th victory, although he failed in his quest for his 24th knockout. Alis defeat ended his winning streak after 31 triumphs, with 25 knockouts.I always knew who the champion was, Frazier, his brow swollen above each eye, said with a smile.The officials agreed with the Philadelphia slugger. Judge Bill Recht awarded him 11 rounds to four for Ali, while the other judge, Artie Aidala, had Frazier ahead by 9-6. Referee Arthur Mercante had it the closest, 8-6 for Frazier with one round even. During his uncharacteristic postfight silence, Ali sent this word to newsmen through Drew (Bundini) Brown, his assistant trainer: Dont worry, well be back, we aint through yet. But regarding a possible return bout, Frazier said, I dont think Clay will want one.Ali had predicted Frazier would fall in six rounds and he had maintained that there was no way the recognized champion could outpoint him. But the swarming Philadelphia brawler, battering his Cherry Hill, N.J., neighbor, ended the 29-year-old Alis credibility as a prophet.At the age of 27, Frazier justified his reign for all the world to see on a television network with an audience estimated at 300 million. Each fighter will receive $2.5 million from a possible $25 million in total worldwide receipts. The $1,352,951 gate at the Garden was a record for an indoor bout.Ali remained unscratched, except for a slightly bloodied nose, but his jaw began to swell on both sides in the late rounds from Fraziers persistent hammering.In the final round, Frazier landed a wild left hook that sent Ali sprawling onto his back in a corner. But the 6-to-5 betting underdog was up almost instantly and took the mandatory eight-count on unsteady feet. Moments later, Frazier jolted his 215-pound rival with another left hook.With a minute remaining, Ali desperately tried for a knockout, but his punches had virtually no effect. With the crowd roaring in the final seconds, the bell rang and Frazier playfully cuffed Ali across his head, bowed in apparent defeat.Alis strategy obviously had been to let Frazier grow arm-weary while pummeling him. But the chunky champion, despite a 6 -inch disadvantage in reach, defied Alis tiring jab and moved in under to convince the Garden audience he deserved the decision.When the decision was announced, a patter of boos erupted, but the cheers soon thundered above them.Except for the first round, when the red tassels on Alis high white shoes flopped in rhythm to his ballerina moves, the deposed titleholder primarily used a flat-footed stance, a radical departure from his floating, stinging style prior to his 3  -year exile that ended last year.While his exile matured Alis physique, it sabotaged his speed. But in red velvet trunks, he was as arrogant as ever even before the midring instructions. Twice he shouldered Frazier, in green-and-gold brocade trunks, as he whirled around the ring. And twice Frazier glared in contempt.During the early rounds, Frazier pounded his left hook into Alis midsection, but several times the deposed champion shook his head in the clinch as if to reassure his idolators.At the end of the second round, Ali waved his right glove in derision at Frazier as they walked to their corners. And during that intermission, he showed his disdain by refusing to rest on his stool and moving threateningly to the center of the ring before the bell rang for the third.Moments later, Alis voice could be heard through the microphone hanging over the ring. Mercante warned Ali that no talking would be tolerated.Soon, Ali wasnt talking anymore. Near the end of the fourth, Fraziers left hook bloodied Alis nose. And in the fifth, Frazier strayed from his taciturn character.Frazier was literally laughing in Alis face now and he was in command. When the bell ended the fifth round, Frazier cuffed Ali across the top of the head.In the tremendous tempo, Frazier was fulfilling his strategy to kill the body and the head will die. But somehow, Alis head remained alive through the middle rounds as his sixth-round prediction was unfulfilled. But before the eighth round, a chant of Ali, Ali, Ali began.Momentarily inspired, Ali waved to the crowd and pointed to them as if to show Frazier it was his audience. But after the round, a roar of Joe, Joe, Joe disputed Alis confidence.More willing to trade punches, Ali slowed Fraziers pace. The champions legs were weaving instead of churning. Sensing a knockout opportunity, Ali pounced but Frazier, in his typical fury, fought him off. In the 10th, Ali glanced at the ringside and shouted, Hes out, in a reference to Fraziers weariness.In the 11th, Ali slipped to the canvas momentarily. Near the end of the round, he was made wobbly by a left hook. Fraziers savage flurry sent him stumbling into the ropes. He flopped around the ring on rubber legs, but appeared to be playing possum, perhaps to frustrate Frazier further.But in the 12th, Frazier, strengthened by the surging of joy he receives from punishing an opponent, resumed his frantic pace  but soon it slowed. Each boxer was moving securely, but slowly, until Frazier uncoiled the left hook that dropped Ali in the final round.It was only the third time Ali had been knocked down in his decade of competition. Sonny Banks floored him in 1962 during his 11th bout and Henry Cooper flattened him in 1963 during his 19th bout.But the knockdown by Frazier was the final embarrassment for the deposed champion, the sixth ex-heavyweight champion to fail in an attempt to regain his title. The others were Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey, Jim Jeffries, Bob Fitzsimmons and James J. Corbett. Only Floyd Patterson has succeeded in regaining it.In his failure, Ali not only lost, but more embarrassing, he was silenced."}
{"text": "This article originally appeared in The New York Times on July 21, 1996.ATLANTA Muhammad Ali floats above the Summer Games, no longer an elusive butterfly but a great glowing icon as large as a spaceship. He casts his light on every athlete, every spectator, every volunteer, all the people who walk these humid streets with just a little more zip in their step, now that they have seen Ali.The whole world gasped in shock early yesterday when Ali suddenly materialized on that platform at the far end of Olympic Stadium, the perfect choice to light the caldron.Who would have thought of Ali? Who would have predicted he could stand in front of the world, his body slowed by Parkinsons syndrome, and hold a flaming torch and transfer searing fire to a contraption that would raise the fire to the caldron?Putting the old rascal-prophet on the official pedestal raised the tempo of these 17 days. Let the Games begin, indeed. Yesterday we had glorious events scattered all over this city. Energized by the vision of Ali  hey, if Ali can hold that flame without toasting himself to a crisp, I can get up on three hours sleep  I went to the first gold medal event, in shooting, and saw an amazing reversal, a Polish woman beating a German woman on the last shot.My choice meant I missed the Hungarians beating the Russians in water polo, shades of 1956. A Belgian swimmer set a world record  and in a trial, no less. A hapless judo athlete from the other Georgia went to the wrong site and missed the official weigh-in and was disqualified. He should have blamed the horrendous transportation problems choking this Olympic city.The people from the Atlanta organizing committee can be flagellated for the clogged traffic and the rampant greed and tackiness of these Games, but Billy Payne and his colleagues must be praised for their innate understanding that Muhammad Ali, the former Cassius Clay, was the perfect symbol for the ceremony.Everybody knew the theme of these Games was look how far weve come, to justify this event being given to striving Atlanta. The ceremonys creators paid careful, artistic attention to the safe black poets and singers and athletes and martyrs of the South.Reviving the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther Kings I Have a Dream speech was as predictable as it was proper. His image makes International Olympic Committee members feel good about choosing Atlanta. Who is to say that an elderly Dr. King would not have been outside the stadium with a bullhorn, goading the smug fat cats of Atlanta about housing and jobs?Ali was the shocker, the wild card. When people speculated who would be the final holder of the flame, few mentioned Ali because they knew he was not healthy.Nobody wanted Ali to be remembered as the weakened legend who dropped the Olympic torch in front of billions of people around the world. Ali was 100 feet tall, even without his image on the message board. We could all see him with our naked eye, his mystical half smile lighting up the steamy night. Hang on to the torch, Ali. Thats what we said in my section.But Ali has always been full of surprises. He could float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, could charm the world as a beautiful youth when he won the gold at the Summer Games of 1960, he could spout doggerel and he could beat bad Sonny Liston, could be cruel to opponents, could defy the draft board, could come back and regain his heavyweight championship.Somewhere along the line, even to most of white America, Ali stopped being a frightening symbol of a foreign religion and a menacing black man and a threat to the welfare of his homeland, and he became a fragile legend, damaged by the punches of his brutal sport, unable to rouse the wit and flash of his youth.Putting him on that platform was a stroke of genius that transformed a very nice ceremony into a celebration, a block party. I was sitting with a black male colleague and a white female colleague, and when we saw Ali shining on that platform, we exchanged high-fives at the audacious perfection of it. Ali was at the Games. Ali was on the hill. Raise the flame. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, all of us."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  I really felt like the roof had caved in on me, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said the other day, recalling the low point of his five years as the Obama administrations top appellate lawyer.Mr. Verrilli, 58, is preparing to step down from the job this month after a tenure that included 37 Supreme Court arguments and a string of major victories on behalf of a Democratic president facing a court dominated by conservative justices. But the scathing reviews of his most important Supreme Court argument, in the 2012 case challenging the constitutionality of President Obamas health care law, still sting.Minutes after the presentation was over, Jeffrey Toobin, the CNN legal analyst, said it had been a train wreck for the Obama administration, adding that this law looks like its going to be struck down.Mr. Verrilli said reviews like that were quite rough.I wont kid you, he said. It was hard, really hard. Not only because I like to think of myself as a good lawyer, but also this was an incredibly consequential case. It mattered to the president. It mattered to the administration. It mattered to the country.The Supreme Court upheld the law, and on grounds that Mr. Verrilli had been instrumental in pressing. Still, he said, the argument began poorly. For starters, he had participated in so many practice sessions that his voice was shot.It just seized up on me, he said, the memory fresh. And then I took a sip of water and it went down the wrong way and I couldnt get any words out. It affected my concentration. I definitely lost my concentration at the beginning of the argument.I got off to a really bad start, he added. But I thought that over the course of the hour, that Id basically clawed my way back into the conversation. And then in the last third of the argument, I felt like I was making the points I wanted to make in the way I wanted to make them.The points must have landed, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. accepted Mr. Verrillis position that a central requirement of the law was authorized by the congressional power to levy taxes, handing him a stunning 5-to-4 victory.Mr. Verrilli said he and his colleagues had made a conscious decision to push the tax argument to the extent we did.That had always been part of the case, but once it got to the Supreme Court, we put a lot of work into making that a stronger argument, he said. So I thought the lawyering may have made a difference there.Mr. Toobin, for his part, said last week that he had been half-right. I dont think I was wrong about the quality of the argument, he said. I was wrong about its importance to the resolution of the case.Mr. Toobin added: I think what I am guilty of is ascribing too much importance to oral argument, period. The justices all say the briefs matter a great deal more than oral arguments. Thats a lesson I keep learning.Mr. Verrilli, sitting in his favorite armchair in his hushed office at the Justice Department, said there were no hard feelings.Jeff Toobin, I give the guy a lot of credit, Mr. Verrilli said. He came in and he apologized.Mr. Verrilli said he learned an important lesson from the criticism he had endured. Its not a good or healthy thing to have your sense of self-worth determined by what other people are saying, he said.I wish Id learned that before I was in my mid-50s but, you know, it helped a lot to learn it.Last year, Mr. Verrilli prevailed in a second health care case, a challenge to nationwide tax subsidies. And he helped persuade the court to recognize a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.Mr. Toobin said Mr. Verrilli was at his best in the marriage case. That was the perfect combination of legal expertise and moral righteousness, he said. I dont know that I ever heard a better argument in the court.The loss he most regrets, Mr. Verrilli said, was in 2013, in Shelby County v. Holder, which effectively struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.There are some powerful real-world consequences that followed very quickly from that decision, he said. It was an iconic statute and an important part of American history. That was a tough loss.Mr. Verrilli said he has made no plans beyond taking a long break that will include a trip to Italy. He said he would leave a gift for his deputy, Ian H. Gershengorn, who will now lead the office.Ive become a devotee of throat lozenges, Mr. Verrilli said. Ill always have one in my mouth right before I start an argument. Ive got a bag of throat lozenges Im going to leave for him.In April, before the last argument of the term, Mr. Verrilli rose to make a final request. He made a motion to admit his wife, Gail W. Laster, to the bar of the Supreme Court.Mr. Verrilli recited the usual words, saying that he was satisfied that his wife possesses the necessary qualifications.In response, Chief Justice Roberts departed from the script. You better be, he said warmly and to laughter.Mr. Verrilli said the moment would stay with him. The chiefs joke was really terrific, he said. That was really sweet of him, actually.Mr. Verrilli will be gone by the last week of the Supreme Court term, when the biggest decisions usually land. In the past, he has been in his usual seat in the courtroom when justices announce their opinions.This year, he said, the news will reach him soon enough.Ill find out pretty fast, and hopefully Ill have a glass of Chianti in my hand, Mr. Verrilli said. Im good with it. Ive had enough moments of high drama sitting in that seat."}
{"text": "It is among the success stories of industrial New York: A warehouse that once housed a copper company was transformed into a film studio replete with stages, sound rooms and sets as the city experienced a boom in film and television production.Eastern Effects, the company that built the studio, started in 1999 with a single employee in an apartment-size office and grew to include a small complex of buildings in the gentrifying area around the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. Large segments of The Americans, the show on FX about Cold War spies, were shot there.But this week, the company learned that it would most likely have to leave the warehouse, home to most of its production space, within five years. The parcel, at 270 Nevins Street, was selected by the city and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency to be used in its cleanup of the area, part of an agreement that was made final on Thursday.In its cleanup of the canal, declared a Superfund site in 2010, the E.P.A. worked with the city to find a location for an eight-million-gallon sewage tank to help curb discharge during heavy rains.While the agency had pushed to put the tank under Thomas Greene Playground, the city and park advocates balked, warning that it would require closing parts of the playground and a pool for a decade. The tank is now planned for a parcel just north of the film studio, across the street from the park. The warehouse site is needed as a staging area to build the tank, officials say.Scott Levy, the founder and co-owner of Eastern Effects, said he was formally notified of the plan in April.Though the warehouse is one of four buildings his company uses in Gowanus, it is the largest. The possibility that the warehouse will be demolished, he said, will drastically affect his ability to attract large productions like The Americans.Im distraught, Mr. Levy said by phone on Friday. I spent my life building this business, creating this studio and being in New York City and Brooklyn. And I feel completely unsupported.Mr. Levy said the loss of the building was one hurdle among many his company has faced.He said he spent five years searching for the building and was still paying off loans related to a $5 million investment he made to renovate it after signing a 20-year lease in 2009. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck, flooding much of the area around the canal and requiring $100,000 worth of repairs to the building, he said.Now, because of the terms of his lease, he is not entitled to any compensation if the property ends up being seized under eminent domain, though he could potentially receive compensation if the buildings owner agrees to sell the property to the city.Its not an easy thing to find industrial space in Brooklyn, he said.More than 2,100 people, including the actress Edie Falco, wrote letters in support of Eastern Effects, a company spokesman said.Elias Rodriguez, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said it was the citys idea to use the warehouse property.Mr. Levy identified three other parcels near his business that he believed could be viable sites. Two of them, he said, have for sale signs in front.But Ted Timbers, a spokesman for the citys Department of Environmental Protection, defended the citys choice, though he said the department would continue to look for possible alternatives.He said the other sites mentioned by Mr. Levy had drawbacks. One is owned by Consolidated Edison, and two others consist of multiple properties, he said.Moreover, the warehouses location, immediately adjacent to the planned site of the tank, would have less impact on the area and the street, Mr. Timbers said. He said the other sites would have required the closing of Nevins Street for as long as eight years.The agreement with E.P.A. is good news for the residents of Gowanus, as it minimizes any disruption to one of the few playgrounds and swimming pools in the neighborhood, a statement from the department said.The city has until April 2020 to acquire the properties for the project, including the staging area. The warehouse would not need to be vacated until May 2021. According to the agency, the building would have to be demolished.Mr. Levy said he had trouble squaring the decision with the citys often-stated support for the booming film and television business.This is someones decision, he said. This is not a freak accident. They looked at a map and put a tack down and said, Its a good site."}
{"text": "MONTCLAIR, N.J.  If theater to you is sustenance, if you are the sort of person who savors the daring and the visionary, then head to New Jersey, where the Italian avant-garde director Romeo Castellucci and his company, Societas Raffaello Sanzio, are offering a thrilling repast at Montclair State University  but only through Sunday.The production, Go down, Moses, part of the invaluable Peak Performances series at the Alexander Kasser Theater, is intended as a contemporary transfiguration of the Moses story, but dont expect an updated version of Exodus. Mr. Castellucci, whose work has often been seen in Montclair but, mystifyingly, is never seen in New York City, is engaging with Moses mostly on an abstract level.Yet this largely wordless series of tableaus tells a story of abandonment, and the baby in the bulrushes isnt the only injured party.Mr. Castellucci places the action at a distance from us, behind a softening scrim that flattens the dimensions, making stage images into canvases that come alive. Noise is the most immediate sensation, like the whimpering of a woman (Rascia Darwish), blood-soaked and alone on the floor of a single-occupancy public bathroom. We hear her agonized weeping as she tries to stanch the hemorrhaging and stop the baby she doesnt want from coming out of her.The newborn will end up in a Dumpster, its cries audible above the sound of passing cars. The sadness of this is horrible.The woman, still bloody, now delirious, is coldly interrogated by a police inspector (Sergio Scarlatella) determined to find the infant. They speak Italian; we read the excellent supertitles on the scrim. (The text is by Mr. Castellucci and his sister, Claudia Castellucci.)The woman is the picture of misery and isolation, and seems quite out of her mind. Her baby, she says, is Moses. She predicts a long life and great things  biblical things  for this child. A beatific peace comes into her face; she looks, momentarily, like a martyr.But to articulate what happens in Go down, Moses is almost to miss the point. This is, above all, a visceral experience.I dont know why a smile spread across my face when I watched a giant piece of machinery that Mr. Castellucci invented  a long, low, rotating horizontal cylinder  spin faster and faster while a turbine-engine sound reached an excruciating volume and pitch. I cant explain what made it so exciting and terrible to look at as, one by one, wigs of long dark hair were slowly lowered from above to get caught in it. And what that has to do with Moses I couldnt tell you.Toward the end of the production, we watch a wordless tableau of pre-human ancestors, a family in a cave, a baby who is welcome news. There is a mother here, too, and she is somehow the origin of us, and of art. This is not sentimentalism on Mr. Castelluccis part, but it is strangely, deeply moving.You might not realize how entirely youve entered into his world until he jolts you by changing its frame again. And then once more."}
{"text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.  Hours before some of the biggest names in sports, politics and entertainment converged to honor Muhammad Ali at a memorial service on Friday, tens of thousands of people lined the streets of his hometown chanting Ali! and throwing flowers as a hearse carried his body to a cemetery to be laid to rest.There were no barriers to keep people off the street, and they swarmed forward, tossing flowers onto the hearse. A gently chaotic decorum prevailed: Riding with the windows down, people in the limousines accompanying the hearse  including members of the Ali family, the actor Will Smith and the mayor, Greg Fischer  slapped hands with the spectators as they passed.The procession, more celebratory than somber, past his pink boyhood home and the museum and conference center that bear his name, wove 19 miles through the city to Cave Hill Cemetery, where Ali, who died last week at age 74, was buried in a private service.Muhammad wants young people to know that adversity can make you stronger, his wife, Lonnie, said later at a memorial service packed with dignitaries, taking stock of his bouts in and out of the ring. It cannot rob you of the power to reach your dreams.She added, It is far more difficult to sacrifice oneself in the name of peace than to take up arms in the name of violence.At a time of controversy over police shootings of young black people, Lonnie Ali recalled that Muhammad Ali got into boxing at the age of 12, after his bicycle was stolen. A white police officer taking the report suggested he learn to fight if he wanted to confront the person who took it.America must never forget, when a cop and an inner city kid talk to each other, miracles can happen, she said.President Bill Clinton alluded to Alis long fight with Parkinsons disease, recalling the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta when Ali, with trembling arms from the ailment, lit the torch to open the games.Besides being a lot of fun to be around and being a universal soldier for our common humanity, I will always think of him as a truly free man of faith, and being a man of faith, he realized hed never be in full control of his life, Clinton said. Something like Parkinsons could come along. But being free, he realized that life was still open to choices. Its the choices that Muhammad Ali made that brought us all here today in honor and love.Before they spoke, a diverse group of religious leaders at a memorial service later offered prayers, remembrances of Ali and, at times, pointed political remarks.The Rev. Kevin Cosby of St. Stephen Church in Louisville took note of the racial pride Ali instilled in African Americans, particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s.He dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves, he said. He dared to affirm the beauty of blackness, he dared to affirm the power and the capacity of African-Americans. He dared to love Americas most unloved race.Drawing rousing cheers, Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine and a liberal activist, declared, in what appeared to be a reference to anti-Muslim rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail, We will not allow politicians to put down Muslims, to blame Muslims for a few people.Long before the remarks, and eulogies by other speakers, including President Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal, and Bryant Gumbel, the motorcade offered a chance for Ali to be cheered and honored in the city where he grew up and never seemed to forget.Some of Alis opponents joined in.On Broadway in downtown Louisville, people were startled to see Larry Holmes, who beat Ali in February 1980, being led along the sidewalk outside the Brown Hotel with a young man at his elbow.Mr. Holmes smiled and said little as he shook hands and handed out signed picture cards.Well-wishers lined up eight and 10 deep along both sides of Broadway stretching for blocks. Office workers streamed from their desks to stand vigil as the procession neared and passed.The motorcade, which included more than a dozen vehicles, headed into the largely African-American neighborhood where Ali spent his formative years.There, in the parking lot of the Liquor Zone, nearly everyone seemed to have a story about either meeting Ali, or being inspired by him.Robert Mitchem, known as Froot Loop because people mistakenly think he likes that cereal, set up a shirt stand with two friends early in the morning.Mitchem wanted to be ready for the once-in-a-lifetime chance to commemorate the citys most famous son, and make a few bucks at it.Fruit or Fruity, as Mitchem is also known, had an array of different colored T-shirts with Alis picture and his most famous catchphrases, like Float like a Butterfly, sting like a bee.I hope to sell all of them, and when I die, I hope someone is going to have my name on a shirt, too, he said with a chuckle.At $15, the shirts, which Mitchem makes with a silk screen and heat press in the basement of his home, were a relative bargain, and word in the neighborhood was out.First a handful and then a torrent of customers came to buy the shirts. Then they opened lawn chairs, bottles of water and other, stronger beverages and awaited the three-time heavyweight champion.He was a dignitary from the sports world who traveled the globe, but he never forgot where he came from, said Wayne Simon, 72, who remembers Ali visiting their alma mater, Central High School, after he won a gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome.Despite the searing sun and rising temperatures, the several hundred people assembled in and around the parking lot celebrated Ali anew. Donald Doc Burress, 63, remembers as a kid crowding around his familys black-and-white television to watch Ali knock out Sonny Liston.What he did for Louisville, he was our spokesman, Burress said, his daughter and two grandchildren sitting by his side. He was bigger than Churchill Downs, the famed horse racing track that hosts the Kentucky Derby.Thalisa Price, who wore a leather vest with her nickname, Ms. Lovely, stitched on the back, wanted to buy an Ali shirt before leaving for Memphis on Saturday with her motorcycle club, the Naptown Riders.Im going to wear this shirt to let people know were from Louisville, she said.Eventually, the police closed traffic on Broadway and helicopters circled above the big intersection. The crowds on every corner swelled further. One fan who held a pair a red boxing gloves yelled, Come on, Champ, take your time. We aint gonna see you no more.A few minutes later, the motorcade arrived and, as in downtown, Alis fans rushed into the street.The procession passed, heading toward the boxers childhood home on Grand Avenue. People started folding their lawn chairs and heading back to their own homes. Mitchem, though, still had work to do. Having sold more than 10 dozen shirts, he was going to rush home and print some more.That was awesome, he said. It sent chills through me because it was like pure love."}

{"text": "NOT long ago I wrote an essay on how to talk about environmental issues with conservatives. Talk persuasively, that is, not confrontationally. A conservative promptly replied that I was afflicted with fundamental ignorance, and possibly worse. The gist of it was that conservatives are already environmentalists, and the rest of us are just too stupid to recognize it. I put on my cheerfully positive face and suggested that he amplify his point by listing 10 pro-environment actions by conservatives in this century. (O.K., maybe that was my passive-aggressive face, given that George W. Bush was president for eight of those 16 years.) He replied with more name-calling.This is a shame, because conservatives used to be almost by definition conservationists, focused on preserving our shared heritage from destructive influences. You can, in fact, date the rise of the conservation movement as a political force in this country to a December 1887 dinner party of wealthy big game hunters, largely Republicans, hosted in a Madison Avenue house by Theodore Roosevelt (still a hero to many modern conservatives, despite certain progressive leanings). He and his guests that night formed the Boone and Crockett Club, dedicated to preservation and management of game.Putting to work their considerable social and political clout, as well as their money, they went on to save the bison from extinction, greatly expand the national park system, and help establish both the National Wildlife Refuge System and the United States Forest Service. The Lacey Act, still our most important law against wildlife crime, was largely their doing. Ducks Unlimited, a Boone and Crockett offshoot, became an early force for wetland conservation.This natural link between conservatives and conservation lasted through much of the 20th century. Conservatives may complain about oil companies being shut out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but most of the credit for protecting that habitat belongs to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who also signed the nations first air pollution control law. Richard M. Nixon, not otherwise a candidate for sainthood, changed the way the nation lives, breathes and does business, establishing the Environmental Protection Agency and enacting the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, among other major environmental initiatives. George H. W. Bush, finally, began to take conservation in a new market-based direction, pushing through a cap-and-trade system in 1990 that enabled industry to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which causes acid rain, far more quickly and cheaply than anyone imagined possible.So what does it take to bring conservatives back, after a quarter-century of their reflexively treating even the mention of environmental issues as a treasonous attack on business and the nation? Its possible they are already returning, with the House of Representatives last month approving a major environmental reform by an astonishingly bipartisan 403 to 12 margin, and the Senate almost certain to follow.Among that legislations sponsors are the unlikely Senate partners Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. It repairs and strengthens the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, and belatedly enhances the Environmental Protection Agencys power to test the safety of chemicals being developed and manufactured every year. Industry came to the table because a single federal regulatory standard seemed preferable to state-by-state regulation. The rest was old-fashioned give-and-take, with each side resisting the urge to fling bombs at the other, and both swallowing aspects of the law they didnt like for the common good. It was a product, that is, of what we used to call democracy.Its also arguably a model for further cooperation on environmental issues. But how to make progress on other vital environmental issues? It will help for environmentalists to acknowledge past contributions by conservatives and also the potential value of conservative approaches for the future.For instance, a program called catch shares, pushed by both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, has arguably done more for fish stocks and the fishing industry than decades of old-style command-and-control government regulation. There are about 15 active fisheries nationwide, and federal councils simply establish the sustainable annual catch and allot a share to each fishing boat.As with cap-and-trade for acid rain, each participant is then free to figure out the most efficient way forward  going out when the weather is good, or the price is high, rather than wasting fuel and long hours racing to out-fish competitors in an artificially shortened season. The catch share system has begun to rebuilt stocks and increase profits for fisheries from Alaskan halibut to Gulf of Mexico red snapper. A study early this year found that kind of share-based reform has the potential to restore 98 percent of fisheries worldwide and sustainably feed a much larger human population by 2050.But win-win situations are hard to come by. Real progress may require both sides to rethink sacred cows. For instance, Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University law professor with a libertarian take, argues that perverse incentives make the Endangered Species Act ineffective. Landowners often deny wildlife researchers access to their land and have at times even destroyed potential habitat, for fear of endangered species (and the attendant regulations) turning up there. Mr. Adler argues for a system of easements and subsidies to reward property owners, instead of punishing them, for protecting endangered species.On the other hand, if conservatives genuinely oppose big government, Mr. Adler adds, they should start by opposing costly government programs that are a leading cause of environmental damage  including fossil fuel subsidies, ethanol subsidies, agricultural subsidies and many of the ill-conceived dam and irrigation projects of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.Mr. Adler doesnt draw the line at turning federal lands over to private ownership, under the right circumstances  for instance, with groups like the Nature Conservancy among the potential private owners. I think that would be a betrayal of Teddy Roosevelts considerable bequest to the nation, with Cliven Bundy clones more likely to be among the owners. But Mr. Adler and I could certainly talk about market-based alternatives to the current federal mismanagement.With recent polls suggesting that climate change has begun to loom ominously for many Republicans as it does for the majority of Democrats, it may be time for big, bold, even alarmingly bipartisan thoughts. In the end, our need for clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, a climate that does not change too drastically and forests, oceans and wildlife that remain healthy and resilient has almost nothing to do with whether we are Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or liberals, and everything to do with being fellow residents of Planet Earth, with no place else to call home. So heres the idea: Why dont we all just take a walk and have a long conversation about how we can fix up the old neighborhood together?"}

Chief Whent said in a statement late Thursday that he had worked to make the city safer by forging better ties with its diverse communities, and that the vast majority of Oakland officers shared that commitment. He gave no reason for stepping down. Chief Whent made his own decision about leaving the job, Mayor Libby Schaaf said Friday. The long troubled department is investigating allegations that several officers had sex with an underage girl. Two officers have resigned and two others remain on paid leave. Prosecutors are reviewing the Police Departments initial investigation of the allegations, the mayor said. Ben H. Fairow, deputy police chief at the regional transit system, replaces Chief Whent. (REUTERS)A Navy admiral will be sentenced in August after pleading guilty to lying to federal authorities investigating a $34 million fraud scheme involving a Malaysian contractor. The officer, Rear Adm. Robert Gilbeau, 55, becomes the highest-ranking military official to be taken down in the widespread scandal and is believed to be the first active-duty naval flag officer to be charged in federal court. At a hearing in San Diego on Thursday, Admiral Gilbeau stood before the judge with a small, fluffy white service dog and told the court that he was guilty as charged. He declined to comment after the hearing. The prosecutor, Mark Pletcher, said details would emerge at his sentencing hearing Aug. 26 when evidence would show Admiral Gilbeaus pervasive attempt to mislead the investigation. The case involved the contractor Leonard Glenn Francis. His company, which has provided fuel, food and other services to Navy ships in Asia for two decades, overbilled the maritime branch by more than $34 million, according to court documents. He is awaiting sentencing. So far 14 people have been charged in the case  including 11 current or former Navy officials. Half of them have pleaded guilty. (AP)"}
{"text": "A researcher at the University of Pittsburgh contracted the Zika virus after accidentally sticking herself with a needle, becoming what appeared to be the first known case of an infection in a lab, officials said.The Allegheny County Health Department said  the infection was unusual because the woman had not contracted the virus after traveling to an affected area or through sexual transmission. The unidentified researcher stuck herself on May 23, developing symptoms, including a fever, about a week later, said Joe Miksch, a university spokesman.The presence of the virus was confirmed in a blood sample, Mr. Miksch said, and the researcher returned to work on June 6. She has to wear long sleeves and pants, and use insect repellent for three weeks, Mr. Miksch said, to minimize the chance that a mosquito would get the virus from her and spread it to others.Mr. Miksch declined to answer further questions about the researchers condition.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists four known ways the virus has been transmitted: through mosquito bites, from a mother to her fetus, through sexual contact and via blood transfusion. But it does not mention any confirmed cases related to research.We do not know of any others, Dr. Karen Hacker, the director of the Allegheny County Health Department, said in a telephone interview Friday.There is no vaccine or medicine to treat Zika. In rare cases, the virus has caused paralysis and sometimes fatal complications in adults. In addition to fever, common symptoms include rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, although there may be no symptoms at all.The virus has been linked to abnormally small heads and brain damage in newborns, a condition called microcephaly.The University of Pittsburghs Graduate School of Public Health announced in April that it had started a program with the Brazilian Ministry of Healths Fundao Oswaldo Cruz Foundation to study the Zika epidemic.The researchers infection was the fourth confirmed case in Allegheny County, in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania. The other three people had contracted the virus abroad, according to the Health Department, which sought to calm fears of additional infections in the region.Dr. Hacker said in a statement, We want to remind residents that, despite this rare incident, there is still no current risk of contracting Zika from mosquitoes in Allegheny County.A statement from Allegheny County urged residents to use insect repellent containing DEET and to remove standing water, where the insects can breed.Dr. Hacker also warned that those traveling to countries affected by Zika should be cautious: The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected species of mosquito that is common in warm climates. Pregnant women, in particular, should avoid traveling to those countries, she said.The researchers infection was reported by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday.This week, new World Health Organization guidelines acknowledged that, with no vaccine available and mosquito eradication efforts failing to stem the spread of the infection, delaying pregnancy may be the best prevention for women in affected areas.So far, the hundreds of Zika cases reported in the United States appear to have been people who contracted the virus in Central and South America and in the Caribbean, where mosquitoes carrying the virus are widespread. But experts say mosquito transmission in the United States is inevitable and almost certain to begin in Southern states during the summer.The federal government is preparing to release a proposal for responding to the first homegrown cases of the Zika virus, health officials said Friday."}
{"text": "LONG before I came to the United States, I was fascinated by the American electoral process. I grew up in Pakistan in the 1980s, during the brutally repressive military dictatorship of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, when fear crushed hope.Finding old copies of Time magazine in my school library, I learned about primaries and presidential debates  something almost unimaginable in Pakistan at the time. I had a favorite board game where the players mission was to become the American president. I watched snippets of news, of the Bush-Dukakis race in 1988 and the Clinton-Bush-Perot debates four years later, that we got on our only TV channel. I missed a lot of the nuances, but I developed a deep admiration for the idea that a campaign had to present a vision that people cared about. You had to talk about a better future, and there was a strong undercurrent of hope.I like to think that my 12-year-old son, the first member of our family to be born in the United States, has inherited some of his love of American politics from me. We are practicing Muslims, and about four years ago my son wrote to Michael Dukakis, the former governor and Democratic presidential nominee, asking if a Muslim boy could become president. Mr. Dukakis invited my son to his office at Northeastern University, and among my sons most prized possessions now are a picture of himself with Mr. Dukakis and his audio recording of their conversation about elections.Encouraged by Mr. Dukakis, my son ran for class representative in sixth grade two years ago and won  by a landslide, according to his own exit polls. Last year, he ran for student council at his Boston-area middle school. He advised other candidates and wore a suit to school on election days. His schoolmates elected him student council secretary. He is on the email list of politicians and presidential campaigns from both parties. He wants to run for federal office one day and dreams of becoming president. He wants the voting age to be lowered to 12 so he can vote in this cycle.Until last summer, there was an inherent dignity and grace associated with running for the highest office in the country. At least that is what we told our son and our 9-year-old daughter. We taught them that hatred had no place in our hearts, or on any campaign trail. We told them that hard work, fair policy and fundamental decency were what voters really cared about. But over the last few months of this campaign, as they heard Republican candidates, especially the presumptive Republican nominee, and their supporters attack immigrants, and Muslims in particular, it has gotten hard to convince our children that these values matter.My daughter asked, Why do the candidates hate all Muslims? We told her that most people do not judge people based on religion, but that is not what we heard from the campaign.My son, too, has endless questions, of a different sort: Where are the boundaries in political campaigns? Why is it wrong to defame a religious group if it will get you more votes? Doesnt the end  winning  justify the means? Lately, I worry that this election may be pushing him toward pragmatism over the idealism that America represents to me. I dont want a 12-year-old to give up one for the other so early in life.I would like my children to always believe that they can change the world for the better and to believe that they do not have to compromise their values or ideals because that is what sells. At the same time, we are teaching them to not raise issues of Islamophobia and the presidential election in school for fear they might be bullied. The contradiction is not lost on us.In early December, we were celebrating our daughters birthday at her favorite restaurant, near our home. A woman approached our table and told my wife that she was offended by her and by her head scarf. The kids got scared, and we were too surprised to speak. In our 20 years in this country, my wife and I have received only kindness and support from colleagues, neighbors and even strangers.After the woman left, we told the waitress what had happened, and she was apologetic and kind. She insisted that the birthday cake for my daughter was on the house. Then, as we were walking out, another customer came over, hugged our daughter and slipped $10 into her hand, as a birthday gift. It was reassuring for our children to see that what we had been telling them about America was true, in spite of what they see on television.I am still encouraging my sons ambition to become president. My dream for both my children is that they will grow up in a country that judges them only on the strength of their character, the grandness of their ideas, the decency of their values and, ultimately, their actions. I refuse to give this up. That is what America has taught me to do."}
{"text": "Every Friday, The New York Times pop critics weigh in on the weeks most notable new songs and videos  and anything else that strikes them as intriguing  in a new version of the Playlist column. You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here. Like this  format? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com.It is the condition of extreme celebrity to be filmed, constantly. There are videos that constitute your work, videos filmed by friends, videos surreptitiously filmed by others, videos youve filmed yourself. To not be documented is, somehow, to not exist.So its odd that the video for Company, the tepid Justin Bieber club ballad, feels so pasted-together and like an afterthought. A modern version of the classic hair-metal road/tour video, its an amalgam of clips of Justin Doing Things. Theres performing, of course  snippets of recent appearances on the Purpose tour, one of the most fascinating and tragic live arena shows in recent memory, though little of that pathos is conveyed in these clips  but also sleeping in a van, jumping on a van, skateboarding, riding on a yacht, walking with Floyd Mayweather Jr., modeling Calvin Klein undergarments and seemingly hurling an iPhone into the desert. Symbolism!Mostly, Mr. Bieber looks tired, no matter the milieu. Such is the breadth of his fame that hes free to mope anywhere in the world he so chooses. He looks the happiest when making small gestures of authority-tweaking. With that in mind, if you would like to learn more about Mr. Bieber, perhaps check out a different video, also released this week, of him in a street fight outside a hotel in Cleveland, in which he displays more raw emotion than in the whole Company clip. JON CARAMANICAA 1960s-soul backbeat, a laconic electric rhythm guitar, some pinging keyboard tones and backup voices going ooh ooh are all Esm Patterson needs in No River as she measures herself against the vast, impersonal powers of Nature  a theme she often returns to on her new album, We Were Wild. I cant run forever  Im no river, she sings, and later, I cant sit still forever  Im no mountain. Instead, she has consciousness: I know that Im alive, she insists. Im human. Her voice, slender but determined, insists that the tradeoff is worthwhile. JON PARELESA young singer and cellist from North Carolina now based in Brooklyn, Kelsey Lu makes slow and spacious music, confronting you with lingering tones and vocal melodies that ascend and dive. She recently made an EP called Church, to be released July 9, which was recorded in Holy Family Roman Catholic Church in Greenpoint. The first song from it, Dreams, begins with multiple, echoed cello lines, some of them moving in contrary motion, continuing until halfway through a seven-and-a-half-minute song, when a steady pulse begins, made by finger on cello string. Her voice enters; shes singing about the Holy Ghost. Fair enough. But then she starts to sing pop lyrics in the same measured, intense manner: I know youre no good but I cant get enough of you. On Thursday shell perform a solo concert at that same church; tickets are available here. BEN RATLIFFLike Juan Atkins with techno and Joo Gilberto with bossa nova, the southern California band the Descendents have architect status in their field. Thirty-four years ago, on the record Milo Goes to College, they figured out the sardonic blueprint for pop-punk, in short and tuneful songs with bass lines running wide patterns. Theyre only together on and off anymore, but theyve got a new record coming out in July, Hypercaffium Spazzinate, and its first single, Victim of Me, came out this week: excited, self-analytical, middle-aged realism compressed into 97 seconds. BEN RATLIFFAre we at the freestyle revival yet? That fleet music  a fixture of mid-to-late-1980s New York dance floors, and one of the countrys underappreciated Latin sounds  often feels relegated to reunion shows. But on Crybaby, the singer-songwriter-producer Abra has found a modern way in. Those jaunty synths! That clattering, crisp percussion! Sweet vocals about dark things that sigh and fade! Crybaby has it all, while retaining a touch of the cloudiness thats always been a part of her work, all the way back to when she was recording goth-folk Gucci Mane covers. J.C.Since the early 1960s, the Brazilian singer Elza Soares has used her gritty voice like a jazz trumpet tone to scuff up samba songs. After a circuitous career traveling from popular to cult status, she can use it in different contexts and with different connotations. A Mulher do Fim do Mundo (The Woman at the End of the World), produced by Guilherme Kastrup and featuring a slate of So Paolo musicians including Kiko Dinucci of the excellent band Met Met, is up-to-date in sound: strings, electronics, dissonant electric guitars, Afro-Brazilian grooves, a raw samba-rock band. And its universal and tragic in its lyrics: death, domestic abuse, drug addiction, racism, deep-blood family ties. The albums title track, written for her by Romulo Froes and streamable at the Soundcloud page of the Brazilian label Mais Um Discos, is about a woman who lasts righteously  a witness, a celebrant, a mode of resistance. It doesnt sound like an aging artist of stature airlifted in to avant-gardism: Ms. Soares is pushing as hard as anyone else. B.R."}
{"text": "Had the floors of the St. Pauls Episcopal Church on Staten Island not been made of slate, the 150-year-old house of worship might have burned to the ground on Sunday, when, the police said, a person threw a burning bottle filled with flammable liquid through an open window. The bottle flamed out on the stone floor.The First Central Baptist Church a few blocks away, also in the Stapleton neighborhood of the islands North Shore, was likewise spared destruction on Thursday. Before dawn, someone tossed a similarly crude grenade at a window, but it bounced off and landed on an awning, burning the structure and scorching an exterior wall, the police said. A passing ambulance saw the fire and called for help before the flames spread.The police are investigating both arson fires as hate crimes, and the same man is believed to be responsible for the two attacks, Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, said on Friday.There are key pieces of evidence that link the two that I am not going to get into forensic-wise, Chief Boyce said. But we believe they were four blocks away from each other. The pieces of evidence we picked up are almost identical.Fire marshals believed the accelerant in the bottles was gasoline, Chief Boyce said, and investigators were canvassing area gas stations and backyards  anywhere people use gasoline  for more evidence.The hooded suspect was seen in surveillance video crossing the street near the intersection of Van Duzer and Beach Streets, around the corner from the Baptist church after it had been set on fire.The police, who released the video on Thursday, said the man had not been identified and remained at large.No one was injured in either attack, and both churches suffered minor damage, the police said.In a statement on Friday, State Senator Diane J. Savino called the arsonist a coward and condemned the hateful and senseless attacks.Its disturbing to even think that there are people living in our communities with such malice in their hearts, Ms. Savino said. First Central Baptist Church and St. Paul are places where a number of my constituents have been members for most of their lives, so it truly upsets me to hear what has happened.Michael E. McMahon, the Staten Island district attorney, said his office was monitoring the police investigation."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  With their nomination contests finally locked up, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump sought to rev up their core supporters on Friday during dueling speeches in which each cast the other as unfit for the presidency.Mixing policy arguments with personal attacks, the presumptive nominees clashed from across the capital as they previewed the arguments they will take to the country over the next five months.For Mr. Trump, who suffered perhaps the most damaging week of his yearlong campaign, a forum for evangelical Christians proved to be an unlikely haven, while Mrs. Clinton was greeted with cheers and pink Hillary signs as she vowed to protect womens rights from Mr. Trump and the Republicans.Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe, legal abortions has no idea whats best for women, Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump at a Planned Parenthood Action Fund event here. After all this is a man who has called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals.Her first major address since securing enough delegates to clinch the nomination served Mrs. Clinton on two fronts as she looks to mend fissures within the Democratic Party while turning to the general election. It allowed Mrs. Clinton, the first woman to secure a major partys presidential nomination, to demonstrate that a bedrock progressive cause was a top priority, and it gave her a forum to press her advantage with female voters against Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, whose attacks on Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina and Heidi Cruz during the primary campaign were widely condemned, boasts that he would be better for women than Mrs. Clinton, but polls so far show that women disagree. A Gallup survey in April found that 70 percent of women in the country viewed him unfavorably.Mrs. Clinton, who had a private meeting earlier in the day with one of her partys most effective critics of Mr. Trump, Senator Elizabeth Warren, did not confine her own critique of him to womens issues. She assailed Mr. Trump for accusing a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, of being biased because of his Mexican heritage, and she scolded Mr. Trump for disparaging a disabled reporter. His promise to make America great, she said, would set the country back decades.Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues that we care about, Mrs. Clinton said. He does not see all Americans as Americans.While Mrs. Clinton went on the offensive, Mr. Trump was relatively restrained in front of a group of evangelical activists as he looked to regain his footing amid the bipartisan backlash he has faced over his comments about Judge Curiel, who is presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University.Before the Faith and Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority Conference in Washington, Mr. Trump promised to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life and to restore respect for people of faith.When several young protesters disrupted his remarks, Mr. Trump watched as they were marched out by security guards, his old refrain of get them out! replaced with a lament about the rudeness of such interruptions and an assertion that the demonstrators were professional agitators sent by Democrats.But he also used the opportunity to make his case against Mrs. Clinton, attacking her economic plans and willingness to admit Syrian refugees into the country and questioning her judgment when she was secretary of state. Sticking mostly to policy, he only briefly referred to her as crooked.Shell appoint radical judges who will legislate from the bench, overriding Congress, and Ill tell you, the will of the people will mean nothing  nothing, he said. She will undermine the wages of working people with uncontrolled immigration, creating poverty and income insecurity.At one point, Mr. Trump tried to turn the tables on Mrs. Clinton, who regularly argues that he lacks the temperament to be president. In a line that seemed to fall flat, he said that she was unfit to lead because of her refusal to employ the phrase radical Islam when talking about terrorism.Referring to Mrs. Clintons call for President Obama to honor his pledge to take in more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, Mr. Trump challenged her to instead replace her support for increased refugee admissions with a new jobs program for our inner cities.We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with whats going on with refugees where we dont know where they come from, but we have to take a rest, Mr. Trump said, avoiding any discussion of his provocative plan to ban foreign Muslims from entering the country. We have to take a timeout. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans and work with them so they can come out of this horrible situation that theyre in.The Faith and Freedom conference offered an important proving ground for Mr. Trump. Evangelicals are a vital part of the Republican coalition; they voted overwhelmingly Republican in 2012, with 79 percent supporting Mitt Romney, according to Pew Research.But Mr. Trump, a thrice-married Manhattan businessman, does not hew to traditional conservative orthodoxy, and in years past he might have agreed with some of what Mrs. Clinton had to say on Friday about expanding access to prenatal care and safe abortions.During the campaign this year, Mr. Trump, who previously supported abortion rights, said that Planned Parenthood had done some very good work for millions of women and, in response to North Carolinas contentious new law, that transgender people should not face bathroom restrictions.Still, he won the early endorsement of Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the conservative Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., at which Mr. Trump spoke, and successfully wooed evangelical voters, in January.With polls showing Mr. Trump facing a daunting disadvantage against Mrs. Clinton with women and Hispanic voters, he will need robust evangelical turnout in November to close the gap. Despite some Republicans expressing a sense of buyers remorse about Mr. Trump, conservative Christians seem to be sticking with him.Hogan Gidley, who was an aide to former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, said that while evangelicals would love to have a true evangelical in the White House, they understood that Republicans required a broader coalition to win a general election.Republicans cannot win without getting evangelicals, and they cant win only getting evangelicals, Mr. Gidley said. They have to expand the voter universe and, so far, Trump has done an amazing job with that."}
{"text": "The bitter play fares best in ONeill (Unexpected), a program of two nearly forgotten works by Eugene ONeill being produced by the Metropolitan Playhouse. While one piece, a comedy, drums up a few laughs, its the tragedy that packs the real power here.That tragedy, Recklessness, was written in 1913 and had apparently never been staged in ONeills lifetime (1888-1953). In the play, which runs about 35 minutes, Mildred (Erin Beirnard) plans to escape a loveless marriage to a much older husband, Arthur (Kelly King), by running away with her lover, Fred (Jeremy Russial), the couples chauffeur.The plot is melodramatic, the ending blunt. But the intensity of the young writer is palpable. ONeill was enthralled by Strindberg and Ibsen at the time, and it shows. (Its also tempting to compare the story with ONeills fiery life in those years, during which he attempted suicide and was also involved in a love triangle.) This piece stands well enough on its own, though, as Ms. Beirnard conveys a fleeting hope for the future and Mr. King seethes as a betrayed spouse.Now I Ask You, a satire from 1916, finds the writer still entranced by his inspirations, with his characters even name-checking Hedda Gabler during this tale of a fanciful young womans attempts to live a bohemian life by way of an open marriage.The tone is harmless, but theres no getting around the fact that this 90-minute play  which includes a prologue, three acts and an epilogue  wears out its welcome before the halfway mark. In his stage directions, ONeill even calls for a three-minute silence near the end, in which the audience would sit in darkness (something the director, Alex Roe, mercifully omits).Though the piece is overwritten, you wouldnt know it from the dedicated cast, particularly Terrell Wheeler, who is charming as a perplexed husband. Most everything else here is impressive, too  Mr. Roes direction on his own set design, Sidney Fortners costumes  as is usual for this plucky troupe, which revives older American shows on its tiny stage.In the end, these two works are minor asides in a mammoth career. ONeills tragedies would become infinitely deeper, his humor far less strained. But still, listen closely. You can hear hints of great plays to come."}
{"text": "For months, the de Blasio administration has insisted that its top officials knew nothing about deed restrictions that were lifted by a city agency on a nursing home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan  learning of it only in late February, after the building was sold to luxury condominium developers for $116 million.The closing of the home, a former AIDS hospice known as Rivington House, prompted outrage among community leaders, as well as a scramble by city officials to find out how a for-profit company made roughly $72 million and, in the process, replaced a needed nursing center with luxury apartments in a neighborhood already teeming with them.The city halted all new deed modifications in early March. Three investigations began soon after.In a pair of memos obtained by The New York Times, a top official in the de Blasio administration was apprised on the progress in removing the restrictions at Rivington House twice in the middle of 2015  suggesting involvement and coordination by close advisers to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, months earlier than the administration has acknowledged.In the memos the Department of Citywide Administrative Services informed the first deputy mayor, Anthony Shorris, that it was working to remove the restrictions after Allure Group, a for-profit nursing-home company, had agreed to pay the city $16.15 million to do so.The  transactions that resulted in the lifting of the restrictions and the sale of the nursing home to condominium developers are the subject of parallel investigations by the state attorney general, the city comptroller and the citys Investigation Department.Landau seeks to remove the restrictions but intends to use the property as a for-profit nursing home, the departments then-commissioner, Stacey Cumberbatch, wrote to Mr. Shorris in a memo dated May 6, 2015, referring to an owner of the company, Joel Landau. The next step is a public hearing, she added, prior to requesting a mayoral authorization document.After the city removed the restrictions on the property, which barred any use other than as a nonprofit health care center, Allure Group sold the home to the developers in February for $116 million.Officials at City Hall have said that Mr. Shorris did not know until after the sale that the city had lifted all deed restrictions on the property. The first deputy mayor learned of the transaction and the lifting of the full deed restriction in late February, according to background on the deal provided by City Hall in April, after the transactions became public. He did not know D.C.A.S. had lifted the deed restriction for Allure.But in the May memo  and in another on July 8, 2015  Ms. Cumberbatch updated Mr. Shorris as part of a weekly report on items of interest.D.C.A.S. is proceeding to remove two use restrictions that were imposed when the Rivington House property was sold by the city in 1992, the July memo explained, one limiting use to nonprofits, the other to health care providers. The department expects to have a formalized deed modification approved by the Law Department in July, according to the memo, copied to two members of Mr. Shorriss staff.Allure Group went into contract to sell the building to developers on May 11, 2015, the same day that the city ran a public notice in the City Record about the plan to lift the restrictions, and five days after the May memo.Mr. de Blasio has said he did not find out about the questionable deals surrounding Rivington House until he heard about it from the media. City Hall officials have said that Mr. Shorris and others, who were scrambling to address the issue in early March, did not bring it to the mayors attention because they were still gathering facts.The subject also did not come up, City Hall officials have said, during a meeting between Mr. de Blasio and Mark G. Peters, the commissioner of the Investigation Department, at City Hall on March 1, the same day that officials have said the agency began its inquiry. The city also halted all new deed changes that day.Mr. de Blasio has since said that the administration was misled by Allure Group, a contention bolstered early this week by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, described the company as an unscrupulous player whose promises had been broken in prior sales. Mr. Schneidermans office has moved to block any new purchases of nonprofits by Allure Group as the investigation continues.Our responsibility to protect the integrity of ongoing reviews prevents us from commenting on this, said Eric F. Phillips, who was appointed as Mr. de Blasios press secretary on Friday. Asked if the administration was walking back from its previous statement, he said no.The memos, weekly agency reports that are usually circulated as attachments, touched on a number of issues being handled by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services; neither discussed the possibility of converting the nursing home into apartments.A spokeswoman for Allure Group declined to comment.The fate of Rivington House had been a concern for local elected officials and community members who had wanted the building to remain a nursing home. The question of what to do with the building was also discussed by the deputy mayors, including Mr. Shorris, early on in the mayors term, current and former officials have said.It looks like there is movement on the Rivington House issue, wrote Ms. Cumberbatchs chief of staff, Sally Renfro, in an email on Sept. 2, 2014, to the general counsel for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services. She added that a staff member from DM Shorriss office called to ask if there are any other steps required to remove the deed restriction on Rivington House, assuming Village Care pays the appraisal amount, referring to the original nonprofit owner of the home.The city typically sets the value of removing a deed restriction at 12 to 25 percent of the propertys appraised value.But the nonprofit and the city never agreed on a price for lifting the restrictions. Village Care entered into contract in October 2014 to sell the property to Allure Group for $28 million."}
{"text": "LONDON   If there is a dark horse outside of France, Germany or Spain to win the European Championship, Belgium is fancied to be that outside bet.But its team is an enigma. According to FIFA rankings, Belgium stands with Argentina as one of the top two teams in the world  which may tell us all we need to know about relating worth to statistics. What has Belgium or Argentina achieved over the last cycle of the World Cup, the European or the South American titles?And what must Germany or Spain do to achieve recognition for the trophies they won when the tournament pressure was on?Belgians have for some time referred to their current crop of players as the Golden Generation. There was no shortage of big clubs willing to spend lavishly for creative Belgian stars like Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, and strikers like Romelu Lukaku, Christian Benteke and Divock Origi, whose combined transfer fees totaled half a billion dollars.All of those, and the goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and defenders Vincent Kompany, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen earn their fortunes in Englands Premier League.Good attributes for their clubs, no doubt. The conundrum is that when they go home, or when they go to major events for their national team, they havent yet jelled into the sum of their parts.That is Rule 1 in tournament soccer, and on Monday the Belgians must hit the ground running. They face Italy in Lyon, and while this is not by any means a special Italian era, any Azzurri team coached by Antonio Conte will show up with plenty of tournament savvy and determination.When the teams last met, Belgium won 3-1. That was a friendly match in Brussels back in November. Monday it will be down to business in Lyon.And in that arena, the Belgian coach, Marc Wilmots, must pit his wits against Contes. They are two obdurate men. But whereas Conte has shown his effectiveness in organizing Juventus to win three successive Serie A titles in Italy between 2012 and 2014 (and will move to England after this tournament to manage Chelsea), Wilmots has not had comparable coaching success.Indeed, he left soccer altogether for a time to represent the French-speaking center-right Mouvement Rformateur, or Reformist Movement, in the Senate. He soon returned from politics to the game that he once played as a big, forceful, scoring midfielder.For Belgiums Red Devils, Wilmots scored 28 goals in 70 games. The jury is out on him as a coach. He took Belgium to the 2014 World Cup and narrowly beat Algeria, Russia, South Korea and the United States before losing, 1-0, to Argentina in the quarterfinals.Even Wilmots said later that his team would have to be more exciting, and play more to its strength, which lies in attack rather than with caution. The reformer hasnt yet quite got that transition into place.He is bold enough to pick youth, but with key defenders, notably Kompany, out of the Euro through injury, Wilmots lacks a convincing leader on the field.He gave that responsibility to Eden Hazard, who, by any assessment, is a talented individual. Gifted, and beautifully balanced when he runs at defenders from the left wing, Hazard is the enigma inside the enigma.He was Chelseas best player when it won the Premier League under Jos Mourinho the season before last. And Hazard was Chelseas worst player when the team, still coached by Mourinho, imploded the following season.Coincidentally, or not, Hazard was the player who lay injured on the ground and was treated by the team doctor, Eva Carneiro, right at the start of that second season. Carneiro did what doctors are supposed to do when someone is hurt; she rushed to Hazard.Mourinho jumped up and down with rage. He believed Hazard wasnt injured and should have been left where he lay. The coach ranted at the doctor, and had her removed from all duties, leading to her eventually suing Mourinho and Chelsea.The case smoldered throughout the season. Mourinho was himself fired, and the case ended in an out-of-court settlement to the doctor from Chelsea. Mourinho, by then employed again as Manchester Uniteds manager, attended the tribunal but offered no apology.Why is this of significance to Belgiums chances at the European Championship? Hazard was a symbol of Chelsea under Mourinho: One season he was so brilliant that his fellow professionals chose him as the player of the season. The next, he was accused by Mourinho of not defending well enough from his position on the wing; and Hazard appeared dulled by the hectoring he took from the manager, and disillusioned, perhaps, by the fallout from Mourinhos dispute with Carneiro.Yet under Chelseas interim coach, the experienced Dutchman Guus Hiddink, Hazard regained some joy toward the end of the English season. Under Wilmots at the Belgians camp at Le Plan-Mdoc near Bordeaux, France, the winger is scoring again and has been named captain and team spokesman.Wilmots is searching for a leader. The coach needs these players, some of whom he gave their chance for Belgium now almost four years ago. This, for the time being, is a quieter Wilmots than the one who set out to dictate the way his Golden Generation would play.Now, after losing three top defenders in the weeks before the tournament, Wilmots told reporters: Its sad for the boys, but thats life. Even with all these injured players, I have a defense with Toby Alderweireld, Jason Denayer, Thomas Vermaelen and Jan Vertonghen. Its not too bad after all.Ahead of that defense, Belgium has to find a balance, a rhythm and a quicker way of moving the ball between midfield to the strikers than has been the case.Italy will be the first to test Belgiums chances of being the dark horse."}
{"text": "MILWAUKEE  Mets manager Terry Collins believed. Rather than fret about Matt Harveys shaky outings in April and May that had elicited so much angst among Mets fans, Collins took Harveys back-to-back effective starts heading into Friday night as evidence the Dark Knight had emerged from his darkest period.Harvey turned in another strong effort on Friday, allowing one run on two hits in six innings on a steamy night, with eight strikeouts. But as in his previous two starts, the Mets provided little in the way of run support. The Mets managed one run with Harvey in the game and no more until a weird sequence in 11th, scratching one across to beat the Milwaukee Brewers for the second consecutive night, 2-1.Asdrubal Cabrera scored the winner when Brewers shortstop Jonathan Villar, with the bases loaded and one out, dropped Matt Reynoldss liner. Instead of an inning-ending double play, which would have been the third time the Mets had loaded the bases and failed to score, Villar got only one out, tagging Kelly Johnson between first and second.Reynolds was as baffled as anyone by the play.All I know is, I hit a line drive to short, and I wasnt out, he said. Honestly, I thought it was a double play. I was just standing right there waiting for them to make a decision. I was just lucky it wasnt a double play.Its tough to explain right now, he added. Im still trying to figure out what happened.Collins was willing to take the stroke of luck.Ive seen a lot of major league baseball games, he said. That might have been one of the wildest Ive ever been involved in. You just take the win and go get ready for tomorrow. You dont try to analyze that one.Matty was good again. Were certainly on the upside of that. Thats good to see.Five Mets relievers combined to allow one hit over the final five innings, with Jeurys Familia closing for his 21st consecutive save.After scoring 11 runs over the last two games, a hopeful sign, the Mets offense struggled again on Friday. The first run came on a sixth-inning homer by Yoenis Cespedes, his 16th, ending a stretch, dating to May 23, of 52 at-bats without one. The Mets left the bases loaded in the fifth, while the game was still scoreless, and again in the ninth after the first three batters reached base. In Harveys last three starts, the Mets have scored only two runs while he was pitching.Harvey appeared especially sharp early, mixing his pitches while retiring the first six batters, four on swinging strikeouts.I feel much better, Harvey said. My fastball wasnt coming out as great as it has been the last couple of starts, but I pretty much had everything else working, and was able to keep them off-balance.The Brewers briefly appeared to have scored a run in the third on a quirky play that required two replay reviews, covering almost six minutes, to resolve.With Aaron Hill on second and two out, a Villar grounder struck Harvey in the foot and caromed toward the left side of the infield. Cabrera, the Mets shortstop, headed toward the middle but scrambled back in a change of direction to knock down the ball just short of the outfield grass. Villar slid home ahead of Cabreras throw, and the plate umpire Larry Vanover, the crew chief, emphatically called him safe.Collins challenged the call, which was reversed following a 3 minute 1 second deliberation. Then Milwaukee Manager Craig Counsell asked Vanover to review whether Mets catcher Kevin Plawecki had blocked the plate. Two minutes 49 seconds later, the out call stood, keeping the game scoreless.Johnson, in his first appearance since the Mets acquired him from Atlanta for the second consecutive season, doubled in the third. With a big secondary lead, Johnson couldnt scramble back quickly enough on Harveys grounder up the middle. Villar tagged Johnson and threw to first for an inning-ending double play.The Mets loaded the bases in the fifth on two singles, Harveys sacrifice and an intentional walk to Curtis Granderson, who was passed despite his .091 average with runners in scoring position. Alejandro De Aza grounded out, stranding them all.The former Met Kirk Nieuwenhuis tripled and scored the games first run in the fifth. The lead lasted only three pitches into the sixth, when Cespedes homered to left-center. Nieuwenhuis stole Johnsons bid for a go-ahead homer in the sixth with a leaping catch at the center-field wall.The Brewers put two on with Hansel Robles pitching in the seventh, but Cespedes in center and De Aza in left ran down fly balls on the warning track.In the ninth, the Mets wasted a glorious opportunity, with Wilmer Flores and Johnson following Cabreras leadoff walk with singles, putting the go-ahead run 90 feet away with nobody out.With about 100 Mets fans near the third-base dugout chanting, Lets go, Mets! (and the remaining Brewers fans at Miller Park booing), Milwaukee second baseman Scooter Gennett ran down Plaweckis pop-up in shallow right, the runners holding. Pinch-hitter Neil Walker took a 1-2 curveball from Jeremy Jeffress for strike three, and Granderson grounded out to second.Mets reliever Jim Henderson walked two in the ninth, but Milwaukee couldnt capitalize, leaving runners on second and third. In the 10th, Milwaukees Ramon Flores overslid third on a ball in the dirt and was tagged out, a call upheld on video review."}
{"text": "For a golf course considered one of the most arduous in the country, the 18 holes at Oakmont Country Club, which will host the United States Open for a record ninth time starting Thursday, lack many of the most fundamental golf-design elements.There are no ponds, lakes, streams or brooks adorning the holes at Oakmont, in western Pennsylvania. In the last dozen years, more than 14,000 trees have been removed from the grounds. A majority of the holes are straightforward, arcing neither left nor right in traditional doglegs.There is, however, one idiosyncratic feature of Oakmont that is unlike any other regularly seen in American major championship golf. Since the course opened for play in 1904, Oakmont has had deep, quirky and vexing drainage ditches that can affect the play on as many as 10 holes.The ditches, waist high in some places, were a functional and architecturally strategic element of the original layout, funneling rainwater off the course while simultaneously ensnaring the wayward golf ball into a shadowy abyss.Technically, the ditches are considered Oakmonts only water hazards, even if the fast-moving groundwater rarely remains in the trenched channels long enough to puddle. But a golf hazard can come in many forms as long as it lurks to unnerve and exasperate an inattentive golfer. And for 112 years, many a pleasing round has lost its promise in the bottom, or sloped side, of an Oakmont ditch.I dont know if theres any golf course that has anything quite like these ditches, said Mike Davis, the executive director of the United States Golf Association, which conducts the United States Open. Theyre water hazards, but unlike most water hazards, you can see your ball and maybe get your ball out.Although that is not a sure thing, either.Undeniably, it is the riddle of the nonwater water hazard that makes an Oakmont ditch such a distinctive golf conundrum.Most balls that land in typical water hazards are submerged, so the golfer is routinely forced to take a stroke penalty and play on. But Oakmonts virtually dry water hazards, while rugged and often steep, are covered in a layer of fine fescue grass that can invite a player to ponder a penalty-free recovery.Why waste a stroke if it is possible to knock the ball to a better spot on the golf course  if not the green?Mentally, golfers get tricked, said John Zimmers, Oakmonts longtime course superintendent. They think: Hey, my golf ball is right there. I can get a club on that.But trying to play it out creates all kinds of havoc.Or, as Paul Azinger, the lead golf analyst for Fox Sports and a 12-time winner on the PGA Tour, said, Sometimes youre just unwilling to give up a shot.Azinger conceded that most times the wise choice at Oakmont would be to take the punishment of a one-stroke penalty. But he also said that the ditches could be especially irksome.It can affect your attitude if your ball is hopping along and just goes in the ditches instead of hopping over them, Azinger said. Theyre in play, and theyre very frustrating.The fescue in the ditches is wispy and unpredictable. The lie, most likely uneven, is treacherous. One swing might send the ball into another section of the ditch and bury it deeper still. Now what?Im telling you, Zimmers said, if there were water in those ditches, they wouldnt be as difficult.Oakmonts roughly 700 members have learned their lesson.The ditches are a pain in the butt, but most of us know that were better off just taking a drop and the penalty, said Gerry Hickel, a member of Oakmonts archive committee and one of the clubs historians. We do that seven out of 10 times, at least.That may be the course chosen by recreational golfers, but golfers on the PGA Tour have exceptional skills and will not be so quick to turn away from a challenge.As good as they are, there might be a belief that they can get their ball out, Davis said. There will be some players who try that and do not get it out. But there will be others who hit it out and well all be saying, That was spectacular. Davis, in fact, said he believed that in some cases a player whose ball tumbled into a ditch would still be able to advance it 100 or 150 yards. When was the last time that happened from a water hazard?Thats what makes the ditches so strategically fascinating, Davis said. Yes, standing on a tee at Oakmont, you dont see an ocean or a pond or lake. But you know the ditches are out there. Sometimes they are literally right beside the fairway.Curtis Strange, the last golfer to win back-to-back United States Open championships and who will be a Fox Sports on-course reporter during this months tournament, said the players were indeed cognizant of the placement of every prominent ditch because they are so punitive.Theyre narrow enough that if you get into one, and get lucky enough for a lie, you never have a stance, said Strange, who finished fourth at the United States Open held at Oakmont in 1994.While the Oakmont ditches were plainly drawn on the earliest sketches of the golf course, many remain in places that might capture the drive of only a hacker, not a top professional golfer. But on many other holes, the ditches are unquestionably in play for anyone trying to navigate Oakmonts layout, which is punishing for a variety of other reasons, most notably for lightning-fast greens and, perhaps, the most intimidating bunkers in American championship golf.Asked to list certain holes where a ditch or ditches would most likely come into play, Davis last week mentioned the second and ninth holes, where there are ditches alongside the left side of the fairway; the 12th hole, where balls in the drive zone and the layup area may have to skirt a ditch; and the 18th hole, where there is a ditch left of the drive zone.In general, Oakmonts ditches, some of them cut across fairways, will have to be contemplated, respected and avoided in every round at the 116th United States Open.That has been the case since golf was first played on the site, a former pasture until teams of mules and horses reconfigured the landscape.And the ditches have been here since Day 1, Davis said. They were always central to the architecture and to the strategy of playing the golf course.At a golf course that is not overly devious, the ditches are the places where an apparently decent shot can trickle into a seemingly benign position. Nevertheless, what follows is often a thorough unraveling.The last time the United States Open was at Oakmont, in 2007, Stephen Ames, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, shared the lead in the opening stages of the final round. On the par-4 No. 7, Ames hooked his tee shot into a ditch, tried to hit his ball out and eventually walked away with a triple bogey.Ames never threatened the tournament leaders again, eventually shooting 76. He tied for 10th."}
{"text": "This article originally appeared in The New York Times on April 29, 1967.HOUSTON  Cassius Clay refused today, as expected, to take the one step forward that would have constituted his induction into the armed forces. There was no immediate Government action.Although Government authorities here foresaw several months of preliminary moves before Clay would be arrested and charged with a felony, boxing organizations instantly stripped the 25-year-old fighter of his world heavyweight championship.It will take at least 30 days for Clay to be indicted and it probably will be another year and a half before he could be sent to prison since there undoubtedly will be appeals through the courts, United States Attorney Morton Susman said.Clay, in a statement distributed a few minutes after the announcement of his refusal, said:I have searched my conscience and I find I cannot be true to my belief in my religion by accepting such a call. He has maintained throughout recent unsuccessful civil litigation that he is entitled to draft exemption as an appointed minister of the Lost-Found Nation of Islam, the so-called Black Muslim sect.Clay, who prefers his Muslim name of Muhammad Ali, anticipated the moves against his title in his statement, calling them a continuation of the same artificially induced prejudice and discrimination that had led to the defeat of his various suits and appeals in Federal courts, including the Supreme Court.Hayden C. Covington of New York, Clays lawyer, said that further civil action to stay criminal proceedings would be initiated. If convicted of refusal to submit to induction, Clay is subject to a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.Mr. Covington, who has defended many Jehovahs Witnesses in similar cases, has repeatedly told Clay during the last few days, Youll be unhappy in the fiery furnace of criminal proceedings but youll come out unsinged.As a plaintiff in a civil action, the Negro fighter has touched on such politically and socially explosive areas as alleged racial imbalance on local Texas draft boards, alleged discriminatory action by the Government in response to public pressure, and the rights of a minority religion to appoint clergymen.As a prospective defendant in criminal proceedings, Clay is expected to attempt to establish that preaching and teaching the tenets of the Muslims is a full-time occupation and that boxing is the avocation that financially supports his unpaid ministerial duties.Today, Clay reported to the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station on the third floor of the Federally drab United States Custom House a few minutes before 8 a.m., the ordered time. San Jacinto Street, in downtown Houston, was already crowded with television crews and newsmen when Clay stepped out of a taxi cab with Covington, Quinnan Hodges, the local associate counsel, and Chauncey Eskridge of Chicago, a lawyer for the Rev. Martin Luther King, as well as for Clay and others.Half a dozen Negro men, apparently en route to work, applauded Clay and shouted: He gets more publicity than Johnson. Clay was quickly taken upstairs and disappeared into the maw of the induction procedure for more than five hours.Two information officers supplied a stream of printed and oral releases throughout the procedure, including a detailed schedule of examinations and records processing, as well as instant confirmation of Clays acceptable blood test and the fact that he had obeyed Muslim dietary strictures by passing up the ham sandwich included in the inductees box lunches.Such information, however, did not forestall the instigation, by television crews, of a small demonstration outside the Custom House. During the morning, five white youngsters from the Friends World Institute, a nonaccredited school in Westbury, L.I., who had driven all night from a study project in Oklahoma, and half a dozen local Negro youths, several wearing Black Power buttons, had appeared on the street.Continuous and sometimes insulting interviewers eventually provoked both groups, separately, to appear with signs. The white group merely asked for the end of the Vietnam War and greater efforts for civil rights.The Negroes eventually swelled into a group of about two dozen circling pickets carrying hastily scrawled Burn, Baby, Burn signs and singing, Nothing kills a nigger like too much love. A few of the pickets wore discarded bedsheets and table linen wound into African-type garments, but most were young women dragged into the little demonstration on their lunch hours.There was a touch of sadness and gross exaggeration throughout the most widely observed noninduction in history. At breakfast this morning in the Hotel America, Clay had stared out a window into a dingy, cold morning and said: Every time I fight it gets cold and rainy. Then dingy and cool, no sun in sight nowhere.He had shrugged when Mr. Hodges had showed him an anonymously sent newspaper clipping in which a photograph of the local associate counsel had been marked Houstons great nigger lawyer.Sadly, too, 22-year-old John McCullough, a graduate of Sam Houston State College, said: Its his prerogative if hes sincere in his religion, but its his duty as a citizen to go in. Im a coward, too.Then Mr. McCullough, who is white, went up the steps to be inducted. He was one of the 46 young men, including Clay, who were called to report on this day.For Clay, the day ended at 1:10 p.m. Houston time, when Lt. Col. J. Edwin McKee, commander of the station, announced that Mr. Muhammad Ali has just refused to be inducted.In a prepared statement, Colonel McKee said that notification of the refusal would be forwarded to the United States Attorney Generals office, and the national and local Selective Service boards. This is the first administrative step toward possible arrest, and an injunction to stop it had been denied to Clay yesterday in the United States District Court here.Clay was initially registered for the draft in Louisville, where he was born. He obtained a transfer to a Houston board because his ministerial duties had made this city his new official residence. He had spent most of his time until last summer in Chicago, where the Muslim headquarters are situated, in Miami, where he trained, or in the cities in which he was fighting.After Colonel McKees brief statement, Clay was brought into a pressroom and led into range of 13 television cameras and several dozen microphones. He refused to speak as he handed out Xeroxed copies of his statement to selected newsmen, including representatives of the major networks, wire services and The New York Times.The statement thanked those instrumental in his boxing career as well as those who have offered support and guidance, including Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Muslims, Mohammed Oweida, Secretary General of the High Council for Islamic Affairs, and Floyd McKissick, president of the Congress of Racial Equality.The statement, in part, declared:It is in the light of my consciousness as a Muslim minister and my own personal convictions that I take my stand in rejecting the call to be inducted in the armed services. I do so with the full realization of its implications and possible consequences. I have searched my conscience and I find I cannot be true to my belief in my religion by accepting such a call.My decision is a private and individual one and I realize that this is a most crucial decision. In taking it I am dependent solely upon Allah as the final judge of those actions brought about by my own conscience.I strongly object to the fact that so many newspapers have given the American public and the world the impression that I have only two alternatives in taking this stand: either I go to jail or go to the Army. There is another alternative and that alternative is justice. If justice prevails, if my Constitutional rights are upheld, I will be forced to go neither to the Army nor jail. In the end I am confident that justice will come my way for the truth must eventually prevail I am looking forward to immediately continuing my profession.As to the threat voiced by certain elements to strip me of my title, this is merely a continuation of the same artificially induced prejudice and discrimination.Regardless of the difference in my outlook, I insist upon my right to pursue my livelihood in accordance with the same rights granted to other men and women who have disagreed with the policies of whatever Administration was in power at the time.I have the world heavyweight title not because it was given to me, not because of my race or religion, but because I won it in the ring through my own boxing ability.Those who want to take it and hold a series of auction-type bouts not only do me a disservice but actually disgrace themselves. I am certain that the sports fans and fair-minded people throughout America would never accept such a titleholder.Clay returned to his hotel and went to sleep after the days activities. He is expected to leave the city, possibly for Washington, in the morning."}

{"text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.  Muhammad Ali spent the better part of a decade planning his funeral, his friends and family said, and by late Friday afternoon it was evident what had taken him so long. In a spectacle that fanned across miles of his hometown, in memories that stretched over some of 20th-century Americas most turbulent years, and in prayers from the palette of faiths that he honored as paths to truth, he was laid to rest, one week after his death at age 74.Ali was eulogized in a grand sports arena by, among others, a priest and an imam, a rabbi and a monk, a former United States president and a famous comedian. Protges and daughters and his wife remembered him. As they spoke, all stood beneath the flags of the United States and the Olympic Games, symbols of a man who saw himself as a citizen of America and of the world.Earlier in the day, his coffin traveled through nearly 20 miles of Louisville, cheered and saluted by tens of thousands of people who tossed flowers onto the hearse and chanted his name. On Thursday, a traditional Muslim ceremony was held here as a prelude to Fridays embrace.It was all part of a leave-taking that Ali had seen as a chance to lead once more by including Christians, Jews, Buddhists and Native Americans as speakers in an emphatic, if not explicitly spoken, renunciation of sectarianism and embrace of ecumenism.Muhammad indicated that when the end came for him, he wanted to use his life and his death as a teaching moment, Alis widow, Lonnie, said. He was 12 years old when his bicycle was stolen, she noted, and a police officer encouraged him to learn boxing. Teachers believed in him. Friends backed his career.Named the athlete of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated, Ali never settled for sportsman as his sole identity. Among the first speakers at the memorial was the Rev. Kevin Cosby of St. Stephen Church in Louisville, who said Ali had taken his place in history by rejecting the narrative of a country that had, from its earliest days, refused to recognize African-Americans as fully human and full citizens. That mattered because of the times he lived in, Dr. Cosby said, the context that helped define him just as the American Revolution had for George Washington and the Great Depression for Franklin D. Roosevelt.He dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves, Dr. Cosby said. He dared to affirm the beauty of blackness, he dared to affirm the power and the capacity of African-Americans. He dared to love Americas most unloved race.President Obama, in Washington for his daughters high school graduation, sent a letter that said Alis example had inspired him to think how far he might one day go himself.Ali was a radical, even in the most radical of times, Mr. Obama wrote, in a letter read by his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. A loud, and proud, and unabashedly black voice in a Jim Crow world. His jabs knocked some sense into us, pushing us to expand our imagination.Billy Crystal, a young and struggling comedian when he became friends with Ali, said the boxer had invited him to go for a training run one morning at a country club. Mr. Crystal said he explained that the club excluded Jews. Ali, he said, was incensed to learn this, saying, Im a black Muslim, and they let me run.Ali never ran at that club again, Mr. Crystal said. He remembered, as well, that the silver-tongued Ali had lost his speech to illness in recent years, but that he continued to be a powerful force on humanitarian missions.Ultimately, he became a silent messenger for peace, who taught us that life is best when you build bridges between people, not walls, Mr. Crystal said.Drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, Ali said his faith could not countenance a combat role, and Ms. Ali noted that he refused to leave the country even though his stance cost him his boxing title and put him in jeopardy of prison. Mr. Crystal said Ali had set an example.There were millions of young men my age, eligible for the draft for a war we didnt believe in, Mr. Crystal said. It was Ali who stood up for us by standing up for himself.Viewed through the lens of history, Alis stance on the Vietnam War is now widely seen as principled; at the time, he was denounced. Dr. Cosby noted that at the Kentucky Derby, gamblers cannot bet on a horse once it has reached the winners circle.There were a lot of people who would bet on Muhammad Ali when he was in the winners circle, Dr. Crosby said. But the masses bet on him while he was still in the mud.Close to 20,000 people were in the KFC Yum Center arena for the memorial, which lasted more than three hours, with 13 speakers in addition to members of the clergy who prayed and chanted.If the spectacle in the arena was global, the scenes on the roughly 19-mile procession were strictly local, pulsing with pride for a native son. Alis ties to the compact, quirky city of his youth never frayed. All business halted as workers streamed to the sidewalk to stand vigil in gently chaotic decorum.Its almost like were extended cousins, said Andrea Meriwether, 31, a native of Louisville, who was taught pool by Alis younger brother, Rahman Ali. I cant think of anyone from here who hasnt met him or had some connection.Along Broadway in the heart of downtown, those extended cousins, and other branches of the human family, stood eight and 10 deep on both sides of the street for blocks. With no pens to corral them on the sidewalk, the crowds seeped onto the roadway.Everyone has a story, said Mark Collins, 54, who recalled working in a bank when Ali, then in his magic-trick phase, performed an illusion of levitation.An especially jammed point was the corner where Broadway meets South Fourth Street, a central shopping and dining street. Now featuring chiseled atriums, it was a street where the young Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, would not have been allowed into the cafeterias of the department stores.Among those near that spot on Friday was Carolyn Miller-Cooper, the executive director of the citys Human Relations Commission. In Louisville, it was always a polite racism, Ms. Miller-Cooper said. You couldnt go in and try on clothes. Children had to trace their foot on a sheet of paper for parents to bring to the store and try to buy the right-sized shoes.For many in the crowd, Alis stature as a boxer was something they had heard about, a piece of history they had not lived; the appreciation of the man was for the place he claimed in the world.I wasnt around for those titles, said Rodrecruz Hines, 32, an autoworker who held a single red rose as he waited. To me, he had this charismatic character, and he stood up for our rights, for the rights of young black men.As the hearse approached, chants of Ali! Ali! Ali! rose. People swarmed forward to toss flowers onto the hearse. Riding with the windows down, people in the limousines, including members of the Ali family, the actor Will Smith, and the mayor, Greg Fischer, slapped hands with the spectators as they passed.Ali returned often to Louisville, and Ms. Miller-Cooper, who serves on the board of the citys Muhammad Ali Center, saw him at a gala for the center last fall, with Ms. Ali tending to him. Ms. Miller-Coopers admiration for both of them grew as he continued a public life, even if physically diminished.He was pretty frail, but he was still out there, shining a light on Parkinsons, she said. I think that was what showed he was the greatest  that he continued to live, not hide."}
{"text": "Gordie Howe was known to generations of players and fans as Mr. Hockey.But after his death at age 88, many in the hockey world were remembering him as something else: Mr. Nice Guy.For all the tales of Howes on-ice toughness  the elbows, the hard checks  it was his unassuming kindness off the ice that so many recalled.Unfortunately, we lost the greatest hockey player ever today, but more importantly, the nicest man I have ever met, Wayne Gretzky, hockeys Great One, wrote on Twitter.The word gentleman was used again and again by those around hockey to describe Howe.A great player in a sport that is our favorite sport in this country, Brendan Shanahan, a former Red Wings player who is now the president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, told The Toronto Star. Then, on the flip side, when he got off the ice, he was a kind gentleman.Tony Granato, a former Red Wings assistant coach, called Howe a gentleman, a true gentleman and the nicest man you could ever meet.That was not to say that hockey people were not still marveling at Howes accomplishments  26 seasons in the N.H.L. and six more in the World Hockey Association, across five decades. He held the goal-scoring record until Gretzky came along.I pick Gordie as my No. 1 all-time player, said Scotty Bowman, who won nine Stanley Cups as a coach, including three with Detroit.Barry Melrose, a former player and current broadcaster, recalled on ESPN, He was a guy who would hurt you physically, and score two goals to beat you.Noting that Howe had recorded 41 points in his final season, 1979-80, at age 52, Melrose added: Its mind-boggling how long he played. The guy was just a freak of nature to be playing that good at that age.Howe still holds the N.H.L. record for regular-season games played, with 1,767 over 26 seasons. The league plans to honor Howe before Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals in San Jose, Calif., on Sunday night.Gordies toughness as a competitor on the ice was equaled only by his humor and humility away from it., N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. No sport could have hoped for a greater, more beloved ambassador.Few were surprised by Howes passing. He had received a diagnosis of dementia in 2012 and had a serious stroke in 2014.Nevertheless, the news hit his hometown, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, hard. Flags in the city  which is near Floral, the small unincorporated town where Howe was born  were flying at half-staff on Friday. A banner with Howes No. 9 was flying over the citys ice arena, where fans were leaving flowers, cards, teddy bears and other mementos at a statue of Howe.Theres a real feeling of sadness in the city because, even though Gordie played in Detroit, we still know he was from here, and he always kept that connection to Saskatoon and still has family here, said Kevin Mitchell, a reporter at The StarPhoenix, the citys daily newspaper.Howes stature loomed over the Detroit Red Wings, for whom he played 25 seasons, beginning in 1946, and won four Stanley Cups.In Detroit, some Red Wings fans gathered at Joe Louis Arena, the stadium named for the only other local athlete who can stand with Howe in the estimation of many Detroiters.Calls poured into radio shows remembering Howe, mostly for his on-ice exploits. John Bacon, a best-selling sportswriter, eulogized Howe for National Public Radio, crediting him for playing a key role in popularizing hockey in the United States.When he was in his heyday, it was Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr and Bobby Hull, Bacon said. When those three guys were playing, rinks started popping up where they were playing.In Bacons view, that laid the groundwork for the 1980 Miracle on Ice.Speaking in Detroit, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said Howe had been both a gentleman and a tough guy  the best of what Canadians like to think of themselves as.From Washington, President Obama said in a statement that Howes perseverance and humility personified Detroit.The greatest players define their game for a generation; over more than half a century on the ice, Mr. Hockey defined it for a lifetime, Obama said.After Howes playing days were over, he was a regular visitor to Red Wings games and team events, including charity fund-raisers and Stanley Cup celebrations.He embodied, on and off the ice, what it meant to be both a Red Wing and a Detroiter, the Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch said in a statement. He was tough, skilled, and consistently earned success at the highest level.Granato, who played for the Rangers, the Los Angeles Kings and the San Jose Sharks, remembered the effect of Howes presence.Hed come to Joe Louis, and when the guys heard he was in the building, everyone perked up, Granato said. Im thankful I had the chance to shake his hand a few times.Once, when Granato was in Detroit as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins, he noticed Howe outside the visitors dressing room and introduced himself.He was surprised that Howe, a giant of the game, politely asked whether Granato might do him a favor.Do you think I can go back and say hi to the kid? Howe asked, referring to Pittsburghs then-budding star, Sidney Crosby.The news of Howes death spread quickly among former Red Wings players, who, no matter what era they played in, seemed to come to know him.Dave Shand, who played hockey at the University of Michigan and broke into the N.H.L. in 1976, while Howe was still playing, said emails with news of Howes death had spread rapidly among former Red Wings players Friday morning.Shand recalled going up against Howe in a game in 1979, and Howe giving Shand an elbow to the face. The moment of impact was caught by a photographer.It literally looked like half my face was pushed in, Shand said with a laugh.Years later, after a stint with the Wings, Shand came to know Howe fairly well, and they used to joke about the play.He was the most approachable superstar youd ever run into, Shand said. He never made you feel like you were bothering him."}
{"text": "HARBIN, China  Six years ago, Wang Huanming was paralyzed from the neck down after being injured wrestling with a friend. Today, he hopes he has found the answer to walking again: a new body for his head.Mr. Wang, a 62-year-old retired gas company worker, is one of several people in China who have volunteered for a body transplant at a hospital in the northern Chinese city of Harbin.The idea for a body transplant is the kind of thinking that has experts around the world alarmed at how far China is pushing the ethical and practical limits of science. Such a transplant is impossible, at least for now, according to leading doctors and experts, including some in China, who point to the difficulty of connecting nerves in the spinal cord. Failure would mean the death of the patient.The orthopedic surgeon proposing the operation, Dr. Ren Xiaoping of Harbin Medical University, who assisted in the first hand transplant in the United States in 1999, said he would not be deterred. In an interview, Dr. Ren said that he was building a team, that research was underway and that the operation would take place when we are ready.His plan: Remove two heads from two bodies, connect the blood vessels of the body of the deceased donor and the recipient head, insert a metal plate to stabilize the new neck, bathe the spinal cord nerve endings in a gluelike substance to aid regrowth and finally sew up the skin.Whether or not he performs the operation, leading medical experts have condemned the plan.For most people, its at best premature and at worst reckless, said Dr. James L. Bernat, a professor of neurology and medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine of Dartmouth College.Dr. Huang Jiefu, a former deputy minister of health in China, said in an interview in November that when the spine is cut, the neurons cannot be reconnected, so its scientifically impossible.Ethically its impossible, Dr. Huang added. How can you put one persons head on anothers body?Critics attribute such medical experimentation in China to national ambition, generous state funding, a utilitarian worldview that prioritizes results, and a lack of transparency and accountability to the outside world.The Chinese system is not transparent in any way, said Arthur L. Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University. I do not trust Chinese bioethical deliberation or policy. Add healthy doses of politics, national pride and entrepreneurship, and it is tough to know what is going on.Some Chinese researchers are also concerned that the experimentation is going too far, too fast.I dont want to see Chinas scholars, transplant doctors and scientists deepening the impression that people have of us internationally, that when Chinese people do things they have no bottom line  that anything goes, said Cong Yali, a medical ethicist at Peking University, referring to Dr. Rens plans.The Chinese government invested 1.42 trillion renminbi ($216 billion) in scientific research and development last year, compared with 245 billion renminbi in 2005, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Last year, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University, in the southern city of Guangzhou, altered a gene in the human embryo that causes thalassemia, a rare blood disease, using a technique developed in the United States. The experiment crossed an  ethical line, some scientists in China and abroad said, because the changes would be inheritable if conducted on viable embryos. (The experiment used unviable embryos.) That could pave the way for permanent gene modification for qualities such as looks or intelligence.Despite the concerns, in April another team in Guangzhou altered embryos to make them H.I.V. resistant. Internationally, some scientists criticized the experiment, citing a lack of consensus on the ethics of such work.The team, from Guangzhou Medical University, said that significant technical issues remain to be addressed. It added that on ethical grounds it would not advocate genome editing on viable lines until after a rigorous and thorough evaluation and discussion are undertaken by the global research and ethics communities.Ethical issues have long dogged Chinese researchers in the field of organ transplants, where China was an international pariah for using the organs of executed prisoners. While China says it no longer uses those, Chinese transplant doctors still sometimes submit research from prisoner organs to international conferences, which is not permitted under global ethical norms.This year, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation said it had rejected research by a Chinese team at its annual meeting, in Washington, on those grounds.Some Chinese scientists and ethicists say the concerns of medical experts, especially those overseas, are overblown. They attribute them to envy at Chinas remarkable scientific and economic progress in recent decades.We see the reactions among Western commentators as a misunderstanding of the current situation, Zhai Xiaomei, the dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Peking Union Medical College, wrote in the journal Developing World Bioethics in January.Critics were unwilling to acknowledge China as an equal partner in the international debate about proper limits to the development of new biotechnologies, she wrote. Ms. Zhai declined to be interviewed.Dr. Ren is not the only one exploring the science of body transplants. Dr. Sergio Canavero of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group in Italy, is a prominent advocate, and scientists at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics at the Russian Academy of Sciences are also researching aspects of the procedure. Neither Dr. Canavero nor the Russian institute has plans to carry it out, though, they say.Dr. Ren, a native of Harbin, spent 16 years in the United States before returning home in 2012. He was part of a team from the University of Louisville that assisted in the hand transplant. He later moved to the University of Cincinnati, according to the website of the universitys Academic Health Center.Dr. Ren has experimented with head transplants on mice, but they have lived only for a day. He said he had also begun practicing on human cadavers, but declined to give details.The doctor and his supporters say the operation could help people with potentially fatal diseases affecting body function, such as spinal muscular atrophy, as well as those with paralysis like Mr. Wang.Some aspects of the plan are technically possible, said Dr. Abraham Shaked, a professor of surgery and the director of the Penn Transplant Institute at the University of Pennsylvania. He said it could be possible to preserve the recipients brain and the donors body before transplant, attach many of the blood vessels and muscles, and control adverse immune reactions.But it is still not possible to connect the nerves of the spinal cord, Dr. Shaked said.At this stage, I would call the attempt stupid rather than crazy, he said in an email. Crazy means it may be done. Stupid should not be done.As for using the gluelike substance, polyethylene glycol, to facilitate the growth of nerve endings, Dr. Shaked said, Put it this way: It is like if the trans-Atlantic phone cable is cut by half, and someone wants to put it together using Krazy Glue.Dr. Ren agrees that it would be stupendously difficult.Ive been practicing medicine in China and overseas for more than 30 years, he said in an interview. Ive done the most complicated operations. But compared to this one, theres no comparison.Whether its ethical or not, this is a persons life, he added. There is nothing higher than a life, and thats the core of ethics.Asked to comment, Chinas Health Commission said surgeons were required to abide by ethical responsibilities outlined in the nations human organ transplant regulations.Amid the medical and ethical uncertainties, Mr. Wang and his family cling to hope.For three years, his daughter, Wang Zhi, 34, and her mother hand-pumped oxygen into his lungs. Today, they have an automatic pump paid for by donations. But medical bills have used up their savings, Ms. Wang said.He cannot live, and he cannot die, she said.The family knows that if the operation fails, Mr. Wang will die. But it gives them hope amid their desperation.A medical procedure that sounds impossible may save us, Ms. Wang said."}
{"text": "PERTH, Australia  The search for Malaysia Airlines missing Flight 370 on the floor of the southern Indian Ocean is nearing an end with no sign of the plane in the area that investigators had concluded it most likely went down, prompting a last-ditch reassessment of assumptions used to calculate its final descent and draw the search zone.At issue are estimates of how far the plane may have traveled after it ran out of fuel, notably whether it followed a tight or broad spiral down as it fell or glided toward the ocean, officials said.Were really doing further work to test our assumption about the end of flight, which defines our search area, said Martin Dolan, the chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Its really testing to make sure we havent missed anything, and that our assumptions remain valid.The failure to find any wreckage in the area also raises the possibility that the plane began descending earlier, or perhaps changed course in an attempt at an emergency landing at sea, though investigators have discounted these outcomes as inconsistent with other evidence.There is still hope that the plane will be found in the search zone, an expanse of 46,000 square miles, about the size of England. But ocean survey vessels have scoured about 90 percent of the area and are expected to finish the rest in August. Unless new information emerges, that is when the governments of Australia, Malaysia and China plan to abandon the search, leaving one of the greatest mysteries in the history of modern aviation unsolved.Flight 370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, carrying 239 passengers and crew members from 15 nations. An analysis of radar and satellite communications data determined that the Boeing 777-200 made several turns and then flew south for five hours with little deviation. But investigators never pinpointed where the plane ran out of fuel.Instead, they identified a 400-mile arc from which the plane most likely sent its last satellite signal. Survey vessels have been going back and forth at walking speed across that swath of the southern Indian Ocean for two years, using sonar devices towed over the seafloor to scan the Stygian depths more than two miles below the waves.Investigators are now asking whether they have been looking in the right place. They are reconsidering an assumption that when the planes engines ran dry, the aircraft spiraled into the sea without traveling a horizontal distance of more than 10 nautical miles  a relatively tight spiral.Analysts at Boeing and elsewhere have been re-examining their models of how the aircraft operating under autopilot might have responded to an initial loss of power on one side of the aircraft, and, up to 15 minutes later, on both sides. The simulations assume the right engine ran out of fuel first, because over its years of service that engine on the aircraft had tended to burn slightly more fuel than the left engine, according to records from Rolls-Royce, the engines manufacturer.The three countries bankrolling the search for the missing Boeing 777-200 agreed in April last year not to expand the search area unless new information provided clear clues that the plane was somewhere else.So far, no evidence has emerged that would justify an expanded search, Mr. Dolan said.While the search for Flight 370 is already the largest and most costly in aviation history, relatives of passengers on the plane have called for it to be extended, as have many scientists, pilots, hobbyists and others mesmerized by the mystery of its disappearance.There is no reason we should give up the search  at least they have to give us an answer, said Steve Wang, a technology company salesman in Beijing who has served as an unofficial spokesman for the families and whose 57-year-old mother was on the plane. Everything about MH370 remains a mystery  what happened, and how?The search zone was calculated using the last automatic signal sent by the aircrafts engines to a satellite right before it disappeared. The signal indicated that the satellite system had been reset, suggesting a power failure, possibly caused by the engines running out of fuel.Though the signal did not include location data, analysis of the time it took the transmission to travel to and from the satellite led investigators to focus on the 400-mile arc.But Duncan Steel, a scientist on a panel of experts that has advised the Australian government, said the arc might have been drawn too far south. Investigators have assumed the plane was at cruising altitude when it sent its last signal, he said, but if the plane had started descending earlier as it ran low on fuel, it would have covered less distance before it hit the ocean.Investigators said on May 12 that two pieces of debris recovered in March from South Africa and from Rodrigues Island, part of Mauritius, were almost certainly from the missing plane. But neither part  a piece of the interior panel in the main cabin and a piece of engine covering  provided significant information about the aircrafts final location.Australias minister of infrastructure and transport, Darren Chester, announced on May 26 that two more pieces of debris had been found in Mauritius and another in Mozambique that would also be examined for possible links to the missing aircraft.The Australian government said on Friday that four more pieces of debris, three found on Madagascar and one on a southern Australian island, would be checked to determine whether they came from the missing plane.Three other pieces linked to the plane were discovered on African beaches last year and early this year. One was identified as clearly belonging to the right wing, while another was identified as almost certainly coming from the right wing and a third as almost certainly coming from the right side of the tail.The accumulation of parts from the aircrafts right side has led some to suggest that the plane may have changed course before it crashed, possibly under the control of a conscious pilot.In theory, a pilot could have attempted an emergency landing by turning the plane and trying to land it just behind an ocean swell, before the next swell arrived.One of the many risks of such a maneuver would be a waves snagging and tearing off a wing, leaving wing debris that might end up floating far away while the rest of the aircraft landed more softly and sank.Peter Marosszeky, a longtime aircraft engineer who advised Boeing on the development of the 777 aircraft and is now the managing director of Aerospace Developments, a Sydney consulting firm, said some wing parts were made from lightweight composite materials that would float easily.If a conscious pilot were still at the controls, it also would have been possible in theory for the plane to glide and travel much farther after it ran out of fuel.But Mr. Dolan said considerable data from the rest of the flight, including signs that the plane maintained its speed, altitude and heading hour after hour as it traveled south across the Indian Ocean, made it very unlikely that a conscious pilot was at the controls."}
{"text": "CAIRO  A political dissident from Bahrain, who was recently released from prison after the government there faced international outrage, said on Saturday that she had fled the country after she was threatened again with detention.The dissident, Zainab al-Khawaja, had been one of the last vocal pro-democracy activists remaining in the country amid a five-year government crackdown on dissent. Since facing an uprising in 2011, Bahrains ruling monarchy has imprisoned prominent activists and opposition leaders or stripped them of citizenship. Other dissidents have either quieted their criticism of the government or left the country.Ms. Khawaja, 32, a dual citizen of Bahrain and Denmark who was imprisoned along with her infant son, was released on humanitarian grounds in May, and left Bahrain for Denmark last week. She said in an interview that Bahraini officials had warned the Danish Embassy that if she did not leave, she would be rearrested within months and separated from her son.I have been arrested 11 times, she said in a telephone interview from Denmark. I have done all I can do inside of prison.The steady disappearance of Bahrains opposition has mirrored the broader repression of political life across the Persian Gulf states after the 2011 revolts, which unnerved the regions monarchs. The rulers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have all taken forceful action against dissidents as part of what some analysts have termed a counterrevolution to quell domestic democratic movements.The monarchies have frequently justified these crackdowns as a reaction to external threats, from either transnational Islamist movements or from hostile states like Iran. The rulers have joined forces, including prosecuting those who criticize friendly gulf nations, or have shared tactics, like revoking opponents citizenship.As the numbers of dissidents in exile grow, they have complained that Western nations with close financial and military ties to the gulf have been reluctant to press for reforms.Bahrain is one of the closest allies of the United States in the Persian Gulf region and hosts the Navys Fifth Fleet. After Ms. Khawaja was detained in March on charges that included ripping a photograph of Bahrains king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, the State Department publicly called for her release.Bahrains government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ms. Khawajas father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, is serving a life sentence in Bahrain for participating in the 2011 uprising. Her sister, Maryam al-Khawaja, a prominent activist, also lives in exile in Denmark."}

{"text": "When Mayte Lara Ibarra, the valedictorian of her high schools graduating class, revealed her plans to attend the University of Texas at Austin on a scholarship, she did what any graduate would do: She shared her excitement on social media.Ms. Lara also declared, proudly, that she is undocumented.Valedictorian, 4.5GPA, full tuition paid for at UT, 13 cords/medals, nice legs, oh and Im undocumented, she wrote in a tweet posted last week, hours after she gave her valedictory speech to fellow graduates at David Crockett High School in Austin.In an era where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, has vowed to build a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants and many Latinos are rushing to seek citizenship to vote against him, others are finding ways to raise their voices or step out of the shadows.Ms. Lara, whose path to the United States was not immediately clear and who didnt mention her undocumented status in her speech, chose instead to talk about AP tests, proms and pep rallies. But on the same day, a few hours north in McKinney, Tex., another valedictorian, Larissa Martinez, did.Speaking to her class, Ms. Martinez, who says shes headed to Yale, declared that she is undocumented, and indirectly addressed anti-immigrant sentiments voiced by Mr. Trump. According to the website Mic, she crossed the border in 2010 from Mexico with her mother and sister.America can be great again without the construction of a wall built on hatred and prejudice, said Ms. Martinez, according to WFAA, a local ABC affiliate. She told the station that she had a full scholarship to Yale with plans to study medicine.But some observers saw the students decision to express pride in being undocumented as an affront, and criticized them on social media.In Ms. Laras case, the outrage over her tweet led her to delete her Twitter account. One critic, Hillary Shay Davis, who has a daughter who graduated with Ms. Lara, said she believed that the teenager was proud of taking advantage of the system.I have never thought about deporting a child who graduated from a U.S. high school and fought against the odds to be successful. Until this moment, Ms. Davis wrote on Facebook. She added, Something else that I have NEVER thought I would support until this moment is Trump and #buildthatwall.Versions of this sentiment echoed throughout social media.Ms. Lara is departing the Austin Independent School District, where 58 percent of students are Hispanic, and entering a college system where Hispanic students are the second-largest share of the population. The University of Texas also offers support services for undocumented students.Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the University of Texas, said that federal law prevented him from discussing the cases of individual students, but he offered a statement that said that the university grants two-semester tuition waivers to all valedictorians of Texas public high schools regardless of their residency status.State law also does not distinguish between documented and undocumented graduates of Texas high schools in admissions and financial aid decisions, the statement said. University policies reflect that law.Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and immigration activist who  revealed that he is undocumented in The New York Times Magazine in 2011, said that gestures like Ms. Laras were part of a larger effort on behalf of undocumented people to be open and upfront about their status.Being undocumented is part of her identity, as is being a Latina, he said Thursday. He added, For many undocumented people, this is our way of telling people that we are not who people think we are.Define American, a project Mr. Vargas started in 2011, holds events and online campaigns where people can share their immigration status, an effort, he said, that was meant to shape the conversation around immigration so its a more human one.Although people have been using Twitter and YouTube to make their immigration status public for years, Mr. Vargas said he thought the criticism of Ms. Martinez and Ms. Lara was coming at a tense time in the election cycle. In the case of Ms. Lara, he said that people were circulating misinformation, and he referred to the state law granting the waivers to valedictorians.This young woman is not taking somebody elses spot, he said of the waivers. Shes not getting special treatment. She is getting that because she graduated as valedictorian, and thats how it is in Texas."}
{"text": "Thursdays cordial get-together between Bernie Sanders and President Obama was a good deal shorter than the eight years that Mr. Sanderss fervent supporters had hoped he would spend in the Oval Office. Still, it said much about the improbable success of a candidacy that had far more impact than anyone predicted when Mr. Sanders, a 74-year-old Vermont socialist with a Brooklyn accent and no big-money backers, launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination with a 10-minute, sparsely attended news conference in the marble glare of the Capitol. There he promised a movement which says we have got to stand together as a people and say that this Capitol, this beautiful Capitol, our country, belongs to all of us and not the billionaire class. If in the end he couldnt succeed without money from the billionaires, he added, hed at least show what a sad state of affairs that is for American democracy.He didnt succeed, but he gave a heavily favored establishment candidate with a long list of impressive credentials  outspoken first lady, United States senator and secretary of state  numerous nervous moments. Unkempt and impatient, often angry, Mr. Sanders projected a shambling charisma that caught the spirit of the time. He divined and channeled the lingering pain of a middle class battered by recession and feeling shut out of a recovery in which Wall Street prospered while factory workers, farmers, students and veterans continued to struggle.He exhorted Americans to use the power of democracy to force change  in contrast to Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, who also promised to elevate the nations disaffected but did it mainly by scapegoating the weak.Mr. Sanders forced Hillary Clinton to pay attention to much of this message. In order to appeal to his followers in the months to come, she will be challenged to generate the same passion, especially among the young, who at rally after rally sat through an hours worth of economic lecturing from a wild-haired man they found to be honest and authentic. It may have been the same lecture over and over again, but die-hard supporters trailed him like fans of the Grateful Dead, attentively listening for occasional improvisations in his shouted assaults on the status quo. On Thursday night, at what may prove to be Mr. Sanderss final rally, some 3,000 people turned up in Washingtons R.F.K. Stadium to cheer his commitment to them.True to his pledge, Mr. Sanders shunned big money, often beating the monthly totals of Mrs. Clinton  much admired by more than a few billionaires  by raking in tens of millions, 27 bucks at a time. In this age of unbridled campaign spending, that alone is a signal achievement, and may it prove a transformative one.In the end, however, Mr. Sanders turned out to be an imperfect messenger. Known in the Senate for his allergy to compromise, and for generating few policy initiatives of consequence, Mr. Sanders offered prescriptions that too often consisted of facile calls for revolution, for feel-good but economically unsustainable proposals for universal health care and free tuition to public colleges. Like Mrs. Clinton, he gave high priority to fighting climate change, but his proposal for ending all hydraulic fracturing for natural gas would have effectively ended the natural gas boom that has done much to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming.And however acute his diagnosis of the 2008 recession, he never fully explained how he would hold Wall Street more accountable for the practices that sank so many homeowners during the recession. These shortcomings were most glaring in the primary campaign in New York, where Mrs. Clintons command of policy minutiae helped give her a pivotal win.After D.C.s lonely final primary on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders is likely to end his quest for the nomination  but not for what he calls the revolution. Mr. Sanders will seek to merge his message with that of the Democratic Party platform. Along with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who endorsed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday with a powerful attack on Mr. Trump, he remains a forceful and credible voice against the demagogy of a supposed billionaire. He is a politician focused firmly on the needs of everyday Americans who can now count among his achievements an honorable campaign that prodded Democrats to attention."}

He noted that promoters regularly sell their tickets on the secondary market to hide their identities while jacking up ticket prices.To add transparency, we have proposed legislation to force venues and artists to publicly disclose the total number of tickets available, as well as those not available to the general public. Venues and artists have always resisted. Why? Simply because if consumers knew the truth, they would no longer be fans.We support making it illegal for venues not to reveal the exact number of tickets available to the general public. This introduction of transparency would refocus the spotlight on the true culprits, as well as provide valuable information the venues and artists may not want fans to know.DON VACCAROChief Executive, TicketNetworkNew York"}
{"text": "A tenuous peace in the upper echelons of the Republican Party showed signs of unraveling this weekend as a major donor compared Donald J. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini, Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney reignited their feud, and one of Mr. Trumps aides took a shot at an important campaign ally.Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a major contributor to Republican candidates, railed against Mr. Trump on Friday at a closed-door meeting of Republicans in Park City, Utah, comparing him to the Axis leaders, according to several people in attendance who declined to be identified because the discussion was private.The comments, first reported by The Washington Post, came at Mr. Romneys annual retreat of Republican donors, leaders and business executives. Mr. Trumps candidacy, and the divisions it is causing among leading Republicans, was an undercurrent of the gathering. Mr. Romney has been outspoken in his refusal to support Mr. Trump, the partys presumptive presidential nominee, even as other party figures have grudgingly fallen into line.No one has personified the partys divisions like Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, and the pressure on him intensified this weekend. At the Utah retreat on Friday, Campbell Brown, a former CNN anchor, pressed Mr. Ryan on his decision to support Mr. Trump, according to an attendee, saying she did not know how to explain it to her children.Then, on Saturday, Dan Scavino Jr., a senior adviser and the social media director for the Trump campaign, criticized Mr. Ryan on Twitter, linking to an article on a conservative website that accused him of harming his party, complete with the headline Paul Ryan Is the Reason the G.O.P. Is Losing America.The discord appeared to bring a quick end to a period of relative peace in the party that began Tuesday when Mr. Trump issued a statement in which he backed away, slightly, from remarks accusing a federal judge of being biased against him because of the judges Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump did not apologize but said his remarks had been misconstrued.Later that night, after the final primaries of the presidential race, he gave a restrained speech in which he refrained from offending anyone.The new approach did not last long. By the end of the week, he had resumed referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has called Mr. Trump a racist bully, as Pocahontas because of her claims during her Senate bid that she had Native American heritage, which has not been proved.Somebody said to me, one of the media, Mr. Trump, would you apologize? Mr. Trump said at a rally on Saturday in Tampa, Fla. I said, Yes, Ill apologize  to Pocahontas, I will apologize! Because Pocahontas is insulted.Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Romney, calling him a choker and saying he didnt work like he should have worked when he was the nominee in 2012. Once Mr. Romney lost, Mr. Trump added, he should have gone off into the sunset.You dont sit there jealous and sick to your stomach, he said.A day earlier, Mr. Romney, in an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer, said he feared that Mr. Trumps election would lead to trickle-down racism that would change the character of the generations of Americans that are following.Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, gently chided Mr. Romney on Twitter on Friday, writing, Respect Mitt and differences but couldnt disagree more.Adding that the Supreme Court was too important to lose for generations, Mr. Priebus ended his post, Lets stop this and unify.Mr. Trump and the party have gotten a late start on fund-raising for the general election and need as many of the partys reliable donors as they can attract. At Mr. Romneys donor retreat on Saturday, Mr. Priebus was more pointed, telling donors opposed to Mr. Trump that the party would win with or without you, according to an attendee present for his remarks.A representative for Ms. Whitman did not respond Saturday to a request for an interview about her comments. Ms. Whitman, according to one of the people present, did not stop at comparing Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. She also warned the gathering that if Republicans compromised on their principles to win an important election, they would be entering fraught territory.What happens next time? she asked, implying that it could lead to more compromises and more candidates like Mr. Trump.Ms. Whitman, who ran for governor of California in 2010 and was a finance co-chairwoman for Mr. Romney in 2012, was part of a group of major donors who tried to stop Mr. Trump during the primaries through paid advertising. She has been explicit about her disdain for him.Look at the comments hes made about women, about Muslims, about reporters, she told CNBC in March. Its just repugnant.The group at the retreat represented a mix of the Republican Party, divided between those who have said they cannot support Mr. Trump, like Mr. Romney, and those who have tepidly endorsed him, like Mr. Ryan, who was Mr. Romneys running mate in 2012.In an emailed statement, Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Whitmans comments. I never met Meg Whitman, but the job she is doing at Hewlett Packard is not a very good one, Mr. Trump said. Based on the disastrous campaign she ran in California, and the tens of millions of dollars she wasted, I have learned a lot from her. I do not want her support.Mr. Trumps campaign did not respond to questions about its social media directors gibe at Mr. Ryan, which at a minimum showed a lack of message discipline inside the campaign. Whether it would endanger Mr. Ryans support of Mr. Trump was not clear; the speakers office did not respond to requests for comment Saturday.He was forced to respond Friday when pressed by Ms. Brown, who now runs an education website and is married to Dan Senor, who was an adviser to Mr. Ryan and to one of Mr. Trumps primary race rivals, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Turning to Mr. Ryan during a panel discussion, Ms. Brown told him that one morning, one of her sons, expressing disappointment, had asked why he endorsed Mr. Trump.What, she asked Mr. Ryan, was she supposed to tell her child?The attendee present for the exchange said Mr. Ryan appeared slightly uncomfortable but handled the question well. He said Mr. Ryan had explained that while he understood the disagreement among Republicans, he believed that his decision to support Mr. Trump would be better for the Republican Party in the long term.Mr. Trump, he said, had won with large margins in some of his House members districts, and many voters liked and supported the candidate.Indeed, Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination with the same flamethrowing approach he is using today.Its like what they said about his temper, said Brett Mohnkern, 29, of Oil City, Pa., who went to Mr. Trumps rally on Saturday in Pittsburgh. Tone down for what?Still, the attendee who saw the exchange with Mr. Ryan on Friday said the partys debate over whether to support Mr. Trump was like a familys struggle with a divorce.Mr. Ryan, in one of his appearances at the retreat, tried to infuse what little humor he could into the situation. He joked that he had recently told David Copperfield that he wished the magician could make Mr. Ryan disappear from 2016."}
{"text": "ST.-DENIS, France  The barricades went up early. Metal fences, police officers directing traffic, military personnel with guns slung over their shoulders. It was hard to move around the Stade de France on Friday, and this was by design.In packs and throngs, people still shuffled toward this huge stadium on the outskirts of Paris. From the Metro station. From the cafes. From the caged-in basketball court a few blocks away, one game ending a few hours before another, in a different sport, began.The fans, many in the yellow of Romania but most in the blue of France, smiled and laughed. Some took selfies with other spectators or even law enforcement officers. A young boy tried on a gendarmes hat.Eighteen years to the day since France opened the 1998 World Cup here (and went on to win it), six years since France was awarded this tournament and about seven months since suicide bombers and gunmen murdered 130 people  including one just outside this stadium  during a chilling night of terror, the European Championships are, finally, open.The first game was everything the French could have wanted, a 2-1 victory over Romania that featured a beautiful, powerful, majestic shot from Dimitri Payet in the 89th minute that rippled the top corner of the net and settled everyones nerves. With an expanded field of 24 teams competing for the first time and only eight set to be eliminated during the group stage, little lasting damage would have been done to Frances title hopes with a tie, but victory fit the script far better.It was emotional  from a psychological perspective, it was, in no way, easy to manage, Didier Deschamps, the France manager, said afterward. But we were rewarded.It is a strange time here. Strikes involving transit workers, airline pilots and gas company employees, among others, have crippled the gears of Frances infrastructure. Intense rain recently caused the Seine to rise over its banks, flooding parts of the city and forcing relocations that included some of the most valuable pieces of art in the Louvre and Orsay museums, which were shifted to higher floors to ensure their safety.For the past few weeks, a sense of fraying has lingered over France, particularly in Paris. Delays and cancellations on buses, trains and subways have become common, even as demand has swollen because of the influx of foreign visitors. Garbage has piled up on the streets. Water damage is ubiquitous. Until recently, lines at gas stations routinely stretched for blocks.All of that was fueled even more by a wariness regarding the possibility of a terrorist attack during this tournament. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks last winter and has said the Euros are a target. Many countries, including the United States, have issued travel warnings for citizens headed to France during this period; some players have expressed concerns about the safety of their families.At least one, the German defender Jrme Boateng, decided to leave his children at home because the risk is simply too big for me, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild.French officials have vowed to do everything possible to secure the tournament, with upward of 100,000 people devoted to the job. Spectators coming to the match on Friday found a multilayered perimeter around the stadium, with phalanxes of armed guards augmented by bomb-sniffing dogs as well as undercover officers moving among the crowds.Some groups mixed sports and politics, chanting that France is a police state  it has been under a state of emergency since the November attacks and will remain so throughout this tournament  or voicing protests against an unpopular labor law. Others simply milled around in the official fan zone, enjoying the significance of the evening (and the smell of sausages) even as the security presence loomed.One might say its going to damper the atmosphere, said Pierre-Yves Cerel, a 28-year-old Parisian. But theres a feeling of security. I talked to many friends to see whether it was safe to come here tonight.In the end, he did come, as did about 75,000 other fans. And what they saw was a stirring opening ceremony that concluded with a loud, lively, emotional version of the French national anthem. They saw a stunted start in which Romania nearly scored in the first few moments  the French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a stunning save on a shot from close range  and a nervy performance from the hosts in the first half.They saw NGolo Kant, a midfielder, running everywhere. They saw Antoine Griezmann, a forward, frustrated by missed opportunities. They saw Olivier Giroud, another striker, make up for his own wasted chances by heading France into the lead just before the hour. And they saw Romania draw level on a penalty kick  Bogdan Stancu converting after an ill-advised foul by Patrice Evra  about seven minutes later.And then, gloriously, they saw Payet  who might have been the man of the match anyway, with his slick play and his assist on Girouds goal  send a rippling blast from about 20 yards that stopped rising only when it smacked into the goals taut netting.A year ago, Payet, who plays for West Ham in the English league, was not even a certainty to be on the French team for this tournament. On Friday, he produced the teams biggest win since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.If someone had told me it would have gone like this, Payet said, I wouldnt have believed it.Minutes later, Payet was substituted. As he ran off the field, a long, loud ovation washed over him and, just for a second, he looked around to take in the scene. The fans shouted. The stands shook. Payet stared, his eyes wide and warm and wet.It had been an emotional night. For everyone."}
{"text": "Jonathan Roper, once a sales manager at Insys Therapeutics, a small pharmaceutical company, had a problem. The end of the quarter was near, and for the first time, Insys was in danger of missing sales goals for its only product, a spray called Subsys that contains the powerful painkiller fentanyl.So Mr. Roper sent out a blistering email to his staff members at the time, in March 2014, urging them to make a final push. There is no excuse for any of your docs to not take care of you at this crucial time of the quarter, he wrote. Its time, he said, for the top-prescribing doctors to give back for all of the hard work, long days and late nights you have spoiled them with.Mr. Roper and a former sales representative, Fernando Serrano, were arrested on Thursday on federal anti-kickback charges, accused of paying thousands of dollars to doctors to participate in what federal prosecutors described as sham educational programs in exchange for prescribing millions of dollars worth of fentanyl. Criminal charges against drug company employees are unusual, legal experts said, underscoring the sordid nature of the case and its connection with fentanyl, which is frequently abused and can lead to deadly overdoses if inappropriately prescribed.The federal indictment, which quotes Mr. Ropers emails, does not mention Insys by name. But other details in the document  including when the drug was approved and its annual sales in 2015  make it clear that Insys, based in Arizona, is the company in question. Insys has previously disclosed that it is under federal investigation for its sales and marketing practices. Last year, a nurse pleaded guilty to federal charges of accepting kickbacks from the company.Federal prosecutors say that the case is particularly egregious because it involves inappropriate marketing of fentanyl, a drug that is 100 times more potent than morphine and abuse of which has been skyrocketing in the United States. Fentanyl is the drug that the musician Prince accidentally overdosed on, killing him, although it is not clear what form he took. Fentanyl is a generic drug and is sold in many forms. The version sold by Insys is for cancer patients.Fentanyl is an incredibly dangerous and highly addictive drug that is finding its way into, and destroying, too many lives in our communities, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. As alleged, Roper and Serrano helped feed this devastating surge of opioid addictions by tapping into another age-old addiction, greed.A spokeswoman for Insys, Lisa Wilson, says the company holds its employees to standards that require they comply with the law. Insys is committed to working with health care providers, patients and other stakeholders in the health care community to help ensure the proper prescribing and use of our product, she said.A lawyer for Mr. Roper, 37, of Commack, N.Y., declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Serrano, 30, of Manalapan, N.J., did not return a call. It is unclear why the two employees left the company.In the indictment, filed in the Southern District in Manhattan, prosecutors said that doctors were paid as much as $3,000 per speaking engagement and that the events were held in fancy restaurants. Rather than inviting doctors who were new to using the product, the guests were often friends of the speakers, or were doctors who had already attended similar events and were unlikely to learn anything new. Sign-in sheets contained signatures that were forged to make the events look legitimate, the prosecutors said.After the dinners, the doctors and sales representatives sometimes left for a strip club, where the doctors were not asked to pay a cover charge or for their drinks. Instead, they were entertained at a reserved table with bottles of liquor, according to the indictments.But all of this attention did not come free, prosecutors argued: Mr. Roper and Mr. Serrano expected that the doctors would return the favor by prescribing more Subsys.One top speaker, according to Mr. Ropers indictment, was paid $147,245 in speaking fees in 2014 and accounted for about $1.2 million in prescriptions of Subsys that were reimbursed through Medicare. Another doctor singled out in the complaint was paid $112,340 in speaking fees in 2014 and prescribed $1.4 million worth of Subsys that was paid for by Medicare, according to the indictment. The doctors were not named in the indictment.Approved in 2012, Subsys is a form of fentanyl that is sprayed under the tongue and is approved for use only in patients who have cancer and experience pain even though they are already on round-the-clock painkillers. Fentanyl can be deadly if it is prescribed in large doses to someone who has not already become tolerant to opioids.Despite the drugs tight restrictions, sales of Subsys have been strong, taking in $330 million in 2015. Although Insys was an early favorite with Wall Street, it has struggled as it has faced questions about its marketing practices. Its stock is down more than 50 percent in the last year, and fell more than 12 percent on Friday alone.In 2014, an analysis by the research firm Symphony Health found that just 1 percent of prescriptions for Subsys were from oncologists, those who would be most likely to treat cancer patients. Doctors who prescribe Subsys must take a test that proves they understand the drugs risks. But according to the indictment on Thursday, Mr. Roper gave a doctor answers to the test questions.Drug companies have paid billions of dollars in fines in recent years to settle allegations that they improperly marketed their drugs. This case has unfolded in an unusual way: prosecutors pursuing criminal charges against various people.In 2014, a Michigan neurologist was arrested after federal prosecutors said he defrauded Medicare of $7 million and improperly prescribed Subsys. Last year, a nurse at a Connecticut pain clinic who pleaded guilty for receiving $83,000 in kickbacks from Insys acknowledged that the money influenced the prescribing of the drug. The nurse, who was authorized to prescribe medication, was responsible for more than $1 million in Medicare claims and was the highest prescriber of Subsys in Connecticut.Were not talking about acne cream here, said Patrick Burns, the executive director of Taxpayers Against Fraud, an advocacy group for whistle-blowers. Were talking about one of the most addictive substances known to man, that puts people in a box on a daily basis.He predicted that further action against Insys was likely. I suspect that they are zeroing in on their scope in order to go for a larger corporate hunt, he said."}
{"text": "The Anti-Defamation League added a new symbol this week to Hate on Display, its database of prominent white supremacist imagery. Its called the echo, and it is used online to call attention to Jewish names in the news.The symbol originated in 2014 on an anti-Semitic podcast, The Daily Shoah, which applied a novelty sound effect to Jewish names that made them echo ominously.That practice then spread to blogs and Twitter, where the podcasts creators and fans created a visual translation of the echo sound effect by placing three sets of parentheses around a Jewish name, like (((Cohen))) or (((Goldberg))). The parentheses later turned up in a Chrome browser extension called Coincidence Detector, which found Jewish names in text and automatically trapped them in the echo. (Google has since banned the extension from the Chrome store.) Enterprising white nationalists are now printing the echo on T-shirts.This is how a hate symbol rises in 2016: A podcast sound effect becomes a Twitter meme and a browser extension before it finally slithers into the physical world.The echo is the first officially recognized symbol to emerge from the alt-right, a movement of white-and-proud extremists who are as obsessed with cultural memes as they are with white nationalism. They play fast and loose with white supremacist iconography, remixing it with pop culture and the sardonic tone of internet subculture. Their regressive message, cloaked in an ultramodern skin, is being spread online to a new generation of race warriors.Theres now an unlimited number of white supremacist memes, just like theres an unlimited number of cat memes, said Mark Pitcavage, an expert on right-wing extremism who also maintains the Anti-Defamation Leagues hate-symbol database. Theyll take all sorts of pop culture memes and white-supremacize them.Modern white supremacist memes recast unwilling recruits. With the help of digital photo editing, Guy Fieri becomes a Nazi soldier, and Taylor Swift turns into their Aryan Goddess. (Ms. Swifts lawyers recently shot off a letter to an alt-right blog asking it to cease and desist associating her image with anti-Semitic rhetoric.) The most recent episode of The Daily Shoah podcast (itself a twist on The Daily Show) kicks off with an anti-Semitic parody of Poisons ballad Every Rose Has Its Thorn. Even a Twitter ad for DiGiorno pizza (Do you ever find yourself just staring into the oven?) can be reframed into a reference to the Holocaust, just by being retweeted by an alt-right account.It shouldnt surprise us that bigots are early adopters of technology, said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. Their noxious views are difficult to circulate openly. But on social media, they can post something to Twitter or Facebook and achieve exponential reach under a cloak of anonymity.Old-school bigots have been recycling offensive images electronically for decades. The white supremacist movement is very visually and symbolically oriented, Mr. Pitcavage said. Once symbols are established, they dont tend to die.He has watched racists translate Klan codes into email addresses and spread Nazi insignia on message boards since the 1980s. As each new element of the internet emerged, white supremacists were right there with it, Mr. Pitcavage said.The echo symbol is emblematic of a new class of bigotry born and bred online. Anti-Racist Is Code for Anti-White, a slogan that was lifted from an early-2000s pro-segregationist tract called The Mantra, has proliferated online as a piece of white supremacist copypasta  text thats obsessively copied and pasted across internet forums. The mathematical sign for not equal has been repurposed as a statement against racial equality. Like the echo, it leverages the computer keyboard to create the new supremacist symbolism for the modern era.The Anti-Defamation League has called the alt-right the new white supremacy, and its figures poke fun at their grandfathers displays of white pride even as they create their own. The hosts of The Daily Shoah performatively pronounce white as huh-white, a mocking imitation of a good ol boy. The podcasts echo winks at the cheesy sound effects favored by old-school right-wing radio shock jocks.Much of the alt-rights language and imagery is borrowed from 4chan, an anonymous, ephemeral message board that revels in politically incorrect jokes and nihilistic posturing. The roiling discussion on 4chan tends to represent a libertarian, white, male perspective, said Ryan Milner, a communications professor at the College of Charleston who studies online groups. Its humor plays with outright stereotypes that veer into white supremacy.Both the alt-right and 4chan share favorite insults, like cucks (feminized men) and normies (the unsophisticated masses) and work from the same meme palette, dealing out pop cultural barrel-scrapes that perpetuate racist and anti-Semitic tropes. Pepe the Frog, a favorite cartoon character on 4chan that has since become a mainstream teenage idol on Tumblr, has emerged as an unofficial alt-right mascot. Its just that on alt-right accounts, Pepe appears with an exaggerated hook nose or comes adorned with a Trumpian toupee.The alt-right takes the online subcultures discourse and dials it up to the level of political agitation. The Southern Poverty Law Center has charted fervent support for Donald J. Trump among right-wing extremists, who share exultant memes celebrating Trumps ascension. In April, the center reported that some of Mr. Trumps rhetoric can drive mainstream attention to racist memes.Take it from the alt-right bloggers themselves. The movement is winning the meme war, an alt-right blogger calling himself Lawrence Murray wrote last month.Jewish public figures are fighting back. On Twitter, Jewish writers have reclaimed the echo, adding parentheses around their Twitter handles in a show of defiance. In turn, white nationalists like Lana Lokteff have flipped the symbol to signal their non-Jewish heritage: )))Lana Lokteff(((.Out of the depths of online culture, new hate speech rises: Cuckservative, a portmanteau of cuckold and conservative (its a long story) has now been acknowledged by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a racist slur.But at the same time, the sardonic sheen that coats everything oozing from internet subcultures helps provide cover for white supremacists. True bigotry is often excused as nothing more than crude humor or nihilistic trolling. The echo symbol started as a joke among us, a host of The Daily Shoah said on the podcast this week. He chided the news media for taking it too seriously.To them, its humor. To everyone else, its hate. In online collective communication, you dont always have a lot of context to understand the motivations behind a message, Mr. Milner said. Is this earnest? Is this serious? Does it even matter?Online, white supremacists spread their message not through crosses burned on front lawns, but through little bits of conversation shared on Twitter, Mr. Milner said, that then spread to classrooms and bars and living rooms. Who cares if the Klansman is smirking beneath his hood?"}

{"text": "Islay, Scotland  DAWN is yet to arrive and I am standing at the edge of my mornings work: a small, succulent meadow. It is late spring in Islay, a remote island famous for its whisky in the Inner Hebrides, a three-hour ferry crossing from mainland Scotland.Thanks to the mild Atlantic climate, the grass is lush, not full-summer lush yet, but with that early flush of spring and long enough to cut. As the scale of farm machinery has outgrown this small field, which is no bigger than two tennis courts, it is no long possible for a tractor to get in.In a short while, the sun will be up. So I take out my stone and dress the blade of my scythe to prepare for the first cut. By mid-morning, the dew will be gone, and the long grass will lie down in front of the blade and be harder to cut cleanly.I do it as we have always done here, cutting a swath in a spiral from the outer edge to the center. The idea of cutting in this way is to allow the corncrakes and other ground-nesting birds time to escape to the margins. These small bantam-like birds are a migratory species threatened by loss of habitat, thanks mainly to intensive agriculture.And so I cut, moving my hips in rhythm to the arc of the scythes swing, shuffling forward bit by bit, nibbling away at the foot-long grass and depositing it on my left. I concentrate on keeping the blade in touch with the ground. Its a dance of sorts. The dance of the mower and the grass.Tolstoy understood the satisfactions of this work. In Anna Karenina, Levin joins the peasants to harvest the hay on his estate. His brother scoffs, but Levin is soon absorbed in his labors:The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe, but the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work turned out regular and well finished of itself. These were the most blissful moments.Working slowly and deliberately, with little noise, allows me to be part of nature, rather than striving against it. Every 20 to 30 cuts, I stop to resharpen, taking my straik, or stone, from its copper holster where it has been sitting in water and quickly hone the blade. It makes a light rasping noise, and sometimes a little ring, that contrasts with the swish of the scythe through the damp grass.After a good hour, I stop. I am warm and happy to be in the swing while its still early and the morning air is cool.This hay will be hard won. The windrow, or cut grass, will be turned over several days, allowing the soft grass to become dried hay. Once its dry enough, I will rake it into the small mounds called haycocks. There is no need for me to make a stack, for well take the hay straight to a small open barn for storage.The scythe binds you to the landscape. You become part of it, in the picture. Looking across a mown meadow, you have the deep satisfaction of knowing that this was your handiwork.The scythe I use  a snath, as the ashwood handle is called, affixed to a hand-forged steel blade  is as ancient in design as the system of mowing I follow. Probably an evolution of the handheld sickle, the scythe appears in Roman literature, and its use became widespread in Europe in the eighth century. Still used today in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, the scythe is making a modest comeback elsewhere, too.There is a small but growing band of scythers in Britain. The Scythe Association of Britain and Ireland has about 170 active members who meet regularly. A few traditional landworkers, like me, use the scythe for mowing small plots. A larger group uses them as quiet, nonpolluting, human-powered tools for managing their gardens and recreational areas. A scythe will pay its way quickly, efficiently and ethically  as well as giving you a nice workout.Scything also has a dedicated band of adherents in the United States. One is Alfonso Diaz, who first learned to swing a scythe in the Asturias region of northern Spain but now lives in Washington, D.C.I have seen increased interest in scything here, he said, in urban areas like D.C. and New York, as well as in the Midwest.About 70 people of all ages attended a recent demonstration he gave at a country festival. He also gives classes in urban gardens  where scything just makes more sense; the spaces are too small for a mower  and hes seen an upsurge of interest from a new generation.Obviously, they are not cutting acres of hay on farms, he noted, but they are trying to be more environmentally conscious.The petrol-driven weed whacker I could be using instead of my scythe is noisy, smelly and costly. In competitions, the weed whacker regularly loses to a smooth, efficient scyther. I like being able to mow my meadow without needing ear and eye protection. I like clearing areas without any pollution, be it noise, fumes or fragments of plastic wire left all over the place.The small parcel of land I am mowing comes with the woodland I rent from a nearby estate. I scythe not just to save money, but for the immense pleasure of keeping up a tradition. I also love the meditative action itself.The Scythe, a poem from a 1937 collection by the aptly named Stanley Snaith, who was born in Kendal, Cumbria, and was a librarian in Bethnal Green, London, put it this way:Although I was dimly aware of these skills when growing up, it was not until 1986 that I realized that the old country ways were fast disappearing. I was working as an actor on the set of Comrades, a film about the Tolpuddle Martyrs (a group of agricultural workers in 1830s England who tried to form a labor union and were transported in chains to Australia for their pains), when an old fella came to teach us scything.He was the last professional scyther in the county of Dorset, his job being to manage the railway cut between Dorchester and Weymouth. It was a magical moment, and so I set out to learn this and other ancient skills like dry-stone walling and hedge-laying.By a strange symmetry, years later I found myself scything on a film set once again  this time, with a group of peasant extras in Joe Wrights 2012 adaptation of Anna Karenina. We spent three days mowing on Salisbury Plain, west of London.We worked, ate, drank and camped together, just like the old days when groups of mowers followed the season, cutting northward. We, too, became a band and mowed as one.Our days of labor ended mostly on the cutting-room floor. Only 15 seconds of our mowing made the final cut. I wasnt even in a frame. But if you listen carefully, that swish you hear is my blade, going through the grass."}
{"text": "The New York artist Louise Fishman was on the front lines of the early feminist movement of the 1960s, and out in the streets for gay liberation. She was also hard at work in the studio, as she has been for 50 years. Now, at 77, shes having her first full-dress retrospective, at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, N.Y., through July.Ms. Fishman started small, with fabric pieces and gridded drawings. In the 1970s, these exploded into the slashing Angry Paintings based on the names of female artists, including her own. She then translated that energy into pure abstraction, which has become richer and more expansive, turning somber after a visit to Auschwitz in the 1980s, and oceanic, after her immersion in the work of J.M.W. Turner. The Neuberger show includes an exhibition of sketchbooks and miniature sculptures at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia (through Aug. 14). (The retrospective is at Purchase College, neuberger.org; Paper Louise Tiny Fishman Rock, at icaphila.org.)"}
{"text": "Andrew Beal, a billionaire banker and investor, called me the other day to talk Trump. I had been leaving messages for every prominent business executive I could find who has publicly expressed support of the Republican candidate.Before I could ask my first question, Beal told me he wanted to get something out of the way. He knew that I would ask about specifics. Everybody wants to be real specific, he said. But Beals support for Trump has nothing to do with specifics. He grants that he doesnt know much about Trumps policy goals or about whom he might choose for key economic positions. He doesnt even think Trump knows. And that, he explained, is exactly why he supports him. All these politicians with all these specific plans, he said. I think its total [expletive].His point was that business doesnt run this way: If youre hiring someone to be a chief executive, you dont ask them to lay out every decision theyll make, years ahead of when theyll make it. You hire someone whom you trust, and you let them run things. Beal says he knows that Trump will do the right things to make the economy perform better. Youre going to say, How? he told me. I dont know how. I know that sounds crazy. Thats how the real world operates.Now that Trump has sewn up the nomination, a looming question is whether he can consolidate the support of business people behind him. During the last election cycle, Mitt Romneys business background was a major reason he became the candidate of choice for corporate America; he received huge donations from nearly every major bank, many business-advocacy groups and countless chief executives. But at least so far, such eminences have failed to rally around Trump. The only large corporate donor named in his federal election filings is Aon, the insurance giant; when I called its public-relations office, a seemingly exasperated spokeswoman wanted to make very clear that one employee had given that money and that it did not reflect the views of the company.Earlier this month, The Times reported that Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, had planned a fund-raiser for Trump, but the event was mysteriously canceled. Aside from a handful of real-estate developers and investors who have done business with Trump, vocal support from the nations corporate elite has been up until now an unusual occurrence. (One rare exception is Peter Thiel, the PayPal billionaire and Gawker persecutor, who backs Trump and has signed on as one of his delegates from California.) Ive also found next to no support for Trump among economists and business-school professors, a group that included a large contingent of Romney supporters in 2012. Among academic economists, I could find only one: Peter Navarro of the University of California, Irvine, a longtime critic of Chinese trade practices who says he is drawn to Trumps aggressive stance on trade negotiations.I asked Trumps campaign for a list of prominent businesspeople and chief executives who have endorsed him. I was emailed a quote from Trump. I have too many to mention, it read. I get along with everybody. After further prodding, a campaign spokeswoman provided a list of 10 names, including the chief executives of Nascar and Marvel, as well as several other businesspeople, like Rupert Murdoch and Jack Welch, who opposed Trump for most of the campaign but have recently (and not especially enthusiastically) made statements about party unity.When I talked to some of the few businesspeople who do support Trump, the common refrain was the one I heard from Andrew Beal: that the specifics of his plans were beside the point, because Trumps proven instincts as a businessman were all that mattered. Phil Ruffin, a Las Vegas billionaire, said: I cant tell you his policies. Youre asking me questions I cant answer. I dont think hes fully developed all the policies he has to develop. The details of which will probably come later. Stephen Stepanek  a New Hampshire state representative and a founder of a company called Hampshire Paper  told me much the same thing. One of his strengths, as far as I see it: Donald Trump has the unique ability to look at a problem, identify that problem and surround himself with the best possible minds and solve that problem, he said.Does he? By many accounts, Mitt Romney did. Romney was an undeniable superstar in the field of private equity, and former business associates praised him as someone who could see a business problem more clearly than others and create powerful, profitable solutions. The professional biography of Trump, by contrast  though the man is clearly exceptional at something  hardly inspires such confidence.Trumps primary claim to fame is as a Manhattan real-estate developer. He inherited this profession (and his economic worldview) from his father. But its worth stressing that within the world of Manhattan real estate, Trump is a relatively minor player. Yes, there are about a dozen buildings in New York City that bear his name, but nearly all are branding relationships, not actual ownership. He sits so far down the pecking order of Manhattan real estate that Adam Pincus, head of research at the industry publication The Real Deal, doesnt recall ever including Trump or his companies in their major rankings of developers, owners or property managers. Likewise, Trumps importance in the industry of casinos and luxury resorts is far below what his public reputation might suggest. After multiple bankruptcies, Trump no longer owns any casinos; he owns only nine hotels, with three more said to be coming soon.Through Trump Productions, he has enjoyed remarkable success with his TV show The Apprentice. But of course, that series does not fundamentally belong to him: It was created by Mark Burnett, who cast Trump in the lead. And while Trumps television franchise at least enjoyed one successful idea before petering out, most of his brand-specific businesses have simply failed outright. The frenetic, panicky way in which he thrusts his name on different products pell-mell  steaks and ties and wine and bottled water and suits and fragrance  has engendered what any corporate branding expert would call brand confusion. (What are you communicating when you wear a Trump-branded suit  $143 on Amazon  to a job interview? That you are brash and ambitious? Cocky on the cheap? Or that you dont know much about suits?)His scattershot approach to branding might also hint at cash-flow issues. As a certified billionaire, Mark Cuban recently said in a radio interview: When youre putting your name on steaks, youre putting your name on water, youre putting your name on playing cards, youre putting your name on all this nonsense, right, youre not going to make big bucks, no matter what. He recalls asking Trump: What the hell are you doing? Are you that desperate for money? Based on his read of Trumps election filings, which showed only $165 million in liquid assets, Cuban harbors doubts about whether Trump is even a billionaire as he claims.Recent revelations about Trump University, the failed for-profit college that Trump founded in 2005, have centered around the savagely cynical manner in which sales reps separated students from their money, with an array of high-pressure tactics that included encouraging financially challenged prospects to open up new credit-card accounts in order to pay. But the more striking question is Cubans: why a man with as much money as Trump claims to have, presiding over as many successful ventures as Trump claims to own, would stoop to start up a boiler-room business like Trump University, squeezing out revenues from would-be students a few thousand dollars at a time. The fact that he did  even if that decision doesnt point, as Cuban suggests, to an outright desperation for cash  speaks volumes about Trumps utter inability to calibrate risk and reward.When you try to weigh Trumps record as a businessman, you quickly find that theres nothing of substance. Think of the characteristics you might find noteworthy in a business leader: A vision of the future? A single-minded focus on excellence? Discrimination and judgment? Hes no visionary, no Steve Jobs who forges new things. Trumps accomplishments have come from replicating the products and services of others. He seems to lack any instinct for righting a sinking ship. Despite the declarations of his backers that hell get the best people, his organizations have hardly been magnets for talent  as evidenced by the fact that his leadership teams so often consist of people whose last names are Trump or whose sole accomplishment is having worked for him.Despite all this, Trump receives extremely high marks among voters for how he would supposedly handle the economy: A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll in May found he outpolled Clinton by 11 points on the issue. The biggest mystery is why so many voters  apparently including, at least for now, some who plan to vote for Hillary Clinton  seem to have fallen for his act. Perhaps its simply the fact that in the absence of real information about Trump the businessman, Americans have spent years watching him play the part. His true calling seems to be acting like a successful businessman  a performance made all the more impressive by its distance from reality."}

{"text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.  The leading scorer in the N.H.L. playoffs offered a simple reason he was able to contribute with a goal and two assists when the San Jose Sharks staved off elimination Thursday in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals.I just dont want to go home, dont want the season to end, forward Logan Couture, who has a league-best 29 points in 23 postseason games, said Saturday as the Sharks prepared for Sundays Game 6 against the Pittsburgh Penguins.Couture, 27, is well aware that despite San Joses 4-2 victory in Game 5, the Penguins remain in control of the series and are one victory from making the Sharks first trip to the Stanley Cup finals a futile one. But the emergency medical situation Couture went through this season might help him keep even that in perspective.Couture had to leave a Dec. 9 game at Edmonton after absorbing a hit in the second period. But it was not until the plane ride back to San Jose that he realized how serious the injury was.We flew back home, and my leg just kept swelling bigger and bigger, Couture said of what was later determined to be internal arterial bleeding. My leg was just continuously filling with blood, and it could have gotten to the point where you dont know whats going to happen, if youre going to lose your leg or die.Couture, who left the plane in a wheelchair, said: It was scary. You never know. I was in the hospital, and I got an M.R.I., and I came out, and there was eight or 10 doctors staring at my M.R.I., so I knew something was serious. The doctor came and talked to me, and it was tough. He assured me everything was going to be O.K., but you never know.Only after he had had surgery did Couture stop worrying. It was probably as bad as its been in my life thinking about something like that, he said.Couture missed seven games, having already missed 30 because of a broken leg he sustained on Oct. 15 when his skate hit a rut during a morning practice in New Jersey. The injuries were unrelated, although both were to his right leg.Couture turned out to be the catalyst for San Joses turnaround. Without him in the lineup, the Sharks were 14-15-1 in the regular season. With him, they were 32-15-5.On Saturday, Coach Peter DeBoer found a silver lining to the loss of Couture for those 30 games.I think it was a blessing in disguise, looking back at it now, because it forced me to get to know the organization top to bottom, said DeBoer, who is in his first year with San Jose. It was a quick learn for me on the depth of the organization. Got to know the young guys, know what they could do, what they couldnt do.When Couture did return, DeBoer added, he was fresh. The team had a better sense of itself, and the organization was better able to identify what deadline trades might help.Couture said he was not sure whether missing time this season was helping him now. But his 29 points in the playoffs  six more than his teammates Joe Pavelski and Brent Burns have collected, and seven more than Phil Kessel, the highest-scoring Penguin  indicate the time off has not hurt.Couture did not dispute the suggestion that he was playing his best hockey since San Jose took him ninth over all in the 2007 draft.I feel pretty good, said Couture, who finished the regular season with 15 goals and 21 assists in 52 games. Things are going offensively, and were at this point.In Game 5, he scored a deflection goal when he got the blade of his stick on a shot from defenseman Justin Braun, and he made a no-look, between-the-legs backhand pass to wing Melker Karlsson for what proved to be the game winner. Couture ended up with his fourth three-point performance of the postseason, with each coming in an elimination game.DeBoer recognized Coutures importance at the beginning of the season, though, naming him an alternate captain.I think he definitely has embraced it, DeBoer said. I think hes earned it."}
{"text": "A firearm that the authorities said was used on Sunday in a mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., is a descendant of one of the worlds most widely distributed and familiar infantry weapons, and a type of rifle that has been involved in previous mass shootings in the United States.Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said the gunmans weapons included a handgun and an AR-15-type assault rifle.The first AR-15s were designed in the 1950s by Eugene M. Stoner, a Marine and inventor, who developed the weapon to military standards and for military service.It was an atypical rifle for its time, seemingly futuristic, and made partly with lightweight plastics and aluminum that traditionalists scorned. It fired a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet  a .223  that was also considered revolutionary. The rifle was capable, via a selector lever, of semiautomatic or automatic fire.In the 1960s, under Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, the Pentagon bought vast quantities of the rifle, calling it the M-16, for American ground troops in Vietnam. The M-16s firepower and reputation for lethality were necessary, in Mr. McNamaras view, to counter the Kalashnikov assault rifles carried by the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong.In this way, the M-16 and the Kalashnikov became a related pair, the assault rifle of the West springing into service as a response to the more widely distributed assault rifle of the East.A half-century later, AR-15s and M-16s are made in varied forms by multiple manufacturers, and updated versions, including the M-4 carbine, remain the standard shoulder-fired weapon for most American service members and many allies.Civilian versions have many trade and model names, but are generally referred to as AR-15s, although this name is a rough description and does not indicate whether a particular specimen of the rifle is capable of both semiautomatic fire and automatic fire, or is semiautomatic only.The police have not said whether the weapon recovered in Orlando was capable of automatic fire. Such questions are politically contentious, although depending on a shooters skill and the situation, they can sometimes be moot, as aimed semiautomatic fire from a competent shooter can be far more dangerous than automatic fire, which is harder to control and is often inaccurate.AR-15s that fire only on semiautomatic are generally legal in the United States, and are widely owned by assault-rifle enthusiasts. They are also sometimes used in crimes, and have been involved in some of the most deadly mass shootings in American history, including the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14 people, and the attack in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., which killed 26 people, 20 of them children. (That gunman also killed his mother at home before driving to the school.)The AR-15s once unfamiliar caliber  commonly called 5.56-millimeter  also evolved into a military standard. The rifle-and-cartridge combination can cause serious wounds, though the damage is determined partly by the type of bullet fired.Investigators in Orlando have yet to provide details on the bullets that were fired in the attack."}

{"text": "Elizabeth and Nick Flint were apartment hunting in Brooklyn two years ago when a friend suggested they consider Jersey City instead. The couple, who were renting in Williamsburg, wanted to buy a place.By the time we found something in Brooklyn, it was like 13 stops on the L, so we started to look at other places, Ms. Flint said. They soon realized that Jersey City had a vibrant downtown with an accessible waterfront. It was also a short commute to Manhattan.The Flints focused on Jersey City Heights, at the citys northern end. We found this area of the Heights that was untapped, said Ms. Flint, 36, a yoga instructor. The sleepy enclave had a mix of one-, two- and three-family homes and large apartment buildings. While some blocks were handsome, others seemed rundown.The couple, who now have a 3-year-old son and a newborn daughter, paid around $385,000 about a year and a half ago for a house with three bedrooms, two and a half baths and a small yard on Jefferson Avenue. Ms. Flint misses the energy of Williamsburg; where she lives now kind of reminds me of Greenpoint five years ago, she said, referring to the Brooklyn neighborhood.The Heights is one of many neighborhoods in Jersey City drawing people priced out of Manhattan and Brooklyn.As Manhattan becomes increasingly more densely populated, people are migrating to the next stop, said Michael J. DeMarco, the president of Mack-Cali Realty, which is building 6,000 residential units near the Jersey City waterfront, including M2 at Marbella, a 311-unit rental opening this month. Now theyre looking across the water and saying, Isnt that a lot closer than Bushwick or Williamsburg? Countless restaurants are now downtown. Whole Foods Market plans to open near the Grove Street PATH station in 2020. Everywhere you look around, there is something new happening, said Nicole Sorgentoni, 33, a jewelry buyer for Loft who pays $2,320 a month for a one-bedroom in 70 Columbus, a luxury rental downtown.Steven M. Fulop, the 39-year-old mayor, said of the city, Weve kind of hit our stride. He and his fiance, Jaclyn Thompson, are renovating a Victorian rowhouse that they bought last summer in the Heights.Schools remain a wild card. The city has some excellent schools, like Dr. Ronald E. McNair Academic High School, which is ranked third in the state, according to U.S. News and World Report. But others struggle.The school system is one that were still focused on improving, Mr. Fulop said.Popular charter schools have long wait lists. Mr. Flint, 40, an actor, waited in line for two days (hiring someone to camp overnight) to get his son a coveted spot in a prekindergarten charter program at Concordia Learning Center at St. Josephs School for the Blind.But many parents say schools are improving, especially downtown. The schools down here are getting better, and theyre getting better because more parents are getting involved, said Jesse Teeters, 37, an actor whose daughter, almost 6, goes to kindergarten at Public School 5 downtown.Mr. Teeters and his wife, Megan, 37, a clothing designer, bought a three-bedroom rowhouse in 2011 on First Street in the Village, a downtown neighborhood. They paid $515,000; similar properties in the area are selling for around $1 million today, he said.Jersey City, with some 264,000 residents over 15 square miles, is a collection of neighborhoods with distinct personalities. In 2010, the population was 28 percent Hispanic or Latino, 26 percent black, 24 percent Asian and 22 percent non-Hispanic white, according to United States Census data.The Hudson River is to the east; Union City, North Bergen and Hoboken are to the north; the Hackensack River, Newark Bay and Secaucus to the west; and Bayonne to the south.The varied housing stock is dispersed along wide, congested avenues and quieter side streets. While high-rises abound in waterfront neighborhoods like Exchange Place and Newport, other waterfront enclaves like Paulus Hook retain a quaint sensibility. Row homes and brownstones can be found in downtown neighborhoods like Hamilton Park and Van Vorst Park. Bergen-Lafayette, to the southwest, has 19th-century Victorian houses and brownstones, along with neglected properties.Some 9,700 residential units, mostly rentals, are under construction around the city and 16,000 more are approved, according to the mayors office.Journal Square, in the north-center of the city, has a bustling transit hub surrounded by courthouses and shopping. Quieter swathes of Journal Square, like Hilltop, offer a mix of homes, along with larger multifamily buildings. Its the up-and-coming area, said Kim Beier, a sales woman for Halstead Property.On June 1, there were 529 residential properties on the market, according to JCity Realty, with a median asking price of $399,000. Listings ranged from a two-bedroom one-bath condominium in Journal Square for $55,000 up to a three-bedroom three-bath condo downtown for $2.5 million.Bidding wars are commonplace, said Natalie Miniard, the owner of JCity Realty.Prices are highest downtown, which includes the waterfront. Of the condos (the largest category of sales there) that sold downtown between January and May, the median price was $670,000, up from $583,500 during the same period in 2015, according to JCity Realty, an increase of almost 15 percent. By comparison, the median price for a condo in Journal Square was $243,500 through May of 2016, up about 26 percent from $194,000 a year earlier.Rents also skew to the river. The median monthly rent in May for waterfront rentals was $3,000; the rest of downtown was $2,695; Journal Square was $1,825; and the Heights was $1,650, according to Urban Luxe Realty.Liberty State Park, a 1,212-acre park abutting the Hudson River, houses the Liberty Science Center and a 9/11 memorial. Visitors can take a kayak tour of the Hudson River estuary or catch a ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.Mana Contemporary, an arts center in Journal Square, is open to the public during select hours.The Newport Center Mall has four department stores, more than 130 shops, an 11-screen cinema and a 1,000-seat dining pavilion. A pedestrian promenade along Newark Avenue between Grove and Erie Streets is lined with bars and restaurants.The Jersey City school district serves about 28,000 children. Universal prekindergarten is available to all 3- and 4-year-olds in the city. There are 26 elementary schools and four middle schools, including a magnet school for gifted students. Four of the citys eight high schools are magnet schools. The districts average SAT score for 2014-2105 was 406 in reading, 407 in writing and 432 in math, compared with statewide averages of 500, 499 and 521. The New Jersey Department of Education website lists 12 charter schools.Private School Review lists more than 30 private schools in Jersey City on its website, many of which are parochial.The PATH has stops in Jersey City at Exchange Place, Newport, Grove Street and Journal Square. The trip to 33rd Street in Manhattan is around 15 minutes from Newport and around 20 minutes from Journal Square. The ride to the World Trade Center is around five minutes from Exchange Place and about 10 minutes from Journal Square.New Jersey Transit operates buses to the Port Authority from various points in Jersey City.NY Waterway ferries go to Manhattan from Paulus Hook, Liberty Harbor and Port Liberte. Light rail connects residents to various points in Jersey City and nearby towns. An entrance to the Holland Tunnel is in Jersey City.When Dutch colonists arrived on the waterfront of what is now Jersey City in 1623, the Lenape Indians were living there, according to Jersey City Past and Present, a website run by New Jersey City University."}
{"text": "MILWAUKEE  Expectations often drop when a team dips into its bullpen for a spot starter, as the Mets did with Logan Verrett on Saturday. Expectations fall further on a steamy afternoon when the ball is jumping, as it did at Miller Park, where the Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers combined for five home runs in the first five innings and seven in all.Verrett surrendered three homers in four innings, the last by Wily Peralta, the opposing pitcher, whose homer was his first in the major leagues. Verrett turned over a three-run deficit to reliever Hansel Robles, and the run-starved Mets never caught up, wasting Curtis Grandersons three hits while losing to the Brewers for the first time in six games this season, 7-4.All three of those home runs were right down the middle, Verrett said. Its tough for them not to barrel them up.The Mets also lost second baseman Neil Walker with what the club described as lower-back tightness. Walker, making his first start since he took a one-hop grounder off his chest Thursday, said he felt something when he checked his swing in the first inning. Two innings later, he came off the field, threw his glove onto the bench and headed for the clubhouse. Kelly Johnson replaced him in the fourth.Walker played down the injury.Ive had similar issues in the past, he said. From my experience, it takes a couple of days.But Manager Terry Collins said any lower-back trouble worried him, especially after seeing David Wright and Lucas Duda deal with significant back problems.We didnt have any concerns about Lucas Duda, and he ended up with a broken back, Collins said. Any time you talk about the lower back, I think its a concern to me.Granderson singled, tripled and homered in his first three times up before grounding out in the eighth. His homer, in the fifth, trimmed the Brewers lead to 5-3, but the Mets did not score again until the ninth. Ryan Braun hit two of Milwaukees five home runs.At Miller Park, the ball generally carries well when the retractable roof is open in hot weather. The conditions were perfect for it Saturday  88 degrees at first pitch.Mets shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera started the barrage in the second with a two-run homer on the first pitch after he fouled a ball off his right leg. Cabrera batted the rest of the game with a protective guard on the leg.Verrett, making his fourth spot start of the season, struggled to find the plate. He walked four, a season high, and threw 87 pitches over four innings, with 49 strikes.I wasnt commanding the zone as well as I thought I normally do, or as well as I can, Verrett said. The four walks, I dont feel thats like me, either.Chris Carter homered to left leading off the bottom of the second, into a section filled with orange-clad members of the 7 Line Army, a Mets fan group in town on an organized trip. The ball landed back on the field, and Braun tossed it to a fan in a Mets road jersey.The former Met Kirk Nieuwenhuis, a .350 career hitter at Miller Park entering the day, followed with a double, stole third and scored the tying run on a double play.Braun made it 3-2 Milwaukee with a home run to dead center in the third. An inning later, Peralta drove his first career homer to left-center with a runner on. Verrett twisted in disgust at the moment of contact, and Peralta leisurely circled the bases.Eighty pitches in four innings? Thats a lot, Collins said. If you give up homers, you give up homers. But hes too much of a strike thrower.Collins said the Mets pitching coach, Dan Warthen, had talked to Verrett about issues that have to get corrected because he has to throw all his pitches for strikes.Scooter Gennett and Braun hit back-to-back homers in the seventh off the left-hander Antonio Bastardo. The home run by Gennett, a second baseman, was just the second of his career against a left-hander; he has 24 against righties.This is a team that can do it, especially in this ballpark, Granderson said. I watched their batting practice a couple of days ago. Carter and Braun definitely arent unfamiliar with the long ball. Thats definitely part of it, especially when you got guys who are strong and have the ability to put themselves in plus counts.INSIDE PITCHJIM HENDERSON, who left Friday nights game, had the torn nail on his right middle finger repaired at a nearby nail salon. Henderson had a similar problem while pitching for the Brewers from 2012 to 2014 and returned to the same salon that had fixed it the previous time.  JEURYS FAMILIA credited a slight change in the position of his front foot, suggested by DAN WARTHEN, for improving his control. Familia retired all six batters he faced Thursday and Friday, with four strikeouts."}
{"text": "Despite his genial persona, David Schwimmer is drawn to characters who are struggling, broken, flawed and in pain. But the main guy in Bankerot, the Danish show that inspired AMCs Feed the Beast, Mr. Schwimmers new series, was so drunk and despairing that even he had to draw the line.I have to say, my heart really went out to him, he said, laughing. But it was our job to try to create a compelling character out of a man in this place of absolute sorrow and a lack of enthusiasm for life.In Feed the Beast, Mr. Schwimmer plays Tommy, a grieving sommelier raising a son who has gone silent since witnessing his mothers death in a hit-and-run. Jim Sturgess is his lifelong friend Dion, a coked-up ex-con chef who thinks that the best thing for them all would be to open a restaurant in their native Bronx. Even though he burned down their last one and owes a huge debt to the mob.Its been quite a year for Mr. Schwimmer, 49, with a well-received portrayal of Robert Kardashian in FXs The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story and this, his first role as a series regular in more than a decade. Now living in the East Village with his wife, the British artist Zo Buckman, and their 5-year-old daughter, Cleo, the man forever known as Ross on Friends talked about the art of the pour and the enduring appeal of a certain series. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Youve resisted signing on as a series regular since Friends ended in 2004. So why this one?When I look at making such a big commitment, I look for a couple of things: Is the character someone that I really love and feel like Ill be challenged by playing? Is the showrunner someone I can see being married to for six or seven years? Is he going to be my partner in crime? And I felt that right from the first meeting with Clyde Phillips. But the fact that it shoots locally made the decision much easier, because I dont want to be away from my daughter.Did you train to play a sommelier?My first call was to my buddy Josh Nadel, who oversees all the wine and beverage for Andrew Carmellinis restaurants. I said, Youve got to give me a crash course. So wed do tastings and talk about the different regions. And Id videotape him opening bottles and pouring with that gentle turn of the wrist, so theres no spill while youre presenting the label the entire time. Id thought I had a little knowledge about wine. Now I realize I know nothing.Is that real wine on the set?The wine is different combinations of grape and cranberry juice. There was only one scene where I requested a real bottle, because they were going to use an extreme close-up of the pour. I bought it myself, because I wanted those wine freaks out there to be happy when they watched. I had to taste it, so we had to be careful. I had a lot of dialogue, and I didnt want to be buzzed.Any summer plans?Im taking my daughter to Chicago, because my [Lookingglass Theater Company] has a summer program for kids. So were going to do a father-daughter theater camp for two weeks.Friends is hugely popular on Netflix with millennials. Are you surprised?Im amazed by it. And it makes me wonder, will Friends have legs when my daughter is of age? What is it about the show? Is it that sense of nostalgia: Wow, thats what the 90s were like? Could it also be that its a show before texting and social media became prevalent, so the idea that six people could sit on a couch and talk is just so foreign an idea to young adults? These days theyre all together sitting on a couch, but theyre looking at their devices instead of each other."}

{"text": "RE: ROCK N ROLLIn an adaptation from his new book, But What if Were Wrong? Cluck Klosterman ponders who future historians will remember from the 20th centurys most popular musical genre.The mistake in discussing who will last in rock n roll is to assume that what rocks your world is what is likely to stand for all time. Its all context and perception, and I think Klosterman nailed it in the line everybody who was around for punk and disco is dead and buried, and no one is left to contradict how that moment felt. Right: You had to be there. But be where, exactly? Everything is relative to myriad cultural, psychological and historical factors.What Klosterman leaves out of the discussion is the primordial soup out of which the genre grew. Thats where, from a white perspective, the real transgression lay, in rhythm and blues, race music, black vocal groups, gospel, blues and even in early country and western and hillbilly music.Which is why, for my money, if we are going to suggest transgression as a criterion for rock durability, we cant overlook Little Richard. While nothing shocks us today, what could have been more rebellious and shocking in a 1950s context than a black man pounding out secular gospel music to a white audience? Like his contemporary Jerry Lee Lewis (who was also eventually pulled apart by trying to exist in the contradiction between the sacred and the profane), Little Richard violated perhaps the ultimate social decree of the time: using a sacred musical format to praise the lowest of secular concerns. He offended everyone. Now thats transgressive. Michael Aubry, Evanston, Ill.Your article stops short of recognizing what will be clear 300 years from now. Bob Dylan will be sung, read, discussed and performed as the embodiment of the rock era in all its forms and permutations that he created or inspired. We already recognize that Like a Rolling Stone is by acclamation the greatest rock song. It was the tip of the Dylan iceberg. He never made an album that rocked in any conventional way? In some sense, true  in every one of his albums, he forged the essential rock reality that there is no conventional way. There is Shakespeare, and there is Dylan. Hugh E. McKay, Solon, OhioRE: KAMALA HARRISEmily Bazelon profiled Californias attorney general: a candidate for the U.S. Senate who is trying to chart a middle course on criminal justice.Emily Bazelons profile of Kamala Harris suggests another example of what I like to call the axis of difference political theory  that politicians can afford to differ from the mainstream political norm along one axis of difference, but rarely two or more, while maintaining national prominence. So, for example, Bernie Sanders can run far to the left and remain viable: As a straight white man, fringe liberal views are his only axis of difference. Conversely, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are constrained politically because they have already used up their allowable difference on the immutable characteristics of gender and race. In the case of Kamala Harris, who is positioning herself for national politics from the underdog starting point of difference along two axes, the theory suggests even less ability to stray from the political center. If the theory is compelling, and examples do abound, those who support more sweeping criminal-justice reform should not demand leadership from Harris at the cost of her political career. If this means that national politicians withhold support for causes they believe to be just, the fault lies not with people like Harris, Obama and Clinton, who take a pragmatic approach to pursuing their political goals while maintaining political ambitions. Instead, the true culprit is a political climate that tolerates so little difference. Avi Frey, Brooklyn, N.Y.Sometimes you get to an unintended destination, and so I wonder if the editors and writers intended for this issue to be a statement on the influence of women globally? From the article on Kamala Harris, candidate for U.S. Senate; the photo of female Kurdish fighters; the photo of African health workers, some of whom are female and are the first line of defense against disease; the image of a female figure as a scarecrow guarding the harvest; to your cover of a grieving woman, perhaps having lost a husband or a son to war; what powerful statements. Bravo! Well done! Beverley Morgan-Sandoz, Pasadena, Calif."}
{"text": "FRONT PAGEAn article on May 29 about a funding crisis at the City University of New York misstated the academic discipline of Stephen Brier, a CUNY professor who spoke about the systems financial straits. He specializes in urban education, not education. The article also omitted a word from the title of Mr. Briers forthcoming book. It is Austerity Blues: Fighting for the Soul of Public Higher Education (not merely Public Education).METROPOLITANA museums and galleries listing in the Long Island Calendar in some editions last Sunday about Recess, an art exhibition in East Hampton, misidentified the venue. The gallery at 87 Newtown Lane is Harpers Books, not Glenn Horowitz Bookseller. The listing also misstated contact information for the venue. The telephone is (631) 324-1131 and the website is harpersbooks.com.An article in some editions last Sunday about family-run Italian restaurants in Westchester County misstated the given name of a daughter of Maurice Giliberti, the owner of Sams in Dobbs Ferry. She is Melissa Giliberti, not Megan.SPORTSAn article last Sunday about Garbie Muguruzas victory over Serena Williams in the final of the French Open misstated, in some copies, the point in Williamss career when she began working with her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. It was in 2012 after losing in the first round of the French Open  not in 2014 after she lost at three major tournaments in a row.SUNDAY BUSINESSAn article on May 29 about the economic costs of long security lines at airports gave an outdated figure for the fee that the Transportation Security Administration imposes on airline tickets. It is now $6.50 per flight leg, no longer $2.50. The article also referred incorrectly to a request for the T.S.A. to publish accurate data about lines at airport security checkpoints. It was a lobbying group, Airlines for America, not American Airlines, that made the request. Also, the group asked that the data be made more freely available. It did not specify how the T.S.A. should collect it.An article last Sunday about signs of rising wages as the labor market tightens misspelled the surname of the Economic Policy Institutes director of research and policy, who tracks wage trends. He is Josh Bivens, not Bevins.MAGAZINEA picture caption on June 5 with an article about living in New York City at 800 feet described incorrectly the construction workers shown at 3 World Trade Center.

A picture of the Aire can be found at nytimes.com/realestate.ARTS & LEISUREAn article on May 22 about the remake of the mini-series Roots misstated the name of the ranch where the original series was filmed. It was Hunter Ranch  not Disney Ranch, which was used as a location for Roots: The Next Generation.An article last Sunday about the Performance Mix Festival misstated the surname of the festival curator. She is Karen Bernard, not Barnard.Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about recent and coming portrayals of Charles Manson in television and film misstated the title of Karina Longworths podcast about Hollywood. It is You Must Remember This  not Charles Mansons Hollywood, which was the name of a 12-part series on the podcast. The article also misquoted Jeremy Rosen, a producer of the film The Family. He cited Making a Murderer, not Making a Murder, when talking about a recent surge in interest in shows about cult leaders and serial killers.BOOK REVIEWA review on May 29 about From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime, by Elizabeth Hinton, re-ferred incorrectly to the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act of 1961. It was passed by Congress, as all federal acts must be; it was not established by John F. Kennedys executive order.Because of an editing error, a roundup review of cookbooks on June 5 misstated the surname of the author of Vegan, Vegetarian, Omnivore at one point.

{"text": "Heres how to tell if youre watching a buddy-cop movie. Has a cop on foot flagged down a civilian to borrow her car? (Police business!) Is there a bluesy soundtrack? What about a bureaucrat absolutely losing his mind about the off-the-book antics of a renegade officer? If the answer is always yes, then you could be watching one of four Lethal Weapon movies or three Rush Hour installments or maybe even Turner & Hooch.But if theres a ripped C.I.A. officer who is haunted by his high school days and prone to discussing unicorns and John Hughes films (Ill never be like Molly Ringwald!), youre probably enjoying the new, genre-expanding Central Intelligence.Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Were the Millers) and due June 17, the buddies are Bob, a former nerd turned buff C.I.A. officer (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Calvin (Kevin Hart), the unlikely civilian Bob worships thanks to an act of kindness back in the 90s.Hes somewhere between Jason Bourne and Tom Hanks in Big, Mr. Johnson said via phone of Bobs off-kilter personality. High school bullying has left him frozen in time even as six hours of reps every day for two decades have made a killing machine out of him. Though he has transformed himself physically, inside hes the same guy, Mr. Thurber added. People from high school still have that same power over you.When Bob contacts Calvin, now a frustrated accountant, its on Facebook on the eve of their 20-year reunion. Call it the buddy-cop genres Big Chill.Its hard to put something new into the mix, Mr. Thurber said. Those grooves are very well worn.Is the world ready for an oversharing duo with their souls on their ripped sleeves? If you dont have heart, then you dont care about the characters, said Mr. Thurber, who added that he first saw sweetness enter the genre with the 2012 hit 21 Jump Street. You have just a disposable joke machine, and that can never be someones favorite film.Here are other highlights (and lowlights) from four decades of buddy action films.Directed by Walter HillThe Buddies The grizzled San Francisco cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) bails Eddie Murphys flashy con man Reggie Hammond out of prison for two days to help him catch the cop-killing members of his old gang.Initial Love Level Low. We aint partners, Cates tells Hammond. We aint brothers, and we aint friends.Signature Chase Scene City bus versus Cadillac.Grudging Respect Level High (but only after beating each other to a pulp). Hes got more guts than any partner that I ever had, Cates grunts.Directed by Richard DonnerThe Buddies A suicidal, chain-smoking widower cop (Mel Gibsons Riggs) is teamed with a middle-aged family man (Danny Glovers Murtaugh) who is getting too old for this. Theres a heroin ring to be foiled and hostages to be saved.Initial Love Level Tentative. You ever meet anybody you didnt kill? Murtaugh wonders.Signature Scene Riggs handcuffs himself to a suicide jumper and leaps off the edge of a building. (You wanted him down, hes down.)Grudging Respect Level Enormous. Riggs becomes a de facto part of the Murtaugh clan. Hence, three sequels.Directed by Martin BrestThe Buddies The chain-smoking ex-cop turned bail bondsman Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) has to elude the mob, the F.B.I. and rival bounty hunters to get Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin), a rogue accountant known as the Duke, to Los Angeles before his bond expires.Initial Love Level Low. You know why you have an ulcer? Because youve got two forms of expressions, silence and rage, the Duke tells Walsh.Grizzled Captain The F.B.I. agent played by Yaphet Kotto. (This thing is gonna give me a heart attack before its all over.)Signature Chase Scene Heavily armed helicopter versus sedan on the interstate (helicopter loses).Grudging Respect Level Sky high. See you in the next life, the Duke tells Jack as they arrive in Los Angeles.Directed by Brett RatnerThe Buddies After a diplomats daughter has been kidnapped and taken from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, the showboating L.A.P.D. officer Carter (Chris Tucker) is paired with the clueless but courageous Hong Kong cop Lee (Jackie Chan).Initial Love Level Low. Carter, determined to solve the case himself, mocks Lees haplessness. Hes only going to get in my way.Grizzled Captain Played by the never not grizzled Philip Baker Hall.Grudging Level of Respect Higher after a bonding moment in which Carter teaches Lee how to really groove to Edwin Starrs funky War.Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher MillerThe Buddies Two baby-faced rookies (the brawny Channing Tatum and the brainy Jonah Hill as Jenko and Schmidt) take part in a special narcotics operation and infiltrate a high school rife with drug abuse.Initial Love Level Super high. (Can we be friends? Jenko asks Schmidt, impressed by his intellect, though once back at school Jenko becomes a nerd and Schmidt rolls with the cool kids.)Grizzled Captain Played by Ice Cube, who makes it clear that while he knows angry black captain may be a stereotype, he happens to be black and sometimes I get angry, so what?Directed by Paul FeigThe Buddies The hard-living Boston cop Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) clashes with Ashburn, a Type A special agent for the F.B.I. (Sandra Bullock) before agreeing to team up and foil a drug kingpin.Initial Love Level Low. You just gotta vent that furnace, Mullins says, aghast at Ashburns Spanx.Grudging Respect Level High. You are smart, and you are intuitive, and you are the best cop I ever worked with, Ashburn tells Mullins. They even bond by getting hammered and dancing to Groove Is in the Heart by Deee-Lite."}

{"text": "Here are the weeks top stories, and a look ahead.1. A gunman killed 50 people and wounded 53 in an attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., early Sunday morning, making it the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman was dead at the scene and was identified as Omar Mateen, an American citizen, the police said. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Mateen had pledged his allegiance to ISIS. Here is a timeline of the attack, according to officials. Check back for more updates as we follow this story._____2. Hillary Clinton reveled in her status as the first woman to claim a major partys presidential nomination after winning four more primaries, including delegate-rich California. She embraced President Obamas endorsement, was bolstered by Senator Elizabeth Warren and escalated clashes with Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders promised to work with Mrs. Clinton to defeat Mr. Trump, but kept campaigning._____3. Mr. Trump continued to disrupt his party, saying the Republican convention should feature sports stars and winners rather than politicians. A Times special report reveals that even as Mr. Trumps Atlantic City casinos failed, he made millions  and others paid the price._____4. Court documents and almost daily revelations fed the furor over rape culture on college campuses after a California judge sentenced a former Stanford University swimmer to just six months on three felony counts of sexual assault. Denunciations of the light sentence and widespread support for the victim  even from Vice President Joe Biden and the House floor  suggest that the cultural attitude toward rape may be shifting._____5. A final tribute for Muhammad Ali: In his hometown of Louisville, Ky., celebrities and dignitaries honored and eulogized the champion, whose fame transcended sport. His widow delivered his special message to young people: It is far more difficult to sacrifice oneself in the name of peace than to take up arms in the name of violence. The sports world lost another iconic figure: Gordie Howe, 88, the longtime Detroit Red Wings player known as Mr. Hockey._____6. Will Hamilton make more history tonight? The blockbuster Broadway production is up for a record 16 Tony Awards (8 p.m. Eastern, CBS), and our reporting suggests it may walk away with 12, tying the high mark set by The Producers 15 years ago. Its already a financial winner, generating $600,000 a week in profit, a sum set to grow as touring companies start up. Its creator and soon-to-depart star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, is expected to make about $6.4 million a year._____7. Extremists across Central and Eastern Europe are feeding fears about the influx of migrants to bolster their agendas. Some are encouraging vigilante groups to patrol borders, trains and public streets, even in areas where few migrants pass. Above, a photo released in April by a group known as the Organization for the Protection of Bulgarian Citizens, which shows them in an encounter with Afghan migrants._____8.

{"text": "It is easy to feel small in Radio City Music Hall. On a recent weekday afternoon, at a tech rehearsal for the Rockettes New York Spectacular, the worlds largest proscenium arch dwarfed the dancers, who looked less glamazon than usual in their practice leggings and tank tops. But at the soundboard, the choreographer Mia Michaels seemed in no way intimidated. Its so cool to have Radio City as my playground, she whispered. Its a really big playground!For Ms. Michaels, Radio City is the biggest of the many big stages on which she has worked. In recent years, hers has become one of the most recognizable faces of commercial contemporary dance, largely through her Emmy-winning, ultraphysical and expressive choreography for Fox televisions So You Think You Can Dance. She has choreographed movies; stage shows for pop stars; and a Broadway musical, Finding Neverland. Now, Ms. Michaels is directing and choreographing Radio Citys New York Spectacular, which opens on Wednesday, June 15, and is to run for eight weeks.It was one of those things where I was like: How do the Rockettes and Mia Michaels go together? she said over coffee later that week. Im this banshee artist. Im wild, Im always looking for the thing that hasnt been done. And then you have this brand thats very traditional, very this is what it is. Ms. Michaels worked with the Rockettes before, briefly. After choreographing Finding Neverland, she was invited to create the opening number, set to Taylor Swifts Welcome to New York, for the 2015 New York Spring Spectacular. (Warren Carlyle choreographed the rest.)The New York Spring Spectacular wasnt a critical success (Charles Isherwood called it a numbingly overblown 90-minute infomercial in his review for The New York Times), but focus-group research showed that Ms. Michaelss number was a hit. It was a natural progression to ask her to come back for the whole show, said Colin Ingram, executive vice president of Madison Square Garden Productions, which produces the Radio City Spectaculars.The new version is Radio Citys latest effort to mount a successful counterpart to its annual Christmas show. The 2015 New York Spring Spectacular emerged from Heart and Lights, a show that was postponed, then canceled. The New York Spectacular, in turn, is a reimagining of the New York Spring Spectacular. Audience feedback from that show had asked for an increased Rockette presence, and Mr. Ingram and his team expect Ms. Michaelss entirely new choreography  her Welcome to New York number remains, though updated  to show the dancers in a new light. (Were very focused on customers feedback, Mr. Ingram said when asked about how focus groups affected a shows development. Weve got this community of fans, and of course we want to listen to them.)The hope is to also appeal to a different, slightly wider audience. Weve shifted the demographic a bit from a younger child and family to a preteen audience, Mr. Ingram said. We see these wonderful athletic ladies with a bit of sass and sexiness. I think people who enjoy contemporary work and more pop culture will enjoy it.Ms. Michaels has had experience with theatrical spectacles before: In 2002, the Italian-Belgian director Franco Dragone, known for his work with Cirque du Soleil, picked her to choreograph Cline Dions Las Vegas show, A New Day. Working with Mr. Dragone was like sitting next to Fellini, she said. Before that, she was a choreographers choreographer  the vocabulary and complexity of movement, those were my main goals. Franco said: No, no. You need to understand the eye of a child, the simplicity of how to open things up in space, so it becomes like visual candy.Those lessons came in handy for the New York Spectacular. Along with plenty of technical razzle-dazzle (immersive video projections, a booming soundtrack), the show has at its center a story told from a childs point of view. (Mr. Ingram said one goal was to strengthen the dramatic thread; the book is by Douglas Carter Beane, a playwright whose credits include The Little Dog Laughed and Xanadu).A couple who once lived in New York come back to show it to their children but become separated from them at Grand Central Terminal. The kids  a bratty, iPhone-obsessed girl and her younger brother  follow their parents itinerary through New York, with a little help from famous statues (George M. Cohan, Alice in Wonderland) brought to life by the brothers imagination.Stylistically, Ms. Michaels is something of a gamble for this show. While the Rockettes are known for their streamlined look and control, Ms. Michaelss movement celebrates awkwardness (Genius lives in the awkward, she says) and a sense of breaking free  an impulse, she says, that originated in her childhood, when she wore braces to fix her turned-in hips.I like sickled feet, where the foot almost looks broken, Ms. Michaels said. I love shoulders pulled up to the ears. And I hate bevels  the neutral Rockettes pose, with the standing leg slightly turned out and the opposite knee drawn to the center, giving the impression of one elongated leg.Her process, too, is somewhat unpredictable. The Rockettes are accustomed to quickly picking up clean, finished choreography, but Ms. Michaels fine-tunes from beginning to end. In January, she began relating her movement to Karen Keeler, the director of Rockettes creative and the associate choreographer for the New York Spectacular, and to the assistant choreographer Katie Walker. Once a number was, for the moment, set, Ms. Keeler and Ms. Walker would then workshop it on 18 Rockettes, going back to Ms. Michaels for further adjustments before transferring it to the full lineup of 36 dancers.Mia works from the inside out, Ms. Keeler said. And my job is the exact opposite  I have to be the voice of reason, dealing with the logistics and how the Rockettes formations can work, how the movement can have the breadth she wants, but also have the precision were known for.Lindsay Howe, a Rockette of 14 years, recalled that while creating Money, the number the Rockettes were rehearsing on that recent afternoon  set on Wall Street and scored with a sinister remix of Money Makes the World Go Round  Ms. Michaels stopped rehearsal. She went, Wait  I would be disappointed if I got this far into a number, and I didnt see a kick. But were gonna make it a Mia kick, Ms. Howe recalled. So she added this giant dvelopp whack! Clearly shes thinking about creating for us as Rockettes but making it new and fresh.Ms. Michaels said she had learned plenty herself, noting that even on a stage as large as Radio Citys, coordinating 36 dancers requires her to find inspiration in constraint. Put me in a box, and Im going to create something in every single angle and inch of that box, she said. You will never know youre in a box by the end of it. Because I dont believe in boxes.The end product, she said, is two extremes marrying each other, the structure of the Rockettes rubbing off on Ms. Michaels, her own twists on dance norms enlivening the Rockettes routine.I didnt go in there to change the brand, Ms. Michaels said. I went in to try and infuse it with some new energy and life and vocabulary. These are 36 powerful, beautiful women who are much more than just a kick line."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Hillary Clinton greets Elizabeth Warren in the cream-and-coral sunroom of her home on Embassy Row.Elizabeth, welcome, Clinton says, smiling stiffly. I was worried that you were lost since it was taking you so-o-o-o long to finally get here.Hahaha, Warren replies. Ive always heard youre a hoot in private. I know I was the last Democratic woman in the Senate to endorse you but Bernie and I have more in common. We dont buckrake on Wall Street. People are enthusiastic about us and believe what we say. Were pure.Pure scolds, Hillary sniffs. I guess it hit you, when you saw me fighting for my life against a dyspeptic 74-year-old socialist with one suit, that if you had jumped in, you could have been the first woman president.Yes, Warren muses. I only loaned Bernie my progressive hordes. Im the real leader of that movement.Not anymore, Hillary says.Warren sighs. True, my faithful are peeved at me for not running and for endorsing you instead of Bernie.Hillary pours herself some coffee. I know youre intrigued by the idea of being my vice president, she says. I heard you tell our gal Rachel Maddow that youre prepared to be commander in chief. But you know I cant put you on the ticket, dont you?Because the country isnt ready for two wonky women for the price of one? Warren asks dryly.No, Hillary says, biting her biscotti, Im not ready. You, the so-called Sheriff of Wall Street, attacked me as the Shill of Wall Street. Why should you get the glass slipper when you were foot-dragging on my glass-shattering moment?Warren protests, I went up against that loud, nasty, thin-skinned, mud-flinging, money-grubbing, racist, sexist, reckless, pathetic loser Trump. You were flailing around, not knowing how to take on that repugnant bully until I showed you the way on Twitter.Yeah, Hillary says sarcastically, youre a big help on Twitter. Trump is tweeting out video from 2004 where youre trashing me as the scary part about democracy for taking campaign donations from the banking industry and then voting for an anti-consumer bankruptcy bill that would have helped the credit card companies.Warren smiles primly, sipping her Pellegrino. Speaking of credit, you have to give me some for this: In my last book, I left out the stuff I had in my previous one about you being an unprincipled sellout. By 2014, when that one came out, it looked like you were going to go the distance. My purity sometimes gives way to expediency.You know all the Democrats want me on the ticket to add some sizzle since the crowds you draw wouldnt even fill this couch. I know you are afraid I will overshadow you and I will. But I can help you reel in all the young women who find you more shifty than nifty. And the Bernie Bros dig me.Thanks, Pocahontas, Hillary replies, looking steely. I can do some things on my own. I did manage to secure a spot in the Ivy League without pretending to be Native American. I hope you noticed that Ive decorated my house in all the colors of the wind.Warren bristles, Church Lady-style: You have done a fine job here, except that one painting looks crooked, Hillary. Im surprised you dont have oil portraits of Goldman and Sachs. And let me give you some free advice: Now that Bernie and I have forced you to address income inequality, you might want to hide that $12,495 tweed Armani jacket you wore on the trail in the back of your closet.The senator from Massachusetts stands up. Wheres the bathroom? she asks. Can I squeeze in there with the server?Hillary gives that big laugh that indicates she is not amused. No need to go on the warpath, she says in her best Cersei manner. Lets bury the hatchet  in The Donald.Warren exhales and sits back down: Youre right. The sisterhood has to be united in supporting the first woman leading a major ticket against the worst misogynist leading a major ticket. Can you believe Trump said he broke the glass ceiling by promoting women in construction? The only glass he knows is the mirror. And the thrice-married huckster had the nerve to tell evangelicals here Friday that marriage and family are the building blocks for success. That dog gets my blood boiling!He calls me Goofy? Picture America under this Mad Man. Hed want us gussied up in gingham aprons, baking casseroles. Remember that horrible crack he made about Ivana? I think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing, he said. The softness disappeared. Ill show him softness disappearing. He also said, When I come home and dinners not ready, I go through the roof. A Trump Supreme Court would take away abortion rights and bring back those hideous vaginal probes. Hillary, think about it  they might even outlaw pantsuits. That tyrant would drag women away from their desks and exile them to the kitchen and the nursery.Hillary nods rhythmically: Trumps the one who belongs in the nursery. Hes so needy, he even needs to talk to those scorpions in the press.Warren agrees, Thats the craziest thing he does. Nuts.Hillary ushers her guest to the door. Were going to be a great girl squad, she says, squeezing Warrens hand. It will be so easy to beat this airhead. I bet he doesnt even know what Cafta is. Sorry to cut this short. I need to call Tim Kaine. But I will dictate a nice tweet about you."}
{"text": "For this beauty issue, we rounded up stories that come at the subject from a number of different angles. Theres a portfolio of individualistic fashion models whose faces we find idiosyncratic and alluring. And then there are the stories that challenge the superficialities of such a complex term. Physical beauty is only a small part of what makes the otherworldly dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones so compelling. Hes harnessed that, along with his deep well of anger and sadness, to make his confrontational and often discomfiting work for over 40 years. Wyatt Mason writes an appreciation of Jones, and what it means to be a late-career artist whose undimmed artistic impulse is now joined with the mind and body of an aging man.Often we think of natural beauty as God given, but gardens, whose beauty has long been rendered in painting, poetry and prose, represent a tussle between the will of nature and that of man or woman. For 18 years, the Italian writer Umberto Pasti has been involved in a passionate love affair with the rocky, inhospitable, but mythically beautiful countryside south of Tangier, coaxing it into a sublime, subtle and botanically rich paradise. A garden like this one is not a vanity project  its sweet surrender.On the other side of the world, Michael Kimmelman introduces us to the moving work of Alejandro Aravena, the Chilean architect who recently won the Pritzker prize, and is currently the curator of the Architecture Biennale in Venice. Aravenas buildings are not flashy manifestations of outsize ego and ambition, but rather address the basic desires of his clients, many of whom are low-income families and the displaced. Social architecture can seem less elevating than swooping torques of glass and titanium, but who would deny the beauty inherent in an intellectually and aesthetically rigorous solution to an urban or social issue? I keep thinking about a story that Kimmelman was told, about a woman who lives in one of Aravenas housing developments. Her new home fits a bathtub; her bedroom, a queen-size bed  like in the movies, the woman said to Aravena. What she meant, he elaborated, was that now she can have a life of the imagination. Needs are not desires."}
{"text": "So it turns out everything with Arya was more or less what it appeared to be last week.At least thats how it appeared in this weeks episode of Game of Thrones. (With those crazy faceless types, you can never be sure.) But after lots of speculation about whether the Waif attack we saw on the bridge was really what we saw, that seems to be, in fact, what we saw. Arya was actually wounded, and the Waif was really after her.Aryas flight for her life was exciting but ultimately somewhat anticlimactic in an uneven eighth episode of Game of Thrones. The odd behavior we saw last week  Arya strolling about the city as if assassins werent after her  was, it turns out, just odd behavior, not a feint masking some clever twist to come. The intriguing Lady Crane, who seemed as if she could become more significant, was killed in perfunctory fashion by the Waif.In the end Arya lured her pursuer, as many initially expected, to the hidy-hole we glimpsed two weeks ago, when her extinguishing of the candle presaged her plan of attack. Namely, to use the very sightless fighting skills she learned through the Waifs beatings to dispatch her former teacher, before mounting her head on the wall of the House of Black and White.Um, you passed!, Jaqen told her, either because that somehow had been his scheme all along, or because she had her sword at his chest. A girl is finally no one. Congratulations!Negative, Arya replied. Im still me and Im going home.Im happy to hear it, but I am still left wondering a few things. Like how she was able to perform such physical feats so soon after such a savage, knife-twisting-in-the-guts attack? Or how did all the sweeping, body cleaning and blind-begging she did for the Faceless Men teach her parkour? I suspect the answer is some form of, You know, magic  we did see her drinking from the poison pool and these are, after all, people who change faces as effortlessly as you or I might change our socks. The conventional rules of physics clearly dont apply to the House of Black and White or its residents, and I dont want to obsess too much over details of verisimilitude.Its just not all that satisfying. After endless stick-beatings and the events of last week, it all seemed a little too tidy.The larger issue is that the show burned a lot of calories over the past couple of seasons on Aryas mostly uncaptivating assassin training, only to have her arrive where we expected her to: reaffirming her sense of self and off in search of greater adventures. Will she be more adept going forward, and did her apprenticeship in no one-ness provide the chrysalis phase crucial to all callow youths turned formidable warriors, be it Luke Skywalker or Daniel Larusso? Yes and yes. But it also felt as if the show had her spin her wheels until things were ripe in Winterfell for her return. A man is underwhelmed.The needle remains similarly unmoved, in the big picture, at Riverrun, where after some saber rattling, Jaime took over the castle and Blackfish, whom we never even knew we were supposed to care about until a few weeks ago (and thus didnt, really), died in a presumably clumsy swordfight offscreen.Two armies may have been squaring off in what looked like a siege, as Pod helpfully pointed out, but the real action was in the tents. Brienne, who arrived full of honor and duty as well as some smoldering longing, was reunited with Jaime. She threatened to fight him if necessary. Lets hope it doesnt come to that, he said. It didnt, because later, in the prisoner tent, he owned the whole twincest thing so convincingly that Edmure opted to betray his uncle rather than risk having his baby used as a catapult projectile. Then Jaime and Brienne shared a meaningful wave as she rowed away.One takeaway: Jaimes tortured but finely delivered monologue about his devotion to Cersei, contrasted with the swollen emotion of both his exchange with Brienne and the wave destined to launch a thousand GIFs, left me even more persuaded that Cersei is not long for this story. Jaimes devotion to her is the obstacle between him and the inner nobility that some part of him is desperate to embrace. So farewell for now, Kingslayer. Youll be a better man soon.Speaking of Cersei, things escalated in Kings Landing and it didnt work in her favor, as usual. On the one hand, she did have the satisfaction of seeing Mountainstein pop the head off a Sparrow as if it was a fleshy bottle cap. (Big week for trailer moments: We got both the I choose violence line and Aryas flying leap.) But soon she learned that her foolproof plan to win her freedom through trial by combat was not actually High Septon-proof.Thats who I assume convinced Tommen to end the procedure, dooming Cersei and Loras to some sort of Old Testament tribunal. Adding insult to injury, Cersei is probably pretty sick of having her old twin pillars line thrown back in her face.In the east, terrible jokes gave way to bombardment, as invading slaver ships pummeled the pyramid of Meereen in a scene that, with its combination of gloomy hues, harsh geometry and bursts of fire, incongruously reminded me of Blade Runner. (Another tale about culture clashes and what it means to be human in an increasingly inhuman world  plus Tyrells!)No more talking from you, Grey Worm told Tyrion. Your talking gave us this. Youll recall that Tyrion was feeling smug a few weeks ago about his negotiations with the slavers but heres the thing, Tyrion: Theyre slavers. Theyre terrible, untrustworthy people. Grey Worm and Missandei knew it, but he waved them off.Lucky for him Daenerys Targaryen made her fortuitous return, as foreshadowed throughout the episode. Drogon flapped away in the distance, ideally on his way to incinerate the slaver ships. But knowing him, probably not  perhaps Theon and Yara will arrive and well get what I think would be our first big naval battle. (The Battle of Blackwater was ships versus city.)Too bad Varys wont be around to see it. At this point, Game of Thrones is just toying with us, repeatedly giving us mere scraps of the Tyrion-and-Varys show, one of the most sublime pairings on a series filled with great ones, only to tear it asunder. I guess the eunuch support group I proposed last week will have to make do with one less member.Thank the Lord of Light we had the Clegane Chronicles to carry us through the week. After awhile dabbling in humble service, the Hound was looking mighty Hound-like on Sunday, vengefully wielding his ax and rhetorically dismantling those he just axed. Youre [not good] at dying, you know that? he told one.It was one of several excellent lines  the guy spent the entire episode making up for lost time in the quip department. It turned out that the Brotherhood pillagers had defied their own group by decimating the Hounds settlement. We learned that from the oft-killed Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, his resurrector, who both returned to the story for the first time since the Hound killed Beric, briefly, in Season 3. We all bloody die except this one here, the Hound said on Sunday. After some negotiating about who would get to kill the scoundrels, a deal was struck. Youre getting old, Clegane, someone said. Hes not, he replied, kicking a condemned mans stump out from under him.Which is to say, Brother Rays preachings against violence dont seem to have sunk in. Now the Brotherhood has its own plans for the redemption of Sandor Clegane, involving cold winds rising in the North that weve seen ourselves a time or two.You can still help a lot more than youve harmed, Clegane, Beric said.Whatever Beric. If you really want to help, just find the man a couple of chickens. I know Aryas killing of the Waif was on-brand, illustrating the dark-fighting skills she spent her blind-time refining. But between that and the offscreen death of Blackfish, it felt as if the producers were saving up their stunt outlay for next weeks Bastard Brawl 2016. It wasnt entirely clear what the surrender of Riverrun means for Sansas hopes for Tully support in the fight in the North. I dont really expect the broken Edmure to rally the troops, but I suppose the possibility still technically exists. The biggest tragedy of Briennes sad departure was that it robs us of further training sessions between Pod and Bronn. Lesson No. 1, Bronn told him. Assume everyone wants to hit you. Words to live by. That said, I was slightly disturbed by this exchange: I thought youd be dead by now, Bronn said. Not yet, Pod replied. Game of Thrones, I beg of you: Dont kill off poor Pod. From Tyrion to Brienne to Kings Landings women of ill-repute, all the man has done is serve with humility and grace. This is Dany were talking about  so far shes more prone to spinning wheels than breaking them. It could take her another season and a half just to get back to Meereen. I wrote that a couple of weeks ago. Maybe that fire really did transform her. So what did you think? Were you as underwhelmed as I was by much of this episode? Any guesses what that rumor Cersei and Qyburn discussed might refer to? Whats your favorite translator joke? Please weigh in in the comments."}
{"text": "Send your workplace conundrums to workologist@nytimes.com, including your name and contact information (even if you want it withheld for publication). The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.A member of my department has been giving me the silent treatment for a month. She doesnt even respond to Good morning.I know why shes mad. I got upset about something she did that I felt ignored my contributions to our department. When she refused to talk to me about it, I sent her an email explaining.I dont need to be her best friend; I just want to be able to relate to her in a normal way. The original slight still sticks in my craw, so its hard for me to mend the fence, but the current scenario is completely dysfunctional. She is an older lady, quite beloved in our workplace because she works hard. But she is passive-aggressive and prone to tizzies.Do I apologize even though I dont feel as if I did anything wrong? Do I confront her? Buy her flowers and chocolate? Please give me a strategy for going forward. ANONYMOUSAn important side note: Sending an email to explain grievances is often a bad idea. Electronic communication has many advantages, but emotional nuance isnt among them. Even the most carefully worded critique can easily be interpreted more harshly than intended.Factor that in as you consider your next move. It matters, because chances are good that youre not going to get anywhere if you refuse to accept some responsibility for whatever has gone haywire here. You may feel you havent done anything wrong, but clearly this other person sees things differently  and you cant simply dismiss her point of view if you want to improve the situation.So, yes, you should apologize, but only for what you genuinely regret. In this case, that may mean a conversation that starts with some variation of: Im sorry I said things in that email that probably came across in upsetting ways, and I wish I hadnt. But I respect you, and its important to me that we have a positive working relationship, so I really want to clear the air. If you must rehash your own grievances, do so in neutral terms: I know you wouldnt intentionally slight me, but because of X, I felt Y.Many workplace disagreements can be sorted out, and sometimes the resulting relationship is stronger and better than ever. But someone has to step back, take a longer view and recognize that such disagreements are not worth a never-ending Cold War that makes everyone unhappy. Someone, in other words, has to take the high road. Could it be you?Regarding your response to the reader whose supervisor used the phrase Jew the price down: Contrary to what you wrote, the most obvious  and least inflammatory  advice would be to let it slide.Ive heard the phrase used throughout the country (though much less on the East Coast), and there is almost never any intended bigotry involved. Its like a New Yorker saying someone gypped them, without stopping to think about the words origin.The second time its heard might be the moment to say, Do you realize thats an offensive term? Im Jewish, and it does not sit well with me. This will be followed by embarrassed apologies on the part of the speaker, 99 times out of 100.For the record, Im Jewish, too. Calm down, everybody.STEPHEN KLING, LARCHMONT, N.Y.The Workologist received dozens of varied responses to that item, but this one articulates a recurring theme: Both the offended employee and the Workologist are overreacting to a simple misunderstanding.It is plausible that the manager was ignorant of the offensiveness of the phrase, and the employee who felt uncomfortable should consider that possibility. Several readers offered suggestions for broaching the subject in a manner that avoids an implied accusation of bigotry. A lot of people dont realize it, but that term can be offensive to many. Im sure you didnt mean to offend me, but. ... One reader said that responding with My mother is Jewish has never failed me.The best comment along these lines came from a reader who recalls having used the term in ignorance, and having its offensiveness explained politely, almost sweetly by a Jewish friend. I was shocked, embarrassed and contrite, but most importantly, informed! this person recalls. So instead of assuming the worst, give the guy the benefit of the doubt and just tell him why the term is offensive.Fair enough. But I dont think saying nothing is a good idea. After all, the original advice seeker walked away from the incident feeling that the manager might indeed be a bigot. And readers, let us agree on something: We werent there. The only person who knows how it felt to hear this supervisor say that phrase is the person who experienced it.There are two reasons a person  or, for that matter, someone who is genuinely offended by the word gypped, or any such term  should not simply pretend it never happened. The first is professional: It could happen again in ways that might embarrass not just that person, but also the whole organization.The second is personal: Saying nothing ultimately leaves the offended party permanently suspicious of the person who made the remark, and probably nagged by self-doubt for failing to speak up."}
{"text": "LONDON  On June 23, tens of thousands of young Britons will be gathered at the Glastonbury music festival, whose headliners include Coldplay, Muse and Adele. Others will be avidly following the European Soccer Championship in France or biting their nails in anticipation of the next episode of hit teenage soap Hollyoaks.Oh, and there is the referendum that day asking them whether Britain should leave the European Union.Wait, are we even registered to vote? Priya Patel, 25, asked her friend recently, as they waited outside a theater in east London to see their favorite stars arrive at the British Soap Awards.Would she want Britain to stay in the European Union?Oh, definitely, Ms. Patel, a medical practitioner, answered impatiently, switching her attention to her smartphone, visibly more interested in televised dramas than in the long-running tensions between her country and Brussels.Wait, what just happened? she exclaimed as a Hollyoaks star rolled by in a car.Holding the attention of young voters  and getting them to turn out on June 23  is one of the biggest challenges for both sides in the campaign over Britains place in Europe, especially for the advocates of remaining in the European Union.Polling suggests that younger people are more favorable to continued British membership in the bloc than are older voters, and in a close race could decide the outcome.The problem for the pro-European forces is that young people are historically less likely to vote.In this case, some analysts say, it could be particularly hard to motivate them, not just because many of them will be immersed in summer activities, but also because they are being asked to embrace the status quo rather than to take up an idealistic cause of change of the type that typically energizes young people.Its hard to get them passionate about remaining, said Scott Townsin, 26, who recently directed a campaign video urging young people to vote in favor of staying in the European Union.Older voters tend to decide based on information they get from traditional media. But with young people, Mr. Townsin said, youve got to be loud, youve got to compete with brands, favorite friends, Instagram, whatever, to get their attention.Zak Reynolds, 20, from London, said he had yet to make up his mind. One of his parents will vote to stay in, the other to leave.Theres a lot of propaganda stuff, he said.Sam Hemphill, 24, an engineering student from Swindon in southwest England, said he had not made up his mind but was leaning toward Britains remaining.Part of his uncertainty, he said, was driven by the perception that the campaigns are both lying.All the facts and figures feel manipulated, which makes the decision hard, he said. They are both polar opposites appealing on emotions rather than facts.The In campaign used targeted Facebook ads to imply (falsely) that a British exit, or Brexit, could stop British soccer clubs from signing European players. (If we leave the E.U., how will Tottenham be affected? one ad asked.)The Out campaign lent its support to a pop concert in Birmingham, only to have three acts pull out because they did not agree with its anti-Europe position.The voter registration deadline was Thursday, prompting ambitious drives by both sides to sign up supporters.Groups like Bite the Ballot, an organization that tries to encourage youths to vote, teamed up with Starbucks, which favors Britains remaining in the European Union, to hold registration drives in coffee shops across the country.Uber, which has not taken a position on the referendum, flashed ads on customers smartphones reminding them to register.Some surveys indicate that half of those between ages 18 and 30 want to remain in Europe, with the proportion higher among those under 25.Young Britons are generally comfortable with a multicultural society, surveys have found, and they value the opportunity to work and travel in 28 European nations without a visa.A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of those 18 to 34 years old in Britain had a favorable view of the European Union, compared with 38 percent of people 50 and over.The 180,000 or so people attending the five-day festival in Glastonbury will have to vote by mail  a relatively tedious process  or apply to have someone else vote on their behalf. (There will be no polling booths on the festival grounds, 900 acres of farmland in Somerset, since people have to vote where they are registered.)The same voting rules apply to the 300,000 to 500,000 British fans, many of them under 30, who the police expect will travel to France for the monthlong European Soccer Championship.Some of the efforts to get young people to vote are paying off.Since March 1, more than a million people have registered to vote, with big gains among those 18 to 34 years old, according to figures published recently by the government.Ashleigh Breedy, a 34-year-old florist in favor of Brexit, said the referendum was so important that she would vote for the very first time.All that money were sending to Belgium and them telling us what to do, she said, referring to Brussels, where the European Commission is based.Our queen doesnt have a say, she said. Is Belgium going to tell our queen what to do? she asked, puffing on a cigarette and drinking a can of Red Bull. If enough of us stand up to leave, well leave.Brexit campaigners are calling for more controls on immigration and greater national sovereignty; the option of remaining is appealing to voters because of the economic benefits.Charlie Carline, 31, a British exit supporter who will be in France on referendum day, said he had made sure to vote by mail.It is very important, he wrote in a message on Facebook. I want out of the European Union dictatorship. Look at the state of Europe because of these power-ridden scum leaders.By contrast, some of the young people supporting Britains continued membership in the European Union are less passionate. For them, the monthslong campaign often felt more like well-fed Conservative politicians arguing over a dining bill.Its hard not to get bored by it, said Josh Glancy, 29, who plans to go to Glastonbury and who applied for a postal vote only because a friend had insisted. Its a kind of spat among the Tory party, so Ive become quite fed up with it.Still, he said he planned to vote to stay in Europe because he liked the idea of a Europe that can cooperate over issues including the migrant crisis.Vahan Salorian, 23, who juggles work as a composer, primary school music teacher and pub supervisor, said he would vote for Britain to remain in Europe.Ive been watching with mild terror the possibility of a British exit, he said, wearing a T-shirt decorated with avocados and sipping beer with friends in a park in east London. Im terrified it might happen.Mr. Salorian, who is from the rural town of Barnoldswick in northern England, said living in a cosmopolitan city like London shaped his views. Friends in Barnoldswick, he said, were planning to vote out even though the area has had very little immigration.Back in east London at the British Soap Awards, Jennifer Burnett, 33, said she was registered to vote, but was unsure about her intentions.She had more definite views about the soaps. I know exactly who Im going to vote for, she said. Vote Hollyoaks! she exclaimed, raising a plastic champagne cup in a celebratory gesture."}
{"text": "Republican leaders laid out a blueprint for the revival of their party after the defeat of Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies, the so-called autopsy report warned, noting that Mr. Romney had received 27 percent of the Latino vote, down from George W. Bushs 44 percent in 2004. Quoting Dick Armey, the former House Republican leader from Texas, the report cautioned, You cant call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.Yet now, Republicans are doing just that. Donald Trump has emerged as the partys standard-bearer while scapegoating Latinos and other minorities to stoke the fears and resentment of working-class white voters. Mr. Trump insists he will win Latino votes, yet he began his campaign by promising to build a wall along the border with Mexico to block out the people Mexico is sending to the United States, claiming: Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. He recently created another wave of consternation by accusing an American-born federal judge of being biased because of his Mexican ancestry.The Trump candidacy has put other Republican candidates in a bind. They can tie their lot to his immigrant-bashing campaign and hope that voter-suppression tactics will blunt the growing segments of the electorate galvanized by the prospect of defeating him. Or they can disavow him, recognizing that further alienating nonwhite voters will do severe damage to the party in the long run.Besides being self-defeating, vilifying groups of people is morally abhorrent. Republicans are signaling to millions of citizens and aspiring Americans: Youre not welcome here; this is not your home.This hostility has invigorated a decades-long effort by Latinos and other groups to increase political participation. More than 27 million Latinos will be eligible to vote in November, a 60 percent increase from a decade ago. Civic groups and Spanish-language media are making a huge push to register voters and get permanent residents to become citizens in swing states, hoping to unlock the power of a voting bloc that has historically had low turnout.If I were a Republican Party leader at the state level, Id be looking at how this could affect me now, but also at the long game, said Mindy Romero, the director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of California, Davis.Californias political evolution offers a lesson for Republicans. In 1994, Pete Wilson, then the governor, championed a ballot initiative to bar unauthorized immigrants from public services as he ran for re-election in a tight race. He won, and the initiative, known as Proposition 187, passed. But the highly divisive campaign over the measure, which was thrown out by the courts, set off a surge of political participation by Latinos that has kept the Democratic Party dominant in the state ever since.Republican leaders in other states watched California with alarm. While some have tried to make the party more inclusive, the prevailing tactic has been to underhandedly discourage minority voters. Texas and Arizona are among the states where Republican-led legislatures have passed voter identification laws and otherwise tightened voting rules under the specious guise of preventing fraud.Whites now make up 70 percent of the electorate, down from 85 percent in 1980. Demographers project that by 2060, whites will make up 46 percent of the voting pool, while the Latino bloc will have grown from the current 13 percent to 27 percent. Given those trends, its astounding that the Republican Party has taken a harder line on immigration.Its a self-defeating strategy in the long term, said Representative Joaqun Castro, a Democrat from Texas. But the focus for a lot of politicians here is the short term. A lot of them dont think theyll be in politics in 20 years.That seems to be the calculation of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. Mr. McCain, who faces a strong Democratic opponent in November, has grudgingly opted to back Mr. Trump. Most Republicans in competitive races appear inclined to do the same. A rare exception is Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, who announced last week that he could not in good conscience support Mr. Trump regardless of the political impact on my candidacy or the Republican Party.Maybe things will change after the November election, said Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona. The way to push back on all this is to have an absolute victory at the ballot box and force the Republican Party to have a conversation about what it needs to do in order to survive, he said. Of course, that is the same conversation they had, and then ignored, in 2012."}

{"text": "For all his accomplishments, including the 2011 Most Valuable Player Award, Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander had never won a start at the new Yankee Stadium. In seven previous attempts, Verlander had compiled a 4.84 E.R.A., more than a full run above his 12-year career average.But Verlander was dominant on Saturday night, reviving the form that had once made him one of the most fearsome pitchers in the game, Bronx doldrums notwithstanding. Although no longer testing triple digits on the radar gun, Verlander, like the Yankees C. C. Sabathia a night earlier, used more deception and guile than overpowering stuff to flummox the Yankees in a 6-1 win at the Stadium.Verlander has not exactly devolved into a soft-tosser (he still touched 95 miles per hour with regularity), but he mixed his pitches well to stifle the Yankees offense, which had come in averaging 5.7 runs over the past nine games and had hit .316 since June 3. The loss ended a five-game winning streak that had moved the Yankees over .500 for the first time since April 13, when they were 4-3.What makes the difference is being able to execute pitches, outfielder Carlos Beltran said of Verlander. He still has 96 in the tank, but right now, he feels he can save it for certain opportunities.Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said he was not surprised that Verlander, a former Cy Young Award winner, had found new ways to win.He mixes his pitches extremely well, Girardi said. Hes got four pitches to work with. He changes eye level with his fastball, he goes in and out with his fastball.Yeah, hes lost a few miles off his fastball, but hes still really got good stuff.Verlander (6-5) said he had struggled with the humidity but was pleased with the effectiveness of his curveball late in the game.Once you start getting second, third, fourth time through the lineup, if youre attacking guys the exact same way every time, theyll make adjustments in a hurry, he said.The Tigers (31-30) scored first with a solo home run by Nick Castellanos in the second inning. It was the first home run allowed by Masahiro Tanaka on an 0-2 pitch in his career.In the fifth inning, Tanaka was ambushed on a first-pitch fastball that Ian Kinsler (2 for 4 with five R.B.I.) hooked around the foul pole in left for his 12th homer of the season. The three-run blast put the Tigers ahead, 4-1, and ended Tanakas streak of holding opponents to under two runs at four straight starts.Tanaka was pitching on regular four-day rest for the third consecutive start, something he had never done in the majors. Historically, Tanakas E.R.A. was 3.24 on four days rest compared with 2.92 on five.Tanaka (3-2) disregarded the notion that rest was a factor in his second loss in three outings.Location with some of my pitches went where it should not have gone, he said through an interpreter. And I got hurt by that.The Yankees lone run arrived with some controversy in the third inning. With one out, Chase Headley poked a fly ball toward the left-field corner, and it ricocheted off the wall for a triple. A lengthy review appeared to show the ball glancing off the foul pole, but instead of calling it a home run, the umpires upheld the call on the field, prompting Girardi to storm out of the dugout in protest.Headley appeared dumbfounded by the decision, but he would not linger on the base for long. The next batter, Rob Refsnyder, singled up the middle on the first pitch to tie the game, 1-1.That was Verlanders only blemish. He went six and two-thirds innings and allowed five hits. He has a 2.47 E.R.A. in his last five starts with four wins  including one, finally, at this stadium.I know that there were a few starts that I had here and I did pitch well and didnt get the win, Verlander said. I also had a few clunkers. So it was nice to pitch well today."}
{"text": "TULSA, Okla.  IN the 1830s, the civilized world began to close debtors prisons, recognizing them as barbaric and also silly: The one way to ensure that citizens cannot repay debts is to lock them up.In the 21st century, the United States has reinstated a broad system of debtors prisons, in effect making it a crime to be poor.If you dont believe me, come with me to the county jail in Tulsa. On the day I visited, 23 people were incarcerated for failure to pay government fines and fees, including one woman imprisoned because she couldnt pay a fine for lacking a license plate.I sat in the jail with Rosalind Hall, 53, a warm, mild-mannered woman with graying hair who has been imprisoned for a total of almost 18 months, in short stints, simply for failing to pay a blizzard of fines and fees relating to petty crimes (for which she separately served time). Hall has struggled for three decades with mental illness and drug addictions and has a long history of shoplifting to pay for drugs, but no violent record.Tears welled in her eyes as she told how she was trying to turn her life around, no longer stealing, and steering clear of drugs for the last two years  but her fines and fees keep increasing and now total $11,258. With depression and bipolar disorder, she has little hope of getting a regular job, so she is periodically arrested for failing to pay.This time, she had already spent 10 days in jail for failing to pay restitution for five bad checks written eight years ago to a grocery store. The bad checks totaled a bit more than $100, but with fees and charges added on she still owes $1,200 in restitution on them  and thats after eight years of making payments.If I cant afford to pay it, how can I pay it? Hall asked me, as we sat in a visiting room in the jail. I cant do it.Hall survives on food stamps, castoff clothes provided by churches, a friends willingness to give her a room, and $50 a month she earns by cleaning a womans house. She allocates $40 to paying restitution, leaving her just $10 a month in cash for her and her beloved puppy (whom her neighbor looks after whenever shes jailed for debts).Its 100 percent true that we have debtor prisons in 2016, says Jill Webb, a public defender. The only reason these people are in jail is that they cant pay their fines.Not only that, but were paying $64 a day to keep them in jail  not because of what theyve done, but because theyre poor.This is as unconscionable in 2016 as it was in 1830, and it is a system found across the country. In the last 25 years, as mass incarceration became increasingly costly, states and localities shifted the burden to criminal offenders with an explosion in special fees and surcharges. Here in Oklahoma, criminal defendants can be assessed 66 different kinds of fees, from a courthouse security fee to a sheriffs fee for pursuing fugitive from justice, and even a fee for an indigent person applying for a public defender (Im not kidding: An indigent person is actually billed for requesting a public defender, and if he or she does not pay, an arrest warrant is issued).Even the Tulsa County district attorney, Stephen Kunzweiler, thinks these fines are a ridiculous way to finance his office. Its a dysfunctional system, he says.A new book, A Pound of Flesh, by Alexes Harris of the University of Washington, notes that these modern debtors prisons now exist across America. Harris writes that in Rhode Island in 2007, 18 people were incarcerated a day, on average, for failure to pay court debt, while in Ferguson, Mo., the average household paid $272 in fines in 2012, and the average adult had 1.6 arrest warrants issued that year.Impoverished defendants have nothing to give, Harris says, and the result is a system that disproportionately punishes the poor and minorities, leaving them with an overhang of debt from which they can never escape.The Supreme Court has ruled that people should be jailed only when they refuse to pay, not when they cant, and in theory safeguards protect the indigent. In practice those safeguards are chimerical, and the poor are routinely jailed for being poor. The way forward is to curb these fees, end the use by courts of private collection companies that add their own charges to the debt, and limit court debt to some percentage of a persons income.For now, some of the sums owed are staggering. Job Fields III told me he owes $70,000 in fees and fines. It seems impossible, he said, but Ive got to think positive. Cynthia Odom told me that she owes $170,000 and constantly struggles with whether to pay the electricity bill, buy food for her two kids, or pay down the debt and stay out of jail.When kids are affected like that, as they often are, this system of jailing people who cant pay fines is grotesque as well as Kafkaesque.Amanda Goleman, 29, grew up in a meth house and began taking illegal drugs at 12, and her education wound down after she became pregnant in the ninth grade. For a time, she and her daughter were homeless.But Goleman has turned herself around. She has had no offenses for almost four years and has been drug-free for three. For the last year, by her account and her employers, she has held a steady job in which she has been promoted  but she is still a single mom and struggles to pay old fines while also raising her three children, ages 2, 10 and 13.Its either feed my kids or pay the fines, Goleman said, but if I dont pay then I get a warrant. Four times she has been arrested and jailed for a few days for being behind in her payments; each time, this created havoc with her children and posed challenges for keeping a job.Webb thinks that these modern debtors prisons are so punitive that the underlying motivation is to stigmatize and punish the poor. It hurts their families, it doesnt make us safer, its expensive, she says. I cant think of another reason other than animosity toward the poor."}
{"text": "Any restaurant set directly on a harbor  where docked fishing boats and moored sloops bob just beyond the windows  makes certain implicit promises. The first, of course, is: Good Seafood Served Here.However, an equally important assurance of a harbor-front spot is: Jolly Times Had Here. A harbor isnt just any waterfront location, after all; its a gathering place for sailors, fishermen and boating families  salty types who like to spend their days reveling in the sun and spray, and like to celebrate afterward with a hearty meal and cold beer.Set on a marshy point in Guilford, amid floating piers piled with lobster traps, Guilford Mooring has, for most of its 16-year existence, largely made good on both of those unspoken pledges. It has faced some serious challenges along the way, though  most significantly, by clinging to life after enduring two hurricanes, Irene in 2011 and Sandy in 2012.There wasnt a wall standing, said Mike Romei, a co-owner, recalling the aftermath of Hurricane Irene. Mr. Romei and his partners spent the better part of a year rebuilding and renovating the restaurant, only to get blasted again by the next storm just a few months after reopening.Lets just say we got two dramatic opportunities to make improvements to the place, Mr. Romei said, laughing.Resurrected again in spring 2013, Guilford Mooring almost immediately regained its reputation as a good-times dockside destination. On a recent Saturday night, when my family and I showed up for dinner, we bypassed the slightly grim dining room (dun-colored floor tiles, walls painted an institutional green) and took a high table in the much larger, and far livelier, barroom. Here, a clearly fun-loving crowd hoisting beers and cocktails distracted from the plain dcor, and windows offered broad views over the yachts and the docks outside. (The bar also has no fewer than nine wall-mounted television screens, apparently for multidirectional sightlines onto the latest ballgame scores.)We ordered an array of seafood dishes from our charming young server, who somehow managed to make herself heard over the gradually escalating din. She also seemed to magically reappear, without summoning, whenever we needed something (more wine, a replacement for a dropped fork). Our choices ran the gamut from harbor-side classics, like fish and chips, to more creative preparations incorporating Caribbean, Asian and Mexican flavors.Overall, we were happy with our meal, but we agreed that the simpler the dishes were, the better they tasted. My mothers fish and chips arrived hot, crunchy and gargantuan (each nugget of fried cod was the size of a finger on a baseball mitt). And my lobster roll  made with steaming hunks of fresh meat, drizzled with melted butter and stuffed into the traditional split hot-dog bun  was so delicious that I ended up curling my arm around my plate to ward off my companions forks and fingers.In other dishes, though, we found that the delicate flavors of the fresh seafood were overpowered by too much goopy seasoning. My fathers blackened cod, which was wonderfully enlivened by a topping of mango-pepper salsa, was also deluged with a cloying passionfruit sauce. My husbands grilled salmon, though perfectly moist and flaky, was nearly smothered by a sticky barbecue glaze; and a shared crispy tostada topped with beautiful, ruby-colored cubes of yellowfin tuna tartare was glopped with sriracha aioli. Even a starter of fried calamari was made soggy by a dousing of Thai-style sweet chili sauce (a bowl for dipping would have worked much better).A follow-up lunch visit on a sunny weekday, when a friend and I took an umbrella-shaded table on the restaurants breezy deck, affirmed my first impressions. Though the vibe was far more serene (only a few families and wine-sipping couples surrounded us, along with sea birds floating overhead), we discovered that a tried-and-true, crispy-then-chewy heap of fried clam strips was nearly faultless. Another dish, of seared jerk-spiced salmon tacos, would have been excellent, too  if not for being saturated with coconut-chipotle dressing.Which brings me to my final, slightly contradictory assessment of Guilford Mooring: To get the most out of its jovial harbor-party atmosphere, hitting the sauce may certainly be in order. But to fully enjoy its seafood, consider asking for the sauce on the side."}

{"text": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the weeks news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.Mike: Hail, Farhad!Did you like that intro? Im getting really into Game of Thrones this season, and I think thats what people used to say when they first saw one another. Well, that or Hodor.Farhad: I read the Game of Thrones books. Hodor, said Hodor is really one of the greatest sentences ever written. Anyway, yes, hello, Mike.Mike: Hodor, Farhad. Hodor. Anyway, on with the news.I believe we have officially slipped into the doldrums of summer with slowing tech news. Nonetheless, some stuff happened.For instance, Larry Page, Googles co-founder, deciding to invest $100 million  in a flying car start-up, and also investing in one of its competitors. Clearly this guy cares little about a winning investment, and a lot about eventually getting cars in the sky.Farhad: Flying cars! The Jetsons really is coming true. Now if only someone would create a robot maid.Mike: I thought thats what Roomba was for. If only it sucked up all the dog hair in my house.In more, uh, down-to-earth news, kids aged 13 to 17 are no longer allowed to have Tinder profiles or to use the service, according to the company. I may not be the expert on how to raise children  in fact, Im legally bound by the state to never procreate  but I have a hard time thinking kids using Tinder is a good idea at all. Getting rejected every few months in high school is already hard enough, much less getting swiped left on every few minutes.This was interesting: Facebook hired Ricky Van Veen, the guy who created CollegeHumor.com, to be Facebooks head of global creative strategy, which I assume means head of getting media companies to blow up watermelons with rubber bands on live video.Farhad: I used to be a huge, huge fan of CollegeHumor. I totally approve of this move.Mike: Speaking of virality, I want to get to something that blew everyones minds this week. Three little words from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton: Delete your account.She sent them in response to a tweet from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who dissed her on Twitter after Clinton secured President Obamas endorsement. This is par for the course for Trump, and occasionally it incites a bit of banter among Clinton or other politicians.No, this particular tweet seemed to resonate  at least in part  because Clinton, or one of her 823 staff handling the Twitter account, was speaking the language of the internet to diss Trump right back. The phrase was tailor-made for Twitter to travel far and wide, to be retweeted by web pundits and blasted out by millennial outlets with subheadlines like the first burn of the general election has been scored.Since we are both scholars of Twitter, we should muse on why this seemed to tap into the viral internet so well. You first.Farhad: I was trying to explain this to my wife, who doesnt use Twitter, and I failed. I think the main reason Hillarys tweet did so well is because delete your account has a very specific, nuanced and difficult-to-explain meaning on Twitter  and the fact that Hillary seemed to know that it carried special meaning gave her some cred with Twitters leading lights (of which I am a member).Mike: Farhad.Farhad: No, but seriously, Delete your account is interesting. For one thing, it is not a literal request to delete your account. I saw some commentators saying that this was like a schoolyard taunt, the online equivalent of telling Donald to shut up, but that gets it wrong.Its more like the saying, What you said was a little ridiculous and sad, and Im going to do the hilarious thing of pretending it was so bad that you should no longer even use Twitter, and my hyperbole will itself be a mike drop. Does that make sense? If not, its probably because you dont use Twitter (which is fine).Anyway, as Philip Bump explained in The Washington Post, what was remarkable about Hillarys tweet was that she used the phrase correctly. As he wrote, Its like your uncle suddenly turned to you and said, You know whos good? [Cool underground band youre amazed hes heard of].Now, as someone whos been on the receiving end of lots of delete your accounts, I can tell you that its hard to recover from one. And thats what we saw in responses from Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, and from Trump himself.They both tried to tie the tweet back to Clintons email scandal, but the comeback felt very forced, like, Oh yeah, the jerk store called Right?Mike: Nice George Costanza reference.And youre totally right. Priebus and Trump came back way, way later after they realized that Clintons tweet landed and resonated with people like us. Their tweets felt like they were work-shopped inside a conference room for 45 minutes with a bunch of college students. The uncool ones.Heres the thing: Its cool she got a sick burn or whatever, but retweets do not equate to political activism or actual votes. Everyone loves to share a Facebook or Twitter post, but look at voter turnout over the two decades. The people who use Twitter are probably not the people doing the voting.Maybe thats the true sick burn, Secretary Clinton.I just wonder if any of these conversations amount to anything at all other than a daily news cycle and a raise for the intern who thought it up. And fun television hits for us!Farhad: Oh, I think this sort of thing has an impact. Any one tweet does not make a difference, of course, but over all, what happens on Twitter makes its way into the rest of the news either directly (when cable news shows display pictures of tweets) or indirectly, in the way it colors how reporters think about the campaign.And Id also add that Trump himself seems to take Twitter insults pretty seriously. He spent several days last month battling Senator Elizabeth Warren over some shade she threw at him on Twitter. So to the extent that his opponent can use Twitter owns to rattle him, well, why not?Also, that reminds me of something Ive been meaning to tell you: Delete your account.Mike: Fine. Also, never tweet. See you next week!"}

The mascaret was tamed when a sea wall was built in the 1960s, but the Seine still determines everyday life.After eight years of planning, Musoseine, a small, charming museum devoted to the Seine, opened in April. Among the highlights: vestiges from ancient Gallo-Roman, Viking and medieval eras; a collection of boats; videos that evoke the rivers traditions as a working water highway to the ocean; and footage of the mascaret in 1947. Visitors can watch the boats go up and down the river from a balcony built on a gribane  a flat-bottomed wooden barge.The center of Caudebec-en-Caux was largely destroyed in a fire following bombing by the Nazis in 1940, but merits a visit because of the Flamboyant Gothic Notre-Dame church, built in the 15th and 16th centuries; 333 sculpted human figures adorn its western portal. Then visitors can go on to the nearby G.a. Manoir de Rtival restaurant, which was awarded its first Michelin star earlier this year.ELAINE SCIOLINO"}

{"text": "Last year, when the actress Danielle Brooks moved into a bright, airy one-bedroom rental in a high-rise in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, she briefly considered throwing a big housewarming party. Then, on second thought, she decided on a painting party and a very limited guest list: four close friends.At the time, I had no furniture in here, so I got a big, old blue sheet, laid it out, got all these paints, and we just went at it, creating artwork for my home, said Ms. Brooks, 26, a Tony nominee for The Color Purple and  is Crayola sponsoring her career?  a standout as Tasha Taystee Jefferson in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black. (Season four will be available June 17.)The resulting abstract canvases, which are on display in the foyer, may not quite be museum-ready. But I do love them because theyre so personal  I dont bring too many people into my space, so I wanted the people I love and who love me the most to come and add to my home, said Ms. Brooks, whose version of how do you do? is a hug. Given her expansive nature, it would likely be her greeting even if she werent in show business.The apartment is one measure of how far Ms. Brooks has come up in the world  shes 26 floors up, to be exact, and the view is spectacular  since leaving Greenville, S.C., to attend Juilliard almost nine years ago. Its been a slow build, she said. But every place Ive lived has been better than the previous one.After graduation, she moved with a friend to a ground-floor apartment in Washington Heights in northern Manhattan. The ceiling leaked anytime the tenants upstairs even contemplated a bath. When Ms. Brooks began working on Orange Is the New Black, she gratefully decamped for a studio in Harlem on Madison and 117th Street.I loved, loved Harlem, she said. I could walk to my favorite restaurants, and it was really close to my church, First Corinthian Baptist. But the loft bed, built by a friend, gobbled up a lot of space, cool though it was, so it was onward ho to a one-bedroom in Rego Park, Queens.Now it was Ms. Brookss own space that was being invaded. People were starting to recognize me and kind of follow me home, and I didnt have a doorman, she said. Thus, the move to the apartment in Brooklyn, which has a gym and a roof deck in addition to an attended lobby.Its got a lot of room, but its still a New York apartment, and its still an apartment for a person at the beginning of her career. Ive made it my own, but I stay within my means, she said.Sometimes I stay below my means. The way I live is comfortable for me, continued Ms. Brooks, who places more importance on visits home and Guitar Hero sessions than she does on acquisitions. Im not one to be, Look what I have,  she said. But she is one to be, Keep what I have clean. The mat at the front door reads, If youre not God, take your shoes off.The apartment is an eclectic mix of the inspirational and the spa-inspired. The word love appears on much of the bric-a-brac, and a pillar in the bedroom is covered in looping cursive declarations such as we believe, we trust and we laugh. Candles, pillows and cushions are in abundance, with soothing white the dominant color.Theres also an enthusiastic nod to Hollywood Regency, courtesy of an applied lattice pattern on a wall just outside the bedroom, the draped fabric above the bed, a sheepskin rug in the bedroom and the many geometric light-bouncing mirrors. Then there is the sleek bar cart thats used to hold perfume bottles as well as a copy of the book Vintage Black Glamour by Nichelle Gainer (Rocket 88, 2014).To show just how much Ms. Brooks enjoys mixing it up, a wall in the living room sports a gold metallic deer head. My mother doesnt like it, she said. But I do. I like that the wall has different textures.Because Ms. Brooks loved the job that Mike Harrison, an interior designer, did on her dressing room at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, where The Color Purple is billeted, she enlisted him to help with the apartment.He is responsible for the deer head (sorry, Mrs. Brooks), the wall with the lattice pattern and the script on the bedroom pillar. Here is the brief from his client: I wanted something really cool that represented me, said Ms. Brooks, who, despite a packed schedule, kept her hand in.It was she who came up with the idea of a chalkboard in the kitchen for scribbling reminders to herself  for example, that its time to lay in a new supply of the herbal tea Throat Coat. She chose the furniture, including the custom-made heather-gray sectional. Thats the first step to adulthood, she said. No more futons. She also custom-ordered the pillow on the sofa that reads BE, part of some valuable advice she received during her time at Juilliard. Instead of getting a tattoo, I got a pillow, she said.Ms. Brooks doesnt care for clutter, but there are certain things that must have their place, among them a Bible from her mother, a minister, and a painting by the Greenville artist April Harrison that her parents commissioned as an opening night present for The Color Purple. She diligently holds onto Playbills; she collects postcards (some are displayed under the glass top of her dressing table); and she treasures the LPs that belonged to her maternal grandmother, among them albums by Sarah Vaughan and Wynton Marsalis. Theyre played on a retro-style turntable she bought on Amazon.I was going to get a Victrola with the horn and everything, but maybe thats for next time, said Ms. Brooks, whose plan is to stay put for a few years, then find a place to buy. I hope to be an owner before Im 30, she said.She envisions a two-bedroom, not so much because shes expecting guests, but because shes expecting stuff. When you have more things going on, you accumulate more things, Ms. Brooks said. She recently became the face of Lane Bryants Christian Siriano collection, so theyve given me the whole line, she said. I have clothes for days.And, of course, I have my awards, she said, pointing to the windowsill in the living room that holds trophies from Theatre World and the Screen Actors Guild.Im looking forward to having another room so I can put them all away."}
{"text": "Music stores encapsulate a moment in history, said Emily Judem, co-director of For the Records, a  documentary about the demise of the Manhattan music mecca Bleecker Bobs in 2013. When you walk into one, they bring you back to a time that seems to be disappearing.Thats especially true in Greenwich Village. It had been an artsy, progressive area associated with social change, she said. Many people still associate those changes with the Village record stores.Rebel Rebel, at 319 Bleecker Street, epitomizes that funky passion. It looks as perilous as it does alluring. Inside the coffin-narrow, gangplank-long space, cardboard boxes choke the only aisle. Theyre stacked into towers that buckle with LPs, CDs, EPs, DVDs, 12-inch picture discs, seven-inch 45s and collectibles of every kind. At the front stands the owner, David Shebiro, looking surprisingly serene.Rebel Rebel has benefited in recent years from a growing  mania for vinyl. Purchases in the format leapt 30 percent last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, generating more profit for record companies than YouTube streams.Enough of the money has trickled down to Rebel Rebel to make it marginally profitable, according to Mr. Shebiro. But that margin wont be enough to keep the store from losing its place on Bleecker Street, where it has been a neighborhood staple for 28 years.While record store closings seem as inevitable as newspaper downsizings these days, June has proved to be an especially cruel month in New York. Rebel Rebels closing, set for June 30, will follow the shuttering of another cherished Village sonic emporium, Other Music, on the 25th. Two other Village music stores have died in the last two years: Bleecker Bobs and Kims Music and Video. In the same period, Bleecker Street Records was forced from its longtime home on the street for which it was named to cheaper quarters at 188 West Fourth Street.Rebel Rebels closing is indicative of the change Bleecker has undergone. The seven blocks of the street between Abingdon Square and Seventh Avenue South now include nearly 70 stores devoted to high-end clothing, jewelry and fragrances, leaving only about half a dozen mom and pop places. The fashionistas have taken over, Mr. Shebiro said.The trend began over a decade ago, led by Marc Jacobs. He currently commands four storefronts on Bleecker, near international brands like Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors and Burberry. Before 2000, Bleecker had lots of boho boutiques, a small grocery store, a magazine shop, even a store that sold nothing but condoms, Condomania, which closed in 2007. The rumpled era of the Village, evoked in all its crusty glory in the Coen brothers 2013 movie Inside Llewyn Davis,  seems more remote each year, though the central area around Macdougal Street retains some of its falafel store grease and head shop scent. West Bleecker, by contrast, has become just another Madison Avenue, said Ngawang Choden, owner of Beautiful Tibet, a boutique dedicated to that countrys handicrafts. I feel like Im the last of the Mohicans here.Mr. Shebiro says he wasnt given a chance to stay in his space. To have a landlord call someone who has never had a problem paying rent for 28 years and say, Ive rented your space, was really disrespectful, Mr. Shebiro said. On the other hand, if we had a pair of shoes and somebody wanted to give us $3,000 for them but our friend only wanted to give us $200, wed also think about it twice.The landlord, SW Management LLC, did not return calls for comment.According to Faith Consolo, who brokers commercial real estate along the chic stretch of Bleecker for Douglas Elliman, rents for a 500-square-foot space there now average $25,000 a month, and turnover has increased. Coach, Brooks Brothers and Lulu Guinness have all recently left the block. More than a dozen storefronts are currently empty.Mr. Shebiro, 54, who grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, has never had a full-time job outside a record store. He began by working at the Village haunt Record Runner when it opened in 1979, and he stayed until he had enough money to open his own place in 1988. Mr. Shebiro chose what was then a quiet stretch of west Bleecker Street, though friends told him he was crazy to do so. Theres nothing there but antique stores, Mr. Shebiro recalled being told. But it was really sweet and quaint.He signed the lease with his first landlord, a Holocaust survivor, over tea. Mr. Shebiro named the store after David Bowies 1974 glam-rock song Rebel Rebel because he was the one who influenced me in music completely, he said, and the name had the best ring.Though Bowie never went to the store, he did act in a movie, Band Slam (2009), that featured a scene shot inside Rebel Rebel. The movie was written and directed by Todd Graff, a friend of Mr. Shebiros. The director told Mr. Shebiro that Bowie was well aware of the store. But according to Mr. Shebiro, when Mr. Graff told the star, If you go there, the owner would absolutely faint, Bowie replied, Thats exactly why I dont go.Other music stars have happily ventured into the warren over the years. Prince, who came with a beefy bodyguard, bought a Kate Bush album, a Young Disciples recording and some magazines. (The bodyguard paid.) Robert Plant wanted advice on the latest hits, and he picked up a Smashing Pumpkins album. Jimmy Page came in four times. He actually collects bootlegs of his own work, Mr. Shebiro said. He came up to the counter with one and slapped down his American Express Black Card. I didnt charge him. Another time he told me about a mash-up on YouTube of Whole Lotta Love and James Browns Sex Machine. When I played it, he came behind the counter, practically put his chin on my shoulder and said, Isnt it brilliant?In his autobiography, See a Little Light, Bob Mould, the singer of the 1980s indie-rock band Hsker D, credited Rebel Rebels owner with broadening his guitar-driven aesthetic to include dance music, inspiring a lucrative second career as a D.J.Over the years, Rebel Rebel has served as a school as much as a store. Mr. Shebiro and his sole employee, James Wiltshire, have acted as sonic Sherpas, guiding customers to sounds ideal for them. The other night, Alvero Yepez, 32, of Elmhurst, ventured into the store for the first time, announced that he liked fusion music thats trippy and spacey, and within minutes Mr. Shebiro and Mr. Wiltshire played for him a new copy of a vintage album by the jazz organist Johnny Hammond and another from the tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine. Mr. Yepez bought them both.Rebel Rebels nearly impassable aisle means curation of this kind dominates over browsing. The result has given the store a bespoke quality thats rare even among the most intimate independent music outlets. Charlie Grappone, who ran Vinyl Manias three stores on Carmine Street until their demise in 2007, said, the beauty of someone like David is that when people come in and say, What do I need? he knows. He listens to you and figures out where your head is at.Mr. Shebiro, who said he made 95 percent of his friends through Rebel Rebel, plans to take a break after the store closes. He does not know if another location will provide the same experience. It wasnt just about what was inside the store, he said. It was the community that surrounded it that made it what it was."}
{"text": "Scientists would love to know how polar bears spend their time and how much their behavior is changing as a warming planet results in less sea ice during the summer.But its not so easy to do. In a few places, like Churchill, Manitoba, bears congregate on land during the summer. But many stay on the ice or find other places to venture onto solid ground.Researchers put satellite tracking collars on some of the bears to get an idea of where they move, but would also like to get a picture of their activities and energy use.Anthony Pagano, a wildlife biologist with the United States Geological Survey, has been testing accelerometers on the collars  something like Fitbits for bears. The devices respond to activity. For people they are preset to recognize actions like jogging, and show a user how much energy has been expended.To do something similar for bears, Mr. Pagano, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has mounted both accelerometers and small video cameras on bear collars. He can then see what the accelerometer records when the collar cam shows the bear paddling, for example.Mr. Pagano has identified the accelerometer patterns that signal swimming, walking and resting. And he can use activity to determine how much energy the bear is using.Video camera batteries dont last long, but an accelerometer can record for a year or so. That activity record, combined with satellite tracking, could tell scientists if bears are spending more time searching for seals, or walking on land when the sea ice is diminished in the summer.As a nice side benefit, the video cameras have come up with some never-before-seen glimpses of life from a polar bears point of view, rather a female polar bears point of view. The collars are all on female bears because the necks of males are wider than their heads, so the collars wont stay on.Recordings show killing a seal, courting a mate, chasing a ball at the Oregon Zoo, and walking, eating berries and lapping water on land. Polar Bears International and the zoo collaborated with the geological survey in putting the collars on about a dozen bears.Mr. Pagano has not yet found a clear accelerometer signature for eating. He is still working on that, because the ultimate goal of the research is to help understand not only whether bears are using more energy because of declining sea ice, but whether they are finding less food."}
{"text": "SUNDAYs mass murder in Orlando, Fla., was, among other grim superlatives, the worst instance of anti-gay violence in American history. But it was also far from the first. In fact, mass violence and the history of gay liberation go hand in hand.Until the weekends horrific shooting, the largest massacre of gay people was an arson attack on a bar in New Orleans on June 24, 1973. Like the community that gathered at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, L.G.B.T. people had piled into the UpStairs Lounge on the edge of the French Quarter for a happy hour to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. Most of the patrons left after the celebration ended, but congregants of the local chapter of the Metropolitan Community Church, a national gay religious organization, remained.Just before 8 p.m., someone, or possibly a group of people, stopped at the entrance to the stairwell to the UpStairs Lounge, which was on the second floor of a building that had a straight bar on the first floor and a flophouse on the third. They doused the stairwell with lighter fluid, as well as the steps leading to the second floor, and then lit it. Then they rang the doorbell. When one of the patrons opened the locked door, fire exploded into the room. Within seconds, it spread through the bar, the power went out and the room filled with black smoke. The windows were barricaded and the congregants could not find their way to an exit in the back of the bar.Thirty-two people died, and many others were injured. Many of the people who died were unidentifiable, not only because the fire scorched their bodies, but also because, despite the celebration of gay liberation, many gay men were not out of the closet and used fake IDs and aliases in gay bars. Even their families didnt know they were there.The UpStairs Lounge was not the only target of mass violence during the height of gay liberation in the 1970s. Arsonists set fire to gay churches in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Nashville and San Francisco in 1973 and 1974. Six months before the fire at the UpStairs Lounge, on Jan. 27, 1973, a fire broke out at the Mother Church of the M.C.C., in Los Angeles, where a gay Jewish group met for services.Though no other attack came close to the death toll at the UpStairs Lounge, the attacks collectively set off an undercurrent of fear among the L.G.B.T. community in the 1970s: that our bars, which have been the sites of our political liberation, the focal point of our community, and even our places of worship, have also been the visible targets of violence and hatred committed against us.That fear has subsided somewhat over the last generation, to the point where for many gays, something like the Orlando shooting might have seemed almost unthinkable, until it happened. But instead, it is a reminder that anti-gay violence has never been about individual acts against individuals, but an attack against the very idea that L.G.B.T. people should be free to express and enjoy themselves in public.In the coming weeks, the news media will likely center on the culprit and his motivations in Orlando. This happened in New Orleans as well in 1973. The police and fire department spent months investigating the case, interviewing the survivors and even flying across the country to California to arrest a suspect. The emphasis on the culprit unwittingly overshadowed the story of the victims. And yet over 40 years later, no one has ever been charged for the arson, and the history of those who died in the fire soon became forgotten.As it becomes increasingly likely that Omar Mateen, the suspected gunman in Orlando, was motivated by an extremist ideology, we likewise run the risk of forgetting the L.G.B.T. victims of this most recent attack as well. Some may have not been out to their families and their sexual orientation will be revealed to them only in the morgue. Others fell dead next to a friend or a stranger. Others likely went to the Pulse nightclub alone and found hope in the promise of a gay bar on a Saturday night, where they might find a friend and a community to call their own.Fortunately, the anti-gay attacks of the 1970s did not prevent L.G.B.T. people from meeting and marching, nor did it stop them from gathering at bars and clubs to enjoy themselves. There was too much at stake. We can only hope that the same thing happens today, and that we remember that, despite progress, there is still much at stake. The sites of our liberation must not become the targets of our oppression."}
{"text": "TUESDAY PUZZLE  For those of you who might be Mini and maybe Monday solvers but who have thus far been afraid to try to push past that, behold Tracy Grays Tuesday crossword. You can do this one. Its EASY.I swear.No, I mean its literally EASY. We have a set of four, two-word theme entries whose first letters are E and Z, and the revealer at 58A is EASY DOES IT. Even if you are not familiar with some of the theme entries, the crossings are kind and you can get them that way.I was initially confused by the entry EBOLA ZAIRE because I thought that the virus was simply named EBOLA hemorrhagic fever, but there is evidence that EBOLA Zaire is a species of the virus.Viva ZAPATA! EMILIANO ZAPATA was a Mexican revolutionary who led the peasants Liberation Army of the South.Look at the run of crunchy consonants in ED ZWICKs name! Mr. ZWICK is a film and television director.You dont need me to explain what EROGENOUS ZONES are, do you?Ms. Grays puzzle is reasonably clean and except for a few shorter entries, like IN A clued as a partial, theres some good stuff here, like MIX IT UP, CROUTON, SALT PIT, OVULATION, FINE-TUNES, TAKE APART, DANCE STEP, CANOODLES and ZENO. Hyperlocal clues are tough for people outside the New York City area, but they are considered fair here because they are running in The New York Times. The N.J. city (or is it a borough?) at the west end of the George Washington Bridge is FT. LEE. Whenever you see a three-letter word clued as Comfy shoe, the answer will invariably be MOC, short for moccasin. The rule for tenses, foreign languages and slang, where the answer needs to match the clue, also holds for poetry. So if the clue is the poetic Neath, the answer has to be the equally poetic OER. The Young partner? clue at 43A is not looking for a partner that is young. It is looking for something that can be separated by the partner word and. Today, the answer is the accounting firm ERNST and Young. At 6D, I first entered PANDA, but I knew that the Duchess of Cambridge is KATE, not Pate. The answer is KOALA. See how EASY this is if you check your crossings? The fifth century philosopher ZENO offered the world his 10 paradoxes argument, the basis of which supported his friend Parmenidess idea that movement is an illusion. While some philosophers argued that ZENO was incorrect because he had failed to use calculus to prove his theorems, ZENOs paradoxes eventually became the basis of the modern philosophy on why, no matter which supermarket line you stand on, it will never, ever move as quickly as the one next to you.Lets hear from Ms. Gray.The seed entry for this puzzle was the revealer EASY DOES IT which was inspired by my Maryland E-ZPass.Phrases with the E-Z pattern were few and far between and the puzzle sat unfinished in my Crossword Compiler for quite some time until I watched Legends of the Fall for the umpteenth time and came up with the director ED ZWICK for the center entry.The puzzle was accepted in July 2015 with an email from Will and Joel that read:  Good news  were happy to say yes on your EASY DOES IT 15x, which has a nice theme.  Its not a revolutionary concept, but the revealer is fun and the set of themers youve found cover a wide range of subjects (geography, history, film, whatever category EROGENOUS ZONES is in ).Hope you enjoy solving my puzzle!That was EZ! Lets give the Wednesday puzzle a try, shall we?Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TRY TO STANCH LOSS OF INVESTORS  |  Hedge fund titans may be used to running their firms like elite clubs, but years of poor performance have forced them to open up admission,\nAlexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook.More big-name investors like MetLife and American International Group have begun to withdraw their money from hedge funds and the investors who stay get a chance to sit dictate lower fees and better terms.Hedge funds can no longer just operate on a 2 and 20 model, where investors pay fees of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gain in any year. Managers are offering lower fees for investors to keep their money in funds and setting performance targets where investors would pay a fee only if they were exceeded. And the favorable terms are not just offered to longtime loyal clients.The industry argued that a hedge fund managers job was to protect in down years and not outperform in good years, but when hedge fund returns fell with the markets last summer, the point was moot. Some of the best-known managers, including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management, have lost money.And for some investors, acknowledgement of poor performance is not enough. In September 2014, the California Public Employees Retirement System announced plans to liquidate its $4 billion hedge fund holdings because of concerns that the investment were too expensive and complicated. In April, the pension fund for New York City civil employees voted to exit its portfolio of $1.5 billion in hedge fund investments. Altogether, investors pulled $15.1 billion from the industry in the first quarter of the year  still a drop in the ocean compared with the $2.9 trillion the industry managers, but the pressure is mounting.Mr. Robbins apologized to investors recently in an effort to stem the outflow of investor money from his firm. He pledged to right the ship as quickly as possible and offered the opportunity to put more money into a new fund that would waive fees. He has continued to lose money  investors in his flagship fund had lost 6.5 percent at the end of May  so he is now offering more favorable redemption terms, allowing existing investors that add more money into the fund to step into the shoes of investors who have left.BLUE COAT TO BE SOLD TO SYMANTEC  |  Blue Coat Systems, the online security software company, is abandoning its plans for an initial public offering and selling itself to Symantec instead,\nMichael J. de la Merced reports in DealBook.\nThe company said it would sell for $4.65 billion. As part of the deal, Blue Coats chief executive, Greg Clark, will take over as the chief executive of the combined company. \nBain Capital, a majority investor in Blue Coat, will invest an additional $750 million to help finance the transaction. Silver Lake, which invested $500 million in Symantec in February, will invest an additional $500 million. \nThe company that results from the merger will combine the traditional antivirus product that has been Symantecs focus with Blue Coats new online protection services. Executives see little overlap between the two businesses. \nWith this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals, Dan Schulman, Symantecs chairman, said in a news release. \nBlue Coat had filed plans to go public and did not formally put itself up for sale, but it received interest from potential buyers and held talks primarily with Symantec. \nThe prospectus for its initial public offering said that Blue Coat lost $289 million on top of $598 million in sales for the 12 months ending April 30. But the company has been trying to expand under Bain Capital. This represented a compelling opportunity for us because we could realize some gains for our investors but also reinvest into the combined company, said David Humphrey, a managing director at Bain Capital. \nSymantec has been trying to turn around its fortunes after years of declining sales. Michael Brown stepped down as its chief executive about two months after Silver Lake invested, amid disappointing performance. Symantec then hired Ajei Gopal, a Silver Lake operating partner, as an interim president and chief operating officer. Mr. Clark of Blue Coat emerged as a candidate for the chief executive job. Silver Lake had anticipated a transaction like the Blue Coat deal and had set itself up to provide additional financing. It believes that there may still be other smaller acquisitions to come. \n\n\n\nON THE AGENDA   |  Americas Small Business Summit starts at 8 a.m. in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nWALGREENS CUTS TIES TO THERANOS  |  Walgreens said on Sunday that it was terminating its nearly three-year-old partnership with Theranos and shutting down Theranos lab-testing services in Walgreens locations,\nReed Abelson and Andrew Pollack report in The New York Times.\nBrooke Buchanan, a representative for Theranos, said the company would continue to do business using the stand-alone retail locations it already runs, apart from the Walgreens stores. It has five such locations in Arizona and one in California, she said. \nWalgreens Boots Alliance was frustrated that Theranos was not providing more detail and documentation after  learning that it had corrected tens of thousands of blood tests, people familiar with the partnership told The Wall Street Journal. \nIn light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has rejected Theranoss plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers best interests to terminate our partnership, Brad Fluegel, senior vice president of Walgreens, said in a news release. \nThe 40 blood-draw sites inside Walgreens stores in Arizona were a primary source of revenue for Theranos, as well as mark of credibility. Having easily accessible locations in corner drugstores was part of Theranoss grand plan to upend the laboratory testing business. For its part, Walgreens had hoped to add lab testing to increase traffic to stores and pick up some of the cachet of being associated with a cutting-edge Silicon Valley start-up. \nWalgreens had decided to end the partnership after regulators disclosed problems at Theranos in late January, but held off on completing it because it feared that Theranos might sue, The Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe center will inform Theranos within the next two weeks about its decision on sanctions, a person familiar with the matter said. And Walgreens had become more convinced in recent days that the sanctions would be painful.BLUE COAT TO BE SOLD TO SYMANTEC  |  Blue Coat Systems, the online security software company, is abandoning its plans for an initial public offering and selling itself to Symantec instead,\nMichael J. de la Merced reports in DealBook.The company said it would sell for $4.65 billion.

{"text": "Caught between hitting a driver or a 3-wood, Branden Grace opted for the safer play. Except that the 3-wood proved to be not so safe.Grace was tied for the United States Open lead last year with three holes to play, but his tee shot on the 16th at Chambers Bay started out to the right and never got the draw he wanted. The ball sailed over a boundary fence and beyond the nearby railroad tracks.Take that swing back, and the 28-year-old South African might have been coming to the U.S. Open at Oakmont this week as the defending champion. Though his resulting double bogey got lost in the chaos of Dustin Johnsons title-losing closing three-putt, Grace finished two shots behind Jordan Spieth, the champion, in the final count.Now Grace is seeking to take a page from his mentor, Ernie Els, and secure his first major crown at Oakmont.Its one of those things that I look back and I think its made me stronger, Grace said recently of last years Open.He certainly has been moving in the right direction. He followed up his share of fourth at Chambers Bay with a third-place finish at the 2015 P.G.A. Championship, unable, like everyone else, to catch the surging Jason Day.Grace was then the breakout performer for the International side at the Presidents Cup in South Korea. He became the first International player in 17 years to win all five matches as the Internationals pushed the United States until the final match.And less than two months ago, Grace got his first victory on American soil, turning a three-shot, third-round deficit into a two-stroke triumph at the RBC Heritage tournament in Hilton Head Island, S.C.I came close last year, a couple of close calls, Grace said before a three-week respite back home to recharge and fine-tune his game for the Oakmont test. The majors are big things, he said, adding, Its happened pretty much in a short space of time, my first full year that Im over here in the States.Five of his 10 career victories have come in the past 18 months. And when the U.S. Open tees off, it will be Grace  not Louis Oosthuizen or Charl Schwartzel  who stands as the South African with the highest world rankings.No moment is too big for him, Oosthuizen told reporters at the Presidents Cup in October.Of his first American victory, Grace said he was really excited for things to start.Now I can just tick this off the box and head into maybe the next couple of majors trying to win, he added. Knowing I have won out here before, now I can do it again.In a sense, Graces rise was only a matter of time. Talented in multiple sports as a youth, he chose golf at age 15 and honed his game in Elss youth program in South Africa.Growing up in South Africa, we grew up with team sports, Grace said. It was hard to go from team sport to individual sport. But I made the right decision and its paid off.In 2012, he turned heads with five victories on the Sunshine Tour in his homeland. The first of those came in the Joburg Open, which earned him a berth in the Volvo Golf Champions the following week at Fancourt. Grace won that event in a three-man playoff, outlasting both Els and another U.S. Open-winning countryman, Retief Goosen.That season earned Grace a place on the European Tour, where his game continued to grow, with nine top-10 finishes across 2013 and 14. He won his final 2014 start, and then won twice early in 2015.With two top-5 finishes in last years majors, Grace secured a PGA Tour card and has dedicated himself to a full rookie season in the United States. He has chosen South Florida as his base, not far from Oosthuizen, Schwartzel and Els.Graces first stop after winning at Hilton Head was at Elss home for a late-night celebration.He says, Call me, you call him, Grace quipped. It was good. Very relaxed, just him and his family, myself and my fiance and a couple of mates.Grace followed that victory with another top-10 the following week in San Antonio, but struggled at the Players Championship, finishing with a share of 57th. A lengthy break followed, but hell be rested for the Open challenge.Oakmont will be Graces fourth U.S. Open, with his other finishes a tie for 51st in 2012 and missing the cut one year later at Merion.I was kind of in the back of my mind putting a little bit of pressure on myself, Grace said of his recent transformation. Now I can really sit back  not really relax, but enjoy it a little more."}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that he would take our campaign for transforming the Democratic Party into the convention, refusing to concede the presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton though not explicitly saying he would challenge her for it.Mrs. Clinton earned enough delegates to clinch the nomination last week, but Mr. Sanders has declined to end his campaign. He has contended that he could persuade enough superdelegates, the party leaders who have overwhelmingly backed Mrs. Clinton, to switch their support to him by arguing that he would be the stronger candidate against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.That plan became more improbable last week as high-profile Democrats supported Mrs. Clinton. President Obama endorsed her on Thursday, calling her the most qualified candidate ever to seek the White House and imploring Democrats to unite behind her. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, told CNN on Friday that he now supports Mrs. Clinton.In recent days, Mr. Sanders appeared to acknowledge the odds against him, and began speaking less about beating Mrs. Clinton and more about working to defeat Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.On Sunday, he gathered with about 20 key supporters and advisers at his home in Burlington, Vt., to discuss how to proceed.We are going to take our campaign to the convention with the full understanding that we are very good at arithmetic and that we know, you know, who has the received the most votes up to now, Mr. Sanders said after the meeting, standing on his front lawn with his wife, Jane. Among the dozen or so people who attended the gathering were Benjamin T. Jealous, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P.; Congressman Ral M. Grijalva of Arizona; Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator; and Bill McKibben, the environmentalist and author.Notably, Mr. Sanders also said he would continue his efforts aimed at transforming the Democratic Party, a sign that his main goal may no longer be to become the nominee.Besides defeating Mr. Trump, advisers say his focus is to get his ideas, like universal health care and free public college, reflected in the party platform. Refusing to concede and release his delegates to vote for Mrs. Clinton could be a negotiating tactic for winning concessions on the platform. If his delegates tried to nominate Mr. Sanders from the floor of the convention next month, the scene could damage Mrs. Clinton at a time she is trying to project strength and party unity.In recent days, it had been unclear whether Mr. Sanders intended to stay in the race, and even on Sunday he did not rule out the possibility that he would formally concede the nomination in the coming days.After he met with Mr. Obama on Thursday he said he looked forward to exploring how he could work with Mrs. Clinton to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent. Then he held a rally that night in Washington urging voters to cast ballots for him on Tuesday in the nations final primary.When asked by Chuck Todd on Sundays Meet the Press on NBC whether he was an active candidate, he responded that he wanted to see Mr. Trump defeated.Mr. Sanders said that he and Mrs. Clinton planned to meet on Tuesday and that he would ask her whether she will be vigorous in standing up for working families in the middle class, moving aggressively in climate change, health care for all, making public colleges and universities tuition-free.And after we have that kind of discussion and after we can determine whether or not we are going to have a strong and progressive platform, he said, I will be able to make other decisions.There have been signs that he was winding down his run. While Mrs. Clinton has been hiring campaign workers, Mr. Sanders started laying off at least half of his campaign staff members last week. He has let go of a number of advance staff members who help with campaign logistics, as well as field workers who have been canvassing for votes.According to a person who attended the meeting at Mr. Sanderss home Sunday, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private gathering, there was no talk from Mr. Sanders about trying to win the nomination. The group was keenly interested in how the senators meeting with Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday will turn out, and whether he would get assurances that she would fight for his ideas, this person said.While he is effectively no longer a threat, Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats are counting on Mr. Sanders to eventually get behind her candidacy. He has a loyal base of more than 10 million voters and an enormous donor list that Mrs. Clinton will want to tap into. Some of his supporters say they will not vote for anyone but Mr. Sanders, so Mrs. Clintons success may depend on how vocally the senator supports her."}
{"text": "George V. Voinovich, a former two-term United States senator and two-term governor of Ohio who preached frugality in his personal and public life and occasionally bucked the Republican establishment, died on Sunday at his home in Cleveland. He was 79.His death was confirmed by his wife, Janet, who did not give a cause.Mr. Voinovich had a pacemaker installed in 2003 because his heart rate had slowed down over several years as a result of a condition called progressive sinus bradycardia, and he had experienced other health problems in recent years. But his death came as a surprise to friends.He had spoken on Friday at a Slovenian Independence Day event in Cleveland. He was to be a delegate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next month.During his 12 years in the Senate, Mr. Voinovich occasionally found himself at odds with his more conservative fellow Republicans. A moderate who opposed the size of President George W. Bushs tax cuts and later questioned Mr. Bushs war strategy in Iraq, he was also an early supporter of a proposed federal bailout for the auto industry, which employs thousands of people in Ohio, and one of the few Republicans during the Bush administration to suggest raising taxes to pay for the war in Iraq and hurricane relief.Mr. Voinovich cultivated an image as a proponent of fiscal discipline. He opposed President Obamas $787 billion economic stimulus package, saying it was weighed down by too much spending that was not stimulative.He also prided himself on his own frugality. He shined his own shoes, bought his clothes on sale and as governor banned peanuts and other snacks on state airplanes to save public money.Mr. Voinovich announced in 2009 that he would not run for a third term. He was succeeded by a fellow Republican, Rob Portman.In his farewell speech, Mr. Voinovich urged his colleagues to tackle a fiscal situation he said was on life support. He said he did not agree with legislation to prevent an income tax increase, but he complimented President Obama and legislative leaders for working out a compromise.In 2009, Mr. Voinovich was among those who unsuccessfully campaigned against an Ohio ballot issue that paved the way for the building of casinos in Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Toledo. In 2011, after leaving the Senate, he lent his support to a bill that would outlaw abortions at the first detectable fetal heartbeat.As governor in the 1990s, Mr. Voinovich vowed to streamline state government. He began programs to roll back environmental regulations and struck long-term contract deals with state employee unions, promising security but little money.He also cut $720 million from the state budget in two years. But in 1993, Mr. Voinovich and leaders of both parties in the Legislature pushed a tax increase to shore up the states finances. The move angered some conservatives, who began questioning his commitment to their cause.In 1979, while Mr. Voinovich was running for mayor, his 9-year-old daughter, Molly, was killed when she was hit by a van that went through a red light. When one loses a child, he said at the time, things come into focus, what is important, what is unimportant.She was the youngest of four children born to Mr. Voinovich and his wife. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.Mr. Voinovich was a prized commodity in the Ohio G.O.P.: a Republican who could deliver Cleveland, a Democratic stronghold.Though he was one of Ohios most popular Republican politicians, he stumbled in 1988 during his first bid for the United States Senate. Trailing badly in the polls, he attacked the grandfatherly Democratic incumbent, Howard Metzenbaum, for not being tough on child pornography. The move backfired, and Mr. Metzenbaum soundly carried the election.In a statement, former President George H.W. Bush praised Mr. Voinovich as a quintessential public servant who brought people together, focused on results and left his state and our country a better place.George Victor Voinovich was born on July 15, 1936, in Cleveland. He was the oldest of six children of George and Josephine Voinovich. His fathers heritage was Serbian, his mothers Slovenian; his grandparents had immigrated to the United States from what is now Croatia.He served in the Ohio House from 1967 to 1971.By the late 1970s, Cleveland was in default and most people blamed the Democratic mayor, Dennis Kucinich, who constantly fought electric utilities, the citys banking community and other big-business interests.Mr. Voinovich defeated Mr. Kucinich, who later became a congressman, and went on to serve a decade as mayor. He was credited by members of both parties with turning the city around.In 1990, he easily defeated Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., another Clevelander, and began the first of two four-year terms as governor."}

{"text": "It is the first thing you learn in peewee soccer: Dont touch the ball with your hand.Peru broke the cardinal rule on Sunday night but got away with it, and mighty Brazil was eliminated from the Copa Amrica in the group stage.Brazil needed only a draw in their game in Foxborough, Mass., to advance, and that looked extraordinarily likely: It had not lost a competitive game to Peru since 1985.But with the game scoreless in the 75th minute, Andy Polo of Peru crossed the ball to Ral Ruidaz in front of the net, and Ruidaz batted it in with his arm.The replays were unambiguous, but after a four-minute discussion involving the referee, his assistants and a headset, the goal stood. Despite several good chances, Brazil could not tie the score and was eliminated.Brazil had 66 percent possession, outshot Peru by 14-4, had 10 corner kicks to Perus two and outpassed Peru by 593-320.Dunga, the embattled Brazil manager, said after the game, The fans saw how Brazil was eliminated; the goal was scored with his hand, The Associated Press reported. But asked if he feared dismissal, he replied, I only fear death.It was an impressive accomplishment for Peru. Polo and Ruidaz are among the 17 players on the 23-man team who play in the unheralded Peruvian league while Brazil is packed with players from the best teams in Europe.Peru stands just eighth among 10 South American teams in World Cup qualifying and has not played in the World Cup since 1982. Yet it has punched above its weight recently in the Copa, finishing third in each of the last two events. Still, those performances did not involve a marquee victory over a team like Brazil.The surprise result, combined with Ecuadors 4-0 win over Haiti, means that the United States, which before the tournament might have expected a quarterfinal game against Brazil, will instead face Ecuador, potentially a much easier opponent, on Thursday in Seattle.Brazil was last eliminated in the group stage of the Copa in 1987, when only four teams made the knockout round and Brazil was second in a three-team group. In the 11 Copas since, Brazil has made 11 knockout-round appearances and won the event five times.It is not a golden age for Brazilian soccer. Playing at home, the team was favored to win the World Cup in 2014, only to be embarrassed in the semifinals by Germany, 7-1. In World Cup qualifying, Brazil unusually stands in sixth place in South America with six of 18 games played.The history of the hand ball is as old as the history of soccer itself. Probably the most famous one came in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup, when Diego Maradona flagrantly fisted the ball into the net in a 2-1 Argentina victory over England. He later credited the goal to the hand of God.In a World Cup playoff game in 2009, Thierry Henry handled the ball in the box before kicking it to William Gallas for a goal that sent France on to the tournament and eliminated Ireland. The referee missed that one, too.In a 2010 World Cup quarterfinal, Luis Surez used his hand to save what would have been a winning goal by Ghana. This time the infraction was caught, Surez was ejected, and Ghana was awarded a penalty kick. But Asamoah Gyan missed it, and Uruguay won the game in a penalty shootout, keeping Ghana from becoming the first African team to reach the semifinals.Surez was unrepentant to say the least.

Germany rightly owned up to the Holocaust and is a better country for it. Turkey can do the same with respect to the Armenian genocide.Bryan Ardouny, WashingtonThe writer is the executive director of the Armenian Assembly of America.To the Editor:Yes, its genocide begs the question: Where is the comparison? Yes, the Germans have confronted the genocide in their own history. They had to. There were the Nuremberg Trials that proved that a genocide did indeed occur.There has been no such occasion for Turkey. The Malta Trials, set up by the British after World War I, failed to resolve the issue. Having tried to obtain proof that the Turks had intentionally tried to exterminate their Armenian citizens, the British, and the other Allies that they consulted, including the United States, gave up trying to convict the accused Turks. The detained government officials and prominent writers, numbering 144, were sent back to Turkey, in exchange for 22 British prisoners.No, as yet, there is no comparison. Instead, let the Armenians and their friends take the case to an International Court of Justice. The German Bundestag, or any other governmental body, and the media have no right to accuse the Turks of genocide without giving them their day in court.Erkin Baker, Alton, Ill.To the Editor:I commend you for your editorial strongly supporting the German Parliaments decision to pass a resolution calling Turkeys massacre of 1.5 million Armenians a genocide. And if Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the increasingly autocratic president of Turkey (who is bordering on becoming a dictator), thinks that he can threaten and bully Germany with damaging bilateral diplomatic, economic, trade, political and military ties, lets remind him that Turkey needs Germany more than Germany needs Turkey.Ultimately, if Mr. Erdogan follows up with his threats the only thing he would achieve would amount to shooting himself in the foot and further damaging his countrys continually aggressive behavior.Michael Hadjiargyrou, Old Westbury, N.Y."}
{"text": "The memories were set aside a long time ago, Dustin Johnson insists. No waking up in a cold sweat over that gasp-inducing trio of putts 50 weeks ago on the baked-out final green at Chambers Bay that cost him the United States Open title, which would have been his first victory in a major.If anything, hes annoyed at the notion that anyone would think his poor finish might have lingering effects nearly a year later.I dont know if anyones aware of it, but Ive played 20 freaking tournaments since Chambers Bay, Johnson said on CBS television after a round last week. Its not that Ill be O.K. I am O.K.And in looking at the big picture, he is. Johnsons third-place finish at the Memorial Tournament on June 5 was his 15th top-10 place in his past 30 starts worldwide. It also moved the South Carolina native up to No.6 in the world rankings.Johnson, 31, has victories in each of his previous eight PGA Tour seasons going back to his rookie year, the longest streak among active players on the circuit.That streak, though, begins to look a little worn as another U.S. Open approaches, beginning Thursday at Oakmont Country Club outside Pittsburgh.The last time Johnson added to his trophy collection was in March 2015, at the World Golf Championships event at Doral in Miami. Although the Chambers Bay disaster itself may not be a burden, it may be part of a larger malaise.Ive felt like Im playing well, Johnson said. I just havent quite played up to my potential.If potential had a greater influence on golf, Johnson might be on his way to the games Hall of Fame. Theres still plenty of time for that, of course. With his lanky build, languid swing and natural athleticism, Johnson is among the first golfers cited by fellow pros when asked who has the most natural gifts.Dustin Johnson is arguably the most talented player on the PGA Tour, said Jordan Spieth, the U.S. Open winner last year. I think hes not only a freak athlete, but a freak golf athlete. He has great hands, great clubface control. He hits some shots you wont see anybody else trying.Johnson averages nearly 310 yards per drive, so its no surprise he is among the PGA Tours top dozen in making birdies on par-5 holes. He ranks equally well in making birdie on par-4s and par-3s.I feel like my golf game in total has been solid and consistent, he said. Every week I feel like Im up there and Ive got a chance to win.The mystery, then, is why he hasnt.The technical answer is that Johnsons short game remains inconsistent. He saves par from a greenside bunker less than half the time, and his putting can run extremely hot and cold.I feel like Im burning the edges all the time, he said. Its not like I feel like Im hitting bad putts, its just barely off.Nonetheless, that could spell trouble on Oakmonts wickedly fast greens.The less technical answer to Johnsons dry spell, of course, is that the long haul of weekends has become a stumbling block.His physical attributes are wonderful, said Notah Begay III, a Golf Channel analyst. I think just maintaining the level of focus that a player needs to maintain for 72 holes  round-in, round-out  he has a tendency to lose focus. Sometimes its a couple of holes, sometimes its three or four, and it costs him.Johnsons Sunday shortcomings at majors are well chronicled: the three-shot lead heading to the final round of the 2010 U.S. Open that was gone within two holes; the bunker-rules gaffe that kept him out of a P.G.A. Championship playoff two months later; his pursuit of Darren Clarke at the 2011 British Open that ended with an out-of-bounds 2-iron on No.14 at Royal St. Georges in Sandwich, England; and the sting of that final hole at Chambers Bay.Needing an eagle to win or a birdie to tie Spieth and send the U.S. Open to a Monday playoff, Johnson found himself staring at an eagle chance after his approach came to rest 12 feet from the flag.That putt didnt fall, nor did the 4-foot follow-up. That meant the title was Spieths, and both he and Johnson were left with looks of disbelief.I felt like I did what I was supposed to do in that situation, Johnson recalled. It wasnt really anything to be upset about or to be down on.I hit the shots I needed to hit in the situation and in that moment, he added. It was unfortunate the surfaces of those greens werent as smooth as they should have been, but it is what it is.In reply to questions about how long that sting would linger, Johnson went out a few weeks later and blistered St. Andrews in Scotland with a 65 on the first day of the British Open Championship. A subsequent 69 in a wind-whipped second round left him with the 36-hole lead, but he then shot 75-75 over the final two days.He also led after the P.G.A. Championships opening round at Whistling Straits, only to follow with a 73 as Jason Day and Spieth began to pull away.There is a similar pattern in regular events this season. Johnson ranks among the PGA Tours top two in both first- and second-round scoring average, but he is outside the top 50 for the third-round average and doesnt crack the top 100 for the final round.In Johnsons five top-5 finishes this year, including a tie for fourth at the Masters, he has not turned in a final round lower than 69.Its the pressure we all put on ourselves, said the Australian veteran Rod Pampling, who was paired with Johnson for two days at Memorial. A little pressure here and there, and it changes a lot of things.Only Johnson can change his current trends. Although Oakmont might seem an unlikely venue for a shift, Johnson is too gifted to be ruled out."}
{"text": "It was hard during Saturdays Belmont Stakes not to think about American Pharoah, the colt who a year ago delivered a historic performance at the race in becoming just the 12th Triple Crown winner ever and horse racings first in 37 years.When the jockey Victor Espinoza and American Pharoah turned for home, they transformed this grand old racetrack on Long Island into a soul-quaking monument to pandemonium. The colt had pulled into Belmont Park promising greatness, and over the mile-and-a-half marathon fittingly known as the Test of the Champion, he delivered it. His five-and-a-half-length victory was simply a masterpiece.American Pharoah had packed the place. He made the $11 beers that the New York Racing Association was selling taste like Dom Prignon at Pabst Blue Ribbon prices. He sent strangers into one anothers arms.That is worth remembering because odds are that it will be an equally long time before we see another horse with enough talent and magic to sweep the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.We were reminded of  no, bludgeoned with  that likelihood over the last five weeks as the owners and trainers of the current crop of 3-year-olds measured their horses against American Pharoah and Triple Crown history.On paper at least, the most formidable challenger was Nyquist. He rolled into the first Saturday in May as the reigning 2-year-old champion and was undefeated over seven races. He easily won the Kentucky Derby and had a rsum far more impressive than American Pharoahs at that point in his career.Nyquist was missing something, however. He is a smallish colt who, while consistently doing enough to win, never gave anyone the sense that he was a dominant competitor. He did not possess the wow factor that American Pharoah had.Even as a weanling  a mere child, called the Littleprincessemma colt after his mother  American Pharoah took away the breath of Frances Rellihan, a seasoned horsewoman who had had her hands on thousands of colts over her career but to that point had never seen one so perfectly engineered, with an intricate mind to match his physical gifts. It was a combination that bowled over seasoned horse people at every point of American Pharoahs development and still makes his Hall of Fame trainer, Bob Baffert, wish he had him for one, two, six more races.I never got to the bottom of him, Baffert said. He was still getting better.Nyquist, on the other hand, although recognized as a nice horse in his formative years, was treated as a commodity rather than a gift from the heavens. He was sold three times before reaching the racetrack, finally fetching a modest $400,000 in a 2-year-old-in-training sale in Florida.Luck and magic took their turn along American Pharoahs career.Early on, his owner, Ahmed Zayat, tried to sell the colt, needing cash to help settle his stables bankruptcy. Lucky for him, the colt banged his ankle in the days before a yearling sale at Saratoga. Zayat had thought he might get millions in the auction ring; instead, no one wanted the modestly bred colt with the unsightly leg.Magic was bestowed on American Pharoah when Espinoza got on his back. He was not the first choice to ride the colt, nor was he the second or third. Martin Garcia had ridden American Pharoah in his debut, a loss, and did not get along with him. Baffert had hoped to get Gary Stevens or Mike Smith, two Hall of Famers, but they were not available. He settled on Espinoza, whose happy-go-lucky nature and intuitive riding style fit American Pharoah perfectly.For Nyquist, however, bad luck and black magic landed on him like an anvil in the Preakness. A wet week in Baltimore and a misty, rainy race day served up a soupy track at Pimlico Race Course, one that he had never seen before.His chief rival, Exaggerator, was a proven mudder and took to the surface, which gripped hooves like peanut butter gliding over a sandwich. He emphatically dispatched Nyquist, who developed a fever in the days afterward, persuading his connections to skip the Belmont and let the colt catch his breath for a second-season campaign into the Breeders Cup Classic.Exaggerator, a hard-trying colt, was out of gas in the Belmont Stakes. He is somewhere between a nice horse and a very good one but looked like neither in finishing 11th.So the 148th running of Belmont Stakes turned into an entertaining race without a great deal of consequence. Instead of American Pharoahs historic stretch drive with a capacity crowd on hand to witness, about half as many people cheered on three gray horses, all of them long shots, as they raced home in a photo finish. Creator had a nose ahead of Destin, and Lani finished third behind them.Those who had the three on their betting tickets left Belmont Park with more money than they came with and a smile on their faces. Congratulations to them. It is one of the most rewarding parts of a good day at the racetrack.Last year, though, while American Pharoah sent some people home with less dough, he pushed all of us out of the racetrack with a priceless feeling of elation.Great horses do that, and they are rare. So appreciate what American Pharoah accomplished, and be patient until another comes along."}
{"text": "The attempts by Republican lawmakers to suppress the turnout of Democratic-leaning voters in the 2016 election have reached shameless levels in Ohio  a swing state where it turns out that even homeless citizens have been blocked from exercising their right to vote.Thanks to a timely ruling last week from a federal district judge, Algenon Marbley, the obstacles to minorities at the polling booth come November may be less formidable than they might have been, though the state plans to appeal and problems remain. The judge struck down a 2014 Republican-sponsored state law that, among other things, required that absentee ballots be thrown out for essentially trivial mistakes. This, the judge ruled, discriminated against minority voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act, including homeless people disqualified for not providing precise addresses.Other changes in the 2014 law shortened the period during which voters could correct such errors and barred election clerks from helping someone confused by the forms, unless the voter was physically disabled.Judge Marbley said the law constituted a retreat from improvements in voting procedures enacted in 2004 and called it part of a disturbing flurry of voting rights limitations enacted by the Republican Legislature and Gov. John Kasich in recent years, which sought to limit the precious right to the franchise in some manner.Last month, a different federal judge ruled unconstitutional another Ohio law that cut back early voting opportunities for citizens. Furious statehouse Republicans have denied any scheme to suppress Democratic voters, and Ohios secretary of state, Jon Husted, arguing that the decisions will produce chaos, said the state will appeal.But Judge Marbley saw an unmistakably clear and politically motivated pattern of suppression. The Republican-controlled General Assemblys frenetic pace of introducing such legislation reflects questionable motives, given the wealth of other problems facing the state which actually needed solutions, he declared.The ruling noted that the Voting Rights Act specifically forbids using paper errors and omissions to bar an otherwise qualified voter from casting a ballot, which is effectively a literacy test. Advocates for the homeless and Democratic officials who brought the lawsuit estimated that thousands of otherwise qualified voters had already been blocked and more would be in the November election.It is already clear that voter suppression engineered in Republican-controlled statehouses will be a sorry part of the election dynamic this year. Ordinary citizens deserve better than such cynical gamesmanship, particularly from professional politicians who should be the most conscientious of all in protecting the right to vote. Ohio voters should see these laws as an invitation to use this falls ballot to reject lawmakers who so callously undermine democracy."}
{"text": "I remember my therapists advice when I was a 22-year-old, not yet out-of-the-closet gay man living in Washington  uncertain, unhappy, unready.She knew that I wasnt prepared to walk into a gay club  wasnt prepared to acknowledge what that meant  so she recommended a kind of emotional compromise: Go into one, walk around and then leave. Test the waters. See how it feels.I did. It worked. It usually does, doesnt it?To fully grasp the unique horror of what happened inside Pulse  a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that became the site of the worst mass shooting in America  you have to understand the outsize role that gay bars play in the history, lives and imagination of gay people.They are refuges and havens, places where, the moment you cross the threshold, there is an unspoken understanding: You will feel accepted and safe.In Orlando, that concept was perverted and upended in the most brutal way imaginable. The safe harbor became a bloody death chamber.It was a gay bar that had liberated me and so many of my peers, once we finally summoned the courage to stick around and take a seat, putting us on a long path toward self-acceptance.Will that change now?Murderous attacks on gay establishments are not new, of course. Arson at a gay lounge in New Orleans in 1973 killed 32 people, a number that was surpassed on Sunday in Orlando. Smaller-scale attacks have occurred at bars across the country.They are shocks, every time, precisely because these spaces exist to shelter their inhabitants from the slights and sallies of the world.It is no accident that a major turning point in the modern gay-rights movement took place at a gay bar. The Stonewall Inn, in Manhattans West Village, was a refuge in a city where bars frequently refused to welcome gay men, lesbians and transgender patrons. When the police raided it in 1969, the gay community rebelled. This was their sanctuary.On Sunday night, in front of the Stonewall Inn, I met a 52-year-old gay activist, David Drake. Older and wiser than me (Im now 36), he described the outrage he felt about the Orlando gunmans decision to carry out his massacre at a gay nightclub. His frame of reference was telling.Its like when the gunman goes into a church and shoots people, he said. This is completely wrong.Its sacred, he said of the bar behind him, draped in rainbow-colored flags. These spaces, even though they are quote-unquote bars or clubs, are those spaces for people in the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Those are the spaces we come to.He spoke of the thousands of young gay, bisexual and transgender people who flock to bars and clubs in the West Village: Night after night after night, these kids come down here because they feel like its their safe space. The queer kids from various colors, various communities come here because its their space. They can be who they want, they can be who they are to themselves and each other, to reflect each other, to know each other, to love each other, to discover each other, to grow with each other, in order to become grown-up people.The gunman who killed 49 people inside Pulse may have wanted to rob gay bars of that hard-fought role, but he did not. He could not."}
{"text": "Hollywood had a mixed weekend at the box office. The Conjuring 2 was strong. Warcraft was soft. Now You See Me 2 was a shrug.Beating this summers sequel curse, the well-reviewed Conjuring 2 was the No. 1 draw at North American multiplexes between Friday and Sunday, taking in about $40.4 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The first Conjuring arrived to $41.9 million in opening-weekend ticket sales. On the downside, New Line and its financing partners spent about $42 million to make the sequel, double the production cost of the original.The poorly reviewed Warcraft was second, taking in about $24.4 million. That is a dismal start for a film that cost at least $160 million to make, but Warcraft, from Legendary Entertainment, has been doing surprisingly well overseas, where it has taken in roughly $261.7 million so far. The video-game adaptation notably received one of the largest releases ever in China; Legendary was purchased by Chinas Dalian Wanda Group in January.Lionsgate had hoped that Now You See Me 2 would officially end a box-office cold streak, but the studio instead had to make do with a ho-hum $23 million in opening-weekend ticket sales for its magic-themed sequel, or 22 percent less than initial results for the original film. Lionsgate spent roughly $90 million on the sequel; the first movie cost $75 million."}
{"text": "It started in 2010 when I smoked pot for the first time since college. It was cheap, gristly weed Id had in my freezer for nearly six years, but four hours after taking one hit I was still so dizzy I couldnt stand up without holding on to the furniture. The next day I was still dizzy, and the next, and the next, but it tapered off gradually until about a month later I was mostly fine.Over the following year I got married, started teaching seventh and eighth grade, and began work on a novel. Every week or so the disequilibrium sneaked up on me. The feeling was one of disorientation as much as dizziness, with some cloudy vision, light nausea and the sensation of being overwhelmed by my surroundings. During one eighth-grade English class, when I turned around to write on the blackboard, I stumbled and couldnt stabilize myself. I fell in front of my students and was too disoriented to stand. My students stared at me slumped on the floor until I mustered enough focus to climb up to a chair and did my best to laugh it off.I was only 29, but my father had had a benign brain tumor around the same age, so I had a brain scan. My brain appeared to be fine. A neurologist recommended I see an ear, nose and throat specialist. A technician flooded my ear canal with water to see if my acoustic nerve reacted properly. The doctor suspected either benign positional vertigo (dizziness caused by a small piece of bonelike calcium stuck in the inner ear) or Mnires disease (which leads to dizziness from pressure).Unfortunately, the test showed my inner ear was most likely fine. But just as the marijuana had triggered the dizziness the year before, the test itself catalyzed the dizziness now. In spite of the negative results, doctors still believed I had an inner ear problem. They prescribed exercises to unblock crystals, and salt pills and then prednisone to fight Mnires disease.All this took months, and I continued to be dizzy, all day, every day. It felt as though I woke up every morning having already drunk a dozen beers  some days, depending on how active and stressful my day was, it felt like much more. Most days ended with me in tears. Teaching was nearly impossible; I was unable to write because of blurry vision, and my wife became a caretaker more than a partner; I became addicted to message boards for dizziness, vertigo, benign positional vertigo and Mnires disease. Anonymous posters described how their medications didnt work and their doctors couldnt cure them. They couldnt keep their jobs; their friends didnt understand them; and their spouses left or tried to be supportive, but eventually both suffered.Finally, my doctor recommended a new neurologist who performed some simple tests and casually gave me a diagnosis of vestibular migraines, a condition that didnt exist in medical journals 20 years ago.Apparently, instead of causing severe pain, my migraines manifest as constant dizziness. I began taking Klonopin daily. It immediately mitigated the symptoms, but Klonopin can be addictive. My eyes started to twitch after a few weeks on it, so my doctor looked for another option. After living for two years with incessant dizziness, I settled on a combination of Lexapro and Serzone, both antidepressants, that began to work. In 2013, I could teach and began to write my novel again. I could enjoy life with my wife. We had our first son. I was free.But there was a downside. A known side effect of the treatment is nightmares. Night after night, I woke up from a tortured dream during which I fought someone off from attacking my wife and baby, or suffered the devastation of them leaving me. I couldnt sleep for more than a few hours at a time (and still cant), and neither could my family. Still, compared to the dizziness, it was a trade worth making. I was tired but still able to finish and sell my novel and to teach, and we had our second son.After nearly three years of being symptom free, I became greedy. Was there a way to live without the dizziness and the nightmares? I thought it might be worth cutting down on the medication to see. In January, I went to half the amount of medication, and I was fine. So I went to a quarter of the amount, and I was fine. So I went off it entirely.The dizziness came back more viciously than ever. This wasnt troubling at first; I merely went back on the antidepressants. When they didnt work after a couple weeks, I grew anxious. But my doctor told me that sometimes the drugs take as long as a month to work. When they were still ineffective after two months, I began to despair. A neurologist explained that sometimes medication doesnt work a second time  sometimes brain chemistries change, or medications stop proving effective for reasons doctors dont understand.So now, we are searching again. It has been five months of dizziness. I am 35 now, doing my best to fight my way through parenting, teaching and working on my book. I am relying on my wife. My neurologist has started me on verapamil, a blood pressure medication, which has been shown to be effective for some migraine sufferers, but is not working for me.I am pretending for as long as I can, at least in front of my 3-year-old. Daddy no feel so good? he says when I brace myself on a chair on my way to the kitchen to reheat his dinner. Ive begun to see a psychologist who specializes in pain and palliative care to provide techniques to help me get through the day. I am waiting, terrified, to see if this medication, or the next one, will rescue me.Brian Platzer (@BPlatzer) has written for New Republic, Salon and other publications.

{"text": "The rookie right-hander Michael Fulmer, a former Mets prospect who was sent to the Tigers system last season as part of a trade for Yoenis Cespedes, dominated the crosstown Yankees Sunday in Detroits 4-1 victory at Yankee Stadium.Fulmer, 23, has been sharp recently, and on Sunday he gave up no runs, three walks and two hits over six innings, extending his scoreless innings streak to 28 and his winning streak to five games. His scoreless innings streak is the second-longest by a Tigers rookie in franchise history, behind John Hillers 28 innings in 1967.According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Fulmer is also the only pitcher since 1893 to record four straight starts in a single season with at least six shutout innings while also allowing no more than three hits.Fulmer improved to 7-1 and lowered his E.R.A. to 2.52 in 53 innings for the season. He seems to be enjoying his success.Its always fun to win, Fulmer said.Fulmer was not upset when the Mets traded him last year; it was nice to be wanted, he said. He added that he enjoyed seeing the success of the Mets major league pitchers while he was in the Mets minor league system  including success among some of his former teammates.It was awesome to see guys like that succeed and get to live their dream, Fulmer said. I knew if I kept at it and pitched the way I could, then my time would come. Whether it was with the Mets or this Tigers team.Now, Fulmer is making his own mark. He said the biggest factor in his recent success was just getting outs when he needed to.If a guy gets on, I try not to panic, Fulmer said. I just try to locate my pitches and get good action on my pitches. He then lets the defense do its work, he added, and they usually come up pretty big.The Yankees tried to put something together against Fulmer in the fifth inning Sunday. Austin Romine led off with a ground-rule double to right field. Two outs later, Fulmer walked Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner to load the bases. Carlos Beltran popped up to end the inning, however, and Fulmers scoreless streak continued.Afterward, Beltran praised Fulmers fastball and slider.For me, especially, I was having trouble picking up the spin on the slider, Beltran said after the game. He got me chasing a couple of times.The loss pulled the Yankees to one game under .500, at 31-32. They finished their seven-game homestand at 5-2 after succumbing to the strong pitching performances of Fulmer on Sunday and Justin Verlander on Saturday.Michael Pineda went six innings for the Yankees, striking out eight and allowing six hits and two runs. He got into trouble in the fourth and fifth innings but was able to limit the damage. After Pineda yielded three straight singles at the opening of the fourth, Nick Castellanoss sacrifice fly scored Miguel Cabrera from third, giving the Tigers a 1-0 lead. But after another single by Justin Upton, Pineda got Jarrod Saltalamacchia to line out and struck out Mike Aviles swinging.Pineda gave up one more run in the fifth. With two on and one out, Victor Martinezs groundout toward first was enough for Ian Kinsler, who had walked to lead off the inning, to score from third base and build the Tigers lead to 2-0.In the sixth, Pineda, whose record fell to 3-7, retired the side in order, striking out Upton and Saltalamacchia.My slider the last couple of starts is good, Pineda said. Its way better than the first couple of months. Im more consistent with my slider, and my fastball location too.Yankees reliever Anthony Swarzak came on to start the seventh, giving up a leadoff single to Mike Aviles. Kinsler followed with a two-run home run to left field, making Detroits lead 4-0. Kinsler had also homered on Saturday.The Yankees scored their only run in the eighth when Chase Headley singled, driving Ellsbury in from second. But it was not enough.After a stretch of 40 games in 41 days, the Yankees will have Monday off before beginning a two-game series against the Rockies at Coors Field on Tuesday."}

Sales of Apples biggest product, the iPhone, are slowing, and there has been little in recent months to excite consumers. The company is likely to show off a new version of Apple Music, its streaming music subscription service, and new photo-editing features.Apple is also trying to improve its sometimes testy relationship with developers. One big announcement geared to that crowd: Developers will be able to use Siri, the companys voice-activated digital assistant, within their apps. Developers are also expecting the company to finally offer Apple Pay to online retailers as a checkout method for their websites. The digital payment service is currently restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response. But the ability to pay on the web with a thumbprint would be more convenient, which could drive wider use.

In its lawsuit, the Libyan fund claims that the transactions were rendered worthless during the financial crisis, but Goldman still earned $350 million in profit on the transactions. Chad BrayTECHNOLOGYThe Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, video game convention in Los Angeles is usually the most cacophonous of trade shows, where lots of earsplitting new games debut. But the event that begins on Tuesday will be a little less deafening than normal. Major game publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts have decided not to exhibit on the show floor this year; instead, Electronic Arts held its own expo nearby on Sunday. Nintendo has already told fans not to expect to see its next-generation game console, code-named NX, at E3. Still, Sony and Microsoft are likely to get gamers buzzing on Monday when they hold events showcasing the games coming to their consoles. Analysts are also expecting the companies to announce updated versions of their existing consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nick WingfieldRETAIL INDUSTRYRetail sales data for the United States, due on Tuesday, is expected to show a rise in consumer spending for May. Still, it probably will not be as robust as that in April, when spending rose to the highest levels in more than a year. Rachel AbramsMARKETSFinancial policy makers in China will be hoping their languid stock markets get a vote of confidence on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in New York), when a decision on whether to include domestic Chinese shares in a major global stock index is to be announced. The MSCI emerging markets index, a benchmark tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars in investment funds around the world, is set to announce the results of an annual review on whether to include stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the first time. Even though it is the worlds second-biggest by market value, Chinas domestic share market remains only partly open to foreign investors, and values have remained depressed since the government bungled a stock bailout attempt last summer. Neil GoughECONOMYFederal Reserve officials drained much of the drama from their scheduled meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday by making clear in recent days they were once again postponing any increase in the Feds benchmark interest rate. But there still will be substance: In addition to the post-meeting policy statement, the Fed will release a fresh batch of economic projections, and the Feds chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. The looming question is whether the Fed will raise rates this summer. The Feds next scheduled meetings are in July and September. Fed officials are likely to debate whether the recent slowdown in job growth indicates that their mission of restoring the health of the labor market is largely accomplished, or a more worrisome sign of fresh economic weakness. Binyamin AppelbaumOn Wednesday, at 9:15 a.m., the Federal Reserve will report data for industrial production in May. After industrial production rose 0.7 percent in April, economists are expecting to see a slight decline for last month, with the sector facing headwinds from depressed mining and drilling, lagging overseas demand for manufactured goods and adverse weather in some parts of the United States. Nelson D. SchwartzOn Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on consumer prices in May. Economists are expecting to see a 0.3 percent increase in overall consumer prices, with a 0.2 percent rise in the less volatile core Consumer Price Index. Inflation remains tame, with a likely increase in May driven, in part, by higher gasoline prices. Nelson D. Schwartz"}

Our most recent suggestions also appear below. To receive our guide straight to your inbox, sign up here.Last nights Tonys were just a delight. In addition to of course activating my Hamilton pleasure receptors, the show included both a knockout opening number and my most favorite thing of all: Winners who have clearly prepared acceptance speeches. I cried the entire time. Plus the cast of The Humans took its Tony on the subway!Were trying another new format in todays newsletter, and Id love to hear how you like it: Do you prefer the shows broken down by time commitment? By day of the week? By general vibe? Or some other way? Id also love to hear if youve named a pet after a favorite TV character. No particular reason, I just like pets. Team Watching and I eagerly await your responses: watching@nytimes.com.Spartan: Ultimate Team Challenge (Monday, 10 p.m., NBC)Watch if you like American Ninja Warrior, or fitness contest shows in general.I still cant believe NBC couldnt make that American Gladiators reboot work a few years ago, because apparently our societys appetite for absurd competitive feats of strength has only grown. Heres Spartan, as in the company that stages obstacle course races for the ostentatiously athletic, joining several very similar series. Its pretty good, if youre looking for viewing where ordinary (if very fit) citizens throw spears, lift logs, slither through mud, etc.Shows like this work best when they depict the competition and become unbearable when theyre just talking-head confessionals, contrived spiels and schlocky backstories that scam us into caring. Spartan is on the correct side of this divide, focusing the vast majority of its energy on the grueling physical processes and very little on the frankly worthless we can all live our dreams! sidebars.Also this week on broadcast:BrainDead, from the creators of The Good Wife, is a zombie show (sort of) and a political show. (Read The New York Times review here.) The first episode cant quite figure itself out, and if you have any aversion to creepy-crawly bug stuff, avoid this. Im not ready to write it off completely, but this was not the answer to my prayers for more Good Wife. (Monday, 10 p.m., CBS)Uncle Buck is not something that needs another TV adaptation  there was an attempt back in 1990, too  but here we are anyway. Mike Epps is tremendously appealing as Uncle Buck himself, but the show is otherwise nothing too special. Yes, there are giant pancakes, thank god. (Tuesday, 9 p.m., ABC)Animal Kingdom, Tuesday, 9 p.m., TNTWatch if you like early Sons of Anarchy, unsettling family dramas and stories of the seedy side of California.Based on the 2010 Australian film of the same name, Animal Kingdom moves its action to Southern California and swaps in a silky Ellen Barkin for Jacki Weaver as the matriarch of a scuzzy crime family. There are a lot of shows about scuzzy crime families, but Kingdom is a solid enough contribution to the genre, complete with incestuous vibes, dirtbags throwing pool parties and the idea that gunplay is what makes one a man.The show was originally developed for Showtime, and it feels that way  maybe a little more style than substance, but the styles so titillating it might not matter. Barkins the draw here, with additional intrigue from Scott Speedman and Shawn Hatosy.Also this week on basic cable:The five-part documentary O.J.: Made in America continues on ESPN; its unbelievably good, particularly the finale. (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday; 9 p.m., ESPN)Another Period, one of the goofiest shows on TV, returns for its second season. (Catch up for free with Season 1.) The show combines the conventions of the modern-day Bravo-style reality show with the setting of a Downton Abbeyesque manor. Ridiculousness abounds. (Wednesday, 10 p.m., Comedy Central)Mr. Robot, now on Amazon PrimeWatch if you like Black Mirror, psychological thrillers, stories about technology and social commentary.Last summers surprise breakout is finally available to stream. The second season comes out July 13, so you have plenty of time to watch the 10 hourlong episodes  though try to watch them when you have time to concentrate.Our hero is Elliot, a hoodie-clad cybersecurity expert. He joins a group called fsociety, in which like-minded hackers strategize ways to take down the massive E Corp  or as Elliot calls it, Evil Corp. Theres a lot of (accurate) technobabble, but a background in data security is not necessary.The most interesting parts of Mr. Robot are the ways it teases its audience with Elliots unreliability as a narrator and its aggressive anti-consumerism stances/general distaste for capitalism. Theres a slight dip around Episode 6, but things pick back up significantly after that.Im generally not much of a spoilerphobe, but Ill say that Mr. Robot works better if you go in totally unspoiled about plot developments. Google very very carefully.Orange Is the New Black, Season 4 (Friday, Netflix)Watch if you already know and love OITNB.Back to Litchfield we go for another season of Netflixs fantastic ensemble dramedy. If you never watched the show, definitely start at the beginning  the characters personal histories matter a great deal. Earlier seasons suggested that the show could work even without Piper, and this season shes definitely less present than before.Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, ThursdayJerry Seinfelds indulgent but sometimes illuminating web series returns with six more episodes and guests Judd Apatow, Margaret Cho, Lorne Michaels, John Oliver and J.B. Smoove. This weeks season premiere is with Jim Gaffigan.Amazons new pilots, FridayBlock out an hour on Friday to watch Amazons pilot The Interestings, based on Meg Wolitzers book. Its about a group of friends who meet as teenagers at an arts summer camp and grow up messy and complicated. Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under) stars, and if you like relationship-oriented dramas  and boy, do I  you are in for a treat. Theres also The Last Tycoon, starring Matt Bomer (White Collar), and based on F. Scott Fitzgeralds final work.Game of Thrones: The larger issue is that the show burned a lot of calories over the past couple of seasons on Aryas mostly uncaptivating assassin training, only to have her arrive where we expected her to: reaffirming her sense of self and off in search of greater adventures.The Tonys: The relentless march of Hamilton was the news, but Mr. Mirandas megahit was overshadowed by performances from other shows.Veep: International diplomacy aside, in sitcom terms, Camp David is a classic story of two dates on the same night.Silicon Valley: In the end, though, the episode is another affirmation of friendship as a defining value of Pied Piper.Outlander: Its really Jamie, Murtagh and the other men of Outlander that give this episode its power."}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders has had a heck of a year so far in 2016. Millennials clearly respond to him, taking as authentic the stylings of a rumpled, 70-something, radical, balding, Jewish, progressive, born-and-raised New Yorker who moved to the mountains (Vermont) years ago.Since the best museums often channel the Zeitgeist, it shouldnt come as a surprise that another rumpled, 70-something, radical, balding, Jewish, progressive, born-and-raised New Yorker who moved to the mountains (New Mexico) years ago is being honored with a late-career retrospective. Danny Lyon: Message to the Future opens on June 17 at the Whitney Museum of Art, and will feature films and photographs by the celebrated, if combative, photographer.The similarities go beyond age and traits, however: Mr. Lyon and Mr. Sanders were classmates at the University of Chicago. In the run-up to his major retrospective, Mr. Lyon has also been publishing vintage photographs of, and vigorously stumping for, the senator on his blog, Bleak Beauty. We not only shared an early determination to change America, he wrote, we shared a great roommate, Ira Churgin.Its fitting that Mr. Lyons pictures will be on view this summer, as his documentation for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1963 and 1964 echoes the current mood. So many photographs grapple with police brutality, and violence toward the African-American community, issues that resonate powerfully in American culture today.The exhibitions connection to the civil rights movement is no coincidence, however. The well-considered sense of timing dates to 2005, when Julian Cox, a genteel Englishman, had recently been appointed curator of photography at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. He wanted to plan an exhibition to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s assassination, so of course he thought of Mr. Lyon.Danny was obviously a pivotal player in that story, Mr. Cox said. His involvement with the movement, his lifetime friendship with John Lewis and Julian Bond. I called him up and went to visit him. He was surprisingly open towards me.These conversations helped Mr. Cox create Road to Freedom: Photographs of the Civil Rights Movement, 1956-1968, for the High Museum, and they also began a somewhat unlikely working relationship, which culminated in the new Whitney show.I was in Atlanta, this is where his journey began as a photographer, Mr. Cox said. He was a young kid, really, in his early 20s. He was entrusted to get out there and make a record of these various public protests, marches, and demonstrations on a variety of different issues. Voting rights, segregation, et cetera.After SNCC, Mr. Lyon embraced  Hunter S. Thompsons New Journalism, Mr. Cox said, when he joined the Outlaws motorcycle gang and made perhaps his most famous pictures. He also spent 14 months photographing inside the Texas prison system, after he was given unparalleled access by Dr. George Beto, the head of the Texas Department of Corrections at the time.He begins with the civil rights, Mr. Cox said. One side of personal freedom there. He goes to something like Bike Riders, which is the epitome of freedom, riding a motorcycle helmetless across the Ohio River. Then to the opposite side of that, which is incarceration, and the lack of freedom, and what that can do to ones soul.Those prison pictures, as heartbreaking and insightful as they are, echo todays headlines, given this countrys grim incarceration statistics, and the recent phenomenon of for-profit prisons. On that subject, Mr. Lyon made his opinions quite clear in a recent email: I think it is both immoral and for me personally repugnant that anyone, including a stock holder would want to make a profit by imprisoning another human being.I think the companies that do this should be identified, as should all mutual funds that own that stock. The media should identify the CEOs of these companies and these people should be shunned socially.By 2010, when Mr. Cox moved to San Francisco to become founding curator of photography at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and chief curator at the de Young Museum, he had gotten to know Mr. Lyon quite well. He had the rare privilege of reading directly from the photographers diaries, which led Mr. Cox to believe there was much in the mid-to-late career work that deserved a broader audience, including pictures made about immigration in New Mexico, where Mr. Lyon had moved in 1970.Mr. Cox also discovered that Elisabeth Sussman at the Whitney happened to agree, so together they planned the Message to the Future exhibition, and an attendant catalog, which will eventually travel to the de Young Museum and to institutions in Switzerland and Germany. Both museums are committing vast resources on both coasts to share Mr. Lyons work with the world, ensuring that his combative energy will continue to provoke thought and discussion.Actually, the very best of Dannys work has a lot of emotional impact, Mr. Cox said. It has oomph. It has electric energy and wattage.I want people to feel that when theyre walking through the galleries of the Whitney Museum, and the Fine Arts Museums here. If Ive done my job well, then people will feel the impact of those pictures.Jonathan Blaustein is an artist and writer based in New Mexico.

{"text": "MILWAUKEE  Mets Manager Terry Collins felt ill about an hour before Sundays game in Milwaukee and was taken to a nearby hospital for tests, the Mets assistant general manager John Ricco said. The bench coach Dick Scott, who last managed with Class A South Bend in 1997, took over for Collins.Ricco offered no specifics about what was wrong with Collins but promised to update reporters later in the day.Collins, 66, seemed fine speaking to reporters in his office about two and a half hours before the game at Miller Park. He reviewed the limited options off his bench: Second baseman Neil Walker (stiff back) and outfielder Michael Conforto (sore wrist) werent available, and Collins hoped to give shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera his first complete day off this season.Managing in the minor leagues, youre used to it because it happens all the time, he said. In 84 I had to activate myself to give us enough players to play. If youve done it as long as Ive been doing it, its just part of the game."}
{"text": "This is not a column about Donald Trump.Its not about the fraudulent scheme that was Trump University. Its not about his history of failing to pay contractors, leading to hundreds of legal actions. Its not about how he personally profited while running his casinos into the ground. Its not even concerned with persistent questions about whether he is nearly as rich as he claims to be, and whether hes ever done more than live off capital gains on his inheritance.No, my question, as Democrats gleefully tear into the Trump business record, is why rival Republicans never did the same. How did someone who looks so much like a cheap con man bulldoze right through the G.O.P. nomination process?I mean, its not as if any of this dirt was deeply hidden. The Trump U. story was out there long before it became the big deal it is today. It took some real reporting to flesh out the details of Mr. Trumps other business practices, but were talking about ordinary if skillful journalistic legwork, not revelations from Deep Throat.So why didnt any of Mr. Trumps primary opponents manage to make an issue of his sleazy business career? Were they just incompetent, or is there something structural about the modern Republican Party that makes it unable to confront grifters?The answer, Id argue, is the latter.Rick Perlstein, who has documented the rise of modern conservatism in a series of eye-opening books, points out that there has always been a close association between the movement and the operations of snake-oil salesmen  people who use lists of campaign contributors, right-wing websites and so on to sell get-rich-quick schemes and miracle health cures.Sometimes the political link is direct: dire warnings about the coming depression/hyperinflation, from which you can only protect yourself by buying Ron Pauls DVDs (the Ron Paul curriculum) or gold shares hawked by Glenn Beck. Sometimes it just seems to reflect a judgment on the part of the grifters that people who can be persuaded that President Obama is Muslim can also be persuaded that there are easy money-making opportunities the establishment doesnt want you to know about.Theres also a notable pattern of conservative political stars engaging in what is supposed to be activism, but looks a lot like personal enrichment. For example, Sarah Palins SarahPAC gives only a few percent of what it raises on candidates, while spending heavily on consultants and Mrs. Palins travels.Then theres the issue of ideology. If your fundamental premise is that the profit motive is always good and government is the root of all evil, if you treat any suggestion that, say, some bankers misbehaved in the run-up to the financial crisis as proof that the speaker is anti-business if not a full-blown socialist, how can you condemn anyones business practices?Consider this: Even as the newspapers are filled with stories of defrauded students and stiffed contractors, Republicans in Congress are going all-out in efforts to repeal the so-called fiduciary rule for retirement advisers, a new rule requiring that they serve the interests of their clients, and not receive kickbacks for steering them into bad investments. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, has even made repealing that rule part of his anti-poverty plan. So the G.O.P. is in effect defending the right of the financial industry to mislead its customers, which makes it hard to attack the likes of Donald Trump.Finally, the con job that lies at the heart of so much Republican politics makes it hard to go after other, more commercial cons. Its interesting to note that Marco Rubio actually did try to make Trump University an issue, but he did it too late, after he had already made himself a laughingstock with his broken-record routine. And heres the thing: The groove Mr. Rubio got stuck in  innuendo that the president is deliberately weakening America  was a typical example of the political snake-oil the right sells along with free money and three-minute cures for high blood pressure.The point is that Mr. Rubio was just as much a con artist as Mr. Trump  just not as good at it, which is why, under pressure, he kept repeating the same memorized words. So he, like all the G.O.P. contenders, didnt have what it would have taken to make Mr. Trumps grifting an issue. But at least so far it appears that Hillary Clinton and her allies wont have the same problem.In the months ahead Republicans will claim that there are equivalent scandals on the Democratic side, but nothing theyve managed to come up with rises remotely to the level of even one of the many Trump scams in the news. Theyll also claim that Mr. Trump doesnt reflect their partys values. But the truth is that in a very deep sense he does. And thats why they couldnt stop him."}
{"text": "IN 1985, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed that New York State divest of its billions of dollars in investments in companies that did business with South Africa to demonstrate, he declared, the abhorrence of our residents to the pernicious system of apartheid. An opponent of Mr. Cuomos plan, the state comptroller, Edward V. Regan, told The New York Times, Were not in the foreign-policy business.State Republicans blocked Mr. Cuomos efforts, and he ultimately settled for divesting personally from apartheid, withdrawing his personal funds from banks with ties to South Africa.How times have changed.Last week, Mario Cuomos son, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, signed an executive order essentially creating a blacklist of entities that boycott or divest from Israel or encourage others to do so, banning those companies from receiving taxpayer funding.The movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, known as B.D.S., is a strategy intended to combat Israels nearly 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza, a situation that three former Israeli prime ministers, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry, have warned would become akin to apartheid if allowed to continue.I oppose Israels occupation and I want the Palestinians to have equal rights and self-determination. Still, I do not support a boycott that targets Israel as a whole. While I avoid buying products from companies that operate in Israeli settlements, I do so out of commitment to the two-state solution and my belief that the occupation endangers Israels future as a Jewish and democratic state.But I also believe that economic boycott is a legitimate form of political expression, one that the government has no business restricting by withholding state business.Paradoxically, Mr. Cuomo has engaged in a type of boycott himself, issuing three executive orders banning nonessential travel by state employees to Indiana, Mississippi and North Carolina for discriminatory laws against L.G.B.T. people. Apparently, in Mr. Cuomos book, boycotts are acceptable against American states with discriminatory laws, but not against a foreign country that has systematically subjected millions of people to decades of oppression.Documents from statehouses where anti-B.D.S. bills have passed, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, show that there is a concerted effort by advocacy groups, like the Israeli American Council, and even the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic sect, to promote anti-B.D.S. legislation in statehouses and in Congress.While bills in other states have, for better or worse, gained legislators approval, Mr. Cuomos executive order is the first to be instituted without democratic ratification. After it became clear a bill with the same purpose would not pass the State Assembly, Mr. Cuomo decided he wanted to take immediate action, as he put it at the orders signing, joking that the legislative process was often a tedious affair.Legal scholars on both sides of the issue have raised flags. On Twitter, Katherine Franke, a professor at Columbia Law School who sits on the Academic Advisory Council of the pro-boycott group Jewish Voice for Peace, called the order clearly unconstitutional.Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern Universitys Pritzker School of Law, who has supported anti-boycott legislation, has suggested that Mr. Cuomos executive order could run up against the First Amendment, and that its language penalizing advocacy of boycott or divestment  the measure is aimed at those who participate in pro-boycott activity or promote others to engage in it  was a bridge too far.In analyzing a similar law passed in South Carolina last month, The Harvard Law Review wrote that the motivation behind such laws could not be more antithetical to the core values of the First Amendment.Worse yet, the vagueness of Mr. Cuomos executive order raises more questions than it answers. For example, as the owner of a small web-design business who occasionally does freelance work for CUNY schools and state agencies, will I be denied contracts because I argued against buying SodaStream home carbonation systems while they were being manufactured in a settlement on the West Bank? If a filmmaker declares support for boycotting Israel, will the state deny her production company access to shoot at the new state-funded production center near Syracuse? If a churchs national assembly backs divestment from Israel, will it be denied state grants to operate homeless shelters and soup kitchens in Brooklyn?And what about companies working in the West Bank that succumb to the economic pressure of boycotts or divestment and move their operations? Will the State of New York tell a private enterprise that it must choose between losing money because of boycotters or losing contracts with the state?But this is also personal. As a Jew who has lived in Israel and has many relatives there, I feel that the government should not be dictating how I relate to the Jewish state and in what ways I voice my objection to its policies. Regardless of how one feels about the Israeli occupation and the B.D.S. movement, Mr. Cuomos decision should be an unsettling precedent."}
{"text": "For the 26-year-old Nigerian designer Adebayo Oke-Lawal, whose brand Orange Culture held a presentation in a showroom at London Collections Men this weekend, fashion is a very personal business. Were trying to communicate the idea of a new generation of African men, he told T of the intentions behind his gender-fluid mens wear line. As a child growing up, I found I was very lost in trying to figure out who I was as a person. I wanted to create a brand that sort of represented that sphere of men: a man thats vulnerable, a man thats a bit soft, a man thats emotional.The result, now in its 10th season, is a line that combines mens wear silhouettes with traditionally feminine details: cowl-necks, bright colors, transparent fabrics. For spring/summer 2017, Oke-Lawal has focused on two prints: the first is Faces of Rebellion, inspired by the faces of his own Yoruba tribe and other tribes of Nigeria; the second is a series of illustrations of hands, peppered with familiar gestures like the crossed fingers and the peace sign. Orange Culture also sells jewelry, including hand-shaped pendants and earrings in bronze.From a rail of garments, the designer pulls out a hybrid of a bomber jacket and a tunic in a translucent material. We started making sheer pieces in Nigeria two seasons ago, and a lot of people really were like, Oh you shouldnt be making this  its feminine. Its wrong, he recalls. Now weve actually started getting orders for the sheer pieces. Its become a staple for us.Oke-Lawal  who has a degree in banking, but no formal fashion training  taught himself to sew. He studied pattern-cutting on YouTube, and took internships with Nigerian designers. He designed his first collection in 2011 and was a finalist for the LVMH Prize in 2014. Today, the brand is sold online by Not Just A Label, and at the Church Boutique in Hollywood (Oke-Lawal is also in discussion with a New York retailer); Nigerian stockists include the stores Alara, Grey Velvet and Stranger Lagos.The fashion scene in his home city is changing rapidly. Its only been five years since we first had a consistent fashion week, he says. The Lagos scene is becoming more vibrant, it is awakening. People are seeing it as a viable venture to get into, because now it has a voice, it has a face  a lot of faces, you know. The best thing about it is, because its so fresh, theres an innocence about the industry; everybodys just going along with it, and building it as they go."}
{"text": "Momentous elections turn on momentous questions. In 2016 the question is clear: What has gotten into peoples heads?BrainDead, which begins on CBS Monday, has a theory: bugs. Specifically, antlike insects that have turned up in Washington after a meteor strike and crawled into the ears of politicians and their staffers, turning them into  well, themselves, but more obnoxious.BrainDead is a fun summer experiment, with a loopy, I-cant-believe-this-got-on-CBS charm. Its sci-fi, its comedy, its political commentary. But its also about as nuanced as an ant colony lodged in your cranium.Our field guide to our new insect overlords is Laurel Healy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who was born into a political dynasty but would rather be shooting documentaries about Melanesian choirs.Strapped for cash, Laurel moves from Los Angeles to work as an aide for her brother, Luke (Danny Pino), a Democratic senator, amid a looming government shutdown. When she notices many of her new associates acting strangely  personalities change, the occasional head explodes  she finds herself on the trail of the creepy-crawly ant-agonists.The 1956 movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers used a comparable premise  alien invaders replace humans with emotionless replicas  as an allegory of Cold War-era groupthink. In BrainDead, the evil is tribalism, the forces that make political sides march in lock step like good soldier ants.Here, the insects work by making their victims more extreme. Conservatives become more stridently determined to decimate the federal government. Liberals find themselves robotically quoting statistics about the wonders of Scandinavia.BrainDead is the brainchild of Robert and Michelle King, the creators of The Good Wife (whose Zach Grenier, Nikki M. James and Megan Hilty appear). That legal drama began with a political scandal and was packed with subtle commentary on current events.Good Wife fans will recognize its appealing quirkiness here. The insects and their hosts, for instance, are crazy for the 1984 hit by the Cars, You Might Think. (Yes, the ear bugs have an earworm.) Later episodes  CBS previewed three in total  begin with musical previously on segments by the offbeat folk-rocker Jonathan Coulton.The series has a flair for the dorky details of Washington-professional life, as when Laurel and her Republican counterpart Gareth (Aaron Tveit) dance the white-man-and-womans-overbite at a dinner called the Tax Prom (an actual thing). Throughout, BrainDead has the goofy-A-student vibe of a particularly saucy public-radio show.The other parts of this mash-up are weaker. The sci-fi plotting is perfunctory. Ms. Winstead is charming, but Laurel is conceived mainly as an audience surrogate, there to roll her eyes for us at the egos in Washington. (The city is described, in a not-so-original quip, as Hollywood, but with uglier people.) The pols, like Tony Shalhoubs boorish Republican senator, are flat characters even before they come down with brain-bugs.The satire boils down to Its time those Beltway politicians stopped squabbling and got to work for us, a take with all the heat of a public-service spot from a centrist think tank. Its blunt yet generic.At the same time, the show aims to be specific and current by editing in news clips from the current campaign. And sure, the brain-snatching metaphor certainly rings true when weve seen, in real life, a politician who once warned that Donald J. Trump couldnt be trusted with the nuclear codes now stoically supporting him for president.But the allegory feels limited and easy. After all, the extremism in our politics doesnt just come from the capital. Its in the supporters and protesters cold-cocking each other at rallies. Its in the hashtag-and-burn vitriol of our social media echo chambers. We have met the animus, and it is us.Sometimes BrainDead hints at this bigger context. In the background of scenes, the news is reported almost entirely on two fictional cable channels, one of which blames every problem on Democrats, the other on Republicans. Its a small but clever reminder of the vast systems our science-fact world already has to put a partisan bug in your ear."}
{"text": "IN the fight to fend off Donald J. Trumps conquest of the Republican Party, there has been no fiercer faction this year than the Mormons.Throughout the primaries, Mr. Trump was pummeled in the Book of Mormon Belt. In Utah, he suffered one of his worst defeats, finishing dead last with a paltry 14 percent of the vote. Outside Utah, he often underperformed in counties where Mormons were more heavily concentrated.On some level, this dynamic might seem intuitive. Mormonism is a faith that holds up chastity as a virtue and condemns pornography as a soul-rotting vice; Mr. Trump is an unabashed adulterer who has posed for Playboy covers. Mormons draw inspiration from their ancestors modest frontier frugality; Mr. Trump travels the world in a tricked-out Boeing 757 with his name stamped conspicuously across the fuselage.Many conservative Christians were willing to overlook these defects during the primaries because they liked what Mr. Trump had to say about issues like immigration. But Mormons are considerably more conflicted about his mad-as-hell message  and their ambivalence could cost the candidate in Western swing states.Of all the iniquities committed in this less-than-saintly campaign season, only one has managed to elicit an official response from Mormon headquarters in Salt Lake City: Mr. Trumps call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns, the churchs statement read. However, it is not neutral in relation to religious freedom.Its easy to see how Mormons might get spooked by a presidential contender bashing a religious minority. Early Latter-day Saints spent much of the mid-19th century being chased into the desert by bigots and demagogues. Elected officials tried to exterminate them. Propagandists painted them as a nefarious foreign race (defined, according to a report printed in multiple medical journals, by their yellow, sunken, cadaverous visage and thick, protuberant lips). In an eerie bit of foreshadowing, the United States secretary of state sought in 1879 to restrict the flow of Mormon immigrants from overseas, arguing that America must be protected from these prospective lawbreakers.Mormon leaders have not forgotten this history. As Elder Patrick Kearon said in April while announcing a new churchwide relief effort for refugees, Their story is our story, not that many years ago.There are other reasons for Mr. Trumps failure to rally Mormon voters. His hard-line immigration stance clashes with the more merciful views of the church, many of whose members have served proselytizing missions in Latin America. (One recent study found that Mormons are more than twice as likely as evangelicals to say they welcome more immigration to the United States.)Whats more, Mr. Trumps pitchfork populism doesnt hold the same visceral appeal for a religious community with above-average education levels, relatively stable families and comfortable middle-class incomes. The urgency to Make America Great Again may not be quite so deeply felt.With the primaries over, most anti-Trump conservatives have abandoned any righteous resistance and begun their dutiful trudge toward supporting the partys nominee. But there are signs that Mormons  who represent the most reliably Republican religious group in the country  may not fall in line so easily.In Utah, a deep-red state that no Democrat has won since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, a recent poll shows Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton running neck and neck, with the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson  who has his campaign headquarters in Salt Lake City  picking up 16 percent, and nearly one-third of despairing respondents opting for other. (For perspective, George W. Bush won the state with 71 percent of the vote in 2004.)Even if Utah ultimately submits to the pull of partisanship as expected, it remains an open question whether Mormons at large will stay engaged in the process. In an expansive Gallup report released last month, none of the 62 demographic groups surveyed were more ambivalent toward both presumptive nominees than Mormons were: Just 33 percent had a favorable view of Mr. Trump; for Mrs. Clinton, it was 21 percent. Such disillusionment could have consequences. The Mountain West has emerged as a general-election battleground in recent years, with explosive Latino growth and other demographic trends turning states that once leaned Republican, like Nevada and Colorado, into November tossups. And in the scrambled electoral map of 2016, Arizona looks increasingly as if it will be in play.While Mormons make up only about 3 percent to 6 percent of the population in these states, the G.O.P. counts on them. They have high turnout and a reputation in campaign circles as top-notch canvassers unafraid of knocking on strangers doors. Their tightly networked communities constitute a reliable political fund-raising apparatus, thanks to the Romney campaign. In states like Colorado  which President Obama won in 2012 by fewer than 120,000 votes  the last thing Republicans need is for Trump-averse Mormons to sit this race out.Its entirely possible that, in the end, conservative Mormons will dutifully show up on Election Day and pull the lesser-of-two-evils lever for Mr. Trump. But until then, Mitt Romney has made clear hell continue to speak out against his partys nominee  and many of his coreligionists will be listening. As he told The Wall Street Journal last month, There are some people, though its a small number, who still value my opinion."}

The Golden State Warriors were practicing Sunday when they learned that one of their most important pieces would be absent from Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals on Monday.Coach Steve Kerr approached Draymond Green, the teams do-everything forward, and told him that he had been suspended.Hes disappointed, Kerr said.The N.B.A. announced Sunday that the league had retroactively assessed Green with a flagrant-1 foul for striking the Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James in the groin in the fourth quarter of the Warriors 108-97 Game 4 victory on Friday, triggering an automatic one-game suspension, per league rules.A flagrant-1 foul is less severe than a flagrant-2, which results in an automatic ejection. However, four flagrant foul points in the postseason (two points for a flagrant-2, one point for a flagrant-1) result in a suspension. Green, who has had trouble keeping his appendages to himself in recent weeks, already had three.It was a seismic decision by the N.B.A., with the Warriors heading into Game 5 at Oracle Arena with a three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series and an opportunity to clinch their second straight championship. Greens value to the team is difficult to overstate. In the finals, Green is averaging 14.8 points, 9.3 rebounds and 5.8 assists while playing more than 38 minutes a game. Without him, the Warriors will need to find solutions by committee. Green did not address the news media.We know its going to kill him not being there, shooting guard Klay Thompson said. But were going to go out there and do it as a team and win for him.The Warriors sounded edgy about the situation. Andrew Bogut, the teams starting center, said he had no doubt that the Cavaliers had lobbied for Greens suspension. Bogut also described the N.B.A.s disciplinary system as one without rhyme or reason and compared it to the leagues draft lottery process.Pull out a Ping-Pong ball and make a decision, Bogut said. They made a decision, which was an interesting one.On Friday, after James pushed Green to the court late in the fourth quarter and tried to step over him, Green retaliated by swiping at James and making contact with his groin. After the game, James said he was not cool with some things that Green had said to him. Green, in turn, took offense to the way James had stepped over him.On Sunday, Kiki Vandeweghe, the N.B.A.s executive vice president for basketball operations, said in a statement that while Greens actions in Green 4 did not merit a suspension as a stand-alone act, he was deserving of a flagrant foul. It was an accumulation of offenses that resulted in the one-game suspension.The series  already physical  has reached a heightened state. After Sundays practice, Thompson basically accused James of being a crybaby.I guess his feelings just got hurt, Thompson said, adding: Guys talk trash in this league all the time. Im just kind of shocked some guys take it so personal. I mean, its a mans league, and Ive heard a lot of bad things on that court. But at the end of the day, it stays on the court.When James was informed of Thompsons comments, he asked a reporter to repeat them. Then he laughed.Oh, my goodness, James said. Its so hard to take the high road. Ive been doing it for 13 years. Its so hard to continue to do it, and Im going to do it again.Green has always had a tendency to treat games like high-wire acts. Consider his well-publicized blowup inside the Warriors locker room at halftime of a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder in February. His volatility can fuel his play and that of his teammates (the Warriors wound up winning that game against Oklahoma City), but he also risks becoming a distraction.We thrive off of Draymonds competitiveness and his edge, Kerr said, and its been very important for us this year. And maybe that same quality has led him to this point  just his competitiveness and his passion. And thats all part of it.Bogut said that Green had to play with emotion, otherwise he would not be nearly as effective. So the Warriors accept the pros while bracing for any potential cons.Against Portland in the conference semifinals, Green was borderline obsessed with psychological games. After guaranteeing one win, he declared that the Trail Blazers playoff chances were dead before the series was over. His fondness for the dramatic arts bled onto the court, where he swung his arms in reaction to a call and made inadvertent contact with the official Ken Mauer, who had to seek treatment for a cut to his hand.Greens fire worked out against the Trail Blazers because he produced, averaging 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists over the course of the series as the Warriors advanced.Against the Thunder in the conference finals, Green kicked Steven Adams in the groin in Game 3, drawing a flagrant-2 foul, and tripped Enes Kanter in Game 4. (The league did not penalize Green for the latter offense, and perhaps he was fortunate.)But all the outside noise appeared to affect him. In Games 3 and 4 against the Thunder, Green scored a total of 12 points while shooting 2 of 16 from the field.Now, with the Warriors on the cusp of a championship, they will need to find a way to cope with his absence.We know we have the personnel and the depth to come out and get a win, and thats all that really matters, Stephen Curry said. It honestly doesnt matter what we think about what he did or didnt do. The situation is what it is, and weve got to win."}
{"text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.  Much of Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals was part hockey, part speedskating. When it was over on Sunday night, the Pittsburgh Penguins had their second title in eight years and their fourth in franchise history, defeating the San Jose Sharks, 3-1.What turned out to be the winning goal typified the high-end skill on display throughout the series. The Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby fed defenseman Kris Letang for a one-timer low in the right face-off circle that found its way into the San Jose net at 7 minutes 46 seconds of the second period.And despite encouragement from the spirited crowd inside SAP Center for the Sharks first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals in their 25-year history, San Jose could not find the equalizer before Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist scored an insurance goal into an empty net with 1:02 left in the third period.The game ended when Crosby cleared the puck the length of the ice with San Jose on a power play, and then the celebration began.Man, Im going to remember this day for the rest of my entire life, said the rookie Penguins goaltender Matthew Murray, who faced only 19 shots in the clinching game.Murray, who is 22, added: I probably wont believe this until next year, to be honest. Its so surreal.Crosby, who had 19 postseason points, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is given to the most valuable player of the playoffs. During his postgame media conference, he drew comparisons with the first cup he won in 2009, his fourth of 11 seasons in the league.I have a greater appreciation this time around, the 28-year-old Crosby said, noting that after back-to-back appearances in the finals in 2008 and 2009, you just think its going to be an annual thing.With the core we have, he added, you think everyones going to stay together, the teams not going to change. But it does.None of Pittsburghs four Stanley Cup wins have come on home ice. Although the Stanley Cup presentation was made inside SAP Center by N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman, thousands of Penguins supporters were able to celebrate at a watch party inside Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh.Center Evgeni Malkin said the championship felt as good as the 2009 title, and he was not surprised that it took so long to win it again.Its not easy to win in this league. They have 30 good teams, Malkin said. We played against a tough San Jose team, and they not win in 25 years. Its not easy. San Jose a great team, great coaches. But its tough to win. Im glad finally we win.Malkin added: We did a great job. Actually, tonight we worked so hard, we deserved to win.For the fifth time in the six games, the Penguins opened the scoring.With Sharks forward Dainius Zubrus in the penalty box for tripping, Brian Dumoulins shot from the left point eluded San Jose goaltender Martin Jones at 8:16 of the first period. Jones, who made 24 saves, was more formidable later in the period, however, making two quick saves on Crosby in a five-second span after a Sharks giveaway.The Sharks tied the game, 1-1, at 6:27 of the second period when center Logan Couture used Penguins defenseman Justin Schultz as a screen and beat Murray with a 21-foot wrist shot. The goal was Coutures 30th point of the playoffs, the best in the league.But Letang answered 79 seconds later, and San Jose could not draw even again.The Sharks, who finished third in the Pacific Division, fell short of their goal, but they went a long way toward erasing their reputation as playoff underachievers with wins over the Los Angeles Kings, the Nashville Predators and the St. Louis Blues.Im very proud of our group, Sharks Coach Peter DeBoer said. I thought our guys emptied the tank, gave us everything they possibly could. We werent as good as them during this two-week period.The challenge Pittsburgh presented went beyond their well-recognized team speed, he added. They have good sticks, too. They force you into quicker decisions. They really challenge your execution. We hadnt seen pressure and sticks like that through the first three rounds.Pittsburgh had entered the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Metropolitan Division, defeating the Rangers, the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning en route to the finals.The Penguins righted their season after Mike Sullivan replaced Mike Johnston on Dec. 12 as coach when the team was near .500.We changed style, Malkin said of the coaching change. Before, we played more D-zone; now we played in offensive zone. We use our legs. We skate with puck, we skate without puck. Always skating."}
{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea  My mother fled South Korea for two years in her 20s because she couldnt stomach her domineering father. On her return, she was married off to my conservative father, whom she gradually realized she didnt care for. Divorce was still taboo, so she opted to go to Canada with me in tow. The pretext for this long-distance marriage was my education, but it was also for her freedom from patriarchal expectations.More than two decades have passed. She keeps her address in Canada but now spends considerable time with my father in Seoul. She also dines occasionally with her father, a frail man in his 90s. The arrangement works since the men in her life have grown subdued and she has more say over her life. With time, gender equality came to our family. Patiently waiting for improvement in gender relations, however, is not a strategy for South Korea.The country awoke on May 17 to shocking news that a young woman had been stabbed to death in a bar restroom in a busy shopping district in Seoul. Reports of murder are hardly rare in this country, but the 30-something male suspects motive stunned people. After the arrest, he told the police that he committed the crime because women had always ignored him.The incident prompted testimonials from many women about the amount of misogyny they endure. A large number of men, in turn, dismissed the notion that the killing was an act of misogyny and said that women were being hysterical.Many men would rather not acknowledge that South Korea is an entrenched patriarchy and that toxic gender relations are taking a toll on society. Womens status has stalled in the 21st century. Too many of them are treated like second-class citizens and suffer undue violence, objectification and discrimination.There is no easy solution, but one important step would be to pass the anti-discrimination bill, which has stalled in the National Assembly for nearly a decade. It would mandate equal treatment for everyone regardless of gender or other factors. A clearly worded law would signal that women and minorities deserve equal rights.Its only on the surface that South Korea has made strides toward equality for women. The first female president currently leads the nation. We have an independent ministry of gender equality and family. Some 24-hour convenience stores are designated as places of refuge for women fleeing harm.Still, the reality for South Korean women remains bleak.Women made up 86 percent of all violent crime victims in 2013, according to police data (most violent crime is sexual in nature, and women suffer disproportionately from sexual crimes). Women arent safe at home, either: Reports of violence against women perpetrated by their husbands have been rising in recent years.Women fare just as poorly in how theyre depicted. South Korean movies often show images of unimaginable cruelty toward the female body. A popular television cooking show recently described sizzling strips of pork belly as better-looking than the rear of a young girl-group member.Its no wonder then that the World Economic Forum ranks the country 115th out of 145 countries in gender equality. Women earn only two-thirds of what men earn, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. Women made up 2.3 percent of corporate executives at 348 of the largest 500 companies in South Korea in 2015 (others were exempt from reporting).The typical male response to the May 17 killing hints at just how deep misogyny runs. Men invaded the memorial websites for the victim and flooded comment sections, telling women they were overreacting.You are as helpless as you let yourself be, one man said on Facebook.The culture of misogyny and gender inequality may be affecting family life, in a country facing predictions of population collapse. Research shows that a low fertility rate in developed countries reflects backward attitudes over female gender roles. Last year, the South Korean marriage rate tumbled to the lowest level in 12 years, and the birth rate is perennially one of the lowest in the world.Meanwhile, South Korean men hold the record for doing the least amount of housework among the men in the worlds most developed countries  an average of just 45 minutes per day, or one-fifth of the time a South Korean woman spends.As gender discussions heated up after the bar killing, the police asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission, the agency in charge of monitoring the internet, to delete online posts, which were said to exacerbate the tensions, in order to prevent online conflicts from manifesting as society-wide conflicts.The government routinely scrubs what it deems unsavory from the internet, so this action wasnt unusual. But in this case  removing individual citizens posts that used colorful language to express low opinions of men or women  it simply shut down the debate about women in society. Stifling speech is no cure for a rot deep inside South Korea.Passing the long-stalled anti-discrimination bill would help reduce discrimination, create legal protections and compensation, and, hopefully, reduce misogyny. Although various United Nations conventions urge adoption of such a law, similar efforts have failed three times in the National Assembly since 2007 due to objections from the evangelical lobby and the business community.My mother has made peace with her life. Its her father who now regrets having infringed on her freedom. You couldve become a somebody, he repeats at family meals, recalling her various talents. His change of heart comes too late for her, but its not too late to give respect to South Korean women of new generations."}
{"text": "It started as a fairly simple proposition: There were two schools on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, one overcrowded, the other underused. The citys Education Department proposed to redraw the schools attendance zone so that some blocks assigned to the crowded school would be shifted to the emptier one.But while most of the children at the crowded school, Public School 199, are middle class and white, most of the children at the other school, P.S. 191, are poor, and black or Hispanic. P.S. 191 has much lower test scores, and last year, the state labeled the school persistently dangerous, though many of its supporters argued that this was a mistake.The proposal  became complicated as families in the blocks that would be affected objected to the change. The department ultimately dropped the idea.Now, instead of a simple solution, the department is considering a convoluted one that amounts to an educational game of musical chairs: First, P.S. 191 would move a block west, taking over a building under construction that was originally intended for a new school. The hope is that the move would provide a symbolic fresh start for P.S. 191 and that the gleaming campus would make it more appealing to the families moved there. Then, another school on the Upper West Side, P.S. 452, which shares a building with two other schools, would move into P.S. 191s current home, giving it room to grow. The school that had been envisioned for the new building would not open.The appeal to the Education Department is clear: P.S. 452s student population closely mirrors P.S. 199s, and its principal, David Scott Parker, used to be an assistant principal there. Families moved out of P.S. 199 might be more open to P.S. 452 than to P.S. 191, and persuading them to go to P.S. 452 could be easier than getting them to take a chance on a completely new school.Its always challenging to attract families to a brand-new school, particularly in a community that has a variety of well-established schools, Elizabeth Rose, the departments deputy chancellor for operations, said. Moving P.S. 452, she said, would allow an existing, strongly community-supported school to grow. She said the department was in a very early stage of assessing this as one of the possible options for moving forward.The proposal, to be discussed at a zoning meeting at P.S. 452 on Monday, has already been met with a divided reaction.The principal of P.S. 191, Lauren Keville, supports the idea of moving to the new building.A new school building will come with exciting new technology and expansive resources, so we look forward to discussions about this opportunity, she said in an email.P.S. 452 would move 16 blocks, from 77th Street to 61st Street. While Mr. Parker, the principal, and some parents support moving, since it would give the school its own building, other parents say that the longer commute would deprive their children of the benefits of attending a true neighborhood school, such as bumping into classmates on the playground.Brian Byrd said that his twins, in first grade at P.S. 452, walked to school with their friends, just as he did growing up in New Jersey. He said he was not sure whether he would keep them in the school if it relocated. He might move his family to the Upper East Side.For us, its almost a 20-block difference in an area that we have no connection to, none whatsoever, Mr. Byrd said.Some believe that the opposition is about more than just the commute. P.S. 191s building is across the street from a public housing complex, where many of its students live. If P.S. 452 moved into that building, its new attendance zone would probably include part of the complex.Parents opposed to the move have had to defend themselves against the suggestion that they oppose a change to the schools demographics.The thing is, I really do believe in integration; I really do think every child that goes to public school deserves a good education and deserves to be safe and stable and all of those things, Sara Roucloux, a member of the Parent-Teacher Association at P.S. 452, said.But she said she did not understand why this little school on 77th Street might be moved 16 blocks south.Melissa Birnbaum, who has a son and a daughter at the school, said of those against the idea, Theyre terrified what that would look like if the school were to be in that area abutting the projects.She said she supported the proposal.But Scott Edelstein, who has two sons at P.S. 452 and opposes the relocation, said he did not think that a high-performing school could move into a poor area and not change.My limited anecdotal understanding of American society is that a school is ultimately and eventually a reflection of its community, he said.Who does a school belong to? Mr. Edelstein asked. Does a school belong to its principal? Does it belong to its current faculty?The only idea that makes any sense to me personally is that a school belongs to the neighborhood where it resides, he said.The meeting on Monday will be held by the zoning committee for the Community Education Council of District 3, which includes the three schools. The council votes on zone lines, but the building moves would have to be approved by the Panel for Educational Policy, a citywide body.Mr. Parker, the principal of P.S. 452, said in an email: While this is only the beginning of the process and no proposal was set forth, we value that the D.O.E. is evaluating ways that we can serve the children of District 3."}
{"text": "ALBANY  For skeptics of the chronically criticized members of the New York State Legislature, the 2016 legislative session has often seemed in danger of becoming what some Albany watchdogs used to call a Seinfeld session  all about nothing.Bills on big issues like ethics, climate change and the tax-break and development program known as 421-a have languished, while chronic wish-list entries like the Dream Act, a tuition aid program for undocumented immigrants popular with Democrats and disliked by Republicans, have also foundered.Of course, optimists  and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomos administration  will point to accomplishments announced at the budget deadline in late March, which included passing a multipronged $15 minimum wage law (or $12.50 by 2021 in upstate areas); a paid family leave law; and a middle-class tax cut for families earning less than $300,000. And as is usually the way in Albany, the looming deadline of the end of session  on Thursday, with just three days left on the schedule  will likely result in a flurry of long nights.Here is a rundown of some of the possible last-minute additions to the inevitable end-of-session news release from the governors office and legislative leaders.HEROIN One of the few issues on which the three men in a room  the governor, the speaker of the Assembly and the Senate majority leader  can agree is a pressing need for action on the rising tide of drug-addicted New Yorkers, a crisis fed by prescription drugs and even cheaper, easier-to-get heroin. After a meeting in the executive chamber on Thursday, John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who leads that partys majority in the Senate, was expansive on the issue, saying that this is something everybody cares deeply about, including the gentleman we just left, the governor.Indeed, shortly after Mr. Flanagan spoke, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, issued the findings of a task force on the drug, with more than two dozen recommendations  including changes to insurance rules, limits on opiate prescriptions and an increase in treatment beds  which will most likely be reflected in legislation. Republicans note that their own task force, which dates from 2014, has already advanced nearly a dozen bills on opioids that have become law. Clearly, the Republicans said on Thursday, we have been at the forefront.BREAST CANCER The governors connection to this issue is personal: His longtime girlfriend, Sandra Lee, was found to have breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy last year. Mr. Cuomo has pushed for more screening, and used it as a final emotional anecdote during his State of the State address in January. Since then, he has repeatedly mentioned it when questioned about his end-of-the-session priorities, and on Sunday announced a deal with Mr. Flanagan and Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who leads the Assembly, to ease access to mammograms and other means of detection.MAYORAL CONTROL If ever there was an issue that seemingly exposed deeper political schisms in Albany, the control of New York Citys schools is it. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, has repeatedly sought multiple-year deals from lawmakers in Albany only to be summarily rejected by Mr. Flanagan, who meted out a single year last session and seems intent on doing the same this year. Mr. Flanagans reluctance to sign off on a multiple-year deal comes despite the governors advocacy of a three-year deal and the Democratic-led Assemblys willingness to do the same.FANTASY SPORTS Fans of hand-to-hand combat got a big victory this year when the Legislature and Mr. Cuomo legalized mixed marital arts. Now it seems that fans of imaginary online head-to-head battles may also prevail, as legislative leaders seem close to a deal on making daily fantasy sports legal in the state, after New Yorks attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, effectively tackled the industry last fall. Mr. Cuomo, however, must still weigh in, though the heavily advertised sites seem likely to get back in business in New York.RIDE-HAILING APPS The start-ups that revolutionized cab and livery car service in New York City  Uber and Lyft  have not yet been able to spread their app-based transportation across the state because of laws that prevent the companies from buying group insurance for their drivers. There are competing bills in the Senate and the Assembly to allow such insurance, but details over the minimums required have been gumming up negotiations. As with most issues, conversations between parties were continuing over the weekend, though it is not yet clear if there will be a deal that the companies  which have pushed hard to expand  can abide.ETHICS Every year seems to be the year for real ethics reform in Albany. Until, of course, it is not. That said, 2016 was not just any year. It was closely preceded by the federal corruption convictions of two legislative leaders: the former Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican; and Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and longtime speaker of the Assembly. Both men were sentenced to substantial prison terms even as the session dragged on, but even that failed to produce a push for sweeping ethics laws.The lone point of agreement  until a new push from the governor last week  seemed to be bills to strip convicted lawmakers of their pensions, though even that has failed to pass both houses. The governors idea for more disclosure on outside groups seems to have some chance of becoming law, and common ground on pensions might still be found, too.But the bigger changes  such as closing the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows almost unchecked giving to political campaigns  will, like so many issues, have to wait until next year. Or beyond."}
{"text": "Joey Logano, 26, pulled away to win the FireKeepers Casino 400 on Sunday and was followed by Chase Elliott, 20, and Kyle Larson, 23, making up the youngest top three in history for a race on Nascars top series, now known as the Sprint Cup.The threes average age, 23, was lower than the 24.7 of the top three finishers at a race in 1951 and two races the previous year.The future of Nascar is present, Logano said. Its going to be big. Its amazing to see.Logano, the pole-sitter at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., passed Elliott on Lap 153 and stayed ahead for the 15th Sprint Cup Series victory of his career. Elliott finished a career-best second, but he was not in the mood to celebrate, blaming himself for poor restarts.I definitely messed up, he said. Putting it in the correct gear would be a good start.Brad Keselowski was fourth, and Kevin Harvick, the points leader, finished fifth.HAMILTON NARROWS GAP Lewis Hamilton took advantage of Sebastian Vettels pit-stop strategy to earn his 45th career Formula One win, capturing the Canadian Grand Prix for the fifth time. Vettel took the early lead in Montreal with an audacious move at the start, but he gave it back for good when he went to the pits  for the second time  on Lap 37.With the victory, Hamilton cut the series lead of his teammate Nico Rosberg to 9 points, from 24, at 116-107. Vettel moved into third in the points race, with 78.INDYCAR RACE RESCHEDULED The IndyCar driver Josef Newgarden broke his right collarbone in a scary crash in the Firestone 600 after his car was slammed to its side and slid along the frontstretch wall with the top of the cockpit exposed. Only 71 of the scheduled 248 laps in Fort Worth were completed before rain from an approaching thunderstorm hit the track, so IndyCar rescheduled the race for Aug. 27.Andy Murray said he was reuniting with his former coach Ivan Lendl, who helped Murray win his two Grand Slam titles, at the United States Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013. Since splitting with Lendl in March 2014, Murray has lost three Grand Slam finals, all to Novak Djokovic.Murray and Lendl parted ways after Lendl, an eight-time Grand Slam singles champion, decided he no longer wanted to spend 20-plus weeks a year traveling. Murray replaced Lendl with Amlie Mauresmo, who helped him climb back up the rankings after he had back surgery, but the partnership ended last month.AROUND TENNIS CoCo Vandeweghe beat Kristina Mladenovic, 7-5, 7-5, to win her second Ricoh Open title in The Hague, Netherlands. Vandeweghe also won the grass-court tournament in 2014  her only two titles on the WTA Tour.  Heavy rain forced organizers to push back until Monday the Mercedes Cup final between Dominic Thiem and Philipp Kohlschreiber with the first set tied, 6-6, in Stuttgart, Germany.Chicago Cubs Manager Joe Maddon is intrigued by the idea of pitchers, including his ace, Jake Arrieta, competing in the Home Run Derby.Maddon said he would not be worried that Arrieta would be hurt but stopped short of endorsing the idea on behalf of the team.Thats above my pay grade, right there, he said.Still, Maddon became more enthused about the idea as he mentioned the Diamondbacks Zack Greinke, the Dodgers Clayton Kershaw, and the Mets Jacob deGrom and Bartolo Colon as other National League pitchers who could compete.I think it would be interesting, Maddon said. It might even be more interesting than the regulars.The Giants Madison Bumgarner has said he would like to participate in the event, set for July 11 in San Diego during the All-Star break. On Saturday, Arrieta said he would want to match his home run power against Bumgarners.Arrieta said swinging for the fences in the Home Run Derby spotlight would probably be the most adrenaline I would ever have.Milestone for Hamels Cole Hamels became the seventh active pitcher to reach 2,000 strikeouts in the Texas Rangers 6-4 win against the host Seattle Mariners, joining C.C. Sabathia, Bartolo Colon, Felix Hernandez, Jake Peavy, John Lackey and Justin Verlander. Hamels struck out five and allowed one run on four hits in seven innings.AROUND THE MAJORS Dallas Keuchel, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, became the first major league pitcher to lose nine games this season as the visiting Houston Astros fell to the Tampa Bay Rays, 5-0.  Russell Martin hit a three-run homer, and the host Toronto Blue Jays used a season-high seven doubles to beat the Baltimore Orioles, 10-9.  Max Keplers first major league homer, a three-run shot in the 10th, gave the host Minnesota Twins a 7-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox.  Jon Lester earned his fourth straight win, allowing no earned runs in seven innings as the visiting Chicago Cubs beat the Atlanta Braves, 13-2.Bernhard Langer won the Constellation Senior Players Championship for the third straight year, making a 12-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a one-stroke victory at windy Philadelphia Cricket Club in Flourtown, Pa.Langer, a 58-year-old German, won his seventh senior major title  his fifth in the last 11  to tie Hale Irwin for second on the career list, one victory behind Jack Nicklaus.AROUND GOLF Daniel Berger won the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis for his first P.G.A. Tour title, shooting a three-under-par 67 to hold off Phil Mickelson, Steve Stricker and Brooks Koepka by three strokes.  Wu Ashun rallied to win the Lyoness Open in Atzenbrugg, Austria, for his second European Tour victory, improving his chances of playing for China in the Rio Olympics. Wu closed with a three-under 69 for a one-stroke win over Adrian Otaegui.  Bronte Law became the second player in Curtis Cup history to go 5-0, doing so in Britain and Irelands 11 -8  victory over the United States in Dublin.Chris Froome warmed up for the Tour de France by winning the Critrium du Dauphin stage race for the third time. Froomes other Dauphin wins were in 2013 and 2015  the years he also won the Tour, which starts July 2. Froome finished with a winning margin of 12 seconds over Romain Bardet. Alberto Contador finished fifth."}
{"text": "Last year at this time, the thoroughbred horse racing community and casual racing fans alike were riding the high of a milestone: American Pharoah had won the Belmont Stakes to become the first horse in 37 years to complete the Triple Crown.A year later, without the distraction of a Triple Crown or even a rematch between this years Kentucky Derby winner, Nyquist, and Exaggerator, the Preakness winner, the racing industry has had to look in the mirror. What it sees is still not pretty. The systemic problems that existed before the Triple Crown have not gone away. Horses are still dropping dead on the track as unscrupulous trainers, under pressure to produce, continue to administer harmful drugs, threatening the sports already fragile credibility.There has to be a correction, said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.Pacelle and I have spoken over the years about animal welfare and animal cruelty. In his recent book The Humane Economy: How Innovators and Enlightened Consumers are Transforming the Lives of Animals, Pacelle argues that businesses that do not adjust to consumer concerns about the treatment of animals are doomed.If a business is engaged in some sort of animal cruelty or animal mistreatment, its eventually going to catch up to them, he said.Some are starting to pay attention. Ringling Brothers retired its elephant herd last month after having had the animals as part of its traveling circus act for nearly 150 years. In March, SeaWorld announced that it would stop breeding orcas.The two biggest brand names have phased out or are phasing out the use of animals that are the center of their brands because of the animal welfare concerns, Pacelle said. Everything is changing, yet horse racing is still resisting reform. There has to be a correction.But thanks in part to social media, the casual fan, who tends to care about horse racing only in April, May and June (around the time of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont), is taking an active interest in how equine athletes are treated. Their concerns  along with the specter of death at the track, of still too many breakdowns, of widespread doping  are also compelling some forces within the industry to take steps toward real reform, beginning with doping.The powerful Jockey Club is working with the Humane Society to eliminate the scourge of doping and, in the process, get the fragmented racing industry to play by a single set of rules.The two groups are supporting federal legislation, the Thoroughbred Horse Racing Anti-Doping Act of 2015, that would put the United States Anti-Doping Agency in charge of monitoring the administration of race-day medication at the track. The organizations hope to put Usada, an independent agency, in a position to police the sports deeply rooted doping culture.Race-day doping is particularly troublesome. It can give horses an advantage, but it can also put already injured horses, who should not be racing, at risk of greater, even catastrophic, injury.It wont solve everything, but doping is the most insidious of the practices in racing, Pacelle said. It is Exhibit No. 1 for the idea that people are more concerned with winning than they are with the protection and welfare of the horses.The Jockey Club has taken polls over the last five years that show convincingly that racing fans are paying attention to aspects of the sport beyond simply wagering.They are concerned, said Jim Gagliano, the chief executive of the Jockey Club, with matters of animal welfare and the fairness and integrity of competition.He added: Those are very high among our current fans and potential new fans. It is good business for racing.There are many contentious issues in the sport: breeding horses for speed, for example, not endurance; sending poor and underperforming horses to slaughter. But this legislation is just about doping.You have to start somewhere, Pacelle said.The support from the Jockey Club, which, made up as it is of owners and breeders, is the closest thing racing has to central leadership, is an acknowledgment that the regulatory system in place to police doping could be substantially improved by Usadas oversight.For a sport that plays by 38 different sets of rules corresponding to the 38 racing commissions nationwide, a universal set of doping regulations would be a major accomplishment.Theres a collective recognition that the system thats in place, and has been in place for a long time, hasnt been adequate, hasnt been nimble enough, hasnt been uniform across all the racing states, Gagliano said.Pacelle and Gagliano will no doubt face fierce opposition from within racing.Some of the sports stakeholders dont want to reboot the process and surrender ome of their autonomy.Change is always hard for some to contemplate, Gagliano said. Others feel this is going to require a federal act, and they oppose federal intervention in our sport.But if horses keep dying on the track, breaking down and being exploited by race-day doping, the sport could find itself up to its neck in federal intervention, and deservedly so.The larger issue  the only issue, really  is the care of the animals.We write quite a bit about the danger of participating in high-risk sports and recreational pursuits. Human beings take risks, whether were jumping out of planes, climbing mountains, playing football or boxing. We go into them, more or less, with our eyes open. But race horses are involuntary participants in a tough sport; they need protection now more than ever.Bringing Usada into thoroughbred racing is the best idea in the sport in decades.Were not unlike any other sport, Gagliano said, except weve got a competitor  the horse  whose responsibility and welfare is really entrusted to us.From Eight Belles, who died at the end of the Kentucky Derby in 2008, to scores of others that died more anonymous, inglorious deaths on the track, the industry has abused its horses and the trust of its fans.With this legislation, racing can take a small step toward winning it back."}
{"text": "PARIS  The art dealer and billionaire David Nahmad says he is well aware of the scornful whispers that trail him when he travels to Brazil, to New York. He says he feels the disapproving stares when he enters his synagogue at home in Monaco.People say, Oh, David stole it; he should give it back immediately, Mr. Nahmad said in a rare interview at a hotel here.It is a valuable painting by Modigliani, an oil portrait of a dapper chocolate merchant in a hat and tie, seated and holding a cane. A Nahmad holding company bought the work at auction in 1996 and has owned it ever since. But the grandson of a Jewish antiques dealer says it is the same work that was confiscated from his relatives Paris shop during the Nazi occupation and sold off more than 70 years ago.For almost five years, the grandson, Philippe Maestracci, and a company specializing in recovering looted art have pressed a claim in New York state and federal courts for the work, once estimated to be worth as much as $25 million.Mr. Nahmad, the scion of a family of international art dealers, remains adamant that he will not settle. He is basing much of his stance on a French court record from 1947 that he says casts doubt on whether his painting is the same Modigliani that the antique dealer, Oscar Stettiner, tried to recover after World War II.The court paper, filed in connection with Mr. Stettiners 1946 claim to regain the painting, describes it as a Modigliani self-portrait, not an image of a chocolate merchant.But there is conflicting evidence cited by Mr. Maestracci, including the provenance listed when the Nahmad holding company unsuccessfully tried to sell the disputed painting, Seated Man With a Cane, through Sothebys in 2008.In its sale materials, the auction house listed Stettiner as a possible previous owner of the painting and said it had then been sold anonymously in Paris between 1940 and 1945.I think the evidence is overwhelming, James Palmer, whose Mondex Company is trying to reclaim the Modigliani painting for Mr. Maestracci, said in an interview from Italy.In recent months, much of the conversation over the work has focused not on the particulars of its provenance but on whether Mr. Nahmad went to great lengths to conceal his ownership. Technically, the painting is owned by the International Art Center, a holding company that controls many masterpieces, from Monets to Picassos, and has long been known as a Nahmad company by art world insiders.The International Art Center is me personally, said Mr. Nahmad, who said he uses it for security purposes to mask his name. Its David Nahmad.Nonetheless, for years, Mr. Nahmads representatives avoided making that direct connection in interviews. Much of the court battle over the Modigliani has revolved around whether the Art Center company is controlled by the Nahmads.But the recent leak of a trove from the so-called Panama Papers  showing documents from the Mossack Fonseca law firm, which set up the holding company  made clear that Mr. Nahmad was indeed its principal. The resulting publicity was ugly and overwhelming, Mr. Nahmad said.Looted art, hidden art  they made me look like a crook instead of doing real battle in the court, he said.In April a Swiss prosecutor, reacting to the disclosure, placed a legal hold on the work, which is in storage in Geneva, while he investigated whether the painting was stolen property. (Last month, he dropped the seizure order, citing insufficient evidence.)Wasnt it a mistake not to have been more transparent?Mr. Nahmad turned to his Swiss lawyer, Rodolphe Gautier, who said that when you are filing a lawsuit in New York you have to go against a proper defendant.No matter who is behind the International Art Center, he added, it really does not change the lawsuit.Mr. Nahmad, 69, has long loathed publicity, but he has changed his strategy. He hired a public relations firm and last week set up shop at a suite in the five-star Plaza Athne hotel here where he met individually with several reporters.A glass coffee table was piled high with Modigliani catalogs that Mr. Nahmad, in a casual blue sweater and slacks, thumbed through. They showed that he had lent the disputed painting to several museums, including the Jewish Museum in New York in 2004.If you had any doubt about looted art, would you really lend it to a Jewish museum? he asked.Mr. Palmer, of Mondex, says a series of documents demonstrate the Stettiner ownership of the work, including the catalog for the 1930 Venice Biennale where a portrait of a man by Modigliani was exhibited and credited to the collection of a Mr. Stettiner. The listing for a July 1944 sale by the French auction house Drouot, which sold items taken from Mr. Stettiner, records the sale of an unnamed Modigliani picture.The price was 16,000 francs, though, far too low, Mr. Nahmad says, for a large work in oil by Modigliani, even then. Today that price would be equal to almost 3,000 euros, or about $3,375.Mr. Nahmad said he feels his position has been strengthened by an obscure 1947 French court document located by his researcher in the Paris archives amid the files of the claim submitted by Mr. Stettiner. The document had been legally sealed until 2022, but Mr. Nahmad successfully applied for an exemption to examine it.The document is from a French bailiff who presided over Mr. Stettiners restitution case. In it, the bailiff refers to the painting as a picture representing the painter Modigliani painted by himself.But Mr. Palmer, who has seen the document, said he is not persuaded. The bailiff is not an art expert, he said. Its pretty easy for a bailiff to make that kind of mistake.With that impasse, Mr. Nahmad said he is poised to fight on in the courts.In the meantime, he is weighing invitations to exhibit his painting. He said he thinks the best option is to loan it to a museum in Israel. For now, he said, he has too many doubts to relinquish the painting.But he said, If its proven that this painting is looted by the Nazis, I will give it back."}
{"text": "Walgreens said on Sunday that it was terminating its relationship with Theranos, dealing a severe blow to the embattled blood-testing company. Walgreens said it would immediately close all 40 of the Theranos testing centers in its Arizona drugstores, the source of most of Theranoss customers.The giant retailer, a part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance, played a critical role in Theranoss early success. Founded by Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford University dropout, the company promised to revolutionize the lab industry by being able to offer blood tests through a simple finger prick at a fraction of the cost of conventional testing.But Theranos has run into a relentless barrage of negative publicity and regulatory scrutiny, and Walgreens has sought to extricate itself from its relationship with the Silicon Valley start-up. Federal officials identified serious problems at Theranoss flagship lab in California, causing Walgreens to halt testing done there in January. The 40 Arizona locations remained open while Walgreens awaited regulators final decision, which included whether to ban Ms. Holmes from the industry for two years.While regulators have not yet made a final determination, Walgreens appears to have lost patience.In light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has rejected Theranoss plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers best interests to terminate our partnership, Brad Fluegel, senior vice president of Walgreens, said in a company statement.Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Theranos, said the company would continue to do business using the stand-alone retail locations it is already running, apart from the Walgreen stores. It has five such locations in Arizona and one in California, and further expansion is planned for Arizona, she said.We are disappointed that Walgreens has chosen to terminate our relationship and remain fully committed to our mission to provide patients access to affordable health information, Theranos said in a statement.The statement went on: Quality and safety are our top priorities and we are working closely with government officials to ensure that we not only comply with all federal regulations but exceed them.Ms. Buchanan declined to comment beyond the companys statement.While Theranos might struggle along with its own retail units, clearly most of its customers came from the testing centers in Walgreens. Having easily accessible locations in corner drugstores was part of Theranoss grand plan to upend the laboratory testing business, and it had at one time said it eventually envisioned being in Walgreens drugstores nationwide.The announcement of the deal with Walgreens in September 2013 was also when Theranos made its existence known to the world, coming out of the stealth mode it had been in since being founded by Ms. Holmes in 2003.Walgreens hoped to add lab testing to its offering, drive traffic to its stores and pick up some of the cachet of being associated with a cutting-edge Silicon Valley start-up.This is the next step in Walgreens efforts to transform community pharmacy, giving our patients and customers convenient access to the comprehensive care they need right in their communities, Kermit Crawford, who was then Walgreens president for pharmacy, health and wellness, said at the time.The endorsement of Walgreens gave the unproven Theranos some credibility that it could perform numerous medical tests on a drop of blood rather than from tubes of blood drawn from an arm. Ms. Holmes became a celebrity whose worth was estimated at $4.5 billion, based on her half ownership of the privately held company.But it now appears that Walgreens did not adequately vet the technology. Government inspectors and articles in The Wall Street Journal have revealed that much of the companys testing was being done on standard machines bought from laboratory equipment vendors  the same machines used by Theranoss rivals.Moreover, Theranos did not even do those tests well, lacking experience and qualified personnel in the laboratory business. Federal inspectors have found numerous problems with operations at the companys flagship laboratory in Newark, Calif. They have threatened sanctions, which could include barring Ms. Holmes from owning a laboratory company for two years.Theranos recently voided the results from tens of thousand of tests and corrected the results of other tests. Forbes magazine, which compiles lists of the worlds wealthiest people, recently adjusted Ms. Holmess estimated net worth to zero.When the testing problems first came to light last fall, Walgreens halted expansion of Theranos testing sites beyond Arizona and asked the company for more information. The action announced on Sunday suggests the drugstore chain was not satisfied with the answers it received."}
{"text": "PARIS  The revelation that the 29-year-old man who opened fire on Sunday in a gay nightclub had dedicated the killing to the Islamic State has prompted a now-familiar question: Was the killer truly acting under orders from the Islamic State, or just seeking publicity and the groups approval for a personal act of hate?For the terror planners of the Islamic State, the difference is mostly irrelevant.Influencing distant attackers to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State and then carry out mass murder has become a core part of the groups propaganda over the past two years. It is a purposeful blurring of the line between operations that are planned and carried out by the terror groups core fighters and those carried out by its sympathizers.The attacker, Omar Mateen, told a 911 operator that he was pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. In the groups nomenclature, that pledge is a central part of the ISIS protocol. The Orlando killing was the third time the loyalty pledge was known to be invoked in the United States.In December when a couple in San Bernardino, Calif., left their home armed with assault rifles, they made sure to post their oath of allegiance on Facebook, where law enforcement agents later found it. And just minutes before he opened fire on a cartoon exhibit featuring images of the Prophet Muhammad in Texas in May 2015, Elton Simpson sent out a series of Twitter messages making clear where his allegiances lay.This public oath is about the only requirement that the Islamic State imposes on followers who wish to carry out acts of terror in its name. In an annual speech, the terror groups spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, last month incited its supporters to carry out killings abroad during the holy month of Ramadan.No attack is too small, he advised, specifically naming the United States as a target. The smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us, he said, and more effective and more damaging to them.As early as September 2014, Mr. Adnani made clear that anyone and everyone could, and should, carry out acts of terror in the groups name. Do not ask for anyones permission, he said, and suggested that sympathizers who could not buy weapons should instead use rocks, knives or even cars to kill infidels.Since then, the group has worked hard to create a mechanism for inciting terror in situ. It floods the internet with gory propaganda, and employs an army of keyboard jihadists to push the deadly message on Twitter, Facebook and other social media.In this case, there was a stark resonance between Islamic State propaganda and the killers choice of target. The jihadist group has publicized its hatred of homosexuals, including releasing images of fighters killing people suspected of being gay by throwing them off tall buildings.Once the recruit is caught, or killed, law enforcement officials struggle to put the pieces back together. Yet the fact that there is often no direct link back to the core is intended to protect the organization in an age of surveillance.I think what the Islamic State has done is very clever, and that is create a situation where someone can carry out an attack without any direct link to the organization, said Charlie Winter, senior research associate at Georgia State Universitys Transcultural Conflict and Violence Initiative. They can pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before or during, and that catapults them from being a self-starter jihadist guy, or girl, to someone who can be lionized as a soldier of the Islamic State and regarded as a warrior.On Sunday, after it was known that Mr. Mateen had invoked ISIS, the groups official news agency issued a bulletin quoting a source confirming that Mr. Mateen was acting on the Islamic States behalf.Jihadists erupted in celebration on the internet. They shared screenshots of Mr. Adnanis speech calling for lone wolf attacks during Ramadan. And in an act of tribute, several changed their profile pictures on Twitter to a photograph of the Orlando attacker."}
{"text": "Wilderness probably isnt the first word that pops into your mind when considering dances by the choreographer Brian Brooks. His work, which lives in a place of repetition and lines, moves bodies through space with serene calculation. A manicured forest perhaps, but nothing wild, nothing untamed. On Thursday at the Kitchen, he unveiled Wilderness as part of a season presented by the American Dance Institute. For Mr. Brooks, this exploration of fluidity  lugubrious, ponderous  offered little in the way of a change of course.Nevertheless, Mr. Brooks is on a roll: He was recently appointed the inaugural choreographer in residence at Chicagos Harris Theater for Music and Dance  hell earn $300,000 over three years  and he has also been commissioned to create works for the ballerina Wendy Whelan. His rise in the field is one of those dance-world puzzles. Wilderness, with its self-aware slickness, is largely bland and feels particularly out of place at the Kitchen, where some facet of risk-taking is expected.Set to Jerome Begins original score, which is played by Sandbox Percussion, Wilderness takes place in a two-sided white space; the four musicians, who wear pristine white suits and stand in a row to form the stages third side, mix live percussion with sounds of ripping paper and scribbling. Oddly, the music activates the space in a way that Mr. Brookss choreography does not. Odder still is the funereal way the dancers seem to defy the beat by drifting across the stage in slowly curving shapes that twist their bodies in one direction and then the next.After a while, the dancers weightless and slow-motion swaying, especially as they lean against one another and twirl away, is enough to induce queasiness. Rare moments when they react to the score  in one scene, they lie on their backs and lift and lower their hips with a brisk thud  are too obvious and feel like an exercise in composition class.Despite solos and a duet for Matthew Albert and Nate Buchsbaum, this eight-member cast, wearing Karen Youngs black short-sleeve tops and fitted pants, is somewhat anonymous. The uniform costumes give the dancers the look of an efficient sales staff. Even in Joe Levasseurs continually shifting lighting  which is more hectic than evocative as it dims, brightens and eventually bathes the stage in a rosy blush  Wilderness is as barren as a department store at opening time."}
{"text": "PASADENA, Calif.  The man who has guided Mexico to international soccers longest current unbeaten streak began his coaching career with a small club on Staten Island.That man, a Colombian immigrant named Juan Carlos Osorio, traveled to the United States in the 1980s, after injuries ended his playing career in South America, to attend college in Iowa. After one semester, he moved to New York, where he worked in construction and food-service jobs to support himself before attending Southern Connecticut State University. After graduating in 1990 with a degree in exercise science, Osorio worked as a personal trainer in Queens while playing for local club teams.By 1998, Osorio reached a crossroads. At 37, time was ticking on his dream. So Osorio took a risk by joining a local club, the Staten Island Vipers, as a conditioning coach.We could tell almost immediately that he would be very successful, because what set him apart from just about everyone was his professionalism and work ethic, said Adrian Gaitan, the Vipers coach at the time, who now guides a club in Spain.The Vipers competed in the A-League, the second level of American professional soccer at the time, behind Major League Soccer, but played their home games at Tottenville High School and Wagner College. Osorio devoured the opportunity.He took his job very serious and was always trying to better himself so he could better the people around him, Gaitan said. He was also one of the most competitive people you can be around. He had a great ability to relate to players, and I believe that being a former player helped him a lot.When the Vipers folded in 1999, Osorio contacted the MetroStars in M.L.S.Juan Carlos knocked on my door looking for an opportunity, said Octavio Zambrano, then the teams coach. I was looking for a bilingual trainer with experience. He was respectful and had the acumen to become a good assistant, but I needed to see his personality and ability to deal with professional players.So Zambrano took Osorio on the MetroStars preseason tour of Spain and Portugal to evaluate him.The players took an immediate liking to him because of his preparation for every session and his individual care for each one of them, said Zambrano, now the director of youth development for Club Deportivo El Nacional in Ecuador. By the time we got back to New York, he had earned his position.The traits refined during those early years set Osorio on a path toward four club championships and two domestic cups as a head coach  and defined a meticulous, intellectual, collective approach that has helped Mexico win or tie 21 successive games.Mexico will risk that streak Monday night in Houston against Venezuela at the Copa Amrica Centenario, with the victor finishing first in Group C.Since Osorio became Mexicos coach in October, the team has won nine consecutive games and allowed only one goal. Yet when he took the job  his first as any national teams coach  Osorio was criticized before his first game.I dont know how they came up with Osorio, but there are better coaches in Mexico, said Cruz Azul Coach Toms Boy, who played for Mexico in the 1986 World Cup.Hugo Snchez, one of Mexicos 12 coaches between 2006 and 2015, was asked whether Osorio deserved the position.If he were Mexican, yes, Snchez said. But since hes not Mexican, hed be the ideal coach for Colombias national team.Mexicos players, however, are learning to appreciate Osorios style.He knows a lot and he loves to study, said goalkeeper Alfredo Talavera, who called Osorio a soccer philosopher.Osorios philosophy leaves no room for the melodrama surrounding Mexicos national team.The most important thing is to gain the players confidence, because theyre the ones who have to implement what we plan, he said. I knew it was going to take time. In fact, I still have the responsibility to inculcate in the players the way we want them to work.Osorios attention to detail extends to arranging and rearranging training cones himself. He directs players with a notebook he fills with detailed, color-coded comments. He emphasizes collective effort, especially when selecting Mexicos lineup.The national team is involved in a lot of games, and theres not a lot of time for training, Osorio said. Its more a matter of having a defined strategy. Its a matter of trying to identify who complements whom in what scenario. In a group like this that has multifaceted players, we see how they interact with each other as a group.Osorios methods reflect his postgraduate education in Britain, which accelerated his career. In 2001, Osorio left the MetroStars to obtain a degree from Liverpool John Moores University in a unique major: science and football. While pursuing his degree, he often observed Liverpool F.C.s training sessions from outside a fence at the clubs Melwood training center.I remember talking to him before he left for England and told him I thought he was crazy, Gaitan said. He was going there to spend a year and take a coaching course. He ended up taking the course watching training sessions, I believe, from his apartment, and eventually working his way into the Liverpool facility.Osorios persistence led to a four-year stay at Manchester City, where he rose from trainer to assistant coach. In 2006, the Colombian club Millonarios gave Osorio his first head coaching job. A year later, Osorio returned to M.L.S. to guide the Chicago Fire, which promptly surged from last place to the playoffs in half a season.Yet in December 2007, Osorio resigned to return to New Jersey as coach of the renamed Red Bulls, who reached the 2008 M.L.S. championship game. But after the Red Bulls lost 16 of their first 22 M.L.S. matches in 2009, Osorio resigned that August.Colombias Once Caldas, where Osorio once played, provided his next job and his first league championship in 2010. But Osorio made his biggest impact when he guided Medellns Atltico Nacional to three league championships and two domestic cups between 2012 and 2014.After firing Miguel Herrera last July, Mexico lured Osorio away from his post at So Paulo F.C. in Brazil.I guess my whole career is different from anybody else, Osorio told an interviewer in May. Now when I look back, probably the hardest and most important decision was being 23, playing professional football in Colombia and saying to myself: No, this is not good enough. I have to go prepare myself to be the best coach I can be. I need to go start from scratch.From that decision, he built a career. With Mexico, Osorio built a team that could become the first from outside South America to win the Copa.He started out being a fitness coach, and look how he has evolved, Gaitan said. Not many people have that kind of passion and desire to do what he did. He deserves everything that comes his way, and we all take a little pride in the fact that his success started with us."}
{"text": "An Afghan-American Muslim walks into a gay club in Florida on Latin night during Pride Month. In my dreams, that is the beginning of another great story of remix, tolerance and coexistence that is possible only in America. In reality, its the start of a nightmare massacre fueled by hatred and perpetrated by a man from a group already scarred by a generation of suspicion and surveillance.Whether Omar Mateen was a militant fighter financed by the Islamic State, a self-radicalized extremist or a lone wolf psychopath with a gun license, the distinction for committing the worst mass shooting in our history now belongs to an American Muslim.After the attacks in Orlando early Sunday morning, many of my American Muslim friends began posting messages on Facebook about how frustrating it felt to go from the affirming images of the late Muhammad Ali to news of yet another terrorist attack. He doesnt represent us, many wrote. He cant call himself a Muslim. For many American Muslims, this kind of immediate condemnation and social media activism has become the first step in our symbiotic relationship with the news cycle. As the history of fellow minorities has taught us, retaliatory violence, exclusion and even internment are always possible in the American family and its best to try to get ahead of the curve.But in this moment of hashtag solidarity, I hope we can also have some tough conversations about our limits. Accompanying those posts, I saw many gestures of solidarity and sympathy for the L.G.B.T. community. But behind those posts is a history of silence on gay rights.For eight years, I was an editor and producer for NPRs All Things Considered. It seemed as if each week featured an example of Muslim violence and with it an opportunity to bring more nuanced perspectives and context to the discussion. Through highlighting the voices of Muslim reformists and liberals, I felt optimistic about a generation that could bridge our widening divisions. But in my personal life, I was struggling in isolation with how to reconcile my own faith with my sexuality.When I was growing up, there were no Muslim role models or blueprints for taking a different path to love. When it came to the breakthroughs for gay rights in the Obama era, even progressive Muslims were mostly ambivalent. An open letter by the religious scholar Reza Aslan and the comedian Hasan Minhaj supporting same-sex marriage prompted handwringing and arguments in my newsfeed. Islam teaches us to be accepting but it is best for homosexuals to be celibate. What is wrong is wrong, someone wrote.For so many in the Muslim community, traditional marriage is a tenet of faith. Weddings, engagement parties and family picnics constitute our safe spaces. Although weve shared political goals like the protection of civil rights with L.G.B.T. activists in this age of terrorism, ours is not a natural or a deep alliance. More important, queer Muslims are marginalized if not simply invisible. In light of this weekends attacks, we can no longer afford this kind of superficial engagement.No religion has a monopoly on homophobia. The track record of exclusion and outright abuse of gay men and women in the name of God is a depressing reality across faiths. But we cannot use those analogies to excuse our own shortcomings. Omar Mateen went on a rampage at a gay club out of hatred he attributed to his faith. He shot and massacred Americans for thriving in their safe space, for being among those they love and were loved by, and he did it during both Ramadan and a Pride Month that epitomizes self-love in the face of hate. The toxic cocktail of gun violence, unchecked mental illness and deranged ideology that propelled the massacre at Pulse is a threat to all Americans.We must stand up against the anti-Muslim responses that come so easily in this current political climate. But for Muslims, this is also a moment to reflect more deeply on how we feel about living in a country where gay rights are central, where marriage equality is real and coexistence is the only way forward.As I look at his narcissistic selfies and brooding poses on the cable news loop, I dont know if Omar Mateen was mentally ill or just emotionally unhinged. I dont know if it was the sight of two gay men kissing that infuriated him to the point of massacre. What I do know is that there will be more dark days to come if we dont build the psychological, political and spiritual space within our communities to embrace the remixes that are possible only in this country."}
{"text": "PARIS  Gauthier Charrier, a graphic design student, stepped inside one of Pariss newest bookstores and wondered, Where are all the books?I saw this empty, open space  just a couple of stools  and I wondered, Did someone mess up? Mr. Charrier, 20, said.No one messed up.The pronounced stock shortage inside the Librairie des Puf, run by the publisher University Press of France, or Les Puf for short, is not the result of an ordering mistake, but the heart of the shops business model.There are books, but they are not delivered in advance from wholesalers. They are printed on request, before the customers very eyes, on an Espresso Book Machine. On Demand Books, the American company that manufactures the machine, chose the name as a nod to an activity you can complete in the five minutes it takes to print a book: Have a quick coffee.Labeled, not so modestly, the Gutenberg press of the 21st century by its creators, the machine sits in a back corner of the shop, humming as it turns PDFs into paperbacks. Customers use tablets to select the titles for print  adding, if they want to, their own handwritten inscriptions  while sipping coffee in the light and airy storefront in the Latin Quarter of Paris. The customers are all surprised, said the shops director, Alexandre Gaudefroy. At first, theyre a little uncomfortable with the tablets. After all, you come to a bookshop to look at books. But thanks to the machine and the tablets, the customer holds a digital library in their hands.From a business standpoint, Mr. Gaudefroy said, I dont have to worry about space for the stock. Were in a space which measures less than 80 meters squared, and I can offer readers as many titles as I want. And that is a lot of titles. All 5,000 books published by Les Puf are available, as well as an additional three million books compiled by On Demand Books, including titles from 10 large American publishers and the public domain.Les Pufs prestige in the industry has helped it secure even more titles  a group of French publishers are expected to hand over PDFs of their titles in a few weeks. Whats really exciting is that, thanks to the on-demand model, we can revive old titles, which we previously hadnt bothered with because theyd only sell five or 10 copies in a year, Mr. Gaudefroy said. On-demand, its a new economy for us.About 2,000 out-of-print Puf titles will be made available to customers in the coming months, Mr. Gaudefroy said. Were completely revising the chain of book production because were a bookseller, a publisher, a printer and also a distributor, he said.It is a radical reinvention of a store that first opened its doors in 1921. The original Librairie des Puf occupied a far larger, multilevel space in the corner of Place de la Sorbonne, and had packed window displays and a bustling intellectual crowd from nearby universities. It was long a cultural and academic symbol, until it was forced to close because of falling profits and soaring rents. Then, about 10 years ago, the site was sold to a mens-clothing chain, much to the chagrin of locals.But its closing was no exception. From 2000 to 2014, 28 percent of Paris bookstores closed, according to a 2015 report from the Paris Urban Planning Agency, a body assembled by the City Council in 1967 to chart social and economic evolution in the French capital. Crippling rent increases in Pariss densely populated center were mostly to blame, as well as growing competition from e-commerce sites that are able to offer far more titles than a cramped city bookstore. The decline in sales of newspapers and magazines also contributed, since these are often sold alongside books in French bookstores.The Latin Quarter, which has the highest concentration of bookshops in the city, was among the worst-hit areas. In an effort to protect the neighborhoods unique character  and prevent so-called blandification  the Paris City Council in 2008 made it the center of its VitalQuartier program. The program buys retail spaces across Paris, renovates them and rents them to small culturally significant enterprises at far below market rates. Les Puf was leased one of these spaces on Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, allowing it to reopen in March just a few blocks from where it closed.Were already thinking about opening in other big cities in France  in university towns like Lille, Bordeaux and Lyon, Mr. Gaudefroy said. After a few weeks of business, theres a real commercial motivation for doing so because, well, were selling a lot of books. A lot more than predicted. We thought wed sell 10, 15 books in a day, but its been more like 30 or 40.Its an investment, but if its well managed, it can be very profitable, Mr. Gaudefroy said. Along with the low rent for its retail space and the elimination of the cost of overproducing books that may not sell, Les Puf benefits from an affordable two-year lease on the Espresso Book Machine from the French printing association Ireneo. And Frances fixed-book pricing law, which prohibits anyone from selling books at a discount, means Les Puf can charge the price set by the publisher for each book. A lot of publishers I know are interested in the idea, especially when we tell them how little it costs us, Mr. Gaudefroy said.So far, the store has relied on foot traffic and the pull of the machines novelty to draw customers, but a social media and leafleting campaign aimed at students  Les Pufs original demographic  is planned.Les Pufs success is not an anomaly. Times are still tough for brick-and-mortar shops, but signs of a recovery are widespread. In the United States, sales in physical bookstores rose by 2.5 percent last year, the first increase since 2007. In Britain, the largest chain bookseller, Waterstones, announced a return to profitability at the end of last year after the arrival of the indie book-selling success story James Daunt as managing director.Mr. Daunt decentralized control of the chains 275 stores, encouraging individual managers to modify their stores layouts for the local book-buying audience, thus scrapping an ingrained industry practice that had effectively allowed publishers to dictate which books appeared in best-seller sections.Independent bookstores, too, are beginning to carve a path out of their businesss decade of decline. Its an industry which is very much starting to rebound, said Nick Brackenbury, one of the founders of NearSt, a mobile application created in London that is helping to wean customers off buying books on Amazon.com, encouraging them to return instead to their local stores.Bookshops are starting to do lots of little innovative things and getting people to come back into them, Mr. Brackenbury said. For many bookstores that have the space, like Gogol & Company in Milan, La Fugitiva in Madrid and Java Bookshop in Amsterdam, remaking themselves as hybrid bookstore-coffee shops has become a reliable way to attract customers. Other shops are emphasizing something unavailable online  the experience of visiting a bookstore.The Society Club in Londons Soho district is as much a cocktail club and members lounge as a bookstore. Books for Cooks  a store in Notting Hill entirely devoted to cookbooks  offers a sensory experience by cooking up one of its books many recipes in an open kitchen at the back of the store every morning.Mr. Brackenbury and his team are allowing bookstores to innovate on a more fundamental level: convenience. The main feedback we get from our users is: I buy from Amazon reluctantly because its so easy, he said. Everyone will say, I want to support my local shops. But few people actually do today because its so much hard work.NearSt aims to help local shops adapt to the needs of the modern customers by making local shop inventories shoppable from a smartphone, allowing customers to search for titles, find local stores that sell them and see routes there. We just want local stores to be able to offer customers something which is just better than Amazon, Mr. Brackenbury said."}
{"text": "SHANGHAI  An explosion in the check-in area of Shanghais Pudong International Airport injured at least four people on Sunday, according to the police and airport authorities, who said the blast was set off by a man carrying a homemade explosive.The airport is one of Chinas busiest, and travelers described fearful moments in the early afternoon when sharp cracking sounds reverberated through the Terminal 2 departure area and plumes of smoke rose to the ceiling, according to local news media and video footage.The police quickly cordoned off the area of the explosion, but the airport remained open, suggesting that officials were confident the episode was not part of a wider attack.The police said in a written statement that a man with a homemade explosive had removed it from his backpack and dropped it in front of a check-in counter. The statement indicated that the explosive was contained in a beer bottle or bottles.After the blast, the man also took a knife from the backpack and slashed his own throat and fell to the ground, the police said. The man survived but was said to be in grave condition.In addition, a nearby hospital took in four casualties of the explosion who were lightly wounded by bottle fragments, the police said. One was a citizen of the Philippines.By late Sunday afternoon, the airport was calm. Twelve of the next 18 flights scheduled to land were listed as delayed for as long as four hours. The cavernous departure hall of Terminal 2 was operating across two-thirds of its length, but Aisle C, where the explosion occurred, was roped off, and uniformed security personnel with black assault rifles slung over their shoulders stood guard, making it difficult to see any damage.Chinas Communist Party leadership prides itself on maintaining absolute control, and even relatively minor disruptions of that control can prompt an intense response. Hangzhou, a city near Shanghai, is scheduled to host a summit meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies in September.None of the reports gave any details about the suspect or his motives.The episode was not the first apparent breach of security of its kind at a Chinese airport. In 2013, a man set off a homemade explosive at Beijing International Airport to protest what he said was lack of redress after security guards in southern China beat him in 2005, leaving him paralyzed and using a wheelchair. The man, Ji Zhongxing, was sentenced to six years in prison."}

{"text": "Join us for live updates and analysis.The worst mass shooting in United States history did little to halt the politicking of the 2016 presidential election. If anything, in some respects, it accelerated it.Fifty people died in the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and the suspect, who was born in the United States to immigrants from Afghanistan, was reported to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama called the shooting both an act of terror and an act of hate, and he postponed an appearance with Hillary Clinton scheduled for Wednesday in Wisconsin.Mrs. Clinton issued a statement after the president spoke, offering similar thoughts and condolences to the victims and their families and a quick plea to curtail the availability of guns, before concluding, This is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country.Donald J. Trump took a different tack. Mr. Trump offered prayers for the victims, but he swiftly criticized Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama throughout the day. He also posted praise for himself on Twitter for his call for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Must be tough, Mr. Trump wrote in one post, calling for Mr. Obama to resign in another post for not using the phrase radical Islamic terrorism.Mr. Trumps proposed ban would not have prevented this attack; the suspect was a United States citizen. Still, Mr. Trump is forging ahead with a speech on Monday that had been about Mrs. Clinton, but will now focus on national security.Mrs. Clinton had plans to deliver a speech condemning Mr. Trump as a demagogue, but she is now expected to broaden it toward national security.Nearly four years ago, when a gunman killed 12 people in Aurora, Colo., Mr. Obama halted his campaign, and Mitt Romney, then the Republican nominee, canceled a speech. The nature and tenor of national politics has changed a great deal since then."}
{"text": "Earlier this month, chef Corey Lee strolled through the ground floor of the newly reopened SFMOMA, past one of Richard Serras swirling, imposing sculptures, and said: Whether we like it or not, food has started to occupy a new role as art. Its a statement that underlies every aspect of Lees new restaurant in the museum, where he will serve not only as chef, but also curator: When it opens tomorrow, In Situ will be a first-of-its kind gallery where diners can order faithfully replicated dishes from restaurants the world over, past and present.There might not be a better person for the job than Lee. He is one of the greatest chefs to have come out of Thomas Kellers kitchens and has earned three Michelin stars at his own restaurant Benu, just across the street from the museum. In the foreword to the Benu cookbook, the Momofuku chef and Lucky Peach editor David Chang expresses awe at his peer: Theres no better cook technician on the planet  Rarely do you come across the super-talented person who is matched with a superior work ethic. When you do, you get a supernova.Since getting the green light for the idea, Lee has had to tap into that work ethic and technique perhaps more than ever, traveling the world and learning how to cook a range of dishes, from Changs spicy pork sausage rice cakes (served at Momofuku Ssam Bar, in New York) to a braised octopus and seaweed by chef Virgilio Martinez (served at the restaurant Central, in Lima). As curator, Lees also had to count on the trust of each person lending their dish to the menu: You put together an exhibition based on relationships, he said. These are not interpretations. My cooks and I are shepherds of these chefs works. Befitting an exhibition, the menu lists the chef and restaurant responsible for each dish, as well as the year it was produced. It also includes descriptions  cogent as the finest museum labels  of each chefs contribution to gastronomy.The opening menu will feature 25 dishes, but Lee has amassed a repertoire of 90, with the intention of changing things up often. He envisions an accessible environment, where museumgoers can stumble upon the restaurant and order from the snack menu in the front of the space, or sit down for a full dinner in the main dining room. Imagine someone who had no idea they would discover this place coming in, and ordering something, Lee said. You can help them reimagine something about the world, or evoke an emotion they didnt plan on experiencing. Theres an amazing opportunity to surprise people."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  Lawmakers say Washington is dithering while a dangerous epidemic threatens American shores. They suggest darkly that the government is playing down the risk to avoid panic. They warn: Dont wait for it to arrive at the airports and establish a perilous foothold.Fear of the Zika virus today? No, those were Republicans in 2014 as they hammered the Obama administration in the final weeks of the midterm campaign for failing to react quickly and decisively enough to the possible spread of the Ebola virus, which never really became a domestic threat. The politically heated attacks cooled quickly after the election, but the message was credited with helping Republicans sow unease about the administration as they chalked up big wins in Congress.Now it is the Republican-led Congress moving slowly on providing money to combat the spread of Zika, alarming some lawmakers who fear that their colleagues do not recognize the potential consequences if the mosquito-borne disease begins to spread in the United States.There is just a lack of urgency about it, said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who added that lawmakers could find themselves facing difficult questions about a flat-footed congressional Zika response as Election Day looms this fall.People are going to be asking, Why didnt you do anything? he said in an interview. You are going to have to have a pretty good answer, and I am not sure there is going to be one.Mr. Rubio has a special interest in the disease, given that the climate and conditions in his state are well known for breeding mosquitoes. He worries that even the smallest of outbreaks could send his states economy into a spiral as visitors stay away.I tell people we are one mosquito-borne infection away from serious damage to our tourism industry, he said.He has not been alone in clamoring for a federal fix. In February, President Obama asked Congress for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds to step up prevention efforts and speed a vaccine for the disease, which has been linked to serious birth defects and other health problems.Last week  almost four months later  the Senate voted to begin negotiations to try to resolve differences among the House, Senate and White House approaches. Democrats are demanding a resolution by the Fourth of July recess, but there is no guarantee that the funding legislation can be completed by then.I just think theyre long overdue, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said last week. An emergency bill could have passed  were over 100 days since the request. She noted that the public health community could have been well down the road to what needs to be done in terms of prevention, in terms of research and the other aspects of stopping the epidemic.The issue is particularly grating at the White House, which came under siege in October 2014 over what Republicans called a lack of preparedness for Ebola. The administration believes it was unfairly maligned for political purposes by Republicans who saw an opening to make voters anxious close to the election. Mr. Obama said recently that he was having difficulty squaring Republicans position on Ebola with their much more casual approach to Zika, given that I have, at least, pretty vivid memories of how concerned people were about Ebola.Republicans say there is no need for a furious rush since the administration agreed in April to redirect nearly $590 million, most of it previously allocated for Ebola prevention, to the effort against Zika, easing the pressure to act quickly. Some Democrats now think that move, perhaps wise from a policy and prevention standpoint, may have been a strategic mistake because it let Republicans off the hook.I think we are fine, said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, predicting that Republicans had done what they needed to avoid a political backlash. He said that shifting the money had provided public health experts with the resources they needed and that the necessary funds will be there in the end.Negotiators working on a compromise are expected to move toward the $1.1 billion approved by the Senate as opposed to $622 million allocated by the House. Mr. Rubio and others favor providing the full amount sought initially by the White House.As of last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified nearly 700 Zika infections in the continental United States, though all appeared to have been contracted elsewhere. More than 1,000 have been counted in Puerto Rico. Public health experts are now preparing for the first case of someones being infected by a mosquito in the United States.Mr. Rubio worries that the federal response has fallen too far behind.I think in some ways we are already too late, he said. It takes time to get this implemented. Every day that goes by is wasted.As they try to hold on to control of the House and Senate, Republicans should hope that Mr. Rubio is wrong and that the disease does not become a crisis in the United States. If it does, it could be Democratic attacks on Republicans for moving too slowly that go viral."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof spotlights Americas harsh and irrational criminalization of poverty in Is It a Crime to Be Poor? (column, June 12). Unfortunately, criminalizing poverty and homelessness is a growing national trend.A report from the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty that surveyed 187 cities in 2014 shows that although most cities do not provide shelter for the homeless, 53 percent criminalize sitting or lying down in certain public places; 43 percent ban sleeping in a vehicle; and 9 percent even make it a crime to share food with homeless people.Despite federal court decisions prohibiting the criminalization of such activities, these local laws are increasingly prevalent. Criminalizing poverty and homelessness doesnt solve any underlying problem, and in fact makes the situation worse and wastes community public resources that could be used to address the underlying causes of poverty and homelessness.Instead of criminalization, we need to focus on proven solutions like providing stable housing and medical and mental health care to those in need.BOBBY WATTSExecutive DirectorCare for the HomelessNew York"}
{"text": "Q. Can you tell me how Wi-Fi Assist works and does it use my iPhone data?A. Apples Wi-Fi Assist feature is designed to keep your iPhone or cellular-model iPad connected to the internet even when the devices connection to a wireless network is weak or unstable. To keep the connection, the Wi-Fi Assist function (available on the iPhone 5 and later) automatically switches to your devices cellular connection. So, yes, the feature does consume part of the monthly data allowance you receive from your phone carrier.Wi-Fi Assist does not use the backup connection from your cellular plan for everything. It does not kick in for apps that stream or download large files, and it does not enable itself automatically if you are traveling and data-roaming on other carriers networks. Wi-Fi Assist is supposed to work for apps actively running, not programs that may periodically download new content in the background.When iOS 9 was released last fall, Wi-Fi Assist was turned on by default and caused much dismay from users with limited data plans whose monthly allowances were chewed up when the device automatically switched to the cellular signal for extended periods. If you are worried about conserving the data allowance doled out by your cellular carrier, you can turn off Wi-Fi Assist and other bandwidth-hogging apps in the iPhones settings.To do that, open the iPhones Settings icon from the Home screen, select Cellular and scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see Wi-Fi Assist. Tap the button next to it to disable the feature. In iOS 9.3 and later, the Wi-Fi Assist setting shows how much cellular data it has used, which can be helpful if you want to use the feature to stay online but want to keep an eye on the data meter."}
{"text": "The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is no stranger to  violence.From the 1969 police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York City that set off riots and helped touch off the modern gay-rights movement to the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard to near-epidemic levels of violence against transgender women, the community has been marked by flashes of trauma.After the massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Fla., that left 49 dead and 53 others injured, Richard Kim, the executive editor of The Nation, wrote on Sunday that gay bars and clubs have often been sanctuaries. And sometimes those sanctuaries have come under siege.Here are a few significant examples.Thirty-two people died when a fire swept through the UpStairs Lounge, a gay bar in the French Quarter, on June 24, 1973. After the blaze, some churches refused to bury the victims. The arsonist was never caught.It was horrible, Arthur Lambert, a firefighter who responded to the blaze, said in a video interview in 2013. These people, they were literally roasted alive.The New Orleans Times-Picayune wrote in 2013 that the lounge was not just any bar, but as a gay community hangout where locals could gather without fear of social persecution at a time of intense anti-gay stigma.Five people were injured when a bomb exploded at a lesbian bar, the Otherside Lounge, in February 1997. A second, unexploded, bomb was later found outside.It was one of four attacks by Eric Rudolph, a right-wing extremist, who also bombed two abortion clinics and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where one person died and 111 more were injured. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2005.Mr. Rudolph (who has a gay brother) said in a statement during his sentencing that he did not mind homosexuality that remained private. But he said any attempt to drag this practice out of the closet and have society accept it should be ruthlessly opposed.A former Marine shot and killed Danny Overstreet, 43, and injured six others in the Backstreet Cafe in Roanoke, Va., in 2000. The gunman, Ronald Edward Gay, 53, opened fire when he saw two men in the bar hug each other.When it happened, I was not out to my family, Joel Tucker, who was shot in the back during the rampage, told The Washington Post last year. I was not out to my job. I wasnt out to anybody except my very close friends.Mr. Gay, who told the police he was on a mission to kill gay people, said he was upset that his last name had made him the target of anti-gay jokes. He was sentenced to four life terms in 2001.Musab Mohammed Masmari, 30, poured gasoline on the stairs of a gay club and set it alight shortly after midnight on New Years Eve. More than 700 people were in the club at the time, including much of the citys gay and transgender leadership, but no one was hurt.Mr. Masmari pleaded guilty to arson and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in July 2014. He told the court that he could not remember setting the fire because he had blacked out after drinking an entire bottle of whiskey.The Stonewall Inn played a central role in the modern gay rights movement, but it has also seen antigay and anti-transgender violence in recent years.Two men attacked another man in the restroom in 2010 after he informed them that they were in a gay bar. The assailants were arrested, and one was later charged with hate crimes.The reality is, if people are looking to perpetrate anti-gay bias and violence, there are very few places in this world that are safe once that intent has formed, Sharon Stapel, the former executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said at the time of the attack.In March this year, a transgender woman said she was sexually assaulted in the unisex restroom."}
{"text": "United States and global stocks fell for a third day on Monday, as concerned investors waited to see what the Federal Reserve would do with interest rates later this week and anxiously awaited Britains decision on membership in the European Union.LinkedIn shares jumped after Microsoft announced plans to buy the company.The Standard & Poors 500-stock index fell 17.01 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,079.06 and the Nasdaq composite fell 46.11 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,848.44.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 132.86 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,732.48.The Federal Reserves two-day meeting will start on Tuesday, and a decision on interest rates is expected Wednesday afternoon. The central banks chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to hold a news conference after the interest rate decision.For months, the Fed had said that once economic data showed a consistently healthy economy, it would be time to resume raising interest rates. But after the government issued a surprisingly bleak hiring report for May, most Fed-watchers predicted the next rate increase would be put off until the fall.On Wednesday, the Fed is expected to echo the message Ms. Yellen sent in a speech last week: While the United States economy looks fundamentally solid and higher rates will come eventually, too many uncertainties exist.Among them is a June 23 referendum in Britain, nicknamed Brexit, over whether to leave the European Union. A yes vote could roil financial markets, and the Fed is unlikely to want to further unnerve investors with a rate increase just a week before that vote.Some recent polls have shown that a majority of British voters are in favor of exiting the E.U.Given the interest in Brexit, this weeks Fed meeting feels like a bit of a sideshow, said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at RBS, in a note to investors.Economists who foresee no rate increases before September say the Fed will not have a clear enough picture of the economy before then. The biggest uncertainty is whether the job market has succumbed to a prolonged slump or is merely enduring a brief pause. Other economic barometers have also sowed doubts, like tepid consumer spending and stresses from China and other major economies.While the global economy has stabilized in the sense that it is not dropping like a rock, global economic growth remains anemic at best, said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. Given all the uncertainties on economic growth and continued low inflation, there is no need to rush to hike interest rates.However, the Fed does not want to lead investors to inflate the prices of stocks and other assets out of a mistaken belief that it will keep rates ultralow well into the future. The need to discourage such excessive risk-taking is why even analysts who think the economy still faces challenges predict that the Fed will nevertheless raise rates at least once this year.The Fed wants to keep markets feet to the fire, but they do not want to hike rates so much that they exacerbate an economic slowdown, said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tufts University. They want to turn the crank slowly.The uncertainty over the Feds plans could be seen on Monday in bonds and the dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.61 percent from 1.64 percent on Friday, its lowest yield so far this year. The dollar, while off its lows, is still trading near its lows for the year against other major currencies.Brexit, combined with the weight of the Fed decision, kept stocks in Europe under pressure. The DAX in Germany closed down 1.8 percent, the CAC-40 in France fell 1.9 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 1.2 percent.Shares of the professional social networking site LinkedIn soared $61.13, or 47 percent, to $192.21 after Microsoft announced it was purchasing the company for $26.2 billion in cash. Shares of Microsoft fell $1.34, or 2.6 percent, to $50.14 after the deal was announced.Twitter shares jumped as well, up 53 cents, or 4 percent, to $14.55 on speculation that LinkedIns buyout could mean better buyout prospects for that social media service.The security software company Symantec jumped 91 cents, or 5 percent, to $18.21 after it said it would purchase another security company, Blue Coat, for $4.6 billion. Blue Coat had plans to go public later this year. Symantec was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500.In currencies, the dollar fell to 106.21 yen from 106.79 yen. The dollar fell slightly against the euro to $1.1291 and rose slightly against the British pound to $1.423.United States crude fell 19 cents, to $48.88 a barrel. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell 19 cents, to $50.35 a barrel in London. Oil prices had reached 11-month highs in the last few days.In other energy commodities, heating oil was effectively unchanged at $1.515 a gallon.

{"text": "Dannel Schwartz was agonizing over his wifes 60th birthday gift when she proposed an idea herself.She said, You know, I dont want to wait on another T.S.A. line. I want a private plane, said Mr. Schwartz, a retired rabbi who splits time between Florida and Maine. We laughed. Then comes this email about how it would cost $4 a flight.Intrigued by the all-you-can-fly model offered by BlackJet, the couple in March paid $15,000 for a membership that would allow them cheap seats on private jets with empty spots, scheduling their first trip for the weekend of April 30.But it quickly became clear that the Schwartzes would not be making the flight to New York. The company stalled when Mr. Schwartz tried to confirm the flight a few days before it was scheduled.A few days later came even worse news in an email from BlackJet.It is with great regret and personal disappointment that I need to report the following, wrote the companys chief executive, Dean Rotchin. Recent events have resulted in abruptly ceasing BlackJet operations.The Schwartzes $15,000 was gone. They said they had wired the money to the company, which told the couple it was no longer accepting credit cards.Not even one trip, said Mr. Schwartz, 70. Its embarrassing to go through this.The Schwartzes experience is a warning to travelers considering start-ups that offer relatively inexpensive access to private jets, once out of reach to the average customer. New companies pop up frequently, many with apps that allow travelers to book seats in minutes. But not all of them will survive.BlackJet was founded in 2012 and aimed to apply the Uber model to private jets. It was backed by a founder of Uber, Garrett Camp, and celebrities like Ashton Kutcher. But about a year after it began, it laid off staff and suspended service. It later shifted to the membership model, which allowed customers to find unused seats on nearby jets. That is what enticed the Schwartzes, who found that travelers who join can be on the line for thousands of dollars.In his email to clients last month, Mr. Rotchin said inaccurate bad press had caused BlackJets sudden closing, a reference to a TechCrunch article in April that incorrectly reported that the company had expired, which dented membership sales. He also blamed delays in short-term and long-term financing.But in an interview late last month, he said the collapse happened mainly because a BlackJet official who was crucial to operations left the company, though he would not name the executive.Mr. Rotchin acknowledged that the private jet business was inherently risky and said that the company stopped accepting credit cards late last year because of high fees.Everybody knew when they signed up that there would be no refunds, he said. There is some risk when you pay upfront for anything.Another company, Beacon, shut down this year after finding that its membership-based, all-you-can-fly model for private flights between New York and Boston was not sustainable.For travelers looking into private jet services, Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst and consultant, suggests considering companies that have a history and own their own planes, as opposed to BlackJet, which acted as a broker, matching travelers with empty seats. Several major or developing players  some of which have evolved since their founding  have their own fleets, including the 10-year-old XOJet and the 2013 start-up Surf Air.Too many start-ups are playing fast and loose with both safety and finances, said Mr. Mann, citing the 2005 crash of a Platinum Jet plane at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Federal authorities said the accident, which led to several felony convictions, illustrated the need for better oversight of charter companies.It really is the Wild West, Mr. Mann said, referring to recent charter jet accidents in Massachusetts and Ohio.Executives who have tried  and sometimes failed  to democratize private aviation are not giving up. Mr. Rotchin first tried out the plane-hailing concept with Greenjets, which fell into financial trouble and reorganized, becoming BlackJet. He is now considering his next move, but he said he realized that failures like these raise investors skepticism and make it more difficult for start-ups to raise money.A founder of Beacon, Wade Eyerly, is now at Wheels Up, which counts the tennis star Serena Williams and the sports broadcaster Erin Andrews among its members. Mr. Eyerly, Wheels Ups managing director, acknowledged that Beacon had miscalculated the demand for flights between New York and Boston.Beacon was a failure to execute, he said. Theres no way to sugarcoat that.But he remains optimistic about consumers desire for private air travel, he said. Wheels Up, he noted, is offering a range of memberships and more destinations, and it operates its own fleet through contractors. He also advised consumers to conduct thorough research before choosing a company.In a technology-driven world, little companies and big companies can look similar, said Mr. Eyerly, who also helped start Surf Air.With so many competitors in the private aviation world, travelers can have difficulty telling the difference between stable and shaky companies. Mr. Schwartz, for example, said he looked into BlackJet before buying a membership, but nothing he found indicated that the company would crumble so suddenly.Red flags should have gone up, but they didnt, he said, adding that he should have looked deeper into the company before paying.Those kinds of failures threaten to erode trust in the industry, said Alex Wilcox, chief executive of JetSuite, a seven-year-old jet charter company based in California with its own fleet.Were all going to be painted with the same brush, he said. But I think people understand the difference between Spirit Airlines and Singapore Airlines. Hopefully, we can distinguish ourselves in the same way.Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Eyerly and others in the industry said potential customers should look as closely as possible at a companys financial backing before paying. Talk to the executives and ask tough questions, they said, which is more easily accomplished at small start-ups.A lot of newer companies just do not have a chance of surviving because the cost of operating jets is so high, said Sergey Petrossov, the founder and chief executive of JetSmarter, which several industry insiders said was a successful example of an aviation start-up, allows members to reserve seats on charters and other private planes using an Uber-like app. Although it allowed nonmembers to book seats until last week, only members may use the service now.This industry as a whole really operates in an unsophisticated way, he said. Anyone who isnt implementing sophisticated math and yield management isnt going to survive."}
{"text": "Consider the mystery of the toy train. This industriously chugging mini-locomotive winds its way through Heros Welcome, Alan Ayckbourns 79th (you read that correctly) play, which just opened at 59E59 Theaters as part of the Brits Off Broadway Festival.In a work that includes all manner of dire deceptions and betrayals, which seem guaranteed to end in tears if not in bloodshed, that little train set  which runs through the entire house of a mayor and her husband  may not seem like such a big deal. But this is a play by Mr. Ayckbourn; nothing is too small to bear revelatory weight.The toy train and its elaborate accouterments, the pride of a middle-aged man and the despair of his tolerant wife, initially register as the kind of quirky, colorful details with which comic playwrights define their characters. But by the end, this seemingly incidental plaything suggests the full dimensions of a relationship, a tragic chapter in its history and, for one character, a fate that may well be worse than death.Little things mean a lot in the world of Mr. Ayckbourn, whose Heros Welcome runs in repertory with his Confusions, a bill of linked sketches written 41 years earlier. (Both productions originated at his home base, the Stephen Joseph Theater of Scarborough, England, and are directed by the author.) The wife and husband described above, played by Elizabeth Boag and Russell Dixon, arent even the central figures in Heros Welcome. That would be the hometown hero of the title and his foreign war bride, embodied by Richard Stacey and Evelyn Hoskins.Yet so deft is Mr. Ayckbourns dramatic shorthand that he can summon complete, quirkily detailed back stories for not one but three intersecting couples in a single, standard-length play. He manages to do so while engineering an elaborate plot, as full of twists and secrets as anything by Ibsen, in which everybody lies, including the British government.Mr. Ayckbourn, 77, has built one of the most prolific and successful careers in British theater on the premise that there are no small parts, in life or onstage. In multiplay masterworks like The Norman Conquests and House and Garden, he keeps shifting points of view, so that characters hitherto in the background suddenly dominate the foreground. And no matter what their positions on the canvas, these people are usually as sad as they are funny and vice versa.The zesty appetizers that make up Confusions (which despite being one of Mr. Ayckbourns most performed works is only now having its New York premiere) demonstrate that this writers sensibility was fully formed years ago, when he was a mere stripling of 35. Theyre trifles by his later standards, quick-sketch farces programmed to end with zingers.But these five one-acters also allow you to see clearly the basic building blocks from which Mr. Ayckbourn constructs his more complex works. And even the silliest of them is steeped in the critical yet compassionate sensibility  call it sentimental cynicism  that is uniquely their creators.The best-known of these is the rowdiest, Gosforths Fete, in which a village fair is leveled by both a thunderstorm and raging human incompetence. My personal favorite is the first on the bill, Mother Figure, in which a homebound housewife has become so used to dealing only with her inexhaustible children that she treats any adults who enter her home as if they were toddlers.Ms. Boag plays the Mom (pricelessly) in that one, and Charlotte Harwood and Stephen Billington are the couple who live next door. All three show up in different roles in the subsequent playlet, set in a small-town hotel, with Mr. Stacey appearing as the absent father from the first play. Mr. Dixon joins their ranks for the third play, and the entire cast of five is recycled for the evenings duration.Thats one of the primary joys of Confusions, watching chameleon performers change identities with wigs and accents, while locations are transformed by the rearrangement of simple pieces of furniture. (Michael Holt is the designer.) But theres also the joy of seeing Mr. Ayckbourn casually play with perspective, as in a restaurant scene in which we hear only what a waiter (Mr. Billington) hears as he moves in and out of earshot between two squabbling tables for two.Heros Welcome has no similar antics of technique. Though it is Mr. Ayckbourns most recent play, it is also one of this most old-fashioned. This tale of a soldiers return to the town he left under shady circumstances years earlier has the structure of a 19th-century melodrama in which the sins of the past overtake the placid present.The plots combustible ingredients include a jilted bride, arson, and a vial of tranquilizers and a loaded gun just begging to be picked up. Yet Heros Welcome remains a comedy, at least in the sense that Chekhov called his plays comedies. Its characters are enjoyably silly in their pretensions and eccentricities. They are also capable of acts of genuine evil and genuine heroism.Heros Welcome is a crowded work, and not just because this production crams three detailed playing spaces  which portray the home turf of the plays three sets of couples  onto a small stage. It has more twists of plot than a season of Coronation Street.But never make the mistake of thinking Mr. Ayckbourn doesnt know what hes doing. The dense, teetering structure of Heros Welcome is dictated by the dense, teetering class structure that still rules and stifles English life.Now throw an outsider into this insular society, and see if she sinks or swims or makes tidal waves. Thats Madrababacascabuna (the delightful Ms. Hoskins), the young wife of the returning hero, who looks like a natural victim.Baba, as her husband calls her, doesnt speak English. Which leads to the expected malapropisms, as when she tells a woman whose house she has just entered, You have a beautiful hole. That hostess, a kind soul in a sour marriage, explains, Youll find that in our language theres lots of words than can be taken in different ways.Having to deal with all that linguistic nuance can be burdensome, of course, and thats more or less true of any culture. Mr. Ayckbourn, gentleman that he is, has given Baba a vaguely Eastern European-sounding language he invented just for her.She approaches a closed world  one in which Mr. Ayckbourns characters are usually prisoners for life  with her own set of shiny new tools. That may sound like a handicap. But in Heros Welcome, its the foreign visitor who has the advantage over the old home team that Mr. Ayckbourn has spent his fruitful career coaching into blunders."}
{"text": "The mass shooting in Orlando on Sunday was appalling in scale: 49 killed in a single attack. But its not unusual for dozens of Americans to be killed by guns in a single day.Gun homicides are a common cause of death in the United States, killing about as many people as car crashes (not counting van, truck, motorcycle or bus accidents). Some cases command our attention more than others, of course. Counting mass shootings that make headlines and the thousands of Americans murdered one or a few at a time, gunshot homicides totaled 8,124 in 2014, according to the F.B.I.This level of violence makes the United States an extreme outlier when measured against the experience of other advanced countries.Around the world, those countries have substantially lower rates of deaths from gun homicide. In Germany, being murdered with a gun is as uncommon as being killed by a falling object in the United States. About two people out of every million are killed in a gun homicide. Gun homicides are just as rare in several other European countries, including the Netherlands and Austria. In the United States, two per million is roughly the death rate for hypothermia or plane crashes.In Poland and England, only about one out of every million people die in gun homicides each year  about as often as an American dies in an agricultural accident or falling from a ladder. In Japan, where gun homicides are even rarer, the likelihood of dying this way is about the same as an Americans chance of being killed by lightning  roughly one in 10 million.In the United States, the death rate from gun homicides is about 31 per million people  the equivalent of 27 people shot dead every day of the year. The homicides include losses from mass shootings, like Sundays Orlando attack, or the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting last December. And of course, they also include the countrys vastly more common single-victim killings.To give you a sense of how unusual Americas gun violence problem is, consider the daily death toll compared with other Western democracies. The chart below imagines that the populations of those countries were the same as the population of the United States.International comparisons help highlight how exceptional the United States is: In a nation where the right to bear arms is cherished by much of the population, gun homicides are a significant public health concern. For men 15 to 29, they are the third-leading cause of death, after accidents and suicides. In other high-income countries, gun homicides are unusual events. Last years Paris attacks killed 130 people, which is nearly as many as die from gun homicides in all of France in a typical year. But even if France had a mass shooting as deadly as the Paris attacks every month, its annual rate of gun homicide death would be lower than that in the United States.The accompanying table shows the mortality rates for gun homicides in a variety of countries, along with a correspondingly likely cause of death in the United States.Our gun homicide numbers come from the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit affiliated with the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, and represent the average gun homicide death rates with data available in those countries between 2007 and 2012. (Data was unavailable for some countries in later years of that period). The United States death rates come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over those same years. There are more recent statistics on American gun deaths, like the F.B.I. number at the top of this article, but we chose these years to provide fair comparisons. We focused on the rates of gun homicides; the overall rate of gun deaths is substantially higher, because suicides make up a majority of gun deaths in the United States and are also higher than in other developed countries.The table is not meant to make light of rare causes of death. Instead, we show them as a way to help think meaningfully about the differences among gun death rates.The rate of gun violence in the United States is not the highest in the world. In parts of Central America, Africa and the Middle East, the gun death rates are even higher  close to those from heart attacks and lung cancer in the United States. In neighboring Mexico, where a drug war rages, 122 people per million die in a gun homicide, a rate slightly higher than Americans death rate from pancreatic cancer. But the countries with those levels of gun violence are not like the United States in many other ways, including G.D.P., life expectancy and education. Among developed democracies, the United States is an outlier.Editors note: A version of this article was first published in December 2015 and was updated after the Orlando shootings."}
{"text": "THE UNSPOKEN REASON BEHIND THE LINKEDIN SALE  |  Microsofts $26.2 billion cash deal to buy LinkedIn was by far the largest in its history, and its biggest bet on a shift from traditional software toward cloud computing, Nick Wingfield reports in DealBook.The chief of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, has already improved his companys image by opening up to partnerships with once-bitter rivals like Salesforce, and he has accelerated the companys shift to cloud services.  LinkedIn also caters to professionals, opening up the possibility of linking its network with Microsoft tools, and Microsoft is paying less than it would have done last fall when shares were trading at more than $260 a share. They closed at $131.08 on Friday.Still, the value of the deal harks back to the heady heights of yesteryears technology valuations, Michael J. de la Merced and Leslie Picker report in DealBook. It gives LinkedIn an enterprise value at 79 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the 12 months that ended on March 31. By that measure, the transaction is more expensive than any big internet deal paid with cash, according to Bloomberg data.Microsoft is paying $220 for each of LinkedIns monthly users, compared with the $40 Facebook paid for each WhatsApp user two years ago. Microsoft just paid on the assumption that were going back to the multiples we had a year ago, but I dont think thats happening, said Max Wolff, the chief economist at Manhattan Venture partners.LinkedIn  will operate as an independent brand, in the same way as WhatsApp did after being acquired by Facebook. Jeff Weiner will continue as chief executive.The attractions of the deal for LinkedIn are clear, in light of the struggling stock price. But the company is also heavily reliant on stock-based compensation, an issue that Mr. Weiner did not mention on Monday,  Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.LinkedIn employees are paid largely in stock, and its shares plummeted more than 40 percent in February after a weaker-than-expected growth forecast. There have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes, Mr. Sorkin writes.However the company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation from its earnings, turning losses into gains. Stock-based compensation represented 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mark Mahaney, a longtime technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue. LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which have the most dependence on stock-based compensation, also had results of lower quality, Mr. Mahaney said.LinkedIn has justified the practice by saying that stock-based compensation is noncash in nature and that excluding it provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. But investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical. And Facebook, which used to do the same, changed its policy in April, saying that stock-based compensation played an important role in how it paid its employees and was therefore a real expense for the business.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn would soon have had to use a more realistic version of its earnings and report more losses. Microsoft said that the combined company would follow Microsofts practice of including stock-based compensation in earnings calculations.As it was, LinkedIns decision to sell suggested that the stand-alone outlook was not especially alluring, Robert Cyran writes in Breakingviews. And there are questions on Microsofts side, too, Mr. Cyran writes. It had to write down the $9.5 billion it paid for Nokia and the $6.3 billion it paid for the aQuantive digital advertising agency.These were deals sealed by Mr. Nadellas predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, but it is hard to make these transactions pay off. Concrete indications of the deals financial benefits are in worryingly short supply, Mr. Cyran notes.There will be a windfall for the companies advisers, though, Mr. de la Merced writes in DealBook.Microsoft drew on two traditional advisers, Morgan Stanley, one of the top investment banks in Silicon Valley, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, a law firm that has long advised Microsoft on its transactions. LinkedIn was advised by the boutique firms Qatalyst and Allen & Company. LinkedIn has long been a client of Allen & Company, while Qatalyst, founded by the longtime deal maker Frank Quattrone, has long been a go-to for tech companies looking to sell themselves. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which previously advised on the takeover of the online learning company Lynda, provided legal counsel to LinkedIn.SUPREME COURT REJECTS PUERTO RICO LAW IN DEBT RESTRUCTURING CASE   |  The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an effort  to allow Puerto Ricos public utilities to restructure $20 billion in debt, striking down a 2014 Puerto Rico law, \nAdam Liptak and Mary Williams Walsh report in DealBook.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in the 5-to-2 decision, said the law was at odds with the federal bankruptcy code, which bars states and lower units of government from enacting their own versions of bankruptcy law. \nChapter 9, the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent local governments, excludes Puerto Rico, so the island tried to enact its own version of a bankruptcy law in 2014.  Officials argued that the so-called Recovery Act addressed a gap in the way Puerto Ricos debts were treated,  but creditors challenged the act in federal court and the justices agreed.  \nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the majoritys approach was too mechanical and failed to account for the purpose of the bankruptcy law and the impact of its decision.  Justice Sotomayor wrote that the majoritys approach ignored the crisis facing the utilities, which could imperil their ability to provide safe drinking water and maintain modes of transport. \nThe case has been vexing for all parties because when Congress amended the bankruptcy code to exclude Puerto Rico, in 1984, it left no written record explaining why. And it has barred the island from the only path to legally reducing debt over the objections of creditors.\n\n\n\n\nON THE AGENDA   |  Data on retail sales in May will be published at 8:30 a.m. Mary Jo White, who leads the Securities and Exchange Commission, will testify before the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs at 9 a.m. The Senate Committee on Finance will hold a hearing on energy tax policy at 10 a.m. James P.

It claimed that it was an unsophisticated investor with staff that had little experience with investment banking and Goldman had preyed on this, persuading the fund to invest in complex transactions that it did not understand or desire. \nRoger Masefield, a lawyer for the fund, argued that Goldman lured the fund into investments with training programs, gifts, overseas trips and internships for the brother of a staff member. \nGoldman disputed the claims and said the Libyan Investment Authority had the financial sophistication to understand the disputed transactions. \nThe fund focused on the actions of Youssef Kabbaj, a former Goldman Sachs banker. The fund said that Mr. Kabbaj wined and dined fund employees on training trips to London, which included stays in stylish hotels and expensive meals at famous restaurants. He also bought presents and took staff members on vacation to Morocco, according to the court filings. \nMr. Masefield argued that Mr. Kabbaj worked on both sides of the derivatives transactions, ghost writing documents for staff members of the fund to be used to persuade its board to invest and then separately making presentations to the fund on behalf of Goldman Sachs.SUPREME COURT REJECTS PUERTO RICO LAW IN DEBT RESTRUCTURING CASE   |  The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an effort  to allow Puerto Ricos public utilities to restructure $20 billion in debt, striking down a 2014 Puerto Rico law,Adam Liptak and Mary Williams Walsh report in DealBook.Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in the 5-to-2 decision, said the law was at odds with the federal bankruptcy code, which bars states and lower units of government from enacting their own versions of bankruptcy law.Chapter 9, the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent local governments, excludes Puerto Rico, so the island tried to enact its own version of a bankruptcy law in 2014.

{"text": "This summer on Long Islands East End, one exhibition features artwork thats a far cry from the stereotypical blue-chip Hamptons summer style, with utopian aspirations and often provisional aesthetics. Radical Seafaring, organized by the Parrish Art Museum curator Andrea Grover, brings together 25 artists and collectives who create, as she writes, land art, only afloat: installations and performances designed to be experienced off dry land. The show traces the history of the genre, from midcentury Conceptualists such as Bas Jan Ader (who was tragically lost at sea during a 1975 sailing performance), Chris Burden and the obscure Japanese collective The Play to contemporary makers like Mark Dion, Duke Riley and Swoon. And for two weeks this summer, the New York-based artist Mary Mattingly brings the exhibition truly offshore with WetLand, a houseboat sculpture docked beside yachts at the Long Wharf in Sag Harbor.Mattingly, 37, follows the tradition of environmental artists who devise alternative ways of living in the face of impending ecological disaster: she seeks to explore what you can do on the water that you cant do on land, she says, and considers the sea an extension of the commons. In a 2009 work, the Waterpod project, Mattingly and four others lived on a self-sustaining barge that navigated New Yorks waterways, kitted out with solar energy, edible plants, a water filtration system and chicken coop. Mattingly initially conceived WetLand  a repurposed 1971 Rockwell Whitcraft houseboat  for the Philadelphia nonprofit FringeArts in 2014. Collaborating with over 30 organizations, Mattingly gutted the 45-by-12-foot vessel, outfitting it with solar panels and varied species of wood stripped from a gym floor in Iowa. She describes the dramatically sloping boat as something between sinking and rising, a shack and a palace. It symbolically evokes the housing market crash, and is literally reminiscent of collapsing homes.At the Parrish, as in Philadelphia, WetLand functions as a semi-sustainable residency and a platform for Mattingly to demonstrate DIY solutions. The boat contains a rainwater purification system, a composting toilet, a bathtub, a library and edible perennial plants. The project, and Mattingly herself, attract a loyal following  last Wednesday, a duck even spontaneously laid eggs on the vessel. And the utopian thinking that informs WetLand carries through to Mattinglys next venture, Swale, which launches at the end of this month: a floating food forest, host to perennial crops like figs and huckleberries, on a 130-by-110-foot barge that will sail around the city."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an effort in Puerto Rico to allow public utilities there to restructure $20 billion in debt, striking down a 2014 Puerto Rico law.Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in the 5-to-2 decision, said the law was at odds with the federal bankruptcy code, which bars states and lower units of government from enacting their own versions of bankruptcy law.Puerto Rico is struggling with $72 billion  in debt and has argued that it needs to restructure at least some of it under Chapter 9, the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent local governments. But Puerto Rico is not permitted to do so, because Chapter 9 specifically excludes it, although it is unclear why.In 2014, the island tried to get around that exclusion by enacting its own version of a bankruptcy law, intended for its big public utilities, which account for about $26 billion of the total debt. But that attempt, called the Recovery Act, ran afoul of the part of the code that says only Congress may enact bankruptcy laws.Puerto Rican officials had argued that the Recovery Act addressed a gap in the way its debts are treated. Under the bankruptcy code, they said, states may authorize their cities, counties, public utilities and other branches of government to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the code. But that law excludes Puerto Rico and all branches of its government, including its public utilities.Utility creditors challenged the Recovery Act in federal court, arguing that the bankruptcy code displaced, or pre-empted, it. The justices agreed.The federal law, Justice Thomas wrote, bars Puerto Rico from enacting its own municipal bankruptcy scheme to restructure the debt of its insolvent public utilities. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan joined him.Justice Thomas wrote that the decision was compelled by a straightforward reading of the federal law.In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the majoritys approach was too mechanical and failed to take into account the purpose of the bankruptcy law and the impact of its decision. The Recovery Act, she wrote, is the only existing legal option for Puerto Rico to restructure debts that could cripple its citizens.The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its municipalities are in the middle of a fiscal crisis, she wrote. The combined debt of Puerto Ricos three main public utilities exceeds $20 billion. These utilities provide power, water, sewer and transportation to residents of the island.With rising interest rates and limited access to capital markets, their debts are proving unserviceable. Soon, Puerto Rico and the utilities contend, they will be unable to pay for things like fuel to generate electricity, which will lead to rolling blackouts, Justice Sotomayor added. Other vital public services will be imperiled, including the utilities ability to provide safe drinking water, maintain roads and operate public transportation.The majoritys approach ignores those realities, she wrote, rejects contextual analysis in favor of a syllogism and leaves Puerto Rico powerless and with no legal process to help its citizens.Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Ricos nonvoting member of Congress, said: The practical significance of the courts holding is crystal clear. Only Congress can provide the Puerto Rico government with the authority to restructure its debts. He said action by Congress is essential if the territory is going to overcome its severe  and worsening  economic, fiscal and demographic crisis.The case has been vexing for all parties because when Congress amended the bankruptcy code to exclude Puerto Rico, in 1984, it left no written record explaining why. Yet the rule barred the island from the only way under United States law that a debtor can legally reduce debt over the objections of creditors.Besides passing its own bankruptcy law in 2014, Puerto Rico tried to persuade Congress to delete the 1984 exclusion. It said the provision was inexplicable and may have been inserted by mistake.Those arguments did not sway Congress. But last year lawmakers realized the United States Constitution gave them the power to make all needful rules and regulations for territories, including Puerto Rico. Using that approach, the House of Representatives passed a quasi-bankruptcy bill this month that would apply to all territories (though only Puerto Rico is in dire need at the moment).Obama administration officials have expressed hope that the Senate will take up the measure quickly and enact it before July 1, when Puerto Rico is supposed to make debt payments totaling nearly $2 billion. It is expected to default, which would normally prompt creditors to sue. As now drafted, the bill would stay such lawsuits, put Puerto Rico under federal oversight and give it other legal powers similar to those found in bankruptcy.In the majority opinion, Justice Thomas noted that Puerto Rico had also been seeking help from Congress. After the parties briefed and argued these cases, he wrote, members of Congress introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to establish an oversight board to assist Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, adding that the bill does not amend the federal bankruptcy code.Justice Sotomayor responded that the government and people of Puerto Rico should not have to wait for possible congressional action to avert the consequences of unreliable electricity, transportation and safe water  consequences that members of the executive and legislature have described as a looming humanitarian crisis..Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused himself from the cases, Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust, No. 15-233, and Acosta-Febo v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust, No. 15-255. As is the courts custom, he did not explain why."}
{"text": "MEXICO CITY  Back in the late 1980s, the air got so dirty in Mexico City that birds would emit a final chirp before they tumbled from the trees onto the sidewalk, their small, still bodies a sad testament to some of the worlds worst air pollution.I heard this story a lot when I first arrived in the city a few years later. Nobody had actually seen it happen, of course, but the urban legends black humor revealed a perverse pride in survival.Then the smog began to lift. The government shut down a big oil refinery and pushed heavy industry out of the city. Regulations stripped the lead from gasoline and created incentives for people to buy cleaner new cars.And the birdsong resumed.Until now. The city has registered only 20 clean days so far this year. On all the other days, particulates and ozone rose above the governments limit.What accounts for the backsliding? A central reason is that pollution simply dropped off the publics radar.As long as people dont complain and its not high visibility, the government doesnt put a high priority on it, said Mario J. Molina, a Nobel laureate in chemistry and the director of a Mexico City research institute that bears his name, who is advising the authorities about the next steps they should take.Without a sense of urgency, antipollution measures that could have made a difference years ago have stalled. The federal government, for example, has dawdled over raising the emissions standards for new vehicles.Although the region was able to reduce levels of major pollutants well into the 2000s, ozone and particulates remained stubbornly high over the past decade and even increased.In April, the regional environment commission forced the issue by sharply lowering the level at which it declares an emergency.Suddenly, talk of pollution is everywhere. Radio reports give hourly updates as ozone levels climb each afternoon, noting how close the city is to another emergency. Newspapers plaster their front pages with photographs of vast urban landscapes shrouded in a gray-yellow murk. On Twitter, drivers post photographs of vehicles coughing filthy fumes. A longtime laissez-faire approach to outdoor activities has given way to anxious checks of the citys pollution map.There were rumors that the government was importing dirty gasoline from China, which officials quickly denied.The smoggy reality has led the authorities to clamp down. Emergency measures are in force until the end of the month, when the summer rains come.Every day, roughly 20 percent of the regions cars are grounded. Ozone and particulates have climbed so high that the environment commission has declared eight pollution emergencies since March, imposing special rules that include taking 40 percent of the cars off the road.But drivers waiting at an emissions inspections station recently said that they were taking all the heat.Keeping cars at home does not resolve absolutely anything, said scar Rojas Ayala, 50, a criminal defense lawyer who uses his 2009 Mitsubishi sport utility vehicle to visit his clients in the citys far-flung jails. They should prove it.This is all just a business for the government to make more money, said Armando Corts de la Rosa, 58, who does not live in the city but needs an inspection sticker to visit relatives. You take two million cars off the road and the pollution has continued.Whats the strategy? asked Elsa Pliego, 46. Some antipollution measures just create more traffic, she argued, like the bike lanes that herd cars into single file. Today they do one thing. Tomorrow another.To understand why having a car here is so important, consider the daily commute of Iris Venegas Maldonado. She leaves no later than 6:15 a.m. from her parents house in the northern suburb of Tlalnepantla, catching two lurching microbuses before she reaches a subway station.She takes exaggeratedly crowded subway trains before emerging back onto the street, where she boards yet another bus to arrive at her job as a physician assistant at 9 a.m.Its frustrating, because I spend so much time during my day traveling, said Ms. Venegas, 26, who just completed medical school.On a recent day, a protest march had diverted traffic, and she spent seven hours on public transportation. I could have been doing something else, she said, in something of an understatement.At the heart of the problem is how this megalopolis of more than 20 million people has evolved.About 8.5 million people live in Mexico City, and the rest inhabit an endless sprawl that encompasses everything from gated communities to concrete slums. But residents of both rich and poor neighborhoods are often far from their jobs. As soon as any family can afford to buy a car, it does.The Mario Molina Center estimates that there are now more than five million cars in the metropolitan area.Mexico Citys mayor, Miguel ngel Mancera, said old regulations have inhibited the construction of low-income housing inside the citys limits. The people who want to live here cannot, he said in an interview. The city has to become more compact so that people do not make these crazy trips.Leonardo Martnez Flores, an urban planning expert who coordinated the areas 2011-20 regional air plan, said the problem was about much more than housing: The entire city must be reconceived.If you dont attack the problem of the urban structure, it doesnt matter how much you invest in public transport, warned Mr. Martnez, who is also advising the city on emergency pollution measures. It doesnt resolve the underlying issue.The path of least resistance means the city has accommodated itself to cars. A long ribbon of elevated highway circles much of the city before expanding north into the neighboring State of Mexico, where public transportation is at its most haphazard. In my years here, I have seen developments the size of a small American city spring up with only a four-lane access road  plus speed bumps  built to reach them.Developers erect skyscrapers with a dozen floors reserved for parking. The Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, an economic think tank, estimates that 42 percent of space in new developments built between 2009 and 2013 was designated for parking.We are constructing housing for cars, said Gabriela Alarcn, an urban planning expert at the institute.Some people blame new speed limits for the pollution. Given that the average driving speed at rush hour is between three and seven miles per hour, the Mario Molina Center dryly noted that the new regulations did not require priority attention.Last week, the federal and local governments announced new emissions inspection rules, which, for the first time, apply to trucks and buses. Cars will no longer be automatically grounded, but emissions levels will be stricter and inspections tightened to prevent widespread corruption.The city has pledged to install new sensors to detect dirty vehicles, which the police would then stop and tow.Mayor Mancera promised that the new rules on dirty trucks and buses, among other measures, would constitute a before and after for the city.He has also proposed a crackdown on industrial emissions and programs for cleaner taxis and delivery vans, and has begun negotiations to limit cargo trucks to nighttime hours.Back at the emissions inspection center, drivers debated what  or who  was to blame.Gerardo Snchez, 40, who sells salads to office workers from the back of his 2007 Volkswagen Pointer and loses income when his car is grounded, named a favorite culprit.The politicians have two or three cars of bodyguards behind them, he said. How much do they pollute?"}
{"text": "AUSTIN, Tex.  Norman Lear, his signature white canvas hat firmly in place, sat in an emptying theater here on Friday, marveling at the embarrassment of artistic riches his once maligned medium has become.It awes me how much great television there is, and great performances, the veteran writer and producer said. The women in Orange Is the New Black, theres more talent there than used to grace three networks, back when there were just three networks.Mr. Lear, 93, who practically invented the notion that television could amount to more than mere diversion with his boundary-pushing sitcoms like All in the Family and Maude, was here for the ATX Television Festival. The emerging confab, now in its fifth year, is intended to celebrate, market and critically examine an exponentially expanding medium whose extraordinary creative fertility is now taken for granted.The festival, which concluded on Sunday, has grown considerably, drawing 2,500 attendees, up from roughly 700 in its first year, as well as ever more rarefied TV luminaries like Mr. Lear and Aaron Sorkin, who presided over a raucous 10-year reunion of his landmark political drama, The West Wing.The goal, say the ATX founders Caitlin McFarland and Emily Gipson, is to connect fans and TV professionals to both celebrate beloved series and their showrunners  the rock stars of this festival, Ms. McFarland said  and discuss issues facing the industry. To us it seemed that more than any other medium, television was a community [whose members] needed to talk to one another, she added.The festivals rapid growth is the latest sign of televisions pop cultural ubiquity, both in the broader conversation and in sheer volume. More than 400 scripted series ran in 2015  with hundreds more reality shows and docu-series  and some of the most popular, like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, are among the most discussed topics of any sort online.In its focus on series past and present and the increasingly activist nature of TV fandom, ATX is both an outgrowth of and a real-world analog to the contemporary viewing experience, when new series sit alongside still-popular old ones in streaming queues. At the packed West Wing reunion filling the 1,200-seat Paramount Theater here, Mr. Sorkin marveled at the large numbers of younger fans who would have been in kindergarten when the show ran on NBC.The thing about television is, you never get to see the audience, he said. Its great to finally meet you.While established festivals like South by Southwest, Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival have added television programming in recent years, events devoted to the medium are relatively rare. The Paley Center has its long-running PaleyFest and New York magazines newer Vulture Festival is heavily focused on TV. Others, like the New York Television Festival, are dedicated to promoting smaller, independent works or, like the Festival de Tlvision de Monte-Carlo, marketing international ones.In ATX, Ms. McFarland and Ms. Gipson sought to split the difference between industry events like the annual Upfronts, in which networks present new shows to advertisers, and sprawling fan extravaganzas like Comic-Con, but with the mingling and general summer-camp feel of many film conferences. But unlike film festivals, intended largely to build buzz and secure distribution deals for new offerings, the idea was to blend nostalgia for old series with excitement about current and future ones.Ms. McFarland, a former assistant to directors like Betty Thomas and Nora Ephron, was working in retail when she mentioned the idea to Ms. Gipson in 2011, roughly a year before the first ATX festival. (Ms. Gipson was an assistant at Discovery Communications at the time.) Soon they reached out to industry people, whose enthusiasm led to discussions with potential sponsors and a Kickstarter campaign that exceeded their $25,000 goal. Still, it wasnt until the final day of the first festival, when various attendees announced their intentions to return the following year, when it was like O.K., this is going to work, Ms. McFarland said. And oh, were doing this again.ATXs mix of fan service with more substantive discussions offers a glimpse at the deep ties viewers form with beloved shows, across the emotional spectrum. At an old football field outside Austin, where Friday Night Lights was shot, former Dillon Panthers braved the heat and posed for dozens of pictures. We have new fans finding us every year and the old fans continue to talk about it, said Scott Porter, who played the paralyzed former quarterback Jason Street.A panel on the representation of gay characters, on the other hand, sprang from fan outrage, specifically over televisions tendency to kill them off at a disproportionate rate. The deaths of such characters in the past year on shows like Empire, The Walking Dead and the CW science fiction series The 100, especially, enraged and galvanized many viewers, leading to renewed calls on Twitter and elsewhere to end the  trope. The issue took on terrible new relevance when, hours after the panel, a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. (The festival canceled a panel on violence on television after the shooting.)The discussion brought up the challenges of making provocative shows that viewers want while also respecting historically marginalized fans. Every L.G.B.T. person has that character that you first saw who you were like, Oh, this is me, and this is my story, said Megan Townsend, a representative of Glaad, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group.Mr. Lear was on hand to accept an award and discuss Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You, a new documentary based on his 2014 autobiography. Currently producing a Cuban-American version of his family sitcom One Day at a Time for Netflix, he finds himself a patron saint of modern TV trends, as well as a participant.But even though Im a professional in the field, Im an audience member first, he said. My experience is the same at 93 that it was when I was a kid."}
{"text": "SHANGHAI  Disney had pushed China too hard, putting the companys plans for a new theme park here in limbo. Now, Robert A. Iger wanted to kick the yearslong negotiations into high gear.Mr. Iger, Disneys chief executive, took a corporate jet to Shanghai in February 2008 to meet with the citys new Communist Party boss, Yu Zhengsheng. Over dinner at a state guesthouse, Mr. Iger offered a more conciliatory approach, setting the tone for the next phase of talks.After that, Disney substantially dialed back its demands. In addition to handing over a large piece of the profit, the control-obsessed company would give the government a role in running the park. Disney was also prepared to drop its longstanding insistence on a television channel.For Disney, such moves were once unthinkable. Giving up on the Disney Channel meant abandoning the companys proven brand-building strategy. Were kidding ourselves if we think were going to get everything we want, Mr. Iger recalled saying at the time.Mr. Igers trip and the new attitude in the talks that followed appeased Chinese officials. Before long, they had struck a landmark deal to build the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort, opening China to a singularly American brand and setting the pace for multinational companies to do business in the country.The Shanghai park, which opens on Thursday, has become mission critical for Disney as it faces business pressures in other areas like cable. It is designed to be a machine in China for the Disney brand, with a manicured Magic Kingdom-style park, Toy Story-themed hotel and Mickey Avenue shopping arcade. More than 330 million people live within a three-hour drive or train ride, and Disney is bent on turning them into lifelong consumers.But Disney is sharing the keys to the Magic Kingdom with the Communist Party. While that partnership has made it easier to get things done in China, it has also given the government influence over everything from the price of admission to the types of rides at the park.From the outset, Disney has catered to Chinese officials, who had to approve the parks roster of rides and who were especially keen to have a large-scale park that would appeal to adults as well as children. The Shanghai resort, which will ultimately be four times as big as Disneyland, has a supersize castle, a longer parade than any of the other five Disney resorts around the world, and a vast central garden aimed at older visitors.Worried that importing classic rides would reek of cultural imperialism, Disney left out stalwarts such as Space Mountain, the Jungle Cruise and Its a Small World. Instead, 80 percent of the Shanghai rides, like the Tron lightcycle roller coaster, are unique, a move that pleased executives at the companys Chinese partner, the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, who made multiple trips to Disney headquarters in California to hash out blueprint details.Disney then ran with the idea, infusing the park with Chinese elements. The Shanghai resorts signature restaurant, the Wandering Moon Teahouse, has rooms designed to represent different areas of the country. The restaurant is billed as honoring the restless, creative spirit of Chinese poets.Such accommodation is becoming increasingly common. A growing number of multinationals have agreed to cooperate with the Chinese state through alliances, joint ventures or partnerships, all in the hopes of garnering more favorable treatment and gaining access to the worlds second-largest economy, after the United States.And they are doing so at a time when the Chinese government is growing more assertive and  nationalistic. Emboldened by the size and breadth of its economy, China is stepping up its demands, pressuring companies to lower their prices, hand over proprietary technology and help advance the countrys development goals, even if that means financing the growth of local rivals.IBM has promised to share technology with China. LinkedIn has agreed to censor content inside the country. Even Google has been scrounging for a way back into China, after withdrawing in 2010 in the face of accusations of government censorship and intrusions by state-backed hackers.This is part of the China trade-off, said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. If your market is so big, well accept rules and regulations we wouldnt in other parts of the world.For Disney, if all goes as planned, the Shanghai park will create an ecosystem of demand in China for movies, toys, clothes, video games, books and TV programs. Mr. Iger has called Shanghai the greatest opportunity the company has had since Walt Disney himself bought land in Central Florida in the 1960s.That site, of course, became Walt Disney World, a group of four theme parks that attracts roughly 40 million visitors annually. About 11 million visitors are expected next year at the Shanghai park, with annual attendance estimated to reach 20 million within a few years, according to Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.If all doesnt go as planned, Disney will suffer the wrath of Wall Street, which expects the resort to offset slower growth at ESPN, the companys longtime profit engine, and some of its other theme parks. The last thing Disney wants is another Disneyland Paris, a money pit that suffered from cultural miscues and, after 24 years, is still struggling to turn a profit. Hong Kong Disneyland, which is relatively small, has had mixed financial results since opening in 2005.Mr. Iger has staked his personal legacy on Disneys partnership with the Chinese government. Last September, he brought a group of Disney board members to Shanghai to show off the park. They took in the worlds largest Disney castle, looking on as 11,000 construction workers raced to finish a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed underwater voyage. His signature is quite literally on the place: He autographed the castles golden spire before it was attached last year.While he delegated certain duties to lieutenants, Mr. Iger has been the guiding force. He pre-tasted the food, which will include items like pork knuckles and Donald Duck-shaped waffles, and decided which characters would appear in the parade. He has held face-to-face talks with Chinese presidents, prime ministers and propaganda officials.Mr. Iger, 65, has sought a personal relationship with Chinas paramount leader, President Xi Jinping. After Mr. Iger learned that Mr. Xis father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary leader, had visited Disneyland in 1980, he pressed his staff to find a photograph. A color photograph shows the presidents father, who died in 2002, wearing a Mao suit, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Mr. Iger presented it to the Chinese leader as a gift and a symbol of their partnership.When Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle last September, Mr. Iger was among the American executives on hand to welcome him. At the White House state dinner a few days later, Mr. Iger was seated at Mr. Xis table. Just last month, Mr. Iger flew to Beijing to meet the president at the Communist Partys leadership compound.Its good to see the fruits of efforts over the years, a smiling Mr. Xi told Mr. Iger at a public meeting between the men at the Great Hall of the People in early May. And I believe the new cooperation will continue to yield new outcomes.It may be all smiles now, but Mickey Mouse knows all too well what can happen when the Middle Kingdom gets mad.The year was 1997, and Disney had finally found a bit of success in China. The Dragon Club, a Disney cartoon series, was popular in Chinese homes, and The Lion King had given Disney its first big hit in Chinese cinemas. But then came Kundun.As part of a now-defunct effort to make films for more sophisticated audiences, Disney agreed to back the director Martin Scorsese, who wanted to make Kundun, about Chinas oppression of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader. The Chinese government, which considers the Dalai Lama a separatist, denounced the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.In the end, Disney decided that it could not let an overseas government influence its decision to distribute a movie in the United States. Kundun was released, and China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling The Dragon Club.All of our business in China stopped overnight, Disneys chief executive at the time, Michael D. Eisner, recalled.Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was screened in Shanghai in the 1930s, Disney really had no measurable business in China until decades later, when Mr. Eisner secured Sunday evening placement for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons on the countrys biggest state-run broadcaster. That led to Mickeys Corner kiosks that sold consumer goods like Minnie Mouse-branded shampoo, and to more television shows.By the time of the Kundun debacle, the demand was clearly there. Mr. Eisner just needed to undo the damage.Disney hired former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and mounted an intense lobbying effort. In October 1998, Mr. Eisner met Zhu Rongji, who had just been named prime minister, at Chinas leadership compound in Beijing. Mr. Eisner apologized for Kundun, calling it a stupid mistake, according to a transcript of the meeting.This film was a form of insult to our friends, but other than journalists, very few people in the world ever saw it, Mr. Eisner said during the meeting. (Kundun bombed, taking in just $5.7 million against a production budget of about $30 million.)Mr. Eisner said the company had learned a lesson. And he introduced Mr. Iger, then Disneys international president, as the person who would carry on negotiations for a theme park. The Chinese prime minister responded favorably. Land in Shanghai, he said, had already been set aside.And just like that, the door to China started to reopen.The negotiations that followed were slow and painful. Disney had to navigate a thicket of agencies, bureaucrats and officials. At one point, Disney essentially had to start over in Shanghai, after a senior Chinese official was abruptly arrested on corruption charges unrelated to the park.There were sticking points large and small. Who would control the park? What kind of transportation infrastructure would support it? How were Disneys nightly fireworks shows going to work in smoggy Shanghai? There was also the not-so-minor matter of introducing Disney characters to a country whose icon, since the Communists took power in 1949, was Mao.Disney had to educate the Chinese government on how they operate, and the government wanted to persuade Disney that they needed a local partner to make this thing work, said Tang Jun, one of Mr. Igers former lieutenants in China.By 2009, the Chinese government was finally on board. It took a 57 percent stake in the Shanghai resort, which includes revenue from hotels, restaurants and merchandise sold on the grounds. Disney also gave the government a 30 percent piece of the Disney management company that runs the property.It was in stark contrast to the deal with Hong Kong. Desperate to end a tourism slump, Hong Kong had given Disney breathtaking terms, including providing a majority of the construction funds. Disney gave up no management control.At the groundbreaking ceremony for the Shanghai resort in April 2011, Mr. Iger and Thomas O. Staggs, then Disneys theme park chief, posed for a clichd photo: Holding shovels, the Disney executives stood alongside two of Shanghais most powerful leaders, Han Zheng and Mr. Yu, and ceremoniously scooped up loose dirt from an indoor stage.Confetti was blasted into the air. A 50-member childrens choir sang as Chinese dancers and drummers paraded onstage. Mickey and Minnie Mouse frolicked in traditional Chinese costumes.This is a defining moment in our companys history, Mr. Iger said. Along with our partner, the Shanghai Shendi Group, today I am very proud to announce the official launch of the Shanghai Disney Resort.When the Communist Party first invited overseas companies into the country in 1979, global businesses had to team up with the state. It wasnt pretty.As commercial interests clashed with socialist principles, there were wage disputes, allegations of intellectual property theft and conflicts over corporate strategy. To put it in the parlance of a Chinese proverb, it was like two people sleeping in the same bed, dreaming different dreams.Pepsi found itself managing a tanning factory, as part of its Chinese partnership. McDonnell Douglas claimed that some machine tools had been diverted to a factory that made missiles, in violation of United States rules. The American and Chinese partners in Beijing Jeep disagreed over quality control.I now tell people, If you dont have to do a joint venture, dont, said Don St. Pierre Sr., an American businessman who worked for Beijing Jeep.After the blowups, China started to allow some companies to go it alone. But Disney didnt have a choice. The Communist Party maintains strict control over media companies.The partnership has significant perks for Disney. State-run construction companies cleared a 1,700-acre tract to build the resort, which will ultimately include two additional Disney theme parks and thousands of Disney hotel rooms, analysts say. Authorities have relocated residents, moved graves and closed more than 150 polluting factories. The government built new infrastructure, including a subway line that goes directly to the parks front gate.Officials have also taken unusual steps to protect Disney from piracy in China, a country where copyright infringement is common and the government rarely intervenes. Whether the state can stand by that pledge is uncertain. But early signs are promising. Last November, regulators fined five copycat Disney hotels located near the theme park. Around the same time, nearly 2,000 counterfeit Disney items, including hundreds of Winnie-the-Pooh shirts, were seized in Hangzhou. The government is even sending regulators to Disney for special training to help them better identify counterfeits.The partnership is structured so that it will work, said Mr. Iger. They have a tremendous amount riding on it.But Disney is stepping into a potential minefield. State leaders are growing more confident about exerting influence over multinationals. The government is pushing to upgrade Chinas economy, and it wants state-owned companies to learn from partners like Disney while amassing a large share of the profits.Along with its stake in the park, Shendi stands to make a fortune from a 4,000-acre plot of land that it controls around the resort. In other locales, Disney has typically maintained a firm grip on the immediately adjacent real estate. Shendi wants to use such land for hotels, spas and retail, like its new Shanghai Village, a 590,000-square-foot outlet mall, with luxury shops selling Armani, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture and other brands.The Shanghai government sees Disney as just one piece of a broader effort to redevelop Pudong, the citys easternmost region, by creating industrial parks and tourist destinations. Just 30 miles southeast of Disneys site, the government has promoted Winterland, which bills itself as the worlds largest indoor ski resort and entertainment facility. Nearby, Haichang Polar Ocean World promises performances by beluga whales, dolphins, polar bears and arctic wolves.China wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragons head, a showcase city for all the world to see, said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American businessman who has worked with the Shanghai government. Disney is part of that grand strategy.The partnership structure puts Disney in a complicated spot. Shendi is really a consortium of four powerful government-owned companies: the Shanghai Radio, Film and Television Development Company; Jin Jiang Hotels; Bailian retail shops; and a property developer, the Lujiazui Group. And each of those companies has separate business ties to Disneys new resort.The Jin Jiang Group has a contract to provide tourism services for the park. The Lujiazui Group helped develop the worlds largest Disney Store. The Shanghai Media Group, a division of the development company, is positioned to capture a big share of the parks television and advertising budget, since it controls the citys biggest television stations, as well as major newspapers, magazines and radio properties.So Disney will have to deal with a bewildering array of state affiliates acting as partners, suppliers and even competitors, making contract negotiations complex and raising thorny conflict-of-interest issues. Shendi, for instance, has set up its own energy company to supply natural gas to the theme park site. And Shanghai Media Group has formed alliances or made investments with Disney competitors like Sony, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks Animation.The more partners you have, the more potential conflicts, said Oded Shenkar, a professor of business at Ohio State University and an authority on Chinese joint ventures.Each of those state companies may come with multiple other affiliations, he added. A multinational must then contend with a whole network of relationships and interdependencies they often cannot decipher.When Disney unveiled the website for the Shanghai park in March, the fervor was instantaneous. The site registered five million hits in less than half an hour. Tickets for the first two weeks sold out within hours. Over one weekend in early May, with the opening still a month away, more than 100,000 people visited the resort to peek through the park gates and explore a shopping area that doesnt require a ticket.But criticism has begun, too. Disney has been pilloried in local media for its prices ($1 for a single steamed bun, or about five times the street price). Some initial visitors trampled the public gardens. And Disney has had to deploy uniformed security guards to maintain order at popular rides, where lines during the soft opening stretched up to three hours. Shanghai authorities recently published an etiquette guide.The frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed, Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which operates a chain of Chinese theme parks, said on state television in May.Mr. Iger brushed off Mr. Wangs criticism as patently absurd, and said media reports about food pricing complaints were overblown. We made a decision with our quick-service restaurants to go higher-end, and theres a cost to that, he said.Disney needs to avoid getting lost in translation, an especially difficult proposition in China. It is a deeply American brand trying to break into a country where the government wants to suppress Western ideals.Already, Shanghai Disneyland is triggering concerns about American cultural imperialism. At a gathering of Chinas political leaders in Beijing in March, an official called for limiting Disneys expansion and growth.I suggest that we shouldnt allow too many Disneyland theme parks to be built in China, said Li Xiusong, the deputy head of culture in the eastern Anhui Province. If children follow Western culture when they are little, they will end up liking Western culture when they grow up and be uninterested in Chinese culture.The countrys leaders have also grown more nationalistic in recent years: Everything must serve the states interest. The Communist Party is using Disney to bolster the countrys own media and entertainment companies, as well as to improve Chinas image abroad. And the Chinese government is a master of control, known for strictly censoring Western media. This spring, with little warning or explanation, Chinese regulators shut down Apples digital book service and DisneyLife, a four-month-old subscription-based movie streaming service operated by Alibaba.Disney is going to extraordinary lengths to prove its commitment to China and the Communist Party. During a 2010 meeting with Chinas propaganda minister, Mr. Iger pledged to use the companys global platform to introduce more about China to the world. And he has done just that.Disney is working with Chinas Ministry of Culture to help develop the countrys animation industry and has agreed to work with Shanghai Media Group to make films for global audiences. Notably, Disney partnered with the state to produce Born in China, a film that promises to showcase to the world the spectacular wildlife and natural beauty of China, which a trailer depicts as snuggly baby pandas, snow leopards and lavish aerial shots of pristine mountain ranges.When global brands ask me what they need to do to improve their chances in China, I often paraphrase John F. Kennedy: Ask not what China can do for your business, but what your business can do for China, said John A. Quelch, who teaches at Harvard Business School and has extensive experience in China. They need to demonstrate that they are willing to promote things the government is interested in.Mr. Iger is trying especially to give Shanghai Disney some Chinese flair. He instructed park designers to infuse as many Chinese elements as possible.Builders collected indigenous trees from all around China, including a 59-foot chestnut oak from Zhejiang Province, to adorn the grounds. A Tarzan show was directed by Li Xining, an acrobatics expert who once worked for the Chengdu Military Area Command under the Peoples Liberation Army. The Broadway version of The Lion King will be performed entirely in Mandarin  a first.Mr. Iger even came up with a new slogan for the Shanghai resort, calling it authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese. He repeats the phrase constantly when talking about the site, and Disney executives in Shanghai have posted it around their offices. It is supposed to be a sign of respect for China and its people.What are we doing here that will make this park successful in China? Mr. Iger said at an investor event in May. One of the critical elements was making it distinctly Chinese, making sure that the people who visit this park feel that its theirs."}
{"text": "LONDON  After years of international isolation under the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya sought to emulate its Middle Eastern neighbors by creating a sovereign wealth fund in 2006 to invest the proceeds from its sale of oil.The North African nation soon turned to Goldman Sachs to help it invest some of the more than $35 billion in funds it had available in late 2007.That relationship soured after the Libyan Investment Authority said it was misled by the Wall Street bank in 2008 about a series of derivatives transactions and ultimately lost $1.2 billion when those contracts came to maturity in 2011.Goldman Sachs, by comparison, earned more than $200 million in eye-watering profit on the transactions, the sovereign fund asserted in a trial that began on Monday in London.The Libyan Investment Authority, unlike many sovereign wealth funds, said that it was an unsophisticated investor with a staff that had little experience with investment banking and that Goldman Sachs preyed on the navet of its staff to persuade the fund to invest in complex transactions that they didnt understand or desire.On Monday, Roger Masefield, a lawyer for the Libyan Investment Authority, argued that Goldman used training programs; gifts; trips to Dubai, London and Morocco; and an internship for the younger brother of the funds deputy executive officer to win favor and convince the fund to engage in the investments.This is a highly unusual case, Mr. Masefield said.The trial is being heard in the High Court in London before Justice Vivien Rose and is expected to last about seven weeks. The lawsuit was first filed in London two years ago.Goldman has disputed the claims and says that the Libyan Investment Authority had the financial sophistication to understand the disputed transactions and other similarly complicated transactions it engaged in.The dispute revolves around nine derivatives transactions tied to the stocks of Citigroup, the French utility EDF and other companies.The Libyan fund entered into the transactions in 2007 and in 2008 in the months before the financial crisis and ultimately lost its investment as the economic downturn weighed on the stock prices of the companies in the disputed transactions.At the time, Libya was looking to engage with the global markets after years of political isolation and stagnant development.The Libyan Investment Authority soon developed a close relationship with Goldman and by mid-2007 considered it not only a trusted adviser, but as almost an in-house bank, according to the Libyan Investment Authoritys assertions.The Libyan Investment Authority, like the sovereign wealth funds of other developing countries, was seeking to purchase strategic stakes in global companies that could be partners for its future development, according to court filings. That included financial companies.In its filings, the Libyan Investment Authority argued that Goldman was aware of the financial navet of its staff, citing emails in which one banker said the fund had zero-level sophistication and another banker who said you just delivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels.Much of the funds arguments centered on the actions of Youssef Kabbaj, a former Goldman Sachs banker.The Libyan Investment Authority said that Mr. Kabbaj wined and dined members of the funds staff on training trips to London, which included accommodations in a stylish hotel and frequent expensive meals out at many of Londons best-known restaurants.In one instance, his expenses for entertaining and hotels exceeded 22,000 pounds, or about $31,000, and he was reminded internally at Goldman that any expenses incurred with respect to the Libyan fund needed prior approval, according to court filings.Mr. Kabbaj also bought staff members of the fund presents and took them on vacation to Morocco, according to the court filings.Mr. Masefield argued that Mr. Kabbaj also worked on both sides of the derivatives transactions, ghost writing documents for staff members of the fund to be used to convince its board of directors to invest and then separately making presentations to the fund on behalf of Goldman Sachs.The Libyan fund also argued that Goldman tried to win influence by providing an internship to Haitem Zarti, the younger brother of Mustafa Zarti, the funds deputy executive officer.This very internship has been, and may still be, the subject of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Goldman Sachs appears to be carrying out its own internal investigation into its hiring practices, the fund said in court filings.According to court filings, Mr. Kabbaj entertained Haitem Zarti in London on his Goldman Sachs expense account and took him on vacations to Morocco. The Libyan fund said that Goldman Sachs paid for Haitem Zartis business class flights and 5-star accommodations on a trip to Dubai and Mr. Kabbaj arranged for a pair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening on that trip."}

The ceremony was also broadcast within 18 hours of the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., giving award-winners and presenters a platform to address a national tragedy.The host, James Corden, opened the ceremony with a poignant, 45-second speech addressing the shooting. Hate will never win, he said. Together we have to make sure of that. Tonights show stands as a symbol and a celebration of that principle.The show then kicked off with a Hamilton spoof, with Mr. Corden, host of CBSs The Late Late Show, at the center.The 8.7 million viewers represented a 35 percent jump over last year, which drew 6.5 million.In an interview last week with The New York Post, CBSs chief executive, Leslie Moonves, said that the Tonys were a money loser for the network but that it had no intention of dropping the broadcast.  I know this sounds corny, but part of being a broadcaster is public trust, he said in the interview. And I believe it is important for us to show America what is happening on Broadway."}
{"text": "The wind off the coast of Hammonasset Beach State Park in Connecticut ratcheted up to more than 20 miles an hour by sundown on Sunday, but in the early evening, it felt still enough to a group of four people to head out into Long Island Sound by kayak and paddle board for a dusk ride on the water.But the four, including a little girl, were swiftly overwhelmed by buffeting winds and strong tide that hauled them across the wide sound. By morning, two were dead and the other two  a woman and her 8-year-old daughter  were rescued nearly 20 miles away from where they launched, the police said. The two were found by a resident who heard them screaming for help after they washed up on a beach on Long Island.According to the Southold Town Police Department, the four, all Connecticut residents, spent the night battling waves as the vessels were carried across Long Island Sound.The woman, Delfina Reynoso, of Hartford, was found around 4 a.m. on Monday at Mulford Point in Orient, N.Y., with her daughter Damaris, said Martin Flatley, the police chief. They had hypothermia and were taken to Eastern Long Island Hospital for treatment.The excursion began at 6 p.m. on Sunday. Ms. Reynoso; her boyfriend, Abdias Ventura, 30, also of Hartford; and Damaris were in a kayak, and a companion, Ferdinand Lagos, 39, of Manchester, was on a paddle board. As soon as they left shore, Chief Flatley said, Ms. Reynoso told the police that they get caught up in the tide and the wind, and they start getting drawn out.They are paddling furiously and cant get back into Connecticut, he continued.Around 9 p.m., after three hours of fighting the current, Mr. Lagos decided to swim for shore, Chief Flatley said. His body was discovered Monday afternoon about five miles from the mouth of the Connecticut River, according to the United States Coast Guard.Chief Flatley said that the three others stayed with the kayak, but that it was taking on water. They drift with it across the sound, he said, adding that at some point, the adults got out of the kayak and clung to it, leaving the girl inside. The water temperature at the time was below 60 degrees. Hypothermia was most likely setting in, the chief said.Around midnight, Chief Flatly said, Mr. Ventura said he cant hold on anymore. Mr. Venturas body was found on a private beach a quarter-mile west of where the woman and her daughter were rescued.All four were wearing life jackets, Chief Flatley said.If you dont respect the water, he said, and know how the tides run and how the wind affects it, it can be very dangerous."}
{"text": "BEIJING  The Chinese police have recommended prosecution on a charge of subversion for Zhou Shifeng, a prominent lawyer whose arrest last year formed the focus of a campaign to discredit and dissolve networks of rights-focused defense lawyers who challenged the government, one of his former colleagues said on Monday.Nearly a year has passed since Mr. Zhou and other lawyers, legal associates and rights advocates were rounded up by the authorities, who accused them of abusing court proceedings and stirring up protests in a bid to win personal fame and discredit the Communist Party. About 25 remain in detention or missing, presumed detained, and their families and supporters have adamantly rejected the allegations, although they have had no access to the detainees.Over the weekend, the police told Mr. Zhous family that they had recommended indictment on suspicion of subverting state power, said Liu Xiaoyuan, a former colleague of Mr. Zhous, citing word from Mr. Zhous family. Mr. Liu said the subversion charge was particularly serious and, if successfully prosecuted, could lead to a prison term of at least a decade.The charge suggested that under President Xi Jinping, the government would continue its intense drive to silence organizations and activists who even a few years ago survived in a margin of official tolerance, said Maya Wang, a researcher on China for Human Rights Watch.This kind of grave political crime, reserved for organizers of political parties in the past, is now used on a much wider range of civil society actors, showing how much space for activism has shrunk under Xis reign in just three years, Ms. Wang said by email.On Monday, the Chinese government and Communist Party also jointly issued broad guidelines for reforming the legal profession, in a document that stressed demands for lawyers to be both honest professionals and loyal enforcers of the Communist Partys policies.Always make adherence to the leadership of the Communist Party and support for socialist rule of law a fundamental requirement for serving as a lawyer, said a summary of guidelines, issued by Xinhua, the official news agency.Mr. Zhou led a law firm in Beijing that took on many contentious cases about legal rights, as well as conventional commercial work. One other lawyer at his firm, as well as an intern and an assistant, were also arrested on subversion charges in January.Liberal critics of Mr. Xi and foreign officials have also raised worries that a recently passed law on foreign nongovernment organizations may be used to cut back the room for international groups to operate in China. Secretary of State John Kerry raised those concerns in meetings in Beijing last week.Last week, prosecutors also revealed a trial date for Xia Lin, a prominent lawyer in Beijing whose clients included Ai Weiwei, the famed artist whose work often takes up politically-charged subjects. Mr. Xia would face trial on fraud charges in Beijing on Friday, Ding Xikui, one of his defense lawyers, said by telephone on Monday.He will maintain his innocence, Mr. Ding said.Mr. Xia was detained by the police in November 2014 and later charged with fraud over a loan. But his wife, Lin Ru, and other rights lawyers have said the charges are groundless and an attempt to silence Mr. Xia.Now prosecutors have up to one and a half months to decide whether to take Mr. Zhou to court on the charge of subversion, Mr. Liu said. Chinese courts rarely find defendants innocent, especially in politically contentious cases.They could send it back to the public security organs for additional investigation, or they could initiate prosecution if they decide the facts are clear and the crime has been established, Mr. Liu said in a telephone interview. There is the possibility that theyll send it back for more investigations; the case has already dragged on this long.But Mr. Liu said that it was unlikely that the police and prosecutors would decide to prosecute Mr. Zhou on a lesser charge and that sticking to the more serious one, subversion, would set an example for the other lawyers and activists under investigation.Mr. Zhou and many other people detained in the crackdown last year are being held in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing. His court-appointed lawyer there, Yang Yufu, did not answer repeated phone calls on Monday."}
{"text": "Cocooning the entire lower floor of Zurichs Galerie Gmurzynska, an installation conceived by Zaha Hadid opens this week that is part iceberg, part cave and part shrine, created in homage to the influential Dadaist artist Kurt Schwitters. Inspired by Schwitterss destroyed Merzbau (1923-1937), an ever-changing collage sculpture that consumed his entire workspace, Hadid designed an all-encompassing grotto on which to show the artists works. As with the Merzbau, Hadids structural collage includes artworks as well as readymade furniture and architectural features. Here, the artworks are assemblages and reliefs from across Schwitterss career, as well as a selection of illustrated and often surreal personal correspondence. Theyre offset by Hadids furniture: undulating marble tables, modular seating elements and hybrid shelving systems that swoop and curve like melting glaciers.Hadid worked on the show, which is timed to coincide with citywide centenary celebrations of the Dada movement, with the gallery director Mathias Rastorfer before her untimely death in March. Obviously she died before it was finished: all the ideas were there, the concepts were there, we had talked about every detail, but it hadnt been realized, Rastorfer explains. Its literally the last project of Zaha, finished by her team. Patrik Schumacher, senior designer and director of Zaha Hadid Architects, led the studio in completing the project, following an emotional conversation with Rastorfer at Hadids funeral.Schumacher had worked closely with Hadid since 1988, and sees the architects deep interest in modern art as having played a formative role in her vision. Zaha Hadids most radical expansion of design repertoires for architecture and urbanism is inspired by an explosion of possibilities through early abstract art movements at the beginning of the century, he explains. Schumacher identifies a number of signature elements in Hadids design vocabulary that can be traced back to Dada and allied art movements, from the manipulation of perspective, through the explosion of shapes away from a fixed point, to the concept of a building as a single flowing landscape. He also sees Hadids appreciation of chance and chaos as coming directly from the thought experiments of the modern avant-garde. Every now and then we need radical brainstorming mutation sessions where we have to give ourselves up and allow ourselves to be thrust and pushed out of that space of preconception, he says. I think thats the profound message of Dada.This is not Hadids first collaboration with Gmurzynska. Seven years ago, she designed a Kazimir Malevich exhibition for the venerable gallery, and her relationship with director Mathias Rastorfer was apparently both close and forthright. During the planning stages of this project, Hadid contacted Rastorfer requesting that he intercede to rescue the only Schwitters structure still in existence (the Merz Barn in Englands Lake District). He dutifully obliged: I made a donation of 25,000 to have Merz Barn restored  it was all Zahas idea."}
{"text": "It was at Coney Islands Freak Bar, in the summer of 2010, where I last thought that riding a roller coaster was a good idea.What followed would forever be known as the Cyclone incident, at least to my loved ones and me, including the friend who, after we shared a steady stream of sangria, convinced me that Coney Islands creaky landmark was the perfect beginners coaster. It wasnt.At Nathans Famous, after the most terrifying one minute and 50 seconds of my life, nauseated and strangely sore, I conceded: Roller coasters were not for me.Its something I always knew to be true but could never fully admit. I still wanted to believe that I could have fun at an amusement park, because whats the point of going if I couldnt get my thrill on? After all, I could enjoy a Nathans hot dog elsewhere minus the nausea, embarrassment and price of admission.It still pains me to think of my high school senior class trip to Universal Orlando in 1999, where I was the only member of my class who refused to ride. An empathetic friend kept me company, and we tried to replace the coaster experience with 3-D rides featuring the likes of Spider-Man and the Terminator, but the charity-case vibe took much of the fun out of that.But as a recent trip to Hersheypark to reclaim some lost childhood joy confirmed, amusement parks, and theme parks in particular, can still be fulfilling, especially if you can shed the shame that often accompanies those of us who prefer both feet on the ground.I always assumed that coasters were the main draw at amusement parks, but it turns out that having an appealing theme may be the most important factor in a parks success.While, maybe, roller coasters are the single most popular type of attraction, theyre really not the things that drive attendance to the top parks in the country, said Robert Niles, the editor of ThemeParkInsider.com. Its more the characters, the brand names, its the stuff you go to Disney and Universal to see.The resulting focus on noncoaster activities is an obvious boon to folks like me.While Disney has Mickey and Universal Studios has Harry Potter, Hersheypark and its related attractions have a common thread with even more widespread appeal: chocolate.I just happen to really like chocolate, as does my wife, who joined me on this trip, so you can imagine our joy in being able to build our own custom chocolate bars, right down to the labels design, at Hersheys Chocolate World. If you must know, I went with classic milk chocolate with pretzel bits and chocolate cookie bits (no sprinkles).Parks that can offer these types of one-off experiences, along with an assortment of other engaging activities, are the ones to look for.Were really three parks in one, said Kathleen McGraw, director of communication for Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, referring to Hersheypark, its Boardwalk sections water attractions and the ZooAmerica North American Wildlife Park.In addition, just outside the park, in Hershey, Pa., is the before-mentioned Chocolate World, which also offers a chocolate-making tour, a tasting session and a huge gift shop. Also nearby is the Hershey Story museum, which offers a chocolate lab class, and the 23-acre Hershey Gardens, which, in addition to its botanical offerings, has a great view overlooking the town.The most surprising activity available? The Falconry Experience, and it has absolutely nothing to do with chocolate.One does not have to scream to have a good time at an amusement park.Screaming is usually associated with horror films and roller coasters. This is why I usually look like Ive just watched a horror film on a roller coaster, the comedian Jim Gaffigan wrote in his book Dad Is Fat.I do enjoy horror films, but the great thing there is I dont have to have an actual encounter with, say, a demonic clown to get a rush. With coasters, watching a clip of others scream while dropping 300 feet at over 100 miles per hour is enough to get my blood flowing.Our trip to Hersheypark was the first time that I felt guilt-free heading into an amusement-park experience, because I have since accepted that people are just wired differently, and not liking roller coasters is nothing to be ashamed of.The old me would have come up with excuses like: Kim Jong-un apparently loves roller coasters, and that kind of bothers me. The new me approached the parks other attractions with fresh eyes.I was able to enjoy lovely views from the parks 250-foot-high Kissing Tower and Ferris wheel, rides that used to feel like a lame consolation prize.I also indulged in mild thrills at the Boardwalk, like a leisurely float down the Intercoastal Waterway, and traditional park games like Skee-Ball and Pro Shot satisfied the kid in me (though the giant stuffed animal prizes still eluded me).It certainly helped that there was zero peer pressure from my wife to reconsider coasters.Mr. Niles, the expert from ThemeParkInsider, has visited about 40 parks around the world and doesnt pressure his friends or family either, though he does encourage people who have never ridden a coaster to try at least once.If theyve done coasters before and they say, no, I just dont like them, I respect that and then point them toward something else, Mr. Niles said. Thats why good parks have a variety of things to do.Some things you will always be able to get at an amusement park: cotton candy; hot dogs; fried dough; a really bad stomachache. In fact, chicken tenders remain one of the most popular orders at Hersheypark, ice cream being the most popular, according to Ms. McGraw. But many parks have also responded to the continuing popularity of fast-casual restaurants by offering higher-quality options.Most parks, at this point, have really tried to upgrade food over the years, Mr. Niles said. You can still get a lousy, cheap meal at any theme park if thats what youre looking for. But if youre looking for something nice, its there at the major theme parks.Along these same lines, parks have continued to work in popular local brands and area specialties. For example, Coney Island added a Grimaldis Pizza in 2012, and last year, Carowinds in Charlotte, N.C., introduced Carolina staples like shrimp and grits to its menus.Were always looking at incorporating chocolate, but also local and regional favorites, said Kathy Burrows, a manager of public relations for Hersheypark.Among the highlights there are the crabfries (seasoned crinkle-cut fries with a cheese dipping sauce) from Chickies & Petes, a popular sports bar chain based in Philadelphia that opened its second stand this year.The whoopie pie, which nearby Lancaster County claims among its creations, is another park fixture. It traditionally consists of two mound-shaped chocolate cakes brought together like a sandwich by a vanilla-cream filling. But starting this season, customers can get them with ice cream filling, or create their own, choosing from 12 fillings and eight cake shells. This allowed us to try what I am calling the inverted whoopie pie, which has vanilla shells and chocolate filling.Mr. Niles said that themed food was another trend, thanks to the success of Universals Wizarding World of Harry Potter and its Three Broomsticks restaurant.The most chocolately dining option at Hersheypark is Simply Chocolate, where you can eat all kinds of things that are dipped in chocolate, from Twizzlers to bacon, or overindulge with one of its 32-ounce King-Size Shakes.While I am at peace with the fact that I will most likely never again ride a coaster, I could change my mind. Maybe something less traumatic than the Cyclone would yield different results?I could also run for president, but I probably wont. But for those considering another try, there are tips that can help.Dont close your eyes, Mr. Niles said. Your eyes can help your body to be balanced. If youre closing your eyes, youre losing all of that input that your body needs to adapt.You can also pretend youre driving a car  one thats really long and extremely fast.Put your hands on that grab bar and put your foot down like youre pressing the gas, Mr. Niles said. Because youre just trying to create the feeling that you have control.I passed this advice on to my wife, who also does not like coasters but has yet to give up on them, and she said it worked.What also helped is that she chose a coaster, the Trail Blazer, which is on the lower end of the thrill meter.Hersheypark conveniently rates its adult rides on a scale from mild to aggressive thrill, so we were able to easily identify a coaster that was less likely to overwhelm.My wifes success gave me a little bit of hope. But for now, Im still rating every coaster I see a 0, as in: there is a zero chance Im getting on that thing. But the chocolate-covered bacon? Easily a 10.The closest airport is Harrisburg International Airport, roughly a 20-minute drive to Hersheypark. We drove from New York City, which took three hours.

{"text": "Goals from Emanuele Giaccherini and Graziano Pelle, combined with excellent defending in Lyon, France, helped Italy beat Belgium, 2-0, in its first match at the European Championships on Monday.Described as one of the worst Italian teams ever by the countrys news media, Manager Antonio Contes aging squad defied the odds to take the lead in Group E with an impressive display.Second-ranked Belgium, which fielded a team with top Premier League players including Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, dominated the games early stages but was forced to pay for errors by a makeshift defense and a lack of finishing up front.Italy, the 2006 World Cup champion, finally broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when Leonardo Bonucci found Giaccherini inside the Belgium penalty area with a lofted long ball over the defense. Giaccherini controlled it with a fine touch and curled his shot past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Pelle made it 2-0 in extra time with a well-struck volley after a counterattack.Spain 1, Czech Republic 0 Gerard Pique finally broke down the Czech Republics stubborn defense in the final minutes in Toulouse, France, giving Spain, the two-time defending champions, an opening victory at the European Championships.Pique ran behind the defenders and headed the ball into the net after a well-placed cross by Andres Iniesta in the 87th minute.Spain had created a series of scoring chances throughout the Group D match at the Stadium de Toulouse. But victory looked unlikely after a combination of poor finishing and a superb performance from Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech.The Czechs had a chance to break the deadlock in the 65th minute, but midfielder Cesc Fbregas saved Spain with a goal-line clearance after a header by Theodor Gebre Selassie.Mexico 1, Venezuela 1 Jess Manuel Coronas goal in the 80th minute in Houston gave Mexico a 1-1 tie against Venezuela and first place in Group C of the Copa Amrica Centenario. By winning the group, El Tri most likely avoids a quarterfinal matchup with the tournament favorite Argentina.After missing several opportunities to score, Corona took on five defenders and fired a shot from 10 yards out to thrill the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd.Jos Manuel Velzquez gave Venezuela the early lead by volleying in a headed assist from Christian Santos in the 10th minute. Venezuela had a chance to take the lead in the 84th minute, but goalkeeper Jos de Jess Corona saved a bicycle kick by Josef Martnez.Uruguay 3, Jamaica 0 Uruguays Abel Hernndez and Matas Corujo scored and Jamaica added an own goal in Santa Clara, Calif., in a battle between two Group C teams that could not advance in the Copa Amrica.Sentencing for Rioters A Marseille court convicted six English soccer fans and handed prison sentences ranging from one to three months to five of them for involvement in rioting at the European Championships in recent days.The swift trials and sentencing appeared aimed at sending a message to potential hooligans for the rest of the monthlong tournament being played throughout France."}
{"text": "When President Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India met last week at the White House, many analysts puzzled over how and why the two leaders, so different in so many ways, get along. Whatever the reasons, whats important is that they have significantly deepened the partnership between their two countries. It may be one of Mr. Obamas most important foreign policy achievements.Relations between America and India, testy during the Cold War, warmer under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, are now producing concrete gains under Mr. Obama. The two democracies are finding common cause in countering Chinas aggression in the South China Sea, resisting climate change, fighting terrorism and investing in each others economic growth.The environmental community and indeed anyone worried about global warming found much to cheer in Mr. Obamas and Mr. Modis promise to work together to realize the potential of Decembers Paris treaty on climate change, and in particular Mr. Modis agreement for a more aggressive timetable for phasing out heat-trapping climate pollutants known as hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in vehicle and household air conditioners.Both sides also promised to keep driving the expansion of renewable energy sources. In Paris, India pledged to invest heavily in wind and solar power, and in just the first six months of this year has installed more solar capacity than it did all last year. The two sides also announced two new programs, to be jointly financed, to attract new private investment in renewables and to provide renewable energy to Indian villages that are not connected to the grid.No less important is the growing cooperation between the two countries on defense issues. The United States formally recognized India as a major defense partner, making it eligible to buy some of the most sophisticated American-made weapons and technology without first having to receive a license. The two countries have stepped up joint military exercises. If there was any doubt that a message to China was intended, Mr. Modi told Congress that India appreciated Americas role in Asia and endorsed its commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, which Beijing is claiming largely as its own.The two sides also announced plans to complete a deal under which India will buy six nuclear reactors from Westinghouse by June 2017, thus fulfilling a promise India made when it persuaded Mr. Bush in 2005 to lift an American ban on selling nuclear technology to India. The deal has dragged on for years.Other vital issues will need work, now and far into the future, including the India-Pakistan-China nuclear competition that threatens the region. It will be up to the next president to build on a relationship that is on stronger footing now than it has been for some time."}
{"text": "Satya Nadella, the Microsoft chief executive, may have abandoned his prudent approach.His $26.2 billion deal to buy LinkedIn could reinvigorate the software giants slipping grip on corporate computer systems and employee interactions. Paying a nearly 50 percent premium for a flawed business raises several red flags, however.The Windows operating system and Office software suite once gave Microsoft a chokehold over corporate computing. But the growth of the cloud and mobile devices has thrown the market wide open  first to alternative operating environments, and more recently to new collaborative software that threatens Microsofts email, word processing and spreadsheet revenue. The companys efforts to move users to cloud versions of its programs may help, but its traditional dominance is under attack.Buying LinkedIn means Microsoft will control the best-known network where companies and employees  especially potential employees  interact. Making the LinkedIn bazaar operate smoothly with tools like Office, Skype and other services run on Microsofts Azure platform is the overarching vision.LinkedIn has problems, though. Less than a year ago, its stock was trading nearly 30 percent higher than the agreed offer price of $196 a share. A growth warning, the reputational damage of a huge security breach and the introduction of new features that provide revenue but annoy users have hurt the company. The boards decision to sell suggests the stand-alone outlook was not especially alluring.Microsofts history with acquisitions raises questions, too. It has written down essentially the entire $9.5 billion it paid for Nokia. In 2012, it wrote off nearly all the $6.3 billion shelled out for digital-advertising agency aQuantive. Those deals were sealed by Mr. Nadellas predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, and it may be that the current chief executive will prove more attentive to integration.But the LinkedIn deal is the biggest Microsoft has ever tried. Making such transactions pay off is tough, especially when the sellers adviser, Frank Quattrones Qatalyst Partners, is known for scoring improbably high prices.Its also hard to see past the news-release drivel. Mr. Nadella says the merger could increase growth as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet. As for LinkedIn, today is a re-founding moment according to Reid Hoffman, a co-founder and board member. Concrete indications of the deals financial benefits are in worryingly short supply."}
{"text": "Ted Elliott, a gay college senior from Maine, said he was not jumping to conclusions that the Orlando mass shooting was a hate crime against gay people or an act of terrorism. Mr. Elliott, a self-described liberal, blamed weak gun laws for endless violence.Shooting A is the same as Shooting B is the same as Shooting C, said Mr. Elliott, 21.Yet for Leonard Faucher, a Donald J. Trump supporter in Houston, the rampage was clearly terrorism.All of this is a clash between the cultures, said Mr. Faucher, 69, referring to Islam and the United States.The location of the attacks, a popular gay club, proved the killers motive to Corrie Yackulic, a lawyer who lives near Seattle.Its an anti-gay bias, said Ms. Yackulic, 58. If youre trying to take down the American government, you dont attack a gay bar in Orlando.Rarely has American reaction to a human tragedy been as divided as the striking and complex array of opinions about the deaths of 49 people in Orlando. While gun violence often cleaves people into predictable, politically identifiable camps, and terrorist attacks tend to unite countries in grief and resolve, Orlando has so far defied easy categorizations and conclusions.Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, for instance, seized on the attacks on Monday to renew his call for a ban on Muslim immigration, but he also lavished empathy on gay people  many of whom oppose his bid  and defended their desire to love who they want and express their identity.His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and many party leaders argued that fighting homegrown terrorists required tougher gun laws. Yet some liberals and intellectuals argued that gun control was not the only problem, noting that there were parts of Islam and the Quran hostile to homosexuality.The left is very worried about homophobia but its also very worried about Islamophobia, so there is going to be some real cognitive dissonance on the left as people talking about a Muslim killing many gay people, said Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business.And many gay people, while agreeing that Orlando was a terrorist attack, said they were offended that some Republican officials have refused to acknowledge that the massacre could be considered a hate crime  or even to use the word gay in talking about it. In remarks from the Capitol on Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, condemned the Islamic State as a group that crucifies children and beheads women but notably omitted any mention of gays.In Britain on Sunday, an openly gay journalist stormed off the set of Sky News program, which was founded by Rupert Murdoch, after becoming frustrated that the shows host was portraying Orlando as an attack on the freedom of all people rather than discussing it as an attack on L.G.B.T. people.The conversations in America and overseas were in stark contrast to the aftermath of the killings of 26 children and staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, when virtually everyone was talking about gun control and mental health. After the attacks last fall in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., the global conversation turned to radicalized Muslims bent on terrorist attacks. And violence against gay, lesbian and transgender people has led to frequent and alarmed discussions among gay people.No such clarity exists around Orlando, at least for now. As people absorb the dimensions of the attack, it is hard to predict how most Americans will be talking about it in a week or month, let alone around the presidential election in November.Its probably along the lines of all three equally, said Tina Weidenhammer, 33, of Chicago, a lesbian who has a dog-walking business. She said she and her friends were inspired by the support from family members, but worried that Orlando could have a ripple effect for gay people.Our concern is, this is open hunting season if you really wanted to go after gays, Ms. Weidenhammer, noting the many Gay Pride Month festivals in June. We are more concentrated and congregating publicly with, literally, our colors.In interviews with about 20 Americans across the country on Monday, most said they were still trying to make sense of the attack and viewed it as more complicated than other recent terrorist events. Several also predicted that it would become a defining part of the presidential race. Ioanna Hawk, 41, a schoolteacher and costume designer who lives in Pasadena, Calif., said she was concerned not only that the access to guns is too much for potential terrorists and others in America, but also that Orlando would be exploited for political gain.One of the first things I thought when it happened was, Trumps going to use this to get more votes, she said.Trump campaign advisers insisted on Monday that the candidate was not trying to use the gunman, Omar Mateen, for political advantage, but attempting to speak bluntly about the ties between recent attacks and Muslim immigration.And several supporters of Mr. Trump called his comments refreshing because he was willing to highlight radicalized Muslims  rather than speak more generally about terrorism and gun violence. They also praised his comments on Monday noting that gay people, like other Americans, were targets of Muslim terrorists.Obviously, the lefties immediately see an opportunity to yell about gun control and somehow think people will believe that gun confiscation will end all this violence, said Paul Chevalier, a retired officer in the Marines who is active in Republican politics in New Hampshire. Obama refuses to link any of this terrorism to Islam or even radical Islam, so I think most Americans are beginning to think that Trump is our best hope for ever defeating this scourge on the world.Deirdre McCloskey, a transgender woman who is an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said she shuddered at the thought of Mr. Trump gaining mileage as a result of the shooting.I take Orlando as terrorism, that is, violence for a political purpose. It especially disturbs me as a citizen of a democracy, not as a queer. That is why The Donalds immediate use of the fears it arouses to further his plans for fascist-leaning populism alarms me, she said. It can happen here.The breadth of reactions did not surprise some experts in human behavior. Professor Haidt noted studies showing that peoples reaction to scientific evidence was very different depending on whether they saw the policy implications of the science as politically desirable.So when we hear news reports, we dont decide what happened and then decide what to do about it, he said. Rather, we know what we want to do, and we interpret what happened in the way that will best help us do what we want to do."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  President Obama said Monday that while the gunman in the Orlando massacre had declared allegiance to the Islamic State and appeared to have been inspired by extremist information on the internet, there was no clear evidence that he had been part of a wider plot directed by the terrorist group.As far as we can tell right now, this is certainly an example of the kind of homegrown extremism that all of us have been so concerned about for a very long time, Mr. Obama said, speaking in the Oval Office after a briefing with law enforcement, counterterrorism and Homeland Security officials.Mr. Obama said the mass shooting in Orlando  which he will visit on Thursday to pay his respects to victims families, the White House announced on Monday night  was being investigated as an act of terrorism. The president said the attack on Sunday by Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded more than 50, was similar to last years rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., in which the perpetrators claimed allegiance to the Islamic State beforehand but had no direct connection to it.The president said of Mr. Mateen that we see no clear evidence that he was directed externally by the Islamic State, although he declared fealty to the group at the last minute.Still, Mr. Obama said the attack underscored the Islamic States power to inspire hateful acts.One of the biggest challenges we are going to have is this kind of propaganda and perversions of Islam that you see generated on the internet, and the capacity for that to seep into the minds of troubled individuals, or weak individuals, and seeing them motivated then to take actions against people here in the United States and elsewhere in the world, Mr. Obama said.Law enforcement officials were scrutinizing the material Mr. Mateen had come across online to better understand his path to murder, the president said.Mr. Obama, anguished by the latest mass shooting during his tenure  a period in which Congress has rejected calls to enact tougher gun rules  said the Orlando massacre should prompt Americans to think about the risks that we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country.We make it very easy for individuals who are troubled, or disturbed, or want to engage in violent acts to obtain very powerful weapons very easily, and its a problem, Mr. Obama said. He noted that it appeared Mr. Mateen had carried out the rampage with guns obtained legally, including an assault rifle he took out of the store the day it was purchased.But the attack highlighted how the politics of gun control has thwarted the presidents determination to enact stricter measures.The White House said Mr. Obama would be a forceful advocate for Congress to tighten gun restrictions. He supports legislation to bar firearms sales to people placed on no-fly lists because of suspected terrorism links and to require background checks for purchases at gun shows.But his aides strongly suggested that the president was out of options to impose additional limits on his own.The president is quite intensely frustrated that we havent seen the kind of congressional action that we know would have an impact on mass shootings, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The responsibility right now lies with Congress.Mr. Obama also said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has faced some criticism for failing to stop the attack even though Mr. Mateen had been investigated in recent years for potential links to terrorist groups, had acted appropriately.The White House declined to respond to suggestions from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on Monday that Mr. Obama had refused to acknowledge Islamic terrorism and might have ulterior motives for doing so.When you are focused on something as big as safeguarding the country and combating violent extremism, Mr. Earnest said of the president, its important not to get distracted by things that are so small.He said Mr. Obamas record speaks for itself, and that record includes a lot of dead terrorists."}
{"text": "ORLANDO, Fla.  Louis Omar Ocasio-Capo was 20, worked at a Starbucks in a Target store, and lived to dance. Stanley Almodovar III, a 23-year-old pharmacy technician, had posted a Snapchat video of himself singing and laughing on his way to the Pulse nightclub on Saturday. Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36, nicknamed Shaki, had been married to his husband for about a year, worked at a Party City and a Sunglass Hut, and was entranced by interior design.The dead were mostly young, mostly Latino and mostly gay  though some were none of those and a fair number were straight men and women enjoying an evening of Latin music. And on Monday, when their names were read aloud in the auditorium of a red-brick senior center, the worst fears of their families came true as the roster of the victims of the Orlando attack became horribly real.Juan Ramon Guerrero was less than a month shy of his 23rdbirthday and in his third year at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. He was quiet and kind, his uncle Robert Guerrero, 51, recalled. Like other members of his Dominican family, he liked Latin music, which is why he went to Pulse on Saturday night.He was not a party boy, Mr. Guerrero said. The family found out that Juan had been hurt when someone saw him being carried out of the club and into an ambulance. Family members began a frantic search. Finally, a hospital confirmed the awful news. The bereft uncle, like so many other relatives, turned to Facebook to pour out his rage.Once again the tentacles of death have touched our family, this time at the hands of a coward, a scoundrel, a disgusting human being without any scruples, he wrote.Cesar Flores, who moved to the United States from Guatemala in 1984 to chase what he called the American dream, learned around 1 a.m. Monday that his only daughter, Mercedez Marisol Flores, 26, had died in the club along with a girlfriend, Amanda Alvear, 25.She was my best, my only girl, Mr. Flores, who has two sons, said quietly, with evident grief, outside the Beardall Senior Center, where he was to receive help with arrangements to receive his daughters body for burial. She was a happy girl all the time, but now shes gone.The attacker, Mr. Flores said, should be forgiven. I cannot hang on to that hate, he said. Its not weapons that kill  its the heart. That kind of hate is in the blood.As he spoke, two people nearby hugged each other for a long time and sobbed. From the front door of the building, a procession of relatives and friends emerged after the briefing, heads bowed. Each family was surrounded by a team of church volunteers in bright T-shirts, their hands linked to protect their charges from reporters questions.One woman, Eileen Villega, said the name of a family friend who had been in the nightclub, Angel L. Candelario-Padro, 27, had not appeared on any of the lists of dead or injured. His boyfriend is in the hospital, but he doesnt appear anywhere, she said. Later, after she had left, his name was indeed found listed among the dead.Orlando is a city that cannot be divorced from its tourist attractions, among them Disney World and Universal Studios, where some of the victims were employed. Xavier Emmanuel Serrano Rosado, 35, was the father of a young son and worked at DisneyLive!, according to his Facebook page. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that he had danced in the Atlanta Bachata Fest, a celebration of Latin dance and music.Luis S. Vielma, 22, worked on a Harry Potter ride at Universal Studios, and was mourned on Twitter by the author J.K. Rowling. He was also an emergency medical student at Seminole State College, whose president, E. Ann McGee, was among several college presidents who found themselves issuing statements of sorrow on Monday, a testimony to the youth lost in the rampage.We are saddened by the tragic events this weekend, and the loss of one of our own, Dr. McGee said.Shane Evan Tomlinson, who often sang with his band, Frequency, at Orlandos Blue Martini nightclub, performed just hours before he was killed. Friends and fellow singers struggled to process the news of a charismatic life cut short.Were all really feeling that numbness right now, and just the shock, said Deejay Young, who met Mr. Tomlinson in a gospel show at Epcot. It could have been any one of us.Jerald Arthur Wright, 31, was one of those Disney World cast members who seemed to never run out of energy for helping guests, and who, as a Spanish-speaking man whose family was from Ecuador, forged a particularly close bond with Latin American visitors.He was also straight, two friends who worked with Mr. Wright said. He had gone to Pulse on Saturday night to celebrate the birthday of a friend, Cory James Connell, 21, who was also killed.Its a great atmosphere, said Jessica Weyl, 23, a friend who is also straight and goes to Pulse occasionally. People arent judgmental. People arent feeling the need necessarily to impress each other.She added, At Pulse its just calm, cool, and collected. No one felt pressure to be anyone they werent. Im straight and I love going there. My brother is gay and he loves going there.Ms. Weyl had just finished training for a job in Tomorrowland when she met Mr. Wright.He took me under his wing and kind of showed me everything, she said. She turned to him for questions about Disney policies, but especially when she encountered a guest who spoke Spanish. He really connected with a lot of guests  we do have a lot of South Americans come, she said. He connected especially to those people.Mexicos Foreign Ministry confirmed Monday that three Mexicans were among the dead. The Mexican Consulate in Orlando was working to determine if a fourth victim was of Mexican origin.President Enrique Pea Nieto said the tragedys origins lay in expressions of hatred, of discrimination, of phobia against certain people.Many Latinos in Orlando are of Puerto Rican descent. Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34, was among them. He was proud of his heritage, and had made it his lifes mission to open doors for gay travelers, especially in Latin America. As the national brand manager for ALandCHUCK.travel, an agency that caters to gay people, he organized what the companys owner, Al Ferguson, called the first-ever gay cruise to Cuba. He fell in love with Cuba, Mr. Ferguson said.During the trip, in April, Mr. Sotomayor and Mr. Ferguson met with Mariela Castro, Ral Castros daughter and a prominent gay rights activist there. The two men also posed in front of a poster left over from President Obamas recent trip.On Sunday morning at Pulse, Mr. Sotomayors boyfriend of about three years had gone outside to put some things in his car when the shots broke out. Mr. Sotomayor texted him that he was hiding, but safe, and told him not to come back inside, Mr. Ferguson said. About 25 minutes later, he texted his boyfriend again, saying he was still hiding. That was the last message the boyfriend got.Mr. Ferguson said the boyfriends parents, who live in Mexico, do not know he is gay.Its a double catastrophe, he said. You face such horrible loss and then cant share it."}
{"text": "BUENOS AIRES  Argentina is changing political direction again, in a century-old zigzag from left to right and back. Traumatic though this obsessive ritual is, what is most amazing is that the language almost never changes: The powers that be are corrupt. Throw them out.This holds true across the political spectrum. Charged with corruption, an incumbent is ousted by voters or a coup. An appearance in court often follows, but the investigation goes nowhere at the hands of politically wary investigators or judges. Eventually, the reformers are themselves tarred with corruption charges, and the cycle repeats itself.The current turnabout features the populist Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, who was president from 2007 to last year, and her husband, Nstor, who preceded her from 2003 to 2007 and died in 2010. Her center-right successor, Mauricio Macri, ran on promises of ending their alleged corruption and fixing Argentinas economy. The outcome: Ms. Kirchner has been indicted on charges of organizing a currency trade at an artificially low price that benefited rich investors and cost Argentinas Central Bank billions of dollars. Meanwhile, television news is rife with images of earth movers digging up a Patagonian farm where a vast Kirchner fortune is rumored to be buried. Other Kirchner-era officials are accused of bribe taking, embezzling and misappropriating public funds.Does this mean Mrs. Kirchner is forever humbled? Hardly. A large slice of the population still sees her as a champion of the underprivileged  and a strong potential contender for president in 2019.Extraordinary as this may appear to outsiders, none of it is new to Argentines.Nasty political divides date from Argentinas independence from Spain early in the 19th century, a time of bloody disputes between advocates of local authority or strong central rule. Revolts and civil wars followed each other, as landlords battled rival landlords, using gauchos  mounted cowhands  as soldiers.In the 20th century, enduring rifts opened between caudillos  commanding figures who appealed to the masses  and more elitist leaders, with all sides typically saying their foes were corrupt. In 1930, after the progressive president Hiplito Yrigoyen was overthrown in a military coup, he was imprisoned on charges involving fraudulent government purchases. But none of the accusations were proved.In the 1940s and 50s, the populist general Juan Pern and his second wife, Eva, accused oligarchs of exploiting the working class. Generals aligned with the upper class that the Perns vilified ousted Mr. Pern from the presidency in 1955 and ordered an inquiry into allegations against him that included embezzlement of Argentine agricultural export earnings and sexual exploits with teenage girls. But even a lengthy investigation (and a posthumous public exhibition of Evas jewelry collection) did not yield conclusive findings.During the next 18 years, with Mr. Pern in exile in Madrid, military governments ousted successive elected presidents, typically citing corruption charges as justification.Mr. Pern returned to office in 1973, died a year later and was succeeded by Isabel Pern, his third wife. She was accused of pocketing proceeds from a government charity drive, and in 1976 was ousted in another coup  ostensibly to revive an economy depleted by the Perns populist policies.That was when Argentinas political split reached its nadir, with a barbarous descent by that military government into torture, murder and the disappearance of tens of thousands of opponents, many of them young. Only after the generals provoked a losing war with Britain over the Falkland Islands and incurred a crippling foreign debt did they step aside to permit democratic elections in 1983.A rare interlude followed. Amid wide revulsion at the recent horrors, Argentinas old hatreds seemed to dissipate when a middle-of-the-road president known for honesty, Rul Alfonsn, was elected.But the dream of a united Argentina didnt last. In 1989, Argentines elected as president Carlos Menem, a right-wing Peronist who drove around in a red Ferrari Testarossa he had received as a gift from Italian businessmen. He privatized the state-run telephone, gas, electricity and oil companies, and soon was embroiled in allegations of corruption. He didnt help his case when journalists asked about the Ferrari and he childishly replied: Its mine, mine, mine!Still, his reputation for corruption did not turn off voters. He even managed to change the Constitution to allow his re-election in 1995. A remark often heard about him explains a lot: Roba pero hace  He steals but he gets things done.Unfortunately, what he got done  radical free-market reforms  also created deep unemployment that outlasted his term in office. A foreign debt default and a catastrophic economic crash in 2001 prompted his successor, Fernando de la Ra, to call a state of emergency, resign and retire  after which he faced an unsuccessful prosecution on charges that he had bribed senators to approve a labor reform law.Which brings us back to the populist Ms. Kirchner, and Mr. Macris efforts to have Argentinas notoriously pliable judges investigate her now.Is Argentina finally tackling its endemic corruption? Its hard to say. Sebastin Casanello, the judge who ordered the Patagonia excavations, is also investigating Mr. Macri, since his name appears on the board of directors of an offshore company mentioned in the Panama Papers scandal.Nevertheless, when corruption and lurid accusations become so pervasive, a point is reached where they barely raise eyebrows. In Argentina, that juncture was passed long ago. Today, the glacially slow federal courts are honeycombed with judges often as corrupt as the politicians they investigate, says a leading anti-corruption crusader, Luis Moreno Ocampo. Its a system of judges, he says, who cover up corruption instead of investigating it.And the corruption thus enabled creates deep cynicism throughout the society.Consider Ren Favaloro, an Argentine heart surgeon in the 1960s, who pioneered a coronary bypass technique in Cleveland, then returned to Argentina to set up a cardiovascular foundation. His integrity and generosity (he operated on poorer patients free) became legendary.But those traits proved his undoing. When he refused to pay kickbacks demanded by health services officials, the state institute for pensioners refused to pay what it owed him for operations, leaving him at the brink of bankruptcy.I have been defeated by this corrupt society that controls everything, he wrote in a famous note saying hed rather die than take kickbacks. Then he shot himself through the heart.That was 16 years ago. Instead of succumbing again to the cyclical use of its prevalent corruption for political mudslinging, Argentina needs to tackle corruption at its core  to wage full-out war on an ancient malady eating away at a still-fragile democracy.That will require, before anything else, a truly independent judiciary that can quickly drop unfounded accusations and, when there is guilt, deliver more than token convictions that are intended mainly to discredit political opponents.Most important, the war must be waged against corruption wherever it occurs, not just among political enemies."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  An antipoverty agenda that Speaker Paul D. Ryan and House Republicans rolled out last week is based on a bedrock premise: The federal government has spent trillions of dollars over more than a half-century and has lost its war on poverty.But that premise is substantially undercut by separate studies from economists at Columbia University and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that show reductions of 40 percent or more in families living in poverty.Indeed, experts on social welfare policy say, these substantial gains in reducing poverty are not visible precisely because Republicans succeeded over the last decades in shifting government aid programs from direct cash assistance to benefits like food stamps and housing vouchers that are not counted in annual statistics.Republicans dont seem to catch on that this eliminates one of their talking points, said Ronald T. Haskins, who helped write the 1996 law overhauling the welfare system as a senior Republican staff member on the House Ways and Means Committee, and who later served as an adviser on welfare policy to President George W. Bush.The Republicans election-year agenda, called A Better Way, was also lacking in specific legislative proposals to address poverty.Details were left out, in part because of internal Republican policy disagreements and in part because of a general opposition among Republicans to any government spending.Liberal critics are even harsher, saying that Mr. Ryan and House Republicans were embracing a worn-out stereotype of the poor as criminal or lazy, and that they were putting emphasis on preventing fraud and abuse, which mostly just creates barriers to receiving needed help.I dont see anything here, said Timothy M. Smeeding, professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I see some broad generalities.Mr. Smeeding said that among the most crucial needs was employment assistance for able-bodied Americans who cannot get government benefits without working, but who find it difficult or impossible to get a job.I dont see any help, he said. I see a lot of hassling. If you get food stamps, we are going to hassle you to do a drug test for food stamps and God knows what else. Wheres the help? What are you doing here, Paul? Wheres the job guarantee?Some conservatives who have applauded Mr. Ryans proposal, such as Robert Doar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, said Mr. Ryans decision to focus on poverty might seem incongruous in the current political environment, particularly given the rise of Donald J. Trump.Mr. Doar, however, said that was a credit to Mr. Ryan.Theres a lot of middle-class economic anxiety, and House Republicans decided to focus on the difficulties of the poor, he said. I think they, at least in the speakers case, he and the Republicans have to be taken at face value. They think the problems of the poor are a really serious issue. He wasnt putting his finger up in the wind and saying how does this play politically.Mr. Doar did acknowledge that there could be more specifics, adding, Having Republicans talk about early child care or postsecondary education and talk about government as part of the solution, and work supports, to me that is a step in the right direction.Others said that Mr. Ryan and the Republicans needed to rethink their starting point and acknowledge the gains that have been made.On the war on poverty, the we fought a war on poverty, and poverty won idea, I think our work has sort of debunked that, said Christopher Wimer, the co-director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University.His research shows that poverty in America has fallen 40 percent since the 1960s. In the 1960s, most of the antipoverty programs we spent money on was actually cash, he said. Today, they come in the form of in-kind programs, food stamps or housing subsidies, or through the tax system, the earned-income tax credit, child tax credit or various other tax programs. Those simply arent counted.Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal budget analysis institute, said that Mr. Ryan seemed to have a sincere personal interest in addressing poverty, but that his view of poverty in America also seemed remarkably limited.They seem to focus on a small percentage of the poor who are some of the people with the most severe problems, such as crime and drug addiction, and then not just in their rhetoric but in their policy design, Mr. Greenstein said in an interview.Mr. Haskins said that Republicans should take credit for programs that have succeeded, especially the changes to the welfare system that put an emphasis on requiring work.I really think the main feature is that Republicans just dont like government, he said. Its hard for them to imagine that government works. They ought to give up this talking point.On this point, Mr. Haskins and Mr. Smeeding agreed.You should say this program works, Mr. Smeeding said of food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It works better than we thought before, and we should make it better and expand it.Mr. Ryan and House Republicans also strongly oppose any effort to raise the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour.Mr. Greenstein said the main basis for his skepticism of the plan was that Mr. Ryan and House Republicans have long pursued budget proposals that would cut trillions of dollars from programs intended to help the poor, and that Mr. Trump has put forward proposals that would require even deeper cuts.This absolutely doesnt square with their own budget, Mr. Greenstein said. Hes still for Trump because there would be a better chance of enacting his agenda.Well, part of Trumps policy platform is this $9 trillion-plus tax cut over 10 years, and Paul Ryan has always said he wants to balance the budget, he said. If you did a $9 trillion tax cut, you would have to have $9 trillion in new budget cuts on top of the budget cuts that are in the House Republican budget that already has the deepest cuts in antipoverty programs in modern American history."}
{"text": "Talk show hosts talk. After a mass murder, the pattern goes, they take a moment to talk more seriously. They talk about grief, love and hope. And then  this being their job  they move on to talk about something else.Monday night, as late-night shows aired their first episodes after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., there was a recurring theme: Talk is not enough anymore.From more freewheeling cable shows to the mainstream broadcasters, the prevailing message was that late-night hosts had been here so many times, after so many mass murders, the sad comics display of apolitical grief response had become shtick. You realize that you know what to say, Stephen Colbert said on CBS, because its been said too many times before.Samantha Bee, the host of Full Frontal on TBS, said that she was too angry to deliver some well-meaning words about how we will get through this together, how love wins, how love conquers hate. She continued: Love does not win unless we start loving each other enough to fix our [expletive] problems  starting, she argued, with restricting access to guns like the semiautomatic that Omar Mateen used to kill dozens of clubgoers.Ms. Bees political comedy has been blistering from the second Full Frontal began in February, and taking sides is her mission, much as it was on her alma mater, The Daily Show. (In his own commentary on the terrorist attack, Trevor Noah declared, America needs to make it a lot harder for people who shouldnt have guns to get guns.)What was new was the quaver in Ms. Bees voice  the barest suggestion that it was all she could do to keep it together even as she lashed the National Rifle Association and politicians who oppose gun regulations. Ms. Bee has been a one-woman punk band of rage, sarcasm and urgency; Mondays show added an acoustic note of heartbreak.Ms. Bees channel-mate, Conan OBrien, made a bigger departure. Never a particularly political host, he told his audience, I have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think. But on this night, he said, I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle.Hosts evolve over the years  David Letterman became more political in his later seasons  and Mr. OBrien has been at this since 1993. But he also now has the latitude afforded by a smaller cable audience. Its questionable whether, were he still hosting The Tonight Show, he would have been able to speak out the same way.Compare the emotional but conventional plea for peace and understanding offered by the current host of The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon: Maybe theres a lesson from all this, a lesson in tolerance. We need to support each others differences and worry less about our own opinions.On CBSs Late Show, Mr. Colberts reaction captured his delicate effort over the past year to find a middle ground between the sharp point of view of The Colbert Report and the more typical neutrality of late night.His monologue wasnt as prescriptive as Ms. Bees or Mr. OBriens, but it tiptoed up to the edge of  something. Opening behind his desk  a departure for his show  Mr. Colbert talked about love fighting despair, but with the suggestion that feeling, in itself, wasnt enough. Love the families and the victims and the people of Orlando, but lets remember that love is a verb. And to love means to do something.Mr. Colbert was saying not that love is itself an action, but that love requires acts to mean anything. It was an idea that wouldnt be out of place in a church group, and indeed, the former Sunday school teacher seemed to be trying to bring that experience to late night. Not to punt on the moral question or preach about it, but to think through a problem with his congregation.He continued that approach with his first guest, Fox Newss Bill OReilly, who had been scheduled before the attack. The conservative host was more eager to talk about the Islamic-extremism angle of the killings, whereas it became clear that for Mr. Colbert, do something meant, in part, getting powerful guns off the streets.Conservatives will notice, correctly, that late night was not exactly an N.R.A.-friendly zone. In his A Closer Look segment, Seth Meyers touted a Harvard study that linked more gun availability to more gun deaths. Which should be obvious, Mr. Meyers continued. Thats like saying, where theres more white people, theres more brunch.But the Late Show exchange was strikingly civil. Mr. OReilly signaled openness to restrict some guns; Mr. Colbert gently shushed his less conservative audience when it grumbled at his guest: Listen to what he has to say, please.Trying to come to some mutual understanding about guns and terrorism at any time, let alone in an election year, seems quaint and quixotic. And it symbolizes the tough job Mr. Colbert has had in synthesizing the Comedy Central and CBS audiences on his new show. He might be too political for the car pool-karaoke crowd, too accommodating for partisans who want viral clips of their enemies being totally destroyed.Whether he succeeds or not, there was a growing, exhausted sense Monday that the usual emote-and-move-on approach wasnt cutting it. As Mr. OBrien put it: Its time to grow up."}
{"text": "In 1993, Stephen Shore traveled to Luzzara, a rural district in Northern Italy, to photograph its residents. The resulting portfolio paints a picture of a traditional community slowly embracing modernity. In one image, a young woman holds a child whose disposable diaper is visible behind the edge of his bodysuit. In another, a woman smokes a cigarette astride an old bicycle, protected from the weather in a zippered plastic rain jacket. These portraits are juxtaposed with images of ornate wrought-iron work, immaculately tended fields and crumbling plaster walls.Forty years earlier, Luzzara had been the subject of a celebrated study by the American photographer Paul Strand, who evocatively captured postwar life there for the influential book Un Paese. In the early 1990s, the Reggio Emilia region launched a project called Linea di Confine (Boundary Lines) and commissioned leading photographers to document the area and its inhabitants. It was for this project that Shore came to Luzzara. It was simply a coincidence that it happened to be 40 years after Strand was there, Shore tells T. But they thought that since this was the case, they should invite an American photographer who used a large-format camera. So thats how I wound up there.Traveling to Luzzara, Shore  who had had his first retrospective at MoMA in 1971  said he had no expectation. He adds: I had never been to the city before, never been to anywhere in Reggio Emilia. I wasnt interested in doing to Luzzara what I did in the U.S. 20 years previously  I had moved on. He knew Strand and his work and owned a copy of Un Paese, but felt no need to pay direct homage to the older artist. Strands work tended to be limited by his political outlook: He was looking for an idealized agrarian village, explains Shore. While he photographed Luzzara in 1953, there wasnt anything in his pictures that couldnt have been made in 1913, 40 years earlier: There were no telephone lines, there were no cars. His view was, to my mind, highly idealized, and I wanted to reveal Luzzara as it was.What Shore found was a town in which a peeling 16th-century farm building could house an office equipped with state-of-the-art Macintosh computers. The people there to my mind integrated beautifully and enjoyed that integration, he recalls. I couldnt help but think that they relished the contrast.This month the photographic imprint Stanley/Barker will publish Shores Stephen Shore: Luzzara as a stand-alone book, including a number of images that have remained unseen for over 20 years.

{"text": "Homegoing, the wildly ambitious debut novel by a 26-year-old writer named Yaa Gyasi, tackles some 250 years of history on two continents. Its a novel that seems to have been inspired by such disparate family sagas as Gabriel Garca Mrquezs One Hundred Years of Solitude, Alex Haleys Roots and Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks, a novel that sets itself the daunting task of tracing the legacy of sorrow that slavery has left on eight generations of one family.Its impossible not to admire the ambition and scope of Homegoing, and thanks to Ms. Gyasis instinctive storytelling gifts, the book leaves the reader with a visceral understanding of both the savage realities of slavery and the emotional damage that is handed down, over the centuries, from mothers to daughters, fathers to sons. At its best, the novel makes us experience the horrors of slavery on an intimate, personal level; by its conclusion, the characters tales of loss and resilience have acquired an inexorable and cumulative emotional weight.When someone does wrong, one character says, whether it is you or me, whether it is mother or father, whether it is the Gold Coast man or the white man, it is like a fisherman casting a net into the water. He keeps only one or two fish that he needs to feed himself and puts the rest in the water, thinking that their lives will go back to normal. No one forgets that they were once captive, even if they are now free.Ms. Gyasis workmanlike prose and brisk jump-cuts from one generations woes to anothers, however, mean that Homegoing never creates the sort of immersive, fully imagined fictional world that One Hundred Years of Solitude did  never makes the leap into the hyperspace of myth that Toni Morrisons Beloved achieved. As a result, Homegoing often feels deliberate and earthbound: The reader is aware, especially in the American chapters, that significant historical events and issues (like Reconstruction, the Great Migration and the mass incarceration of African-American men) have been shoehorned into the narrative, and that characters have been made to trudge through experiences (like chain gangs and heroin addiction) meant, in some way, to be representative.The novel features alternating chapters, set on the Gold Coast of Africa (which would later become Ghana, where Ms. Gyasi was born) and America (where she grew up and went to school). It traces the lives of two half sisters, named Effia and Esi, and their offspring.Effia the Beauty is married off to James Collins, a wealthy Englishman, who helps oversee operations at Cape Coast Castle, a fortress and British trade headquarters. Esi, the daughter of an Asante warrior, is captured and sold to the British; unbeknown to Effia, she winds up in the fetid dungeons of the Castle, before being shipped off to America as a slave. Esi survives her terrible travails by developing a hard heart; when her daughter, Ness, is taken from her and sold in 1796, Esi does not even cry or reach out to her:And though Ness had met warm slaves on other plantations, black people who smiled and hugged and told nice stories, she would always miss the gray rock of her mothers heart. She would always associate real love with a hardness of spirit.Ness and her husband, Sam, will risk their lives in a desperate bid for freedom; they will sacrifice so that their son, Kojo, might grow up a free man, though he will later wonder if he would ever truly know who his people were, and who their people were before them.These efforts to break free from the past are made by many of both Esi and Effias descendants. The impetus is usually love  love for a man or a woman that offers them the promise of a new life; or love for a child, who might enjoy the freedoms and opportunities they never had themselves. Family knowledge is passed down through stories, but later generations seem to have misplaced much of this oral tradition; one of Esis youngest descendants, Marcus  who is working for a doctorate in sociology at Stanford  must diligently piece together the past through research and study, and a trip to Ghana (not unlike one that Ms. Gyasi took at 20, after her sophomore year at Stanford).Ms. Gyasi, who earned a master of fine arts from the Iowa Writers Workshop, takes a similarly methodical approach to much of the historical material in this novel. Its when she focuses not on the wide-angle aspects of her story, but on relationships  between parents and children, wives and husbands  that her writing is at its most potent. At those moments, we feel we are not getting a history lesson, but hearing the stories of individual men and women we have come to know and understand."}
{"text": "Long before Omar Mateens victims had all been identified, the presumptive nominees for president of the United States were clashing on a seemingly narrow question: Was the massacre an act of radical Islam?Donald J. Trump and other Republicans have long used the phrase, partly as a way of suggesting that President Obama privileges political correctness over keeping Americans safe. Democrats have avoided it for fear of exacerbating Islamophobia and legitimizing terrorists claims to represent a religion. On Monday morning, Hillary Clinton broke with Mr. Obama, using the term herself to describe Mr. Mateen, the Florida security guard who perpetrated the mass shooting.This debate over terminology might seem like a distraction, but it also speaks to the hardest and most contentious question of all: When a troubled young man murders dozens of people, invoking a group with which he appears to have few real links, how do we classify, and thereby make sense of, what he did?Orlando, like previous attacks, has prompted an obsessive search for clues that might allow us to place this violence within a familiar context.Mr. Trump, by citing radical Islam, urges a narrative of clashing civilizations and war on terror. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, has focused his outrage on what he sees as the laxity of Americas gun laws. And gay rights groups have placed the attack within a long history of homophobic violence.The question of Mr. Mateens motivation has ramifications that go well beyond Orlando. Those who seek stricter gun control have an incentive to emphasize his history of domestic violence, threatening statements, emotional problems and contact with the F.B.I. Those who desire a stronger American response to Islamist terrorism are motivated to see evidence for his ties to the Islamic State, the extremists he cited in a 911 call as the attack was underway.And for gay rights advocates who yearn for recognition of the scope of their persecution, Mr. Mateens targeting of a gay club during gay pride month is paramount.But as more details of Mr. Mateens life emerge  including reports that he visited the nightclub, Pulse, and used a gay dating app  they have blurred rather than clarified these competing narratives. The question of why this attack happened, and the underlying question of what to do about it, have only become harder to answer.The discussion of these scattershot and contradictory clues to Mr. Mateens motivations has become a proxy for an argument over whose narrative is truest and most urgent.As social media networks and cable news shows in the United States inevitably split along partisan lines, already widened by the presidential campaign, these narratives are increasingly framed as exclusive rather than complementary.Efforts to divine a motivation speak to something deeper than politics: a desire to make sense of seemingly senseless violence. Offering an explanation  whether it is radical Islam or mental illness or homophobia or gun access  is also a way of trying to comfort ourselves by asserting false clarity over something that is ultimately unknowable: the chain of personal experiences and decisions that led this man to murder 49 people in Orlando.There is a strong impulse, particularly in America, to do something after a tragedy like this, said Will McCants, a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. If we know why the tragedy happened, well know what to do.In truth, Mr. McCants said, terrorist attacks have a confluence of causes, and because were dealing with the human mind and the interplay of complex social and political factors, its difficult to separate the crucial from the incidental.This uncertainty is particularly acute with the Islamic States strategy of inspiring so-called lone wolf attacks, through propaganda that encourages supporters around the world to act on their own.This decentralization has given the group a seemingly global reach, but put decision making in the hands of individuals who identify with it for their own reasons and with their own agendas. It has blurred the distinction between the motivation of the group and of the individual, between violence that is strategic or that is senseless, between terrorist attacks rooted in ideology and other mass shootings reflecting more personal grievances.The motives of lone wolves are tough to pin down, Mr. McCants said. By definition, theyre not part of an organization, so their motives for attacking are bound to be more idiosyncratic.The holy grail of terrorism studies has, for years, been to identify a standard model or road map for why individuals attack. But repeated scholarly attempts have all failed. It is a deeply personal decision that people make for reasons that are almost entirely individual, and which may or may not even be political.How individuals get to this point is really complex, and if we try to boil it down to one factor were going to miss a lot of that complexity, said Paul Gill, a lecturer at University College London who studies terrorism. And its in that complexity that were going to really understand what happened.This reveals a difficult truth. External factors such as ideology and access to guns, though important, cannot fully explain why someone decides to lash out. Even if every detail of Mr. Mateens life were ultimately revealed, it would still not fully answer that most crucial question.By shoehorning these attacks into familiar narratives  gun violence, homophobia, jihadism  we can make sense of them, helping us to grieve, and also to process the danger and how to respond to it. Even more, it allows us to validate a pre-existing worldview or belief whose truth we feel has gone unacknowledged.But because no single narrative is ever sufficient, the debate is always unsettled  and always raging.Its not just Americans who are grappling with this.In Western Europe, terrorism has become interlocked in debates over immigration and cultural inclusivity  how traditionally secular societies can or should tolerate growing Muslim minorities.As in the United States, these debates hinge on questions of individual motive that are impossible to pin down: Are terrorists motivated by religion? By economic marginalization?We want to live in a world where these questions have identifiable answers, and politicians are happy to tell us that they do, so that they can present themselves as the solution.Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. I dont want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!The radical Islam narrative, of all those available, offers perhaps the clearest appeal. It portrays attackers and potential attackers as a monolith, identifiable by common features that are alien to Americas non-Muslim majority. And it frames terrorism within the familiar context of a war  something that can be won.Mr. Obamas emphasis on access to deadly weapons, however, presents terrorism as an extension of crime and therefore something that can only be managed. Still, this approach offers its own villains  politicians and lobbyists who oppose tighter gun regulations  as well as a simple way for thinking about the threat and how to curtail it.What these narratives all tend to play down or deny is the degree to which terrorism is driven by individual people making individual decisions.Political leaders do not want to admit this, as it requires conceding that violence is never fully preventable. Nor can the Islamic State acknowledge that its soldiers might sometimes be little more than disturbed individuals grasping for justification. And victims  who could be said to include all citizens of any country targeted by an attack  do not want their trauma to be robbed of meaning.That may be what is so disturbing about the ultimate unknowability of Mr. Mateens motivations: not just that there will inevitably be another attack on another soft target in another unsuspecting city, but also that its cause can and will be guessed at, but never really understood."}
{"text": "When the unemployment rate falls below 5 percent, it usually means things are going pretty well. It was 4.7 percent in May, a level last seen in November 2007.A different measure of the economys health, however, is beeping and flashing red. It says that labor market conditions have deteriorated with each passing month this year. In May, it fell to its lowest level in seven years.Called the Labor Market Conditions Index, it has been billed as a more complete measurement than that old war horse, the unemployment rate. There are two possible explanations for the indexs decline: one somewhat comforting, and the other scary.Lets do comfort first. Its possible were not making progress because weve more or less arrived at our destination  what economists call full employment. This somewhat misleading term doesnt mean that everyone has a job. It means that the reservoir of people seeking work has receded to a historically normal level.There is some evidence for this. Notably, the low unemployment rate.But there are also some pretty strong reasons for skepticism. My personal favorite: In 2007, about 88 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 were working. Now, roughly 85 percent of such men are working.Thats a difference of about two million men, most of whom probably would like jobs.The scary explanation? Job growth is slowing because the economy is losing steam.Fed officials, and other economists, have been grappling with the divergence between relatively weak reported economic growth and relatively strong job growth. Those at the Fed have largely taken the view that labor market data is more accurate, which has been true over time.But this time, some economists say, the broader economic data may be closer to the truth. Of course, the bond market understands this perfectly clearly, Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, noted recently. Investors have continued to discount the Feds hints that it plans to raise rates this summer, and again later this year. They are betting the Fed will once again be forced to wait longer than it wishes.(It has not escaped the notice of these pessimists that the Feds labor market index started showing weakness after the Fed increased rates in December.)The truth may be somewhere in between.The Federal Reserve introduced the new measure of labor market health a few months after Janet Yellen became the Feds chairwoman in 2014. It created the index because the unemployment rate is too simple. Even the name is too simple. It doesnt actually measure unemployment; it counts only people who are actively looking for work. Moreover, a low unemployment rate doesnt tell you how many part-time workers would like full-time gigs. It doesnt tell you how many full-time workers would like a better job at higher pay.In short, particularly in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has improved much more quickly than the actual labor market.The Feds corrective, however, is also imperfect. The central bank mashed together 19 kinds of labor data, including high-profile stalwarts like the unemployment rate and less familiar esoterica like the Conference Boards help-wanted advertising index. And it tried to clean that data, scrubbing away the noise to reveal the underlying trends. But there is no perfect method for telling the difference, and a recent Goldman Sachs analysis suggests the Fed scrubbed too hard.Daan Struyven and Zach Pandl, economists at Goldman, concluded that the Fed is scrubbing away some of the economys actual progress. But they caution that is only a partial explanation: Economic growth still appears to be slowing.This is not to say that the labor market is still firing on all cylinders, they wrote. The labor market is still making progress, but at a meaningfully slower pace.So there you have it.The economy isnt great. The economy isnt terrible. Were just chugging along, and apparently thats about as good as it gets."}
{"text": "LONDON  Wagners Tristan und Isolde is the kind of work that opera companies do to prove they can. Hugely demanding of resources, time and self-belief, it makes a statement. And the statement in the new production that opened last Thursday and runs until July 9 at the English National Opera here is that this much loved but beleaguered company, struggling to survive near-terminal misfortunes, can still show a brave face to the world.A thing of beauty and ambition qualified by clumsy farce, this Tristan is directed by the companys just-announced artistic director, Daniel Kramer (an emergency appointment after the show first went into rehearsal), and conducted by Edward Gardner, its former music director. (His successor lasted six months in the job, which is now vacant.)Star billing goes to the sculptor Anish Kapoor, who has designed the spectacular sets. It was smart to engage Mr. Kapoor: His fame will draw an audience beyond the usual opera crowd and fill the London Coliseums 2,400 seats. (Attendance is one of several problems the English National Opera has to fix.) But more than that, his monumental, magisterial abstraction is a perfect visual correlative to Wagners score.Tristan is bulky but not busy theater. There are rarely more than three or four people on the stage. The chorus plays a token role. The context scarcely matters. And the little action that occurs is contained within the final minutes of each act.For most of its four hours, Tristan is expansively contemplative: a meditation on the power of love. And Mr. Kapoors elementally grand images have a totemic beauty that invites reflective thought.Act I played in a golden, pyramidlike frame suggestive of the ceremonial formality with which Tristan is escorting a royal bride to meet her husband. Act II was set in a vast suspended hemisphere, hollowed out to look initially like the moon but then revealed as something closer to a geological specimen large enough for two lovers to clamber inside. And for Act III, the hemisphere was adapted into a sort of human organ  possibly a beating heart, or Tristans wound steeped in the purple-red of flowing blood.So far so good. But then came an aesthetic conflict. Set against Mr. Kapoors art-house purity were grotesquely fussy costumes by Christina Cunningham, somewhere between Star Wars and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Isolde (Heidi Melton) made her Act I entrance in a shapeless wrap that made her look like a malevolent hot-water bottle. Tristan (Stuart Skelton) was a toy-box Jedi. And with slapstick routines foisted on their attendants, Kurwenal and Brangne, much of this high-serious opera hovered on the edge of farce. It might well have been Godot rather than Isolde we were waiting for in Act III.Mr. Kramers reasons for such unexpected comedy seemed to be that love and life are alternating forms of madness, equally absurd, achieving sanity only in death. Whatever his intentions, they drew memorable performances from an outstanding cast. In supporting roles, Karen Cargill and Craig Colclough brought a manic brilliance to the two attendants that might be called pioneering. Matthew Roses King Marke was a paradigm of sorrowful nobility, magnificently sung.Ms. Melton and Mr. Skelton were credible and captivating as ardent lovers; if there was an awkwardness about their gestures of abandonment as they romped in Mr. Kapoors hemisphere, no matter. It was touching, poignant, heartfelt.Both had brightly agile voices with no glimmer of the rasping tightness that afflicts too many singers in this helden, or heroic repertory. And Mr. Skelton proved to be one of the freshest-sounding Tristans on the world stage  having sung it only once before, with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic this year. He takes it on again to open the 2016-17 season at the Metropolitan Opera, which should be something to look forward to.The biggest cheers, though, at the London Coliseum went to Mr. Gardner and the orchestra. They were the opening-night heroes  partly for artistic reasons (it was a magnificently measured reading, rich in texture, grand in scope), but also for holding firm while everything around them at the coliseum staggers from one crisis to the next.Throughout the companys woes  which can be attributed to financial recklessness, mismanagement, infighting and deep cuts in government funding  the orchestra and chorus have been in the firing line, with threats (partly realized) to pare them down into a smaller and less permanent ensemble.Disputes about the future of the chorus were what prompted the departure of Mark Wigglesworth, Mr. Gardners short-lived successor as musical director. And the companys management continues to seek ways to save money or make money, including trimming the number of new productions. Perhaps they have been thinking about Mr. Kapoors artful sets. They would most likely raise a useful sum at Sothebys."}
{"text": "PARIS  A police captain was fatally stabbed and his companion was also killed at their home in a small town northwest of Paris on Monday evening, and within hours the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murders.The police captain, who was not otherwise identified, was outside his home in Magnanville when he was stabbed by an unidentified assailant, who appeared to have then entered the house and took the captains companion and 3-year-old son hostage, according to a statement on the website of the French Interior Ministry and a statement from President Franois Hollande.Members of an elite French police unit arrived and raided the home. They fatally shot the attacker, found the woman dead and rescued the boy. The statement added that the woman was an employee of the Interior Ministry.A statement issued in Arabic by the Amaq News Agency, which is linked to the Islamic State, said: Islamic State fighter kills deputy chief of the police station in the city of Les Mureaux and his wife with blade weapons, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites.It is the second attack during Ramadan this year that has been tied to the Islamic State. The first was the shooting on Sunday in Orlando, Fla., in which 49 died, making it the worst mass shooting in American history. Before he was killed by the police, the gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State.Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims dedicated to fasting and prayer, has historically been a time when both Al Qaeda and now the Islamic State have escalated attacks. In his annual pre-Ramadan speech, an Islamic State spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani  who had not issued a statement in approximately seven months  re-emerged to call on the groups followers to carry out assaults in Europe and America.The smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us, Mr. Adnani declared in the audio speech, which was uploaded to Telegram and Twitter on May 21.Mr. Hollande called the attack a cowardly murder in a statement issued late Monday, saying he would be briefed on the case early Tuesday and that the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, would travel on Tuesday morning to the area where the killings took place.Magnanville is about 35 miles from central Paris.With the Euro 2016 soccer tournament underway in France and multiple warnings of the possibility of terrorist attacks during the monthlong event, the authorities have been on alert for possible attacks. Extraordinary measures have been put in place to ensure that the crowds of visitors at the soccer matches will be safe.Much of the public focus has been on avoiding a repeat of the sort of attacks that killed 130 people in and near Paris on Nov. 13. In that case, a network of former Islamic State fighters from Belgium and France staged the attacks along with a few people who expressed loyalty to the extremist group but had not traveled abroad to fight.However, perhaps the risk that is harder to protect against are the lone-wolf attacks encouraged by the Islamic State. Such would-be jihadists are harder for the authorities to detect.A similar case arose in June 2015 when an employee at a small trucking company beheaded his boss and attempted to set off an explosion at an American-owned chemical and gas factory near Lyon. The man, Yassine Salhi, appears to have had a friend who had gone to Syria to join the Islamic State, and Mr. Salhi sent him pictures of the beheading.Mr. Salhi killed himself in prison in December while awaiting trial.The beheading, like the stabbing on Monday evening, took place during Ramadan."}
{"text": "LONDON  With nine days left before Britain votes on whether to remain in the European Union, the possibility of Turkeys becoming a member of the bloc has inflamed the debate, injecting divisive issues of race, religion and tolerance openly into the campaign.Supporters of a British exit from the European Union say allowing Turkey in would leave Britain exposed to a new wave of Muslim immigration and more vulnerable to Islamic radicals. While Turkey has been pushing for membership, it faces considerable hurdles, and its entry, if it ever happens, would be many years, if not decades, away.The debate over the vote, which has split Prime Minister David Camerons Conservative Party, has largely played out around fear so far. Those in favor of remaining in the bloc, including Mr. Cameron, have emphasized the economic risks of a vote to leave.Those in favor of leaving, including other leading Conservatives, have stressed the social, cultural and economic risks of continued immigration from other European Union countries, whose citizens are entitled to live and work in Britain. Most of the recent European immigrants to Britain have come from Poland, the Baltics, Spain and Greece.The emphasis on the supposedly imminent membership of Turkey, however, adds a new and darker aspect to the arguments for Britains leaving: Turkey would be the blocs second-largest country after Germany, and it is poor, is Muslim and borders Syria, where young British Muslims radicalized by the Islamic State travel to enter the netherworld of terrorism.The debate is happening when attacks like the one in Orlando, Fla., have raised concerns about both Islamic radicalism and Islamophobia. An unofficial group advocating Britains departure from the European Union posted a controversial message on Twitter on Monday, warning of Islamist extremism and urging an exit from the bloc before we see an Orlando-style atrocity here before too long. After immediate criticism, the message was deleted.In the Vote Leave campaigns official leaflet, which will go to some 40 million Britons, Turkish accession is a prominent theme, and a map shows how Turkish membership would mean a European Union border with Syria and Iraq. Vote Leave has also asserted that Turkey has higher levels of criminality, gun ownership and gangsterism.Since the birthrate in Turkey is so high, we can expect to see an additional million people added to the U.K. population from Turkey alone within eight years, Vote Leave said.Trevor Phillips, a former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in Britain, said that there really isnt any doubt that what they are appealing to here is straightforward prejudice.The opposition Labour Partys shadow justice secretary, Charles Falconer, said the claims are dangerous and inflame racism.None of this needs decoding, Philip Stephens, a columnist for The Financial Times, wrote, arguing that the implicit calls to racism have become explicit. The dog whistle has made way for the klaxon. E.U. membership talks with Turkey, we are to understand, will soon see Britain overrun by millions of (Muslim) Turks  most of them thugs or welfare-scroungers.Tim Farron, the leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, said that coded nudges and winks like this are utterly horrific. He added, Vote Leave is just playing the politics of division, and it has no place in British society.Yvette Cooper, a Labour member of Parliament and former shadow foreign secretary, accused the leaders of the Vote Leave camp, Justice Secretary Michael Gove and the Conservative former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, of lying to voters and putting social cohesion at risk with their exaggerated warnings about immigration from Turkey and assertions that Turkey could be a full European Union member by 2020.Ms. Cooper said the discussion was utterly shameful, since both men know that Turkey is many years away from joining the European Union. Any member nation also could veto the countrys entry, including historical enemies like Cyprus and Greece.They are deliberately manipulating the facts; they are deliberately telling lies, she said. It is shameful, utterly shameful.In the past, Mr. Cameron, who is the leader of the Remain campaign, has said it is government policy to support Turkish membership in the bloc when the country qualifies, a position that Mr. Johnson himself, whose great-grandfather was Turkish, also embraced enthusiastically at one point.Now, Mr. Stephens wrote, Mr. Johnson lets the Islamophobia hang in the air.Mr. Cameron and his deputy, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, have pointed out that Turkeys membership is unlikely to happen and would be decades away even if Cyprus and Greece went along. The authoritarian shift of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is driving away even Turkeys previous allies in Europe.I dont think its going to happen in my lifetime, said Mr. Osborne, who has just turned 45. Is it going to be a member of the European Union? No, its not.Asked about Mr. Camerons past support for Turkish membership, Mr. Osborne said: Turkey has gone backwards. There are concerns about democracy and human rights there. British government policy is that it should not join the European Union today.Further, the government points out, Britain is not part of the Schengen area of visa-free travel. So even if the Turks won some form of visa-free travel for Schengen countries, which Mr. Erdogan is seeking in return for helping Europe control the flow of Syrian refugees, such a deal would not affect Britain.In response, the Leave campaign denied charges of racism and said: The government must now urgently clarify whether its policy on Turkey has changed. Is it now promising to veto Turkish membership?On Sunday, the visa issue surfaced again with some leaked British diplomatic cables in The Sunday Times of London discussing the debate over whether to grant Turkey European Union visa liberalization in return for its efforts to house and control Syrian refugees.One cable from a British diplomat in Ankara, Turkeys capital, discussed whether Britain might itself grant visa-free status to 1.5 million Turkish special passport holders, who are mostly civil servants, as a significant and symbolic gesture to Turkey, in part to keep Mr. Erdogan from carrying out his threat to open the floodgates to Europe for migrants.The government responded by calling the article selectively leaked quotes that are designed to give a completely false impression that the U.K. is considering granting visa liberalization to some Turkish citizens.Both Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne have suggested that the Leave campaign has devolved from a more high-minded discussion of Britains role in the world and its sovereignty to the anti-immigration theme that has been the calling card of the U.K. Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage.Mr. Osborne called Mr. Farages vision of Britain mean and divisive.Mr. Farage, in a television debate last week, said British women could be at risk of sexual assaults from immigrants if Britain voted to remain in the European Union. Referring to reports of sexual assaults by migrants on German women in Cologne on New Years Eve in 2015, Mr. Farage called this the nuclear bomb of the referendum campaign.Mr. Gove said the European Union should be protesting Turkeys erosion of democratic freedoms instead of granting it concessions.The referendum on June 23, Mr. Gove said, is the only chance for Britons to have their say on the free movement of Turks.With the terrorism threat we face only growing, it is hard to see how it could possibly be in our security interests to open visa-free travel to 77 million Turkish citizens and to create a border-free zone from Iraq, Iran and Syria to the English Channel, he said.Mr. Johnson, who was attacked by the former Conservative prime minister John Major for a squalid and deceitful campaign, including depressing and awful arguments on immigration and Turkey, responded, Frankly, I dont mind whether Turkey joins the E.U., provided that the U.K. leaves the E.U.Asked about his previous support for Turkish membership, Mr. Johnson said both Turkey and the European Union had changed. That was back in the days when some of us thought that widening the E.U. would not mean this federalizing, centralizing, deepening process that we have seen, he said."}
{"text": "Dear Diary:While I know I shouldnt, I love thinking back to the first kiss of each evening that weve spent in tandem. Im clearly the more invested one in this degenerate pair of 25-year-olds  both of us sucking down this city like the second-to-last margarita of happy hour.The first one: a quintessential, sloppy affair in the back of a yellow cab speeding down Avenue A.The second: a dark corner of Bowery Ballroom after one of those whispering-in-each-others-ears conversations that one must resort to at a loud show.Next, with our legs dangling off the edge of the Ping-Pong table at Rough Trade, the band playing beneath our feet.Then, sitting on that lone leather couch at the Edge. Dancing to Hall & Oates on my rooftop. Pushed up against a closed storefront somewhere between Brooklyn Bowl and your place. An L train, a D train, the balcony at the Music Hall of Williamsburg.A drunk and musical dalliance, to be sure. Each night and first kiss we share I assume is the last one of its kind. But there always seems to be another show, another conversation composed of whispers, and, inevitably, one more meaningless, memorable first kiss with you."}
{"text": "The Board of Regents, New York States highest education authority, voted on Monday to make it easier for some students with disabilities to graduate from high school.Under a new regulation, students with individualized education plans would need to pass two Regents exams  English and math  rather than five. They would still have to take three other exams, in social studies, science and one optional subject, but if they did not pass, their district superintendent could still grant them a diploma if they demonstrated proficiency in those subjects through coursework. The students would not receive the more-rigorous Regents diplomas, but would receive local diplomas, which are accepted by colleges, the military and employers. These students would have to achieve scores of 55 or higher on the English and math exams, or successfully appeal scores of 52 to 54.Schools start administering Regents exams on Tuesday, and the regulation will take effect immediately. The chancellor of the Board of Regents, Betty A. Rosa, said in an interview that the State Education Department estimated the change would help 1,300 to 2,000 students graduate this year.Ms. Rosa, who was elected chancellor in March, has criticized what she has called an overemphasis on standardized tests in evaluating both students and teachers. She said on Monday that the Regents were going to take a broad look at the states graduation requirements. Asked if they might decide to let students without disabilities show proficiency through coursework, she said it was too early to say.The Regents also voted on Monday to allow school districts to apply for a waiver to a requirement in the states teacher evaluation law that teachers and principals be observed by independent evaluators as well as their direct supervisors. The requirement could be waived if the districts can show that compliance would cause financial hardship, among other conditions."}
{"text": "The ancient Greeks had different words for different kinds of love  like Ludus (playful love), Pragma (longstanding love) and Agape (universal love). Sixteen hundred years ago, Augustine argued that the essence of a good life is choosing the right things to love and loving them well.But over the past several centuries our models of human behavior have amputated love. Hobbes and other philosophers argued that society is a machine driven by selfishness. Enlightenment philosophers emphasized reason over emotion. Contemporary social science was built on the idea that were self-interested, calculating creatures.This philosophical shift has caused unimaginable harm, especially in the sphere of education.Education is one of those spheres where the heart is inseparable from the head. If students are going to succeed, they probably need to come from a home where they feel safe and secure, so they arent paralyzed by anxiety and fear. They probably need to have experienced strong attachments so they know how to bond with teachers and parents. They probably need to have been bathed in love so they have some sense of identity, some confidence about their own worth and some sense of agency about their own future.Even within the classroom, the key fact is the love between a teacher and a student: the teachers willingness to pour time, attention and care into the student; the students desire to be worthy of that care and win affection and approval.For years, schools didnt have to think about love because there were so many other nurturing social institutions. But recently the family has frazzled and community has frayed. Today many students come to school lacking a secure emotional base.Basically whats happened over the past generation is that weve put enormous effort into improving the academic piece of schooling, but progress has been nil because the students emotional foundation has been collapsing under our feet. The schools are better than they were, but the gap between the rich and the poor is just as great as it was 20 years ago because the emotional environment is worse.The good news is that attention is finally turning to the love lives of our students  to the psychic and emotional qualities they bring to the classroom. No one is better at chronicling this shift than Paul Tough, the author of How Children Succeed and now Helping Children Succeed. In his latest book, he asks how, concretely, can we improve students noncognitive skills. (Noncognitive skills is a euphemism social scientists use for those things students get from love and attachment.)Tough notices that many of the teachers who improve their students character never actually talk about character. They coach them in chess, or enthuse over science. Tough concludes that skills like resilience and self-control are not really skills the way reading is a skill, they are traits imparted by an environment.The most important educational environment is the one that surrounds a child in the first five years, when the emotional foundations are being engraved. The gap between rich and poor students opens up before age 5 and stays pretty constant through high school. Despite this, the U.S. ranks 31st out of 32 developed nations in the amount it spends on early childhood.Better policy can help. Some of the best programs help parents do what they are already doing but more consistently  to have serve and return interactions with their kids; to practice distanced empathy  to hear their children when they are upset, and to guide them back toward calmness.Tough reports on research by Roland Fryer at Harvard showing that attempts to pay kids to read more and perform better have been largely ineffective. Students are not motivated by financial incentives. He also reports on research by C. Kirabo Jackson at Northwestern, which shows that while some teachers are good at raising their students test scores, other teachers are really good at improving their students school engagement. Teachers in the first group are amply rewarded these days, but teachers who motivate their students to show up every day and throw themselves into school life may not even realize how good they are, because emotional engagement is not something we measure and stress.Teachers are now called upon not only to teach biology but to create a culture: a culture of caring criticism, so students feel loved while they improve; a culture of belonging, so fragile students feel their work has value. Suddenly, teachers must teach students how to feel about their own feelings; how not to be swallowed up by moments of failure, anger and sadness, but to slow the moment and step outside the emotional spiral.Many teachers sense that students are more emotionally vulnerable today. Social policy has to find a hundred ways to nurture loving relationships. Today we have to fortify the heart if were going to educate the mind."}
{"text": "OAKLAND, Calif.  The key to a series-saving victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals could be reasonably traced to Game 4, three days and three time zones removed. That was when and where LeBron James tangled with Draymond Green, which eventually led to a flagrant foul on Green that kept him out of Game 5 with a suspension.And without Green around to verbally harass and defensively challenge James, the Golden State Warriors lost their spunk as James scored 41 points and pulled down 16 rebounds to lead the Cavaliers to a 112-97 victory Monday night.Kyrie Irving added 41 points of his own, creating a two-man attack that the cold-shooting Warriors could not contain and could not match. James and Irving became the first teammates to score 40 or more points in a finals game.We just wanted them to attack, to be aggressive like weve been talking about all, Cleveland Coach Tyronn Lue said. And they had two great games, two breakout games.James, accustomed to carrying teams in big games, handed the credit to Irving.Its probably one of the greatest performances Ive ever seen, live, James said.The Cavaliers, who trail the best-of-seven series by 3 games to 2, kept the Warriors from clinching their second-straight N.B.A. title and dragged the series back to Cleveland for Game 6 on Thursday.Now, mind you, to repeat a performance like this would definitely be tough, but whatever it takes to win, Irving said, adding: Were not satisfied. We understand the magnitude of what Game 6 means to us at home.Playing a physical game filled with hard fouls, sprawling bodies and constant arguments with officials, the Cavaliers turned a halftime tie into a blowout victory. They slowly deflated a crowd expecting a coronation for a team that won a record 73 regular-season games and beat the Cavaliers in Games 1 and 2 by a combined 48 points, the largest differential for the first two games in finals history.Golden State Coach Steve Kerr had foreshadowed the possibility before the game.What weve learned the last couple of years is that were a team that sometimes lets down when things are going well, he said. But were also a team that has responded every single time weve been faced with adversity in the playoffs the last two years.The Warriors were led by Klay Thompsons 37 points, and his Splash Brother, Stephen Curry, added 25. But they got uneven contributions from teammates, and the Warriors shot just 36.4 percent from the field. The best 3-point shooting team in history shot just 3 of 21 from behind the 3-point line in the second half.The Warriors were glum afterward, knowing that one opportunity had slipped, but tried to see the bigger picture in the series.I like our chances going forward, Curry said.The Cavaliers rekindled hope that they could bring a long-awaited championship to a title-starved city. The Cavaliers have not won an N.B.A. title in their 46-season history, and Cleveland has not won a major league sports championship since the Browns won the N.F.L. title in 1964.If they should end that curse, however, the Cavaliers would have to win twice more, including a Game 7 back at Oracle Arena on Sunday.The Warriors, whose 50 home victories in the regular season and the playoffs tied an N.B.A. record, now look to repeat their winning methods of last year, when they clinched the championship in a Game 6 victory in Cleveland.They will do it, presumably, with Green in the lineup. On Monday, he was not allowed inside Oracle Arena and watched the game next door at Oakland Coliseum, where the As played a baseball game. His hope was to sprint into the arena after the final buzzer to take part in a championship celebration that did not happen.Lue, Clevelands coach, called Green Golden States best defender, and Kerr said the absence  which he has not publicly criticized  was a factor.We werent very good defensively, Kerr said. We obviously knew we were without Draymond, so theres no point in harping on that. We had to play better, and we didnt.The league suspension stemmed from an altercation with James last Friday night in Cleveland. The two beefy forwards got tangled and Green tumbled to the court. When James emphatically stepped over him, Green took a swipe at James. The two discussed their differences animatedly as play continued around them.On Sunday, the N.B.A. described Greens actions as a retaliatory swipe of his hand to the groin of James and, two days after the game, issued him a flagrant foul, his third of the postseason. It led to an automatic one-game suspension.For Game 5, the Warriors owner Joe Lacob was among the fans wearing a Green jersey. Some held oversize cardboard cutouts of Greens face. A Free Draymond chant percolated through the crowd now and again. James was booed whenever he had the ball, which was often, and sometimes sustained the boos long after he gave it up.Andre Iguodala, the most valuable player of last years finals, started in Greens place and scored the games first basket on a break after stealing the ball from James. By the time the first quarter ended, he had 8 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals, the kind of score-sheet smorgasbord Green often supplies. Iguodala finished with 15 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists.The Warriors had a 32-29 lead after the first quarter, but with James resting, the Cavaliers began the second quarter with a 7-0 run. Intensity grew and the game turned more physical, testing the officials as bodies banged and sprawled in desperation. Thompson unknotted the scrums with a barrage of 3-pointers. The lead changed several times, and by the time the half ended on a last-second miss by James, it was tied, 61-61.Without Green, Kerr jostled his substitution patterns, further limited by first-half foul trouble and a third-quarter left knee injury to center Andrew Bogut, who was helped off the court and played less than eight minutes. He was scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging test on Monday night.A small lineup has been Golden States not-so-secret weapon at times in the playoffs, but the Cavaliers exploited it with force. James often drove hard to the basket, and forward Tristan Thompson hauled in 15 rebounds against his shorter opponents.By games end, James and Irving were on the bench, their season extended. The seats at Oracle Arena were emptying quickly, and there was no sign of Green running over for a celebration."}
{"text": "A 22-year-old Dutch woman detained for three months in Qatar on suspicion of adultery after she reported being drugged and raped was given a one-year suspended sentence on Monday and will be allowed to return home, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said.The woman, identified only as Laura and described as being from the Dutch city of Utrecht, was held and prosecuted on charges of adultery and alcohol consumption. She has been fined about 750 euros, or nearly $850, and will be sent back to the Netherlands, said Daphne Kerremans, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry.The ambassador is with her now and is making sure that she can go home as soon as possible, Ms. Kerremans said. It was quite overwhelming for her.Doha News, an internet news site in Qatar, reported that the ambassador to the Netherlands, Yvette Burghgraef van Eechoud, said outside the courtroom that the woman would be released from prison in coming days.News reports said that the man Laura accused of sexually assaulting her had also been detained and that he had told the Qatari authorities that the sex was consensual.The man, a Syrian citizen identified by Doha News in court papers as Omar Abdullah al-Hassan, was sentenced to 140 lashes for illegal sex acts and public drunkenness.The womans lawyer, Brian Lokollo, told the Dutch news media that she had gone in March to a hotel in Doha where alcohol is permitted.She felt unwell soon after taking the first sip of a drink and realized that something was wrong, he said. The next morning, she awoke in an unfamiliar apartment and realized that she had been raped.After reporting the attack to the authorities in Qatar, Mr. Lokollo said, she was detained, according to The Associated Press.The case captured global attention over the weekend after the womans family spoke in the Dutch news media about her arrest, and reports of the accusations and imprisonment she faced drew a campaign on social media calling for her release.The decision by soccer organizers to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar brought increased scrutiny to the human rights record of the tiny, oil-rich nation, and the rape case added to those concerns.Among the concerns of rights groups are the treatment of women and the labor conditions of migrant workers helping to build the infrastructure for the games.The Dutch Embassy in Qatar said it had been helping the woman from the moment it learned of her arrest.We have provided assistance to her since the first day of detention, it said in a statement issued before the verdict. For the sake of the defendants case, we will not make further comments at this point.Although alcohol consumption is largely illegal in Qatar, a conservative Muslim country, it is legally available at some upmarket hotels. Adultery is also illegal.In 2013, a Norwegian woman who was working in the United Arab Emirates received a 16-month prison sentence for illegal consumption of alcohol, unlawful sex and perjury after reporting to the police that she had been sexually assaulted by a colleague. She was eventually pardoned and allowed to leave the country to return home."}
{"text": "ORLANDO, Fla.  One of the survivors of Sundays attack at the nightclub Pulse, a man closeted from his family, called his Latin American parents abroad to tell them that a close friend  who was actually his partner  had died in the bar. Their response: You werent in that bar, were you?That attitude, a throwback to an earlier era, seemed the rare exception as relatives of those gunned down in the club, many of them Puerto Rican, mourned their deaths and celebrated their lives on the streets of Orlando.The moments of mourning seemed to show how far gay culture has progressed from a time when it was frequently hidden from loved ones.And so Eddie Justice, a 30-year-old gay accountant, texted his mother, Mina, Mommy, I love you, as bullets flew and the gunman, Omar Mateen, headed toward the Pulse bathroom where he was hiding, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Justice was confirmed dead on Monday.In the hours since the attack, there have been countless homages on social media posted by friends and relatives, who extolled the accomplishments of their loved ones and embraced their sexual identity.And there were the families of the anguished victims, who gathered around tables and in conference rooms to await word about whether their sons, daughters, cousins or uncles  gay or straight  had died.It is a seismic shift from the atmosphere four decades ago after the firebombing of the UpStairs lounge in New Orleans. Back in 1973, some relatives refused to claim the bodies of their gay sons, banishing them to potters fields and the New Orleans community joked that the ashes of the dead would be buried in fruit jars. Thirty-two people died.It is not necessary to reach that far back to feel the progress, which has galloped swiftly ahead in the past 10 years. Despite setbacks and plenty of lingering hate, a new generation of gay people and lesbians feels far less weighed down by stigma and fear in todays rapidly evolving embrace of gay rights.A mother texting with her son and saying he was afraid and he was going to die, said Juan Cantu, a theatrical director of Mexican descent who lives here and was once a Disney World performer. That is a milestone. In my generation, Im 42, I kept it hidden and I didnt have the kind of relationship with my family that I would have told them that I was at a gay bar.But, he said, we are not there yet.It was Latin night at Pulse on Saturday, which meant that a large number of Latinos  gay and straight  came out to dance salsa and listen to music; most of them were Puerto Rican (a half a million live in the Orlando area) with a sprinkling of Mexicans and Colombians in the mix. While the club advertises as a gay bar and has a large gay clientele, it has always attracted a diverse group.Orlando has been one of the countrys most gay-friendly cities, with progressive anti-discrimination laws and aggressive advocates in Mayor Buddy Dyer and Patty Sheehan, an openly gay councilwoman. The city hosts gay days every year, huge gatherings that draw people from around the world. Also, local companies like Universal and Disney are gay-friendly. At least one shooting victim was a Disney performer.Among Latinos, acceptance of gay culture has moved ahead less assertively. An overlay of machista culture remains, making it more difficult to come out for fear of rejection and discrimination.Certainly there are pockets of cultural resistance  be it the Hispanic community or the black community, said Tim Vargas, the president of the board of GLBT Community Center of Central Florida, who is half Mexican. Both of those have had cultural hindrances to acceptance. I do think we have made a lot of progress.Luis Daniel Wilson-Leon, 37, who died at the club, was harassed for being gay as a young man growing up in Puerto Rico, a close friend, Daniel Gmys-Casiano, wrote on Facebook on Monday.Carlos Guillermo Smith, 35, an Orlando resident who is of Peruvian and French Canadian descent and is government affairs manager for Equality Florida, the statewide gay rights organization, called the massacre inside Pulse an attack on the Latino gay, lesbian and transgender community.When you look at the list of names of victims, 90 percent of them are young Latino men, said Mr. Smith, who is running as a Democrat for an Orlando seat in the State House. It is so devastating to our community because for me it is so personal, not only because this is my home, its my community, its against my identity as a gay Latino.As relatives waited on Sunday outside a hospital, they spoke lovingly of the young men and women who had been shot and killed, words that bespoke the transformation that has taken place.Barron Serrano said his brother Juan P. Rivera Velazquez, 37, who loved bodybuilding and karate, had been married to Luis Conde, 39, for 13 years, a partnership he said they had worked hard to nurture. Both were Puerto Rican.They had a bumpy relationship, at first; it was not easy and they had ups and down, but they always forgot about their problems and stuck together, Mr. Serrano said. They were a very happy couple.Al Ferguson, the owner of a travel agency that caters to gay people, said he had kept vigil with families at the hospital in support of his friend Edward Sotomayor Jr., a Puerto Rican man who died in the shooting.What struck me in the room is the vast majority of family and friends there were not gay, said Mr. Ferguson, who is gay. There were not lots of gay people supporting gay people. There were families that didnt care they were gay or didnt care they were in a gay club. They loved their son and their friend. That is a phenomenon that happened in the last six, seven, eight years: public acceptance of the gay community."}

{"text": "ORLANDO, Fla.  As the sound of gunfire in the nightclub grew louder, a patron named Orlando and a female friend took cover in a cramped bathroom stall, contorting their bodies on top of the toilet so their feet could not be seen. The gunman burst into the bathroom, went straight to the stall next to them and shot the people inside.People were screaming, begging for their lives, Orlando, 52, said in a telephone interview, asking that his last name not be used out of fear of retaliation from terrorist sympathizers.The gunman, Omar Mateen, was silent, then left the bathroom.He went out and started shooting outside again, Orlando said.For three sickening hours on Sunday morning, a life-or-death game of deception played out in a bathroom where the assailant holed up with hostages after killing dozens of people inside the Pulse nightclub. Orlando and his friend desperately tried to avoid becoming two more victims.Orlando said he listened as the gunman warned his hostages not to text anyone, took their cellphones, called 911 to calmly pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State, spoke about a need to stop American bombing in Syria and threatened greater bloodshed if the police moved in.Orlando described moments of surreal quiet as the siege went on and the killer fiddled with his weapon and used the sink and the hand dryer. Mr. Mateen checked on the bodies around him, Orlando said. At one point, Orlando switched positions and played dead, and he felt something poking him. He believed it was the gunman, checking to see if he was dead.Around 5 a.m., the police blew a hole in the wall, enabling some of the hostages to escape, and officers engaged in a fatal final confrontation with the assailant.Much of Orlandos account corresponds with new information released by the police on Monday, other witness accounts and video evidence, which combined to paint a chilling picture of the hostage crisis that unfolded after the attack.The first bursts of gunfire, around 2 a.m., were captured on video by 25-year-old Amanda Alvear, the footage uploaded to Snapchat.In the video, she is recording herself and others as they dance to the last song of the evening at the popular gay club. Then she turns the camera toward her own face. She is staring into the lens as the first few shots are heard. They do not seem to faze her. But as they continue, unrelenting, roughly 20 rounds, the video abruptly ends. She was listed among the dead on Monday.Just before the shooting began, 28-year-old Ashley Summers and her friends went to their bartender, Kate, at Pulses back bar to order one more round  a vodka, soda and lime for Ms. Summers; a vodka and Red Bull for one friend; and a specialty drink for the other.One of Ms. Summerss friends was polishing the credit card receipt with all sorts of pleasantries for the bartender  sexy kitten, muah, you the best  when the popping started. For 15 seconds, through the pulsing of the salsa music, they thought it might have been firecrackers, Ms. Summers said in an interview. But they eventually figured out it was gunshots. Ms. Summers said a friend pulled her to the ground. They felt glass shattering over their heads.They were near a back exit and crawled out. Concerned about what might be behind the seven-foot-high white privacy fence out back, they turned left, into a storage area. But they heard more gunshots coming from that direction, so they went back out onto the patio and used some furniture to vault over the fence. They dashed to safety.At that point it was shock, it was disbelief, it was fear, but it was urgency, said Ms. Summers, a ballroom dance instructor. There was knowing that we had to get out of there.Soon after Mr. Mateen first opened fire, he was confronted by an armed security guard who was an off-duty police officer, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief, at a news conference Monday morning. They exchanged gunfire. The security guard was then joined by an unknown number of police officers, the first to arrive on the scene.During these early rounds of gunfire, the police said, many patrons were able to escape. But the assailant retreated deeper into the club, eventually barricading himself in the bathroom, where some patrons had gone to hide.When the shots erupted, Norman Casiano dropped to his knees and crawled to what was apparently a different bathroom, seeking safety in a stall where many people were already crammed together. He tried to call 911, then his mother, shouting, Mom mom mom mom! into the phone before the call dropped.As Mr. Casiano, 25, and the others huddled together, a wounded man staggered into the bathroom and dropped to the floor. They urged him to try to stay quiet. At one point, as the gunman approached, Mr. Casiano said, he could hear shells clattering to the floor and the gun reloading. Then Mr. Mateen entered the bathroom.Just firing, firing, firing, Mr. Casiano said in an interview at his parents apartment, about two hours after he was released from the hospital on Monday afternoon.He was hit once in the back and felt a hot pulse of pain tear into him, as if his leg had been severed. He ended up being shot twice in the back, both bullets passing through his body, he said.Mr. Casiano said the gunman did not say anything, but laughed as people begged him not to shoot and assured him that they did not know who he was and had not seen his face.All I heard was a laugh, Mr. Casiano said. He laughed like an evil laugh, something thats just going to be imprinted in my head forever. It was, he said, a laugh of like, Ha, I did it.When the gunman left the bathroom, Mr. Casiano tried to urge others to leave, he said, and was able to slip away and escape. He said he was in a hospital bed by about 3 a.m., two hours before the siege ended.Orlandos escape took much longer. Hiding with his friend, he could hear the gunman drawing closer, the sound of each round getting louder.As he and his friend positioned themselves on the toilet, Orlando said, he also braced one foot against the stall door.Around this time, Mina Justice was asleep at home when she received a text from her 30-year-old son, Eddie Justice, she told reporters. He was also hiding in a bathroom at the club.Mommy I love you, the first message read. It came in at 2:06 a.m. In club they shooting.Only two minutes later, he wrote, Im gonna die.Another 30 minutes would pass before he sent a text begging for help.Call them mommy, he pleaded.Hurry, he wrote. Hes in the bathroom with us.Orlando said he never looked Mr. Mateen in the eye, but recalled his calm voice. At one point, after noticing that some of the hostages in the bathroom were texting, the gunman ordered them to surrender their phones.He spoke again, according to Orlando, asking the hostages, Are you guys black?He said, I dont have an issue with the blacks, Orlando said.Early in the siege, the gunman called 911 to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State, Chief Mina said.He was cool and calm when he was making those phone calls to us, he said.Orlando could hear the gunman speaking on the phone, presumably to the police. He spoke about how America should stop bombing the Islamic State.He got mad and hung up, Orlando said. He never heard Mr. Mateen mention gay people  he spoke only about the Islamic State and Syria, and about the damage he still intended to do.The gunman made several calls, and at one point, Orlando said, he told whoever was on the other line that there were people in the club with bombing vests as well as three snipers outside, ready to take out officers if they advanced on the club.Our negotiators were talking with him, and there were no shots at that time, Chief Mina said. But there was talk about bomb vests, about explosives, throughout, and there were statements made about imminent loss of life.Near the end of the siege, Mr. Mateen began to shoot the hostages in the bathroom, Orlando said.By some miracle, he said, he once again avoided detection, but a person in the neighboring stall was not so lucky. A man who had just been shot crawled under the stall, grasping at both Orlandos and his companions legs, pulling them down  and exposing their hiding spot. They played dead, my face against the toilet bowl, he said.In those moments, Orlandos phone would not stop ringing, as friends called to see if he was safe. He worried that the rings would draw attention and give him away.As the final battle with the police began, Orlando could hear the gunman loading his weapon, at one point shouting, Ive got plenty of bullets.Then there were explosions and chaos.The police had blown a hole in the bathroom wall, but Orlando said his muscles were so cramped he could barely move. My shoulders got caught, he said. A cop grabbed me and pulled me out through the hole.His female friend was also rescued. When he looked at his clothes, he was covered in blood, but it was not his own. He does not know if anyone else made it out of the bathroom alive.Mr. Justice, whose last text to his mother was just before 3 a.m., did not survive. His death was confirmed by the Orlando authorities early Monday morning."}

It didnt take long: The smartest fish was adept after only 30 trials.Then the researchers presented the fish with 44 color images of faces they had not seen.

{"text": "THEY MAY NOT MEAN TO, BUT THEY DOBy Cathleen Schine290 pp. Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26.I think Daddy died ... but Mommy doesnt want him to know. This comment by a distraught daughter at her fathers deathbed nicely sets the tone of Cathleen Schines latest novel, which combines black comedy with shrewd observation of family dynamics. Of a particular family, of course. The Bergmans inner circle consists of a father, Aaron; and a mother, Joy; their daughter, Molly; and son, Daniel  but it extends, significantly, to Mollys son, Ben; and Mollys lesbian partner, Freddie; as well as to Daniels wife, Coco; and his daughters, Ruby and Cora. To which Freddie adds her own parent and sibling problems. An extensive cast, then, one that allows for an extensive exploration of the fine balance between affection and exasperation that marks family relationships and, above all, the parent-child bond.At one point, in a wry inversion of the well-known Philip Larkin quotation (part of which Schine borrows for her title), Joy broods about her relationship with her son and daughter. At 86, she is devastated but not defeated by Aarons death. Yet her children are convinced she cant manage on her own. Molly wants her to leave New York and join her and Freddie in Los Angeles; Daniel visits dutifully, but worries about Joys finances. Joy still works  at a part-time job as a conservation consultant for a museum, a position she values, despite ageist attempts to sideline her. Joy is the central figure in the narrative, coping initially with a husband stricken with heart failure, colon cancer, bladder cancer and Alzheimers disease, a situation compounded by her own decline after a minor stroke and an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. We are not spared the distresses of age and infirmity.Widowed after a long marriage, Joy is a persuasive character, intelligent, independent, with a flair for witty responses and wry thoughts, though in fact everyone in Schines narrative is given to sharp comment and occasionally manic behavior. Despite its subject matter, They May Not Mean To, but They Do is a very funny novel.It is also a novel suffused with guilt. Joy dreads the prospect of having her children feel obliged to put her in a nursing home and feels guilty at her classic situation of being a burden. Molly is full of guilt because she lives in Los Angeles and cant visit her mother in New York as frequently as she might. Daniel feels guilty because he cant ask his mother to live with his wife and daughters. In other words, everyone is classically guilty about being a parent or a child. Emotionally confused but also entirely united, the Bergmans are a family bound together, as Freddie notes, with insular ferocity.This is a situation plenty of readers will recognize. There are particular ingredients here  this is a Jewish family, though theyre not especially observant Jews, and some fun is had with Ruby, Joys granddaughter, who suddenly decides she wants to keep kosher and go to the synagogue, to the confusion of her secularly inclined father. And there is of course the long shadow of past events  Aarons fecklessness with money, his frittering away of a family fortune, Daniels desperate illness at the age of 18. Schine reminds us that a family is as united by its trials as by its triumphs.I must confess, though, that I did get a touch irritated with Joy at a certain point, frustrated by her inability to do anything about an apartment apparently awash with papers, with files marked urgent, with unopened letters and so forth. Come on, Joy, its just a matter of gritting your teeth and getting down to it! And here I can speak with a certain authority, being myself an octogenarian. But I am my own sort of octogenarian, and that is the whole point. Old people do have certain collective features  mostly the age-related disabilities  but otherwise were as distinct from one another as are people of any age. Schine deserves credit for taking on the challenge of writing about an age of which she has no personal experience and, on the whole, making a convincing job of it. But novelists worth their salt must write beyond their experience most of the time  imagining different genders, ages, situations in time and space. Schines particular fictional exercise focuses on the way the members of a family cope with the challenges involved in disparities of age, of needs, of agendas. While Joy must make the best she can of her last years, her children have their own lives, their own problems. They are all bound to her by love and duty, they all mean well, but they are not always acting for the best.And then there is Karl, a friend of Aarons and an old flame of Joys. When she meets him on one of her walks in the park, hes propped on a red wheeled walker and accompanied by a Polish caregiver. But when it looks as if their friendly chats may lead to a deeper relationship, the rest of the family is horrified. After Joy invites Karl to the first family Passover since Aarons death and later proposes that he be invited to Rubys bat mitzvah, her children react by yelling and stamping their feet like toddlers.Cathleen Schine writes with economy and style  saying most by saying least, employing brief staccato sentences, with much of the action unfolding by way of dialogue. Some readers might feel that too much levity surrounds some disturbing matters  a farcical deathbed scene, the humiliations of colostomy bags and incontinence. But others will see this as a proper form of defiance, the best way to face down the most disagreeable of circumstances. This is a novel in which serious subjects are treated with a deliberately light touch, a tactic that doesnt imply insensitivity or lack of empathy but simply accepts the fact that humor may be the best way of dealing with the unavoidable.I have always mistrusted Tolstoys often quoted observation that happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. In fact, I doubt if the perfectly happy family exists, or at least one in which every member would claim to be absolutely content. Most families discontent has to do with relationships  with imbalances of affection, jealousies, resentments, changes in alignment. And it is very much this last that is the focus of the Bergman familys unhappiness, if it can be called that  the disconcerting shift of balance that comes about when old age strikes and suddenly (it always seems to be suddenly) those who were to be relied upon become those who are dependent. The parents become children. This troublesome shift is the focus of Schines deftly handled storytelling."}
{"text": "BOULDER, Colo.  Sitora Yusufiy thought she was done with her ex-husband, Omar Mateen.After a marriage in which she said he beat her, confiscated her paychecks and isolated her in their Florida home, Ms. Yusufiy said she fled in 2009 with the help of her parents. The last she remembers of Mr. Mateen is that he grabbed her arm to stop her from getting into the car and leaving him forever.He tried to reach in his back pocket, I dont know if he had a gun with him, but my mother felt that and she screamed out, Ms. Yusufiy said at an interview at the home where she lives with her fianc, here in the steep green hillsides above Boulder. That was the last time I saw him.Early Sunday morning, his presence ripped back into her life when Ms. Yusufiys mother called her to say that the man she had met through Myspace in 2008 and quickly married had committed the deadliest mass shooting in United States history.I had let that chapter of my life go a long time ago, she said. Its somebody that hurt me and traumatized me.She spent part of Sunday being interviewed by F.B.I. agents, who were inside the home for about an hour. Although officials said they had investigated Mr. Mateen in 2013 and 2014, Ms. Yusufiy said that Sunday was the first time she had been approached by law enforcement officials to talk about him.She answered phone calls from her mother and watched as her online photographs and social-media profiles were scattered across the internet. As she sat to speak of her memories of Mr. Mateen, she lightly touched a tree-of-life necklace her brother had given her and held a bracelet from her mother that she wears for protection.Ms. Yusufiy said she had immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2000, following her father, who had come a year earlier. She grew up in northern New Jersey and met Mr. Mateen around the time her parents started to talk to her about marrying.I had already started getting hints from my family  Oh, its time for you to get married, we want to set you up with somebody, she said. She said she figured if she was to marry young, she would do it on her own terms: I wanted to find somebody that I could relate to, and find him for myself.She said Mr. Mateen seemed nice at first. He joked around, had a decent job, aspired to become a police officer and respected his family, she said. He was an American but had roots in their shared culture, she said. After a few dates, she said their parents met to make formal marriage plans.I didnt have any knowledge or feeling of his instability, she said. My parents actually did not feel good about it. But I guess I was in a stage of really wanting to make my own decisions and be independent. So I decided to go on with it anyway, and go to Florida and marry him.After about six weeks, she said she began to notice erratic behavior and a temper that would flare, sometimes without warning or provocation. She said he became verbally and physically abusive. He forbade her to call her parents, and he allowed her only to go to her job as a day care teacher. He made her hand over her paycheck.He was totally two different people sometimes, and would turn and abuse me, out of nowhere, when I was sleeping, Ms. Yusufiy said.She said that Mr. Mateen was religious, but that he had never expressed sympathies for terrorist organizations or radical Islamists. But he did make anti-gay comments when he was angry, she said.There were definitely moments when hed express his intolerance toward homosexuals, she said.He kept a silver handgun in the house, and he went target shooting with friends. Ms. Yusufiy said that some of his friends were in law enforcement, and that he sometimes went shooting with them. He never threatened her with the gun, but its presence worried her.In 2009, Ms. Yusufiy said her parents began to sense the depth of the trouble and flew to Florida to intervene. After her parents extricated her from the marriage, they flew back to New Jersey.Im blessed to have the family that I do because they saved me from death, she said.Ms. Yusufiy said she had last heard from Mr. Mateen when he sent her a Facebook message about a year ago, casually trying to reconnect. She said she told him never to contact her again and blocked him."}

{"text": "You never know whats going to cause Donald J. Trump to officially ban a news organization from his presidential campaign events.For The Washington Post, it was a headline on Monday saying Donald Trump Suggests President Obama Was Involved With Orlando Shooting. Mr. Trump said Mr. Obamas refusal to say the words radical Islamic terrorism meant that, theres something going on. He did not say what Mr. Obamas secret agenda might be, leaving it to others to interpret. The Post later changed its headline to read that he  seems to connect Mr. Obama to the shootings. Too late  banned! (And, of course, SAD!)For the Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger, it was, apparently, a story about internal Trump dissension over his campaign managers quick temper and heavy-handed leadership that got his credentials revoked. For The Des Moines Register news team it was the editorial boards call for Mr. Trump to exit the race. Then there was BuzzFeed News, The Huffington Post, Univision, The Daily Beast and  so on.There is no obvious consistency to it, from a candidate who can also be as accessible as any in history. After all, The Wall Street Journals similar headline, that Mr. Trump Links Obama to Extremists, didnt cost that paper its official entree.Only Mr. Trump knows whether the bans are the result of pique or some carefully thought-out strategy (he denies the latter).But that doesnt matter.As of now, there is only this: The all-but-confirmed standard-bearer of one of the United Statess two major political parties is actively stripping credentials from news organizations that report things that he deems unfair or inaccurate. He has a black list and, unlike the one that Nixon kept, this is not a secret. Quite the opposite.I called and sent email to the Republican National Committee a couple of times on Tuesday, to see whether the party Mr. Trump will soon be nominated to lead would carry out the same bans, but I did not get a return call.I did get a call back from Mr. Trump, who said that he was exercising his right to choose whom he grants credentials to as he runs a campaign that he has mostly paid for himself. Im from a different world, other than politics, he said. In my world, when people dont treat you fairly   He didnt finish the sentence, but he didnt have to: You cut them off.I dont want good stories, he said, I want fair stories.To his mind, The Post had not been fair in its coverage of his speech, as evidenced by its decision to change its headline. But why, I asked him, was that the incident that led him to ban the paper. It was the last straw, he told me. At The Washington Post, he said, virtually every article is negative even when I have big victories.The New York Times was not much better, Mr. Trump said, citing a recent article about his relationship with women over the years. He rebutted the article after it was published and his lawyer demanded, unsuccessfully, that the paper retract it. When I noted that Mr. Trump had not removed The Timess credentials, Mr. Trump said, Youre marginal, youre marginal, apparently meaning we, too, were close to losing credentials to cover him. He added, Its always possible, anythings possible.I asked Mr. Trump what, exactly, will prompt a credential ban.If people dont cover me fairly, or if they actually make things up, I dont know why anybody should be allowed, he said.Fairness, and, increasingly, accuracy, is in the eye of the candidate and his or her supporters. That is worrisome, especially if Mr. Trump takes his strategy to the White House.But Mr. Trump said he would not impose similar credential bans if he won the presidency. Thats different from me taking something away  there Im taking something away where Im representing the nation, he said. As for The Post, he said, If they start covering me accurately, not even well, just accurately  I dont want anything  they will get the credentials back.Martin Baron, The Posts executive editor, said the newspaper was not going to change the way it covered Mr. Trump, which he described as fair, honest and honorable.I dont think we have to seek a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval from a presidential candidate  thats true during a campaign and thats true during a presidency, he said.There needs to be mutual respect between the media and the candidates, he said, and in this instance, clearly no respect toward our role is being shown. (Mr. Baron noted that The Post changed the headline of its own volition, to make it more accurately reflect Mr. Trumps remarks, which happens frequently across the media).Anybody who aspires to be president of the United States should exhibit behavior as a candidate that he or she would display as president of the United States, he said.The idea of a presidential campaign, after all, is to give the public a sense of how a candidate will behave in office. And yes, Hillary Clintons resistance to news conferences does not exactly augur an open hand with the news media either, and I dont add that as mere false balance. She should do more.Republicans, more than Democrats, have used the news media as a foil for decades. And neither of the last two Republicans to hold the White House  George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush  loved the news media. But neither of them denied credentials to reporters covering them. A notable exception: Vice President Dick Cheney, who tended to not make room for New York Times reporters on his plane. I personally was on the wrong end of that deal once.But the campaign still gave us credentials for his events. And, either way, we made do, because it is the job of reporters to get the facts  and present them fairly and accurately  regardless of the obstacles. Mr. Trump made the same point, noting that reporters without official credentials were welcome to come to his events on their own, and report from the crowd should they manage to obtain entree.Were not locking the doors where they cant get in, he said, though Mr. Schreckinger of Politico was recently escorted out of an event.But doesnt stripping credentials from out-of-favor reporters send a chill? They send a chill by showing what a disgrace the medias been, Mr. Trump said.Though Mr. Trump said his scraps with the media were not strategic, he noted they played well with some of his supporters. Some people think they dont like it, he said. Many people like it  they say, Theyre being punished for being dishonest.Brrrr."}
{"text": "The decisive moment for Irma Bohrquez-Geisler came on Christmas Eve: Go home and make holiday punch or go out to take pictures?You know what she chose.Ms. Bohrquez-Geisler had been documenting Staten Islands Mexican community since the early 2000s, and she knew she had to take advantage of any chance she had to photograph scenes of daily life. Being Mexican herself, she knew what was up when she spotted four girls at a local store buying ingredients for tamales. Wasting no time, she asked if she could make pictures while they made tamales.I had the pressure of cooking at home, but I took the opportunity of going to their home, Ms. Bohrquez-Geisler said. And they allowed me to be there. Thats how I sometimes approach people, just on the street when they are doing something I recognize is Mexican. I ask.Ms. Bohrquez-Geisler, who moved from Mexico City to Staten Island in 1992, did not start out to be a photographer.  Trained as a scientist (with a doctorate in ecological entomology, no less), she and her husband  a biologist and Brooklyn native  moved to the boroughs north shore when he took a job in computer development.  But she took art courses, which eventually led her to take a class in darkroom technique in 1999. And once she started taking pictures, it wasnt too long before she realized her countrymen  who at the time were sort of under the citys radar  would make for interesting subjects.It has since turned into a long-range project: from Day of the Dead celebrations and quinceaeras to mariachis and religious feasts, or just scenes of daily life in stores and at homes. Yet while she shared the culture of the people she photographed, she first had to earn their trust.It was not easy to do documentary work, she said. A lot of people were undocumented, so when I approached them, they questioned why I wanted to take pictures of them. They were always suspicious. I would just talk to them, letting them know I was from Mexico. If they talked about being from a place that I had visited, I would tell them, and they would realize we had something in common. That there was a connection.What they have in common now is a borough, one whose Mexican presence has grown tremendously. And while Ms. Bohrquez-Geisler has exhibited her work in traditional venues, she enjoys displaying at places where it can be seen by the people she photographs and their neighbors.Sharing these photos helps the Staten Island community understand who we are, she said. It gives us a sense of self-esteem and pride in our traditions and culture. It gives our neighbors an opportunity to understand who resides here in Staten Island. We all live together and have to accept each other. The idea is to build bridges and connections between people.Follow @dgbxny and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "IN GRATITUDEBy Jenny Diski250 pp. Bloomsbury. $26.Jenny Diski was dying. It was 10:07 a.m. on April 25; I Googled to make sure, before I filed this review, that she was still alive. She was. Her onc doc gave her a year in April 2015, which meant, if she survived another seven days, she would technically beat the projections. She did not. She died on the morning of April 28, 2016.Diski, as she makes vitally clear in her new memoir, In Gratitude, spent her every moment on earth beating the projections of authority figures. She overcame abusive and neglectful parents, foster homes, suicide attempts, repeated hospitalizations and the persistently gloomy conviction of relatives, caregivers, teachers, doctors and occasionally herself that she would fail at whatever she attempted.Diski did not fail. Over the past 30 years, Diski published 17 books of fiction and nonfiction and became a writer who commanded descriptions from reviewers like individual and wildly various; her books  such as her 1997 so-called travel book, Skating to Antarctica (which she described as being about Icebergs, mothers. That sort of thing)  all proof, as Giles Harvey wrote in a 2015 New York Times Magazine profile, of her spectacular originality.In September 2014, two months after the diagnosis, Diski began publishing essays in The London Review of Books about her illness and impending death. She was more than wary of the maudlin pitfalls (even she expressed disbelief at her choice to write another [expletive] cancer diary); as a result, her monthly testimonies are droll and uncertain and disobey time and, like memory itself, circle obsessively back to moments she finds most difficult to emotionally process, such as the realization that she will never see her small grandchildren become their own people.Diski also began publishing essays about her quasi-adoption by (and subsequent decades-long relationship with) the Nobel Prize-winning writer Doris Lessing. In Gratitude collects like metal filings around these two magnetic points  the functional end of Diskis life as a writer, and the functional beginning of it, due to Lessings rush into kindness and mentorship.While her sections about cancer offer unruly testimonies to sickness and dying (and, frankly, living), its in the sections about Lessing where Diskis idiosyncratic mind  and her bravery as a human confronting both imminent obliteration as well as certain vexing questions that, years later, shes still rolling around in her head  is most potently on display.Because of course the in gratitude of the books title contains, with one tap of the delete key, its negation. Diski riskily interrogates the ingratitude lurking beneath her feelings toward Lessing  the aristocratic savior (of the Communist-Sufi-literary variety) to her Dickensian waif. Diski was a classmate of Lessings son Peter, who urged his mother to invite Diski, 15 at the time and in a mental institution, to live with them.Diski accepted Lessings invitation and was tossed into a stimulating melee of writers and activists (among those at the Lessing dinner table were Ted Hughes and R.D. Laing). Yet she struggled with a substantial amount of anger at having to be grateful, the gratitude ever increasing, the bill never settled, and made more enraging by Doriss insistence that I wasnt to feel it. Lessing, to her credit, practiced what she preached  just stop being emotional, she was known to advise. Also known about Lessing: She had left two young children in Southern Rhodesia when she moved to London with Peter to pursue her dream of becoming a writer.In Gratitude stalks a particular early moment in Diskis relationship with Lessing. Diski, who had been shunted between various institutions since birth, who knew too well the fearful feeling of privation when your time as part of a system runs out, was terrified of being kicked out of this new system as well. She bumblingly confronted Lessing one night: I wanted to know if she liked me, and what on earth could be done if she didnt.Lessing reacted badly. The next morning, Diski found a letter from Lessing, accusing her of emotional blackmail.Diski is not condemning Lessing for her behavior. She is seeking, in these final moments of her own life, the fullest possible understanding of a woman who represented, despite her prickliness and remove, the closest thing she had to a family. Diski courageously and persistently speaks what many might deem unspeakable. She tries to comprehend Lessings ability to leave two children on a continent so far away she was guaranteed never to know or even much to see them. I get the need to flee, but no matter how I try to put myself in her place, I am perplexed by her emotional ability actually to do it.But Diski always lets Lessing respond from the grave. To the contention that she, Diski, could never imagine leaving her own daughter in order to fulfill her promise  Doris would say, I think, that I was lucky I didnt have to. Diski proves again and again her spectacular originality in her ability to empathize with as well as profess a total failure to comprehend the mind of another human being. These pages are evidence of her undiminished aptitude, even while her body was on the wane, to vigorously inhabit and investigate emotional spaces that shift and change shape as her sentences accrue.While I couldnt read In Gratitude without a persistent lump in my throat, and without the persistent awareness that its author was in a bed, somewhere, experiencing the very last days or hours or minutes of her life, Diskis final book proves transcendently disobedient, the most existence-affirming and iconoclastic defense a writer could mount against her own extinction."}

{"text": "Uber has raised more than $14 billion using all sorts of creative funding sources. Now it may add something new to the list: the leveraged loan market.The ride-hailing start-up is looking to issue as much as $2 billion in securities to investors, said a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.Representatives from all four banks declined to comment. The discussions were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.By tapping leveraged loans, Uber is adding to its trove of billions made up of many types of securities, which the company has been spending as it expands worldwide. Uber has raised equity from traditional venture capital sources, strategic corporate investors and private equity. This month, the company said that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund. Uber has also raised billions in convertible debt, which can be exchanged for equity at a future date.Uber has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash or debt at a rapid pace of once every few months. The company needs financing as it now operates in at least 69 countries and is fighting an expensive battle in China against a rival, Didi Chuxing, which is also raising money to expand.Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued by a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley.Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Ubers valuation of $62.5 billion  making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world  would not change with this new investment.Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors  some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing."}
{"text": "Austin, Tex.  ANY day now, the Supreme Court is going to decide whether women everywhere have full access to the right to an abortion, or just those who live in the right ZIP code  and whether any other woman in Texas, where I live, will have to go through what I did last fall.The abortion restrictions that the court is currently considering, which were passed in 2013 under the pretext of protecting womens health and safety, are really nothing more than unnecessary obstacles. In my life, they made a devastating situation much worse.Nearly six months after my abortion I still carry the scars of the experience  not of the procedure itself, which was a blessing I will never regret, but of how hard it was to get the care I needed in the state where I live.Im already a mother of two. And after years of being told I couldnt have any more children, I was shocked when my doctor told me last summer that I was pregnant. I wanted another child, and I immediately began prenatal care.Because of high blood pressure, mine was considered a high-risk pregnancy and I had to have ultrasound scans every two weeks. At my 12-week scan, I was told that there was a possible anomaly in the babys brain, but more testing was needed. For the next several weeks, I went in for additional tests. I barely slept.At my 16-week appointment, I knew that we would be able to get a diagnosis. Id know if the baby was healthy or not. The appointment was extremely long. At a certain point, they brought in a second ultrasound technician, and thats when I got really nervous.The doctor came to talk with me. He went slide by slide, picture by picture of my babys brain, face and head.This is what its supposed to look like, but this is what it actually looks like, he said, with each slide.The sonogram clearly showed my sons brain hadnt developed into two halves, and there was a hole between the brain and the spinal cord. My doctor confirmed the diagnosis: Alobar holoprosencephaly. My doctor gave me two options: I could try to carry the pregnancy to term, which would most likely end in either miscarriage or the delivery of a stillborn baby. At best, the doctors said the baby might live a couple of minutes. Or I could terminate the pregnancy.I was devastated by the diagnosis and these two terrible options. I knew immediately, though. Once I saw the pictures of his brain, I knew that continuing to carry this pregnancy would have traumatic emotional and physical consequences. And not just for me but also for my two children, who were excited about having another sibling.I asked the doctor if he could admit me to the hospital that day. He explained that I would need to be referred to an abortion provider.Unfortunately, the state of Texas had already passed an onerous anti-abortion law requiring, among other things, that doctors who perform the procedure have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that all health care facilities where abortions are performed meet specific building requirements. These measures forced the closure of more than half the abortion clinics in the state.After my doctor called the clinic, I was told I would have to wait three to four weeks for the next available appointment. There was no way I could wait that long. Not only would I be carrying a baby I knew wouldnt survive, but that kind of wait could push me past the 20-week mark after which almost all abortions are illegal in Texas.My doctor was able to find me an appointment the following week instead. But when I found out the procedure would then take three to four days to complete as a result of other restrictions that include mandatory counseling, a required sonogram and an additional 24-hour waiting period, I broke down.I didnt know how I was going to make it that long. One unnecessary additional day was one more than I could bear.Through a friend, I was connected to a clinic in Florida that caters to women who are terminating for medical reasons, and I spoke to the doctor and nurse there. The doctor explained that Florida didnt have a 24-hour waiting period, and they could get me in the next day.I booked the first plane ticket I found. I got a hotel room and rental car. I flew to Florida on Friday, and my procedure was over by Saturday afternoon. Including the cost of the procedure, I had to spend close to $5,000.I remember thinking: What happens to women in my situation who dont have the ability to do what I just did? My heart aches for those women.When I got back from Florida, I joined a support group for women who have ended wanted pregnancies. I shared my story, and ended up becoming involved in activism on behalf of other Texas women like me  women who needed abortion access, and couldnt get it.I had never been involved in activism before. I didnt know about these types of laws, or really have an opinion on abortion before I needed one myself.The restrictions on abortion procedures in Texas ultimately wont lower the number of people who need the procedure. They will just force women to take drastic measures. In fact, there is research that shows that since the Texas law passed, the number of women self-inducing abortion has grown. Other women are risking their jobs, spending their life savings, driving hundreds of miles, crossing state lines as I had to  all to exercise a right that the Constitution protects."}
{"text": "I wrote the following article, on increasing human-alligator conflicts in Florida, in the summer of 1988 for Discover Magazine. Im posting it here in full because of its relevance after the tragic loss of a toddler to an alligator on an artificial beach at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando. You can download a pdf here. Heres my related Dot Earth post: The Peril that Lurks as People and Reptiles Flourish in Florida.WATER HAZARDFirst published in Discover Magazine, Sept., 1988NEAR the end of a workday, Theron McBride dived beneath the surface of a man-made pond between the sixth and seventh holes of the Poinciana Country Club in Lake Worth, Florida, a sleepy town just inland from the splendor of Palm Beach. As a scuba diver for International Golf  a company that makes a business out of retrieving, refurbishing and reselling 6 million sunken golf balls a year  he spends much of each week submerged in water hazards.On this sunny Tuesday afternoon the term water hazard would take on added significance. McBride had brought his girlfriend along so she could see what he did for a living. As he swam back and forth, scanning the mud for more balls to add to a mesh bag that already bulged with 400 or more, she saw an alligator pop out of a culvert and swim straight toward the spot where McBride was diving.She started screaming, and a couple of golfers started throwing balls at me to get my attention, but I didnt notice a thing, he recalls. hen he felt a sharp tug on one of his flippers, and the next thing he knew, he was being dragged to the bottom, foot first. McBride twisted around to see that an eight-foot-long alligator, a reptilian relic unchanged since the Oligocene Epoch 30 million years ago, had clamped its long jaws on his flipper.After a brief struggle McBride was able to kick his foot free, leaving the flipper behind. Both human and alligator surfaced and swam briskly in opposite directions. My girlfriend freaked, he says.This was clearly a case for Lieutenant Dick Lawrence, a wildlife officer for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. Several days after the incident Lawrence arrived at the country club, equipped with the odd and slightly gruesome tools of his trade: a fishing rod with a four-pointed hook on the line, a pole tipped with a wire noose, and a roll of electricians tape. Within two hours he had snagged, wrestled, taped, and hog-tied the eight hundred twenty-fifth and eight hundred twenty-sixth alligators of his career  McBrides attacker and another, shorter animal.These days, more than half of Lawrences time is devoted to answering complaints about alligators. As increasing numbers of northerners flee to the Sunshine State, development is rapidly spreading inland from the states sparkling shores toward its flat, wet, sparsely populated interior. Ranks of expensive homes, often surrounding private golf courses and chains of man-made ponds, are being built on terrain that is transmogrified swamp.With the help of a network of 14 professional trappers, Lawrence, the alligator coordinator for a large swath of south Florida, responds to complaints ranging from alligators threatening pets to alligators in swimming pools. (Usually, when they end up in pools, its somebody pulling a prank, Lawrence says.)There are four other regions in the state with similar networks of coordinators and trappers. Some of the complaints are urgent. But many of the panicked calls are unwarranted, Lawrence says, coming from transplanted northerners whove never seen anything more exotic than a cockroach.Until recently the captured alligators would have been relocated deeper into the swamps. Unfortunately for the alligators, that is no longer possible. Floridas human population explosion has been paralleled by an alligator baby boom. After decades of conservation and successful battles to stem poaching, the alligator population has grown to at least one million.The success of the species has meant that unlucky gators that come into conflict with humans are now taken away and killed. Its too bad, but its the gators that get the worst of it, says Lawrence, a burly, tanned man with a fast pace to his southern accent that hints at his Minnesota origins. The fact is, what we have here isnt a gator problem, its a people problem. But what am I supposed to do, refuse to catch one? Theres always the chance that the alligator will do somebody harm, and Id look pretty foolish. With 71 people attacked in Florida in the last ten years, he cant take that chance.~ ~A WEEK after McBrides misadventure, Lawrence is in his cluttered office, preparing to head out after alligator number 827. He starts the day over coffee and a pile of eight fresh alligator complaints that he grabs from his in-box. Holding a form at arms length, Lawrence squints to find the address. His farsightedness is troublesome in the office, but it proves valuable in the field, where he must scan the wind-dappled surface of ponds for a tiny quartet of protrusions  paired eyes and nostrils.The form, filled out by Game Commission employees who take complaints over the telephone, lists a series of questions designed to determine whether an alligator is truly a nuisance or if the complainant is simply someone with an overactive imagination or unreasonable fears: Is there human activity in the water? Is the alligator threatening pets, livestock; etc.? Is the alligator coming out on land?Lots of people from up north are buying homes around here, Lawrence says. If they buy a home next to a canal, theyre bound to see gators. The next thing you know, I get a call: Oh my God, its gonna get my kids! You explain to them hes just there cause hes coldblooded and hes lying in the sun trying to raise his body temperature. Damn, a gators main diet is apple snails, raccoons, sick fish, ducks, turtles. But they dont believe you.Newcomers to Florida generally arent aware that the alligator probably poses less of a threat than other, less obtrusive organisms, he says. You dont see us getting calls about the Bufo toads, with their toxin that can kill a dog in a heartbeat. Or the purple-tailed skunk, which can send a cat into convulsions. Or water moccasins. These are the real hazards down here. There are a lot of things more serious than an ol alligator laying on the bank.For each nuisance alligator a permit is typed up and given to a trapper in the appropriate region. The trapper then has 90 days to catch the suspect animal. If he hasnt caught it in that time, then its pretty obvious its not much of a nuisance, says Lawrence. From July 1986 to June 1987, there were 6,784 complaints registered in the state, with 3,634 alligators captured as a result. [In 2014, 6,706 nuisance gators were captured and killed.]Lawrence deems several of this days complaints legitimate. Big alligators can do harm: they pose at the very least a threat to pets and livestock, and at worst, to people. A dog running along a canal, a toddler falling into the water, or a careless swimmer are all potential prey for these animals, whose jaws snap shut reflexively when they encounter just about anything.On June 4, 1988, for instance, a four-year-old girl who was walking a puppy along the shore of a lake in Port Charlotte was snatched by a ten-and-a-half-foot alligator. Another fatality had occurred the previous summer at Wakulla Springs State Park, when a skin diver ventured outside a roped-off swimming area. A little while later, as tourists in a jungle boat marveled at the scenery just down the Wakulla River from the park, they were startled to see an 11-foot, 415-pound alligator swimming along with the body of the diver in its jaws.An eleven-footer is a big gator to have around, Lawrence says. There is no way that a gator that big is not going to do something bad to somebody sometime. Lawrence heads out into the bright day, replacing his reading glasses with sleek black sunglasses. He stops at the home of one of the trappers, Lee Kramer, a lanky blond man with sun-cured skin, sleepy-but-sharp hound-dog eyes, and a hunting knife and electronic beeper attached to his python-skin belt.Kramer seems to like large animals with mean tempers and lots of teeth. Before turning to alligator trapping, which provides most of his income now, the former Navy and commercial pilot ran a 44-foot sport-fishing boat, often taking fishermen out in quest of sharks. He generates enough income from the state-authorized sale of the alligator hides and meat (somewhat of a delicacy in Florida, along the lines of venison) to make a living. Besides, he says, Its fun. It stops the general flow of bar conversation  especially since Crocodile Dundee hit the screen.Kramer trails behind Lawrences patrol car in a rugged blue pickup festooned with stickers announcing that he is an AUTHORIZED ALLIGATOR AGENT/TRAPPER and a license plate that reads EL GATOR.Driving south on Route 95, Lawrence reflects on his 18 years on the force. I used to be against killing the gators, he says. Nine years ago we used to release them. But then we started tagging some, and we found that thirty days later theyd turn up just a block or two from where they were caught.Sometimes an alligator would travel as much as 50 miles through south Floridas network of flood control canals to get back to its home. As both alligators and people grew more numerous and incidents occurred more frequently, Lawrence says, we found that wildlife officers were so busy gator trapping that they had no time for anything else. In those days I would have four or five gators in the back seat, crawling up the windows.He passes a billboard advertising the Indian Spring Golf and Tennis Country Club, which sprawls over a broad expanse just off the road. That there five years ago used to be some of the best dove and quail habitat in the county. Now look at it, he says, snorting. And theyre still building.The two vehicles are waved through the security gates of a posh development called Delray Dunes Golf and Country Club, and they park in front of a gracious ranch house with a backyard  like that of every house around  that runs down to the edge of a serpentine pond.The duo greets a homeowner, who stands by his screened-in swimming pool and points to an end of the pond where a nine-footer has been seen. Kramer scours the mud along the shore. He spots long, scratchy claw marks that could only be those of an alligator. In the silty shallows he points out a faint line  a tail drag, he calls it.As Kramer scans the pond with binoculars, Lawrence stands on the steep bank, cups his hands around his mouth, and from somewhere down between his throat and his diaphragm generates a resonant nyuk, nyuk, nyuk sound. Thats the sound a baby gator makes, he says. Itll usually get their attention. For those days when Lawrence doesnt come along, Kramer keeps in his pickup a portable stereo tape player with a cassette filled with 20 minutes of Lawrences nyuks.The only signs of action are occasional flurried splashes as largemouth bass chase minnows in the shallows. Should get my bass rod out of the truck, Kramer says. We could do double duty. Then a vague black shape breaks the surface. A bystander loudly sounds the alarm.Turtle, says Lawrence without a second glance. After a half hour of alligator grunts and searching, Kramer spots something. I see bubbles off to your left, he tells Lawrence. Fishing pole in hand, Lawrence jogs off along the bank, his holstered revolver flopping against his hip. He skirts the pond until he reaches the far side and before he comes to a stop starts casting his weighted, barbed hook across the glassy surface and reeling it in. Nothing doing.\nHe sends the hook past a swirl in the water, and it briefly snags something. Lawrence heaves mightily, rocking back on his heels and whipping the rod into a question-mark curve. A black form thrashes the surface into foam, then the line slackens and the water calms. Damn! he hisses. Lost him.The alligator has vanished. After a few moments Lawrence catches his breath. Oh, well, if you caught every one of them, itd just be a job.ON TO the next stop  a brand new development called Mahogany Bay. A neat row of months-old ranch houses abuts a man-made pond. Nearby, chattering sprinklers steadily water the synthetic hills and vales of a freshly sculpted and seeded golf course. A loud yelp breaks the stillness: A snake! A woman rushes out the back door of one of the identical houses, flailing a yellow plastic broom. Propelled by the broom, a dark squiggly object flies through the air across the neatly mowed lawn, landing at the ponds edge.Such is life in south Florida, says Kramer, watching from the other side of the pond. Lawrence returns from scouting an end of the pond where hed spotted a long-dead animal that might have been a raccoon or cat, decomposing on the shore  a sure lure for a gator. Nothing there. I may as well check this out, Lawrence says, nodding toward the distressed woman. He races off in his car, bouncing across the intervening moguls of the golf course. By the time he gets to the house, the snake has slithered into the tea-dark water. When the woman describes it as green, he reassures her. Couldnt be a water moccasin. Theyre black, and their mouths are white and puffy  cottonmouths.Then he gets on to the business of the day. Were looking for an alligator thats been hanging around this pond. Seen any? The woman hasnt, but a neighbor says a large alligator had been sunning on the bank at the other end of the pond a couple of days ago. If that carcass back there hasnt drawn him out, hes long gone, Lawrence says. He and Kramer scan the pond one more time, then cross a rise to check out a drainage canal. There are five thousand miles of canals in my territory alone, Kramer says. Thats how the gators get around. The trappers eyes light up for a second time that day as they spy several largemouth bass massacring minnows in the shallows. Damn bass are cannibals today, Lawrence says.Hunters Run is next, an enormous expanse of verdant fairways and perfect greens, laced with a network of canals and ponds. This place is just crawling with gators, Lawrence says. Were only a few miles from the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge  take one alligator out of a pond, and there is sure to be a replacement within weeks.A golfer passes, driving a humming electric golf cart emblazoned with SYLVIA . Seen any gators today? Lawrence asks. The golfer claims to have seen a 15-footer. Politely feigning credulousness, Lawrence says, You see him again, you call me, yhear? Once the golfer is out of earshot Lawrence says, Golly, Id make love to a gator that big.Alligator mississippiensis does occasionally get that large, but in 18 years, Lawrence says, the biggest he ever caught was a 12-foot 8-incher that used to bask on a runway at West Palm Beach International Airport. In an incident that made the local news, Lawrence was lowered upside down into a storm drain to get a noose on the 600-pound animal; the alligator had to be hauled out with a backhoe. Lest he get cocky about that achievement, Kramer reminds him that his biggest alligator was\n13 feet, 6 inches. At the next tee a golfer sets his spikes, takes a practice swing, then proceeds to drive his ball straight into a stand of tall pine trees. I knew hed do that, Lawrence says. See how he keeps his feet close together?The convoy of two winds its way around the course, pausing politely as golfers make their shots, then continuing on to the next water hazard. As he crests a knoll overlooking a large pond, Lawrence stomps on the brakes and leaps out, rod in hand. Hes right there! Lawrence shouts to Kramer, whos already hotfooting it toward the water with his own rod. The water boils right at the shoreline. Lawrence nearly slides into the pond as he casts and hauls back with a sharp grunt. But the alligators leathery back defies the hooks honed barbs. Lawrence falls over backward as the hook zings back at him and a large alligator makes for the depths.A few minutes later they spot an alligator surfacing toward the far shore: a black lumpy line in a blinding sea of wavetop reflections. Lawrences blood is up now (he is an avid fisherman and deer hunter as well as wildlife officer). After a long, slow morning, everything happens in fast motion. Lawrence tosses the rod into the car and races off across the course. Several elderly golfers who have arrived at a nearby tee gawk. Go get him! one yells.Lawrence speeds around the pond, his car door swinging open because the rod didnt fit inside, following golf-cart paths that arent really wide enough for his Chevrolet Celebrity. He narrowly misses a line of palm trees. His head hits the roof as the car catapults over a bump. Once again he runs to the waters edge, casting and heaving, casting and heaving.The water erupts about 50 yards from shore. Now Ive got you, Lawrence howls, and then he starts to talk to himself as the lunging reptile threatens to jerk the rod from his hands. Hold him, hold on. Perhaps because of his penchant for sport fishing, Lawrence only uses 30-pound-test line to catch 100- pound-plus alligators. Slowly he works the alligator toward shore, using the relentless pull of the flexing rod to tire it out.The alligator is just a few yards away, half-hidden by the brownish water, when Kramer rushes into the pond and heaves a heavier line, tied to a second hook, over the dark silhouette. The black-backed, yellow-bellied animal slaps and twists and rolls and claps its tooth-studded jaws, trying to escape, but its no use.\nLawrence drops his rod and leaps onto the beached alligator, straddling it like a horse and forcing its snout to the mud with his hands. He grasps its closed mouth with his fingers and arches its head up. Tape! Tape!Kramer grabs a roll of electricians tape and quickly winds it around and around the snout, which Lawrence is still holding shut with his hands. The alligators four-foot tail lashes side to side.The taping and trussing takes five more minutes, until the alligator has its forelimbs tied and mouth secured. We cant take chances, says Lawrence. One time I taped up a gator, a ten-footer. Had a new officer with me. The gator was hissing and this guy was walking around it. The gators tail whipped around, and the officer jumped straight up, but he didnt jump high enough. The tail took his feet out from under him. On the way down, the tail came back and slapped him in the head. Knocked him out cold.Several golf carts pull up to the spot on the fairway to where Lawrence and Kramer have carried the alligator. The golfers gather around and stare quietly at the immobilized reptile, which emits a low, steady growl and moves its snout back and forth. Where are you going to take it? asks one golfer.  Its going to be killed, Lawrence answers. Dont got a place to put them anymore.Oh, says the golfer, looking surprised.Lawrence and Kramer heave the heavy animal into the back of the pickup. After Kramer takes it home, the alligator will be shot once in the head or struck with an axe. It is then drained of blood, washed in soap and water to clean the hide, chilled and skinned. The hide is scraped, salted, and cured. Periodically, the hides are sent to Gainesville, where they are graded and auctioned, with exotic leather dealers from around the world placing bids. The state gets $30 per alligator, which helps pay for the alligator-control program; the rest of the money goes to the trapper.At the last sale, hides went for $42.70 per foot, says Lawrence. At that rate, a 10-foot alligator means $397; the trapper can also sell the alligator tail meat, which can fetch from $5 to $8 per pound. The meat is sold in boxes marked with a seal that proves it was taken under permit. They sell all they can get, Lawrence says. You cant supply the restaurants with enough. Lawrence himself is not a lover of grilled gator tail. I like it, but I wouldnt drive out of my way to get it.Just before Kramer drives away, a deeply tanned greenskeeper looks into the bed of the truck. I just had a gator burger last week, he says.One week later Lawrence is back in his office, staring at a new pile of alligator complaints. Hes already up to gator number 832.As he heads out the door, bound for a retirement village to capture number 833, he tells a secretary, Ill be back around three, if the gators dont get me."}
{"text": "Theme parks in Orlando like Disneys Magic Kingdom Park and Epcot, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando are being more vigilant following the shooting in the city early Sunday morning at Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead.In an email, a spokeswoman for Disney, Jacquee Wahler, wrote, Unfortunately, weve all been living in a world of uncertainty, and during this time we have increased our security measures across our properties, adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers [metal detectors], additional canine units, and law enforcement officers on site, as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.Few of the representatives for the other parks were willing to comment on any specific security measures being implemented following the catastrophe over the weekend, but a handful did say that they were being more vigilant.In an email, a SeaWorld spokeswoman, Suzanne Pelisson Beasley, said: The safety of our ambassadors, guests and animals has always been our top priority. Our security teams work closely with law enforcement and we have enhanced security measures at all our parks.Also, a Universal Orlando spokesman, Tom Schroder, said that guest safety is the parks top priority, but that the company doesnt discuss security plans and procedures.Although the theme parks may be more hesitant to share specifics on extra security measures since the weekend, many, including Universal, SeaWorld and the four Walt Disney World theme parks, started giving security increased attention last December by adding metal detectors at entryways.Legoland, a Lego-themed park in Winter Haven, Fla., about 45 minutes from Orlando, added metal-detecting wands and also began searching guests bags before they entered.A Legoland spokesman, David Brady, said that the new measures went into place to prepare for the heavy attendance expected during the December holiday season.Orlando is one of the top tourist destinations in the United States and continues to grow in popularity, according to statistics from VisitOrlando, the citys official tourism association. In the last week of January, occupancy rates in the city were up 18 percent over 2015. Also, 66.1 million people visited Orlando in 2015, making it the most visited destination in the United States."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  High-speed internet service can be defined as a utility, a federal court has ruled in a sweeping decision clearing the way for more rigorous policing of broadband providers and greater protections for web users.The decision affirmed the governments view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision.The 2-to-1 decision from a three-judge panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers.Those rules, created by the Federal Communications Commission in early 2015, started a huge legal battle as cable, telecom and wireless internet providers sued to overturn regulations that they said went far beyond the F.C.C.s authority and would hurt their businesses. On the other side, millions of consumers and giant tech firms rallied in favor of the regulations. President Obama also called for the strictest possible mandates on broadband providers.The courts decision upheld the F.C.C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has broad-reaching implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online.After a decade of debate and legal battles, todays ruling affirms the commissions ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protections  both on fixed and mobile networks  that will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement.The two judges who ruled in favor of the F.C.C. emphasized the importance of the internet as an essential communications and information platform for consumers.Over the past two decades, this content has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from profound actions like choosing a leader, building a career, and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie, wrote David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan, the judges who wrote the opinion.But the legal battle over the regulations is most likely far from over. The cable and telecom industries have signaled their intent to challenge any unfavorable decision, possibly taking the case to the Supreme Court.AT&T immediately said it would continue to fight.We have always expected this issue to be decided by the Supreme Court and we look forward to participating in that appeal, said David McAtee II, the senior executive vice president and general counsel for AT&T.For now, the decision limits the ability of broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon to shape the experience of internet users. Without net neutrality rules, the broadband providers could be inclined to deliver certain content on the web at slower speeds, for example, making the streams on Netflix or YouTube buffer or shut down. Such business decisions by broadband providers would have created fast and slow lanes on the internet, subjecting businesses and consumers to extra charges and limited access to content online, the F.C.C. has argued.This is an enormous win for consumers, said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. It ensures the right to an open internet with no gatekeepers.The 184-page ruling also opens a path for new limits on broadband providers beyond net neutrality. Already, the F.C.C. has proposed privacy rules for broadband providers, curbing the ability of companies like Verizon and AT&T to collect and share data about broadband subscribers.Google and Netflix support net neutrality rules and have warned government officials that without regulatory limits, broadband providers will have an incentive to create business models that could harm consumers. They argue that broadband providers could degrade the quality of downloads and streams of online services to extract tolls from web companies or to promote unfairly their own competing services or the content of partners.The courts ruling was a certainty for the F.C.C. Two of the three judges who heard the case late last year agreed that wireless broadband services were also common carrier utility services that were subject to anti-blocking and discrimination rules, a decision protested by wireless carriers including AT&T and Verizon Wireless.In the opinion, the two judges in favor of the rules said internet users dont feel the difference between fixed-wire broadband and mobile service. To an iPad user, whose device switches automatically between Wi-Fi and wireless networks, the governments oversight of those technologies should not differ, they said.Tech firms cheered the decision, which they said would be particularly helpful to start-ups that did not have the resources to fight gatekeepers of the web.Today marks a huge victory for the millions of microbusinesses who depend on the open internet to reach consumers and compete in the global marketplace, said Althea Erickson, the senior director of global policy at the online crafts marketplace Etsy.In a statement, the cable industrys biggest lobbying group highlighted the comments of the dissenting judge, Stephen Williams, and said that its members were reviewing the opinion. The group also said broadband legislation by Congress was a better alternative to the F.C.C.s classification of internet business as a utility.While this is unlikely the last step in this decade-long debate over internet regulation, we urge bipartisan leaders in Congress to renew their efforts to craft meaningful legislation that can end ongoing uncertainty, promote network investment and protect consumers, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said in a statement.In his lengthy dissenting opinion, Mr. Williams called the rules an unreasoned patchwork that will discourage competition in the broadband industry.The biggest threat to broadband providers is the potential of any regulations to hurt the rates they charge for the service, analysts said. The F.C.C. has promised it will not impose rate regulations on the firms like it does for phone companies.The pendulum has today swung a bit further in the direction of long-term price regulation, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson.The F.C.C. was divided along party lines on the rules. It began its quest for net neutrality rules in 2009, with two previous attempts at creating rules overturned by the same court.In a statement, Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner who was among a minority who opposed the regulation of broadband as a utility, urged cable and telecom firms to keep going with their legal challenge.I continue to believe that these regulations are unlawful, and I hope that the parties challenging them will continue the legal fight, he said."}
{"text": "So what does Microsoft get for $26.2 billion?On Monday, the worlds largest software company paid that much for LinkedIn, the worlds premier online job site, reports Nick Wingfield. It is by far the largest acquisition in Microsofts history, though not the biggest deal of 2016. That is Shires $30 billion purchase of Baxalta, another pharmaceutical company.Drug company deals are more straightforward though, and the price is usually based on what the acquirer hopes to squeeze out of the products and talent. Technology mergers tend to require a little more imagination to justify their cost.LinkedIn may have 400 million members, as the people who post their job data there are called, but in 2015 it had revenue of about $3 billion, and posted a net loss of $166 million. The year before it lost only $15 million on $2.2 billion in revenue. It is hard to see why Microsoft paid a premium of about 50 percent of Fridays LinkedIn share price.But think like a tech chief executive, using the key values of relevance, synergy, data and growth. Microsoft is in the midst of an epochal transition from the time of personal computers and computer servers to machine-based intelligence everywhere, via cloud computing and mobile devices. Where once it owned the desktop, now it strives with the likes of Google and Amazon for a $1 trillion prize, the global market for corporate computing.At the end of last March, Microsoft had $105 billion in cash, far more than the competition. Spending some of that on a well-regarded cloud company it can transition over to its own enormous cloud system makes Microsoft ever more relevant in this world.Unlike Google and Amazon, Microsoft already has a large presence in corporate software, and some of LinkedIns functions will fit nicely into its human resources and financial planning products. Microsoft is also trying to increase the corporate utility of Skype, the online communications company it bought for $8.5 billion in 2011.Bolted onto LinkedIn, it could be a means not just of recruitment, but of organizing teams. Much of LinkedIns proposition has been that it will be the core of a future in which there is much less lifetime employment and lots more freelancing, consulting and other independent contracting across the globe.LinkedIn already has probably the worlds best trove of data on the work people are doing and looking for, and one of the best-regarded teams of data scientists in tech. That information and those people will now work with counterparts in areas like online search, gaming and artificial intelligence, or A.I.Data is not just inherently important these days; it is a key asset for improving the performance of A.I. systems. Big data sets lend themselves to better results (incidentally, a reason many in tech are starting to worry about the data owned by the biggest companies.) Buying LinkedIn didnt just improve the likely performance of Microsofts own algorithms. It took a large potential data resource off the table for Amazon and Google.That is, in large part, the positive situation  which is how such enormous acquisitions should begin. Now for the hard part of making it all work as planned."}
{"text": "LONDON  Few areas of scientific investigation are more controversial than embryo research, yet few are more brimming with potential. The field promises valuable insights into early human development and new possibilities for treating diseases and disorders.For more than 35 years, there has been broad international agreement that no scientist can experiment on an embryo that is more than 14 days old. This red line was established as scientific guidance in the United States in 1979, and it was incorporated into British law after the 1984 Warnock inquiry into in vitro fertilization. Other nations, including Australia, Sweden and China, have since adopted the same limit, either in law or through scientific regulation.Until now, the 14-day limit has not been a particular issue because scientists, in practice, have been unable to grow embryos in vitro for more than nine days. But two research groups, one in America, the other in Britain, have recently reported being able to sustain human embryos in vitro for up to 13 days.This technological advance has reopened the ethical debate about the 14-day limit. Many scientists chafe at restrictions on their ability to learn more about life and potentially create breakthrough therapies. Critics, especially religious believers, are horrified because they believe that, in the words of Philippa Taylor, head of public policy at the Christian Medical Fellowship, all embryos are very young human beings.It is a debate with important consequences not just for embryo research, but also for wider debates over abortion and infanticide. At the heart of all this lies a central question: Where do we draw the line between a blob of cells and a human being with moral status?The intractability of this issue reflects the fact that, as a matter of biology, the development of human life is rarely characterized by clear lines. A cell created by a fusion of egg and sperm is (if we ignore the possibility of cloning) a necessary condition of being a human being, but not a sufficient one.A human being is created in the long journey from being a single, microscopic cell to becoming a self-conscious moral agent. That change does not happen at any one instant, but slowly over time, so that, almost imperceptibly, a qualitatively different being is created.Some religious believers insist on a strong red line at the very beginning of this journey. A fertilized egg, they insist, is a human being and has moral status. Many object to any form of either abortion or embryo experimentation.Others, like the philosopher Peter Singer, support both, but question whether a moral distinction exists between a fetus and an infant. Humans, according to Professor Singers critique of speciesism, have no intrinsic claim to life. The interests of individuals depend upon their cognitive abilities and on characteristics like rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness. Infants, Professor Singer has argued, lack all that. Killing them, therefore, cannot be equated with killing normal human beings, or any other self-conscious beings, he writes. Killing an adult chimpanzee would be, for him, a more immoral act than killing a 1-year-old child, because the chimpanzee has greater cognitive capacities.Neither stance seems to me plausible. The idea that a blob of cells is a human being and should have the same moral status as a child seems untenable. It is equally implausible, however, to claim that there is no moral difference between how an embryo and an infant may be treated.While the creation of a human being is a process, not an instant, there are moral boundaries that mark qualitative shifts. One such boundary is birth. A fetus is a physical part of womans body. Abortion is not about the killing of another human being, but about a woman exercising her right to control her own body.Birth transforms that relationship. An entirely physical attachment becomes primarily, and increasingly, social. A newborn child belongs to the moral community of humans. That is why abortion is permissible, but infanticide illegal.How does the debate about the time limit for embryo research fit in? The 14-day limit is arbitrary, but it reflects the time by which, in a normal pregnancy, an embryo would be implanted in the womb. Before then, an embryo can divide into two, creating twins, or two different embryos can fuse together to create a single individual. So, many argue, implantation is the point at which the individuality of an embryo is assured  or when an individual soul is bestowed by God.The notion that a cluster of cells that can no longer split should have such special moral status is dubious. The anomaly of the limit to embryo research becomes evident when we compare it to abortion laws. In Britain, for instance, the normal limit for abortion is 24 weeks. It seems nonsensical for it to be legal to destroy a 24-week embryo in the name of a womans right to choose, but illegal for scientists to culture an embryo in vitro for more than 14 days for potentially lifesaving research.The 14-day rule, as an opinion article by researchers and a bioethicist in the journal Nature noted, was never intended to be a bright line denoting the onset of moral status in human embryos. Rather, it was designed to carve out a space for scientific inquiry while respecting different views on human embryo research.It was, in other words, a convenient fudge between the needs of science and the opposition particularly of religious groups. With the advance of technology, that compromise is no longer workable.Since there are no sharp lines in the development of a human being, any time limit on embryo research will necessarily be arbitrary. The real point is not to provide spurious moral claims about whatever limit is set, but to win public support for that decision. The line may be arbitrary, but the debate should be rational."}
{"text": "Only days after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida, the judge in a hate-crime murder case in New York invoked the massacre on Tuesday as he sentenced a man to 40 years to life in prison.The defendant, Elliot Morales, 36, was convicted in March of murder as a hate crime for killing Mark Carson, a gay black man, in the West Village in Manhattan three years ago, after spewing homophobic invectives at the victim and his companion.I cant help but perceive or observe the parallel tragedy in Orlando, the judge, A. Kirke Bartley Jr., said as he imposed the sentence in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. That parallel is revealed in hatred, self-loathing, fear and death.Mr. Morales was convicted after a two-week trial during which he represented himself, assuming the dual roles of defendant and defense lawyer. Addressing Mr. Morales, Justice Bartley said the defendants ability to appear calm, intelligent, well prepared, well behaved could not deter from the fact that he also seemed to be something worthy of a character in a Stephen King novel  in short a monster.Mr. Morales, yours is a legacy of death and fear, nothing more nothing less, the judge said.Looking at a stone-faced crowd of Mr. Carsons family and friends, Mr. Morales insisted that the killing was neither bias-motivated nor purposeful.What happened is a tragic accident, he said. In no part was it based on my bias toward anyones sexual relationship.Then, turning toward the judge, he added, It is beyond my comprehension how someone like myself who happens to be bisexual and part of the L.G.B.T. community can be falsely accused and then convicted of a hate crime.Jurors deliberated for two days before rejecting Mr. Moraless contention that his intimate relationships with transgender women proved he was not homophobic and that he did not kill Mr. Carson, 32, out of hatred toward gay people.Instead, the jurors saw Mr. Moraless behavior that evening as underscoring such prejudice.Before his fatal encounter with Mr. Carson in May 2013, Mr. Morales stormed the Annisa restaurant on Barrow Street shouting antigay slurs and brandishing a weapon, after an employee there upbraided him for urinating on the sidewalk.Mr. Morales left enraged and soon spotted Mr. Carson and Danny Robinson, a pair of friends from Brooklyn, dressed in shorts and tank tops. Mr. Morales taunted the men, calling them gay wrestlers and faggots. The friends challenged Mr. Moraless mocking tone, and the confrontation moved into the shadow of a closed bookstore. There, Mr. Morales pulled out a revolver and shot Mr. Carson in the face while Mr. Robinson called the police.Mr. Morales often flailed in offering explanations for his actions. After fleeing the scene of the murder, he told apprehending officers that he shot Mr. Carson because he tried to act tough. In a video taken during his arrest that Judge Bartley described as chilling, Mr. Morales laughed maniacally and exclaimed, Diagnosis dead, doctor!At the trial itself, Mr. Morales claimed he acted in self-defense, afraid that the phone Mr. Robinson had retrieved was a weapon. The prosecution thwarted that notion, saying Mr. Morales had acted out of bigotry and unjustifiable rage, not fear.During the sentencing, Mr. Morales first said that the shooting was more so reckless than intentional, then, in an inexplicable tirade, insinuated that emergency medical technicians had mistreated Mr. Carson, leading to his death.The jury countenanced none of those justifications, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., lauded the stiff sentence. Any life lost to gun violence is a tragedy for our city, Mr. Vance said in a statement. But homophobic, hate-fueled incidents like this one are particularly unconscionable. As we mourn the lives lost in Orlando, we remain committed to doing everything we can to combat and prevent crimes against L.G.B.T. New Yorkers.The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported in 2015 that 18.6 percent of the 5,462 so-called single-bias hate crimes in the previous year were because of the victims sexual orientation; 47 percent were attributable to race. A study by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs shows that 24 killings of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, and of those who are H.I.V.-positive, were reported in 2015, a 20 percent increase from the previous year. But their advocates have long contended that such numbers are underreported.Shannon Lucey, the lead prosecutor, described Mr. Morales in court as having a lot of self-loathing issues. She noted that while he had sexual relationships with transgender people, he never appeared with them in public. Seeing Mr. Robinson and Mr. Carter together, Ms. Lucey argued, may have prompted Mr. Moraless discomfort with his own sexuality.After the verdict was rendered in March, one juror said that Mr. Moraless actions that night showed that he was kind of categorizing people, in a manner that exposed his bias against gay people and that culminated in the shooting of Mr. Carson.Still, for many, the ruling provides little solace.Sometimes a criminal case gives people a feeling of closure, but what happened in Orlando just overshadows everything at the moment and may well for a long time, said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Robinson was not able to attend the sentencing, but offered a statement saying, The guilt of asking him to go out with me that night, its like I feel its my fault, he said.Outside the courtroom, Florine Bumpars, an aunt of Mr. Carson, spoke through tears as she castigated Mr. Morales.He got what he deserves, Ms. Bumpars said. If he was sorry, he wouldve never did it."}
{"text": "Of the Mets many recent health concerns, one had resolved itself by Tuesday. Manager Terry Collins was back on the job, delivering the lineup card as usual before the Mets played the Pittsburgh Pirates at Citi Field. He had felt disoriented before Sundays game in Milwaukee  dehydration, he guessed  and was taken to a hospital. But his tests had found nothing alarming.Freaky things happen, Collins said before batting practice. Im just glad its done, and Im glad Im sitting where I am right now.If only the Mets injured players could recover as quickly as their 67-year-old manager. The lineup was missing five starters from opening day. To the usual disabled-list trio of David Wright (neck), Travis dArnaud (right shoulder) and Lucas Duda (back), the Mets began Tuesday without Neil Walker (back) and Michael Conforto (left wrist).For six innings, their patchwork lineup had no hits off Jameson Taillon, a heralded right-hander making his second major league appearance. Curtis Granderson rolled a single to right to start the seventh, but the Mets went quietly in a 4-0 defeat. Collins said he would not criticize his offense, which managed just three hits in all.Our lineup is what it is because thats what we have, he said. Im not going to sit here and complain about it. Weve got to get it done.Walkers back flares up every year and always recovers, Collins said, though Walker could not get loose enough to pinch-hit on Tuesday. Confortos status, though, is more tenuous.Conforto had a cortisone shot in his wrist on Monday and struck out as a pinch-hitter Tuesday. After hitting .365 in April, he has batted .150 in the month and a half since, with just 10 walks in 132 plate appearances. Collins said Conforto would start again on Thursday, but General Manager Sandy Alderson acknowledged that he might benefit from a stint in the minors.Thats sort of a gut feel; theres no perfect answer or formula for when its right for a player to go down and when its right for a player to fight through it, Alderson said. If you remember, when we brought him up, one of the reasons we did was because of his approach and his foundation, in terms of decision-making at the plate. And thats probably something hes struggled with over the last few weeks and something weve got to get back  and continue to remind him thats how he got here.Alderson said a brief demotion seemed to help dArnaud after a prolonged slump two years ago. DArnaud was 25 then, two years older than Conforto is now. If they so choose, the Mets may have a good option to replace Conforto in Brandon Nimmo: Like Conforto, he is a left-handed hitting outfielder and former first-round pick, and he has been on a tear at Class AAA Las Vegas lately, hitting .474 in his last 10 games before Tuesday.Alderson said Nimmo was putting himself in position to be considered for New York, which could be significant. The promotion of Conforto last July, and the professional at-bats he brought with him, proved an important part of the Mets surge.Elsewhere, the Mets choices seem limited. They have already found veterans from outside the organization during the season: catcher Rene Rivera, first baseman James Loney and infielder Kelly Johnson. All are best as bench players, but they are more capable fill-ins than the Mets early replacements last season, when injuries also decimated the lineup.The deficiencies are similar, Alderson said. The question is whether were better positioned to overcome them.That is not the only question, though. The other concerns the competition. Last summer, the Mets were chasing an underachieving Washington Nationals team that was plagued by injuries and led by an overmatched manager, Matt Williams. This year, the Nationals are healthy and thriving under the sage Dusty Baker.The Mets lag five games behind in the National League East standings, though they are leading for the second N.L. wild-card berth.Weve got a lot of games with the Nationals left  a lot of them, he said, accurately (the teams meet 13 more times).The Mets extraordinary rotation, and the recent resurgence of Matt Harvey, will keep them in contention. Upgrading the offense is tricky now, for many reasons: Few impact hitters are available yet, Alderson said, and the team is still assessing its needs.At least Wrights status seems likely to be resolved soon. He has been in limbo since his last game on May 27. Wright is in Los Angeles with a back specialist, and Alderson said the team would know by the end of this week whether to proceed with conservative rehabilitation for his herniated disk or opt for surgery.One third baseman became available Monday when Major League Baseball declared Yulieski Gourriel a free agent. Gourriel, 32, was a star in Cuba who defected in February. Cautiously, Alderson indicated some level of interest.Our preference has always been to kind of diversify a little bit and spread our risk, and thats typically not possible in the Cuban market, he said. But were taking a look at that situation, and well look at that market in the future.The Mets will clearly explore the trade market for splashier acquisitions than they have already made. Acquiring Yoenis Cespedes from Detroit last summer cost the Mets pitcher Michael Fulmer, who has been dominant for the Tigers. The Mets farm system is not as deep now, but they hope they have enough.Will we be as aggressive? I dont know the answer to that at this point, Alderson said. Are we able to be as aggressive? I still think we have the prospects, if necessary, in our system to move, and from a financial standpoint I think we also have what is necessary. Well just have to see what happens late in July.The path to get there could be more daunting, though: Even at their lowest point last season, the Mets never trailed the Nationals by more games than they do now."}
{"text": "If you read a lot of books to children, you may come up against the syndrome I call story fatigue: when a child who ordinarily likes a good story becomes sick of hearing about imaginary characters and their made-up scenarios. Or you may know a child with what seems like congenital story fatigue, who likes stories fine but always perks up around anything factual.For these cases especially, its a thrill to come across the kind of picture book that seamlessly integrates actual worldly knowledge with the imaginative leaps and empathetic journey good fiction provides.The author-illustrator Hudson Talbott (River of Dreams, Its All About Me-Ow) writes nonfiction picture books with narrative flair. In his latest, From Wolf to Woof!, he toggles gracefully between the real and the fictional as he explains how modern dogs evolved from wolves and why dogs, more than any other type of animal, are so closely integrated into day-to-day human life.We begin long ago when there were no dogs, only  as we see in an arresting two-page spread of furry beasts leaping forward against a white background, fangs bared, yellow eyes glinting  wolves. Talbotts concisely delivered information (A wolf pack is a family group that works as a team to hunt and care for their young) shades right into a tale: There was once an orphaned wolf pup who tagged along behind a pack .This pup eventually encounters his human counterpart, an orphaned boy out scavenging, and a friendship grows based on mutual usefulness  the boy throws the wolf pup a bone to make him stop howling. The pup comes back for more. The game of fetch is born, and soon they are a great team, hunting and playing together. A tribe of outcasts is formed, canine and human, with clear mutual advantages.Thousands of years later, were told, wolves are becoming  dogs! as we see in another two-page spread of rather gentler-looking leaping beasts, members of the dog breeds we know and love today. The book concludes with a celebration of work dogs rescuing, comforting and guiding, and a shout-out to the remaining wild wolves, who need our help if they are to survive. Talbotts nimble, sweet art pulls everything together so beautifully, its hard to imagine the child  story-lover or fact-lover, dog-lover or not  who would not be drawn in by this book.What Talbott is giving his young readers is not just the facts about where dogs came from. He notes in an afterword that the book is also an origin myth for modern dogs, and he has provided a marvelous demonstration of that most ancient of techniques that blends the factual and the fictional to arrive at a kind of deep knowledge.Babak the Beetle is much sneakier about getting facts into its story. This clever book, written by the prolific French childrens author Fred Paronuzzi, intends mainly to make its readers laugh  to deliver the satisfaction of being in on the joke. In that it succeeds absolutely, and Andre Prigents stylish and witty, modern-looking illustrations only add to the books delight. Its about Babak, an earnest dung beetle, who one day discovers a strange, pocked egg and is determined to finds its parents:Obviously, an egg needs to be sat on! As he goes around querying his animal friends, we learn interesting stuff about eggs, such as a cuckoo doesnt sit on its own eggs but puts them in the nests of other birds, and a frog lays thousands of transparent eggs (Babak is very impressed  but also a little sickened because they looked like jelly eyes). Its Mrs. Snake who clues him in on the eggs owners  she says she once ate one of the eggs and never did digest it. She points him to a place where there are heaps of eggs like Babaks, and to his horror, the parents of the eggs, armed with long sticks, were hitting the eggs and sending them off, flying through the air!Why didnt I see that one coming from the start? This is the first of Paronuzzis books to be translated into English, and Ill be looking out for more."}
{"text": "Some of Junes gay pride celebrations happened last weekend, but many are still ahead. The one in Louisville, Ky., is among them. Theres a parade scheduled for Friday.Thats your state, Mitch McConnell. You should go.If youre not comfortable marching, mingle on the sidelines. If parades arent your thing, make an appearance at one of the other pride events in Kentucky in coming days.Just show up. And by doing so, show that the absence of gay or L.G.B.T. in your statements immediately following the Orlando massacre  and in the statements of so many other prominent Republicans  isnt because you place us and our concerns behind some thick pane of glass with a Do Not Touch sign that stays up even when blood and tears pool beneath it.For more than 48 hours, Paul Ryan also seemed to avoid any mention of the kind of nightclub that the Orlando gunman chose and one of the reasons its revelers were marked for death.On Tuesday morning that silence finally ended, as Ryan told journalists in Washington that he wanted to be clear.Members of the L.G.B.T. community were the targets, he said. They were simply attacked for who they are.He thus joined his 2012 running mate, Mitt Romney, who sent out a tweet midday Monday offering a special prayer for the L.G.B.T. community that was the focus of this attack.Ryan also joined Donald Trump, who mentioned L.G.B.T. Americans repeatedly in his formal remarks on Monday afternoon, expressing solidarity with the members of Orlandos L.G.B.T. community and asserting that the gunman wanted to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.But more conspicuous than what Romney and Trump said was what so many other Republicans didnt.Bemoaning the carnage, they justly condemned the Islamic State and violent extremists. They rightly paid tribute to first responders.But this specificity didnt extend to the lives and loves of the people killed. Even Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, initially sidestepped the subject, failing to emphasize that many of them spent their final terrified minutes in a place where they had sought precisely the comfort and belonging that they didnt always feel on the other side of its walls.We still have much to learn about the exact mix of the gunmans motives. There are reports that he cased other locations. His unhinged diatribes apparently extended to women, blacks and Jews as well as gays.His past behavior and his call to 911 demonstrated an overarching hatred of America, with its celebration of diversity and individual liberty. The revelers in Pulse epitomized that liberty, and what happened to them is part of a bigger story and a bigger struggle that affect all Americans.But that doesnt preclude an acknowledgment of their sexual orientations, and it doesnt excuse any reluctance to discuss that.Roman Catholic leaders, too, shied away. Statements by the bishop of Orlando and by the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said nothing about a gay nightclub or gays.Such omissions so troubled the Rev. James Martin, a best-selling Jesuit author, that he posted a video commentary about them on Facebook on Monday afternoon. Twenty-four hours later, it had been viewed about 700,000 times.If the murders had happened, God forbid, in a church of a particular Christian denomination, Catholic leaders would decry the murders and then naturally express their solidarity with members of that denomination, he said in the video, adding that for the most part, this was not done for the grieving L.G.B.T. community.He told me on Tuesday that there were exceptions, including Bishop Robert Lynch of St. Petersburg, Fla., who wrote a blog post in which he conceded that religion, including Catholicism, often breeds contempt for gays, lesbians and transgender people, and that this contempt can lead to violence. Lynch stressed that the Orlando victims were all made in the image and likeness of God.We teach that, Lynch wrote. We should believe that. We must stand for that.We includes leaders of both parties. If Ted Cruz can mourn Orlando as an attack on gay people  which, in fact, he did  then every other Republican can, too.This is one of those moments, in the wake of terror, when we find the most apt and evocative ways to underscore our oneness and renounce our fear. When we make grand gestures. When we make pointed ones.So Majority Leader McConnell, pick your rally. Speaker Ryan, accompany him. Governor Scott, attend the funerals of gay victims. Other Republicans and Democrats, recognize L.G.B.T. Americans with both your words and your presence at gay pride celebrations.You want to show our enemies what America stands for? Then stand with us."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump has repeatedly promised a pivot toward a softer, gentler, more refined version of his candidacy since he emerged as the presumptive Republican nominee. But on Monday, Mr. Trumps television interviews and speeches made clear that such a pivot would never come.In four morning interviews, Mr. Trump stood by his ban on Muslim immigrants and said that President Obama was incompetent or knew much more than he was letting on about the type of terrorist threat the country faces. That statement, which Mr. Trump declined to completely clarify in a statement to Bloomberg Politics late in the day, was taken by some as implying that Mr. Obama, whose critics have tried to smear him as a Muslim in disguise, was sympathetic to terrorists.Later in the day, in a speech in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump expanded on his proposed immigration ban and also called for large-scale surveillance of activities of Muslims in the country.The speech was a stark contrast to one delivered shortly before by Hillary Clinton, who made no direct mention of Mr. Trump and urged the type of conciliatory notes that the nation struck immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. She made a muscular defense argument, similar to the one Mr. Trump struck, but she proposed a more globalist view of the world than he did.Mr. Trump is making a bet that a nation terrified of another attack like the one at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., over the weekend will be open to proposals that are fundamentally different from anything any major-party nominee has recommended in modern history. That bet will not be clear until closer to Election Day."}
{"text": "Richard Selzer, a surgeon who turned his operating-room experiences into fictional stories that blended the gore, the beauty and the absurdity of modern medicine, died on Wednesday in North Branford, Conn. He was 87.His wife, Janet, confirmed his death.Dr. Selzers lofty, old-fashioned style infused short stories, essays and memoir. His 1991 New York Times Magazine piece, A Question of Mercy, about an AIDS patient requesting assisted suicide, inspired a play of the same title by David Rabe, the Tony Award-winning playwright and screenwriter.Dr. Selzer gave up medicine and turned to writing full time when he was 58.I noticed my dexterity was decreasing, he told The Yale Daily News in 2011, and I didnt want to hurt anyone, and I also had wanted to become a writer. So I said, Im going to stop. He said that when he started writing fiction, in his 40s, he wanted to write medically based stories that could only have been written by a doctor or surgeon, and yet it would tell a story of human interest. They were often based on his experiences, but with imaginative twists.One of his best-known stories, Imelda, tells of a plastic surgeon who, after his 4-year-old patient dies, fixes her cleft lip so she will look prettier at the wake. That happened, he said, sort of.He once said, I believe, and I hope it doesnt sound immodest, that I am the first one of my kind; that there were no other doctors or surgeons who wrote the kind of things that Ive been doing.Jerome Groopman, a Harvard professor of medicine and a staff writer for The New Yorker, endorsed that notion, writing in The New York Times that Dr. Selzer helped usher in the genre of medical writing in which the physician puts his experiences under the microscope for the lay readers scrutiny.Dr. Selzer delighted in the language of medicine as much as the practice of it. His stories were seasoned with multisyllabic medical terms (necrosis, enucleation, cyanosis) as well as words that have different connotations when used by doctors than when used by patients.In his short story Whither Thou Goest, a doctor asks the wife of a brain-dead patient if she would consent to harvesting her husbands organs for transplantation. Harvest? said Hannah, like the gathering of wheat? If Dr. Selzer could not find the word he wanted in the dictionary, he made it up. In an introduction to an anthology of his writing, Marie Borroff, the Sterling professor of English emerita at Yale, pointed to a few of her favorite Selzerisms, among them canimosity, for a dislike of dogs, and aqualune, to describe the path of moonlight in water.I think my writing is antique, Dr. Selzer said, of the past, not of modern tongue. The imagery is baroque, full of metaphors and similes. Its my way, and I couldnt do it any other way.With his high-pitched, airy voice, he would give readings at universities, often to medical students, encouraging many of them to try writing fiction. He admitted that even his nonfiction often stretched the truth.Im a liar, but it makes a good story, he said on more than one occasion. For instance, in a talk at Yale in the 1980s, he said, falsely, that medical students in his creative writing course didnt know the difference between prostrate and prostate. He said later that the line always drew a laugh.His books include The Doctor Stories, Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery, Confessions of a Knife, Rituals of Surgery and Letters to a Young Doctor.Allen Richard Selzer was born on June 24, 1928, in Troy, N.Y., the second son of Julius Louis Selzer, a general practitioner, and the former Gertrude Schneider, a singer who performed in local musicals and operas.He graduated from Union College in 1948 and Albany Medical College in 1953. After an internship at Yale, he was drafted into the Army and served as lieutenant in Korea from 1955 to 1957. He finished his surgical residency at Yale in 1957 and practiced until 1985, when he left his medical career to write full time.Besides his wife of 61 years, his survivors include a daughter, Gretchen Lehman; two sons, Larry and Jonathan; and seven grandchildren. He lived in North Branford.Dr. Selzers first stabs at fiction were horror stories, published in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.I came by the horror naturally, Dr. Selzer once said. Surgery is the one branch of medicine that is the most violent. After all, its violent to take up a knife and cut open a persons body and rummage around with your hands. I think I was attracted to the horrific.He was an artist in residence at Yaddo, the artists colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 10 times and a resident scholar at the Rockefeller Foundations Bellagio Study Center on Lake Como in Italy. (He left Bellagio after one week to move into a monastery, which he found more conducive to writing.)Dr. Selzer received fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1985 and the National Endowments for the Arts in 1988.I just want to be cremated and blow in the wind, Dr. Selzer said in an interview for this obituary. However, his wife quickly reminded him, he had already promised to donate his body to Yale."}
{"text": "GENEVA  A Russian diplomat at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva has been accused of sending a threatening message on Twitter to a member of a human rights organization that supports activists in Russia, according to rights activists.The intimidating message was sent in March to Florian Irminger, the head of advocacy for the Human Rights House Network. It showed an image of a flayed and bloody body from the popular television show Game of Thrones and said, Our blades are sharp.The Council president, Choi Kyong-lim of South Korea, denounced the message as completely unacceptable, and told the Council during its opening session on Monday that he had taken up the issue with the head of an unnamed mission.An investigation traced the message to a diplomat seated at Russias place in the Council during a discussion of a resolution promoting the protection of human rights defenders, Mr. Irminger said.We dont think theres a physical threat here, he said, but it has symbolic importance because this is how Russia acts with people who dissent. The real target is people who do human rights work in Russia.I want to know if this is Russian policy or not, Mr. Irminger added.The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said its Geneva mission had examined the episode and dismissed the message as basically a joke, albeit an unfortunate one. The message had ended with a smile and used a widely circulated image, the ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said.We believe its unacceptable to threaten civil society. This incident doesnt deserve the importance that is being artificially attached to it, she said.The director of the International Service for Human Rights, Phil Lynch, told the Council on Tuesday, an online threat made by a state representative, albeit one hiding behind the cowardice of anonymity, is a threat against both the targeted individual, Florian Irminger, and the integrity of this important institution.Though he did not name the country involved, Mr. Choi, the Council president, said the countrys ambassador had acknowledged that the member of the delegation committed this extremely regrettable act but not in his professional capacity and without the intention of it being a threat. He said the ambassador had issued an administrative reprimand to the diplomat concerned.Activists from China, Sri Lanka, Bahrain and other countries have faced intimidation, sometimes inside the United Nations, but officials said they could not recall such brazen harassment by a diplomat in the Council.Rights groups said the episode was an example of a pattern of intimidation and likened the threat to the tactics they say repressive governments use regularly against defenders of human rights.Human rights groups have called on Russia to take responsibility by publicly acknowledging the diplomats action, apologizing for his message and specifying how he would be sanctioned.Instead, the rights groups said, the diplomat had taken his place with the Russian delegation at the Councils session on Monday.Thats a slap in the face of the institution; its saying we dont care, Mr. Irminger said."}
{"text": "After combining for 82 points Monday night in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers sat down to answer questions from members of the news media and seemed relaxed for the first time since James returned to Cleveland. They joked with each other, bantered with reporters and made the drama of the last few days seem like a distant memory.Of course, it is easy to be relaxed after stealing a road victory over the 73-win Golden State Warriors in one of the most hostile environments in professional basketball while also becoming the first teammates in N.B.A. finals history to score 40 or more points in the same game.You tip your hat to them, Stephen Curry said after the game. They had a great night.It would be difficult to decide which player was more effective. James had a line of 41 points, 16 rebounds and 7 assists. Irving also had 41 points  on only 24 field-goal attempts  and seemed to bury the Warriors with crucial shots each time the game grew close.James was effusive in praising Irvings performance.Just calm, James said of Irvings demeanor. Just calm for 48 minutes. Obviously, he played 40 minutes, but even in the eight minutes that he was sitting down, he was just calm. Timely bucket after bucket that led our team.Some will try to put an asterisk on the performance by the Cleveland stars because of the absence of Draymond Green, Golden States most important defensive player, but throughout the game, a Warriors team known for its depth could not come up with an effective solution to slow James or Irving. They were a combined 9 for 15 from 3-point range and seemed just as adept at getting to the hoop for easier baskets or setting up their teammates when the coverage tightened. The two scored or assisted on 97 of Clevelands 112 points, while the entire Golden State lineup combined to score 97.There was a great deal of discussion about Jamess and Irvings dual 40-point games. The feat had been accomplished four times previously in the playoffs, but not in the finals. In fact, it is rare for teammates to have even 35 or more in a finals game. That has occurred only three other times since 1964, according to Basketball-Reference.com. The last pair to do it were Shaquille ONeal and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 3 of the 2002 finals against the Nets.The most famous of those games is Game 6 of the 1980 finals, when Magic Johnson, a point guard, filled in at center for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and contributed 40 points and 15 rebounds in a series-clinching win over the Philadelphia 76ers. Jamaal Wilkess 37-point effort in the win was relegated to a footnote.The combined 82 points by James and Irving put them third on the list for scoring by a duo in a finals game. The top spot belongs to Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, who had 87 points (Baylor had 61) in Game 5 of the 1962 finals. Of the 17 pairs to combine for 70 or more points in a finals game since 1964, West has been a part of seven of them.The second-highest combined total is from a different golden era for the Warriors, with Rick Barry and Jim King combining for 83 points  Barry had 55  in Game 3 of the 1967 finals.The Cavaliers will have to hope they can break a trend, as both the 1962 Lakers and the 1967 Warriors went on to lose the finals.Well, were in the same place we were last year, up, 3-2, heading back to Cleveland. If you told me this before the series, I would have taken it. So were in a good spot.Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach.  Golden State will travel to Cleveland for Game 6 on Thursday. None of the 32 teams to take a 3-to-1 series lead in a best-of-seven finals have failed to win the championship."}
{"text": "Update, April 27, 2017: Since this article was published in June 2016, the military policy bill was restructured and the language requiring women to register for selective service was removed. The bill passed with language calling for a review of the current rules. Read more in our fact check of viral claims to the contrary.WASHINGTON  In the latest and perhaps decisive battle over the role of women in the military, Congress is embroiled in an increasingly intense debate over whether they should have to register for the draft when they turn 18.On Tuesday, the Senate approved an expansive military policy bill that would for the first time require young women to register for the draft. The shift, while fiercely opposed by some conservative lawmakers and interest groups, had surprisingly broad support among Republican leaders and women in both parties.The United States has not used the draft since 1973 during the Vietnam War. But the impact of such a shift, reflecting the evolving role of women in the armed services, would likely be profound.Under the Senate bill passed on Tuesday, women turning 18 on or after Jan. 1, 2018, would be forced to register for Selective Service, as men must do now. Failure to register could result in the loss of various forms of federal aid, including Pell grants, a penalty that men already face. Because the policy would not apply to women who turned 18 before 2018, it would not affect current aid arrangements.The fact is, said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, every single leader in this country, both men and women, members of the military leadership, believe that its fair since we opened up all aspects of the military to women that they would also be registering for Selective Services.The Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that women did not have to register for the draft, noting that they should not face the same requirements as men because they did not participate on the front lines of combat. But since Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in December that the Pentagon would open all combat jobs to women, military officials have told Congress that women should also sign up for the draft.Its my personal view, Gen. Robert B. Neller, the commandant of the Marine Corps, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, that with the complete lifting of the ban on women in combat roles, every American whos physically qualified should register for the draft.While most Republican senators  including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and the women on the Armed Services Committee  agree with the move, it has come under fierce attack from some of Congresss most conservative members.The idea that we should forcibly conscript young girls in combat to my mind makes little sense at all, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the father of two young daughters, said on the Senate floor last week.After voting against the bill on Tuesday, Mr. Cruz said in a prepared statement: I could not in good conscience vote to draft our daughters into the military, sending them off to war and forcing them into combat.The debate will now pit the Senate against the House, where the policy change has support but was not included in that chambers version of the bill.In April, Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, offered a provision related to women and the draft for the House version of the defense policy bill to highlight the issue, even though he opposes the idea  then voted against his own amendment. It passed with bipartisan support but was stripped from the final bill in a procedural move.If he didnt do this in the committee and spur the national debate, who was going to do it? Joe Kasper, Mr. Hunters chief of staff, said. So, mission accomplished.Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, made a mild attempt to strip the language from the Senate bill on the floor after the Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly rejected a similar effort, but his amendment never received a vote.The two bills will now be reconciled in a conference committee between the House and the Senate, where a contentious debate is expected.It may well be a topic of great controversy, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who serves on the Armed Services Committee. But it should not be.Military experts say that even if the efforts to compel women to enlist fails in Congress, the issue is not going away.I think the change is inevitable, said Nora Bensahel, a military policy analyst at American Universitys School of International Service, whether in this debate or through the courts. It just seems that now that you have women allowed to serve in any position in the military, there is no logical basis to say women should not be drafted.Conservative groups, which threatened to target senators who voted for the policy bill, reacted with anger on Tuesday to the bills passage. Allowing our daughters to be forced into combat if there is a draft is a clear example of Washington placing more value on liberal social engineering than military objectives and preparedness, one such group, Heritage Action for America, said in a news release.But supporters of the policy change say opponents are oversimplifying the issue. What people dont seem to understand is just because there is conscription, that does not mean that all women would serve in the infantry, Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, said. There are many ways to serve our country in the event of a national emergency.The Senate is expected to hold its ground as conservative members defend the status quo. Mr. McCain, whose family has a long and storied history in the military and whose daughter-in-law is a captain in the Air Force Reserve, said to Mr. Cruz on the Senate floor: I respect the senator from Texass view. Too bad that view is not shared by our military leadership, the ones who have had the experience in combat with women."}
{"text": "ALBANY  Housing advocates are frustrated and ethics watchdogs are positively morose. But lawmakers here have made at least one demographic happy this week: the mimosa set.With precious little time remaining for the legislative session, which is to end on Thursday, the antepenultimate day in Albany was marked by the usual closed-door negotiations among Democrats, who run the State Assembly, and Republicans, who rule the State Senate.Among the major issues still hanging in the balance were proposals to hem in the corrupting influence of money in elections, a proposal that could encourage more affordable housing and a bill to address the threat of climate change.In the meantime, however, there was the issue of brunch.In a joint agreement between the Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  announced on Tuesday just after the breakfast shift, but before the lunch rush  the state will allow restaurants and bars to start serving drinks on Sundays at 10 a.m.Establishments with liquor licenses outside New York City will be allowed to apply for up to 12 special permits a year for even earlier sales, beginning at 8 a.m.  perfect for international soccer matches and unexpected visits from your in-laws.The Alcohol Beverage Control Law, which dates to the Great Depression, had made thirsty diners and dipsomaniacs wait until noon.In a statement, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, cast the deal as a blow against this states archaic blue laws and part of a larger, more long-term policy of his administration to support New Yorks alcohol industry, which he said created some of the best beer, wine, cider and distilled spirits in the world.The first call for alcohol, which was packaged along with a range of other changes to the law, came as a peculiar bookend to an agreement on how to deal with another addictive substance: heroin.The drug, which has rapidly spread across the country in recent years, was the subject of a large package of programs and policies outlined on Tuesday, including easing access to treatment, expanding wraparound recovery services and limiting opioid prescriptions for acute pain to seven days, with some exceptions.State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and majority leader, whose party has been aggressive in response to the heroin crisis, said the plan would bring hope to communities battling opioid abuse throughout New York.Hope, however, was fading elsewhere. If any part of the legislative session seemed bound to disappoint, it was the failure thus far to pass major ethics reforms, despite the recent corruption convictions and sentencings of two former legislative leaders: Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos.The inertia has deeply frustrated government watchdog groups who have repeatedly gathered in the Capitol to push for anticorruption measures, and did so again on Tuesday. Their priorities: closing the campaign finance loophole that allows limited liability companies to donate like individuals, rather than businesses; limiting legislators ability to earn money for jobs held outside the Legislature; and making the state budget process more transparent.But the two reforms that Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature have discussed  stripping pensions from legislators convicted of felonies and limiting the reach of independent expenditure groups  amount to little more than a distraction from the real issues, the watchdogs said.One advocate, Barbara Bartoletti, the legislative director of the League of Women Voters, appeared ready to concede defeat for now, leaving it to the voters to demand change during the fall elections and make sure some of these people dont come back next January.Other issues seemed increasingly likely to be pushed to next year, such as ride-sharing  its backers were pessimistic they would get a deal to allow an upstate expansion  and the tax break and development program known as 421-a, which was the subject of some last-minute negotiations with little progress. The issue of when and how long mayoral control of New York Citys schools would be extended was also still a mystery.Daily fantasy sports, meanwhile, seemed to be pushing hard for a deal to become legal in the state, complete with paid appearances from the former National Football League quarterback stars Vinny Testaverde and Jim Kelly.And while the session has had little in the way of recent excitement, the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, said much could happen between now and the Thursday deadline.Weve still got two days, he said."}
{"text": "Im almost always the one who gets the chicken.For review meals, I try to let my guests choose their own food. Then I pick something nobody else wants. Often, this is the chicken. I think this can be explained by a remark a friend made recently. I never eat chicken in restaurants, he said. I can make chicken at home.So can I, but every time I go to a new restaurant, I hope the kitchen may know things about poultry that I dont. Every once in a while, Im right.At Le Coq Rico, a three-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street, I was right. In fact, I think I have finally found the perfect restaurant to take people who think they can make a better chicken at home.Wed ordered an old New England breed of chicken called Plymouth Rock for $95, along with a guinea fowl that cost a dollar more. Carved and fit back together, each bird was placed in the center of the table in its own iron roasting pan. Our eyes locked in on the bronzed skin and tapering curves of drumsticks with fixed and purposeful stares that, if we had not been humans looking at poultry, I would call lust.The meat had all the things I wanted and none of the things I didnt. It was moist but not drippy or briny; compact and muscular but not tough; long on deep, rounded flavor that didnt seem to rely on salt or sugar.Some of my guests preferred the chicken, calling the guinea fowl sinewy. It was a bit stringy at the joints, but once disentangled, the flesh had a flavor I found highly persuasive. Even the white meat tasted like dark meat.The menu suggested that one bird would feed up to four people. We nearly demolished twice as many, along with a macaroni gratin and a bundle of stout, dark fries that we dunked into a small pitcher of jus. After we were too full to go on, we noticed an untouched chicken leg. One of my guests ate that, too, down to the bone.True, he did it on a bet. But I suspect he would have done it for nothing.The chef and owner is Antoine Westermann. His distillations of the cuisine of his native Alsace at Le Buerehiesel in Strasbourg were widely praised before he handed it over to his son and moved to Paris. One of the places Mr. Westermann opened there is the original Coq Rico, a theme restaurant of sorts. Poultry (eggs, organs, broth) turns up in almost everything the kitchen makes, most spectacularly in the whole chickens that are first braised in chicken stock and then threaded on to a rotisserie.He gave Le Coq Rico a subtitle that is both irresistible and accurate: The Bistro of Beautiful Birds.By March, when he opened a Manhattan branch a few doors down from Gramercy Tavern, he had spent several months scouting for beautiful American birds. Mr. Westermann is particular about how long they spend pecking and strutting before they land on his rotisserie. The menu lists the age at slaughter  our server seemed to prefer harvest  for each breed on the menu, from 90 days for the Plymouth Rock to 130 days for the guinea fowl.The industry standard is 40 days, the server said, apparently used to fielding questions about these numbers. (Two more chicken breeds listed on the menu, New Hampshire and Cornish, werent available when I went; they are still enjoying country living.)A whole Brune Landaise (110 days), a French breed with milder flavor than the Plymouth Rock, is simmered in a clay casserole with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, artichokes, stock and a bottle of riesling. This, Mr. Westermanns version of an Alsatian baeckeoffe, was terrific, with bewitching undercurrents of spice in a sauce that had body but no visible fat. The price, though, $120, made me queasy.A roasted quarter of the same breed, for $24, is Le Coq Ricos offering for the solo chicken eater. The half-breast and thigh I tried were moist and flavorful but slightly inert, as if warmed over. If I came back alone, maybe to sit at the counter facing the kitchen in a narrow alley off the main dining room, Id want the squab. Unwrapping the cabbage leaf around it, cutting into the handsomely roasted bird surrounded by foie gras stuffing, and dipping slices of excellent house-baked baguette into the glossy dark sauce is a sure route to Francophilia.Shopping for chickens, Mr. Westermann found eggs. Some go into Matthieu Simons desserts, one of which is awe-inspiring: the floating island, a single grapefruit-size ball of meringue with a crackling sugar glaze on top, resting in a pond of crme anglaise. The rhubarb souffl is another good, if more routine, showpiece for egg whites. Id choose either over the double-wide raspberry mille-feuille whose puff pastry wasnt crisp enough to shatter.A Coq Rico meal could start with eggs, too  or, as the menu calls this group of appetizers, Eggz. Its rare to find oeuf en meurette, in all its rich, spoon-coating, lardon-studded glory, made this well in Manhattan.Served with a heap of mche and spicy pink hummus, sauted chicken livers were glorious, combining the rich creaminess of a soft cheese with the metallic tang of organ meat. I expected great things from the chicken gizzards served with artichokes  la Barigoule, too, but their flavor seemed to have leaked out somewhere.From his days at Le Buerehiesel, Mr. Westermann has brought along the recipe for foie gras terrine baked inside a soft pastry crust. Im not convinced this single slice of terrine is worth $32, but I dont know anywhere in New York to get a better, cheaper version, either.The architect Pascal Desprez has slotted Le Coq Rico into a somewhat awkward U-shaped space. By the entrance is a bar where the cocktail menu promises, somewhat menacingly, the dark side of Le Coq Rico.There always seemed to be mild confusion at the host podium, and each time I was led to my seat, I was afraid Id be deposited at one of the tables crammed into the narrow passageway. This hall opens in the back into a stylishly monochromatic dining room.Unless you have been to the Paris original, also designed by Mr. Desprez, the only things about the atmosphere that will strike you as French may be the peculiar pop music and, on some nights, Mr. Westermann himself, with wire-framed glasses on a head full of thoughts about chicken."}
{"text": "The bad reputation of theme park food has been, lets face it, pretty well deserved: All the negative aspects you might find at a state fair  sugary, greasy and overpriced  minus any of the quirky homespun charm. Mass-produced and joylessly prone to corporate tie-ins, its the ultimate iteration of the theme parks overriding mission: to separate you from every last dollar in your pocket.But theres good news on theme park menus. While the old standbys are still standing by, theres been a shift recently toward food thats actually, well, edible. Your old favorites are still there: funnel cakes, cotton candy, turkey legs. But there are some decent restaurants now, too, some of which border on the downright respectable. I sampled a bit of everything on an impulsive three-park tour that included Knotts Berry Farm and Universal Studios in Southern California, as well as Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Here are some rides worth sending your taste buds on.Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park owes its success directly to the boysenberry, a hybrid berry that would soon become the familys calling card. Walter Knott began propagating the berry and his wife began selling chicken dinners on the property of their modest farm. By the 1940s the dinners had become so popular that Knott created a small Old West town to entertain waiting diners and voil  what they call Americas first theme park was born.Well start with the bad news: Many of the vendors at Knotts sell rehashed variations of the same combinations  burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich, fries  despite having enticing names or being situated in different themed areas in the park. For example: I ordered a Western BBQ bacon burger ($8.79  la carte, $15.99 in a combo with fries and drink) at Sutters Fine Family Fare in Ghost Town. It had an unappetizingly stringy texture, and didnt make up for that in flavor.So I moved on, walking through Camp Snoopy over to the Grizzly Creek Lodge. It was a nice space with a large dining room, and I was excited. But the menu was almost identical: burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich. As was the menu at Coasters Diner. At Boardwalk Barbecue there wasnt a barbecue item anywhere on the menu. No matter where I went, it was just the same burger, hot dog and chicken sandwich. (To be fair, sometimes theres a pizza, and sometimes chicken tenders. But its all more or less the same menu.)It wasnt all bad  I had some good carne asada nachos ($10.59) from Cantina in Fiesta Village. The guacamole that topped them was flavorless, but the meat was great. It was hot and tender and had a peppery quality almost like jerky. I also managed to find some actual barbecue at Firemans Brigade Barbecue. Despite the disgruntled employee manning the grill who was cursing sotto voce while cooking the ribs, turkey, corn and garlic toast that I ordered, the food was decent. The giant turkey leg ($10.29), in particular, was the best I sampled at all three parks if only because it was the only example that wasnt overwhelmingly salty.The good news is that Mrs. Knotts Chicken Dinner Restaurant, which closed last year for renovations, is open again, and its well worth your time. The best part? You dont even have to pay for park admission ($47 online, by far the cheapest of the parks I visited) to go; the restaurant is right outside the gates of the park. Service is good (I sat at the bar), and the dcor is appealing, if trying a little too hard: wooden tables, lighting fixtures made with old ladders and Mason jars. Lets call it modern barn.I had a traditional fried chicken dinner for $21.99 that included four pieces of fried chicken, a small dish of mouth-puckering cherry-flavored rhubarb, cabbage with ham, six buttermilk biscuits, mashed potatoes with gravy, and a slice of boysenberry pie. Its an absurd amount of food for the price, and most of it was quite good. The chicken was hot and juicy; the biscuits were warm and buttery. Theres also a shop next door called Chicken To-Go where you can get many of the menu items for takeout, as well as large chicken buckets (22 pieces with sides for $50.59) for parties.When I flew into Knoxville, Tenn., and picked up my car from the rental kiosk, Paula behind the desk asked me what I was doing in town. I told her I was there to go to Dollywood. You came all the way from Los Angeles to go to  Dollywood? she said with a disbelieving stare. I nodded. Well, you should go see my boyfriend. He works there. He can give you recommendations.Maybe, as a local, she had become slightly immune to its charms. But I found the 150-acre park pretty delightful. Dollywood, founded in 1961 as Rebel Railroad, has a very light, Up With People kind of vibe. The music is bouncy and cheerful, and the employees positively exude classic Southern charm, down to the parking lot tram driver, who called out after us, I hope you make memories worth repeating, and I hope you love every moment.I dont know about memories worth repeating, but I definitely found food worth re-eating. Dollywood excels, as one might expect, in traditional Southern fare. The wonderfully titled Granny Ogles Ham & Beans is named after the grandmother of one of Dolly Partons close friends. I ordered the Fronies Sampler for $15.99, which came with pot roast, pulled ham, mashed potatoes, turnip greens and a blackberry cobbler. The meats were very good  not overcooked but still very tender in their own juices.I managed to find Paulas boyfriend, Reid, working at a small gift kiosk and asked where he thought I should eat. Personally, I think Backstage has the best food in the park, he said. Get the fried green tomatoes. The Backstage restaurant tries to recreate the look and feel behind the proscenium at a place like the Grand Ole Opry House or Ryman Auditorium. There are lots of old knickknacks, chests, ropes, lights and doors marked Prop Master. I sat down at a table and ordered the Coca-Cola-infused ribs, along with some fried green tomatoes and a banana pudding for dessert.The ribs ($18.99) were solid but unspectacular  a bit dry, and the Coca-Cola marinade gave them a confusing sweetness. The fried green tomatoes ($6.99) were better: generous slices perfectly fried in a cornmeal batter (which was a bit thick for my taste, but I picked some of it off). The banana pudding made me feel like an 8-year-old back at my babysitters house  sweet, creamy pudding with big chunks of banana, mixed with crumbled up Nilla wafers and topped with Cool Whip. I noticed the name tag of my nice waitress read Koke. My mama named me after a Coca-Cola bottle, she said. And when she went down to the courthouse, she spelled my dang name wrong!Other areas where Dollywood really shone were with the casual finger foods. The funnel cake ($6.99) was the best of the three parks I visited  crispy on the outside, hot and moist on the inside, with a generous dusting of powdered sugar. The cinnamon bread ($5.99) from a place called the Grist Mill was a loaf of sloppy decadence. About the size of my two fists together (an incredible bargain, by the way), the loaf, fresh out of the oven, almost burned my hands through the paper bag I received it in. The hot bread, dripping with a syrupy butter mixture, had a nice savory component to it as well, balancing out the sweetness.Lets cut to the chase: At Universal, its all about the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which opened last year to epic lines and mobs of robe-wearing, wand-wielding fans. It accomplishes an ambitious goal: to make you feel as if youve been transported to another place. The buildings are beautifully designed; the shops are carefully done with great attention paid to detail. A woman selling small stuffed animals called Pygmy Puffs rang a bell when a little girl bought one. Attention everyone, the employee said. Casey here is adopting a Pygmy Puff, and hes going to a wonderful home. Can I get a round of applause? People clapped, and the little girl positively beamed.Three Broomsticks is the main place to get grub, and its really the only one worth your time  and that applies to the entire park. (Exception: There are a couple of decent places in the Simpsons-themed area, including some very respectable $8.99 carnitas tacos from the Bumblebee Mans Taco Truck.) I was again impressed with the dcor: old lanterns and caldrons abound. (Members of the staff are all dressed like Dobby the house elf, though  I wasnt sure how I felt about that.) My dining companion and I made a couple of friends in line and decided to order the Great Feast for four people ($54.99). It was one of the best dining bargains of any of the three parks I visited, and I would go so far as to say that its objectively a good value  in or out of a theme park.You get an enormous fresh salad with Italian dressing that is easily enough food for six people. Thats followed by the main event, a gargantuan tray of food brought out by one of the cooks. Heres the Great Feast, she said, smiling, magically prepared for you guys. I asked her, Do they make you say that? She smiled even bigger. Yes, they do!On the tray were four big ears of corn, a mountain of roasted red potatoes with grilled onions, four slabs of ribs, a big roasted chicken and various steamed vegetables. The undercooked veggies were the only thing that was underwhelming. Everything else was excellent. The ribs were moist and juicy, the meat coming effortlessly off the bone. The roasted chicken was also tender, and flavored nicely with pepper, lemon and garlic. The potatoes were soft and savory, dripping with butter.The accompanying drinks were almost as good as the food itself: Butterbeer, the drink made famous in the novels, is creamy and indulgent. Its essentially cream soda topped with a thick layer of foam that resembles melted ice cream. The pumpkin juice is also tasty  refreshing and not overly sweet, its like a nice spiced apple juice.Wow, said our new friends, Amy and Kyle, through mouthfuls of chicken and ribs.

{"text": "LONDON  On Friday the worlds most popular modern art museum, the Tate Modern, opens a new 10-story wing designed by the Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. Called the Switch House, the extension will show off contemporary work, including film, installation and live performance, and will add 60 percent more space to the already enormous former power station on the banks of the Thames.Few anticipated when the Tate Modern opened in 2000 that it would transform both the idea of a museum and the nature of museum-going. Its director, Nicholas Serota, hoped for two million annual visitors. More than five million have passed through its doors each year. They have flocked to its gigantic Turbine Hall to watch a glowing sunrise from hundreds of tungsten lights in Olafur Eliassons The Weather Project, sifted Ai Weiweis hand-painted sunflower seeds through their fingers and heard actors telling intimate stories in Tino Sehgals These Associations, among many highlights.What will be in the new space? And what should you see first? Here is a users guide to planning your first trip.Navigating the Switch House The new extension adapts parts of the original power station that the 2000 renovation by Herzog & de Meuron didnt touch. Adjacent to this older layer is a pyramidal tower 212 feet tall, clad in perforated brick that the architects have described as looking like knitwear. You can enter from the huge Turbine Hall in the older building, passing through the subterranean Tanks, which once held a million gallons of oil to power the refinery.The rehabilitation of the Tanks was the first phase of the new building,  in 2012. They are dedicated to performance art and experimental film. A sculptural concrete staircase curves up to three levels of exhibition space. A bridge on Level 4 connects back to the older building (now called the Boiler House). Higher floors are devoted to education, offices and a members room. So after gorging on art, head for the new restaurant on Level 9, and, for dessert, savor the wraparound balcony on Level 10, with a 360-degree view of London.Thinking outside the cubeIt starts from the 1960s, when art became very active, said Catherine Wood, Tate Moderns senior curator, International Art (Performance). There was a lot of rethinking of sculpture, creating objects that could be manipulated, rearranged, walked through and also listened to. The idea is really to show the global scope of what the museum has acquired in the last 10 years, and the kinds of pieces that dont need or want a white cube space.At what cost? The new building cost 260 million pounds (about $370 million) from public and private funding, with the largest donation (50 million, or $71 million) from the British government.The new exhibitions In the East Tank and some adjacent spaces, look for light, sound, interactive sculpture and video works by original voices, including Marvin Gaye Chetwynd (video), Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (shadow art), Wen-Ying Tsai and Apichatpong Weerasethakul (film). In the South Tank is interactive sculpture by Robert Morris, Charlotte Posenenske and Rasheed Araeen. The South Tank is also the anchor point for live performance art. (More about that later.)Levels 2, 3 and 4 present individually themed exhibitions.On Level 2, Between Object and Architecture looks at the way post-1960s artists employed geometric shapes and ordinary building materials like bricks or cubes, and includes artists from Latin America and China as well as Europe, emphasizing the museums commitment to what Frances Morris, the director of the Tate Modern, called a more global story of art.Level 3 offers Performer and Participant  how artists began to engage audiences in participatory activities.On Level 4, in Living Cities, artists comment on their experiences in urban centers. Artist Rooms: Louise Bourgeois demonstrates a renewed interest in narrative themes. Minimalism denuded the artwork of its storytelling potential. The artists, from Bourgeois onward, started putting personal experience and gender identity back in, Ms. Morris said.What and where is live art?Live art, or performance-based work, has been a swelling current in the art world during the last decade, with roots in the 1960s. The Tate will showcase six pieces throughout the new and old buildings from Friday to July 3. In Tania Brugueras piece, mounted police will perform crowd control techniques on horseback.Whats new in the old part?In the Boiler House, the collection  from 1900 to the present  has been reorganized by theme rather than chronology, with an emphasis on an international perspective in art history. (You will still see works by Picasso, Gerard Richter or and Mark Rothko.)I think doing it in this way is novel and different from Paris or New York, and corresponds to the way artists think, Mr. Serota said.What the pros like bestMr. Serota: You cant visit the Tate without going to the Rothko Room (Level 2 of the Boiler House). Then look at a wonderful room of work by the German artist Rebecca Horn, on Level 3 of the Switch House. Next door, Ana Lupas, a Romanian artist who has been working from the mid-1960s, embalmed rural straw sculptures; its very striking. Then go up to the Louise Bourgeois room on Level 4, where you can see some of the most important work of her career, made in the last 10 years of her life.Ms. Wood: Take time to see some of the live performance in the South Tank. Walk up the fabulous staircase to Level 2 to see the sculpture display, then go to Level 4 and walk across the bridge that connects the two buildings, pausing to admire Ai Weiweis 22-foot sculpture created from parts of dead trees, in the Turbine Hall below. Travel by escalator back down to the hall and take part in David Lamelass interactive piece, Time.Ms. Morris: In the Boiler House, the new introductory Start gallery offers Matisses Snail. In the Studio features work by a great group of British artists: Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Bridget Riley. Then head to the Switch House, begin in the Tanks and walk up the staircase to the Between Object and Architecture exhibition. Finally, take the elevator to the 10th floor, look at the view of London and remind yourself that its the most cosmopolitan city in the world."}

{"text": "The terrorist attack that killed 49 and wounded 53 in Orlando, Fla., was the largest mass killing of gay people in American history, but before Sunday that grim distinction was held by a largely forgotten arson at a New Orleans bar in 1973 that killed 32 people at a time of pernicious anti-gay stigma.Churches refused to bury the victims remains. Their deaths were mostly ignored and sometimes mocked by politicians and the media. No one was ever charged. A joke made the rounds in workplaces and was repeated on the radio: Where will they bury the queers? In fruit jars!Outpourings of grief from politicians and everyday people have followed the Orlando shooting, but for those who remember the fire in the New Orleans bar, the UpStairs Lounge, its lonely memory has loomed large over conversations about the carnage this week at the Pulse nightclub.Mike Moreau, 72, who lost several friends in the fire, said he was struck by all the differences between then and now, but also by the familiarity of tragedys dull ache.What happened to us had to be kept so private, said Mr. Moreau. The public didnt want to know about it, and if they heard about it they didnt care  Thank God, theyre gone, they deserved it.To see the outpouring of love and support that these poor families have gotten is fantastic, he added about the Orlando massacre. They are hurting the same way we hurt, but at least they know that the world supports them and understands their grief.Mr. Moreau was with friends at a nearby bar on June 24, 1973, when an arsonist doused the stairs of the UpStairs Lounge with lighter fluid, set it aflame and rang the doorbell. When someone answered the door, a fireball burst into the room.One group of patrons fled out a back exit, but another was trapped across the room, caught between the flames and floor-to-ceiling windows fitted with metal bars. When firefighters extinguished the blaze, they found a pile of charred bodies, some embracing and others pressed against the windows.Congregants from the New Orleans chapter of the Metropolitan Community Church, an L.G.B.T.-affirming group, were meeting there after services. The Rev. Bill Larson was among the dead. His charred body was left slumped against the window bars in full view of passers-by for hours.He was one of many who died without ever coming out to their families, and his mother would not deal with his remains, said Robert L. Camina, who directed a documentary, UpStairs Inferno, about the blaze.His mother refused to collect his ashes because she was too embarrassed that she had a gay son, Mr. Camina said. And that is just one example. There are three people who were never identified at all. Why? Somebody has to miss them.Those three were buried in unmarked graves in a potters field along with a fourth person, Ferris LeBlanc, whose family did not know his fate until last year, Mr. Camina said.They dug a hole in the ground and put a bag in it and covered it back up, Mr. Moreau said.Public figures were unsupportive. The mayor, Moon Landrieu, did not cancel his vacation. Forty years later, a son of his, the current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, declared a day of public mourning for the fires victims on its anniversary.L.G.B.T. people have a place at the table now that they did not have then, said Clayton Delery-Edwards, who wrote a book about the arson that was published in 2014.The fire was an open wound for the gay community in New Orleans for years. No one was charged with the attack, and a man viewed by many as the primary suspect was never arrested. He committed suicide a year after the blaze.There was never any sense of justice, said Sebastian Rey, the president of the L.G.B.T. Community Center of New Orleans.Survivors had to deny any connection to the fire, including the loss of loved ones, because they could lose their jobs or apartments if bosses and landlords suspected they were gay. Mr. Rey said people who lived through that period did not talk about it for decades. As time passed, the tragedy became a rumor to new generations of L.G.B.T. people, he said.Johnny Townsend, who interviewed survivors in the late 80s and finally published their accounts in 2014, said the 40th anniversary commemoration gave it a kind of public attention it had not had before. People now feel more of a sense of their own history, he said.For Mr. Moreau, the outpouring of support for the victims in Orlando has been an uplifting sign of progress, he said.\"In Orlando, those poor people know at least that the whole world is behind them, he said. Nobody cared about us."}
{"text": "A THREE-BEDROOM VILLA WITH LAKE VIEWS NEAR SALZBURG$2.49 MILLION (2.2 MILLION EUROS)This villa, built in 2012, overlooks the small town of Mattsee and two lakes, Mattsee and Obertrumer, in upper Austria. Situated on a third of an acre, the property is about a seven-minute walk from the shore of Lake Mattsee. With a population of roughly 3,000, Mattsee is 12 miles outside the city of Salzburg.The 4,100-square-foot, three-level home features a glass elevator and geothermal heating, as well as programmable power switches and a high-tech alarm system.The lower level is divided by a central hallway, on one side of which is an apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen and a bath. This floor also has a sauna, wardrobe areas, a storage room, a wine cellar and access to the attached two-car garage.The ground floor, which has a separate entrance, is the main living area. It has an open floor plan, nearly 10-foot ceilings, a glass front wall, a fireplace and a large terrace with an automatic awning. The kitchen cabinets are by SieMatic. A thick marble slab tops the center island. The appliances include many extras, such as a steamer, a warming drawer and a wine refrigerator.The upper level has two large bedrooms, one full and one half bath, a library and two private terraces reached by sliding glass doors.The grounds include a landscaped garden and a heated swimming pool with a counter-current system for training.The home is well suited to people who are older or have disabilities, according to a spokesman for Marlies Muhr Real Estate in Salzburg, which has the listing, as no steps are required to enter from the driveway, and all floors may be reached by way of the elevator.Mattsees proximity to Salzburg makes it a popular recreation spot. The town of Mattsee, a two- or three-minute drive from the house, has a full array of shops and restaurants. Lake Mattsee has beaches and a sailing school and is ringed by a walking trail. Mattsee is also less than an hours drive from Austrias official lake district, the Salzkammergut, with numerous lakes, rolling hills and soaring mountains.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Austrian housing market is quite strong, with the total number of residential property sales last year up nearly 17 percent over the previous year, according to a May analysis by the Austrian National Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2015, sales prices rose nearly 8 percent over the same period in 2014.In Vienna, what had been robust price growth slowed to about 4 percent in the fourth quarter, but since 2010, prices in the capital city have risen by more than 50 percent, lately driven by sales of new condominiums, the report said. Outside Vienna, prices have increased by 30 percent during that period.The inventory of available homes on or near major lakes tends to be very limited. Most houses are owned by families and they pass from one generation to the next, said Linda Harpham, who works with Delta Immobilien, in Bad Ischl, a spa town in the Salzkammergut. That really stops the market moving. Supply is further limited by restrictions on new development.Properties directly on a lake  if you could get something at all  typically start at 750,000 euros to 1 million euros, or around $848,000 to $1.13 million, she said.WHO BUYS IN AUSTRIAForeign buyers are usually looking for either a holiday retreat or a place to retire, Ms. Harpham said. British buyers have traditionally made up the largest share of foreign buyers in Austrias lake areas. But over the last five years or so, those areas have begun to attract more Eastern European buyers, including Hungarians, Czechs and Russians, who view Austria very much as a safe haven, because of its stable home values, she said.The foreign buyer mix is even more diverse in super prime markets like Vienna, which is lately attracting more buyers from the Middle East, Switzerland, the United States and Hong Kong, according to Richard Buxbaum, the head of residential marketing for the Otto Immobilien Gruppe, a real estate firm based in Vienna.BUYING BASICSEach of Austrias nine Bundeslnder, or provinces, has different regulations governing what can be built and how it may be used. Buyers should be aware that not all properties may be used as holiday homes, but instead must be permanent residences. (This Mattsee property is currently used as a second home, and may continue to be, according to the Muhr agency.)There are additional restrictions on buyers from outside the European Union. These buyers must apply for a special permit from the Land Transfer Authorities granting them permission to acquire real estate.Transaction costs usually add up to around 10 percent of the purchase price. This includes the 3.5 percent property tax, a 1.1 percent land registry fee, about 2 percent for lawyers fees, and 3.6 percent to the agent, Mr. Buxbaum said.Citizens of European Union countries should not have trouble obtaining financing  usually for up to 60 percent of the purchase price  but other foreigners may find the banks more reluctant, Ms. Harpham said.WEBSITESTown of Mattsee:  mattsee.atGuide to Buying Property in Austria:  otto.at/downloads/otto_buying-guide-austrian.aspxAustrian Tourist Office:  austria.info/usLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYGerman; euro (1 euro = $1.13)TAXES AND FEESThere is no annual property tax.CONTACTMarlies Muhr, Marlies Muhr Real Estate, (011 43) 662-431-545;  muhr-immobilien.at"}
{"text": "In 2009, Bill de Blasio and Mark Green, both Democrats running for public advocate, were asked to name the most interesting New Yorker they knew.Mr. Green paused a moment, then singled out John Sexton, the erudite Jesuit-trained magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, best-selling author and president of New York University at the time.Mr. de Blasio responded with the name of another, if lesser-known, native: Mary Sansone.Mrs. Sansone, a 4-foot-11 daughter of Italian immigrants, celebrated her 100th birthday this week, still dispensing political wisdom and homemade meatballs from the home she and her husband bought in 1956 in Borough Park, Brooklyn, her headquarters as godmother to liberal candidates she deems deserving.I took part in every movement for justice, whether it was union rights, civil rights, human rights, womens rights or gay rights, she said.In 2014, when he last feted her, Mayor de Blasio said of Mrs. Sansone: No matter how much the times change, she is relevant to the times, because of the way she lives. There are some great people whose time passed them by. Mary is urgent and vibrant to this day.As hundreds of her fans prepared to personally congratulate her on Tuesday night at the Dyker Beach Golf Course in Brooklyn, Mrs. Sansone complained that the world had become more hypocritical and that people were afraid to tell each other the truth.Still, she said, Let me tell you, its not bad to be 100.My biggest accomplishment was that I had the strength to do what I wanted to do and stand up for what I believed, she added, As my father said, when you die, you cant take your money with you. You can only take your integrity.At the celebration, Mr. de Blasio proclaimed Mary Sansone Day in New York, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented Mrs. Sansone with a T-shirt emblazoned with Bloomberg/Sansone 2016 and the slogan A Meatball in Every Pot.Born Mary Crisalli on June 12, 1916, in what was then South Brooklyn and is now called Carroll Gardens, she began her lifelong commitment to social activism as an 8-year-old, when her father perched her on a soapbox in Union Square as he addressed potential recruits to the Industrial Workers of the World, a prominent union. She recalled the moment in a 1976 book, Nobody Speaks for Me!: Self-Portraits of American Working Class Women.When she was 12, she joined the Junior Wobblies, the youth contingent of the socialist-inspired labor organization. (Still, she said she had voted for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, in the New York Democratic presidential primary.)She later organized workers in grime-filled sweatshops, served with the Red Cross and directed American relief to Italy after World War II.In 1964, Mrs. Sansone and her husband, Zack, founded the Congress of Italian-American Organizations, a statewide social-service federation known by the acronym CIAO.Mrs. Sansone rose from Borough Park folk hero to greater fame through a flurry of introductions to the powerful, from Detective Sgt. Ralph Salerno, an authority on organized crime, to Nicholas Pileggi, the journalist and author who wrote Wiseguys, to Mayor John V. Lindsay, who in the late 1960s had been accused of favoring minority groups and was trying to woo whites.A visit by the black civil rights leader Bayard Rustin in 1971 heralded an ambitious effort to unite the citys black, Hispanic and so-called white ethnic communities in a common agenda, working with the New York Urban Coalition.Mrs. Sansone invited Mr. Rustin and other black and Hispanic leaders to her home, and publicly confronted challenges her community often did not make public. Many Italian groups did not like us becoming involved with other ethnic groups, she recalled.Her biggest run-in was with Joseph Colombo, the organized crime leader who had formed the Italian-American Civil Rights League. He proposed that they join forces. Mrs. Sansone refused.At its height CIAO ran two dozen programs with a multimillion-dollar budget, provided scholarships and operated a day care center and a senior center. It suffered a setback in the 1977 mayoral race, when Mrs. Sansone supported Mario M. Cuomo while the Brooklyn Democratic organization backed Edward I. Koch, who won.And she was fired by the board after it accused her of nepotism, which she freely admitted. During the early days, when some undesirable Italian-American organizations wanted to take us over, they were the only ones I knew I could trust, she said."}
{"text": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is overreaching in its quest for market safety and soundness.The agency wants the power to obtain access to the source codes of trading companies without a subpoena. Record retention is a worthy goal, but it is unclear whether the strapped regulator can protect such intellectual property. Worse, it may open the door for other officials to ask for the same unusual gateway.Market participants are justified in their concerns about the agencys proposal. As part of its plan to rein in the risks of automated trading, the regulator, which mainly looks after commodities markets, wants companies to store their source code in a repository, which would be easily accessible to its officials. The Justice Department would also be granted access.The intentions of the commission, led by its chairman, Timothy G. Massad, are valid given recent market-manipulation cases. One worry is that traders could spoof the market, the practice of making and then quickly canceling orders, and make the algorithms disappear. But the agency could require traders to maintain records without being given extraordinary powers. The commission has already successfully pursued several spoofing cases with its current authorities.There is reason to wonder whether the agency could protect the source codes it might obtain. Like the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is perennially underfunded. Every year, lawmakers either cut its expense requests or leave its budget flat. Even government entities with fewer resource problems, like the White House, are vulnerable to hacking.Other agencies could see this as an opening to push for unfettered access. For example, the Federal Trade Commission could argue it needed to regularly inspect the search algorithms of Alphabets Google when examining antitrust concerns. The Justice Department was viewed as pushing legal boundaries when it sued Apple to force the company to provide access to a mass shooters iPhone.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been hearing out the concerns. The agency reopened the comment period for the proposal and held a discussion with industry participants last week. Officials have repeatedly said they wanted to ensure that the rule enshrined confidentiality. Protecting the integrity of the markets is an important goal. But so is preventing the government agency from starting down a dangerous and slippery slope."}
{"text": "LONDON  For the first time in its 170-year history, the Smithsonian Institution will establish a permanent presence outside the United States. The Washington-based Smithsonian and the Victoria and Albert Museum in the British capital announced on Monday that they would collaborate on a new exhibition space in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in East London, the site of the 2012 Games.A new branch of the Victoria and Albert Museum will share space with the Smithsonian outpost  alongside a cluster of other institutions, including Sadlers Wells Theater, University College London and the London College of Fashion  in a major cultural complex called Olympicopolis, due to open in 2021.In January 2015, the Smithsonian had announced that it was considering opening a 40,000-square-foot, or roughly 3,700-square-meter, exhibition space in the park. It had been reported that the London authorities promised to contribute an estimated $50 million to support construction and the shipping of exhibits for an independent Smithsonian building. Instead, the American institution will run a jointly organized permanent gallery space, according to press materials, with the new Victoria and Albert branch, which will be called V&A East.Is the contribution from the city of London still on the table? In a telephone interview, Albert G. Horvath, the Smithsonians under secretary for finance and administration, sounded vague. The support of the former mayor, Boris Johnson, was tremendous, he said, and we are feeling the same support from the new mayor, Sadiq Khan.In a joint news release, the institutions said the Smithsonian exhibitions and programs in London would be supported by contributions from the private sector, with the help of Foundation for FutureLondon, a new charity established for Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.Tim Reeve, deputy director and chief operating officer of the Victoria and Albert, said the museum had been eager to work closely with the Smithsonian ever since it heard about the institutions interest in Olympicopolis, a 4.5-acre waterside site close to the Olympic Stadium.Its a great institution, enormous, with an incredible collection that is complementary to ours, he said, referring to the Smithsonian. It seemed obvious to us from early on that some of the subjects we were keen to investigate would be better done together.The Smithsonian started to move away from the idea of a real estate transaction and to the idea of a collaborative project, Mr. Horvath said.The amount of annual operating overhead cast a big shadow over the primary objective: How do we get broader exposure for the Smithsonian internationally? he said. But one of the main attractions early on was to be connected to a number of other cultural institutions.Referring to the Victoria and Albert, Mr. Horvath added: It was astounding to us how similar our visions for the future are. We are both thinking about what a 21st-century museum should do, presenting content differently through digital media and technology, engaging audiences who might not be inspired to visit our institutions. To us, it seemed like a marriage made in heaven, and as time went on, we began to feel that it would be preferable to collaborate.Mr. Reeve said that the two organizations had lots of ideas about possible exhibitions that would be planned over the next year. While there was no decision on how the roughly 195,000-square-foot building would be divided up, he said, the Smithsonian would have significant space.Its super, super exciting, he added. I think its great news for London."}
{"text": "Pregnant women should take folic acid, a B vitamin, during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in their babies. Now a new study, in JAMA Pediatrics, has found that sufficient folic acid during pregnancy may reduce the risk for obesity in children.Researchers studied 1,517 mother-child pairs, measuring the mothers folic acid blood levels at delivery and following the children through average age 6. After controlling for other variables in both mother and child, they found that compared with those mothers who had folic acid levels in the highest three-quarters, those with levels in the lowest one-quarter had a 45 percent higher risk for obesity in their children.Folic acid may be especially beneficial for obese mothers. Among obese mothers with the lowest folic acid levels, the risk of obesity in their children more than tripled. But in children of obese mothers, the risk for obesity was 43 percent lower if their mothers were in the top three-quarters for folic acid levels than if they were in the bottom one-quarter.Experts advise that all pregnant women take a 400-microgram supplement of folic acid daily. But the senior author, Dr. Xiaobin Wang, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins, said that there is no perfect correlation between the supplement dose taken and blood levels. So for an overweight mother, its probably worth the trouble to do a blood test, she said. Its not an expensive test, and its important information. We try to make an individualized decision, and this is a more precise way to do it."}
{"text": "As families began planning funerals for the victims of Sundays rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., gay Americans mourned a loss that extended beyond the lives cut short.Omar Mateen shattered the tenuous, hard-fought sense of personal safety that many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have begun to feel as the movement for equality has made significant gains in recent years. His bullets and the blood he left behind that early morning were a reminder that in many corners of the country, gay and transgender people are still regarded as sinners and second-class citizens who should be scorned.While the precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear, it is evident that Mr. Mateen was driven by hatred toward gays and lesbians. Hate crimes dont happen in a vacuum. They occur where bigotry is allowed to fester, where minorities are vilified and where people are scapegoated for political gain. Tragically, this is the state of American politics, driven too often by Republican politicians who see prejudice as something to exploit, not extinguish.Since the 1990s, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans have made considerable progress in the fight for equality under the law. By living openly and proudly, they have changed societys attitudes about sexual orientation and gender identity. That shift has prompted politicians who were once wary about embracing equal rights for L.G.B.T. Americans  including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee  to become resolute allies. The 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage was celebrated by many in the gay community as the crowning achievement of a decades-long quest for respect and dignity.Yet, that fight remains far from over. Since the marriage ruling, several Republican-led state legislatures and Republican governors and federal lawmakers have redoubled their fight against legal protections for people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. So far this year, more than 200 anti-L.G.B.T. bills have been introduced in 34 states.Donald Trump, unlike some other prominent Republicans, called the Orlando massacre what it was: an attack on gay people. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, could not even offer that recognition to a community in pain.Yet, Mr. Trump has vowed to choose Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality, and he supports the deceptively named First Amendment Defense Act, an effort to approve discrimination against gay and transgender people nationwide under the guise of religious freedom. And Mr. Trump backtracked from his statement that transgender people should be able to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity after Senator Ted Cruz used his words to attack him during the nomination fight.That restrooms have become such a fixation, particularly at the state level, is a worrying reminder of the entrenched stigma the community continues to face. The loudest advocates of this odious effort have been Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who has worked in lock step with the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton. Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi in April signed into law a bill that allows discrimination against L.G.B.T. people in schools and the workplace.Its hard to say how many politicians take these positions as a matter of principle and how many do so because it has proved to be an effective way in the past to raise money and turn out the vote. As the funerals are held for those who perished on Sunday, lawmakers who have actively championed discriminatory laws and policies, and those who have quietly enabled them with votes, should force themselves to read the obituaries and look at the photos. The 49 people killed in Orlando were victims of a terrorist attack. But they also need to be remembered as casualties of a society where hate has deep roots."}

This spring, they traveled to Tulsa, Okla., where Cassidy reported on low breastfeeding rates among the poorest women in the United States.America is startlingly inferior to five of the worlds poorest countries  at least by one metric.When it comes to a crucial health behavior, Malawi, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Niger are among the most advanced; America lags far behind. Why?We dont breastfeed.Thats right. America: the land of the free and the home of the formula fed.The norm has really shifted, said Ellen Piwoz, senior program officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation nutrition team.For many mothers  particularly those who are young, black, poor or who have less than a college education  nursing is not an obvious option.Thats a shame, because breast milk has a wealth of natural health benefits. Evidence suggests that nursing can protect against obesity, infant ear infections and even breast and ovarian cancer in the mother. Multiple studies found a consistent increase of about 3 I.Q. points in children who were breastfed.An important note: experts agree on the benefits of breastfeeding babies in low-income countries, but the evidence is sparser in wealthy nations like America, where confounding factors muddy the data. (A mother who breastfeeds is more likely to have other healthy habits as well.)Still, Piwoz said, The benefits are obvious in poor countries, so its likely American kids would get this benefit as well.Affluent moms in America breastfeed, but theres a class and a race gap. Because fewer young, black, poor and uneducated mothers nurse, a subset of American babies fall behind with their first bottle, compounding other kinds of disadvantage. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 58.9 percent of black infants have ever breastfed, compared to 75.2 percent of whites and 80 percent of Hispanics.This isnt a chance to cast blame on formula-feeding moms  just the opposite. We need to acknowledge the barriers to breastfeeding and support moms who try.In Tulsa, Oklahoma, I met a single mother named Shaeriah Fox when she visited Emergency Infant Services, a non-profit organization that gives out diapers, car seats, formula and other necessities to families in crisis.At just 19 years old, Fox has survived more misfortune than most. She grew up with heroin-addicted parents, dropped out of school after eighth grade and landed in a gang at age 13. A few years ago, she escaped the gang, got pregnant and has raised her two children  a 2-year-old girl and an 8-month-old boy  with help from her grandmother.Fox had come to Emergency Infant Services because she ran out of food and diapers.When she gave birth to her daughter, she tried breastfeeding for a night. It felt weird and I didnt like it, Fox said.Faced with raising her daughter alone, she had more pressing concerns than learning to nurse comfortably. She opted out.Formula was easily available through the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program and Emergency Infant Services. Both programs encourage breastfeeding, but allow moms to decide for themselves.And here, we meet the confusing incentives that drive formula feeding. Social programs should provide formula to babies who need it, but in doing so, do they inadvertently promote bottle feeding for mothers who could nurse? Couple that with aggressive marketing by the $3 billion formula industry, the challenges of pumping and refrigerating milk and a lack of knowledge about the biology of breastfeeding. Why should a young mother believe the effort to nurse is worthwhile?There is a commercial and promotional aspect to it, that  not meaning to be a pun  feeds in to this, Piwoz said. The free supplies, the direct, indirect messages that formula is as good as or just like breast milk, messages that get conveyed either directly or indirectly that your milk isnt good enough.But in upper- and middle-class communities, a new, trendy industry cheers on moms who choose to breastfeed. Nursing boutiques like The Upper Breast Side and Yummy Mummy offer nursing bras, pump consultations and lactation cookies, with oats, brewers yeast and flax seed to boost milk production.Lets build on that momentum and cast some love (not judgment) toward the moms who can barely afford food and diapers  much less automatic breast pumps or lactation cookies. If youre a healthy, young mother whose milk runneth over, you can donate to a local milk bank. Or look into an organization called La Leche League International, which provides breastfeeding support, and perhaps most crucially, education.While we fight against the income gap and the education gap, lets not forget the milk gap."}
{"text": "DENVER  It had to be nostalgic for Joe Girardi when he arrived at Coors Field on Tuesday. In the other dugout was Colorado Manager Walt Weiss, who developed a close friendship with Girardi when they were members of the expansion franchise and helped the Rockies to the playoffs in 1995, their third season.Those were the days before baseballs were placed in humidors and when the thin mountain air, the canyon-like outfield gaps and bulked-up hitters made the place a horror house for pitchers.But Girardi was surely reminded of those no-lead-is-safe evenings when the Rockies outlasted the Yankees, 13-10, on Tuesday night.The Yankees rallied from a 12-3 deficit with seven runs in the eighth inning, and they had the tying run on base when Didi Gregorius, who earlier in the game had hit a three-run homer, grounded out against reliever Jason Motte to end the inning.The Rockies added to their cushion in the bottom of the eighth when Carlos Gonzalez blasted a home run to center field off Andrew Miller. It was the third home run of the night for the Rockies, including a 454-foot homer by Trevor Story deep over the center-field wall. The Rockies had five other extra-base hits.Carlos Estevez, the Rockies seventh reliever of the game, pitched a drama-free ninth to finally finish the Yankees off, sending them to their third consecutive loss. The 13 runs the Yankees allowed were a season high.This is a crazy place to play, Girardi said. If youve got a 10-run lead, youd like to say you feel pretty good about it, but thats not always the case here.The Yankees found themselves fighting uphill against Colorado starter Jorge De La Rosa, who continued his mastery of the Yankees, who must be thankful that they rarely see him in the American League. Temporarily banished to the bullpen last month, De La Rosa improved to 4-0 against the Yankees, and he has not given up a run in 22 innings in four career starts against them.The Yankees did not get a similar outing from Nathan Eovaldi. He was outstanding in winning five consecutive starts in May, but Eovaldi has allowed 16 runs in his last three starts.Eovaldi has had trouble with his split-fingered fastball in all three starts. Thats his big pitch, Girardi said. Thats the pitch that he gets swings and misses. Right now, hes struggling with it.When De La Rosa left, Gregorius provided a brief spark, lining a two-out, full-count, three-run homer to right that brought the Yankees to within 6-3 in the sixth. Aaron Hicks followed with a single before pinch-hitter Alex Rodriguez grounded out. Carlos Beltran, who leads the Yankees with 16 home runs, was unavailable after waking up with a swollen left knee. He had the knee drained and is unlikely to play on Wednesday.But the Rockies pushed across three more runs against Kirby Yates and Richard Bleier in the bottom of the sixth and added three more in the seventh against Bleier, two scoring on Daniel Descalsos triple. That 12-3 lead was a necessary surplus.The Yankees rally in the eighth had an unusual element, especially here. The Yankees simply strung a series of singles together  eight in all, along with a hit by pitch.Obviously, when youre down nine runs, you need to hit a lot, said Chase Headley, who was here with the Padres when the Rockies scored three runs in the bottom of the 13th to beat San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman in a one-game playoff in 2007. But theres a lot of real estate to get hits.Rob Refsnyder had two hits in the Yankees rally, which also included a pinch-hit single by Ike Davis, the former Met who was making his debut for the Yankees."}
{"text": "Its hard to get ones head around it: An initial public offering that would value a company in the trillions of dollars. Thats trillions, with a T.Saudi Arabia is considering selling shares in its state oil company. With 261 billion barrels of oil in reserves and a yearly output of over three billion barrels of oil, the company, Saudi Aramco, is a behemoth by any measure.Its so big that the companys valuation is estimated at $1 trillion to $2 trillion; some put the figure as high as $10 trillion.A sale of a 5 percent stake would be the largest I.P.O. ever, with proceeds most likely approaching $100 billion. The investment banker fees may exceed $1 billion, which has prompted a feeding frenzy at this once-in-a-lifetime sale.Even so, the real eye-opening development may not be the amount of money involved, but where the Saudi government chooses to list the shares.If it decides to list only on the home country exchange, it will be a conservative choice with minimal impact. But if it seeks a listing in New York, London or Hong Kong, it could be revolutionary.The choice matters so much because this can really be thought of as an I.P.O. of the whole country.The oil company generated an estimated $180 billion in profit per year to the state, which represented over 40 percent of its economy, at least before the recent slump in oil prices. We dont know the exact figures because they arent published, but we do know that about 90 percent of the Saudi governments budget comes from oil profits. So Saudi Arabia is effectively Aramco, the company founded in 1933 by Standard Oil of California (now Chevron).If Aramco lists only on the Saudi exchange, the I.P.O. will swamp the current market capitalization of the exchange, which is $300 billion to $400 billion, and dominate trading. In this environment where the company is the dominant one and is a creature of the state, Aramco can set its own rules on disclosure and other regulation, providing little comfort to foreign shareholders.But the latest indications are there will be a global listing in New York, Hong Kong and London.If Aramco goes to New York, it will be subjecting itself to the full array of United States securities laws applicable to foreign companies. This will require extensive disclosure and will subject the company to the scrutiny of the public market.It would also mean that American investors, both big and small, could easily invest. A New York listing would be a way of bringing the company  and by implication, the country  into the full financial sphere.This may be why the Saudis are considering such a move. The kingdom knows that its centurys worth of oil reserves may very likely never be used as the world shifts to greener, carbon-free energy. So it is selling now to reap some money while the going is good. Moreover, given the state of the Saudi budget and its current budget deficit  $98 billion last year  a successful I.P.O. will help ease local economic woes.A New York Times editorial said buyer beware about an I.P.O., citing the state of oil and the Saudi kingdom. Indeed, the stock sale is no panacea and will not radically change what is, by all measures, a repressive regime.Nonetheless, an offering is a step in transitioning the kingdom toward a more sustainable and more open post-oil economy.Having Aramco subject to United States financial reporting will itself be something of a shock to the Saudi system. It would be as if an entire country suddenly became listed and regulated by outside capital markets.That New York is even being considered for the offering highlights the continued strength of American capital markets in the years after the financial crisis.When issuers choose to list abroad these days, for the most part they go to New York. The only other real competitor is London. And when these global I.P.O.s happen, it is American banks that largely organize them. In this case, the lead adviser for Aramco is JPMorgan Chase, which has worked with the kingdom for decades. It stands first in line for what could be more than $1 billion in fees.This is a remarkable turn of events. After the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002, there was a loud outcry that the United States was losing its stock listings.Yet foreign listings have remained robust. In 2014 and 2015, they accounted for 22 percent and 18 percent of all I.P.O.s in the United States, according to Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida.And these were listings by prominent companies like Alibaba, Manchester United and Ferrari.Hong Kong and Singapore, at the same time, have not drawn foreign I.P.O.s in any significant measure. Last year, Singapore had four.This is where it gets interesting for the Aramco I.P.O. If it does decide to list to the United States, a difficult task awaits. Audited financial statements for a public company would need to be prepared, work that could take years. Aramco would have to decide which assets to keep and which would remain private.The states control will have to be formalized, including whether the offering will include an interest in the kingdoms oil reserves or be confined to other assets.Aramco, which is generally regarded as well run for a state enterprise, will have to adopt a board that may have outside members and to prepare for the criticism of the market. Some trimming of fat will also be needed. In recent years, the company has invested far afield in chemical and solar assets.Because of this, I am skeptical that an I.P.O. will happen soon. But I am also optimistic that if it does, and it goes to list in New York or London or Hong Kong, this can be a game changer for a country that is seeking to diversify its economy. (And yes, like all emerging market offerings, this is a risky one  perhaps even more so given the state of the Middle East and world oil  so retail buyers should beware.)I may be overstating the potential for Saudi Arabia, which is still very much a closed regime and will probably remain one for some time. But the attraction of the United States stock market  and the disclosures and changes the Saudis would have to make to take part  show the transformative power of global capital. An Aramco I.P.O. could be a victory for New York."}

Mr. David, who was also a creator of Seinfeld, has said for years that he was unsure if there would be a ninth season.HBO did not announce when the series ninth season would begin filming or when it would air.Curb Your Enthusiasm was broadcast from 2000 to 2011 with a total of 80 episodes. Mr. Davids vaguely autobiographical character became a beloved avatar of misanthropes everywhere. The show was nominated seven times for the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series , and it won the Golden Globe for best comedy in 2002.With the show officially returning, it becomes HBOs longest-running scripted series.Speculation kicked off in recent days that the show would return when the actor J.B. Smoove, who played Leon on Curb Your Enthusiasm, said he had spoken to Mr. David about the shows possible comeback.In a statement, Mr. David said, In the immortal words of Julius Caesar, I left, I did nothing, I returned.In the years since Curb Your Enthusiasm last aired, Mr. David wrote and starred in a Broadway play, Fish in the Dark, and portrayed Bernie Sanders in the most recent season of Saturday Night Live, a performance that earned him wide praise. He also helped write and starred in the 2013 HBO movie Clear History.HBOs new president of programming, Casey Bloys, said in a statement: Were thrilled that Larry has decided to do a new season of Curb and cant wait to see what he has planned."}
{"text": "LONDON  The young, thin model wore a bright yellow bikini and stared seductively at passers-by.Are you beach body ready? asked the ad for Protein World, a maker of dietary supplements. The ad was defaced in subway stations across London when it appeared in April 2015, and it drew strong protests.On Monday, Londons new mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a ban on such ads  which critics call fat-shaming  from Londons public transportation system starting in July, saying the messages encourage unhealthy body images for young women.As the father of two teenage girls, I am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising, which can demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies, Mr. Khan said. Nobody should feel pressurized, while they travel on the Tube or bus, into unrealistic expectations surrounding their bodies.The move is the latest effort by the authorities in Europe and elsewhere to address concerns about unrealistic or unhealthy body images in advertising, and the effect that impossibly thin models can have on the self-esteem and health of consumers. France, Israel, Italy and Spain have enacted policies aimed at preventing models with stick-thin bodies from working in the industry.The mayor, who said he wanted to send a clear message to the advertising industry, said the new guidelines would apply to any form of transit run by Transport for London that could create body-confidence issues.An estimated 12,000 ads appear annually in Londons transportation network, and Mr. Khan was following through on a campaign pledge in imposing restrictions on them.Transport for London said in a statement that it would not allow ads that could reasonably be seen as likely to cause pressure to conform to an unrealistic or unhealthy body shape, or as likely to create body-confidence issues, particularly among young people.Graeme Craig, the agencys commercial development director, said the new rules were necessary because passengers were a captive audience.Unlike ads that appear in other forums, like television, online and print, he said, passengers on public transportation cannot simply switch off or turn a page if an advertisement offends or upsets them  and we have a duty to ensure the copy we carry reflects that unique environment.The announcement of the ban inspired mixed reactions, with some saying that Mr. Khan, a member of the Labour Party, had performed a public service by fighting the regular portrayal of unrealistic body types.A great start for Londons feminist Mayor  Womens Equality Party wrote on Twitter.But some critics suggested that Mr. Khan, a Muslim, was using the ad ban to clamp down on racy images of women because they were counter to the norms of conservative Islam. Mr. Khans office declined to comment when asked about that line of criticism.Mr. Khan is the son of a bus driver who grew up in public housing, and his religion  drew attention in the mayoral race, with a rival candidate, Zac Goldsmith, accusing him of giving oxygen and cover to extremists.Ian Twinn, a spokesman for the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, which represents about 450 British companies, said he had no problem with the regulation as long as it focused solely on not promoting unhealthy body images.Parents dont want their children to see ads of models who are unhealthily thin children, and send out a message that this is what you should look like, he said. Equally, we dont want people who are comfortably chubby threatening to ban perfectly reasonable ads. We are not meant to go around with excessive fat on our waists. If fat is the new normal, we dont want that to be the reason to censor people who are not fat. That seems barmy.Mr. Twinn said the model in the Protein World ad had a toned and athletic body, a perspective that was echoed by the Advertising Standards Authority.After receiving 378 complaints last year about the ad, the advertising board ruled that it was not offensive or irresponsible. It did, however, ban the ad because of concerns about its health and weight loss claims.Protein World, for its part, told the board that the phrase beach body was commonly used and understood to mean looking ones best.It said that the model in the ad had a healthy figure and that the company did not believe that the ad implied everyone should look like the model or that the text and image were irresponsible.Last year, the French Parliament approved measures aimed at preventing modeling agencies from hiring models deemed dangerously thin.Under the law, models need a doctors certificate to certify they are fit to work, and employers are at risk of jail or fines of 75,000 euros, or about $85,000, if they break the rules."}
{"text": "Bloomsday commemorates the life of the writer James Joyce. Celebrated on June 16, it is named after Leopold Bloom, the central character in Joyces Ulysses.  Below is an excerpt from the review of the novel, shortly after it was published in Paris, in February 1922.ULYSSES, by James Joyce. (Shakespeare and Company  Sylvia Beach  Paris. Edition de luxe, 150fr, 250fr, 350fr.)Mr. James Joyces Ulysses is written in a dozen styles. In its general outline a very close resemblance to the typical Joyce manner of expression may be found in the ordinary productions of the ouija board Anyone who has ever attempted to piece together the incoherent array of words and sentences expressed by the planchette will have a fairly good idea of the difficulty encountered in reading Ulysses. There are score upon score of pages that resemble ouijas incoherent writing. They resemble the ouijas writing also, strangely enough, in subject-matter.It is not intended for a moment to suggest that any portion of Ulysses was written by the aid of the ouija board. The book has been too carefully and consciously wrought.When James Joyces Ulysses was first published in 1922, it was banned for obscenity and the U.S. Postal Service burned copies.\n\nRead moreIt has not been written easily. Mr. Joyces own formula has imposed upon him certain limitations which careless writing would be certain to overstep. There is to be found in Ulysses some of the finest English that has been written. Mr. Joyce has a marvellous aptitude for turning phrases. He knows how to put just the right Irish on his words. To him the inexpressible does not exist. He proves the suppleness, the flexibility of English. Undoubtedly, it is this compelling display of verbal virtuosity that will keep many a reader reading on and on and on, even. when the sense escapes him. There is in Ulysses a witchery of words that woos.About the morality of the piece, there is only one thing to say. It may be pernicious, it may be salutary, according to the spirit in which it is read. Every reader will make of it what he himself is. It is, therefore, neither moral nor immoral. The question of obscenity is also a purely relative one. Everything is relativeeven the theory of relativity. To anyone with an innocence of the eye for words there is nothing obscene in Ulysses, although it does contain a-plenty of what Walter Pater might have called racy morsels of the vernacular.To those who find their chief literary inspiration in the so-called clean fiction of to-day, Ulysses will not come as a gem of purest ray. That is because it is too uncompromisingly true to life. The reader who is not hypocritical, when he finishes the book, will say, with the grisette Mimi, that here is a picture of life, eujus pars magna sum.  The New York Herald, April 24, 1922"}
{"text": "VILLENEUVE-DASCQ, France  The Russian soccer federation was fined about $170,000 and given a suspended disqualification from the European Championships on Tuesday as punishment for in-stadium fan violence. The sanction essentially leaves the Russian team on the verge of being kicked out of the continents most prestigious tournament two years before Russia hosts the World Cup.The penalties were issued by the disciplinary committee of UEFA, which oversees European soccer, and put Russia one further incident away from the extraordinary possibility of being sent home in the midst of a major competition. Russias next game is Wednesday, in a group-stage match here, just outside Lille, against Slovakia.In a statement, the disciplinary committee said that Russias disqualification from the tournament was currently suspended  in other words, not being enforced  but that such suspension will be lifted if incidents of a similar nature (crowd disturbances) happen inside the stadium at any of the remaining matches of the Russian team during the tournament.The statement did not specify what would constitute a violation, though other UEFA documentation defines crowd disturbances broadly, including actions ranging from fighting to throwing objects to disrupting national anthems to the use of gestures, words, objects or any other means to transmit any message that is not fit for a sports event.Tuesdays punishment was the result of ugly incidents at the end of Russias first match in the tournament, a 1-1 tie with England on Saturday in Marseille. Just after the final whistle, video showed a mass of Russian fans  many of them wearing gloves more common in mixed martial arts fighting and with shirts or scarves covering their faces  streaming into a nearby section full of English fans and attacking them. Fireworks and flares were also set off inside the stadium during the match.The two groups of fans had clashed with each other, local residents and the police in the streets of Marseille in the days before the match  resulting in a slew of arrests  but the in-stadium violence was unexpected, both for its scale and its coordination. The Russian soccer federation said it would accept the punishment announced Tuesday but that it considered it extremely severe.A spokesman for Vladimir V. Putin, Russias president, denounced the rampages in Marseille. The spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, added, Its absolutely unacceptable, and we certainly expect our citizens to respect the countrys laws.Vitaly Mutko, Russias sports minister and a senior official with FIFA, which governs world soccer, said he supported the deportations from France of any fans who were seeking to cause trouble. But the violence flared anew in Lille on Tuesday. Videos posted online showed England and Wales fans in a confrontation with Russian supporters outside a sidewalk bar, though helmeted riot police officers quickly moved between the groups.A bus containing 29 Russian fans on their way to Lille for Russias next match was stopped by local law enforcement officials earlier Tuesday, and it was expected that French authorities would deport the fans.We know that 29 people will be deported as they have arrived not to watch football, Mr. Mutko said, according to TASS, a Russian news agency.Russias problems with fan violence and hooliganism have been a recurrent issue for many years, but the issue has received greater scrutiny because the country is set to host the next World Cup. Russian officials frequently play down the problem, often citing bias by the Western news media, but governing bodies like UEFA and FIFA are concerned. In official statements noteworthy for their strong language, UEFA expressed utter disgust at the stadium violence, and FIFA blamed idiotic troublemakers.The reaction in Russia to the fan violence has been ambiguous, with some officials cheering on the violence in their comments and on social media. The Kremlin on Tuesday sought to clarify that the more bellicose comments by officials did not represent official policy. I cant agree with these statements from my colleagues, Mr. Peskov said. In any case, they cannot reflect the official points of view.UEFAs disciplinary committee did not sanction England on Tuesday  only Russia was charged, for the in-stadium incidents  but UEFAs powerful executive committee warned both Russia and England that they faced expulsion after Saturdays incident. The executive committee can issue punishments for incidents that take place away from stadiums if it determines it appropriate.Roy Hodgson, Englands manager, and Wayne Rooney, its captain, recorded a video asking English fans to behave appropriately for the rest of the tournament. The message was pointed, as England and Russia fans will cross paths again this week.Russia will play here on Wednesday afternoon, a day before England faces Wales in Lens, about 20 miles away. Many English fans are staying in hotels in Lille, a larger city, while they are in the region.Fabienne Buccio, who manages the police and security in the region, said at a briefing Tuesday that more than 2,400 security officers would be assigned to the England match in Lens. Enhanced procedures are also expected at Russias match near Lille, and restrictions on alcohol sales have been put in place throughout the region.At a news conference here Tuesday afternoon, Russias manager, Leonid Slutsky, and one of its top players, Artem Dzyuba, struck variable tones. Initially, both men noted that Russias fans had given them strong support during the teams first game and urged them to behave this week. We have to follow the rules, Mr. Slutsky said, addressing the fans. We do need your support, but we have to focus on the support of our team and do it in a legal framework.As the news conference went on, however, the sentiments from Mr. Slutsky and Mr. Dzyuba seemed to shift. A high-ranking official with Russias soccer federation, Igor Lebedev, had previously praised Russian fans for fighting in the stadium  he told a Russian news agency the fans were defending the honor of their country  and while neither Mr. Slutsky nor Mr. Dzyuba echoed Mr. Lebedevs sentiments, Mr. Dzyuba did criticize the British news media for portraying English fans like angels. He also questioned reports from the French police that Russian fans were the aggressors in the stadium disturbances.You have your information from the French; I have other information, he said, without elaborating. Mr. Dzyuba then speculated that Russia was being targeted because of lingering controversy over its being awarded the hosting rights for the World Cup, a bid it won over a group of competitors that included England.Mr. Slutsky said that Russian fans were incited by English fans being disrespectful during the Russian national anthem before the game, as well as for gestures the Russian team received while on its bus to the stadium. When the Russian anthem was played, people were shouting, Mr. Slutsky said. It was unethical.After the news conference, Mr. Slutsky led the Russian players through a short training session at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. The players seemed in good spirits and, during the portion of the practice open to the news media, bounced around and laughed with one another, particularly as they participated in a small-sided game of rugby.Russia won the Euros in 1960 (as the Soviet Union) and finished third at the 2008 tournament. It qualified for this years tournament by finishing second in its group and, after salvaging a tie against England in its opening game, is in good position to advance to the knockout rounds in France.We are not at a street fighting championship over here, Mr. Dzyuba said. We are talking about the Euro 2016 football championship."}

{"text": "The travel writer Bruce Chatwin, in order to commune with nature, was known to hike naked. Sometimes he would tie flowers around his private parts.In his intensely strange and terrifically vivid new book, Being a Beast: Adventures Across the Species Divide, the English naturalist Charles Foster occasionally removes his clothes as well. He hopes to understand what it might feel like, out in the wild, to be a badger, an otter, a fox, a deer or a swift.Sometimes he is, to borrow the title of a television show, naked and afraid. Mostly he is merely cold and irritably witty. Being a Beast reads like what you might get if you took a writer like Julian Barnes or Anthony Lane and dropped him into the woods with only a granola bar and a pointy stick.Being a Beast is about Mr. Fosters rewilding, his efforts to grope at extreme otherness. He lives for six weeks alongside badgers in a hill in Wales. Like an otter, he tries to snatch fish with his teeth.When he behaves like an urban fox in London, strangers think he is a lunatic. He arranges to be hunted by bloodhounds, as a deer might be. He becomes dreamy about swifts (birds that resemble swallows) while nibbling on their favorite insects, as if they were winged mixed nuts.Nature writing has generally been about humans striding colonially around, describing what they see from six feet above the ground, Mr. Foster writes. In this book, he gets distressingly close to the earth. He breathes deeply of the peaty soil, so deeply you fear he will inhale a fire ant.If neuroscience has recently taught us a good deal about how the brains of animals function, Mr. Foster says, the literary adventure has barely begun. It is one thing to describe which areas of a badgers brain light up on a functional M.R.I. scanner as it sniffs a slug. It is quite another to paint a picture of the whole wood as it appears to the badger.It is still another to pry a flattened squirrel off the road, as Mr. Foster does in the badger chapter, along with his young son, and eat the thing cooked with wood sorrel and wild garlic.Mr. Foster is humble about the limitations of his project. He tries to avoid the pitfalls of traditional nature writing, such as anthropocentrism (believing humans are the planets central species) and anthropomorphism (attributing human traits and emotions to animals). Of course I have failed, he adds.His awareness of his failures makes him all the more winning. He decides it has been ridiculous to grow his toenails long, for example, in imitation of a deers hooves. Deer have hard lives. There was no point in not cutting my toenails, he comments, if I couldnt also be persecuted from the beginning of time.Mr. Foster builds a case that it is important and, indeed, oddly humanizing to try to get close to nature. You may find yourself in agreement while being glad its him out there, not you.He taste-tests worms. (Worms from the high Kent Weald are fresh and uncomplicated; theyd appear in the list recommended with a grilled sole.) He defecates here and there to mark territory. He shoots down rapids and crawls through grass. He turns over a piece of fetid pizza with his nose. He vomits grass, shrubs and leaves into his mouth to approximate a feel for chewing cud.Mr. Foster is a veterinarian who teaches medical law and ethics at the University of Oxford. He can come across like a frenzied hippie, but he arrives at his embrace of animal ways from a somewhat more sober perspective: that of a serious former hunter.I bought my daughter a .410 shotgun when she was 10, he writes. I whipped in to beagles, rode to foxhounds and staghounds, and had a monthly column in The Shooting Times. My name is in gold-embossed game books in some nice country houses. He regrets some of his former blood lust.He is aware of himself as a hunter in other, less expected, ways. If you want to be a wolf, he tells us, here is what to do: Go to a good school and study laissez-faire economics.Heres his interpretation of what was said to his class when it graduated: Youre about to leave Cambridge, gentlemen. Now, it may very well be true that the meek will inherit the earth, but my advice to you is this: Until they show some signs of making a serious bid for that position, trample all over them.As this quotation makes plain, this is not a typical nature book. Mr. Foster will go far out of his way to make a stray point, or especially to make a joke. He takes his topic seriously enough to hazard not being taken seriously at all.This book traffics in loathing as well as fear. Mr. Foster hates otters, for example. He describes them as wretched furry worms (invaders, not citizens) that bite off each others testicles. His dislike heats his prose up nicely.The closest he can legally get to being an otter, he says, is to stay up for a couple of nights, drinking a double espresso every couple of hours, before having a cold bath followed by a huge breakfast of still-twitching sushi and then a nap, and then keep repeating until I die.There are moments in this book when Mr. Foster is as antic as an otter. His whiskers get twitchy; he can try too hard to entertain. Such moments are relatively few. Being a Beast strikes me as an eccentric modern classic of nature writing. It is packed with wriggling pleasures.If the authors physical excursions put you in mind of the actor David Naughton running naked through the woods in An American Werewolf in London, his mental excursions are just as breathless. We happily follow him until he is, as he puts it near the end, a gnats breath away from psychosis."}
{"text": "ORLANDO, Fla.  With dozens of survivors of the massacre at a gay nightclub here still hospitalized, some of the wounded on Tuesday gave gripping accounts of terror and pain on a night that turned in an instant from joyous to deadly.The survivors told of fleeing, hiding, using their phones to plead for help, watching friends die  and thinking that they would also  as a man with an assault rifle and a handgun went through the Pulse nightclub, firing more shots than they could count. The slaughter early Sunday left 49 victims dead, in addition to the gunman, and 53 wounded  the worst mass shooting in American history.The guilt of feeling lucky to be alive is heavy, said Patience Carter, who was shot in the legs and saw her friend Akyra Murray killed. I was begging God to take the soul out of my body because I didnt want to feel any more pain, I didnt want any more shots.More than 30 of the wounded remained in hospitals on Tuesday, including at least six who were in critical condition. All of the dead had been identified, and most of the autopsies were completed.As the injured and the doctors who treated them told their stories, the F.B.I. continued looking into the actions of the gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, who died in a shootout with police, seeking evidence of a motive and any possible accomplices  in particular, whether his wife may have known he was planning the assault. His wife, Noor Zahi Salman, has told investigators that she once drove him to the nightclub, that she was with him when he bought ammunition, and that she tried to talk him out of mounting an attack, law enforcement officials said.Mr. Mateen had voiced hatred of gays, minorities and Jews, and had claimed links to Islamist terrorist groups; during the siege at the nightclub, he declared allegiance to the Islamic State. But investigators were also looking into reports that he might have been gay himself.His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, said that Mr. Mateen had told her that he had frequented nightclubs before their marriage, but had not described them as gay clubs.In Washington, President Obama on Tuesday reiterated that investigators had found no evidence that Mr. Mateen had actual contact with a larger terrorist group like the Islamic State.It is increasingly clear, however, that the killer took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet, Mr. Obama said. He appears to have been an angry, disturbed, unstable young man who became radicalized, the president said.These lone actors or small cells of terrorists are very hard to detect and very hard to prevent, Mr. Obama said. We are doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks.Referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the president said: I want to remind them that they are not alone. The American people and our allies, friends all over the world, stand with you and are thinking about you and are praying for you.On Sunday, there were about 320 people, most of them Latino, in Pulse shortly after 2 a.m. when Mr. Mateen entered with an assault rifle similar to an AR-15 and a semiautomatic handgun.Angel Colon was exchanging goodbye hugs with friends when the shooting began, and like much of the panicked crowd he ran for the door. But three bullets hit his leg and he fell.I tried to get back up but everyone started running everywhere  I got trampled over, and I shattered and broke my bones in my left leg, he said at Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he was being treated. All I could do was just lay down while everyone was just running on top of me, trying to get to where they had to be.He heard more gunshots and screaming as the gunman apparently went to a back room and then returned.Hes shooting everyone thats already dead on the floor, making sure theyre dead, Mr. Colon said. I look over, and he shoots the girl next to me. And Im just there laying down and Im thinking Im next, Im dead. So I dont know how, but by the glory of God, he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand, and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he wont know that Im alive.Then the killer traded gunfire with arriving police officers, retreating to another room. An officer entered, found Mr. Colon still alive, and dragged him through broken glass, cutting his back and legs, to the street and then to a nearby Wendys, where, he recalled,theres just bodies everywhere.I wish I could remember his face or his name, Mr. Colon said of the officer. Im grateful for him.Ms. Murray, 18, arrived in Orlando on Saturday from Philadelphia with her friends, Ms. Carter and Tiara Parker, on a trip to celebrate her high school graduation, and they had just ordered an Uber car to take them back to their hotel when they heard a barrage of gunfire. Ms. Carter said that she and Ms. Parker fled the club, then realized Ms. Murray was not with them and ran back inside to get her.By then, the way out was blocked, she said, and the three of them ran deeper into Pulse. Like a number of other people, including Angel Santiago Jr., they took shelter in a bathroom; several including Ms. Carter and her friends, cowered in a large handicapped stall. She and Mr. Santiago told their stories to reporters on Tuesday at Florida Hospital, where they were being treated.We just continued to hear gunfire, and I just remember thinking, when is it going to stop? Mr. Santiago said. It kept getting louder, closer, and I could actually start to smell, I dont know, I guess it was gunpowder.Then the gunman entered, spraying the room with bullets, aiming primarily at the walls of the toilet stalls.He was shooting his machine gun, so were all scrambling around the bathroom, screaming at the top of our lungs, Ms. Carter said. People were getting hit by bullets, blood is everywhere.A bullet went through her right thigh, shattering the femur, and lodged in her left thigh; both of her friends were also hit. Lying on the floor in a spreading pool of blood, she looked under the divider into the next stall.I could see piles of bodies laying over the toilet seat and slumped over, and the bottom of the toilet was slumped over with handprints and blood, she said. Turning her head in other directions, she saw more dead and wounded. At that point, I was just like, `I really dont think Im going to get out of here. Mr. Santiago was shot in the left foot and right knee, and the friend he was with was more seriously hurt. The gunman left the room, he said, and we were just trying to be as quiet as possible because we didnt want to attract him back to us.Unable to walk, Mr. Santiago dragged himself out of the bathroom, past prone and broken bodies, to the front room of the club, where he found police officers waiting. I yelled, I said, There are people shot, people who are killed in the bathroom, we need help, he recalled.Mr. Mateen returned to the bathroom, and it was there, Ms. Carter said, that he called 911 to talk with the police, and she heard him pledge allegiance to the Islamic State. He said that the reason why hes doing this is because he wants America to stop bombing his country.Later, he addressed his victims directly, asking if any of them were black, explaining: You know, I dont have a problem with black people. This is about my country. You guys have suffered enough.He got angry when peoples cellphones beeped or rang, and demanded that people turn them over, she said, and he made comments like weve got the snipers outside indicating that he was not alone, or that he was talking with accomplices.After a three-hour standoff, she heard explosions as the police started their final assault on the club, trying to blow a hole in an outer wall. His rifle had apparently jammed, she said, and he used the pistol to resume firing, shooting three people who lay on the floor. Someone  she did not know who  got between her and the gun, and was shot.It wasnt for that person shielding me, I would have been shot, I wouldnt be here, she said.Doctors at Orlando Regional Medical Center said they ordinarily would get some warning that wounded were coming, as well as information about the number of patients and their conditions. But not in this case, with a chaotic mass shooting just blocks away. Patients arrived in trucks and cars, and on foot, as well as in ambulances.We quickly got about five patients, and that was a lot for us, and we thought maybe that was going to be it, Dr. Kathryn Bondani said. And then they started lining up in the hallway.Forty-four patients were taken to the medical center, the regions only trauma center, and nine of them died quickly. No other patients have died since that night.Of the six patients in critical condition, Dr. Michael Cheatham said, I suspect that they will survive, but my concern is that they will have lasting harm from this, in terms of their functionality.On Monday night, thousands of people gathered on a grassy knoll in downtown Orlando for a candlelight vigil that was by turns defiant and melancholy.We have come together as a force here in Orlando that cannot be broken, said Terry DeCarlo, the executive director of the L.G.B.T. Center of Central Florida.Mourners joined in the sports chant: I believe that we will win.But moments later, during about 10 minutes of silence, tears flowed and embraces tightened as the crowd lifted candles into the air and a church bell tolled.Numb, Elayane Merriwether, a 25-year-old bartender who lost a co-worker in the shooting, said of the citys mood. People just keep crying. People dont know what to say to each other. I think a lot of people are still in shock."}

{"text": "It was one of George W. Bushs most viscerally powerful commercials against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race: a pack of wolves lurking in a forest as a narrator accused Mr. Kerry of slashing intelligence gathering against terrorists. Weakness attracts those who are waiting to do America harm, the ad warned, as the wolves started running toward the camera.Turns out the metaphor was subtle, at least by Donald J. Trumps standards.In his apocalyptic speech on Monday warning that terrorism could wipe out the United States  There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left, he said  Mr. Trump substituted Muslim immigrants for the wolf pack. A single gunman carried out the Orlando massacre, he said. Can you imagine what theyll do in large groups, which were allowing now to come here?Exploitation of fear has been part of the American political playbook since colonial pamphleteers whipped their neighbors into a frenzy over British misrule. It took on new potency in the nuclear age with Lyndon Johnsons Daisy ad against Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Jimmy Carters warnings about Ronald Reagans finger on the button in 1980.But Mr. Trump  who drew harsh condemnation from President Obama on Tuesday  has intensified the power of fear in presidential politics by demonizing an entire religious group. And he has expanded the use of that power by stirring up fear in the aftermath of national traumas, like the San Bernardino, Calif., attack and now the Orlando shooting, that traditionally elicited measured and soothing responses from political leaders.No more. Judging from his speech on Monday, his statements throughout the campaign, and interviews with historians and psychologists, Mr. Trump has committed himself to denigrating, if not steamrolling, the conditioned responses that have long served to help unite the country in times of crisis and offer Americans a chance to grieve and heal, and regain a sense of safety.At a time when other leaders would avoid divisive language and seek to unite both their admirers and detractors, as Mr. Bush did by visiting a mosque after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Trump appears wholly focused on the idea that America has reached an existential moment and that only he can save the country, a classic tactic of demagogy. The Orlando gunman, who was born in New York to Afghan immigrants, has given Mr. Trump his biggest opportunity yet to ask his own version of Reagans famous question from the 1980 presidential debates: Are you safer now than you were eight years ago?Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, said Mr. Trump was using the attack as an I-told-you-so moment. He would see this as a confirmation of all the things he has been saying about the threat the United States faces and the need to be more aggressive, he said.Professor Zelizer cast Mr. Trump as part of a political strain dating at least from the 1950s. When the United States is faced with national security threats or national security crises, you play to fear, you play to the anger of the electorate and you offer promises of military might as the solution, he said.In the jittery aftermath of a terrorist attack, people find themselves leaning on emotional reasoning, as opposed to thinking through these kinds of issues rationally, said Samuel Justin Sinclair, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and a co-author of The Psychology of Terrorism Fears.Its dangerous to think about making major policy decisions reactively and from a position of fear, Dr. Sinclair said.He added: Whether you agree with his politics or not, I think Mr. Trumps more aggressive tactics may be one attempt at trying to assert some level of control in a situation where people feel scared and a loss of control  as a means of helping them to feel safer. The dilemma then becomes whether supporting these more extreme policies justifies the ends  particularly in terms of how it changes us as a society.The 36 hours after the Orlando attack showcased a stark divergence between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton in going about an essential presidential task: leading in a time of crisis.Mr. Trump wasted no time in casting the massacre as evidence of the accuracy of his warnings about the threat America faced and the Obama administrations ineptitude. Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Though he also said he did not want to be congratulated, he issued a statement again patting himself on the back: Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen  and it is only going to get worse.And on CNN the next morning, he warned that Syrian refugees were going to cause big problems in the future, adding, Ive been a pretty good prognosticator as to whats going to be happening.Mr. Trump relied on a prepared text for his speech on Monday, and he lightly struck some of the more familiar notes often heard after tragedies: He said that the United States needed to respond to the attack as one united people and that it would remain a tolerant and open society.But he also argued that the determination of Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton not to use phrases like radical Islamic terrorism  which would surely antagonize Muslims  was tantamount to minimizing or ignoring tough truths about the enemy facing the United States and much of the West.The current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly, he said. Later, he added about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton: They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. I refuse to be politically correct.While Mr. Trump assailed Mrs. Clinton in his speech, Mrs. Clinton did not mention him by name in her own address on Monday.Laying out her plan to combat jihadists, Mrs. Clinton spoke of the gravity of the threat facing America but refrained from predicting doom. I have no doubt we can meet this challenge if we meet it together, she said.She warned against scapegoating and eroding trust. She pointedly said that the United States was not a land of winners and losers. And in calling for unity, she reached back to the Revolution, recalling how 13 squabbling colonies managed to join together.As I look at American history, I see that this has always been a country of we, not me, she said. We stand together because we are stronger together.To punctuate her point, Mrs. Clinton cited the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, recalling that Mr. Bush had warned against mistreating American Muslims.Lets make sure we keep looking to the best of our country, to the best within each of us, she said.Michael Signer, a Democratic activist and the author of Demagogue: The Fight to Save Democracy From Its Worst Enemies, lamented that the Orlando attack had afforded Mr. Trump a new opportunity to stoke fears. This was what we were all worried about, that some kind of national disaster would come along that would give him what he wants, he said.But some voters, after listening to Mrs. Clinton as well as Mr. Trump, said both of them were seizing on the massacre in Orlando for political purposes.I think those two are just using this as a way to push their campaigns ahead, said Rob Stecz, 34, who works in the health care industry in Chicago and is not planning to vote for either candidate.Clinton advisers argued emphatically that Mrs. Clinton was not exploiting Orlando but rather approaching the attack with nuance and avoiding simplistic conclusions or easy answers.Trump advisers, for their part, said Mr. Trump was simply leveling with the American people after eight years of mushy national security policy from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.But leveling with the American people can mean different things. The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin recalled that the aroused demagogic fear after Pearl Harbor had led to the internment of tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans during World War II  something Mr. Trump has said that, while he hated the idea, he might have supported at the time.Ms. Goodwin recalled the words of a young Japanese-American man from Seattle who had expressed shock at America as he was being herded off to a camp. If we continue down this demagogic path, she wrote in an email, millions of our citizens may well be asking a similar question: Is this the same America we have known?"}
{"text": "When the Mets arrived back at Citi Field on Tuesday afternoon, they were confronted with several notable changes since the last time they were home.To start, the outfield grass was discolored and cut up because of a series of Beyonc concerts here last week. Manager Terry Collins and his players inspected the jagged triangles in the outfield where new patches of sod had yet to take root and tested how the ball might bounce off the seams.The lineup was also conspicuously different. Kelly Johnson, acquired from the Atlanta Braves last Wednesday, moved back into his old locker in the corner of the Mets clubhouse and was playing second base. Neil Walker and Michael Conforto were on the bench because of injuries, a development that had General Manager Sandy Alderson fielding questions before the game about how active the Mets might be in upgrading their offense before the trade deadline.Nature dictates that the grass should eventually grow into form. The Mets offense, however, showed no signs of a breakout, their bats silenced in a 4-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.Our lineup is what it is because thats what we have, Collins said after the game. Im not going to sit here and complain about it. Weve got to get it done.Jameson Taillon, in his second major league start, defused the Mets lineup, allowing two hits in eight innings. The Mets first hit did not come until Curtis Granderson led off the seventh with a single.When Taillon woke Tuesday morning, he was a member of the Pirates Class AAA affiliate in Indianapolis. By dusk, a confluence of events had led him to the Citi Field mound.After Juan Nicasio threw 44 pitches in relief Friday, effectively making him unavailable for his scheduled start Tuesday, the Pirates placed Gerrit Cole on the disabled list with a right triceps strain to make room for Taillon.Tommy John surgery and a sports hernia had delayed Taillons major league debut until last Wednesday, when he threw six solid innings against the Mets at PNC Park.In his first road start, Taillon looked much more like a cant-miss prospect, even against a diluted Mets lineup.He pitched like a big leaguer, Collins said.Carried by a mischievous curveball and an active fastball, Taillon retired the first seven batters he faced. Kevin Plawecki was hit by a pitch, and Taillon walked Yoenis Cespedes in the fourth inning, but otherwise the Mets offense was neutralized. Of the 24 outs collected while Taillon was on the mound, only one came on a fly ball to the outfield.Despite Taillons brilliance, a more distressing takeaway for the Mets was their inability to make solid contact in the game. Taillon was not overpowering  he struck out five  and after having pitched last week against the Mets, he was not a complete mystery either.Taillon did not try to confuse the Mets early. He threw all fastballs in the first inning, but the Mets were muted nonetheless.It started out as establishing the fastball, and then they never really adjusted too well off of that, Taillon said. I was commanding it well. I was throwing a lot of two-seams, getting good movement, weak contact. I didnt really need to get away from it.Jacob deGrom was almost as stifling, shutting the Pirates out for the first five innings. But with two outs in the sixth, he allowed a single to Starling Marte, and Jung Ho Kang sent a fly ball over the center-field wall for the first two runs of the game.Other than that, I felt good out there, deGrom said. I think that was probably the best Ive felt on the mound. All my pitches were working. Its kind of frustrating to feel that good and end up giving up two.Marte added a two-run homer of his own in the eighth inning off reliever Jim Henderson.Taillon had only 91 pitches through eight innings, but he had not pitched past the seventh inning all season. Given Taillons injury history, Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle cautioned against letting him finish the game.While the Mets struggle with the uncertainty of assembling a potent lineup in the near future, the Pirates hope that this is just the beginning for Taillon.If he doesnt throw a complete-game shutout the rest of his career, Hurdle said, Ill wear this one to my grave."}
{"text": "Iran has reached an agreement with the Boeing Company for the acquisition of new passenger planes to help modernize its outdated fleet, state-run Iranian news media reported on Tuesday.Such an agreement, if completed, would potentially be worth many billions of dollars to Boeing and amount to the most prominent commercial transaction between an American company and Iran since sanctions linked to Irans nuclear program were lifted six months ago. It also would send a strong signal that Iran and the United States, despite decades of antipathy, might be moving toward normalized ties.Numerous obstacles remain to such an agreement, most notably other American sanctions on Iran that are not related to the Tehrans nuclear program, including a ban on using dollars in trade with the country. The restraints have dissuaded many international banks and financial companies, fearful of running afoul of American laws, from venturing into the Iranian market.Many Republican lawmakers and others who opposed the nuclear agreement, and who have long warned of any reconciliation with Iran, could object to a Boeing deal.Also unclear is whether Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who often describes the United States as his countrys most dangerous threat, would countenance such an agreement.Nonetheless, Boeing, with the United States governments permission, has been in discussions for months with Iranian aviation officials about their dire needs for new airplanes.Iranian officials have said they will need to acquire at least 400 planes in coming years to replace their commercial fleet, one of the worlds oldest. It includes some Boeing models that predate the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah.Irans minister of roads and urban development, Abbas Akhoundi, was quoted by Iranian news agencies on Tuesday as saying that a deal with Boeing had been completed and that details would be announced within the next few days.Asked about Mr. Akhoundis assertion, a spokesman for Boeing at the companys Chicago headquarters, John Dern, did not deny it.In an emailed response, Mr. Dern said, We do not discuss details of ongoing conversations we are having with customers, and our standard practice is to let customers announce any agreements that are reached.Mr. Derns statement also cautioned: Any agreements reached will be contingent on U.S. government approval.Boeings most important foreign competitor, Airbus, announced a deal worth roughly $27 billion in January to sell Iran 118 aircraft. There has been speculation that Boeing has been negotiating a similar transaction involving roughly 100 planes.But the Airbus agreement has not been completed, partly because it also requires United States regulatory approval since a significant portion of Airbus plane components are American.Asked about the status of the Airbus deal, a spokesman, Justin Dubon, said in an emailed response, As with any agreement, it takes some time to finalize.Some American critics of Iran expressed skepticism about the Iranian reports of a Boeing deal, describing them as an exaggeration and part of what they called Irans attempts to portray itself as a legitimate economic partner.These deals are more aspirational than a reality, said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that is highly critical of Iran.Mr. Dubowitz said aircraft deals with Iran were tricky in part because some areas of the countrys civilian aviation industry were controlled by Iranian businesses linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which remain subject to American sanctions.Its a due-diligence nightmare, he said, not just for the companies but for the banks that finance the deals.At the same time, Mr. Dubowitz and others also noted that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, an architect of the nuclear agreement, will be up for re-election next year and needs to show that the agreement has been economically beneficial.Under that agreement, completed in January with the United States and other world powers, many economic restraints on Iran were rescinded or relaxed in exchange for verifiable guarantees by Iran that it is engaged in only peaceful atomic work.Mr. Rouhanis promised benefits, however, have been slow in coming. Iranian officials have complained that nonnuclear American sanctions remain a major impediment, dissuading many foreign companies from investing in and trading with Iran.The Boeing deal would be really important, said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consulting company.Proponents of the nuclear deal, Mr. Kupchan said, have been wagering that it will help Iran evolve in a direction less hostile to the United States and other Western powers.For that, Iranian elites have to know that the U.S. wants constructive interaction, he said. If Boeing sells 100 planes to Iran, it would send exactly the right vibe.United Against Nuclear Iran, a New-York based advocacy organization, has claimed some responsibility for Irans frustration, through a campaign that warns companies that they could risk incurring American legal problems by engaging in business with Iranian entities.The organization claimed responsibility for the cancellation of an international forum on opportunities in Irans natural gas industry that had been scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Barcelona, Spain.Anthony Bright, operations manager for INconnect, a Czech company that had organized the forum, said in an emailed statement that it had been postponed until December. Mr. Bright did not provide a reason."}
{"text": "Twitter has invested about $70 million in the streaming music service SoundCloud in a deal that may help both companies attract more users.Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive, confirmed that the companys investment in a statement to the technology news site Recode on Tuesday.He did not specify the amount, and a spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment. But the figure was confirmed by a person who had been briefed on the deal.Earlier this year, we made an investment in SoundCloud through Twitter Ventures to help support some of our efforts with creators, Mr. Dorsey said. Theyve been great partners of ours over the years, and their community-supported approach mirrors ours in many ways.The deal will mean needed funds for SoundCloud, which has struggled with losses despite establishing itself as a popular online outlet for new music. It could clarify how Twitter deals with entertainment, an area in which the company has stumbled in the past.SoundCloud opened in 2008 and became a favorite of musicians and fans, attracting what it says are 175 million users worldwide. At the same time, the company drew the ire of the major record labels for hosting unlicensed content, which made it vulnerable to copyright liability.In 2014, Twitter considered buying SoundCloud, but abandoned the deal. Since then, SoundCloud has struck new licensing deals with record companies and publishers, helping to legitimize the service with the mainstream music business.In March, SoundCloud introduced its long-promised subscription service, SoundCloud Go, making a catalog of more than 125 million songs available to people at $10 a month, with a free version supported by advertising.In SoundClouds financial filings for 2014, released early this year, the company reported $19.5 million in revenue but a loss of almost $44 million, and said it would need to raise money to stay in business. Last year, it raised $77 million in debt.In a statement, a SoundCloud spokeswoman said the investment from Twitter would enable SoundCloud to remain focused on building value for creators and listeners alike."}

{"text": "MENLO PARK, Calif.  When Carrie Simmons opened her Facebook app one day in late 2014, she saw a status update from a high school friend she had not seen in years that alarmed her. It read like a suicide note.Thank you for everyone who tried to help me, Ms. Simmonss friend, whom she declined to name, wrote.Ms. Simmons immediately called a mutual friend, a police officer, who reached out to the local authorities in their friends town in California. There, the police found the friend in a parked car with a pistol in his lap. He did not pull the trigger and is alive today.If I hadnt already been educated in suicide prevention or hadnt seen the post on Facebook, I dont know that I would have picked up the phone and known to call, said Ms. Simmons, who is a real estate broker in Seattle.With more than 1.65 billion members worldwide posting regularly about their behavior, Facebook is planning to take a more direct role in stopping suicide. On Tuesday, in the biggest step by a major technology company to incorporate suicide prevention tools into its platform, the social network introduced mechanisms and processes to make it easier for people to help friends who post messages about suicide or self-harm. With the new features, people can flag friends posts that they deem suicidal; the posts will be reviewed by a team at the social network that will then provide language to communicate with the person who is at risk, as well as information on suicide prevention.The timing coincides with a surge in suicide rates in the United States  to a 30-year high. The increase has been particularly steep among women and middle-aged Americans, reflecting widespread desperation. Last year, President Obama declared a World Suicide Prevention Day in September, calling on people to recognize mental health issues early and to reach out to support one another.Facebook has long thrust itself into major societal debates because of its vast reach and the enormous diversity of human behavior it sees. About 72 percent of Americans  and 77 percent of American women  use Facebook, according to a 2015 study by Pew Research.Yet Facebook is walking a tightrope, trying to explore its role as an arbiter of social change without upsetting the hundreds of millions of people who regularly use its services. Some of the suicide prevention tools may trouble groups that have concerns about digital privacy. Many of those groups have already become wary of what they see as Facebooks overreach in peoples personal lives.In October 2014, the company was embroiled in a scandal after it emerged that Facebook researchers used its news feed feature to try to manipulate the emotions of its users. The incident resulted in an overhaul of its user research methodology. Last month, Facebook grappled with accusations of political bias and fears about how much it could influence the views of its members.The company really has to walk a fine line here, said Dr. Jennifer Stuber, an associate professor at the University of Washington and the faculty director of Forefront, a suicide prevention organization. They dont want to be perceived as Big Brother-ish, because people are not expecting Facebook to be monitoring their posts.Facebook said it had a role to play in helping its users to help one another. About a third of the posts shared on the site include some form of negative feelings, according to a study released in February by the companys researchers. Posts with negative associations tended to receive longer, more empathetic comments from Facebook friends, the company said.Given that Facebook is the place youre connected to friends and family, it seemed like a natural fit, said Dr. Jennifer Guadagno, a researcher at Facebook who is leading the suicide prevention project. Facebook has a team of more than a dozen engineers and researchers dedicated to the project.Facebooks new suicide prevention tools start with a drop-down menu that lets people report posts, a feature that was previously available only to some English-speaking users. People across the world can now flag a message as one that could raise concern about suicide or self-harm; those posts will then come to the attention of Facebooks global community operations team, a group of hundreds of people around the world who monitor flagged posts 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Posts flagged as potential self-harm notes are to be expedited and reviewed more quickly by the team members, who also examine posts that Facebook users have reported as objectionable. Community operations team members who evaluate potentially suicidal content are given special training, Facebook said.The person reporting a suicide note is given a menu of options, including the ability to send a Facebook message directly to the friend in distress or to a mutual friend to coordinate help. Facebook will provide a suggested text message to send, or users can fill in their own words.People really want to help, but often they just dont know what to say, what to do or how to help their friends, said Vanessa Callison-Burch, a Facebook product manager working on the project. Users are also provided with a list of resources, including help lines and suicide prevention material, that they can click through to gain access.If Facebook evaluators believe a post is a call for help or a distress signal, the person whose message was reported will be presented with a similar list of options the next time that person logs into Facebook and view the news feed, including tips and resources on what to do if the person feels suicidal. Such people are also prompted to reach out to friends who may be able to support them on Facebook.The company said its work on suicide prevention started about 10 years ago, after a number of suicides in Palo Alto, Calif., the former location of Facebooks headquarters and the city in which Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, lives. Palo Altos two public high schools have suicide rates between four and five times the national average.Over the past year, Facebook has conducted a small test with suicide prevention tools in some countries, in conjunction with outside entities like Forefront, NowMattersNow.org and Save.org, a group of suicide prevention organizations. The company declined to share data on the early results.Theyve been very reluctant to release data on the project, even to partners like us, because of the privacy issues, said Dr. Stuber of the University of Washington.Facebook is becoming more forthcoming on other internal practices and how it conducts user research. On Tuesday, in a move separate from the suicide prevention tools, Facebook laid out its research review methods in a study conducted by two of its researchers. The company is hoping that the study, which is being published in Washington and Lee Law Review, will be used by other academics to help with their research methodologies.Some nonprofit organizations and researchers that have pushed Facebook to be more aggressive in its suicide prevention efforts hope the changes push other tech giants to act similarly.Were losing more people to suicide than breast cancer, car accidents, homicides, said Dr. Dan Reidenberg, the executive director of Save.org. Wed be fortunate for other companies to get on the bandwagon."}
{"text": "The punishing rents of New York City breed unusual compromises. Sophomore year of college, I snagged a one-bedroom at the top of a seventh-floor walk-up in Lower Manhattan. The week I moved in, a neighbor pulled me aside and offered wisdom on the climb: Your legs will get used to it, she said, but your heart never will. How literally she meant this, I was never sure.The apartment was tiny  I had to shuffle sideways like a crab to get into my bathroom  and I was intent on justifying the unreasonable rent. So the day before I moved in, I ordered a bunk bed on Amazon. I figured that with an extra berth, I could effectively double the apartments holding capacity, allow out-of-towners to avoid hotels and offer refuge for friends, whether locked out of their own homes or weary of the slog back to Brooklyn.The bed arrived as a sprawl of metal poles, each embalmed in white lacquer. I had picked a model with a full-size bed on bottom and a twin on top. While a traditional twin-on-twin evokes the accommodations of childhood and camp, prison and the military  a sign, somehow, of both playfulness and austerity  the twin-over-full variety signals something entirely different, and possibly even transgressive. Instead of two sleepers, the bed seemed to beckon heterodox groupings of three or four.Most evenings, the bunk bed offered itself up as a choice. Did I want to transcend worldly concerns, swaddled and suspended in a criblike twin bed that enveloped my lanky build? Or did I prefer to brave the open expanse of the full bed like a taxpaying adult? The decision involved a touch of foresight. The bed was wedged against three walls, and waking up on the twin meant either shimmying down the ladder (and having my ribs played like a xylophone by the rungs) or taking a morning death-leap from the top, more invigorating than a cup of coffee.During the trial run, close friends took the bottom, and I, rather religiously, took the top. I was convinced I would be horribly maimed should the contraption collapse  Please! You take the bottom, I insisted, shrouding my dread in panicked largess. But once the lights were off, youthful exchanges about life, love and the cosmos raged. We were recumbent along an intimate vertical axis, and our words, unmarred by dubious glances, spilled into the air. All night, the whoosh of cars outside echoed through the room like waves against a hull; until sleep finally took us, we were out at sea together, stowed away safely.The bed swiftly earned its claim to being one of my most prized possessions. Then, my parents came to visit.One evening, I left the apartment to pick up milk for the mornings cereal. When I returned, they were absent from the living room, and the bedroom door was closed. I opened the door, and I regret it, as those who open doors so often do. My parents, stumbling through a defense, confessed that the bunk bed had sparked dormant passions  the beds latticework of metal poles both the kindling and the match that ignited their love aflame. Freuds primal scene is supposedly a trauma specific to childhood, but I am now no longer sure.In the years to follow, the bed exerted something like a centripetal force on the space. Nearly all memorable activity in the apartment spiraled around it. Regardless of how close any two (or more) people are beforehand, on bunks they fall asleep together, they wake up together, they hear each other sleeping (snoring, babbling, rolling around). Each person is made to be vulnerable before the other, and in doing so bonds in an unusual and meaningful way. The twin-over-full arrangement did not militate against the orgiastic, as my parents had proved, but much more often, it fostered friendship.In the summer, small, boozy gatherings in the apartment migrated to the air-conditioned bedroom. As many as six of us would distribute ourselves across the beds, and occasionally someone would be dispatched to the bottom bunk if the metal moaned too much under our weight. Treasured memories of childhood mischief and sleepaway camp inevitably surfaced, cementing new friendships and shedding light on old ones.Each morning when visitors were below, I craned my neck over the side of the safety railing to check on them. Some consulted my eyes, as if inquiring about what was in store for breakfast; others instinctively reached out a hand to meet mine halfway. Even though the bed proved to be reliably sturdy, I was always delighted to find that no one perished in the night, that no limbs and organs were compromised by loose screws or buckled metal.Word eventually got around campus, and the questions kept finding me: Is it true that you have a bunk bed? Does it really have a full and a twin? I had bought the thing in the name of economy, but it had become an attraction in itself. Perhaps bunk beds, in an age of individuation, tap into our latent desire to share a world  they urge us, after all, to cohabitate, and to explore the pleasures and challenges of unfamiliar intimacies."}
{"text": "Gregory Rabassa, a distinguished translator from Spanish and Portuguese who brought the work of luminaries like Gabriel Garca Mrquez and Mario Vargas Llosa to a wide English-speaking public, died on Monday in Branford, Conn. He was 94.His family confirmed the death.A longtime faculty member of Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Professor Rabassa was widely considered one of the foremost translators of any kind in the world. He was known in particular for making the wave of dynamic and powerful fiction, much of it magic realist, that emerged in Latin America in the 1960s and afterward  a literary phenomenon known there as El Boom  accessible in English.Foremost among those novels was One Hundred Years of Solitude, Mr. Garca Mrquezs epochal multigenerational saga, first published in the authors native Colombia in 1967. Professor Rabassas critically acclaimed translation, issued in the United States in 1970, marked the inaugural appearance in English of both the novel and its author.The novel, in Professor Rabassas rendering, became a best seller. Mr. Garca Mrquez, who publicly described Professor Rabassa as the best Latin American writer in the English language, received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.Writing in The New York Times, John Leonard reviewed One Hundred Years of Solitude  which centers on the fortunes of the mythical South American town of Macondo and includes such spectacularly routine phenomena as ghosts, mass insomnia and tumbling clouds of butterflies  calling it superbly translated.He further called the novel, in an encomium that speaks to the translators skill as well as the authors, a cathedral of words, perceptions and legends that amounts to the declaration of a state of mind.Professor Rabassas other Spanish-to-English work includes the Argentine writer Julio Cortzars novel Hopscotch, for which he won a National Book Award for translation in 1967; The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, by Mr. Vargas Llosa, a native of Peru; and Mr. Garca Mrquezs Leaf Storm and Other Stories and The Autumn of the Patriarch.From the Portuguese, he translated the work of the Brazilian writers Jorge Amado, Clarice Lispector and Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis and the Portuguese writer Antnio Lobo Antunes.Professor Rabassa was also a masterly commentator on the singular pleasures and perils of the translators art. He enumerated them in 2005 in a memoir, If This Be Treason: Translation and Its Dyscontents, whose subtitle reflects the etymological underpinnings of that curiously spelled word.His renown in the field was even more striking in that he had never intended to become a translator at all.The son of Miguel Rabassa, a sugar broker from Cuba, and the former Clara Macfarland, a New Yorker, Gregory Luis Rabassa was born in Yonkers on March 9, 1922. He was reared on a farm in Hanover, N.H., where his father, after the decline of the Cuban sugar market in the 1920s, had become a hotelier.Wishing to assimilate, his father used English almost exclusively. He only spoke Spanish when he cut himself, Professor Rabassa told an interviewer in 2007.But Gregory Rabassa fell in love with the language as an undergraduate at Dartmouth, from which he earned a bachelors degree in Romance languages. He went on to earn a masters in Spanish and a doctorate in Portuguese, both from Columbia.In World War II he served with the Office of Strategic Services as a cryptographer in Italy and North Africa.Professor Rabassa planned to pursue a life of quiet scholarship. He taught at Columbia from the late 1940s to the late 1960s, when he joined the Queens faculty, from which he retired in 2007.In the early 60s, he edited Odyssey Review, a literary journal featuring new writing from Europe and Latin America. His English translations in its pages came to the attention of an editor at Pantheon Books, who asked him to render Mr. Cortzars Hopscotch, about an Argentine exiles search for the meaning of existence, into English.Mr. Cortzar was so pleased with the result that he told Mr. Garca Mrquez to commandeer Professor Rabassa for One Hundred Years of Solitude.To build his cathedrals of words, Professor Rabassa required scant raw materials: The book, a dictionary, a pile of paper, as he told The Times in 1981.Labor was another matter. It is the translators lot to be afflicted with chronic, Talmudic agonizing  over sound, over sense, over meter, over meaning. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, for instance, the torment began with the first word of the title.In Spanish, the novel is called Cien Aos de Soledad, with cien meaning 100.But theres the rub, for the translator into English confronts an instant quandary: whether to translate cien as a hundred or one hundred.Professor Rabassa was an ardent believer in the aurality of text. To him, a was an acoustic flyspeck, little more than a fleeting grunt. He chose the more durable one.The novels famous opening sentence wrought compound agonies. The original reads, Muchos aos despus, frente al pelotn de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buenda haba de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llev a conocer el hielo.In If This Be Treason, Professor Rabassa traced his path through the web of contingencies that ensued, starting with the phrase pelotn de fusilamiento:There are variant possibilities, he wrote. In the British Army it would have been a firing party, which I rather like, but I was writing for American readers. He added:I chose remember over recall because I feel that it conveys a deeper memory. Remote might have aroused thoughts of such inappropriate things as remote control and robots. Also, I liked distant when used with time.Confronting the devilish verb conocer, Professor Rabassa continued:The word seen straight means to know a person or thing for the first time, to meet someone, to be familiar with something. What is happening here is a first-time meeting, or learning. It can also mean to know something more deeply than saber, to know from experience. Garca Mrquez has used the Spanish word here with all its connotations. But to know ice just wont do in English. It implies, How do you do, ice? It could be to experience ice. The first is foolish, the second is silly. When you get to know something for the first time, youve discovered it. Only after that can you come to know it in the full sense.The evocative published result: Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buenda was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.Among the other authors Professor Rabassa translated, with their attendant pleasurable torments, were Miguel ngel Asturias, the Guatemalan writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1967, and the Spaniard Juan Benet.Professor Rabassa had homes in Manhattan and Hampton Bays, on Long Island. His first marriage, to Roney Edelstein, ended in divorce. His survivors include his second wife, the former Clementine Christos, whom he married in 1966; a daughter, Kate Rabassa Wallen, from his first marriage; another daughter, Clara Rabassa, from his second; and two grandchildren.His other honors include the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation, the Wheatland Prize for Translation, the Alexander Gode Medal from the American Translators Association and the National Medal of Arts.For all his acclaim, Professor Rabassa disavowed reviewers accounts of his linguistic prowess: It was the skill of the author, he insisted, that had half the battle won for him before he took up his pen.If its a good book, he told The Times in 1974, the translator has to be a butcher to kill it. If its a great book, even a clown can make it come true."}
{"text": "The nation hasnt exactly joined hands in a united response to the Orlando massacre. But since this terrible mass shooting happened in one of the most weapons-friendly places in the country, maybe we can at least all agree that having wildly permissive gun laws does not make a city safer.O.K., probably not.On Wednesday, Donald Trump took time out from vilifying Muslims and put some of the blame on gun control. If the patrons of Pulse, the gay bar in Orlando, had been carrying concealed weapons, he said, they could have taken control of the situation. The gunman would have been just open target practice.(This was at the same speech where he congratulated himself for his stupendous relationship with the gay community, suggesting he didnt get enough credit for having a club in Palm Beach that was open to everybody. This is a little off our topic today, but I have to once again point out that Trumps club is open to everybody with $100,000 to cover the membership fee.)But about guns. Lets follow Trumps thought. Its easy to buy a gun in Florida and supereasy to get a permit to carry around a concealed weapon. Even the Florida Legislature, however, doesnt allow people to carry guns into bars. Trump did not specifically say that we need to uphold Americans freedom to drink while armed. But there doesnt seem to be any other way to interpret his argument.Also, there actually was an off-duty police officer working in the club who tried to shoot the gunman but failed. This is important, because the myth of the cool and steady shooter is one of the most cherished beliefs of the National Rifle Association and its supporters. Trump himself has bragged that if hed been in Paris on the night of the attacks there, he would have shot the terrorists. (I may have been killed, but I would have drawn.)This is an excellent example of delusional gun thinking. Although Trump frequently reminds us he has a permit to carry a gun, theres no indication hes ever done so. And theres certainly no evidence whatsoever that he has any skill in hitting things.Its very, very difficult to draw, aim and shoot accurately when youre under severe stress. Its one of the reasons that police officers so often spray fleeing suspects with bullets. They cant hit a moving target, even though they get far more weapons training than your normal armed civilian.In Florida, people who want to carry a gun merely have to be able to demonstrate they can safely handle and discharge the firearm. Nowhere does it say anything about accuracy.A few weeks ago in Houston, a 25-year-old Afghan war veteran named Dionisio Garza walked up to a stranger sitting in a car at a carwash and shot him in the neck while railing about homosexuals, Jews and Walmart, according to local reports. He fired off 212 rounds, mostly from an assault rifle, hitting a police helicopter and a nearby gas station, which burst into flames. The police said a neighbor who heard the shooting came running with a gun, but was shot himself.People who hear this story may draw different morals. The way weve been going, itll be a miracle if some member of the Texas Legislature doesnt submit a bill requiring employees of carwashes to be armed at all times. However, others might note that the weapon in this case was an AR-15, the same type of military-style rifle that was used in the Orlando shooting, the Newtown school shooting and the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. It would seem as if the best way to cut down on mass shootings would be by eliminating weapons that allow crazy people to rapidly fire off endless rounds of bullets.The possibility of banning assault weapons like the AR-15 is most definitely not on the table in Congress, although Hillary Clinton supports it, and has brought it up a lot since Orlando. No, the current debate in Washington is over whether people on the governments terror watch list should be kept from purchasing arms.The fact that even people who arent allowed to get on a plane can buy a gun in this country is obviously insane. Yet most of the Republicans in the House and the Senate regard changing the status quo as an enormous lift. I think youre going too far here, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told the backers during one of the bills pathetic trips to nowhere.Since the Orlando shooter had actually spent some time on the terror watch list, the pressure seems to be growing. Trump says hell meet with the N.R.A. to talk over the matter. Perhaps, after all this time, well get some pathetically minor action. Then only apolitical maniacs would have the opportunity to buy guns that can take out a roomful of people in no time flat."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, testifying in a closely watched copyright trial on Wednesday, said that until recently he had never heard the song he has been accused of plagiarizing in the bands 1971 hit Stairway to Heaven.A couple of years ago, Mr. Page said, his son-in-law told him that people online were comparing Stairway to Taurus, a 1968 song by the lesser-known group Spirit. But when Mr. Page finally heard the other song, it sounded totally alien to him.I know that I had never heard it before, he said.Mr. Page, 72, and his bandmate Robert Plant, 67, are defending themselves in the music industrys latest copyright trial, a year after Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay $5.3 million to the family of Marvin Gaye over their song Blurred Lines.The suit over Stairway to Heaven was filed by Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the songs of Randy Wolfe, a member of Spirit, who died in 1997. The suit says that Mr. Page and Mr. Plant copied Taurus for the distinctive acoustic guitar part that opens Stairway, and that the men had heard Spirits song when the two bands crossed paths on the road.At the trial, which began Tuesday, lawyers for Led Zeppelin are expected to argue that any similarities between Stairway to Heaven and Taurus are because of generic musical patterns that cannot be copyrighted, like a descending chord progression that is common to both pieces.Mr. Page, who appeared in a black three-piece suit with his long white hair tied back, was asked by Mr. Skidmores lawyer whether he remembered a concert in December 1968 when Led Zeppelin opened for Spirit.I didnt hear Spirit at the Denver show, Mr. Page said, adding that he believed the headliner was Vanilla Fudge.Mr. Page admitted that he owned a copy of Spirits 1968 debut album, which contains the song Taurus, although he said he did not know how he got it. His record collection contains 4,329 vinyl albums and 5,882 CDs, he said.Earlier in the day, Mark Andes, the bassist in Spirit, testified that Taurus had been a regular part of the bands set in its early days. He said he remembered drinking beer and playing snooker with Mr. Plant after Spirit played a club in Birmingham, England, in 1970.We had a blast, Mr. Andes said.With its accusation of plagiarism in one of the most famous and lucrative songs in rock history  according to one estimate, the song has generated more than $562 million in royalties  the case has riveted the music industry, and the courtroom was packed with reporters and fans.The day had moments of levity, as when Mr. Page told the plaintiffs lawyer, Francis Malofiy, that he had begun playing guitar at age 12 and was in professional recording sessions by 17.You had a gift, you played the guitar, Mr. Malofiy said.Well, yeah, Mr. Page said, to laughter in the courtroom.His testimony is expected to continue on Thursday."}
{"text": "SHANGHAI  It has been a roller coaster ride.Six days ago, Robert A. Iger, Disneys chief executive, was on a high, beaming as he guided reporters around the soon-to-open Shanghai Disneyland. Then came the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., home to Walt Disney World. Mr. Iger responded by tightening security at that resort, releasing a statement expressing heartbreak and clearing a $1 million donation for shooting victims.But the show in Shanghai went on. At a festive event on Tuesday night to celebrate the start of an all-Mandarin version of Disneys Lion King stage musical, Mr. Iger was surrounded by giddy lieutenants who had flown in for the party. The Champagne flowed freely. The next morning, a relaxed-looking Mr. Iger stood on the parks Tarzan stage for a news conference attended by roughly 800 journalists from around the world.By Wednesday afternoon, however, more grim news from Florida cast a pall all the way to China: An alligator had dragged a toddler into a lake at a Disney World hotel. After a search, authorities announced that the boy was presumed dead. After the body of the child was discovered, Mr. Iger said from Shanghai in a statement, As a parent and a grandparent, my heart goes out to the Graves family during this time of devastating loss.It was probably for the best that Wednesday nights unveiling of the Shanghai Disneyland nightly fireworks show, Ignite the Dream! A Nighttime Spectacular of Magic and Light, was canceled because of a rainstorm.The opening celebration will resume on Thursday morning with a formal park dedication, attended by senior Chinese officials, in front of the parks centerpiece castle, the largest and tallest (197 feet) Disney has ever built. At noon Shanghai time, Disneys sixth resort, its first on the Chinese mainland, will officially open to the public.If there was not enormous pressure before to make certain that Thursdays ceremony comes off without a hitch, there certainly is now.For Mr. Iger, 65, the opening of the 963-acre Shanghai Disney Resort is extremely personal. He started seeking approvals in the 1990s and now has direct relationships with people like Han Zheng, the Communist Party secretary in Shanghai. In May, Chinas president, Xi Jinping, sat with Mr. Iger in a public meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing  a rarely granted privilege that seemed to telegraph his personal approval of the arrival of a singular American brand.The resort is majority-owned by a Chinese state-controlled consortium, but the profit potential for Disney remains nothing short of spectacular, analysts say. Disney holds a 43 percent stake in the park, where a single-day adult ticket costs $75 on weekends and holidays, a substantial price in China, and $56 on nonpeak days. That compares with $125 and $105 at Disney World in Florida. Disney will receive a commensurate slice of merchandise and food sales. It also will receive a fee for its role in managing the resort and royalties for the use of its characters.Moreover, the company expects Shanghai Disneyland to increase interest across China for its movies, toys, clothes, television shows, video games and books."}
{"text": "MILAN  The common element to the eclectic group of works that Sam Havadtoy created for his exhibit Only Remember the Future at the Mudima Foundation here is not immediately noticeable to the eye.Overpainted so it isnt visible, lace envelops his paintings and sculptures like a delicately patterned second skin. It is a subtle reminder that despite a peripatetic life that at one point brought him to New York, where he was Yoko Onos companion for two decades after John Lennons death in 1980, Mr. Havadtoys roots are Hungarian.In Hungary, Mr. Havadtoy said, you find lace on the top of the TV, on the back of the armchair, on the sofa, everywhere. But once it gets soiled or ripped it gets thrown away because it is seen as something of little value, a bit kitschy, rather than one of the earliest forms of female art and a time-intensive craft that dates back at least to ancient Egypt.I thought by putting it on canvases or statues, the viewer is confronted with something that they never knew as a source of beauty in their lives, Mr. Havadtoy said during a stroll through the exhibit, which opened June 1 and runs through July 8.Lace has become such a signature of Mr. Havadtoys work that visitors to his shows often bring him treasured lace heirlooms, so that they might live a second life in his art.Mr. Havadtoy primes his canvases with handwritten personal stories that are then buried under layers of paint and lace so that they cannot be read. He described the process as a confession that no one hears.So the lace is a ritual, the final act of that story, moving on from that story, he said.As a storyteller, Mr. Havadtoy, 63, is at no loss for anecdotes. Born in London and raised in communist Hungary, he escaped through the Iron Curtain into Yugoslavia and on to Italy. From there he traveled to London. In the summer of 1972, he moved to New York to join a boyfriend and prospered as an interior designer until an encounter with Lennon and Ms. Ono steered his life in a new direction.The couple came into the shop where he worked and selected two chairs. I was included in the price, he recalled with a laugh.I am the kind of person that if I see a door, I want to open it, he said, walking around an installation titled Doors, a series of painted antique doors with the handles replaced by bulbous bronze self-portraits that he described as my version of the 14 stations of the cross.It is a nod to the deeply rooted  if rarely followed  religious tradition of his newly adopted home, Italy, as well as a rumination on the trials we go through in life.In this show, his own have been painstakingly written, concealed and consigned to posterity on canvases that pay a post-pointillist nod to Italian masters like Umberto Boccioni, Modigliani and Giorgio Morandi.His association with Keith Haring, Andy Warhol and other luminaries of the New York art scene of the last decades of the 20th century might have informed his artistic development, but finding his own vision was complicated by his involvement with Ms. Ono, one of the worlds most recognized female artists. He only began making art full time in the mid-1980s, he said.That said, Ms. Ono was an undoubted influence.Being with Yoko was like going through an extensive university course of life, he said. And I was the only student.I may have taken too long, he added. Maybe I failed at many courses, but finally I graduated and came into my own. Like going to university, its a period that you would never replace with anything else, but theres no point in going back to it, its done.After their breakup in 2000  which he described as painful  Mr. Havadtoy moved to England and then back to Hungary, where he set up a studio in a town outside Budapest. Seven years ago he began visiting Italy more frequently, moving first to Liguria and then to Milan, where he now lives, commuting to Budapest.Hes authentic, said Arturo Schwarz, an Italian art historian and curator.A real artist must be faithful to his inner self, and his art is very personal, said Mr. Schwarz, who wrote an essay in the catalogue for Mr. Havadtoys show at Mudima. Its his own inner world; hes sincere and truthful to himself.Since moving to Italy, Mr. Havadtoy said his mood  and his art  have become happier and his production has flourished. Just this year he will have shows in Milan, Budapest, Warsaw and Brussels. The Milan exhibition will travel to Budapest and Bucharest, he said.Yet when he was asked when he thought he came into his own as an artist, Mr. Havadtoy laughed with gusto and said: Any day now."}

{"text": "OAKMONT, Pa.  The United States Open does not sneak up on anyone, but every year, many players feel ambushed.The event is billed as the most demanding test in golf, and yet when it predictably leaves the worlds best players struggling, if not gasping, they nonetheless lash out with a grating chorus of complaints about unfair course conditions.But a curious thing could happen when the 116th Open begins Thursday at the venerable Oakmont Country Club. Ballooning scores will surely turn a few stomachs, but the bellyaching might be kept to a minimum.The reason is simple: No one dares to dis Oakmont. It is bad karma and self-defeating.Or as Paul Azinger, the 12-time PGA Tour winner who is now the lead golf analyst for Fox Sports, said, Youre cooked if you grumble your way around here.As one of the most arduous golf courses in North America, Oakmont is approached with a mix of reverence and fright. It has been humbling golfers since before World War I. This will be the ninth time Oakmont has hosted the Open  the most of any site  and it has never failed to show up a vast majority of the field.Most players take their penance and walk away quietly before Oakmont tacks on another double bogey in the parking lot for backing out of a space too carelessly.What is the point of whining about the course after a dreadful round? Is misadventure not to be expected here? Its Oakmont.It would be like complaining that a marathon is tiring.The course is lengthy, its bunkers are intimidating, the greens are terrifyingly quick, and it has odd, inscrutable drainage ditches just off the fairways that resemble mass graves.A rough round at Oakmont is something to celebrate because most rounds are closer to horrifying. So, this year, for once at least, protests about the severity of an Open golf course might seem more comical than caustic.As Mike Davis, the executive director of the United States Golf Association, which conducts the championship, said: Stern, tough conditions are part of Oakmonts DNA and have been since Day 1. I do believe there is some understanding of this by the players.Just so you understand where the U.S.G.A. is coming from institutionally, Davis also said that we kind of joke internally that if we get all compliments from the players, we have probably done something wrong.The golfers know what is coming. They are already tiptoeing lightly around the Oakmont grounds, hoping that they will not accidentally insult their host.Rory McIlroy was asked to assess the prevailing emotion of the players as they approached this weeks competition. As a point of reference, the reporter noted that the players were usually excited heading into the Masters.This week, its not excitement  I mean, its definitely not that, said McIlroy, who then searched for the right word.Trepidation, I guess, he said.Phil Mickelson assessed the layout that awaits the field Thursday as the hardest course in the world or in America or wherever.Theres no reprieve off the tee, theres no reprieve into the greens, and theres certainly no reprieve on the greens, he said.In 2007, when the Open last visited Oakmont, Mickelson was among the players objecting to the conditions. By Wednesday, Mickelson, 45, had apparently undergone a kind of middle-aged reversal therapy. He now wants Oakmont to be harder than ever.I would love to see it cross the line the way U.S. Opens often do and become a little bit over the edge, Mickelson said. That actually benefits me, because were going to have a winner at the end of the week. Whatever that score is  who cares if its five under or 12 over  it doesnt matter, the lowest score wins.So I would like to see it go over that edge, because I feel like Ive learned how to play that style of golf.The first tee shot of the Open has yet to be launched, and some of the best-known players are already back-flipping into places they have never been before. Wait until they hit shots in places theyve never been before.What Oakmont represents is not just a demanding course established in 1904. It is ultimately a standard for elite, rigorous golf.Not inconsequentially, Oakmont over the decades has also identified and crowned some worthy major champions, including Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller and Ernie Els.Its seen as the most prestigious place to win a U.S. Open, Azinger said. Thats its reputation. So the grumbling is not justified. You might as well embrace it.Ultimately, when it comes to major championship traditions, it is important to remember that Oakmont has some of its own. It was W. C. Fownes, son of the Oakmont founder, who responded to the early criticism of the courses unrelenting challenges with a pronouncement that has served as something of a mantra for the place ever since: Let the clumsy, the spineless, the alibi artist stand aside."}
{"text": "PILZONE, Italy  It was a long-held dream, but finally, this week, the conceptual artist Christo walked on water.On Thursday, he tried out his latest project, The Floating Piers, a walkway stretching three kilometers, or nearly two miles, that connects two small islands in Lake Iseo, in Italys Lombardy region, to each other and to the mainland.Christo stepped out on the floating walkway of puckered yellow-orange nylon fabric, designed to change color according to the time of the day and the weather. On Thursday, it was pockmarked with bright orange blotches left by footsteps treading on the rain-drenched fabric.Its actually very painterly, like an abstract painting, but it will change all the time, Christo, 81, a Bulgarian-born American, said of his project.The Floating Piers is his first outdoor installation since 2005, when he and Jeanne-Claude, his collaborator and wife, installed 7,500 saffron-paneled gates in Central Park in New York City. Like his other environmental artworks, which try to reframe familiar landscapes, the 15 million euro project (or $16.8 million), will be funded through the sale of his original drawings and collages.I think this is a record in the history of Christos special projects because he and the team realized it in 22 months; normally it takes decades, the curator Germano Celant, the projects director, said. So I will say that its an Italian and American miracle at the same time.Walking on the floating pier, as I discovered, is akin to being on a lightly rocking boat, without feeling wary about suddenly toppling over should a strong wave arrive. Shoes are optional, and its probably worth taking them off, at least for a moment, to feel the fabrics texture. (There is a layer of felt beneath the saffron cover.) When wet, the walkway is a little squishy; when sunny, it should feel warm to the toes.Look! Christo said, pointing to a juncture where two pathways joined to form a bright saffron-colored V, contrasting against the deep blue of the lake. You see! It falls in that way so you can see the movement, he said. Its actually breathing.Getting the walkway to both gently undulate and remain securely affixed to the uneven lake bottom was a feat that has occupied engineers, construction companies, French deep-sea divers and even a team of Bulgarian athletes drafted over the past two years. The walkway is assembled from 220,000 high-density polyethylene cubes that form its 16-meter-wide (53 feet) spine, covered this week with a waterproof and stain-resistant fabric made by a German company for the project.Each project is like a slice of our lives, Christo said, and part of something that I will never forget.From Saturday through July 3, the project will be open and free to the public 24 hours a day, with a legion of boat hands, lifeguards, monitors and information officers standing guard to avert unintentional dips in the lake.Its really a physical thing, you need to be there, walking it, on the streets, here, Christo said. And its demanding. The route, which laps around the small island of San Paolo, also includes pedestrian areas in the towns of Sulzano, on the mainland, and Peschiera Maraglio, on Monte Isola, an islet rising out of the lake.The project, he said, is all this  the piers, the lake, the mountains, with the sun, the rain, the wind, its part of the physicality of the project, you have to live it.I know these projects are totally irrational, totally useless, he added. The world can live without them, nobody needs them, only me and Jeanne-Claude. She always made the point that they exist because we like to have them, and if others like them, its only a bonus.Christo, whose full name is Christo Javacheff, and his wife, who died in 2009, envisaged a floating piers project 46 years ago, when they were approached by an Argentine art historian who suggested the Ro de la Plata basin in South America as a site, but the plans fell through. Drawings for that version are on display at the Museo di Santa Giulia, in nearby Brescia.In 1995, they considered reviving it in Tokyo Bay, but that project, too, was never realized. Yet Christo was determined. Some projects remain in your heart, he said.Apart from the sporadic protests of labor unions and a national environmental organization that was worried about the impact on the lake, the Italian project went smoothly after local officials and administrators came on board.Christo said it was about positively exploiting the incredible chemistry of humans from all walks of life, each member of the team focusing energy on something that does not exist  to the point where it does. He was also relieved that there was never a discussion with officials about installing a safety fence along the sides of the walkway, allowing visitors to walk to the edge of the water. The moment you have a parapet, forget it, he said, the feeling of walking on water is gone.Other concerns about the ability of a small lake community to deal with the avalanche of visitors that the walkway is expected to draw  an estimated 40,000 people a day  appear to have been muted for now by enthusiasm for the project. Lake Iseo is perhaps northern Italys least famous lake, overshadowed by the neighboring Lake Garda. But hotels and other lodging options here and in nearby towns are nearly booked for the duration of the run.Lake Iseo wont be the same after this event, said Fiorello Turla, the mayor of Monte Isola. Monte Isola will change skin, as its exposure to the global spotlight puts it on the map, he added. Its a great opportunity that weve been given and that we want to seize and bring forward.At the close of its 16-day run, the walkway will be dismantled and its parts recycled and resold. The important part of this project is the temporary part, the nomadic quality, Christo said. The work needs to be gone, because I do not own the work, no one does. This is why it is free."}
{"text": "VISIUM HEDGE FUND MANAGERS CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING Federal authorities filed criminal and civil securities charges against three current and former traders at Visium Asset Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund focused on health care, Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook. Prosecutors said that the fund had an inside view of the drug approval process at the Food and Drug Administration that gave it trading windfalls of $32 million.Gordon Johnston, a former deputy director of the office of generic drugs who became a consultant, is accused of leveraging his F.D.A. contacts and abusing his role at the Generic Drug Trade Association, to glean information on behalf of Sanjay Valvani, one of Visiums top portfolio managers. The authorities said Mr. Johnston arranged speaking panels and teleconferences between F.D.A. officials and generic drug manufacturers to discuss issues that directly concerned his hedge fund client.Mr. Valvani was able to reap nearly $32 million in illicit gains based on information about coming approvals for a generic version of a drug that helps prevent blood clots, according to court filings. Prosecutors also accused Mr. Valvani of passing on the tips to Christopher Plaford, a former colleague.Mr. Plaford has pleaded guilty to trading on illegal tips. Mr. Johnston has also pleaded guilty and they are both cooperating with the government.Mr. Valvanis lawyer, Barry H. Berke, said his client was innocent. The prosecution of Mr. Valvani is yet another example of this United States attorneys office stretching the facts and law to try to transform entirely innocent trading decisions into a crime, he said.The networks used by hedge funds to get an investing edge were the focus of a crackdown by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, that resulted in the convictions of more than 80 traders, consultants and analysts.Although Mr. Bhararas office was dealt a blow when a federal appellate court overturned two prominent convictions from 2014, it has gained momentum again in the last month.\n\nTENCENT NEARS DEAL TO BUY MAKER OF CLASH OF CLANS Tencent is near a deal to buy Supercell, the Finnish game company that makes Clash of Clans, Michael J. de la Merced and Nick Wingfield report in DealBook. A person briefed on the matter said the transaction would value the company at more than $9 billion.Tencent, with a market value of about $211 billion, controls the messaging service WeChat as well as a number of online games hosted on its QQ portal. A deal for Supercell would be the biggest takeover by any of Chinas so-called BAT trio of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, according to data from Standard & Poors Global Market Intelligence.Supercell has produced a string of hits like Clash of Clans, Hay Day and Clash Royale. It reported revenue of $2.33 billion for 2015, up from $1.78 billion the previous year. Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization also rose to $964 million, from $592 million. Tencent is already Chinas dominant online game company, accounting for about 32 percent of revenue from Chinas online game market in 2015, according to the research firm Niko Partners.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Tencent would buy the roughly 73 percent stake in Supercell that is held by SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications provider, said a person briefed on the discussions. Supercells founders would remain at the company.The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the discussions, said that Tencent was also in discussions with financial investors, like Hillhouse Capital Group of Beijing, to join the deal as co-investors.ON THE AGENDA Oracle will hold a call on its latest earnings at 5 p.m.INVESTORS BYPASS PRIVATE EQUITY Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and even private families have been flexing their deal-making muscles and taking stakes in companies themselves, Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.These so-called emerging buyers are looking for investment gains without paying management fees to private equity firms. Over the last year and a half, they bought about 17 percent of the assets sold by private equity firms, up from 2 percent in 2007, according to Goldman Sachs data. They were even more active as buyers than private equity firms themselves.They are investing in every sector around the world. Saudi Arabias main investment fund took a $3.5 billion stake in Uber this month. JAB Holding Company, the investment arm of the Reimann family in Germany, led the acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain for about $14 billion in March.The risks, however, are higher for these newcomers because they do not have the same people to find and vet deals that a private equity firm or a bank would have. But banks are stepping in  Goldman Sachs plans to expand its financial sponsors group to focus more on emerging buyers.Emerging buyers are also taking steps to make their internal deal-making departments more professional. Three years ago, Abu Dhabis sovereign fund created its own group, which now has 15 people, to focus on direct investments.Emerging buyers are also making deals in conjunction with private equity firms, a practice known as co-investing. This gives private equity firms access to a larger pool of capital to make bigger acquisitions, while it allows investors, whom they call limited partners, to pay few or no fees. Of 140 limited partners surveyed last year by PricewaterhouseCoopers, 73 percent said they had co-invested in at least one deal.Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.comMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS A FanDuel-DraftKings Merger Might Be Worth a Chance There would be some obvious savings from turning two daily fantasy sports sites into one big one, Jennifer Saba writes in Breakingviews.\nNYT FireEye Said to Have Rebuffed Takeover Offers FireEye, the online security company, turned down at least two suitors, Bloomberg reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

{"text": "The Waiting Man I, by the American photographer Kia Chenelle, represents the epitome of male sartorial elegance. The man (Slide 9) wears a double-breasted blazer, tweed trousers and sleek sandals. A mass of dreadlocks issues from under his dapper hat. Sunglasses and a pocket square complete his look.While the image could easily pass for a high fashion photograph, it is more of a portrait and, beyond that, a meditation on black male self-possession and power. It appears in an illuminating traveling exhibition, now at the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco, Dandy Lion: (Re)Articulating Black Masculine Identity. Featuring the work of more than 20 photographers  and a film series  the project is the first to comprehensively explore contemporary dandyism in black communities throughout the world, examining how men of African descent defy stereotypes and monolithic understandings of masculinity through clothing and style.Organized by Shantrelle P. Lewis for the Museum of Contemporary Photography at Columbia College Chicago, the exhibition reflects a burgeoning movement among men of African descent encompassing a manner of dress, attitude, and biting sense of humor with both historical antecedents and contemporary motivations. Ms. Lewis noted that black dandyism integrates European menswear with a distinctly African aesthetic  a sensibility that can be traced back to 15th-century African rulers who blended the two styles as well as to the dressing up of enslaved Africans in Europe and America during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.If sartorial flair combated pervasive stereotypes of brutishness or subservience, it lives on today not just to express individuality and stylishness, but often to contest mainstream media portrayals of black men as menacing thugs. These trickster Dandy Lions are high-styled rebels, wrote Ms. Lewis in the exhibitions introductory text.But as Dandy Lion makes clear, it is not just the dandies themselves, but photographs of them that function as rebellious surrogates, fighting stereotypes with striking counter images. Dandy Lion presents a global perspective, its photographers working in diverse locations in the United States, South Africa, Congo and Europe. Their work represents mens fashion at its boldest and most dynamic: audacious leopard prints, Dutch wax cloth suits paired with plaid ties and pocket squares, stylish straw hats and fedoras, spats, and ever-present sunglasses. These men are not afraid of color nor of mixing and matching styles, much in the same vein as the era of hip-hop that birthed them, Ms. Lewis wrote.Historically, within black and white cultures across the world, the dandy has served as a transgressive figure. In 19th-century Europe, the French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire, drawing on the writer Jules Barbey dAurevillys study of the quintessential fashionable dandy, Beau Brummel, helped popularize the dandy as the epitome of urban countercultural resistance and of the brashness of modernity. To Baudelaire, the dandy was a sartorial revolutionary. He employed clothing and style in the passionate pursuit of an original selfhood that makes its own rules, the art historian Susan Fillin-Yeh wrote. Or as Baudelaire himself put it, Dandyism [is] an institution beyond the laws.The idea of dandyism as a form of personal expression and social and cultural resistance among people of color has a long history in the United States. The writer Stuart Cosgrove has examined this connection in relationship to the zoot-suiters of the mid-20th century  African-American and Latino dandies, whose richly tailored and padded clothing conveyed a distinctly political message.The zoot suit was a refusal  of subservience, Mr. Cosgrove wrote. It was during his period as a young zoot-suiter that the Chicano union activist Cesar Chavez first came into contact with community politics, and it was through the experiences of participating in zoot-suit riots in Harlem, that the young Detroit Red began a political education that transformed him into the Black radical leader Malcolm X.As early as the 19th century, the appearance of the black dandy was often cause for alarm in white America  a threatening presence, as the art historian Richard J. Powell observed, in the context of a society where black people (and specifically black men) had clearly demarcated positions and identities and posed a challenge to the American body politic when they failed to conform to white expectations.While scholars have traced the roots of the black dandy to the West  specifically, Britain  Ms. Lewis noted that he originated in Africa. Throughout the continent, highly refined sartorial aesthetics and tailoring were the hallmark of African mens fashion for centuries. Dandyism has remained an important part of African society, advanced by such movements as la Socit des Ambianceurs et des Personnes lgantes (the Society of Ambience Makers and People of Elegance), which originated in the French speaking Congo, as well as the Swenkas, the debonair working-class Zulu men of South Africa.In the end, Dandy Lion reminds us of the extent to which the dandy has historically challenged  and continues to challenge  a limited or proscribed view of men of color.Whether hanging out at a gentlemens club or attending the African Street Festival in London, there is an unspoken conversation being had between Black men globally about how they want to be seen in the world, reads an exhibition text. The decision to defy social expectations of how they show up in the world is an exuberant act of agency and defiance in the face of a world that isnt always friendly to Black men and boys.Maurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "Sizing up the honesty of small-business owners is one of the Internal Revenue Services most vexing problems.The agency estimates that it collects $458 billion a year less in taxes from all Americans than the government is actually due. Most of that tax gap is income that goes unreported, and the biggest chunk of it, by far  $125 billion  is individual business income.Taxpayers in this category, primarily sole proprietors, pay taxes on the money their operations make through their personal returns. Thus, their cash flows can be particularly opaque.Take owners like Rebeca Mojica, a chainmaille jewelry designer in West Hollywood, Calif., who was audited in 2011. Her sales fluctuate significantly from year to year, and she takes some payments in cash. Were she so inclined, she could easily hide a chunk of that income.The dreaded audit is the main way the I.R.S. catches scofflaws and ferrets out unreported income, but it is a time-consuming and imperfect tool. Short on resources, the agency collected just $7.3 billion from audits last year, its lowest total in 13 years.What the I.R.S. really wants is for business owners to voluntarily pay more of what they owe. But 63 percent of low visibility income, the kind that isnt captured by outside parties on tax information documents, is not disclosed on tax forms, the agency says.So for the last four years, the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the I.R.S., has been running studies to help it figure out how more small-business owners who pay their taxes can be persuaded to report their earnings more accurately.One finding suggests that audits, the agencys most powerful compliance tool, seem to have little lasting deterrent effect on tax cheats, and could even backfire for honest taxpayers.That discovery, and others, could help inform the agencys future collection techniques.For one, those suspected of tax dodging tend to cluster in certain geographic areas. The agency mapped out 365 communities with notably low tax-compliance rates among sole proprietors. Many were based in the South and West. California alone makes up a full third of the list; Georgia and Texas were also heavily represented.(The researchers tried to compile a similar data-set of high-compliance places where business owners are likely to report their earnings accurately, but it found only three. Those in Mott Haven, a neighborhood in the South Bronx; West Somerville, Mass.; and Portersville, Ind., appear to be unusually law-abiding.)What is behind the clusters? Community norms play a major role, the tax researchers theorized. Business owners who were less compliant in paying their taxes were more likely to be active in civic groups and religious congregations, and they appear to exhibit a stronger association with local institutions than national ones such as the federal government.In other words, if people at your neighborhood potlucks or trade group meetings take a dim view of Washington, you might be more inclined to do some fudging at tax time.Another surprise was the effectiveness of audits.Self-employed individuals who went through an audit and were found to be clean  reported less income in subsequent years, a different study found. The drop wasnt small: Three years after their audits, the studys test group of taxpayers reported 35 percent less in taxable income than a control group of similar taxpayers who had not been audited.The researchers could only guess at a cause. The audit may have been a discouraging experience and sapped the subjects tax morale. Or perhaps it inadvertently offered insight into previously unknown tactics for both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion.Most audits are not random. The I.R.S. has a secret algorithm that it uses to calculate how likely each taxpayer is to have unreported income. Those with high scores are more likely to be audited  and once the auditors start digging, they usually find things. Of the 1.2 million individual returns that the agency audited (including sole proprietorships) in 2014, only 13 percent emerged without any tax adjustments.For those who dodge their taxes and get caught, the sting seems to fade fast. In the years right after an audit, taxpayers who had to make additional payments appeared to become a bit more compliant, but the effect diminished over time and disappeared entirely by Year 5,  another study found.Any initial impact of the audit on compliance is short-lived, the researchers concluded.That doesnt surprise Fred Daily, a Florida tax lawyer who specializes in audits and tax crimes.Ive had people who got caught by the I.R.S. and got serious damage  hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage  and at first, theyre like people just out of jail: Im never going back again! A few years later, theyre right back to doing what they had done before, he said. Peoples character doesnt change.Still, Mr. Daily says that only a minority of those he encounters actively intend to cheat. Many people, especially business owners, run into problems in an audit simply because they kept bad records or did not understand all of their tax obligations.Its so easy to call yourself a sole proprietor; just put up a website or print a business card, he said. They dont realize all the requirements, like quarterly estimated reporting and the self-employment tax. The tax laws are impenetrable.But even for law-abiding owners, an audit is unnerving and time-consuming. Ms. Mojica, the jewelry designer, estimates that she spent $500 in accounting fees and 15 hours of her and her staffs time dealing with her 2011 audit. The process lasted seven months.In the end, she owed nothing  which provided an unanticipated psychological boost.I had this feeling of, Yay! Im doing all right! Ms. Mojica said. I also felt motivated to keep even better records. I spent an hour or two trying to find information on a very small number of transactions, and I could have been spared that if wed kept a better paper trail.The good news for business owners is that audits are extremely rare. Around 1.5 percent of self-employed taxpayers are audited each year, the agency says.In any case, businesses should always brace for the possibility of an audit. Document everything is the advice Vanessa Kruze, an accountant who focuses on start-ups, gives her clients. Expense reports draw particular scrutiny from auditors, and using a program like Expensify to track receipts makes it much simpler to back up claims, she said.Mr. Daily, who has been steering clients through audits for 35 years, said the biggest surprise to him is how rarely the I.R.S. checks back on the worst offenders.The agencys budget cuts have taken a noticeable toll, he said.Its really counterintuitive how they do not stay on some of these people and audit them year after year, Mr. Daily said. Ive had people where, as we finish an audit, Ive said, This very likely isnt the last time you will see the I.R.S.  and actually, it is."}
{"text": "KARACHI, Pakistan  I live in a neighborhood by the shore made famous by the eighth-century saint Abdullah Shah Ghazi. He has been the citys designated trouble-shooter since he arrived here as a horse trader. If you have an urgent problem that the living cant help with, you walk up the stairs of the shrine. You offer a prayer and maybe a handful of rose petals. Your problem may not be solved immediately, but you come out feeling better.So confident are Karachiites of Ghazis power that whenever there is a storm warning, instead of running away, they rush to the sea to have some fun. This city has had its share of troubles  water shortages, ethnic strife, gang wars, criminalized local politics  but for more than 12 centuries Ghazi has protected it from the fury of the Arabian Sea.Now Karachis savior saint is himself in trouble. Ghazi has a new upstart neighbor: the Bahria Icon Towers, a pair of buildings including one 62 stories high that will be Pakistans highest building and the countrys first proper skyscraper. The project, though unfinished, doesnt just dwarf the saints shrine; it has surrounded it with ugly prison-like walls, making the shrine invisible and very, very difficult to access.Like any wise saint living by the sea, Ghazi, according to folklore, chose to set his shrine at the top of a hillock. Its green and white striped dome used to be visible from miles away. Its open courtyards and surrounding empty spaces have hosted thousands of people every day, and hundreds of thousands on public holidays and on the anniversary of Ghazis death. People come for prayer, music, food and rendezvous. The shrine hosts a nonstop party for the kind of people who dont get invited to parties.Ghazis new neighbor will have corporate offices, luxury apartments and shopping malls with international brands. Its ads promise a life full of aromatherapy, desserts decorated with spun sugar and happy, healthy babies bobbing in infinity pools. Bahria Icon Towers is expecting lots of cars, for corporate workers and the residents of luxury apartments. The developers have built a multistory car park and a flyover with a network of underpasses. A gift to the people, they never forget to tell us.The affluent residents of the area resisted initially, but gave up after the developers dug up entire roads around the shrine and went to court to get an injunction so they could keep going. The courts also relented because, frankly, who can resist the lure of a skyscraper?Now that the flyover and underpasses are complete, the area has become so labyrinthine that if Ghazi himself passed by he would need all his saintly powers to navigate the entrance to his own shrine. That is, if he recognized it all. After citizens warned that the skyscraper might damage the structure of the shrine, the developers decided to build huge sand-colored concrete walls around it. A gift to the people.The green and white dome and the blue and white striped exterior of the shrine that were the emblem of the city have disappeared from its skyline. Ghazi, who once lorded over Karachi, has been practically imprisoned in an ugly giant riad-like villa.Pakistan is dotted with shrines of saints with great reputations. Theres the one who cures diabetes. The one who will give you a son. The one who can get your son off death row. And all the ones who wrote great poetry and made brilliant music that have survived centuries.But love for Abdullah Shah Ghazi is so widespread that even people who dont believe in mosques, prayer or spiritual healing walk up to his shrine with secret wishes and plastic bags full of petals. A suicide attack in 2010, which left at least seven people dead, didn't scare visitors away.Ghazis shrine is a last-chance saloon for those who cant go to the government and cant afford a therapist. For those who cant talk to their sister or whose sister wont talk to them; for those with sick babies or who are desperate for babies; for newly married couples or for people who want their spouses back. Its the only public place in Karachi where people can break down and cry and everyone around them will understand.Many of the regulars here are sweaty, smelly people, and they will never be allowed inside the Bahria Icon Towers. Who will protect them now that property developers are threatening Ghazi? And who will protect all of us from the elements?There was a time when the Arabian Sea lapped at the shrines feet. Over the decades the sea has been pushed back, and all around the shrine miles and miles of land have been reclaimed so that posh mansions and shopping areas could be built.This is the development model Karachi has followed. There are signal-free corridors for car owners, but hardly any footpaths for the millions who walk to work. There are air-conditioned shopping malls for affluent consumers, but the police hound street vendors claiming theyre a threat to public order.McDonalds occupies the prime spot on the beach, and thats become the smelliest part. Developers cared more about the parking lot than the sewage system, and waste is being dumped in the Arabian Sea.But then who needs the sea, or a saint to protect us against it, when we can have infinity pools in the sky?"}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Obama Condemns Trumps Response to Florida Attack (front page, June 15): President Obamas remarks condemning Donald Trumps hateful rhetoric and dangerous mind-set were a welcome relief and a badly needed reality check to the frenzy that has followed the horrible events in Orlando. As I watched him lay out his case I thought: This is real leadership. How grateful I am that he is our president.His clarity, compassion, empathy and righteous anger all rang true. May his example reassure those who are uncertain in these troubled times that even in the worst of times there are always hopeful ways forward.MAREA SIRIS WEXLERNorthampton, Mass.To the Editor:President Obama is correct that Donald Trumps rhetoric is dangerous, but Mr. Trump is right about one thing. After every terrorism act with Islamic roots, Mr. Obamas immediate reaction is to spend more time chastising Republicans and conservatives about what he sees as their demonization of and discrimination against all Muslims than he does denouncing the terrorists themselves.Even as Mr. Obama takes great pains not to define Islam with sweeping labels, he stereotypes the American political right as filled with actual and potential discriminators. In historical terms, Mr. Obama implies that Republicans are always just one incident away from rounding up Muslims the way Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, once rounded up Japanese-Americans, while Mr. Obama himself and his fellow Democrats of today are of course far more enlightened than that.It is true, as Mr. Obama says, that some terrorists have used Mr. Trumps words as a recruitment tool, as does the Democratic Party for that matter. One wonders if continually linking Mr. Trumps talk to terrorist recruitment only goads the terrorists into exploiting it further.MARK R. GODBURNNorth Canaan, Conn.To the Editor:Re Old Political Tactic Is Revived: Exploiting Fear, Not Easing It (front page, June 15):Donald Trump fulminates repeatedly against President Obamas and Hillary Clintons reluctance to use the terms radical Islam or extremist radical Islam in the national conversation on terrorism. We know that for many decades the Ku Klux Klan burned homes and churches and brutalized and murdered black Americans. They often did this under the sign of burning crosses and in the name of Christianity.I wonder if Mr. Trump and his supporters feel it would be accurate, politically appropriate and socially helpful to designate the Klan as radical Christians and their hateful ideology as extremist Christianity.ANDREW LEAFRockville Centre, N.Y.To the Editor:My wife and I, visiting Paris, were watching a CNN panel covering the Orlando tragedy. The final panelist observed that if there were to be a second terrorist attack, it would have a profound effect on the presidential election. Really?Here in Paris there have been two attacks carried out in the last year and a half by highly coordinated, multiple gunmen directly ordered by Islamic terrorist groups. While the French are highly critical of their overwhelmingly unpopular president, Franois Hollande, blaming him for almost everything else, no one blames him for these attacks.Will the actions of a single, likely disturbed, self-radicalized lone wolf actually determine whom we will elect to be our next president?MAURICE NELSON Jr.ParisTo the Editor:How Trump Stands to Gain by Focusing on Gun Control (The Upshot, nytimes.com, June 15) should be a warning to Hillary Clinton about treading carefully, as theres a land mine in her path. One possible direction for her would be to talk about gun control only in the related contexts of national security and terrorism.Mrs. Clinton needs to reassure law-abiding gun owners that shes on their side when it comes to being strong on national security and protecting Americans against the bad guys. She needs to lay her own land mines along Mr. Trumps path, letting him walk into the terrorism trap and show that he will make things far worse.MARK BLOCKMaplewood, N.J."}
{"text": "The 229th time I scraped the bottom of our Volkswagen over a tope  Mexicos brand of speed bump  I swore as though Id just been rear-ended by a truck.There was no sign to warn of the giant mound of pavement, which meant that I hit the thing at full-on launch velocity. And its size practically guaranteed damage: In my rearview mirror, I could see deep lines scraped by my cars chassis and many others before me.Must have just been poorly fashioned, you say? A mistake? If only.There are thousands, maybe millions, of these misshapen risers on back roads and highways all over Mexico. The biggest of the bunch look like Fernando Botero sculptures before he slimmed them down.When I arrived in Mexico as a New York Times correspondent, I thought the topes were just infrequent oddities. But over time, layers of meaning emerged, as they do with so many things in Mexico.Topes (pronounced TOE-pace) are suspension-killing wonders that fill a void in law and order. In a country where impunity rules, topes are screams of frustration. Theyre a means of enforcing speed control and civility on the road, and they cant be avoided. They cant be bribed to look the other way.But topes also reflect the same failures that they aim to fix. There appear to be few rules governing what they look like or where they go. Ive seen makeshift topes materialize in upper-class neighborhoods from one day to the next, and Ive seen topes that were built, Im convinced, just to make drivers slow down for vendors who sell candy and water.Other topes seem to have been created more with vengeance in mind, which now makes me wonder: Was someone after a corrupt gang member or businessman who sped by every morning? Or was the target really me  a foreigner from that country up north that never seems to give Mexico the respect it deserves?"}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Apple customers have a lot to digest this summer.The iPhone maker kicked off its annual conference for software developers on Monday with major upgrades for the operating systems powering its computers, mobile devices, smartwatch and TV box.Technology enthusiasts and gear heads are usually excited about big upgrades, but for average consumers, the changes can be overwhelming. Will devices get better or worse? Will the software change so much that it will disrupt the tools we use for work?Thankfully, Apples four upgraded operating systems  iOS, tvOS, MacOS and WatchOS  are due out in the fall, so there is plenty of time to research and prepare.At Apple, we believe that technology should lift humanity and should enrich peoples lives in all the ways they want to experience it  whether its on their wrist, in the living room, on the desk, in the palm of their hand, Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, said during Mondays keynote presentation.Here is a guide to how your devices will change if you install the software upgrades in a few months.Apples next version of its mobile operating system, called iOS 10, will have an impact on how you communicate and potentially reduce the amount of time you spend fiddling with the phone.Among them, the Messages app that iPhone and iPad users primarily rely on for sending text messages will get a major overhaul. In the app, you will soon be able to draw sketches and hand-write notes to others, as well as attach animations, like confetti or fireworks. Apple is also letting third-party software developers offer modifications to the Messages app, meaning you might be able to add special messages, like stickers, special emoji or animated GIFs.Apple is also making major changes to its photo app included on iPhones and iPads. Similar to Google Photos, Apples Photos app will automatically scan your photo album and organize the photos based on when and where the photos were taken. In some cases, it may automatically combine images from an occasion, like a trip to Japan, into video montages called Memories.Another significant change is the evolution of Siri, Apples voice assistant. Third-party app developers can take advantage of voice commands, so you should be able to use voice commands to summon an Uber car, send a message through WhatsApp or map a jog with a fitness app, among other tricks.Other changes will not require a significant reset. With iOS 10, the iPhone screen will wake up when you raise it up  no need to press a button anymore. Apple also redesigned its music app with new colors and navigation features. Its default maps app will let outside developers integrate their services into the mapping app, so you might be able to book a restaurant table by tapping on a restaurant inside the map, for example. Apple is also adding the ability to search for nearby points of interest, like gas stations and coffee shops, similar to Googles Waze app.Apples Macs will soon work more seamlessly with other Apple devices. Among other changes, the Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, will gain access to Siri. So most of what you can do with Siri on your iPhone should also be doable on Mac computers.Sierra will also have tighter integration with other Apple devices. If you are wearing an Apple Watch, you can log into a Mac computer without typing in a password. When shopping on the web, you can use an iPhone to pay with Apple Pay, the companys mobile wallet service, by taking out the iPhone and registering your fingerprint to complete the purchase.Any owner of an Apple Watch is familiar with this situation: Try to open a third-party app like Instagram or Twitter on the watch, and it takes at least five seconds to load. At that point, you might as well just take out your iPhone and open the app there instead.Apple is now trying to address this problem with WatchOS, the next version of the operating system for Apple Watch. The company says third-party apps will open instantly with the new update.Another important change is coming to the fitness portion of Apple Watch. With the update, you will be able to see the fitness activity of other friends wearing Apple Watch, like the number of hours they have stood up and calories they have burned. Apple also added some new watch faces, letting you tailor the look to your liking.The next version of tvOS, the Apple TVs software system, caters largely to sports fans. A new feature called Live Tune In will let you immediately access a live broadcast. Speaking a command like Watch ESPN2 can load a live sports game.Other than that, Apple made several improvements to areas that were the most frustrating about Apple TV. For one, it will support a feature called Single Sign-On. If you have multiple apps that offer programming from the same pay-TV provider, you can log in just once and all of those apps will be authenticated. That will spare you the headache of entering the same user name and password repeatedly for each of those apps.Apple also expanded its Apple TV remote-control app that it offers for iPhones. Basically, the remote app will gain the same capabilities as the physical remote for the Apple TV, which includes a button for accessing Siri. So in the event that your remote control vanishes between your couch cushions, you can launch the remote app on your iPhone and use Siri to find something to watch, or swipe around on the phone screen to select an app.When the upgrades are released this fall, consumers would benefit from a somewhat cautious approach. Often with big software upgrades, bugs creep into earlier versions, so its wise to wait at least a few weeks to assess whether the coast is clear before jumping in."}
{"text": "The Metropolitan Opera has been transmitting performances live for a decade. The National Theater in London jumped on board a few years later. But Broadway, facing both financial and philosophical obstacles, has been slow to join the trend.Now, after years of start-and-stop progress, Broadway is passing a milestone: On Wednesday, the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company, which with three Broadway theaters is one of the industrys most prolific producers, said it had agreed to allow a live stream of a much-praised musical revival, She Loves Me, which is running through July 10 at Studio 54.The event will be streamed by BroadwayHD, a new company seeking to broadcast theater performances, on June 30. It will be the first time a Broadway show has been streamed live, the company said. Unlike the broadcasts by the Met, the National Theater and several European opera and ballet companies, it will be available not in movie theaters but on the internet, Roku and Apple TV.I think it will create more interest in Broadway, said Todd Haimes, the longtime artistic director of the Roundabout. There used to be this feeling, if a movie was made of a Broadway show, that would kill the Broadway show. Then something happened. It was called Chicago. They made the movie, and the Chicago sales went through the roof.The theater industry has been inching in this direction for years. There have been broadcasts on PBS (a Roundabout production of The Man Who Came to Dinner was shown in 2000) and on commercial television (Legally Blonde was once on MTV). Post-closing broadcasts were screened in movie theaters (Of Mice and Men was shown in cinemas by NT Live, the National Theaters program), and, recently, Off Broadway shows (Buried Child, at the New Group, and Old Hats, at Signature Theater) have been live streamed by BroadwayHD.But the complications are daunting. Theater is a highly unionized industry, and figuring out how to compensate performers and creators has been hard. Despite widespread evidence that broadcasts increase ticket sales, many producers remain concerned about discouraging potential ticket buyers. And it is not clear whether any individual broadcast can be profitable. (The Met Opera, the National Theater and the Roundabout are all nonprofits.)The most difficult part of this is the cost  everyone has to get compensation  and the challenge is determining the value of the live stream, said Ken Davenport, a producer who last year streamed a performance of an Off Broadway musical, Daddy Long Legs. He said the broadcast was watched by about 150,000 people, and built buzz for the show, but was not profitable.Mr. Davenport said that as technology has improved, the value of broadcasting theater has increased. It will never replace live performance, he said. The theater has survived the radio, the television, the internet and every other form of entertainment out there. But for people that cant experience it live, its a great first taste.Nonprofit institutions with subscribers have an incentive to support the broadcasts both as part of their mission  to reach wider audiences  and because they are building long-lasting brands. For commercial producers, the calculus is different.Its definitely much harder there, because there is an expectation that it has to be a success immediately, said Emma Keith, the head of NT Live in London. Here, everybody was happy to say, Lets take a risk, and it might take time to generate profits, whereas on Broadway it has to make money from Day 1.Nonetheless, interest appears to be growing. We see it as a great opportunity to have an additional revenue stream to the actors, and it also helps to raise the profile of American theater, said Lawrence Lorczak, a senior business representative at Actors Equity.The actors in She Loves Me, who include Laura Benanti, Gavin Creel, Jane Krakowski and Zachary Levi, will be paid extra, under contracts by both Equity and SAG-Aftra, for the broadcast of their work. BroadwayHD also had to reach agreements to compensate the authors of the musical (or their heirs, since some of them are no longer alive).Ms. Benanti said she welcomed the decision to broadcast the production. The theater is such a vitally important part of our culture, she said in an email. The more people able to experience it, the better off we will all be.She Loves Me, which was first presented on Broadway in 1963, is a much-loved musical with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, who are best known for Fiddler on the Roof. Adapted from a Hungarian play that also inspired the film Youve Got Mail, She Loves Me is about lovelorn parfumerie workers in Budapest who feud and flirt (and sing and dance).The She Loves Me broadcast is being financed by BroadwayHD. Roundabout said it is spending nothing on the venture  in fact, it will receive a small amount of compensation.The founders of BroadwayHD, Stewart F. Lane and Bonnie Comley, said that the broadcast would be costly but that they were optimistic it would be profitable. The stream will cost $9.99 to watch on the website, or is free to BroadwayHD subscribers. At some point, it will be available through BroadwayHDs on-demand library.Mr. Lane and Ms. Comley said they chose She Loves Me because of the quality of the production, because its cast members are well known, and because they had been looking to work with Roundabout, hoping to forge a continuing relationship with a producing entity that presents multiple theatrical works.Making the broadcast will require nine or 10 cameras in the theater for three performances (two are to test camera angles, lighting, and sound). Some seats will be left vacant for the cameras (killed, in industry parlance), and audience members who are unhappy with the camera presence will be allowed to exchange their tickets, although many people welcome the opportunity to be at a performance that is broadcast."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Women in China are sending naked photographs of themselves holding their ID cards to peer-to-peer lenders as collateral, Chinese state media have reported, in a trend that may involve thousands of people.The phenomenon, which the Beijing Youth Daily said was taking place on a popular online peer-to-peer lender called Jiedaibao, is provoking alarm and sympathy on social media. It has also led to calls for women to protect themselves from predators who are reportedly blackmailing them with the nude photographs, sometimes demanding sexual services when the women cannot repay at interest rates that can be as high as 30 percent a week.A call seeking comment to Jiedaibao, a leading company in Chinas flourishing peer-to-peer lending market, was not answered late on Wednesday in Beijing.Beijing Youth Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Youth League, said the practice was an open secret.An investigation by Beijing Youth Daily shows that in some money lending groups, female university students naked holding has already become an open secret, it wrote, referring to the practice of women photographing themselves naked holding their ID card as a guarantee of repayment.A man with the online handle of Beijing Ninth Uncle on Weibo, Chinas Twitter-like social media platform, said he was gathering evidence that women from many different walks of life, including farmers and university students, were falling afoul of the lenders demands. The man said he was a writer on the finance industry.With naked holding they can get two to five times the amount of money, but when they cant repay some have been threatened with publishing the photographs, and some lenders are even demanding the female students provide sexual services, Beijing Youth Daily wrote.It described the case of a university student from Jiangsu Province in central China, whom it gave the pseudonym of Lin Xiao. Her troubles began, it said, when she borrowed 500 renminbi, about $75, from a lender in February to open an online store. At 30 percent interest on the one-week loan, she quickly needed more money to repay the debt, eventually borrowing about 120,000 renminbi from 15 people, a sum that soon ballooned into 250,000 renminbi (about $38,000) at the high interest rate.Eventually, the woman supplied a nude photograph of herself in exchange for a larger loan to try to escape her debt, including personal information such as contact numbers and addresses for family members. When she could not repay, the lender threatened to show the photographs to her family and friends, the newspaper reported.As the circle of debt widened, so did the distribution of the naked photographs, until they were in the hands of three online lenders, Beijing Youth Daily reported. At that point she told her family and, with their help, began to clear the debt. But I still owe about 60,000 renminbi, she said.The story could not be independently verified.High interest, naked holding and so on are the private actions of users; this company cannot interfere, Beijing Youth Daily quoted Jiedaibao as saying in response to the reports of such behavior among users. Risks are the borrowers responsibility, it said.On Wednesday, Beijing Ninth Uncle posted a Weibo message calling on the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Some victims had disappeared, he said, meaning their cellphones were off or were ringing unanswered.I call on the police to set up a special group, give the victims confidence, investigate thoroughly, dredge out the criminals, he wrote. Beijing Ninth Uncle declined to be interviewed, saying he did not accept interviews with foreign media."}
{"text": "Noah Syndergaard fell short of a shutout but still pitched strongly enough to strike out 11, and the Mets amassed a season-high 19 hits for a thorough 11-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday at Citi Field.Syndergaard registered one out in the ninth inning before allowing a double by David Freese that scored John Jaso, who had three of the Pirates five hits off Syndergaard.He deserved to go out there in the ninth inning and see if he could get the shutout, Manager Terry Collins said.After throwing 115 pitches, Syndergaard was pulled for Jeurys Familia, who recorded the final two outs as the Mets ended a three-game losing streak.Syndergaards eight and one-third innings were a career high, and he has allowed two or fewer earned runs in each of his last eight starts.The Mets offensive frenzy came after another unexpected lineup shuffle by Collins. The original plan was to have Juan Lagares lead off on Wednesday, but in keeping with recent trends for the Mets, an injury necessitated a change.An hour before the game, Lagares was scratched, unable to play because of lingering pain from the torn ligament in his left thumb. After hitting in the batting cage, Lagares rested for about 20 minutes and then began to feel soreness and stiffness in his left hand. Lagares put on his glove, could not squeeze it and notified Collins.I want to get it checked tomorrow to make sure, but I dont know whats going to happen, said Lagares, who did not feel much pain after the game and was able to close his fingers while he talked to reporters.While Lagaress prognosis is uncertain, the Mets received positive news on the status of Neil Walker. Collins had hoped to have Walker back at second base for Wednesdays game, but Walker texted the teams trainers in the morning to notify them that because of persistent back pain, he did not feel able to play.Walker saw a doctor Wednesday afternoon, received medication and told Collins Wednesday night that he wanted to play Thursday.Without Lagares and Walker, Matt Reynolds played second base, Curtis Granderson moved to the top spot in the order, and Kelly Johnson started in left field, bumping Yoenis Cespedes to center field. The last-minute switch provided a spark: Granderson led off the bottom of the first with a single and scored the games first run, and in the third inning Johnson hit his first home run with the Mets this season.Johnson finished 3 for 5 with two runs scored and two R.B.I. Wilmer Flores drove in four runs, and Cespedes scored three times. Each starting position player for the Mets scored or drove in a run, including Reynolds, who notched three hits and two R.B.I."}

{"text": "The Dreaming Room(Columbia)The English singer Laura Mvulas exceptional second album seems a feat of self-actualization, full of lyrics about managing psycho-spiritual highs and lows, often both at once: I feel lost and found/at the same damn time, she sings in Kiss My Feet.That is the sort of thing that has become nearly necessary for entry into the pop-music sphere. (She has recently given interviews about turmoil in her life that is not identified per se in the songs: panic attacks and a marriage breakup.) But the album is also a broad feat of traditional and technical musicality, which isnt so necessary for that sphere, and which sets her slightly apart from pop. She plans out her own space and commands it.The Dreaming Room represents meticulous formal achievement, a nearly symmetrical series of mountains that Ms. Mvula builds, through her choral and orchestral and rhythmic arrangements, and then climbs. Many of her songs seem ready-made for some kind of theatrical adaptation. Theyre authentically dramatic, built on the swells of brass and strings and percussion, which might suddenly disappear behind some new peak of melody or meaning sung by Ms. Mvula  surrounded in harmony by her own voice, multi-tracked to the vanishing point and enlarged with cathedral echo.The record draws a little closer to pops electronic vernacular, and also to a sense of looseness or play, than her first album, Sing to the Moon. Shes using her voice more flexibly, employing her own intuitive inflections and ornamentations. Shes making her songs land a little harder  such as Overcome, a short work of choral-orchestral funk that packs a houseful of ideas into just over three minutes, including the propulsive and gorgeous rhythm-guitar patterns of Nile Rodgers.At the records center is Show Me Love, its most spacious track, six minutes long. In it, after a piano-and-vocals ballad section, a key change and a hymn-like sequence, the strings play a cycle of chords, quietly at first. For the next three minutes Ms. Mvula seems to improvise over it, with bits of the tightly written lyrics she has already sung. Showed me  showed me love  of the deepest kind, she sings. A little later: No no. Nobody. Theres nobody like you. Now I see you. Now I see you, now I see you. And here she chuckles: a key moment of abandon on a careful record."}
{"text": "HONG KONG  A Chinese court has sentenced the wife and son of the countrys former security chief to prison, a year after the family patriarch was sentenced to life in prison for corruption and leaking state secrets.The Yichang City Peoples Intermediate Court, about 800 miles south of Beijing, handed down a nine-year term to Jia Xiaoye, whose husband, Zhou Yongkang, was until 2012 one of Chinas most powerful officials. His son by a previous marriage, Zhou Bin, received an 18-year prison sentence from the same court on Wednesday, Chinas Central Television reported.The courts official social media site announced Ms. Jias sentence on June 8, but it was reported by Chinas state news media only on Wednesday.Zhou Yongkang, 73, was the highest-ranking official felled so far in President Xi Jinpings crackdown on corruption, now in its fourth year. Until November 2012, Mr. Zhou was a member of the Communist Partys elite Politburo Standing Committee, overseeing the countrys criminal justice system and its huge police force. The sentencing of Mr. Zhous wife and son was announced on Mr. Xis 63rd birthday.News of the trials of Zhou Yongkangs wife and son was not made public, but neither were the trials a surprise. When Mr. Zhou was sentenced last June, the official news agency Xinhua said that Ms. Jia and Zhou Bin had accepted bribes amounting to more than $20 million.The elder Mr. Zhous downfall was especially thorough: Dozens of his close political associates have also been imprisoned, and several of his family members disappeared into police custody. A 2014 New York Times investigation found that relatives of Mr. Zhou, including Zhou Bin, his sister-in-law and several other family members, controlled stakes in dozens of companies across China with combined assets of at least $150 million. The whereabouts of a second son, Zhou Han, are not known.No pictures accompanied the terse announcement from the court on Ms. Jias sentencing. But Chinese state television did broadcast a clip from Zhou Bins trial. Balding, expressionless and bearing a striking resemblance to his square-jawed father, he was flanked by two police officers. He confessed to accepting more than $33 million in bribes and was fined more than $53 million, an indication of his wealth.The China Central Television report said that Zhou Bin had used his fathers power and status to accumulate wealth through bribes and that he had received a reduced sentence because he had confessed, had returned illegal gains and had expressed repentance.Ms. Jia also accepted her sentence, which included a fine amounting to about $152,000, the court said in its statement. Both said they would not appeal.Ms. Jia, who is believed to be 47, worked at China Central Television as a presenter and was Mr. Zhous second wife. His first wife, Wang Shuhua, died. Zhou Bin, 44, studied in Texas and married an American woman of Chinese descent who lived in Southern California. He was the majority owner in a Beijing company that sold oil-services equipment to a state-owned petroleum company once run by his father."}
{"text": "For years, Opening Ceremony, the pioneering New York concept store, has produced special collections for LGBT Pride Month. This years collection, a celebration of New Yorks historic gay bars, was well underway when the June 12 terrorist attack at Pulse, an Orlando, Fla., gay club, provided a chilling reminder of how crucial such clubs are as all-too-rare and fragile safe spaces for generations of gay men and women.For this Pride, I thought it would be a really good time to celebrate a lot of these founding places, said Humberto Leon, Opening Ceremonys co-founder, speaking by phone from Paris, where he will show the new Kenzo mens collection next week. As a gay man, these are all really important places.For Opening Ceremonys Pride capsule collection, Mr. Leon teamed with landmarks like the Stonewall Inn, favorites like the Eagle and the Monster, and the once-great, since-departed lesbian bars Meow Mix and Cattyshack on a limited collection of T-shirts, sweatshirts and caps. They are available at Opening Ceremony stores in New York and Los Angeles and online; prices range from $25 for a tank top to $60 for a hoodie. (All of the profits from the collections sales will go to a fund to benefit Pulse victims and their families.)In the days since the massacre, tributes to gay bars as havens have proliferated. But in recent years, many people have lamented the fading interest among younger generations in gay bars, scores of which have wilted in the digital glare of meet-ups-by-app. Mr. Leon, who spent early nights in New York at Julius and Barracuda, employs a young staff at Opening Ceremony and has witnessed the phenomenon firsthand.But where others see cause for complaint, Mr. Leon sees opportunity.More than half my store doesnt know what Julius is, doesnt know what the Monster is, he said. For me its exciting. Instead of thinking, How do you not know about that? its exciting to say, You have to check it out. This is my way of saying, Lets go.Discovery is one of the key words that we always try to think about at Opening Ceremony, he said. And rediscovering is as important as discovering something thats brand new."}
{"text": "FLORENCE, Italy  The 15th-century Palazzo Pitti, by the banks of the Arno, is one of the great storehouses of Italian Renaissance painting, an embarrassment of riches by Raphael, Titian and Tintoretto. But the fashion industry is never shy of gilding the lily. This week, on the occasion of the semiannual Pitti Uomo mens wear fair, an installation of photography by Karl Lagerfeld, fashions own Renaissance man, joined the work of the past masters, hanging or posted among them, beside them and, in some cases, over them.Karl Lagerfeld: Visions of Fashion catalogs a small part of the designers prodigious output, unparalleled among his fellow fashion polymaths.In 1984, for the shooting of the collection of Chanel, he was complaining to the director of images, said Gerhard Steidl, Mr. Lagerfelds publisher, who with Eric Pfrunder (that director of images for Chanel) curated the exhibition. Mr. Pfrunder told Mr. Lagerfeld, it would be best to buy you a camera to do the photo shootings yourself, Mr. Steidl added. Mr. Lagerfelds shutter has been blinking continuously since.About 200 photographs have been installed in light boxes or printed onto fluttering lengths of translucent paper (the same sort used for coffee filters, an exhibition coordinator said) and dangled from the ceiling of the palazzos Sala Bianca, one of the birthplaces of modern Italian fashion. They are images Mr. Lagerfeld has shot for Chanel (where he has been creative director since 1983) and Fendi (also creative director, since 1965) and for magazines like Numro, for which he gamely photographs the work of his fellow designers as well as his own.The show also includes selections from Mr. Lagerfelds personal photography, which he orchestrates for his own ends: A multipanel take on The Voyage of Ulysses; a retelling of the Greek romance of Daphnis and Chloe, starring Mr. Lagerfelds favorite model, Baptiste Giabiconi, in a loincloth of his design, as a youth being inducted into the mysteries of love. (A German voice narrates the accompanying soundtrack in a whisper.) Mr. Giabiconi also stars in The Beauty of Violence, a video and photograph series of paroxysms. Eike D. Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi Gallery, who also worked on the exhibition, connected it with 18th-century theories about expressive movement.Though, he added dryly about Mr. Giabiconis frantic and underdressed spasms, this is a 21st-century version.Mr. Lagerfeld famously avoids looking to the past. This is one of the sicknesses of our period, to look back, he said in an interview last year. But Mr. Steidl said the designer was only too happy to sift through his photographs for the exhibition.From the beginning, he said, Yes, lets do it,  Mr. Steidl said. When we were looking through these photos and he selected them, we saw they had not aged at all. So it doesnt matter if you look back or not, if theres a future or the past, the photos have not aged. Thats it.Like Karl? Like Karl, he agreed.Mr. Lagerfeld was not present at the opening Tuesday night; other duties are keeping him in Paris until Thursday, when he is due to arrive in Florence. But he did appear in the exhibition in a large digital self-portrait hanging in one of the galleries among Renaissance treasures  above, and several times the size of, one of the great Raphael portraits, La Velata.However the Italian masters might have felt about that juxtaposition, guests sipping aperitivi on the palazzos terrace appreciated it.It Italy, they can be very conservative about classic art, said Erica Pelosini, the jean-shorts clad Florentine firecracker behind Louis Leeman shoes, with a touch of chagrin. Its rare to find modern photography. Its a perfect mix."}
{"text": "Nick Denton has been relatively quiet since his company, Gawker Media, filed for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale on Friday, posting just a handful of tweets.But, in typical Denton fashion, his silence did not last long.On Wednesday, Mr. Denton, the founder and chief executive of Gawker, published a roughly 3,000-word blog post about the state of his company. He waxed poetic about the companys future, opined on the balance of power between privacy and a free press and took Silicon Valley billionaires to task for trying to control their image. Though the post was at times rambling, Mr. Dentons message was insistent: Gawker will be just fine.These were defiant words after what has been a tumultuous month for Gawker. In late May, it was revealed that the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel was secretly providing financing for lawsuits against the company, including one brought by the retired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The company faces a $140 million judgment in that case.But Mr. Denton expressed hope in a new owner, and the possibility that the court penalty will be reduced on appeal. Its sites, he said, will thrive under new ownership, with management oversight and financial underpinning from a larger company, he wrote. He added, We remain confident that justice will be done in the Hulk Hogan case.Still, in a candid acknowledgment of Gawkers circumstances, Mr. Denton said Mr. Thiels involvement had been financially draining and had undoubtedly depressed Gawker Media Groups valuation.Whoever buys us, he wrote, it will not be for the sort of headline price that Henry Blodget or Arianna Huffington received when selling Business Insider to Axel Springer and Huffington Post to AOL. Mr. Denton echoed that idea earlier on Wednesday when he was asked on CNBC about a $90 million opening bid from the digital media company Ziff Davis. (Business Insider sold a controlling stake to Axel Springer for $343 million, and Huffington Post was sold for $315 million).Lawyers for Gawker and Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, met in bankruptcy court in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday. During the hearing, which lasted about two hours, a judge approved certain business expenses for Gawker. The judge also extended a temporary restraining order to July 13 that barred Mr. Bollea from collecting damages from Mr. Denton and Albert J. Daulerio, Gawker.coms former editor in chief.Despite the trying times, Mr. Denton was optimistic in his post. The spirit that animates Gawker remains strong, he wrote. Its business as usual.But his assurance was also offset by a sense of uncertainty. When writing about the fate of Gawkers sites under a potential acquisition by Ziff Davis, Mr. Denton mentioned only one of the companys blogs by name, the technology-focused Gizmodo. That could further fuel speculation that Mr. Denton himself would try to buy back Gawker.com, which has been criticized at times for publishing articles that embarrassed people publicly while offering little news value.Mr. Denton coyly addressed those rumors. If it does not fit an acquirers portfolio, Gawker.com will find an investor with a tolerance for controversy, he wrote. I will happily contribute."}

She called me on a Friday and said, Its about to be summer, and its too hot to go then, and who knows how different itll be by the fall, so we booked it. And they were en route to Havana two weeks later.The duo roamed the Old City, admiring both the historic architecture and automobiles, stopped by the studio belonging to the Cuban contemporary artist Glenda Leon, shadowed local fan-painters and printmakers and browsed the bookstores. They also caught the ferry to Regla, a residential neighborhood left untouched by tourism, and toured Finca Vigia, Ernest Hemingways former home, just east of Havana  with Najafi documenting it all. Looking at my photographs, the bright color combinations were so stunning; normally, for me, gray is a color and medium gray is wild, says Najafi, who wore a pair of white jeans, of her own design, every day of her trip.

{"text": "After decades spent transforming the tenets of mens wear for women, imbuing the traditional Savile Row trouser suit with a sexual insouciance, Stella McCartney is finally doing the inevitable: making mens wear for actual men. On Thursday  as the mens fashion circus swirled in Florence at the Pitti Uomo trade fair  the designer confirmed long-rumored plans for a mens line, to debut Nov. 10 in London alongside her spring womens collection, the one that used to be presented in May but that has now moved to a see-now/buy-now schedule, with the show taking place just before the clothes go on public sale. Similarly, the mens wear will be sold a month after the big reveal, hitting shelves in early December.The desire to marry the Stella woman to a man has been inside me since the very beginning, said Ms. McCartney, herself a Stella woman married to a man, on announcing the news.My time on Savile Row  she trained with the tailor Edward Sexton after graduating from Central St. Martins  inspired so much of what I do, and it feels like the right moment to talk to men and give them what they deserve, she said. I want to deliver to men what I deliver to women.And what is that?A wardrobe, a choice and effortless modern clothes, she said.Translation: Like her womens wear, the mens wear will be leather- and shearling-free, and, like her womens wear, it will be a full collection, encompassing suits and separates, outerwear and accessories; eyewear is in the works.However, unlike her womens wear, the mens collection will not be associated with any particular season: The line, which will continue to be shown with Ms. McCartneys pre-collections and not on the classic mens wear schedule, will be called something like Collection One and Collection Two (it will be sold to wholesalers a few months before it is shown to the press and public). The theory is that men buy differently from women: They see something, and if they like it, they want to get it immediately. And they do not think in trends.As to what the clothes might look like, thats still a secret. But some clues may be found in Ms. McCartneys past.The designer has dabbled in mens wear before, making suits for both her husband, Alasdhair Willis (a jazzy midnight-blue double-breasted tuxedo with black lapels), and her father, Paul McCartney (a single-breasted tartan tux atop classic black trousers), to wear to the Met Gala in 2011. She has done bespoke pieces for Guy Ritchie and David Bowie, and she makes all the competition and off-duty Olympic Village clothing, including some urban athleisure sweats, for the male and female members of Britains Olympic team in collaboration with Adidas. The overall look for both is kind of tailored, no-fuss hipster.If those men buy it, why wouldnt everyone else?After all, there is nothing new about brands making their names in womens wear and then segueing into the mens market, often very successfully, much like Lanvin, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton. And though all those brands have named mens wear designers running the mens side of the business (Lucas Ossendrijver, Kris Van Assche and Kim Jones), Miuccia Prada has been as influential in mens wear design as she has been in womens wear, and at Herms, the long-term mens creative director, Vronique Nichanian, has given the mens line its own clear identity.The biggest risk may lie in the fact that Ms. McCartney has built her identity as a designer on the idea of being a woman designing for women, as she told The Guardian in 2014, and there is some ambivalence around how that will translate for men. Part of her calling card has been a willingness to eschew capital-f Fashion statement-making for real life statement-making, focusing on clothes that allow a customer to move seamlessly from breakfast waffles to power meeting to margaritas in Ibiza with seemingly effortless aplomb. Thats not necessarily a gender-specific aesthetic, but it has been sold that way in the past.Of course, we no longer live in such gender-specific days. So perhaps the real question is: What took her so long?"}
{"text": "CLEVELAND  Draymond Green, fresh off his one-game suspension, returned to Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday afternoon, and he had some things he wanted to say.So Green, the emotional leader of the Golden State Warriors and a vital cog in their pursuit of a second straight N.B.A. championship, took a seat at the center of a scrum of 50-odd reporters and listened to the first question, which was a two-parter: Would it be difficult for him to move past the suspension, and what sort of reaction would he expect from the crowd when the Warriors faced the Cavaliers on Thursday night in Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals?What followed was a 482-word monologue in which Green touched on topics that included his emotional state (I let my teammates down), the justice that the league had meted out (Everybodys going to have their opinion on it), his distant view of Game 5 from a luxury suite at a baseball game (I thank the people over at the As for having me) and his regrettable absence as the Warriors lost without him.I have a strong belief that if I play in Game 5, we win, he said.Green, whose larynx was as strong as ever, was suspended for a collection of flagrant fouls that included a general failure to avoid punching and kicking opponents in the groin. He will presumably return to the starting lineup on Thursday as the Warriors seek to close out the Cavaliers. Golden State has a three-games-to-two lead in the best-of-seven series.I learned a lot, said Green, whose flagrant foul on the Cavaliers LeBron James in Game 4 brought about an automatic suspension. You cant put yourself in certain positions. One thing that Ive already been kind of teaching myself and trying to learn how to do is control my emotions.Green said he felt like a bad teammate for not being available to play. I take pride in being a good teammate, he said.The league barred Green from attending Game 5 at Oracle Arena on Monday, so he made arrangements to watch the game on television at the Oakland Coliseum, where the Athletics were hosting the Texas Rangers. He was joined by Bob Myers, the Warriors general manager, whose presence, Green said, helped soften a tough situation.It was brutal, Green said. Just the entire day knowing I cant go out there and help my guys. I cant even be around. Its one thing if youre out with an injury. Its another thing if youre out because of suspension. Its a brutal day.The Warriors Stephen Curry said he had visions of Green sprinting across the parking lot and bursting into Oracle to celebrate with his teammates  had they won, of course. Instead, the Cavaliers extended the series with a 112-97 victory that underscored Greens importance. James, who scored 41 points, found his path to the basket unimpeded.It wasnt an ideal situation to not have him out there, Curry said. Hopefully, hes not put in that situation again where hes putting his playing status in jeopardy.The Warriors need Green now more than ever. Andrew Bogut, the teams starting center, was ruled out for the rest of the series after sustaining bone bruises to his left knee in Game 5. The Warriors said in a statement that the injury would not require surgery but that Bogut would need six to eight weeks to recover.Its bad news for our team, Coach Steve Kerr said. Hes a defensive presence at the rim and rebounder, and a great passer. So well miss the minutes that hes giving us.The Warriors will probably not have much of a choice but to go small with Green at center, which tends to be their most effective lineup anyway  but typically in short bursts.At least the situation will feel vaguely familiar to the Warriors, who clinched last years championship in Game 6  in Cleveland.Its an amazing feeling when you can quiet 20,000 screaming fans and celebrate on their floor, Green said. Its hard. Thats what makes it feel even better, because its so much harder. We know the formula. We know the blueprint.A big part of which involves Green actually being in the building."}
{"text": "With New York Citys subway trains jammed to capacity and more people than ever pouring into neighborhoods outside Manhattan, Mayor Bill de Blasio is embarking on an ambitious and expensive plan to create a fleet of city-owned ferryboats that would crisscross the surrounding waterways and connect all five boroughs.At a cost of more than $325 million, Mr. de Blasios expansion of ferry service would be one of the biggest bets any city in the world has made on boats as vehicles for mass transit. The mayor predicts that the ferries would carry 4.5 million passengers a year, about twice as many riders as San Franciscos ferry system handles.Mr. de Blasio has promised New Yorkers that ferries will start running on three new routes, serving South Brooklyn, and Astoria and the Rockaways in Queens, by the end of June 2017, four months before he would stand for re-election. Additional routes to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and to Soundview in the Bronx will be added in 2018.Our aim is to make this thing as big as possible, said Alicia Glen, the citys deputy mayor for housing and economic development. No guts, no glory.Simply put, city officials believe that if New York is to continue thriving, it must have a robust transportation network and that ferries can play a critical role, just as they do in many waterfront cities around the globe.Were still living with the footprint of an early-19th-century transit map that didnt contemplate the kind of job growth were seeing along the waterfront, Ms. Glen said. The administration, she said, is trying to create a transportation network for the new New York.The city has already spent $6 million on four commuter boats in 2016 and could own more than 30 in a few years. Mr. de Blasio also plans to spend at least $85 million to create 13 additional landings for the ferries and a home port for them at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.But the mayor has raised the stakes in ways few other places have by pledging that a ferry ride would cost the same as subway fare, $2.75. That is a departure from San Francisco; Sydney, Australia; and other cities where extensive commuter-ferry systems have long operated. They tend to charge more to ride ferries than buses or trains, and their ferry fares are based on the length of the trip.The one-fare plan fits with the liberal agenda of Mr. de Blasio, who has championed transit equity for all New Yorkers. To fulfill the mayors promise, the city will have to contribute a substantial operating subsidy, a commitment that several of his predecessors were unwilling to make.Mr. de Blasios former rival for the mayors job, Christine C. Quinn, applauded his embrace of ferries as a form of mass transit. Theres a little bit of a whimsical, historic notion of ferries; they seem to be a lot more fun than other modes of transportation, said Ms. Quinn, the former City Council speaker. You dont want ferries to just be the fun, fancy transport of people with money.Of course, New Yorks waters were once clogged with ferries. In the early 1900s, when there were few bridges and no car tunnels, as many as 147 boats carried people across the Hudson and East Rivers.The only vestige of that era is the Staten Island Ferry, nine hulking boats that make regularly scheduled point-to-point crossings of New York Harbor. For routes from Brooklyn and Queens, city officials have largely relied on private companies operating their own ferries to deliver workers to Manhattan every weekday.City officials have been leaning on Hornblower Cruises and Events, the San Francisco-based company they chose in March to operate the service, to order the boats it will need. Hornblower, which runs cruises to the Statue of Liberty, has settled on a design for 149-passenger boats and is negotiating with a few boatyards around the country to build 18 of them, at a cost of nearly $4 million each.One of the challenges is to stand up a new fleet, said Terry MacRae, Hornblowers chief executive. But its better than bringing a bunch of widows and orphans together, he said, alluding to the alternative of rounding up a group of used boats.Cameron Clark, who is overseeing the start of the ferry service for Hornblower, said the 85-foot boats were designed by Incat Crowther, an Australian company, to be fuel-efficient and spacious. The first of them are scheduled to be completed early next year, he said.They will have all the 21st-century stuff, Mr. Clark said, including Wi-Fi and power outlets for laptop computers.Maria Torres-Springer, the president of the citys Economic Development Corporation, said Hornblower was chosen primarily for its experience in starting ferry services around the country, as well as on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. The company, however, has limited experience with helping commuters get to and from work every day, though city officials said that did not weigh heavily against it.The citys choice of Hornblower stirred some controversy, including warnings from another ferry operator, New York Water Taxi, that it would go out of business after losing its bid for the citys contract.Billybey Ferry, a part of the New Jersey-based New York Waterway, has been operating the subsidized East River Ferry service for the city since 2011. That service will be integrated into the citywide system after this year and will be operated by Hornblower at a reduced fare equal to a MetroCard swipe, city officials said.Paul Goodman, the chief executive of Billybey, said his company was disappointed to lose the bid. But, he added, Were still big believers in the expansion of ferry service and we hope that its a success.Mr. de Blasio announced that the home port for the expanded service would be a pier in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But that pier is so dilapidated that it may not be rebuilt before 2018, Ms. Glen said. If the city-owned service starts next summer, as scheduled, the home port is likely to be in New Jersey at first, Ms. Glen said. The citys ferry system, however, will not serve New Jersey.Homeporting is a terrific benefit of the system, Ms. Glen said, adding that it would create jobs in Brooklyn and save on fuel costs. If that takes another nine months, thats not the priority.Hornblower will need nine boats to cover the three new routes, none of which it has now.Mike Anderson, former chief executive of Washington State Ferries, which runs a large fleet of ferries in the Seattle area, said that to have that many boats built would normally take a few years. But Hornblower hopes to cut that schedule to one year by using three or more shipyards, including two on the Gulf Coast, Mr. Clark said.Thats a bit of a heavy lift, said Mr. Anderson, an executive with KPFF Consulting Engineers who consulted with New York City on its plan.Everything has to go right and they need to get started pretty soon.City officials have made provisions for delays in the production of new boats, allowing Hornblower to charter additional boats to get the service started.The city estimates that it will cost about $70 million to have 18 ferries built. Once they are done, the city plans to buy them from Hornblower, which will operate them for six years, with a possibility of renewing the contract for an additional five years.Ms. Glen said the city was employing good, smart economics in deciding to own the boats. If, for some reason, Hornblower doesnt perform, she said, the city would either find another operator or run the system itself, as it does for the Staten Island Ferry. And, she added, even if the service werent to be that successful, the city will have hard assets that it could sell to recoup some of its investment.Before the service begins, Ms. Torres-Springer hopes to find one or more sponsors for it similar to the Citi Bike bike-sharing program. But, she added, it would be premature to call the ferries Citi Boats."}

And put on those headsets.An immersive stage show that makes heavy use of binaural technology (3-D audio) for drama is coming to Broadway this fall after a sold-out run in London and arts festival appearances throughout Europe.The Encounter, inspired by Petru Popescus novel Amazon Beaming, is loosely about a National Geographic photographers experience with a mystical tribe in Brazil in 1969. But, as directed and performed by the British director Simon McBurney, it is also an exploration of the nature of reality, and the meaning of storytelling.I became fascinated with the whole process of memory  what the relationship is between the actual way memory works in the brain, and the effect of that in our lives, Mr. McBurney said in a telephone interview. I had this story, and my own personal obsession, and they started to wind around each other like a double helix, and gradually I began to find a form which seemed to me to be deeply dramatic and theatrical  compelling as a story, but also as a set of things that provoke and question the imagination of the audience.Mr. McBurney, who created the show for Complicite, a company he co-founded, said The Encounter is partly about solitude. It is very intimate, because of the technology, and I want people to go on that journey, he said.The show began its life last summer at the Edinburgh International Festival, and then was staged at the Barbican Theater in London early this year; it has also been performed at festivals in Britain, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, France and the Netherlands. In a review of the London production in The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that The Encounter is one of the most fully immersive theater pieces ever created and described it as a journey to the center of your mind that begins in your auditory nerves and keeps burrowing deeper.The Broadway production will begin previews Sept. 20 and open Sept. 29 at the John Golden Theater; it is scheduled to run through Jan. 8. Mr. McBurney said he hoped to do most of the performances, but another actor, Richard Katz, will step in as needed. (Eight shows a week is steep with this show, Mr. McBurney said. Its difficult to explain, but its very tough.)Mr. McBurney has worked on Broadway twice before, as the director of a 1998 revival of The Chairs, by Eugene Ionesco, and of a 2008 revival of Arthur Millers All My Sons."}
{"text": "Four significant things happened in the last 24 hours of the 2016 presidential race:President Obama forcefully denounced Donald J. Trump, the Republican running to succeed him, for playing to the nations worst fears in the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Trump stood by his insinuations that Mr. Obama is sympathetic to terrorists.Hillary Clinton, defending Mr. Obama, whom she also wants to succeed, painted Mr. Trump as something of an oddball in addition to criticizing his statements about immigration and aggressively profiling Muslims. And yet another national poll, this time from Bloomberg Politics, showed Mrs. Clinton opening a double-digit lead over Mr. Trump.According to the survey, 63 percent of women said they could never vote for Mr. Trump, a staggeringly high number that presents him with a daunting challenge.Mr. Trumps drop in some national polls is most likely connected to self-inflicted wounds, including his comments that the Indiana-born federal judge overseeing a case against Trump University could not be partial because he was Mexican. But there is another explanation.Since shortly after Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee in early May, the super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA, has aired ads in battleground states portraying him as disrespectful and even offensive to women.Those ads have gone unanswered by Mr. Trumps campaign for a month now, as his team, plagued by internal battles, has struggled with fundamental staff moves, like naming a political director, and with raising money as donors decline to lend their names to fund-raising events."}

Over the past decade, through its own products and the many copycats that piled on, Apples device-centric aestheticism has made computers easier to use and more accessible to more people around the world  and raked in eye-popping profits while doing so.Yet Apples view increasingly feels like an outdated way of thinking about tech.Many of its competitors have been moving beyond devices toward experiences that transcend them. These new technologies exist not on distinct pieces of hardware, but above and within them. They are things like Alexa, Amazons ambient assistant, which lives on the internet and is ready to help you on the Amazon Echo but also on any other device that a programmer adds it to. In an era of flat iPhone sales, Apple, too, has been talking up the importance of online services, which it sees as a crucial part of its future growth.So the primary question Apple had to answer at its annual developer conference this week was whether it could expand its worldview. Could it break free from the limiting perspective of individual devices?The answer: Yes, but slowly  and its hard to tell if Apple is thinking big enough.What was obvious in the hurricane of new features unveiled by Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, and his lieutenants was that they understood the importance of cloud-based services. Many of Apples announcements featured some role for the internet to integrate peoples experiences on disparate Apple devices, often with the help of artificial intelligence.But a lot of these features felt small bore. Apple still seems to view online services as add-ons to its devices  not as products or platforms that rise above them. The best way to see the shortcomings of this position is through Siri, the voice assistant that is Apples best chance to create the kind of transcendent, cross-device experience that its competitors are now pushing.Analysts and developers were expecting big improvements to Siri. Apple did show off a way for some apps to integrate with Siri and for Siri to perform a few new functions on Apple TV; Siri also found a new home on Macintosh computers. But the way Apple presented the changes, with each Siri advance positioned as a feature of one of Apples devices, left unclear what Apples ultimate aims were for the voice assistant.The new features fall short of remaking Siri into something fundamentally different from what it is today. Siri, as Apple is positioning it, is becoming a better app launcher for your phone  you can use it to call for an Uber ride or to respond to a message. But its not clear that its becoming a truly intelligent assistant, one that understands you across your devices, that can comprehend complex queries and get things done for you regardless of which apps you happen to have installed on any particular machine.These shortcomings are not terrible. Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally.Before we get to the limitations, here are the details on whats new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some third-party apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice  in the past, you could do so only with Apples own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout.Siris other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance.These are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out. One problem is that the new Siri will not integrate with all kinds of apps. It will be able to control only a handful of app types, including messaging apps, ride-sharing apps, payment apps and fitness apps. Yet Siri wont let you control music apps, for example  you cant ask Siri to play a song on Spotify, a feature reserved for use with Apples own music subscription service.This limitation could be relaxed with time. Apple reps told me the third-party integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort  one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. Its hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up.Another problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesnt really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac cant. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone cant.For now, this isnt a big problem  you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But thats a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why cant she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using?The device-centric view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, Can you see if theres a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend  and can you book it if its less than $200 a night?Google, in its demo for Home, a forthcoming voice assistant device meant to rival Amazons Echo, seemed to be able to handle such questions. Two start-ups  Viv, which was founded by members of the team that created the original Siri app that Apple bought in 2010, and SoundHound have also unveiled systems that can tackle such complex queries.To handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldnt make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed; ideally, it should work on any device.And that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload  there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that hotel-booking app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone?Voice interfaces could usher in a new paradigm in computing, one that would break free of the tyranny of apps on devices. They could get a lot done for us without much tapping and switching. Google, Amazon and several start-ups seem to be rushing headlong to build such a system.But based on its developer conference, Im not sure Apple is. Its taking a more moderate app-based, device-centric path. Many of its voice features will be fine  useful, even. But it sure isnt pushing for a revolution."}
{"text": "This is the buzz saw that Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, walked into as she addressed the news media  and by extension, every trading floor on earth  Wednesday afternoon.The Feds official mission is to take care of the American economy, and the economy is doing pretty well. The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, its lowest in nine years and around the level Federal Reserve officials think is sustainable in the long run. Wages are rising steadily. After a soft first quarter, economic growth is accelerating.For Ms. Yellen, a labor economist with decades of experience, it all points to a recipe for higher inflation, a single month of weak jobs data notwithstanding. Some of her colleagues would also emphasize that keeping rates too low could create imbalances in the economy and spur new financial crises.But global financial markets arent having it. If you take bond and currency markets at face value, the underlying path of growth in the United States is too weak and global deflationary forces too powerful; the Fed will need to raise interest rates much slower than its officials say they expect.If markets could talk, they would be saying: We dont think youll raise interest rates as much as you say, and if you do it anyway youll probably regret it.All 17 top officials of the Fed expect an interest rate increase to happen this year, according to projections they released Wednesday. Yet financial futures markets price in only about a 40 percent chance that it will happen. Fed officials envision a 2.4 percent interest rate target at the end of 2018, versus 0.6 percent that is priced into the markets. Fed officials see inflation rising to its target of 2 percent by 2018 and staying there; the price of inflation-protected bonds implies it will be much lower.There are technical factors that distort those market signals, as Ms. Yellen noted in her news conference. For example, aggressive bond-buying by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan may be sending money flooding across borders into higher-yielding American bonds, making American rates lower than the economic fundamentals would justify.But even with those distortions, Ms. Yellen and the Fed face danger if they ignore these market signals entirely. A pattern has repeated for years: Markets expect slower growth, lower inflation and a slower path of rate increases than Fed officials themselves; markets turn out to be right.Two years ago, for example, the median projection among Fed officials was that its interest rate target would be 2.5 percent at the end of 2016. A year ago it was 1.68 percent at the end of 2016. Now both look like pipe dreams. Fed leaders expect a 0.9 percent rate at the end of the year, and markets expect 0.4 percent.Ms. Yellen and the Fed have been grappling with which set of signals to listen to, and the tone that pervaded her news conference Wednesday was one of uncertainty.Were quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term, she said. Many of us believe as a base case its reasonable to assume those rates will move up over time, but we arent certain about that. There could be revisions in either direction.Ultimately, by holding off on a June rate increase and marking down rate forecasts for the months ahead, the Fed nudged its views toward market views.As Fed officials make their decisions at their remaining four meetings of 2016, the issue that hangs over them is as complex as ever. It is not merely about evaluating how the United States economy is doing and whether it remains solidly on track  and given the flaws in economic data, that job is hard enough.Fed officials must also weigh whether the global force of low inflation is so powerful as to continue dragging down prices in the United States even after the domestic economy has healed. They have to figure out whether the feedback loops between economic weakness and easy money in other countries create unconventional risks to the United States by raising rates too quickly.The 2008 financial crisis was a profound test of the Feds ability to prevent economic collapse; from 2009 to 2012, the central bank made crucial decisions to keep pushing the United States economy toward recovery.This year is showing just how intricate the exit from this era of easy money will truly be."}
{"text": "BEIJING  One of Chinas best-known imprisoned dissidents, Yang Maodong, is putting his already fragile health at risk after weeks on a hunger strike, his wife and sister said on Wednesday, after his sister said she had unsuccessfully asked the prison authorities to be allowed to see him and beg him to stop fasting.Mr. Yang, better known by his pen name, Guo Feixiong, has been among Chinas most persistent and combative campaigners for expanding democratic rights, and he has continued his resistance while confined in Guangdong Province in southern China. For more than a month, he has refrained from eating to protest his conditions, especially what he said was a humiliating rectal examination, and to demand sweeping political change, according to his family.During a routine monthly visit from his brother last week, Mr. Yang, 49, appeared to have lost a great deal of weight, which may have exacerbated his chronic illnesses, his sister, Yang Maoping, said by telephone on Wednesday, as she waited at the prison in the hope of seeing him.I want to tell him to stop the hunger striking, Ms. Yang said. But they have said they have laws and regulations to follow, and this breaks the rule of a visit once a month. I want to beg him to stop before he really puts himself in danger.Mr. Yangs wife, Zhang Qing, who lives in Midland, Tex., with their two children, said by telephone that her husband had declared on May 9 that he would refuse to eat. Although the family could not be sure if he had eaten occasionally or was being force-fed, his severe weight loss was alarming and she had written to him urging him to begin eating again, she said.Yesterday, the prison management said they would pass him my letter begging him to stop hunger striking, Ms. Zhang said.He was not well when he saw his big brother last week, rambling and difficult to follow, and were worried about what will happen, she said. He can be very determined.Mr. Yang, formerly a stocky man of about 150 pounds, had recently shed about a third of that weight, said Ms. Zhang, citing estimates from her brother-in-law who had visited him. Officers who took calls at the Yangchun Prison in Guangdong, where Mr. Yang is being held, refused to answer questions or referred calls to another number.Mr. Yangs latest protest has prompted international concern, as well as fasting protests to support him in China and abroad. A spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing, Benjamin Weber, said on Wednesday, We urge China to release him immediately on humanitarian grounds.The Chinese government appears extremely unlikely to do that. Under President Xi Jinping, the authorities have pursued an intense drive of detentions, trials and convictions to stifle political dissent.Mr. Yangs fasting is the latest episode in a career of dissent punctuated by run-ins with the government and a previous term in prison. He started as a publisher and writer before devoting himself to political activism.He first won national prominence among rights advocates in 2005 for helping to organize villagers near Guangzhou to protest what they said were corrupt land seizures. While other advocates used court cases and lobbying as attempts at expanding citizens rights, Mr. Yang was among those who favored street action and public gestures.He was convicted and imprisoned in 2007 on charges of illegal business activities because of his publishing. After his release in 2011, he resumed political agitation, and in January 2013, he was among the activists in Guangzhou who offered support to journalists there protesting what they called the heavy-handed censorship of an editorial in the newspaper Southern Weekend.Mr. Yang was detained by the police in August 2013. In November 2015, he was sentenced to six years in prison on charges of disturbing public order and picking quarrels and provoking trouble, a sweeping charge often leveled at dissidents, for his role in two peaceful protests in 2013. After his arrest in August that year, Mr. Yang also held a hunger strike, one of his lawyers said at the time.Late on Wednesday, Mr. Yangs sister said that she had not been allowed to visit her brother, but prison officers had shown her a note, which they said was from Mr. Yang, in which he vowed to continue refusing food.Because none of his demands have been met, he cannot halt his hunger strike, Ms. Yang said, summarizing her brothers message, which she was not allowed to keep or copy."}
{"text": "Fallout continues over the controversial Stanford sexual assault case. Here are highlights of the latest developments: In an unusual move, prosecutors on Tuesday had Judge Aaron Persky of the Santa Clara County Superior Court removed from hearing a case in which a male nurse was accused of sexually assaulting an anesthetized female patient.Prosecutors filed a peremptory challenge to Judge Persky after he dismissed charges against a woman in an unrelated misdemeanor theft trial on Monday. That objection automatically prevented him from presiding over a preliminary hearing in the sexual assault case.We are disappointed and puzzled at Judge Perskys unusual decision to unilaterally dismiss a case before the jury could deliberate, the Santa Clara district attorney, Jeff Rosen, said in a statement. After this and the recent turn of events, we lack confidence that Judge Persky can fairly participate in this upcoming hearing in which a male nurse sexually assaulted an anesthetized female patient.The nurse, Cecil Webb, is accused of touching the genitals and breasts of a sedated woman in 2014 at Kaiser Permanentes Santa Clara Medical Center, according to The San Jose Mercury News. He was charged with a felony count of sexual battery.The backlash has also grown over what critics have denounced as the judges too-lenient sentence this month for Brock Allen Turner, 20, a former Stanford student and champion swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an intoxicated, unconscious woman behind a Dumpster in January 2015.Judge Persky, 54, had been harshly criticized, and even threatened, for sentencing Mr. Turner to six months in jail and three years probation for three felony counts: intent to commit rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration with a foreign object of an unconscious person. On Monday, The Palo Alto Weekly published a scathing anonymous letter from a juror in the Stanford case who said he was absolutely shocked and appalled by the sentence. The publication said it had verified the letter writers identity by inspecting his court-issued attendance certificate.After the guilty verdict, I expected that this case would serve as a very strong deterrent to on-campus assaults, but with the ridiculously lenient sentence that Brock Turner received, I am afraid that it makes a mockery of the whole trial and the ability of the justice system to protect victims of assault and rape, the juror wrote. Clearly there are few to no consequences for a rapist even if they are caught in the act of assaulting a defenseless, unconscious person. At least 16 potential jurors have refused to work with Judge Persky in the theft trial because they said they were uneasy about his sentence in the Stanford sexual assault case.I cant believe what you did, one juror said to the judge.The judge responded to each complaint with I understand, and dismissed the potential jurors. Eighteen members of the House took turns on Wednesday night reading portions of the courtroom statement by the Stanford victim. Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, organized the reading and is the sponsor of legislation that would require the Department of Education to provide a list of institutions under investigation over sexual assaults."}
{"text": "The world may need to get ready for more megaslumps.A slump occurs when permafrost, or frozen ground, thaws and collapses. Most are between two and 20 meters deep, according to Julian Murton, a geologist who studies slumps. But some are much bigger  slumps more than 25 meters deep are called megaslumps. One of these, the Batagaika crater in Siberia, was about 52 meters (170 feet) deep when Prof. Murtons team measured it in May. According to Motherboard, at least seven other craters, one of them more than half a mile in diameter, have appeared in the area.When the ground collapses, said Ted Schuur, an ecologist who studies permafrost thawing, everything that was living there usually gets wiped out. Animals like caribou can get stuck in the muddy bottom of a slump and die, said Prof. Murton. Roads, airstrips, pipelines or other manmade structures on top of a slump can be damaged too, he added.Slumps, which also occur in Canada and Alaska, are likely to become more common as the Arctic warms. And as permafrost thaws, Prof. Schuur explained, it releases greenhouse gases that can accelerate climate change. This raises the possibility of a feedback loop in which thawing leads to higher temperatures and still more thawing.Researchers need to study permafrost to determine which areas are richest in ice, said Prof. Schuur, since these are the most vulnerable to slumping. And authorities in the far northern parts of the world should examine roads and other infrastructure to determine if theyre at risk of being damaged by slumps.Protecting plant life may help prevent slumps  plants on top of permafrost can keep it cool, Prof. Murton explained. The Batagaika crater developed after trees on the site were cut down.But the best way to stop more craters from forming is also the most politically difficult: reducing carbon emissions to keep the ground from warming any more than it already has."}
{"text": "CALLS to resist politicizing tragedy have become a standard feature of our political discourse following mass shootings. From Newtown, Conn., to Aurora, Colo., politicians and pundits have urged us to refrain from politics as predictably as they have offered hollow thoughts and prayers as a condolence to victims and their families.The tragedy in Orlando that claimed the lives of 49 people at a gay nightclub has proved no different. When Senator Bernie Sanders used his time on NBCs Meet the Press Sunday to call for a ban on automatic weapons, the host, Chuck Todd, asked pointedly whether it was possible to discuss the shooting without trying to politicize one version of events over the other? Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate, sounded a similar note when he told The Washington Post that the current moment was not a time to either politicize or jump to conclusions.But it is only the most privileged among us who have the luxury of divorcing politics from everyday life. Those of us in the L.G.B.T. community know better. Politics is how we won the right to be free from discrimination in government jobs, to have sex without fear of criminal prosecution, to serve in the military, to get married and adopt children. In about 28 states, we are still fighting to outlaw discrimination in employment. And transgender Americans are still fighting for the right to pee in peace.To think that a mass shooting at a gay nightclub filled with Latinos and committed by a Muslim-American sympathetic to religious extremists is beyond the scope of politics is absurd on its face  you couldnt dream up a scenario more rife with political implications. But it is especially absurd to those of us in the L.G.B.T. community, whose very existence has been politicized for decades.However personal, tragedy is no occasion to withdraw from public life. Quite the contrary: When the AIDS epidemic struck the gay community in the 1980s, gay men mourning the deaths of lovers and friends did not turn inward. They turned to the streets, unleashing one of the modern eras largest and most effective protest movements. Because of their efforts, the federal government changed the way it tested and released lifesaving drugs.Its easy to forget that 10 years ago, the partners of victims in Orlandos shooting might not have been permitted to visit their loved ones in hospitals. It is because of the L.G.B.T. movements political mobilization that we can now stand beside wounded lovers in hospital beds.If people dying of AIDS or facing discrimination can channel their outrage into political action, why shouldnt the 49 victims gunned down on Sunday become political symbols?For those directly affected by mass violence, the desire to avoid politics is about giving victims and their loved ones space to grieve and reflect. The political classs stubborn refusal to connect what goes on in Washington to the way life is lived, and ended, reflects something far less noble.Many journalists and politicians have become accustomed not only to seeing politics as mere theater  a source of television ratings, fodder for books and news stories  but as an insiders game. When politics is the domain of the elite, its natural to think the relentless churn of the Beltway commentariat has nothing to do with a mass murder in Florida.Americans have learned to feel helpless in the face of mass shootings. But the triumphs of the L.G.B.T.-rights movement show that it is possible to change stagnant systems, even radically. But it requires more than a momentary outburst of resolve whenever crisis hits. Changing public opinion and our laws to recognize the humanity of our community happened only after a sustained campaign across decades that included the efforts of countless grass-roots organizers, activists, lawyers, lobbyists, writers and advocates. It will take an organizing effort on a similar scale to stop anyone with a cause, a grudge or simply a screw loose from being able to obtain the tools for mass murder.The disgust that the Orlando gunman Omar Mateen reportedly felt at seeing two gay men kiss in front of his son was political, the product of a culture where leaders have for decades compared same-sex love to bestiality, portrayed gay people as threats to children and passed laws to stop them from adopting and even marrying.That Mr. Mateen was able to purchase a weapon of mass murder capable of shooting over 20 rounds in nine seconds  the civilian version of a military weapon  is also the product of our politics, which makes no distinction between guns that can be used for sport and self-defense and those designed to take as many lives as possible in a short amount of time. A tragedy with political causes has political solutions.L.G.B.T. organizers know from experience that theater is part of politics. When activists from the H.I.V.-AIDS advocacy group Act Up stormed the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1980s, part of their goal was to create a scene in order to capture the medias attention. But it was not spectacle for its own sake. The ultimate goal was to change policy. Given the amount of energy the Beltway expends on Donald J. Trumps latest zinger, it may be tempting to think that its all just for show. But the consequences of our political actions  and inaction  are as real as the bullets in Mr. Mateens weapon."}
{"text": "Last week, the Parisian gallerist Almine Rech announced that her son, Paul de Froment, will be the director of her forthcoming New York outpost. The news brought to mind another recent opening: Lissons New York gallery, where the second-generation dealer Alex Logsdail serves as the international director. His father, the British art dealer Nicholas Logsdail, co-founded Lisson in 1967, brought Alex into the business in 2009 and made him director in 2011. Logsdail and Rech are not alone: many major players, including David Zwirner, Arne Glimcher and Sean Kelly, have made room for their children in their businesses.As the son of Arne Glimcher  the dealer who nurtured the careers of Robert Rauschenberg and Jean Dubuffet  Pace president Marc Glimcher now effectively runs his fathers international gallery. Schooled in molecular biology and immunology, Marc initially stayed away from the gallery at his fathers request, but found himself habitually returning. At some point, if your parent is Arne Glimcher or Paula Cooper or Rudolf Zwirner, you have to confront two things. You have to come to peace with the idea that youre going to do the same thing that your father did, and your father was pretty great at it, Marc says. You also have to come to grips with the fact that he started it from scratch and you are never going to do that. Its an internal struggle that took me 20 years to untangle.Marc had to call in his longtime friend, Matthew Marks, to vouch for him, but eventually convinced Arne. When my children were little, I said Id support them with anything but coming into Pace, Arne says. If anything, Marc did this in spite of me. He has very much his own identity, and I feel at this point that I work for Marc more than he works for me. Im very privileged. Marcs first assignment, a book on Picassos sketchbooks, eventually led him to start a publishing house of his own, called Second Sons.Lucas Zwirner, 25, is attempting to do the same thing at the recently established David Zwirner Books, the imprint of his fathers namesake gallery. A third-generation gallerist, Lucas will inevitably face the same scrutiny his father endured in trying to outrun the legacy of Rudolf Zwirner, the legendary German dealer who revolutionized Cologne with artists like Cy Twombly and Joseph Beuys in the 60s. I look at it this way, the publishing house is this post that every artist passes through. Over the course of five years, youve probably worked with 80 percent of the artists in the gallery stable, says Lucas, who studied philosophy and literature. (Lucass younger sister is now interning at David Zwirners pop-up bookshop, too.)Communications departments are also a common entry point for art-dealer offspring. Lucas Cooper just recently left the music industry to help his mother, Paula Cooper, with press. And when Josie Nash started at her parents gallery, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, she worked in communications, though she has since graduated to associate director. Nash admits that she sought advice from Lauren Kelly, the daughter of Sean Kelly and director of his eponymous gallery  who was happy to share her experiences. Its definitely a learning curve, Lauren says. When Im interacting with Sean, hes my father first and foremost, but hes also my boss. Weve had to come to our own terms of what it means to be personal and professional.Any concerns the children have, the parents have twice over: Nepotism is a dirty word. Its incredibly complicated, because one has to wear all these different hats, Sean Kelly explains. One has to be a parent and a boss. You want your children to do a great job, but you dont want them to seem enfranchised in a way your other employees are not. It takes time, but when you get the balancing act right, its incredibly rich and rewarding. Kelly should know; both his children, Thomas and Lauren, have influenced the gallery and its ever-growing roster of artists. When she first joined, I was surprised by how much she already knew, Lucy Mitchell-Innes says of Josie. Children know their parents better than anyone else at the gallery, so they know in an unspoken way the viewpoint and value system of the gallery. Its not something that has to be learned.The phenomenon is evident across the art globe. The Brazilian gallerist Nara Roeslers sons, Alexandre and Daniel, have helped grow their mothers business into an international program. The Berlin-based dealer Max Hetzlers son, also named Max, is still in school, but works at the gallery in his spare time. Tina Kim, who operates an eponymous space in Chelsea, has carried the legacy of her mother, Hyun-Sook Lee, from Seoul to New York. Cristobal Riestra, of Mexico Citys Galera OMR, recently transitioned from being a director to a managing partner of the gallery, with his parents Patricia Ortiz Monasterio and Jaime Riestra now taking a more advisory role. Art Basel 2016, on now, is the first fair Cristobal has tackled on his own. I hope to develop the eye theyve had, because I think its priceless for any gallery, he says. I also hope I inherit their capacity for change. Its resilient to change, its how you stay relevant, especially in context of contemporary art."}
{"text": "I carefully unwrapped the lilac-colored tissue paper as my patient watched, expectantly. Given its size and shape, I was pretty sure I knew what was in this package.He was in his late 60s and had been coming to our cancer center for years  first for chemotherapy to treat his lymphoma, then for a bone marrow transplant when the chemotherapy didnt work. Now, cured of his lymphoma, he was in our clinic for the myelodysplastic syndrome that our treatments had caused. His bruised fingers, a consequence of the low platelets resulting from his failed bone marrow, tapped his knees impatiently until I uncovered his present.A tie! I love it! What a beautiful pattern! I exclaimed, holding it up against my shirt.He beamed at me. See? I know you, I know what you like! he almost shouted.Im touched. Thank you, I told him. He was still grinning. He had just retired as a tailor, and this was his business  knowing mens styles, and making them feel comfortable in their clothes. He had done well and it gave him pleasure, I suspect, to be able to help me.Perhaps Im in the minority of men, but I appreciate being given ties.My kids get me ties for Fathers Day, clichd as that may be. Their taste tends toward bright colors and animals, and I dutifully wear them to work, proudly displaying them to colleagues and patients alike, despite my wifes entreaties to keep an extra, more subdued tie at the office that I could change into.My dad, on the other hand, hated ties. He even declared, on the few occasions I ever actually saw him wear one, that he hoped the man who invented these objects of asphyxiation suffered mightily during his own lifetime.Yet, when my dad died, it was his ties I turned to. After his funeral, I sat on the floor of his closet and sorted through his collection, some decades old, of varied patterns and widths, some still bearing the stains from hurried pasta dinners or cups of coffee. And during the weeks that followed, when I felt as if I roamed the earth unmoored in his absence, I wore his ties to give me strength, and bring me peace.I still do.My patients often comment on my ties. I have one, I think intended for a lawyer, subtly patterned with tiny wolves in sheeps clothing. When a patient notices the gag, I joke that its probably not what they were hoping for in an oncologist, and they laugh, breaking the tension in the room.Ties can be conversation starters, allowing me and my patients to talk about mundanities, before we launch into the seriousness of cancer. Most patients compliment me on my ties. A few of my patients, all older and more formal in how they approach their doctors appointments, come dressed to the nines to my clinic, and I make sure to compliment them, too, as they clearly value appearances. But occasionally, someone will make a comment that is vituperative. One patient blurted, as soon as I walked into the clinic room:Whoa, doc, that tie is awful! Did you get dressed this morning with the lights off in your bedroom?I didnt get upset. Im not exactly considered a fashion maven, and style is subjective. I also knew, as did he, that his leukemia had returned, and suspected he was taking out his anger about the return of his cancer on the fabric of my tie.Ties in medicine can be controversial. There is even a growing movement to ban ties, as they may be vehicles for transmission of germs in their casual draping across hospital beds and exam tables as we move from one patient to the next. Many pediatricians eschew ties for this reason  as well as to prevent themselves from choking, as infants and toddlers are prone to grab them during a clinic visit. This is less likely to occur with adult patients, although it did to me recently.I was examining a woman in her 30s with leukemia who had suffered mightily at the hands of our chemotherapy, but had emerged in a remission and was feeling better. As I stood before her and reached to feel for lymph nodes in her neck, she similarly reached up to straighten my tie and tighten the knot. Our eyes met, and we both laughed, embarrassed.Im sorry, she said. Your tie was off to the side. I need you looking right for me.Many patients have expectations of how professional their doctors should appear. If a tie helps build confidence as they face the uncertainty of cancer treatment, as wearing my dads ties helped me build confidence as I faced life without a father, then Im happy to wear one.Dr. Mikkael Sekeres is director of the leukemia program at the Cleveland Clinic.

(I need to send him to a fat farm, she said. I was thinking about The Ashram, but Im not sure he can handle it.) Shes looking for a monthlong philosophy course for him in London.Shes not my wife, but I dont have a wife anymore and I need someone to take care of me, said Mr. Barcel, who is paying Ms. Cox $350 an hour.Ms. Cox is hired by men and women who need help navigating the turbulence of leaving one life behind and building a new one. My job is to fill the void for what they dont have, she said. Im a temporary fixer. They really need someone when they suddenly have no one.As technology works to ease so many of lifes quandaries, divorce remains one of the most logistically complicated and emotionally wrought events. But a small marketplace of fixers (mostly, so far, middlewomen) are starting businesses meant to simplify the ancillary processes associated with a marital break-up.Liza Feiler started a company called Divorce Concierge Group in the Washington area after her own marriage ended in 2012. I was lost after my divorce, unsure where to begin, said Ms. Feiler, 44. She is hired, post-divorce, for a starting flat fee of $350, most often by ex-wives. She helps clients with tasks like putting their homes on the market and hiring accountants.You come to me and say, I need new health insurance, and I will come back to you with two plans to choose and a start date, she said.Digital entrepreneurs are also marrying in. Divorceify, a web platform created by three lawyers, pairs members to services that fit their individualized needs: therapists, mediators, parenting coordinators and financial consultants. Divorce is not a one-size-fits-all process, and you need a holistic approach, said Sonia Queralt, 34 and a divorced divorce lawyer and coach in Miami, who is one of the founders.Ms. Coxs service is also personalized and touches on different facets of her clients lives. Her clientele is well-to-do, often international, with multiple homes: the sort of people who frequent Gstaad and Greece if not SoulCycle and Sagaponack.The services Ms. Cox provides tends to fall into stereotypical silos. For men, she helps them get set up to manage their own homes and to prepare for parenting challenges.For women, Ms. Cox works to get them on a budget, to make sure they have insurance and wealth managers and to give them tough-love lectures about the importance of getting a job. She helps them sell country homes for some extra cash. (For real estate transactions, she gets a cut from the broker.)For men and women, she offers herself as a sounding board and friend. She arranges visits to spas and nutritionists for weight loss and to psychiatrists to treat depression.The need for Ms. Coxs services is perhaps best explained by the man who helped introduce her to this potential market, her own ex-husband, Kevin Cox, 53. (They were divorced in 2000 after seven years of marriage and have amicably raised their son, Kevin Jr., 18.)When you look at a couple, there are, generally speaking, two people with very distinct responsibilities, said Mr. Cox, an investment banker. Suddenly one side is thrust into taking care of what the other side has always taken care of. I have seen men whose careers fly off the rails amid a divorce.It was thanks to her own marital breakup that Ms. Cox met the man who has become her closest professional partner, the prominent divorce lawyer Bernard Clair. They regularly refer business to each other.Shes tied into a dirty little secret and that is that even moneyed spouses, the so-called masters of the universe, need a lot of help before, during and after the divorce process, said Mr. Clair, 65. A guy has had everything done by the homemaking spouse and is suddenly living alone, and he doesnt know what the hell to do.Exhibit A, a client shared by Ms. Cox and Mr. Clair: a father of two young children who is a wealthy financier who travels frequently for work. His wife had wanted the divorce, and the combination of her leaving him and him finding himself living alone for the first time in more than a dozen years left the client, Mr. Clair said, emotionally bereft.While Mr. Clair hammered out the legal settlement, Ms. Cox got him settled.Mr. Clair said she connected him with an agency for nannies and he hired help. She also introduced him to other divorced parents with children of similar ages to his. (He was overwhelmed with the responsibilities of filling all the free time with the children, Mr. Clair said.)Ms. Cox created a FreshDirect account for the man and put together a list of foods for regular delivery. She taught him how to use Grubhub. She found him a psychiatrist and a girlfriend.I work a lot with people on issues that can help ease the transition for kids, Ms. Cox said. I encourage men to get an apartment thats in walking distance to the moms and to make the new home feel very familiar for the kids.Ms. Coxs friends and clients say she is suited to this specialized high-end niche, in part because she had worked at a wealth management and investment firm, and as an event planner who traveled abroad extensively, givng her connections all over the world.She is also nurturing. When Ms. Cox takes on a client, she offers a full-service operation.What she is doing with divorce is very smart, said Ana Luiza Rego, 57, as she sipped coffee at her Manhattan pied--terre. If you leave men alone, they die. Have you ever seen a man at the supermarket? They have a cart filled with peanuts.Ms. Rego is an old friend and current client: She is long ago divorced (twice, from the same man), but she is just now trying to rebuild her career as a painter and make a new life. A resident of Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Rego wants to move to New York with her daughter Filippa Paulson. Its Ms. Coxs job to facilitate that.I want two very different things, Ms. Rego said. I want to catch up with my career and to make my daughter successful. I dont have anyone else to help me, and it can be very lonely sometimes  $350 an hour is worth it.Ms. Paulson, 21, spent about six weeks in New York earlier this year to study with her Cox-procured American tutors and to experience local culture. She got me a great table at Catch downtown, Ms. Paulson said. She gets me into 1 Oak.Middle-of-the-night demands are part of the gig. I sleep with my phone on the pillow, Ms. Cox said. Kids of clients are always texting me asking, Can you get me in? Then I go back to sleep. If I cant do the little things, then I lose my credibility and then no one calls, at any hour."}
{"text": "I was 19 the first time I held an assault rifle. It was on a concrete court inside a National Guard armory in Bloomington, Ind., where Id gathered with fellow R.O.T.C. cadets for weapons training. A sergeant opened an olive-drab arms case and handed out M-16A2s. We each took one apart and reassembled it, learning the sequence, learning how to safely clear it, learning to check its functions. It has been years since I held one, but regardless of the model  an M-16, an M-4 or a civilian variant like the AR-15 or Sig Sauer MCX  Im confident I could disassemble it blindfolded.That sounds more impressive than it is. In truth, its simple. Ensure the selector lever is on safe. Drop the magazine. Clear the chamber. Find the takedown pin. Lift the upper receiver. The rest is just a series of pushes or pulls on particular parts: the charging handle, the buffer spring, the bolt carrier group, the retainer pin. My brain might forget the names of the pieces, but my hands remember. Even if I just pantomime the act of holding that rifle, my hands know where to rest: index finger over the trigger well  never inside it  thumb on the selector lever, ready to switch and fire.The massacre in Orlando this week, in which the shooter used a Sig Sauer MCX, has renewed arguments for banning assault weapons, but even talking about these guns in America can become a game of semantics. People obsess over terminology like literary scholars. Ive taught college English for almost two years now, and for all the fulminating against the culture of political correctness, Ive never seen language scrutinized like the language of armaments and gun control. There is a mechanical difference between the M-4 I carried in Afghanistan and a civilian assault rifle, but given the way we trained and shot (using semiautomatic mode), there is almost no distinction. When I look at a photo of myself in Afghanistan  on a combat mission in July 2009  I find myself examining the gun. I could buy that rifle online, including all the accessories, with minimal difficulty. I cant go back to Afghanistan, at least not now. I cant be 25 again. I cant recapture the fear or the wonderment or the grief  for a recently deceased friend  that I felt in that instant. But the weapon I carried could be mine again, with only slight variations. I could once again own a little part of that regrettable era.But I dont want an assault rifle. I dont want to be back in Afghanistan either. Ive shot thousands of rounds, and Ive seen the effects of the bullets impact, and I want nothing of it. A friend of mine, himself an Army Special Forces officer with numerous combat deployments, agonized over the massacre in Orlando: People who say they need an AR for hunting or home defense often dont understand the weapons ballistics or overpenetration, he said. ARs cause horrific damage to humans; thats why the military developed them. He continued: If you want to shoot an AR so bad, please feel free to join the fight against ISIS in the military.Another friend, a young soldier I once supervised, told me that he prefers AR-15s for home defense  and he has worked as a civilian firearms instructor. With the small size of the bullet, the high velocity and low recoil, its easier to be accountable for each shot you fire than with something like a pistol or shotgun, he said. Ive seen a corpse with its organs knocked out from the impact of 5.56-millimeter rounds from an M-4. But my former soldier has a point, too: when the bullet hits paper, youd think someone had poked a hole with a pencil.When my unit returned from Afghanistan, I rented a house in Anchorage. It was the first time Id slept alone since leaving America. I woke up in sheer terror. I wanted my M-4. I was unarmed, and I could hear pedestrian traffic. They could just walk into my house and shoot me if they wanted.A few days later, I forgot to check my blind spot while driving, and I nearly struck a pickup truck. The driver ran out of his vehicle to scream at me. I reached for my ghost appendage, for the M-4 that I would have held between my legs had I still been on a convoy mission, still inside a Humvee. I felt naked without it. He could have just shot me.This fear may seem irrational. It wasnt at the time. I carried an M-4 because I was an infantryman in a combat zone fighting a brutal and fruitless war of occupation, and I had to be ready to fire rounds into human targets in an instant, lest they shoot me first. These weapons are intended for the battlefield. I dont want an assault rifle, because I dont want to think of my home country as a battlefield. I dont want civilians to own assault rifles, because I think the risks outweigh the rewards. If people really do believe that they need them, maybe its because they see a battlefield where others dont.A few days after the traffic incident in Anchorage, while jogging amid melting March slush on a park trail, I found myself startled  a teenage kid was running close behind me, a kid clad in all black, just playing around. In the instant before recognition, before I processed that this was an adolescent without a weapon, before I identified him as safe, I raised my arms as though moving my rifle to the high ready position. I slid my thumb across the screen of my music player as though it were the selector lever moving from safe to semi, ready to put rounds downrange. Because my hands remembered.I dont want to believe that we live in a place so dangerous as to require these weapons. Maybe Im nave. Maybe Im just waiting to be victimized. Id rather be nave and hopeful than face the alternative: the howling terror, the sensation that danger is kept at bay only by that familiar weight, those familiar clicks, and what comes after."}
{"text": "CHARLESTON, S.C.  A year ago, the nation was transfixed by a different horrific crime, the shooting deaths of nine church members during Bible study at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church here. With the backdrop of the Orlando shootings, survivors and family members of the victims of the Charleston slayings on June 17, 2015, sat down to reflect on forgiveness, race relations, gun violence and the suspect, Dylann S. Roof, called Prime Evil by some of the survivors. On Friday, they joined parishioners from Emanuel A.M.E. Church, political leaders and congregations from around the region for a memorial service at the TD Arena in Charleston, where a year earlier President Obama delivered a eulogy that culminated with his singing Amazing Grace.The conversation, led by Michael Schwirtz and Chris Dixon of The New York Times, included:Felicia and Tyrone Sanders, the parents of Tywanza Sanders, 26, who was killed. Felicia Sanders was present at the shooting, shielding her 11-year-old granddaughter from the assailant.Polly Sheppard, a retired nurse who survived the attack.The children of Ethel Lance, who was killed. They are the Rev. Sharon Risher, Esther Lance, Nadine Collier and Gary WashingtonDaniel Simmons Jr., the son of the Rev. Daniel L. Simmons, who was killed.Michael Schwirtz: Nadine, you gained some fame and notoriety when you stood up in court during the bond hearing and publicly forgave Dylann Roof. Do you have any regrets about that statement?Nadine Collier: I stand behind it. All the way. I dont have no regrets at all. I just believe in God. And didnt have that hatred in my heart.Esther Lance: I dont forgive him because my heart aint there. It aint going to be no time soon. I cant forgive him.The Rev. Sharon Risher: Forgiveness is a personal journey for everybody. I have not gotten to that point where I could forgive Dylann Roof. Thats just me. Being in clergy, Im mandated to forgive, yet I understand that God is a loving god and that he gives everybody an opportunity to reach that path of forgiveness.Felicia Sanders: Forgiveness is not for the person. The person doesnt care whether you forgive him or not. Forgiveness is for you. Forgiveness is growth. If you dont have any forgiveness in you, it makes you stagnate. You will never grow. Youre giving the individual the power over you, so that means youre still a victim to the person. I want to say that we refuse to be a victim. I want him to know, Prime Evil to know, that just because you took our loved ones, you dont have us. I believe we can get more done now than before.Tyrone Sanders: I want to put on the record that Im not there yet. I dont know if Ill ever forgive.Mr. Schwirtz: Is there any wisdom or insight you have gained over the last year and what challenges are you still trying to overcome?Daniel Simmons: Over the past year, there are a lot of things that transpired positive and negative for all of us. One of the things that happens out of tragedy  as people we have a choice of whether were going to be active or how were going to respond. So one of the great things, and Im so proud of my daughter, is that we began a nonprofit, the Hate Wont Win movement. Its a nonprofit thats going to provide opportunity, services programs, initiatives about hate-related crimes, violent crimes, gun control and empowerment initiatives.Everybody is doing something, whether its going back to school with their children, providing scholarships, whether its changing their lifestyles to have an opportunity to give back, to speak in different places, to travel to talk about their personal experiences, to sit down and do an interview with The New York Times. God chose the right place, the right families and the right individuals and most importantly the time. God does what he hates to accomplish what he loves.Mr. Schwirtz: Reverend Risher, what has it been like to be directly involved with the gun issue, pressing for legislation. Have you felt any frustration?Ms. Risher: Right after June 17, I became very vocal and involved in grass-roots advocacy groups on gun control. So Ive been on Capitol Hill, I testified before the judiciary committee in Oregon. I have lent my voice to different bills. This is what that year has brought for me, an opportunity and a platform to beg our American people to look at the gun laws, look at background checks.Its long hard frustrating work, the results arent something tangible that you can put your hands on, but laws are being changed and the attention to gun reform is out there. Im always optimistic.Mr. Schwirtz: The shooting prompted fierce debate over the issue of race in South Carolina and culminated with the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds. How has the issue evolved over the last year?Ms. Risher: The racial tension and history of Charleston is there. It took hundreds of years to build it; it will probably take hundreds of years for people to look at Charleston, South Carolina, as a different place.Mr. Sanders: I had a Confederate flag, like about 10 doors down from me. I was tempted to go on the porch and ask them to take it down. But I said, No Im going to go ahead and leave them alone just like Ms. Polly says. If you leave them alone theyll eventually settle down. And they took it down. Theyve got the state flag up now.Chris Dixon: Did you expect the Confederate battle flag at the State House to come down?Mr. Sanders: I was in awe because I didnt expect it to happen. But that flag coming down wont bring my son back. Or my aunt or the other seven.Mr. Dixon: How has the shooting changed Charleston and the way people relate or interact with each other?Mr. Sanders: If they know who I am, theyre a little kinder. When I went back to work, it seemed I got a lot of embracing from the white guys.Ms. Sanders: I still think that there is a lot of unity. Ive met so many people within this year that I would have never met. So many people still coming giving their condolences. Thats unity right there. I see a lot more smiles.Ms.  Sheppard: The same. People are a little kinder to each other.Ms.  Sanders: June 17, 2015, was the first racism Ive ever encountered. And I got it all at once.Ms. Sheppard: Theres unity in more ways than one. If you look on Sunday youll see about seven or eight of those trucks with those Confederate flags going across the bridge. So theyre unifying, too.Mr. Schwirtz: Can you speak about your relationship with Emanuel? Are any of you still active in the church?Ms. Sanders: Ive been trying to go. Its not easy. Its a preparation for me. When I go there, I have to not eat at night or drink anything in the morning so that I wont have to go downstairs to the bathroom.Emanuel is not Emanuel no more. Emanuel is the new Emanuel. The church for some reason thinks its about the church. The fellowship hall, where it all happened at, they didnt give it no respect. I was in line to go into my sons funeral. And I heard somebody say, Oh, you should go downstairs now, it smells like blood. How do you think that made me feel?Ms. Sheppard: This happened on Wednesday and they were back in church on Sunday, which I thought was terrible.Ms. Simmons: I dont feel the church should have been opened that soon. Because when I went to the church a couple of days after, I could still sense and smell blood. So it wasnt a good feeling for me. It was one of my weakest moments Ive experienced throughout this whole process.Ms. Collier: The last time I was there was Aug. 30, 2015, my mothers birthday. And I havent been back since.Growing up I was on choir at the church. Since this happened, its like, everything, my whole life changed. My mom was assassinated for the church.My momma when she was not ushering, we got a little seat we sit at, two three rows from the back. Id come around and sit on the side of her. Can you imagine me coming in and sitting in the front? It just freaks me out. Took everything out of my body just to do that on her birthday. I havent been back."}

{"text": "DENVER  A couple of innings after D. J. LeMahieu lay prone after taking a fastball to the helmet, he stepped into the batters box for what should have been a very gingerly at-bat against Aroldis Chapman and the major leagues fastest fastball.Instead, LeMahieu dismissed the beaning as a once-in-a-career moment, dug in and drove Chapmans two-strike fastball deep into the right-center-field gap, racing around the bases with a run-scoring triple.LeMahieus eighth-inning hit put the finishing touches on the Colorado Rockies 6-3 victory over the Yankees on Wednesday on a hot, arid afternoon.It also represented the type of up-off-the-mat resilience that the Yankees are going to need to show soon if they are going to be a factor in the playoff race.The Yankees have followed a five-game winning streak with four consecutive losses, sinking back into last place in the American League East.You win five games in a row, you lose one, then try to put three or four more in a row, Manager Joe Girardi said. We havent been able to do that, and thats why were where were at.He added: This is an important month. We cant keep having months where were not making up ground, cause if youre losing ground, its going to be tough to catch up. These are months where we have to play better than the teams that are in front of us.The Yankees tried to do so on Wednesday with a lineup that was without its biggest bats. Alex Rodriguez was relegated to the bench because there is no designated hitter in National League parks, Brian McCann was given the day off after catching Tuesday nights game, and Carlos Beltran missed a second consecutive game after having his left knee drained and receiving a cortisone shot.Chase Headley hit cleanup, and Didi Gregorius followed him in the order.The Yankees, not surprisingly, did not manage an extra-base hit, but they did take a 2-1 lead in the fourth when Starlin Castro singled in Jacoby Ellsbury and scored when catcher Tony Wolters threw away Aaron Hickss dribbler in front of the plate.The lead evaporated in the fifth when LeMahieu, who had earlier doubled and scored, singled up the middle to score Charlie Blackmon. LeMahieu came home on Nolan Arenados home run to left. The Rockies added another run against Ivan Nova, the Yankees starter, when Trevor Story doubled and scored on Mark Reynoldss two-out single to give the Rockies a 5-2 lead.The game then nearly took a nasty turn in the sixth, when reliever Anthony Swarzaks fastball caught LeMahieu in the helmet. LeMahieu lay face down for a moment before slowly rising to his feet and heading to first base.I dont know where it hit me, LeMahieu said. I was pretty lucky it wasnt worse. I was just more shocked than anything. I figured all right, everythings good.Somewhat predictably, Rockies reliever Miguel Castro buzzed the first Yankees hitter in the top of the seventh, Austin Romine, with a pair of 99-mile-per-hour fastballs. The second one sailed to the backstop and drew a warning to both teams from Gabe Morales, the home plate umpire.I thought it was warranted, Girardi said. Only he knows, but it looked awful suspicious to me. If youre trying to send a message, I get that, but it cant be around someones head.Said LeMahieu: I dont think there was any message sent there other than a couple of balls got away from him. But it looks bad after that inning.When Dellin Betances threw a curveball at Rockies first baseman Mark Reynoldss head in the next inning, Morales did not eject him.Whenever it goes by somebodys head when we saw somebody get hit in the head, it always kind of freaks you out, like, Oh, whats going on here? Arenado said. But it was off-speed, and it got away from him. It happens.Girardi said he would not have reacted mildly if Betances had been ejected.If the ump says something, Im going to go ballistic, Girardi said.Me, too, Betances said when told of his managers comment.It remains to be seen whether the Yankees can carry that type of fire to Minnesota, where they begin a four-game series on Thursday with the Twins, the team with the worst record in the American League. But little else seemed capable of stirring the Yankees, a team urgently in need of it.INSIDE PITCHMARK TEIXEIRA said he expected to go on a rehabilitation assignment next Tuesday and Wednesday with a targeted return from the disabled list of June 24 at home against the Twins. Teixeira said he was pleased with how the torn cartilage in his left knee had responded to shots and rest. But if the discomfort returns, he could have season-ending surgery."}
{"text": "Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Eugene Monroe was released Wednesday, several months after he had publicly called on the N.F.L. to let players use medical marijuana to treat injuries.Though retired N.F.L. players have advocated for the use of medical marijuana, Monroe is one of the few active players who have taken that stance. Medical marijuana, he said, is safer and healthier than prescription painkillers, which can be addictive.Monroe, who is now a free agent, said he would continue to call on the league to loosen its stance, regardless of whether he continues to play in the N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell has said only that the leagues advisers continue to evaluate the issue.In a statement, Monroe acknowledged that he had been hampered by injuries. Adam Schefter of ESPN also reported that the Ravens had tried to trade Monroe to the Giants but that the talks had fallen through.Still, Monroe questioned whether his advocacy might have also played a role in his release.I cant say for sure whether or not my stance on medical cannabis was the reason the Ravens released me, Monroe said. However, as Ive said in the past, they have distanced themselves from me and made it clear that they do not support my advocacy.A team spokesman said Monroe had been released but declined to say whether his stance on medical marijuana had been part of the reason."}
{"text": "After Orlando and San Bernardino and Paris, there is new urgency to understand the signs that can precede acts of terrorism. And with the Islamic States prolific use of social media, terrorism experts and government agencies continually search for clues in posts and Twitter messages that appear to promote the militants cause.A physicist may not seem like an obvious person to study such activity. But for months, Neil Johnson, a physicist at the University of Miami, led a team that created a mathematical model to sift order from the chaotic pro-terrorism online universe.In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Johnson and Miami colleagues searched for pro-Islamic State posts each day from mid-2014 until August 2015, mining mentions of beheadings and blood baths in multiple languages on Vkontakte, a Russia-based social media service that is the largest European equivalent to Facebook. Ultimately, they devised an equation that tries to explain the activity of Islamic State sympathizers online and might, they say, eventually help predict attacks that are about to happen.Experts who study terrorism and online communication said that the new research was informative, and that they appreciated that the authors would make their data available to other researchers. But they cautioned that the actions of terrorist groups are extremely difficult to anticipate and said more information was needed, especially to substantiate any predictive potential of the teams equation.This is an interesting approach, this is a potentially valuable approach, and more research should be done on the approach, said J. M. Berger, a fellow in George Washington Universitys Program on Extremism and the co-author of ISIS: The State of Terror. But to jump ahead to the utility of it, I think, takes more work.Dr. Johnson, who also heads the Complexity Initiative, an interdisciplinary research program at the University of Miami, said the studys goal was to start a proper quantitative science of online extremism to replace the black-box narrative that is currently used.Instead of focusing only on large social media groups or trying to track millions of individual users, the researchers suggest focusing on small, nimble groups because they reflect groundswells of new activity and, if followed, can potentially point to where that activity is going. While such tracking in itself might not prevent individual acts, like the massacres in Orlando or San Bernardino, it can help identify when conditions are ripe for such acts to happen, the study said.The tracking of terrorists on social media should take a cue from nature, Dr. Johnson said, where the way transitions happen is like a flock of birds, a school of fish.Theres no one fish saying, Hey, I want everyone to be about five inches away from someone else, and were going to have this shape,  he said.The researchers  including experts in international covert networks who spoke Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish  analyzed activity on Vkontakte because Facebook shuts down pro-Islamic State discussions very quickly, Dr. Johnson said, and because Vkontaktes 350 million users are diverse, including many Chechen members who have been targets of Islamic State propaganda. For comparison, the researchers tracked groups promoting civil unrest in Latin America, including strikes and protests, and found both similarities and differences to online activity supporting the Islamic State.The study focused on small groups of Islamic State supporters that formed online and found about 200 such groups, with more than 100,000 members combined. The groups postings included pledges of allegiance to the extremists, fund-raising appeals and survival tips, like how to protect oneself during drone attacks. The pull of small groups is strong. So-called lone wolf sympathizers do not remain alone long, the study said: They usually join a small group within weeks.Quashing these groups, the study found, can prevent their members from fusing with larger pro-Islamic State groups, which can quickly distribute inciting videos or statements to much broader audiences. But when small groups are blocked by Vkontakte, about a quarter of them reinvent themselves  changing their names, reincarnating, or briefly going dark before re-emerging, the researchers found.The researchers also said there might be a spike in the formation of small online groups just before an attack takes place. This is based on the one major unexpected attack by the Islamic State that occurred during the months the researchers studied: the attack on Kobani, a Syrian town on the Turkish border, which came under siege in September 2014.Just before the Kobani incursion, the rate of creation of pro-Islamic State online groups accelerated, Dr. Johnson said. After all the data on small groups was plugged into the teams equation, the Kobani attack was the only one the formula would have predicted, showing that the equation matched real-world occurrences during the period studied, he said.Faiza Patel, a director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice, said the study showed that there are ways to look at narrow groups rather than the entire population of internet users.But because the Kobani attack was the only example cited, she said, Frankly, at this point, I dont think theyre predicting anything.There may be five other independent reasons for the spike in this pro-ISIS propaganda, she noted, and I dont know they have taken into account the other possible explanations.Mr. Berger said Kobani, aside from being the sole example cited, was a military-style operation, not a terrorist attack, so the formula, should it hold up, might only apply to large-scale sieges.With military action, if their strategy is to use social media to intimidate, then it makes sense that there would be a spike in online groups forming just before, he said. But with a terrorist attack, were often talking about one, two, sometimes a dozen people who are operating out of conditions of secrecy.Attacks like the one in Orlando are still rare, Ms. Patel said, with so many different variables that its very, very difficult to come up with any predictive formula.Both Mr. Berger and Ms. Patel noted a tricky question raised by the research: When is it best to try to suppress small groups so they do not mushroom into bigger groups, and when should they be left to percolate? Letting them exist for a while might be a way to gather intelligence, Ms. Patel said.Dr. Johnson said that was one of many questions for further research. If I break the groups up too quickly, he said, I have the risk that Im liberating out these individuals, scattering them like a virus to infect other groups.Other questions involve how fast information travels among small groups, and the role of women  who, the researchers reported in a previous study, accounted for about 40 percent of group members and were likely to communicate about twice as many pieces of information through the social network as men were.Mr. Berger praised the researchers transparency.There are a lot of companies that claim to be able to do what this study is claiming, and a lot of those companies seem to me to be selling snake oil, he said. If the predictive theory holds up, he added, it would be the silver bullet everybody in the government and everybody in the private sector has been chasing for years."}

{"text": "Nani Ma was standing in a white sari outside her hut, a bare concrete block with a tin roof, when I arrived. The villagers who told me about her had described her accurately  a slender British woman in her late 60s who radiated calm. For 16 years she had meditated alone in a cave in the Indian Himalayas. Recently she had broken her vow of silence and moved to this hut in Uttarkashi, in the foothills of the mountains. I had hiked four kilometers through a dense forest to meet her.Six months earlier, in late 2012, I had left my job in New York to learn meditation, first in a Sivananda ashram in southern India, then in a forest ashram in the Uttarkashi district. I grew up in Shimla, also in the Himalayas, and always thought I would return one day to live a silent, contemplative life. My mothers death from cancer fast-forwarded the plan 20 years. I wanted a more urgent answer to my questions about the nature of life, suffering and death. But despite practicing six hours of yoga and meditation every day for months, I hadnt glimpsed the transcendence I read about in the Buddhist and yogic scriptures. Now I had a rare chance to ask a saint what more I could do.Nani Mas kind face was marked with bright splotches of red, and she was mostly bald. For a period of years she had subsisted on two bottles of cows milk that the villagers left for her every day. Perhaps living on a milk-only diet irritates your skin and makes you lose your hair. Her good temper was intact, though. She greeted my intrusion with a warm smile, as if she had been expecting me. I bowed and touched her feet. She went inside her hut and got me water in an earthen pot. I was sweating after hiking down steep trails for a few hours and took it gladly. We sat down on a rock in front of her hut next to the Ganges River. Across the river, the mountains rose high above the mist, a colossal tower of green speckled with snow.Unlike the grim, bearded yogis I knew from my childhood, she was open and welcoming. But words failed me. They seemed too limited and impersonal to articulate the questions in my mind: What have you learned about the nature of reality while living in complete silence? Your face looks so serene  are you enlightened? What does enlightenment feel like and how does one achieve it?She filled the silence by asking me questions about myself in a gentle, smiling voice. I told her I left India to pursue a corporate career in the United States a decade ago. Now I was back for spiritual reasons, but in the six months I spent meditating in these ashrams, all I thought about was petty material concerns, like whether I would have a job when I returned to New York and whether my fiance and I should have a traditional Indian wedding. I was tired of my trivial thoughts and was thinking of taking more drastic measures like living in a cave alone for a month.In the middle of my rant, a mechanical whirring sound came from the hut.Nani Ma excused herself. She returned a few minutes later with a sheet of paper and a cellphone in her hand.I have to make a phone call, she said.I stared at her. Of course, I said. Ill leave.Im on the board of a hospice now, she said. We have a meeting, and Ive received two prayers for review.I stood up from the rock, wondering vaguely how she managed to get a cellphone connection so soon after spending 16 years in a cave. It took me three weeks of submitting and resubmitting documentation about my identity and residency, as well as references, before finally being granted a connection.Thank you for your time, I said. Can I support the hospice in any way?Nani Mas face brightened.Oh, yes, she said with a broad, toothless smile. Come inside for a minute.I followed her inside her hut, stooping to enter through the small wooden door. On one side of the 6-by-10-foot room was a mattress with a brown blanket and five or six articles of clothing in a neatly folded pile. Opposite the bed were a saucepan, one clay glass, a bag of rice and a printer.Nani Ma bent down and got a packet of greeting cards from under the printer. She showed them to me with delight.The children in the village designed them, she said. The cards had a picture of a long-stemmed marigold flower on them with Ganga Prem Hospice written under it.We sell these to raise funds, she said. Do you want to buy one? The packets were 50 rupees (about 75 cents) each.Nani Ma had returned to the world. It occurred to me that maybe it was time for me to do the same. I bought 30 cards and went on my way."}
{"text": "On Monday night, a French police officer and his wife were stabbed to death at their home outside Paris by Larossi Abballa, a Frenchman acting in the name of the Islamic State. The attack came barely two days after an American, Omar Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, killed 49 people at a gay bar in Orlando, Fla.The attacks were further evidence of the Islamic States power to inspire terrorists in Europe and the United States to act on their own. French security forces are acutely aware of this danger, but they are overwhelmed by the scale of the terrorist threat in France exposed by last years deadly shootings in Paris, and say they simply cannot keep close track of the some 2,000 French citizens who concern them. The state of emergency declared by President Franois Hollande after those attacks remains in effect.The French police are also stretched to the limit. A labor reform bill introduced by Mr. Hollandes government in March has spawned crippling strikes and a series of street protests that have degenerated into violent clashes between demonstrators and police officers. In Paris on Tuesday, in the ugliest protest yet, anarchists smashed windows and hurled projectiles at the police, with officers in full riot gear responding with tear gas and water cannons. Scores of people were injured.On top of everything else, France is the host of the Euro 2016 soccer tournament, which has been marred by clashes between Russian and British soccer fans that caused multiple injuries and led to more than 300 arrests.The Hollande governments inability to maintain public order has been widely criticized, and rightly so. Hooliganism at international soccer matches is not new: France should have been better prepared. Meanwhile, the French police need to rethink crowd control with a goal of ratcheting down violent confrontation.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls threatened to deny the radical C.G.T. labor union leading the street protests permission to hold more rallies if it cannot rein in troublemakers. People have a clear right to engage in peaceful protest, but the violence is out of control and the terrorist threat remains high. Mr. Valls should invoke the state of emergency to ban demonstrations until after the soccer tournament ends on July 10."}
{"text": "SOFIA, Bulgaria  IN the final days of June 1914, a telegram arrives in a remote garrison town on the border of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On it is a single sentence in capital letters: Heir to the throne rumored assassinated in Sarajevo.In a moment of disbelief and anxiety, one of the officers begins speaking Hungarian to his compatriots. The others cant understand a word, but they suspect that the Hungarian is probably not unhappy with the news that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whom Hungarians see as partial to the empires Slavs, cannot now become the next emperor.Another officer, a Slovene, who has long questioned the loyalty of Hungarians, insists that the conversation be in their common language, German. I will say it in German, replies the Hungarian officer. We are in agreement, my countrymen and I: We can be glad the bastard is gone.The scene was fictional  depicted in Joseph Roths remarkable novel The Radetzky March  but it captures a pivotal moment in European history: the end of the Hapsburg Empire. What Roths scene suggests is that the end of the empire was the outcome of decades of political decay, but also a moment of paralyzing uncertainty in the wake of disruptive events. The disintegration that until that moment was unimaginable suddenly seemed inevitable.Pitched a century forward, Roths story is a powerful explanation of why the Brexit referendum is not about the future of Britain alone, but about the future of the European project. What seemed impossible even a year ago now seems fated. The European Union will probably be better run with Britain out, but it is unlikely to survive if the British next week decide to leave.The Radetzky March is particularly apt here because, though the focus after a Leave victory will be on Britain, the real disaster will befall Roths literary stamping grounds of Central and Eastern Europe. Indeed, in a very real way, the disintegration of Europe will be set off by Brexit, but it will take place far to the east.And it will happen here because of the same sort of complex allegiances that Roth depicted. Central and Eastern Europe live a paradox: According to the recent opinion polls, we East Europeans are the ones most friendly to the union, but also the most likely to vote for Brussels-bashing governments. Eastern Europeans want the union to survive because they are among the major beneficiaries of European integration. They would be the biggest losers in economic, political and security terms if integration was reversed.At the same time Eastern Europeans, who less than three decades ago weathered the collapse of another political project, Soviet Communism, dont quite trust such border-spanning efforts, and they want to be prepared in case things go awry. They vote for nationalists not because they want them to destroy the European Union but, per Pascals wager, because they want to be ready in case the union commits collective suicide.Theres a form of social psychology at work here. After seven decades of stability, Western Europeans tend to believe in the resilience of institutions. Eastern Europeans dont share that confidence. In a sense the European Union is like a married couple (Western Europe and Eastern Europe) who go through a nasty spell whenever some of the family money is lost in the stock market. The memories of their great romantic past have faded and most of their friends (read: the United States) are preoccupied with their own problems. If the family therapist wants to help the couple preserve their marriage, she has to be aware that one of the partners (Eastern Europe) previously endured an awful divorce. And the feeling that what happens today is simply a repetition of what happened before will, to a great extent, define that partners expectations.I was a philosophy student in my final year at Sofia University when the Bulgarian Communist regime collapsed. That sudden and nonviolent end of something that we were sure was forever  until overnight, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was not  is probably the defining experience of my generation. It brought not only a feeling of liberation but also the sense of the fragility of all things political.True, comparing the current crisis in the European Union with the Soviet and Yugoslav crises of the late 1980s can be a bit like comparing apples and oranges. By its final years, Communism and the regimes had long since lost their ideological appeal, and their capacity to deliver economic growth was exhausted. In 1990, only 11 percent of all consumer goods in the Soviet Union could be found easily in shops, while there was a shortage of the other 89 percent. In contrast, the European Union is the biggest single market in the world, and Europe accounts for half of the worlds welfare spending. Whereas a majority of Soviet citizens were attracted by life in the West, Europeans are proud of their way of life and political model, and hardly aspire to follow the trajectory of China or Russia.But ordinary people  unlike political scientists  are constantly comparing apples and oranges. They live in a world populated by dangerous analogies where every major crisis evokes memories of the previous one. And the experience of the Communist collapse strongly influences the way Eastern Europeans perceive and process Brexit. As Roth would understand immediately, the psychological impact of the British referendum is more important than any of the economic or institutional damages it can cost."}
{"text": "To the Editor:We at Emigrant Bank are disappointed at the lack of balance in Jim Dwyers June 8 About New York column regarding a lawsuit involving one of our loan programs.The program that Mr. Dwyer describes (which ended in 2008) was a small part of Emigrants operations  less than 5 percent of the banks total assets. It was a 100 percent legal loan program developed by Emigrant and intended for borrowers with low credit scores who otherwise would have been shut out of credit markets. The product was available to any borrower, regardless of race or other protected classes.More than 70 percent of borrowers in this program were thereby able to keep their homes. The plaintiffs own expert, in testimony before the court, described the loans as a lifeline for borrowers.The plaintiffs all had existing mortgages with other banks or other pending debts, and most were under the imminent threat of foreclosure if they didnt get an Emigrant loan. All borrowers signed a document clearly stating the payment amounts they undertook, and attested that they had the wherewithal to pay their mortgage. If borrowers had problems, Emigrant frequently modified loan terms and waived default interest to help them.Finally, four of the eight plaintiffs have been living for free in their homes for more than five years, while Emigrant has been forced to pay insurance and taxes on their properties.Mr. Dwyer accepted the plaintiffs allegations and attacked Emigrants chief executive, Howard Milstein, in personal terms. It is disappointing that he didnt provide a balanced look at loans that gave many New Yorkers a chance to save their homes.DOUGLAS J.

{"text": "In a rush to get home to the Bronx one afternoon in March and hoping to save a few dollars, Jose Lopez scanned the traffic near 116th Street for the livery cars that pick up riders and do not fuss with a meter. But no such luck.He gave up, stuck out a hand, and a green cab pulled over.A good thing he didnt find another taxi: By the time Mr. Lopez got out on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, he had effectively scored about $200,000 for himself and three friends.On Thursday, he and the three other men  all immigrants who worked construction in largely untamed territories of New York City  were handed checks of up to $50,000 by the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer.A decade ago, they were ripped off by a contractor who had hired them to work on renovations of rundown apartment houses owned by the city. The city recovered the money, but the hunt for many of the workers ran into one blind alley after another.Then Mr. Lopez got into that green cab on 116th Street.The cabdriver glanced once in the mirror, then turned to face him.Hey Jose, the driver, Mody Camara, said.As Mr. Camara and Mr. Lopez recalled the moment, Mr. Lopez seemed uncertain.You dont remember me? Mr. Camara said. You know me.Oh yeah, yeah, Mr. Lopez said. We worked together.For several years, they had done interior demolition of city-owned apartment buildings in Harlem. They were paid about $60 a day by a contractor, Mascon Restoration.We were looking for you guys, Mr. Camara said. Those people were cheating us.Mr. Camara said he had successfully made a claim with the city, getting more than $40,000. I bought a cab! he told Mr. Lopez.He insisted that if Mr. Lopez filed a claim, he, too, could get what was owed.And dont go by yourself  bring the other guys, Mr. Camara said. What about Gordito? You hear from Chiquito?Noted in passing: Mr. Camara, an immigrant from Mauritania whose native tongue is a variant of Arabic, plus some French, was calling his Honduran workmates by their Spanish nicknames. You never know the things that may be going on inside cabs rolling through the Bronx.By city law, Gordito and Chiquito and Mr. Lopez should have been paid salaries comparable to the prevailing wages that big builders pay on union jobs. Instead of the $60 a day they were getting from Mascon Restoration, for instance, the demolition workers should have been getting $45 an hour, according to the city comptrollers office.It turned out that virtually none of the construction workers were being paid the prevailing wages.During the administration of the former comptroller, John C. Liu, the city calculated that the workers had been cheated out of about $1.1 million by Mascon and the companies that oversaw its work. Mascon pleaded guilty in state court to a related felony and went out of business. The companies made restitution to the city, which held the money on behalf of the workers. But those workers, who were being paid off the books, had scattered to the winds.An investigator from the comptrollers office, Frank Gonzalez, went to the job sites from 2006 to 2009 before the workers were sent scurrying by their boss. They told us we would be fired if we took the fliers that Frank left us, Mr. Lopez said. They were also told, falsely, that Mr. Gonzalez was an immigration agent who was really there to deport them, said the workers and Mr. Gonzalez.So only a few workers filed for the money they had coming to them, despite efforts by Mr. Gonzalez and others to find them.Then Mr. Lopez got into the green cab driven by Mr. Camara.The connections began. Mr. Lopez contacted Reynaldo Castillo. In turn, Mr. Castillo (skip the nickname, please) got in touch with Elio Barrios (Chiquito) and Martin Diorisia. Mr. Gonzalez had taken pictures a decade ago, and was able to verify that they had, indeed, worked on the Mascon jobs.To much merriment, they picked up checks on Thursday. Mr. Diorisia, who now lives in North Carolina, had taken an overnight bus to New York and gone directly to the municipal building. The others live in the Bronx, most still doing construction.All of them marveled at the fortune that landed Mr. Lopez in Mr. Camaras cab.He didnt even charge me for the ride! Mr. Lopez said.In fact, the meter ran backward."}
{"text": "Blossom Bettles is 12 years old and lives on a tree-lined street in Brooklyn. Her father, who is British, is a photographer; her mother is a meditation and mindfulness teacher from New Zealand. She has a little brother named Sunny. Blossom is petite, with blue eyes and a dimpled smile, and wavy light-brown hair. Her name seems to suit her perfectly, until she straps on skates, dons her gear and becomes Dark Pixie, a fierce competitor in a gritty junior roller derby league in Bushwick.Gotham Girls Roller Derby, a womens organization with four competitive teams, serves as the sponsor for the junior league, which was created in 2012 for girls ages 8 to 17 to provide a positive, empowering space for girls to learn, practice and play a contact sport, said Tracey DeBenedictis, Gothams coaching director. The juniors do not compete for Gotham, but they skate in exhibition games, or bouts, at halftime in adult league competitions.In keeping with roller derby tradition, the rockabilly, Rosie-the-Riveter, riot grrrl aesthetic is in full effect throughout the Gotham organization, from the tattoos and piercings to the fishnets and tutus. And, of course, there are the irreverent skater names, like Smacklemore and Evilicious.But at the heart of the sport is a gracious and openhearted feminist ethos, wrapped in wrist guards by loving hands. And this is particularly evident in Gothams junior league.Without Gotham Girls Junior Derby, I have no doubt that I would not have finished high school, said Joanna Acevedo, also known as Mercy Killer, who is now 19. Roller derby has been a constant in my life, giving focus to what would otherwise be a very scary, uncertain time.Ms. Acevedo, now a college student, rose up through the junior ranks. She discovered roller derby in 2012 after attending a bout and decided to join on the spot, without ever having been on skates.Ms. Acevedo dedicates her weekends to helping the current juniors, who practice for three hours on Saturdays at Gothams crash pad, a 10,000-square-foot former storage space in Bushwick. In the center of the pad is an uneven oval, the flat track, made of sport court, a hard plastic, with regulation markings. A disco ball dangles above. Along the periphery are training stations and some bleachers. An office by the entrance is painted blood-red. Illustrations and images of powerful women cover the walls. The space smells of sweat-soaked gear and is filled with the cacophony of wheels on flooring panels, stuttering stops that sound like rivet guns, and, of course, bodies hitting the ground.If youre hurt, let me know, one coach yells to a fallen skater. If not, get back in line.The physical training is intense and demanding. One day this spring, about 10 skaters were practicing the techniques that allow each sides primary skater, or jammer, to completely circle the track and score points  and techniques to stop her. Contact is inherent in the sport, and for some is its primary appeal.Clare Higgins, 16, who was once known as Clare Beware but goes by her real name now, grew up on the Jersey Shore playing a variety of sports. She found her passion for roller derby in 2011 and joined the juniors two years ago. She commutes from Eatontown, N.J., about two hours away, for training sessions several times a week in addition to Saturdays.Roller derby has given me satisfaction like no other, said Clare, who will travel to the Junior Olympics in Nebraska with a regional all-star team in July. I can never go a day without thinking about it.Jatuan Flash, or Juggernaut Jatuan, 10, was never a fan of traditional sports, or sweating in general, but became interested in roller derby after seeing the 2009 film Whip It, about a misfit teenager who finds her identity through the sport.The movie made me feel like I would be really good at that sport because it was pretty much knocking people over on roller skates and I can knock people over, but what I really like is that Ive made a lot of new friends and we all support each other, Jatuan said. It is my thing.This spirit of camaraderie and personal empowerment appeals to most of the participants, and gets many novices past their fear of the physically demanding sport.When I first walked into the roller derby area it was kind of intimidating, said Blossom, um, Dark Pixie.There were girls hitting into each other aggressively and women skating backward and doing jumps, she explained. But now I love it! I love that one minute you can hit your friends off the track and onto the floor and the next youre hugging each other and arranging sleepovers."}
{"text": "A German flag with a barely noticeable strip of lace added to its bottom serves as a stage curtain at the beginning of The Underpants, a comedy adapted by Steve Martin from a German farce by Carl Sternheim, at Guild Hall in East Hampton.That delicate edging is the last bit of subtlety to be found in this production, which almost immediately devolves into a loud, in-your-face spectacle that shamelessly begs for laughs and applause.Two beer hall girls, not usually part of Mr. Martins play, come skipping out to lead the rest of the cast in a prancing musical introduction, clapping their hands emphatically in a way that suggests that audience members put their hands together, too. The jolly clapping, by all the actors, pops up during every scene change as well.Mr. Martins satirical play, which had an Off-Broadway run in 2002 and has often been revived, seems more strained than it has to be in this version, directed by Bill Fennelly. The production originated at Syracuse Stage last year with largely the same cast. The stylized acting is actually carried off nicely by the performers, including those who introduce the show, Hollybeth Gourlay and Margot Plum, the charming dirndl-clad Mdchen. Its all just too unrelenting.The story centers on an incident that befell a nave young housewife named Louise Maske, whose underpants somehow slipped down to her ankles as she stood on her toes trying to see the king pass by in a parade. The year is 1910, and the mere glimpse of billowy bloomers causes a sensation. Everyone in Dsseldorf knows about it, including Louises surly civil-servant husband, Theo. I cant believe this happened to me! he blurts out in outrage.Marianna McClellan deftly portrays Louise, a sweet young woman who later learns about the conniving ways of the world and how to deal with them. She even manages to keep an innocent demeanor as Louise experiences extreme lust and later is seen copulating, in choreographed simulations. (The plays schoolboy smuttiness also comes from Mr. Martins script, which abounds in double entendres, though it also contains several respectably amusing and clever jokes, like one involving a newspaper headline.) Mark David Watson plays Theo as blustery rather than dangerous, though its hard to say how he is supposed to be interpreted, since he also turns out to be anti-Semitic.That Jew-hating aspect of a Germans psyche  which Mr. Martin clearly intends as a foreshadowing of the Nazi era, not a characters personal quirk  reveals itself after two men visit Theo and Louises apartment, both seeking to rent an extra room that is being advertised. It turns out that the two men had witnessed Louises accident, had become smitten and simply wanted to be near her.Louise rents the room to Frank Versati, a flamboyant poet who woos her aggressively. (Daniel Passer, though he overdoes the foppish part, wrings all the humor he can from a hat-and-coat-tossing shtick, whether he hits the hooks he aims for or not.) But Theo has promised the room to one Benjamin Cohen, who is forced to deny that he is Jewish. (Michael Brian Dunn, who plays Cohen, is also gifted at physical comedy, in particular his mastery of wobbly legs.)Mr. Martin no doubt meant well in highlighting the mistrust and distaste of Jews by non-Jewish countrymen in early-20th-century Germany, but his approach is discomforting. He has Benjamin making mistakes that would give him away, saying (or almost saying) words like oy or shalom, and then attempting to cover them up in an American vernacular that is both unlikely and stereotypical.An annoying affectation that runs through the play is the use of German accents for comic effect by characters who are, after all, speaking their native language, in which they would not have accents. The exception is Versati, who speaks with an exaggerated Italian accent. The production looks good, with the help of Raquel Barretos delightful costumes and William Bloodgoods bright period set.In another major role, Sabrina Profitt plays Gertrude Deuter, a nosy upstairs neighbor who encourages the browbeaten and sex-starved Louise to have an affair, both to have some fun and to liberate herself. Ms. Profitt tackles the brassy part with gusto, landing her comic lines and frequently lewd gestures with superb timing. Gertrude helps to highlight some of the feminist aspects that Mr. Martin has interpolated into the Sternheim comedy. The play by Mr. Martin is very much an adaptation, not a translation. As a summertime production in a resort town, it is suitably lightweight  and might feel lighter if it didnt try so hard to be funny."}

For the photographer Danny Lyon, the world of live humans has been the bigger draw. You put a camera in my hand, he once said, I want to get close to people.

Driven by concern for the marginalized and the disenfranchised and belief in photography as a truth teller, he chronicled civil rights protests in the South, the adventures of a Chicago motorcycle gang and the lives of prisoners in Texas.Selections from each of these series, all of which were made into books now eagerly sought by collectors, are in Danny Lyon: Message to the Future, an engrossing new exhibition of about 175 photographs at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The revelation of the show, however, is a group of three rarely seen documentary films, a genre he turned to at the end of the 60s when he began to feel that conventional photographs could no longer contain his ambitions. (The exhibition was organized by Julian Cox, a curator at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. It will open at the de Young Museum in San Francisco in November.)The earliest of the films is Soc. Sci. 127 (1969), a riveting, 21-minute portrait of the tattoo artist Bill Sanders. It begins with Mr. Sanders in a suit and tie lecturing to a classroom of college-age people on the history of tattooing. This was a kind of joke staged by Mr. Lyon. Its followed by scenes of Mr. Sanderss real life in his squalid tattoo parlor, where we see him inking a mans buttocks, drawing a flower on a womans bare breast with a marker and drunkenly proffering more or less obnoxious opinions about sex and politics. Sweaty, overweight and generally repellent, hes like a giant frog in a downbeat fairy tale. Yet Mr. Lyon views him with such affectionate generosity that you cant help liking him.Dear Mark (1981) is a 15-minute, black-and-white portrait of the sculptor Mark di Suvero, a close friend of Mr. Lyon. Composed of footage shot in the 1960s and 70s, it shows the shirtless Mr. di Suvero working heroically on one or another of his monumental assemblages and ends with shots of medieval armor displays at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, accompanied to comical effect by the soundtrack of an old Gene Autry movie.Best of all is Willie (1985), an 82-minute documentary in color and black and white about Willie Jaramillo, a hapless prison recidivist. He was among a group of semi-delinquent boys in Bernalillo, N.M., where Mr. Lyon and his family lived during the 1970s. Willie cuts back and forth between early black-and-white footage of the boys aimlessly hanging out and scenes in color of Mr. Jaramillo as a troubled adult. Mr. Lyon filmed and talked with him through jail cell bars in institutions where he was regularly consigned for disorderly conduct and assault. There are brief conversations with other prisoners, some of whom come off as highly entertaining characters. Numerous scenes occur outside prison, including one long passage in which Mr. Jaramillo sits in boxer shorts on a dirt river bank under a highway overpass, smoking, drinking beer and reflecting on his life. At one point, he sings the hymn The Old Rugged Cross with heartbreaking earnestness. Its a beautiful and sad moment.Seeing Willie helps to explain why Mr. Lyon shifted his focus away from still photography, for however artfully composed, the photograph remains a static and silent object. The photos of racial strife he made in the early 60s while traveling through the South with members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee show black men and women being manhandled by the police; a standoff between whites and blacks outside a whites-only swimming pool; and police officers making vulgar gestures toward his camera, among other images. But seeing Mr. Lyons films, you could wonder how much more powerful these pictures might have been as moving images with sound.So, too, with the pictures he shot while spending time with the Chicago Outlaws Motorcycle Club in the mid-60s. Riding With the Outlaws, notes a museum label, Lyon attempted to capture their way of life from the inside out. Yet these images of scruffy, denim-clad men and their girlfriends are curiously lacking in the sort of violence and criminality such groups have been known for.As if he was already well aware of the limits of photography, Mr. Lyon taped conversations with club members and included transcripts of the dialogues in his best-known book, The Bikeriders, published in 1968. But Hunter S. Thompsons Hells Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga, from 1966, took readers far deeper into the shadowy, scary world of the rebel bikers.In the exhibition, you can hear a taped interview with Kathy, a mother of three who was married to one of the Outlaws, along with other subjects, including a transgender woman from Galveston, Tex., named Pumpkin Rene.For his prison photographs of 1967 and 68, Mr. Lyon secured permission from the Texas Department of Corrections, which gave him unusual access. But it didnt evidently enable him to document the kinds of brutality, corruption and craziness such places often harbor.Images of prisoners subjected to strip searches, working outdoors under the watch of armed guards and posing for individual portraits behind bars attest to a world of considerable harshness. Yet Mr. Lyons empathetic tendency to dignify his subjects has the paradoxical effect of making these places seem less terrible than they most likely were.One series, The Destruction of Lower Manhattan, consists of pictures that hold their own as still images. Made in 1966 and 1967, when many old buildings were being demolished to make way for the World Trade Center, the photographs document empty rooms and lofts that seem haunted by ghosts of their former inhabitants. Like Eugne Atgets photographs of antique architecture in fin-de-sicle Paris, these have a mournful, meditative quality, a poetry of silence and loss.Mr. Lyon, now 74, hasnt abandoned still photography altogether. Over the past four decades he has traveled widely, photographing street urchins in Colombia, Occupy protesters in Oakland, Calif., and Los Angeles, and coal miners in China. Examples in the exhibition vividly convey Mr. Lyons unflagging, Whitmanesque sympathy for the earths least powerful people.Now its time for a full-scale retrospective of all his films."}
{"text": "Argentina provides a fine introduction to that countrys traditional music and dance for those already familiar with it. The contradiction in that statement is why this pretty film is also a frustrating one.The director, Carlos Saura (Flamenco, Flamenco), has captured a wide array of artists as they perform the folk music and dances that were either indigenous to the country or born of the collision of native and Spanish cultures. He keeps the stagings sparse and the accompanying information even sparser. The art forms are identified  zamba, carnavalito, chacarera doble  but if you want to know their origins and other details, do your homework in advance. The performers are not identified until the closing credits.For Argentina, where rock and pop are much in evidence, and dances developed in cities, like the tango, can seem dominant, the film is perhaps in the same class as the work of Alan Lomax in the United States: It seeks to preserve traditions and educate about them. There is a nationalistic component to this rediscovery, an imperative to embrace the countrys past, its agricultural heritage and its pain.This zamba, it sings, one lyric says, and that gives me my name  ends with an anguished cry.For the non-Argentine audience, though, more context would have helped these wonderful songs and dances tell the nations story."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  President Johnson served notice on North Vietnam yesterday [June 18] that the United States will raise the cost of aggression at its source by intensified use of air power. His stern warning at the White House news conference evoked speculation that the United States is now prepared to extend air attacks to oil and other supply dumps in North Vietnam. This wider air action reportedly was imminent just before the outbreak of political turmoil in South Vietnam in March.In one of the most determined administration statements on Vietnam, Mr. Johnson expressly left open any increases in our forces and our operations in Vietnam. The president appeared intent on putting maximum military and psychological pressure on North Vietnam in the weeks ahead. He made it clear he believes this course represents the majority view in the United States. He omitted his usual assurances that the United States is risking no wider war and that it is knocking on all doors to seek negotiation.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, June 20, 1966"}
{"text": "PARIS  More than 300 people have been arrested in France since the Euro 2016 soccer tournament began last week, and 24 are being deported after violent clashes between fans, the French authorities said Thursday. The violence has marred the start of the event and heightened security concerns in a country that is still under high alert for terrorist threats.Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said in a statement on Thursday that 323 people had been arrested in connection with instances of violence, theft and vandalism since the tournament began on June 10, and that 196 of them had been temporarily detained.Eight of those detained have already appeared in court and were sentenced to prison, Mr. Cazeneuve said, and three received suspended prison sentences.On Thursday, three other men, all Russian citizens, were sentenced to one to two years in prison and barred from returning to France for two years after their release for their role in violent clashes in the southern port city of Marseille.French law gives prosecutors the ability to put people on trial immediately after their temporary detention ends, but only for some offenses, not serious crimes, and only when the facts of the case are clearly established, like when offenders are caught in the act, for instance.Twenty-four people are being deported from France in connection with violence during the Euro tournament, Mr. Cazeneuve said.Twenty of them are Russian men, 25 to 40 years old, who clashed with English soccer fans and the French police in Marseille on June 11, said Stphane Bouillon, the regional prefect.UEFA, the body that oversees European soccer, has already fined the Russian soccer federation and warned that the Russian team could be disqualified from the tournament if similar incidents continued inside stadiums.Supporters use of flares in stadiums and the repeated presence of fans on the field have prompted security concerns.The Russian men, who are being detained, were arrested in Mandelieu, a city in the Alpes-Maritimes administrative department that is about 100 miles east of Marseille, Mr. Bouillon said. They are expected to leave French territory on Monday.New incidents involving soccer fans and the police have occurred this week, although none have reached the levels of chaos and violence in Marseille.In Lille, where the authorities worried that English and Russian supporters would clash again on Wednesday during Russias game against Slovakia, the local prefecture said in a statement that there had been limited scuffles provoked mostly by drunken British nationals.The police used tear gas to disperse the fans, the prefecture said, even though there were no brawls between English and Russian citizens or between supporters of the teams and the police; no one was severely hurt. The police arrested 37 people and put 15 of them in temporary custody, the statement said.In Lyon, a Frenchman and a Belgian were lightly wounded by unidentified assailants wielding sharp objects in a fan-zone where supporters had gathered to watch France play Albania.The assailants are thought to be Albanian supporters, but no arrests have been made, and the weapons used to wound the two men were not found, according to local authorities.The Euro soccer tournament, which runs until July 10, has magnified worries about security in France, which is still under the state of emergency that was declared after the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people in and near Paris.The killings of a police officer and his companion near Paris on Monday, by a man who said he acted in the name of the Islamic State, have compounded those fears.The man, identified as Larossi Abballa, 25, was killed by an elite police unit. He warned in an online video beforehand that the Euro will be a cemetery, referring to the soccer tournament, although it was unclear whether Mr. Abballa had specific knowledge of a plot.France eased its gun rules in response to the attack, announcing on Wednesday that it would allow off-duty police officers to carry their sidearms even after the state of emergency comes to an end in late July."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Federal regulators on Thursday took up the fight for their right to label certain financial institutions as too big to fail after a Federal District Court threw out their designation of the insurance company MetLife earlier this year.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body of regulators led by the Treasury Department, said in April that it would contest the decision, shortly after the ruling was handed down. Late Thursday, the government filed its first substantive brief in its appeal.The Dodd-Frank Act gave the council, which includes the heads of the banking agencies, the authority to designate large nonbanks as systemically important to prevent the kind of fallout seen from the near-collapse of American International Group during the height of the financial crisis. The institutions so designated will be subject to greater capital requirements and regulatory scrutiny.The district court overturned the collective judgment of the heads of the nations financial regulatory agencies that material distress at MetLife could pose a threat to the countrys financial stability, the council, which is being represented by the Justice Department, said in the brief. The courts ruling leaves one of the largest, most complex and most interconnected financial companies in the country without the regulatory oversight that Congress found essential.In addition to MetLife, regulators have designated A.I.G., Prudential Financial and General Electrics finance unit, though G.E. has applied to have the systemically important label removed after shedding significant assets.MetLife, which filed its case against the government in January 2015, is the only company to combat the label in court so far. Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ultimately ruled in favor of the insurer in March.The judge said that the council had failed to assess the likelihood of MetLifes going under and the impact that severe material distress at the company would have on the financial system at large. Judge Collyer also said that regulators should have weighed the costs and benefits of the designation.The council sought to address those concerns head-on in its filing on Thursday with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, calling the lower court judges analysis of its efforts profoundly mistaken. It also argues that the financial reform law does not require the council to take into account costs or any other effect of designation on the company as part of its decision process.A MetLife spokesman declined to comment except to say said that the company will respond to the governments brief in its own filing by Aug. 15.Supporters of the council will file amicus briefs with the court next week. A date has not been set for oral arguments, though the hearing is likely to be scheduled for sometime this fall.We continue to believe that the council acted well within its legal authority in designating MetLife and are vigorously defending the councils work on appeal, the Treasury said in a statement."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Contrary to the claim made in your June 6 editorial Brazils Gold Medal for Corruption, Brazilian members of Congress and ministers enjoy no immunity from prosecution under most circumstances, nor against punishment for crimes. They enjoy the prerogative of jurisdiction, by which those authorities are tried by the Federal Supreme Court.Moreover, the editorial bases its conclusion on a fundamentally flawed assumption: that Brazils state institutions are subject to the whims of politics. This is an outdated view of Brazil.Brazilian democracy has steadily matured during the last three decades. A proof of that is the fact that we are now in the midst of a second impeachment process of a president in less than 25 years, always under the strictest observance of the constitutional order.Brazils Public Prosecutors Office, the Federal Police, government agencies and the judicial system itself rely on the wide support of a society that tolerates neither corruption nor complacency in the face of corruption. There is no more room in Brazil to give shelter to the friends of the powerful. The law is the same for all  including presidents and former presidents.Acting President Michel Temer has stated publicly  and repeatedly  his firm commitment to the continuation of the investigations that are underway, free from any political or partisan discrimination.Brazil should be awarded a gold medal not for corruption, but, on the contrary, for courage in the fight against corruption.LUIZ ALBERTO FIGUEIREDO MACHADOAmbassador of BrazilWashington"}
{"text": "My Saint Laurent is not going to be Hedi Slimanes Saint Laurent. Its time to start afresh  kind of.Thats the fairly clear message from Anthony Vaccarellos first public statement as creative director of YSL. Which is to say: his first ad campaign.Released on Friday, the campaign is attached to no particular season or product. Indeed, there are pretty much no products visible at all (perhaps because Mr. Vaccarello has not yet shown any products for the house). An ad campaign for a fashion house without any real fashion in it?Indeed, think of it as a mission statement instead of a marketing exercise. And as far as a mission statement goes, it can be mostly summed up as: 15 unknowns, women and men, stripped to their bare skin. He is paring away the fuss, the better to rebuild.Much was made when Mr. Slimane left (after months of speculation and breast-beating in the fashion community) over the question of whether Mr. Vaccarello would, as Mr. Slimane did when he arrived in 2012, change everything at YSL, or whether he would be charged with effectively continuing a pallid version of the aesthetic Mr. Slimane had created. The campaign would indicate the answer is neither one nor the other, but somewhere in between.It was not shot by Mr. Vaccarello himself, the way most of the ad campaigns under the famously controlling Mr. Slimane were shot by Mr. Slimane, but by the American photographer Collier Schorr. It continues Mr. Slimanes focus on youth, and is black and white, as were many of Mr. Slimanes ads. But the youth it celebrates is not that of the grungy Los Angeles music scene, one of Mr. Slimanes obsessions; it is not youth identified with any particular place or fetish, except for a certain comfort and delight in the body. Which suggests we may be in for some sex.Well, all of Mr. Vaccarellos past work under his own name suggested the same thing, so thats not really a surprise.The ads are the beginning of a carefully orchestrated rollout of Mr. Vaccarellos vision for YSL. They will be followed on Monday by an updating of the YSL website and Instagram account, which somewhat controversially got wiped clean of its Slimane content after the designers departure. The rollout will culminate in October with Mr. Vaccarellos first Saint Laurent womens wear show in Paris.At which point everyone may have become so used to Mr. Vaccarellos messaging they will have forgotten Mr. Slimanes version (fashion memories are pretty short), and whatever shape the new collection takes, it may have less the shock of a freezing plunge in a pool than the pleasant embrace of a warm bath. There are currently a lot of complaints going around about how social media is to blame for consumer product saturation/boredom, but when it comes to getting people inured to a brands new identity, it does have its uses."}
{"text": "CLEVELAND  After it slowly sank in on Thursday night, after Stephen Curry realized he had been ejected from a game for the first time in his N.B.A. career, all he could do was perform penance for his behavior.It began with a long, deliberate exit from the court. Curry was jeered by a ravenous capacity crowd in Cleveland as he passed the scorers table and then his own bench, where he paused for a moment before continuing his perp walk to the locker room.There Curry sat as he considered his circumstances. He had to wait out the final 4 minutes 22 seconds while the Cleveland Cavaliers put the last touches on their emphatic 115-101 Game 6 victory over Currys Golden State Warriors and sent the N.B.A. finals back to Oakland, Calif., for a deciding Game 7 on Sunday.I just sat in my chair, Curry said later at a news conference. Ive never been ejected before, so it was a weird feeling. It was just frustration and also kind of, like you said, I thought it was kind of hilarious the way the last two fouls and me blowing up kind of unfolded and some of the things that were said out there.It was as if all of the events of the last week had congealed for Curry: the suspension of his teammate Draymond Green for Game 5; the loss of another teammate, Andrew Bogut, to injury; the jousting with LeBron James; and finally, his brief, but startling, loss of cool late in Game 6, when he flung his mouthpiece into the stands after he had fouled out and was immediately tossed from the scene by the referees.On Friday, the N.B.A. fined Curry and Warriors Coach Steve Kerr $25,000 each for their outbursts about the officiating in the game.Specifically, Curry was fined for throwing his mouthpiece, which hit a person in the stands, and Kerr was fined for his public criticism of the officiating at a postgame news conference.No team has ever lost a three-games-to-one lead in the N.B.A. finals, but the mighty Warriors, who for the past week have been on the cusp of back-to-back titles, are now in danger of doing just that.And it showed the depths of the Warriors exasperation that it was not the combustible Green or the sometimes feisty Kerr who blew up as Game 6 slipped away for good, but the cherublike Curry.There is nothing in his entire time in the league that would tell you this is anything other than frustration that had built up, Warriors forward Harrison Barnes said of Currys mouthpiece misdemeanor.Curry said, I had some stuff I wanted to get off my chest tonight after the way the game went, and that was it.Watching Game 6 unfold the way it did was apparently too much for Currys wife, Ayesha, as well. She wrote on Twitter that Game 6 was rigged, for either money or TV ratings. I wont be silent, she wrote.But then she was. She deleted the post shortly after it appeared, and as she and Currys parents waited for him outside the locker room, she wiped away tears and shielded her eyes while they were affixed to her phone.She waved away a reporter who approached, saying, Im fine, thank you.The N.B.A. was powerless to fine Currys wife, but Curry was a different story, although he did quickly apologize to the fan he had struck with the mouthpiece. And Kerrs fine was a no-brainer, as he had opened his postgame news conference by calmly, but directly, criticizing the officials for three of the six fouls called on Curry, terming them absolutely ridiculous. Kerr also called out the official who levied the sixth foul, Jason Phillips, by name.Let me be clear, we did not lose because of the officiating, Kerr said. But three of the six fouls were incredibly inappropriate calls for anybody, much less the M.V.P. of the league.Kerr, seeking to set the tone for the officiating in Game 7, was not the only one playing mind games. LeBron James, whom Kerr accused of flopping on Currys final foul, went out of his way to bump Curry after making a layup on Thursday night and, in another sequence, barked at Curry after swatting away his shot near the basket.Curry, whose layup attempt after the buzzer in Game 5 was also blocked by James, answered with little other than a smile late Thursday when asked about his star rival.However he wants to celebrate or whatever he wants to do to kind of take in that moment, it is what it is, Curry said. I stay aggressive  dont let him get in my head.The Warriors have not been the aggressors in three of the last four games. It took them more than five minutes to score in Game 6, and they missed 21 of their first 25 shots. They trailed by as many as 24 points in the third quarter, and the Cavaliers withstood each run the Warriors made.Curry was whistled for his fifth foul with 9:49 left in the fourth quarter after he had poked the ball away from Kyrie Irving. Later came the sixth foul when James and Curry made contact with each other. At that point, the mouthpiece went flying.Nobody on the Warriors seemed bothered by Currys outburst. In fact, some players said they were buttressed by it.Absolutely, Klay Thompson said when asked if the Warriors needed to play angry on Sunday. Play angry, but dont play with so much emotion it takes you out of your focus. But 100 percent play angry. We feel like we could have closed it out a long time ago, but here we are.When the locker room opened 30 minutes after Game 6 had ended, Curry was still in his uniform. He got up from his locker to toss a banana peel in a trash can, then sat down to take off his sneakers, remove his jersey, shorts and compression wear and peel away the bandages on his right knee.His mood seemed light as he joked with teammate Brandon Rush.Later, as he sat on the podium and answered questions, he took comfort in the thought of returning home, where the Warriors have thrived all season playing in front of raucous crowds of their own. He said it was all he and his teammates could ask for, the chance to win one game and a championship.And if it happens, Curry will not be walking off the court alone."}
{"text": "OAKMONT, Pa.  For an old, cantankerous blue blood of a course, Oakmont Country Club has shown a surprising tolerance of youth. It has accommodated a 22-year-old Jack Nicklauss coronation at the 1962 United States Open at the expense of the older, more popular Arnold Palmer; a 26-year-old Johnny Millers crowning in 1973; and a 24-year-old Ernie Elss major title baptism in 1994.The deep-bunkered, hunchbacked dowagers patience for golfers who got to the top in a mad rush has apparently worn thin. In the first round of the 116th United States Open, which took two days to complete, Oakmont smiled on the fields elders and spanked some young stars.The Englishman Lee Westwood led the 40-something brigade with a three-under-par 67. Westwood, Henrik Stenson, Angel Cabrera, Jim Furyk, Retief Goosen, Phil Mickelson and Els average 44.9 years. Their first-round scores averaged 71.3.Westwood, whose sense of humor is drier than a baked green, said he would lean on his 20-plus years of experience to ride out a long week that became more mentally and physically challenging when the tournament lost almost a full day of play on Thursday to a series of electrical storms.Yeah, Ill probably cut down on the gym sessions and save the energy in my legs, he said with a straight face. Westwood later laughed when he finished describing himself as the finely tuned athlete that I am.It is early, of course, but when the light turned green at Oakmont, the family sport-utility vehicles with the balding tires were off the line faster than the sleek, late-model sedans.The South Korean-born New Zealander Danny Lee led the 20-something upstarts with a 69. The drop-off after that was precipitous. Lee, top-ranked Jason Day, second-ranked Jordan Spieth, third-ranked Rory McIlroy, fifth-ranked Rickie Fowler, ninth-ranked Danny Willett and 11th-ranked Patrick Reed average 26.0 years. Their first-round scores averaged 74.1.After signing for a 72, Spieth said: Youve got to stay patient, recognize pars a good score. Thats something were not used to.Day, 28, came into the week head and shoulders above the rest of the field, with three victories and a 69.92 stroke average. Of his 37 competitive stroke-play rounds in 2016, 16 were in the 60s.I feel good about where Im at right now with regards to my game, he said Tuesday, and Oakmont rolled her eyes. On Friday, he opened with a 76. A little over an hour later, Day returned to the course for his second round, where he needed to shoot a low number to make the cut.It was Days first competitive interaction with Oakmont, and she welcomed him by cutting him down like the tall trees on the course that distorted everybodys view. Days first round was capsulized by his fortunes at the par-4 17th, where he hit his approach pin high and three-putted for bogey.Day found nine fairways and eight greens and had 31 putts, surprising numbers for someone who had posted only one round higher than two-over par all year, a 79 in the third round of the RBC Heritage the week after the Masters.Before Oakmont swallowed up Day, he said the most stressful round he had endured in 2016 was the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he scrambled for a closing 70 to hang on for the win.I felt out of control, Day said about that invitational. It was just one of those weeks where I did not know where the ball was going.His distress Friday took a different form. Tee to green he was fine, Days caddie, Colin Swatton, said between rounds. He chipped it three times on one hole, twice on another, had two three-putts.The first round was Days fifth in a major since he claimed the world No. 1 ranking from Spieth for the second time in late March. It was also his fifth since winning the P.G.A. Championship last year. His average score in those rounds was 73.0.Is Day trying too hard in the majors to live up to the super golfer image that he associated with being a major winner and the world No. 1 when he was a kid growing up in Australia?Swatton said he did not believe that was the case. But at his Tuesday news conference, Day acknowledged that the pressure didnt peel away after his major breakthrough last August at Whistling Straits. It remains a constant companion.Im No. 1 in the world, Im probably one of the favorites to win this week, still thats a lot of pressure, Day said. But its good pressure to have. Id much rather have that pressure than be at the end of the field and no one is expecting you to win.Days strategy, he said, then, is like, O.K., Ive just got to somehow survive this week and hopefully it works out.Perhaps Oakmont was less harsh to the old guard because she knows it has dealt with so much worse than her tangled rough: divorce; parents deaths; childrens disabilities; legal entanglements. Or maybe it takes decades of experience to handle a 113-year-old Oakmont, which still possesses all her teeth."}

{"text": "Russia, a perpetual powerhouse at the Olympics, sent more than 400 athletes to the last Summer Games, in London in 2012. At the opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro in seven weeks, the countrys delegation may appear relatively meager during the parade of nations in Maracan Stadium.Russias track and field team, which won 18 medals in London, has been barred from competing in Rio, a ruling by the sports governing body announced on Friday that carries historical and political weight. No such penalty had ever been levied in the history of the Olympics. And Russian officials have claimed that interests beyond sports motivated the judgment against the countrys sports regime.For American TV viewers, it may amount to little more than a minor subplot in NBCs telecast.If I were doing the opening ceremony, Id say something like, While there isnt the Cold War we grew up with, clearly there has been friction between Russia and the U.S. and very often for the Summer Games, said Bob Costas, who will anchor NBCs broadcast but will not call the parade of nations.So while its not the same as it was when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were going at it in the 1960s and 70s, it does take something away, Costas said.The absence of the Russian track and field team is unlikely to hurt NBCs prime-time ratings for several reasons, among them the likelihood that the removal of a major rival might help the United States win more medals.I cant see there being any impact, said Dick Ebersol, a former chairman of NBC Sports. Anything that helps you win more medals is a help.Mike Weisman, a former executive producer of NBC Sports, who ran the production of the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, said: It helps if a power like Russia isnt there. The United States will be in more finals and win more medals.Weisman recalled that the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles helped raise the United States medal count.When we did 88, we used as a selling point that unlike 1984, when all the best athletes werent there, this will be the best non-boycotted Olympics, with all the great athletes, Weisman said. But in events like gymnastics, we didnt have a woman in the top 10. When we finished the gymnastics prelims, we said: Watch the next few nights. Youll see the East Germans, the Romanians and the Russians  tell your friends and neighbors.In 1984, the United States medal count of 40 (including 16 golds) in track and field dwarfed the 11 won by the second-place nation, West Germany. Four years later, the United States and the Soviet Union tied with 26 medals in track and field.NBCs prime-time Olympic broadcasts are not overly dependent on track and field. The first week is dominated heavily by gymnastics and swimming and diving before track and field takes over in the second week. Ebersol said NBC was ideally set up to thrive without the Russian track and field team. Most of the American audience is hardly familiar with the top Russian athletes, despite the countrys historical success in track and field.You cant tell me that there are star Russian athletes who are familiar to American viewers like Valery Brumel, he said, referring to the Soviet high jumper who won a silver medal in the 1960 Olympics and a gold four years later.In 2012, NBCs four highest-rated nights of Olympic competition from London featured gymnastics (the top three featured the women), and the fifth featured the mens 100-meter final but also included diving and gymnastics. In Beijing four years earlier, gymnastics and swimming were also the featured events on four of the five highest-rated nights. The third-ranked night included the mens 100 meters, swimming and the womens marathon. (Russia would not have had a medal contender in this years mens 100 meters.)Ebersol, who was instrumental in the deal-making that brought many Olympics to NBC, said the disciplinary action against the Russian track and field team by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the sports governing body, was as strong and complete a statement on doping and what will happen to you if you systematically cheat.This is great for all sport and anybody who wants a real step forward in clean competition, Ebersol said. The I.A.A.F. was strong and clear and direct in interpreting longtime rules.Brazilians, meanwhile, probably feel as if they cannot get a break.As South Americas largest country prepares to host the Summer Games, that nation of 200 million has been buffeted by an unending torrent of bad news.The oceanside host city is buckling under a surge in violent crime amid a national Zika epidemic that has spooked athletes and spectators alike.Investigators are looking into an enormous bribery scheme involving the construction of Olympic venues. And a wave that struck an elevated waterfront cycling lane in April sent two men tumbling to their deaths.When the Games begin on Aug. 5, Brazilians who tune in to the opening ceremony on television may be forced to toggle between Olympic pageantry and the spectacle of their once-popular president on trial.With the news that Russias formidable track and field team had been barred from competing, many Brazilians could only shake their heads and hope for the best.Its an honor to have the games in our country, but Im scared to death that Brazil will be embarrassed during the Olympic Games, said Milton Neves, 65, a journalist at the Rede Bandeirantes television network. Brazil does not deserve to have the Olympics.Hosting a multibillion-dollar international sports event is never an easy endeavor, but ordinary Brazilians, veteran sports officials and foreign analysts agree on one thing: As it prepares to host thousands of athletes and a half-million spectators, Brazil is juggling a head-spinning array of challenges.The country is enduring its most severe economic crisis in decades, and an extensive corruption scandal involving the state-run oil behemoth Petrobras has ensnared many members of the political business elite. The suspension last month of President Dilma Rousseff, who faces impeachment over accusations that she manipulated the federal budget, has largely paralyzed the government.I feel very anxious to have the Olympics in our backyard, said Fernanda Seiffert, 38, a technology consultant from So Paulo who has bought tickets to the Games. People are quite disillusioned about Brazil economically and politically, so I dont know if we will see much patriotism from Brazilian fans. This is quite sad.On the streets of Rios Copacabana neighborhood, there were few outward signs on Friday that the worlds most hallowed sport competition was about to begin. Still, many Cariocas, as the citys residents are called, said they expected public enthusiasm to surge as the Games drew nearer.The Games will bring us more work; I have hope, said Marilene Margarida do Nascimento, 47, who gives massages on Rios iconic Copacabana beach.For many, news that the Russians have been barred for their nations role in a colossal doping conspiracy was viewed as a positive development.Carlos Garcia, 35, an announcer for Rdio Transamrica, said the ban would send an important message to all Olympic athletes that doping is unacceptable.Sports competitions are full of good examples of overcoming obstacles, he said. Examples like these make up the beautiful history of the Olympic Games. Anyone who does not respect the basic rules of fair play and sportsmanship does not meet the requirements to be part of this story."}
{"text": "For Muhammad Hannan and other Muslim high school students in New York City, this has been a Ramadan of contrasts and conflicting emotions.The joy of breaking a 16-hour fast with the first bite of a sweet date. The horror of hearing about the attack on a gay nightclub in Florida that left 49 dead. The drudgery of reviewing a years worth of earth sciences and trigonometry notes. The frustration of defending Islam  and the right to be in this country  after another terrorist attack carried out in the name of the Islamic State.I just dont get it, said Muhammad, a 17-year-old junior at Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island, Brooklyn, who immigrated from Pakistan with his family in 2014. Islam is all about peace. In Ramadan, we dont even curse. Youre not supposed to do anything bad.Ramadan is usually Muhammads favorite time. This year, though, the holiday, which encompasses a month of fasting from dawn to dusk, has not offered its usual refuge. Already, Ramadan coincided with the Regents, the series of state tests that most high school students in New York take.Then on Sunday, a Muslim man born in New York, Omar Mateen, called 911 to proclaim his allegiance to ISIS and opened fire in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.Within a day, Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was renewing his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States.And the day after that, another student in Muhammads English class started echoing Mr. Trumps call.He was talking a lot of bad things, with no proof, Muhammad said of the classmate. Muhammad replied that there were differences between Muslims like Muhammad Ali and those like Omar Mateen.If you can tell the difference between white people and K.K.K., you can at least differentiate between Muslims and ISIS, Muhammad recalled arguing in class.How did that student respond? He said, Because Donald Trump said so, Muhammad said. Everybody in the class was laughing.Salwa Mozzeb, 15, who is finishing her freshman year at Millennium Brooklyn High School in Park Slope soundly dismissed Mr. Trumps proposal. Thats messed up, she said on Tuesday, wearing a hijab and speaking in a brassy Brooklyn accent. A naturalized United States citizen, she came with her mother from Syria when she was 9 months old. I was raised here, she said. America is my home.Salwa lives in a Bay Ridge apartment with her parents, grandmother and four younger siblings; she has uncles and cousins who live in the same building and on the same block. She volunteers at the Arab American Association of New York, whose headquarters are in Bay Ridge. Her mother, who is from Syria, has a brother who escaped the civil war there and made his way to Sweden. Another relative has been waiting 10 years for a visa to enter the United States.Once populated largely by Scandinavian immigrants, as well as those of Italian and Irish heritage, Bay Ridge has been transformed like so much of New York. There are nine mosques in the area now, according to Tony Carnes, a sociologist who publishes an online journal, A Journey Through N.Y.C. Religions. Many of the store signs on the avenues are written in Arabic.After the killings in Orlando, Salwas father, Abdulnoor Mozzeb, 39, a naturalized American citizen originally from Yemen, warned his daughter to be especially careful on the subway, and to sit near the conductor. The idea annoyed her. Im just like any other 15-year-old here, she said. I want to hang out and chill. I dont want to stress about feeling like Im different because Im Muslim.Mr. Mozzeb approved of her convictions. Shes strong, he said. When it comes to your identity, somebody is going to disrespect you, you got to stand up.Salwas mother, Manar Al Ahamar, said that in April, outside a pharmacy in Bay Ridge, an older woman had confronted her, telling her to go back to her country and cursing her in front of her 10-year-old son, Ahmed.Ms. Al Ahamar, 32, said she had just walked away, but had gotten so upset later that her blood pressure soared and she began to have severe chest pains. Salwa had helped her mother into in an ambulance. It was not until Wednesday that her mother revealed what had caused the emergency.Salwa did not understand how a woman could verbally attack her mother, especially in what she considers her own neighborhood. If she doesnt want to be surrounded by Muslims, Salwa said, why is she in this community?As for Muhammad, he spends his days in two Brooklyn neighborhoods dotted with mosques. He and his family live in Brighton Beach, and he volunteers at the Council of Peoples Organization, a group in Midwood that serves Muslims, Arabs and South Asians.In Brighton Beach, he and his older brother, Hassan, often attend a Turkish mosque up the block from their house, or one of three smaller mosques in the area. Though from the outside, Ramadan might seem to be a hardship  rising before dawn to eat, then going back to sleep before getting up again for school  Muhammad and his friends say it is more like a sweet respite.We get to fast, we get to stay close to Allah, we pray five times a day, Muhammad said. And after, when we pray at night, we go out with our friends and stay out till 1.Muhammad described the communal outdoor prayers in his hometown, Karachi, and how, with the streets closed, he and his friends would play cricket late into the night.He said he missed the Ramadan of his childhood, but understood why his family moved to the United States.My parents wanted us to have a good education, he said. He and Hassan, 21, who attends the Borough of Manhattan Community College, are permanent residents.Salwas parents want the same for their children. If you have education, you are a different person, said Salwas father, who works as a doorman at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan.The family lives half a block from their mosque at the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, decorated on the outside this month with strings of colored lights. At 10 p.m. every night, Salwa and her friends go through the womens entrance and, bypassing the hot, crowded third floor, climb to the roof.They stay there in the soft breeze as the last embers of sunset fade and the lights of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge twinkle in the background. Like most high school girls, they check their phones, compliment one another on their outfits and discuss their exam schedules, while younger children turn cartwheels nearby.When the prayers begin, the girls go into the stairwell so they can hear through the speakers, kneeling on the cold linoleum to be closer, spiritually, to Allah.Muhammad and his family usually pray at home before going to the mosque for evening prayers. Then, often until early morning, he and Hassan engage in philosophical debates in the room they share, discussions about American values versus their Pakistani upbringing.Usually, Muhammad said, its about sneakers.He wants to add to his Air Jordan collection, even at $250 a pair. His brother counters: You can feed four to five homeless people with that.Because of Ramadan, the brothers were awake before dawn on Sunday when the first reports of the massacre in Orlando began to appear on their phones. I was literally praying, Dont be a Muslim, Hassan said.Just the week before, the brothers had watched as America mourned one of its most famous Muslims, Muhammad Ali. They were proud. Now, they are hurt and angry.It takes people like Muhammad Ali to do good things for Islam, Muhammad said, and then it takes seconds for people like Omar Mateen to destroy everything."}

{"text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.  I usually start behind the neck, Grace Granatelli said from her plump brown sofa. Theres two pressure points back behind the ears that help relax them a little bit. In her lap, she held the head of Sketch, her mixed beagle rat terrier, as her fingers traced small circles through his fur.Ms. Granatelli, whose passion for dogs can be glimpsed in the oil portrait of her deceased pets and the bronzed casts of their paws, started an animal massage business during the recession after taking several courses and workshops. Her primary form of advertising was her car, with its K9 RUBS license plate and her website, Pawsitive Touch, stenciled onto her rear window.But in 2013, Arizonas Veterinary Medical Examining Board sent her a cease-and-desist order, demanding that she close up shop for medically treating animals without a veterinary degree. If not, the board warned, every Swedish doggy massage she completed could cost her a $1,000 fine.To comply with the ruling and obtain a license, Ms. Granatelli would have to spend about $250,000 over four years at an accredited veterinary school. None require courses in massage technique; many dont even offer one.Animal masseuses are hardly alone. Over the years, states across the country have added licensing requirements for a bewildering variety of jobs, requiring months or years of expensive education, along with assessing costly fees.Today, nearly 30 percent of the American work force needs a license to work, up from about 10 percent in the 1970s, according to Morris Kleiner, a professor of public affairs at the University of Minnesota, who has studied the issue.The Obama administration and the conservative political network financed by the Koch brothers dont agree on much, but the belief that the zeal among states for licensing all sorts of occupations has spiraled out of control is one of them. In recent months, they have collaborated with an array of like-minded organizations and political leaders in a bid to roll back licensing rules.On Friday, the White House announced that it would provide $7.5 million in grants to organizations interested in working with states to reduce overly burdensome licensing and make it easier for licensed practitioners to work across state lines, an issue of particular importance to military families.This grant is the first time the federal government has directly gotten involved to help states that want to reform their licensing practices, Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. It was something a Democratic president proposed and a Republican Congress passed.Economists on both the left and the right argue that excessive licensing raises prices for consumers without improving services; it can also deter potential workers from moving across state lines, dragging down employment growth.There is no labor economist who thinks it is good for the economy, said Lee U. McGrath, legislative counsel in Minnesota for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian organization whose lawyers are representing Ms. Granatelli in a lawsuit against the Arizona veterinary board.In Tennessee, a license is required to shampoo hair; in Florida, to sell a yacht. In Montana, you need the states approval to be an egg candler; in Utah, to repair upholstery; in Louisiana, to be a florist.No one disputes that health and safety concerns make licenses indispensable in certain demanding professions, like nursing or flying a commercial airplane, and they are sometimes helpful in improving standards and providing quality assurance to consumers.But the current mishmash of requirements is too often inconsistent, inefficient, and arbitrary, a White House report concluded last year. Many of them, the report said, have little purpose other than to protect those already in the field from further competition.Requirements for the same job often have whiplash-level variation. South Dakota requires 2,100 hours of education and a cosmetology license to braid hair  a popular entry point into the labor force for African-American women. South Carolina demands only a six-hour course.Security guards in Michigan need to have three years of training; none is needed in New Hampshire and Ohio.Why in the world do we regulate barbers? asked Mark Hutchison, a Republican and the lieutenant governor of Nevada, which shares billing with Arizona as one of the states with the most burdensome licensing requirements, according to the Institute for Justice. A bad haircut is the last thing that a person is going to put up with and return to. It is the ultimate example of self-regulating industry.The problem is particularly acute for military spouses, who move frequently, as well as veterans and immigrants, who may have extensive training but lack a particular states seal of approval. And there are at least 27,000 different licensing restrictions across the states affecting people with arrest and conviction records. Most of them permanently disqualify applicants, meaning a minor transgression as a teenager can prevent someone from working in many fields decades later.The most regulated states, paradoxically, are red. Even Republican governors with Republican legislatures in pretty conservative states have still found it extremely difficult to effect change, said Dick M. Carpenter, strategic director of the Institute for Justice. When there is an effort to dial back legislation, then the licensed industry turns out with huge counterattack. This is the same story that plays out in every state.Only rarely are licensing requirements removed. Last month, though, Arizona agreed to curb them for yoga teachers, geologists, citrus fruit packers and cremationists.But dozens more professions escaped the ax. Arizona is perceived as a low-regulatory state, but this was the most difficult bill we worked on this session, said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the Republican governor, Douglas Ducey.Licensing boards are generally dominated by members of the regulated profession. And in Arizona, more than two dozen of the boards are allowed to keep 90 percent of their fees, turning over a mere 10 percent of the revenue to the state.They use that money to hire contract lobbyists and P.R. people, Mr. Scarpinato said. This is really a dark corner of state government.They are often joined in their campaign by lobbyists from industry trade associations and for-profit colleges, which sell the required training courses.Economists like Mr. Kleiner say there are less burdensome ways to highlight quality. For example, certification, with an exam to ensure a certain skill level, could be required to use a particular job title  like certified tour guide or chartered financial analyst  without prohibiting others from offering the service, perhaps at a lower price.The power of licensing boards was challenged last year when the  Supreme Court ruled that the North Carolina dental board could be sued under federal antitrust laws for shutting down teeth-whiteners because they were not licensed dentists.The courts decision may prompt some states to monitor licensing boards more closely, said Robert C. Fellmeth, executive director of the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego.At the state level, the Institute for Justice has filed lawsuits arguing that various licensing boards are unconstitutionally interfering with the right to earn a living. That includes the one brought by Ms. Grantelli and two experienced horse massagers, Celeste Kelly and Stacey Kollman in Arizona.Victoria Whitmore, executive director of the vet board in Arizona, said the boards decision had been misinterpreted. It issued a cease-and-desist to stop practicing veterinary medicine, not to stop massaging, she said. The problem, the institutes lawyers say, is that there is no way for practitioners to figure out where to draw that line.Once the lawsuit is finished, Ms. Whitmore said, it is possible the board will offer more guidelines.Ms. Kelly, whose strong hands can zero in on a knotted muscle like a heat-seeking missile, said she was continuing to work despite the order from the licensing board. She grew up around horses at her fathers riding stable in Long Island and has taken several courses and workshops in equine massageLocal veterinarians have frequently referred horse owners to her. They dont want to do it, said Ms. Kelly, who charges $55 for an approximately 90-minute massage. It takes too long."}

{"text": "When my wife, Courtney, and I were expecting our first child just a few years ago, I was astonished by the almost instantaneous community of expectant and new mothers that greeted her. Despite the fact that wed just moved cross-country and didnt yet know many people, she was flooded with sage advice and a deep sense of community.It was impressive, and yet it often left me feeling like a bystander. As I watched the anticipation of these expectant mothers shift into weekly get-togethers with babies rolling around on blankets on the floor, I found myself envious and wondering: Where was the parallel universe of new dads?Online, I found several hip publications on fatherhood  from the popular website Fatherly to Charlie Capen and Andy Heralds widely read How to Be a Dad, and Designer Daddy, focused on getting creative with fatherhood. When our schedules aligned, my friend Peter and I would get vulnerable as we ran through the redwoods. Weve had several unforgettable conversations about impossibly hard stuff like the loss of his first son and others on the pressure to strike that perfect balance with our wives  who both always seem to be one step ahead of us in this whole parenting thing. Yet nothing seemed to approximate the collective conversations that were happening among my wife and her new mom friends.Economic and cultural shifts in the last decade have made fatherhood feel like uncharted territory in many ways. In the wake of the recession and the fracturing of the economy, many men, myself included, are less tied to a traditional workday as sole breadwinners. More than a third of American workers are now freelancers, according to an independent study commissioned by the Freelancers Union in 2014.Many men are increasingly moving beyond the bringing home the bacon mentality, and instead prioritizing the careers of wives who make more money than they do. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 28.2 percent of wives earned more than their husbands in 2014 (in families in which both wives and husbands have earnings). Back in 1987, when I was a kid, only 17.8 percent of American wives brought home more money than their husbands.These trends are creating entirely new opportunities and challenges for fathers: finding ourselves engaged with aspects of caretaking that many of our own fathers never experienced, more distracted at work, or even less career-oriented in some cases, again, like mine. Men and women, in a sense, are at least getting closer to being equal partners in this journey; according to the latest Pew surveys on modern parenthood, 56 percent of mothers and now 50 percent of fathers say juggling work and family life is difficult for them.After experiencing, often appreciating, and sometimes lamenting many of these dynamics for the first two years of our daughters life, I decided to try to bring some dads together to talk about our shared experience. I had a hunch that I wasnt the only one yearning for a community and some deeper conversation on fatherhood.I identified 28 relatively new fathers, mostly through my wifes friends, and finally worked up the courage to invite them. A stream of responses to my email invitation came promptly and enthusiastically.On a cool, Bay Area night, those two dozen eager dads (few of whom knew one another) showed up at our place with an enviable array of fancy cheeses, a homemade coffee cake, some Brussels sprouts smoked via some jury-rigged stovetop contraption, and no small amount of uncertainty about what the hell they were doing there. If all else failed, at least we wouldnt starve.Among us were both nonprofit and tech company workers, stay-at-home dads, a tattooed investment banker-turned-restaurateur, and a couple of writers, myself included. Most had one child; a few had two.Nervously excited and visibly breaking a sweat, I explained my reason for bringing the group together: to give new fathers a chance to talk honestly about the highs and lows of their new identity, together.Throughout our conversation, the mood in the room was fun and lively, but at other times it also felt almost sacred. Although there were many moments of group laughter, unlike so many typical gatherings of guys where there is often cross-talk and side jokes, only one person spoke at a time.To get things started, I asked the group: What has surprised you most about fatherhood? (My wife, a skilled facilitator, had suggested it.) The answers were remarkably wide-ranging. My own parents seem to care very little about my children, one dad said. Having a child has made me lose my career ambition, said another.For many of us, as much fun as it can be, being a father is all-consuming and omnipresent, blurring time and space like few other experiences. Some days, especially during those early sleepless nights, its hard to know which end is up. And yet these few hours of conversation every couple of months somehow manage to stay with me. I often find myself reflecting on things other fathers said in our groups, days, weeks or even months after the fact. Others have reported the same.At the end of that first night, one of the other dads asked: How often do you guys have conversations like this, with other guys? Once a week? Once a month? Once a year? After the last prompt, finally a mass of hands started going up.Guys like us, it turns out, are hungry for a place to talk with other men, particularly about how fatherhood is changing us, and changing writ large. Just as literature has long helped people see that our seemingly personal struggles are universal, being able to talk in this group offers a similar revelation. In an age of near-constant superficial virtual connection, theres an enormous benefit in having a real life community to confide in more deeply and provide a genuine social network  especially for men and young fathers so often without it.John Cary is the editor of The Power of Pro Bono and a strategist for TED.Sign up for the Well Family newsletter to get the latest news on parenting, child health and relationships with advice from our experts to help every family live well."}

{"text": "If the dance landscape were a Venn diagram, Reid Bartelme, a dancer turned costume designer who cant seem to stop performing (he has tried), would fill the center space. Mr. Bartelme bridges worlds.With his design partner, Harriet Jung, he has brought a fresh sense of fashion to the dance stage, working with Justin Peck at New York City Ballet and with contemporary choreographers including Jack Ferver, Liz Santoro and Pam Tanowitz. But his contribution to the art form is more valuable than costume design alone.Mr. Bartelme, 35, also bridges two dance worlds: that of uptown (the sometimes rarefied universe of ballet) and downtown (contemporary dance, where conceptual ideas, risk and bare feet are key ingredients). Historically, the two dont intersect much. But Mr. Bartelme is an undeniable link.Hes friends with everyone, Ms. Tanowitz said. He is a trained ballet dancer and also works in downtown dance. His costumes are at New York City Ballet and Abrons and everywhere in between. I think it has to do with his personality, his inclusiveness.Mr. Bartelme, whose mild-mannered elegance is anchored by humor, is responsible for inspiring ballet dancers including David Hallberg, Isabella Boylston and James Whiteside of American Ballet Theater, and many at New York City Ballet, including Mr. Peck, Adrian Danchig-Waring and Gretchen Smith, to broaden their artistic horizons.I wanted my friends in ballet to know more, Mr. Bartelme said in a recent interview. I wanted them to have a broader understanding of what dance means, especially in New York. If I bring Justin to a Beth Gill piece  Ms. Gill is a respected downtown formalist  its because I think that work is going to be really valuable for him to see; and because I admire his work, I want him to have information thats going to help him grow.Mr. Ferver, a writer, director, choreographer and actor, has, under Mr. Bartelmes tutelage, become obsessed with City Ballet. Specifically, he has fallen hard for the choreography of George Balanchine, who died in 1983 but still remains the guiding light of City Ballet, as well as for two dancers: Sara Mearns and Teresa Reichlen.I would never say Im the next thing for ballet, Mr. Ferver said. That would be like someone from the ballet world saying, Im going to write a script because Ive gone to see a lot of plays. Nevertheless, he is trying to choreograph a ballet. In his I Want You to Want Me, which opens at the Kitchen on June 30 as part of the American Dance Institute  he described it as a horror play and goth ballet  the costumes are by Mr. Bartelme, who is also a cast member. His presence as a dancer in the studio has influenced Mr. Ferver to push himself choreographically as he works in the ballet vernacular.Theres a solo for Reid in the beginning of the piece, Mr. Ferver said. I gave him some ballet steps, and he did them and then he said: Its too easy. Youre better than this. You have to think of something better. I love that.Mr. Bartelme grew up in SoHo as a New York music kid. He said it gradually dawned on him that he didnt relate to the theatrical elements of singing and embodying a character. As a voice student in high school at Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan  he first met Mr. Ferver there  he enrolled in a class called General Dance. It was a gym credit, and it was only 45 minutes, and it was my favorite period of the day, he said. I kept taking it over and over until there was a point at which I was like, I am very good at this.Long and lean with flexibility and line, Mr. Bartelme has a natural facility for ballet. He attended SUNY Purchase College briefly but soon realized: If youre going to be a ballet dancer, you go be a ballet dancer.He was accepted into the School of American Ballet at 18 but opted for the school at Pacific Northwest Ballet, where he was in its professional training program before joining BalletMet in Columbus, Ohio, and then the Alberta Ballet in Calgary. After returning to New York, he danced with Shen Wei Dance Arts for two years. His transition to design came through his love of making things, namely Halloween costumes  Mr. Ferver recalled the time Mr. Bartelme went as a pregnant male sea horse  rather than a fascination with fashion.At the Fashion Institute of Technology, where he met Ms. Jung, he found his point of view. My direction was simplicity, he said. I wouldnt say minimalism. He added: I knew I wasnt going to be designing anything super futuristic or uncomfortable or bizarre. I was interested in clothes that were beautiful and comfortable and modern.While still at the institute, he began receiving commissions for costumes from choreographers. Initially, he brought in Ms. Jung only for Mr. Pecks costumes; now they collaborate full-time and have a studio at Abrons Arts Center.Like Mr. Bartelme, Ms. Jung, 31, arrived at the institute with life experience; she had studied visual art and earned a degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in molecular and cell biology. Quickly, she and Mr. Bartelme bonded. A lot of kids get to F.I.T., and they walk into class day one and they look like normal kids, and a month and a half in theyre fully wearing witch outfits because theyre experimenting with whats going to be good for them, Mr. Bartelme said. Harriet and I came in day one in sweatpants and left school in sweatpants.Coming commissions include costumes for dances by Matthew Neenan and Pontus Lidberg, and for Mr. Pecks Scherzo, which is to have its premiere with City Ballet in July at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.Costumes are challenging for many choreographers; who in the dance world does Mr. Bartelme think could most use his design help? I feel like often the companies that need help, I dont want to help that company, Mr. Bartelme said with a chuckle. I feel like a lot of people who get it as dancemakers also often get it aesthetically.Whenever they have a break, and its increasingly uncommon, Mr. Bartelme and Ms. Jung work on developing clothing  simple, wearable  to sell online. They have no aspirations to develop a big brand; dance is their base.Mr. Bartelme said that while he and Ms. Jung love the fashion world, they see the misery and the greed and the insecurity and the pretentiousness. But dance is different. Theres a joy and creativity and lack of pretension, he said. So many fashion people are so overly concerned with their status. I cant get on board. Its too painful."}
{"text": "A man in the Bronx was fatally shot by New York City police officers early Sunday after he refused to drop a gun he was carrying and pointed it at the officers, the authorities said.The police arrived just before 2 a.m. at the Soundview Houses, a New York City Housing Authority complex in the South Bronx, after receiving 911 calls reporting gunfire, the authorities said. The officers encountered the man, 25, holding the gun outside a building on the corner of Randall and Rosedale Avenues, the police said.The man, whose name was not released, walked toward the officers with the gun raised, Assistant Chief Larry W. Nikunen, the police commander for the Bronx, told reporters on Sunday. He pointed the gun at them on two separate times, Chief Nikunen said.The officers, who were in uniform and in plain clothes, ordered the man to drop the weapon, and he did not comply, the police said. Three of the officers opened fire; 31 shots were fired, the police said, and the man was struck several times.The man was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. No officers were injured.A 9-millimeter handgun was recovered by the police at the scene, and Chief Nikunen said investigators had reviewed surveillance-camera footage that appeared to support the officers account of the confrontation.Later on Sunday, the site of the shooting remained cordoned off with crime-scene tape as investigators surveyed the scene and several officers guarded the entrance to one of the buildings, allowing only its residents to go inside.Candles had already been placed on the sidewalk near the corner of Randall and Rosedale Avenues, with Rest in Peace and other messages written on them. They sat just a few yards from a larger cluster of candles, stuffed animals and tequila bottles that served as a memorial for someone else.The shooting had cast a pall over Fathers Day for some in the complex. Anita Oselmoe, who has lived in the Soundview Houses for five years, said people did not feel like doing anything or going anywhere anymore.And many were outraged, saying that the spray of gunfire directed at the man was an overreaction. They dont have no business shooting that baby no 31 times, Ethel Massay, who has lived in the complex for 57 years, said as she walked to the grocery store.Rosie Chisolm, who has lived in the complex for two decades, was sitting on a bench in the courtyard. Shoot him in the leg or something, she said. They shooting to kill.Some residents said they first heard a couple of shots that the man had fired, which prompted the 911 calls and were, according to the authorities, detected by the Police Departments ShotSpotter system, which sent the officers to the location as well. Minutes later, the residents heard more shots; this time, it was the police.I woke up and touched my husbands chest, Violet Levis, 48, said, clutching a balloon for her husband that said I Love You. I looked out the window, and I saw about four or five cops.Ms. Oselmoe was in her apartment when the shooting happened. People were running and ducking for cover, she said. My heart was beating so fast. And hours later, she remained angry. They dont have no respect for us, Ms. Oselmoe said of the police. This is no Fathers Day gift."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Under pressure from Democrats, the Senates Republicans have agreed to allow a series of votes on restricting gun sales in the aftermath of the shooting rampage in Orlando, Fla. Rival measures from Republicans and Democrats to be taken up on Monday seek to address the so-called terror gap allowing people on terrorist watch lists to buy firearms, and to expand background checks for purchases at gun shows and online. Separately, President Obama wants to ban the sale of semiautomatic assault weapons similar to those used in recent attacks, but that issue is not on the Senates agenda.Do any of the measures stand much chance of passage?Probably not. Although Senate Democrats forced votes this time by filibustering for 15 hours beginning Wednesday, and Donald J. Trump has expressed support for stopping people on terror watch lists from buying guns, Republicans voted down similar proposals in December after a shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., killed 14 people. Several moderate Republicans are working on a compromise, but they face an uphill fight because of election-year politics and the threat of opposition from the National Rifle Association for any Republican who breaks from the partys traditional stance.Would a renewed ban on assault weapons have stopped the Orlando gunman from buying the weapon he used in the attack?Possibly. The gunman, Omar Mateen, who had been on a terror watch list until 2014, bought a SIG Sauer MCX rifle  a spinoff of the military-style AR-15  as well as a 9-millimeter handgun at a Florida gun shop about a week before the attack. The original assault weapons ban passed by Congress in 1994 prohibited the sale of 19 kinds of semiautomatic weapons, including AR-15s, AK-47s and Uzis, as well as dozens of types of handguns, ammunition and other rifles that met certain military-style conditions. It is unclear how many of these military-style features were on the AR-15-style rifle that Mr. Mateen used, so it may or may not have fallen under the ban.How did the 1994 assault weapons ban ever get through Congress?President Bill Clinton pushed the ban through as part of a far-reaching, $30 billion crime bill, making it a nonnegotiable element in the face of Republican resistance. Rising crime rates, gang violence and a number of attacks on police officers by criminals using assault rifles all helped get the ban through Congress. When he ran for re-election, Mr. Clinton released an ad saying, Bill Clinton did something no president has ever been able to accomplish: He passed and signed a tough law to ban deadly assault weapons.Was the assault weapons ban effective?There is dispute about its impact to this day. Some academics credit the ban with keeping tens of thousands of dangerous assault weapons off the streets beginning in 1994 and contributing to a drop in violent crime. At the same time, many types of high-powered weapons fell outside the ban, including knockoffs, older versions and altered rifles that filled the void. A study financed by the Justice Department said the effectiveness in reducing crime was mixed from city to city.What happened to the 1994 assault weapons ban?In 2004, Congress allowed the 10-year ban to expire amid lobbying by the N.R.A. and gun-rights advocates in Congress. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president that year, accused President George W. Bush of failing to do enough to win passage of an extension.Have there been efforts to bring back the ban?Yes, the large majority of the most notorious recent mass shootings in the United States  including the attacks in San Bernardino; Newtown, Conn.; and Aurora, Colo.  have involved semiautomatic weapons. After almost every one, there has been an effort in Congress to bring back the ban. But all have failed in the face of Republican opposition. The N.R.A. and other gun-rights advocates argue that the weapons should not be called assault rifles at all, and that they are usually used for hunting, marksmanship or self-protection. Some Democrats believe the passage of the 1994 ban contributed to the Republican takeover of the House that year, and the memory of that political impact has been sobering for gun-control advocates."}

{"text": "MADRID  Europe is facing a migration crisis, the threat of Islamic terrorism and the prospect that Britain will exit the European Union. But the big foreign policy issue before Spains national elections next Sunday? Venezuela, of course.Candidates have visited Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to grandstand. Spains governing conservative party has met in Madrid with opponents of Venezuelas leftist government. There have been charges of a virtual Venezuelan infiltration of Spains politics.The shadow cast by Venezuela has been so long that its president, Nicols Maduro, recently invited Spains politicians to hold their election debate in Caracas so that I can also participate, and perhaps I will win the elections in Spain.It may seem a little odd, given the host of problems facing Spain. But the reason is simple. After six months of political deadlock and inconclusive elections in December, the only sign of change before Spains election redo is the growing strength of Podemos, the far-left party whose leaders once served as advisers to the former government of Hugo Chvez in Venezuela.The stronger Podemos looks, the more its opponents try to link the party to Venezuela, where the economy is collapsing and Mr. Maduros increasingly authoritarian government has declared a state of emergency. The message is meant to be scary and clear: Venezuela is a mess, and it can happen here.One of the four parties that is competing in the campaign in Spain was hosted and formed in Venezuela, so if they want to bring that model here, they have to explain why, Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, an emerging center-right party, told a group of foreign correspondents this month, shortly after returning from Venezuela. It is Podemos which brought Venezuela to Spain, not us.The leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, fired back in a televised debate that his opponents were ignoring the issues that could really affect Spain, starting with a possible British exit from the European Union.Podemos had its first electoral success in May 2014, when it won 8 percent of the votes in European Parliament elections. In its early days, Podemos looked to Syriza, the Greek party that came to power in early 2015, as an example of how a new and far-left party could overhaul the political establishment.Podemos may be poised to do just that. After recently forming an alliance with a radical party, United Left, it could now leapfrog over the Socialists into second place, behind the conservative Popular Party of the caretaker prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, according to recent opinion polls. Such an outcome would overturn the two-party political order that has prevailed since Spains return to democracy in the late 1970s.Given the troubles in Greece, which is negotiating yet another international bailout, opponents of Podemos have made much of the connection to Syriza. But it is the link to the former Chvez government that has been a special focus.A handful of Podemos leaders  including Mr. Iglesias, Juan Carlos Monedero and Iigo Errejn  once used their academic credentials as political scientists to work as advisers to the government of Mr. Chvez, who died in 2013. They also did advisory work in Bolivia and Ecuador, while studying how far-left politics could reshape Latin American nations.Opponents of Podemos have attacked the party over its finances and possible links to foreign governments, particularly Venezuela. Such accusations have been rejected by Podemos, which has instead built part of its campaign on denouncing the corruption of established parties financed by construction kickbacks.Before Podemos entered the Spanish political scene, Mr. Iglesias and Mr. Errejn sat on the board of a Spanish research institute financed by the Venezuelan government.In April 2015, Mr. Monedero resigned from the leadership of Podemos amid ideological differences, but also after he had to pay 200,000 euros (about $227,000 under the current exchange rate) in back taxes and fines for receiving 425,000 as payment for consulting with the Chvez government in 2010 to develop plans for a new regional currency.Mr. Monedero and other Podemos leaders were never charged with wrongdoing. However, during the recent televised debate, Mr. Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, repeated previous allegations that Podemos had relied on Venezuelas money.It is immoral that a foreign regime finances a party, Mr. Rivera said. A visibly angry Mr. Iglesias responded that it was a very serious offense to accuse his party of illegal financing, particularly since it was an issue that had been already cleared by Spains Supreme Court.Mr. Rivera has recently issued the strongest statements over Venezuela during the Spanish election campaign, taking over from Mr. Rajoy, who last month convened his security council to review the safety of the 200,000 Spaniards living under the state of emergency in Venezuela.With the help of Spains conservative establishment, the Venezuelan opposition has also made its presence felt in Spain, led by Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo Lpez, a Venezuelan politician who was jailed in February 2014.This month, Ms. Tintori, a former television presenter, gave public speeches in Salamanca and Madrid, hosted by the Popular Party as well as a conservative newspaper, La Razn.Two years and three months ago, we came to Spain and other countries and nobody paid attention to us, she said before an audience that included three ministers from Mr. Rajoys government, as well as Mr. Rivera.Even as Podemos has distanced itself from Venezuela, it has not joined other parties in condemning Mr. Maduros policies. This month, the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding the release of Mr. Lpez and other political prisoners in Venezuela.The lawmakers of Podemos abstained, while those of its ally, the United Left party, voted against the resolution, arguing that it was designed to further destabilize Venezuela.Podemos is making economic proposals clearly similar to those of Venezuela, Francisco de la Torre Daz, an economic adviser to Ciudadanos, said.Among those proposals, he said, is the idea that it would be worth getting out of the euro. He also mentioned that Podemos advocates a massive increase in public spending, as well as a plan to nationalize some strategic corporations.Mr. Iglesias has denied having any plan to drop the euro, dismissing warnings by Mr. Rivera and others as fallacious scaremongering.Podemos has gradually watered down its demands for an economic overhaul. Its latest party program seeks an increase in public spending of 60 billion, less than its previous proposal of 96 billion.Despite this, some conservative associations have recently been formed to help prevent Podemos from turning Spain into the next Venezuela.We want to denounce the situation in Venezuela and warn about what could happen in Spain, said Andrs Redondo, the president of an association called Let Us Save Democracy, which was formed in Madrid last year.We want Venezuelans to share their experience with Spaniards, he said, so as to make voters here, particularly the young, wake up and realize that all the terrible things happening there are now happening here."}
{"text": "In 2014, Melissa Padilla, an immigrant from Mexico, was dismayed to find while doing research for a paper at Dartmouth College that all articles about undocumented students were archived under the heading illegal aliens. When she led a group of students to ask the college library to consider phasing out the term, they expected, at best, to make a statement at the campus. But their request triggered a political fight that has drawn in lawmakers engaged in the immigration debate.Dartmouth librarians told the students that indexing terms were set by the Library of Congress, but agreed to raise their concern with the American Library Association.In January, the association passed a resolution calling on the Library of Congress to drop the subject heading illegal aliens and replace it with undocumented immigrants. In March, the librarys officials said they intended to replace illegal aliens with two new terms: noncitizens and unauthorized immigration.The library changes or eliminates thousands of subject headings each year as language, meaning and connotations evolve. The term Negro, for instance, was retired as a subject heading in 1975; insane was abandoned in 2007 and replaced with mentally ill.In April, Representative Diane Black, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced a bill called the Stopping Partisan Policy at the Library of Congress Act. It demanded that the library retain the terms alien and illegal immigrant as subject headings. My constituents know that illegal immigration by any other name is still illegal, and we should identify it as such, Ms. Black said in a statement. A version of her bill was later added as a provision in the appropriations bill for the legislative branch, which includes the Library of Congress.In May, four other Republican lawmakers, including Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, wrote a letter to the library urging it not to change the terms. They accused the library of bowing to the political pressure of the moment.On June 9, as House members were debating the appropriations bill, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida, urged her colleagues to vote down the provision. The suggestion that in the 21st century, the term illegal alien is an appropriate one, is similar to suggesting that we continue to use the term Negro, she said.Congress has never sought to control the librarys subject headings, noted Representative Joaqun Castro, who has introduced legislation to remove the terms alien and illegal immigrant from federal code.These folks may not be American citizens, but they are not people from outer space. They are human beings, Mr. Castro, a Democrat from Texas, said in testimony before a House committee. When ugly, belittling terms are used to describe groups of people, those terms can make discrimination seem O.K.Despite the Democrats efforts, the amendment seeking to retain the term made it into the House appropriations bill. The Senate version does not include a similar provision. When the bills are reconciled in the coming weeks, lawmakers should consider if fighting to preserve an anachronistic and offensive term is worthwhile."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump on Sunday renewed his call for the United States to consider profiling as a preventive tactic against terrorism in the aftermath of the mass shooting last week in Orlando, Fla.I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in an interview on CBSs Face the Nation.Mr. Trump issued a similar call in December after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., which left 14 people dead and more than 20 injured.On Sunday, he also sought to downplay any differences between his positions on gun control and those of the National Rifle Association. Last week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that people on the governments terrorist watch list should be barred from buying firearms, a stance that contradicts that of the N.R.A.But Mr. Trump seems to be backtracking, saying on ABCs This Week that he understands exactly the N.R.A.s objections to restricting access to people on the watch list.A lot of people are on the list that really maybe shouldnt be on the list, and their rights are being taken away, he said.The N.R.A. used the Sunday morning political shows to criticize, and even to mock, Democratic efforts to pass new gun control laws after the Orlando shooting.Wayne LaPierre, the groups executive vice president, said on Face the Nation that legislation was effectively useless at preventing terrorist attacks.These bad guys were facing, they dont say: Oh gosh, they passed a law. Oh gosh, I dont think I could do it, Mr. LaPierre said.Democrats made their own push for expanded gun control  which the Senate is to take up Monday  and more broadly, for a grass-roots effort to take on opponents of stricter gun control.Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who led a 15-hour marathon of speeches on the Senate floor that ended early Thursday, said on ABC that the only way that you win this issue is by building a political infrastructure around the country that rivals that of the gun lobby. Mr. Trumps presumptive Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, expressed her support for the effort, writing Stand strong @ChrisMurphyCT on Twitter.Profiling has been an occasional theme of the Trump campaign. In addition to his most recent comments, Mr. Trump has discussed increased surveillance of Muslims and mosques, and has said that he would consider registering Muslims in a special database or requiring that they carry cards that identify them as Muslim."}
{"text": "OAKLAND, Calif.  To try to pick the inflection point in this spectacular and deciding game of the N.B.A. finals, to lay a wager on which arcing shot, improbable steal or rebound would turn this game, was to ensure youd go flat broke.There were 20 lead changes and 11 ties, waves of emotion surging through the arena and the teams like electrical pulses.With just under two minutes left in the game and the score tied at 89-89, the Cavaliers Kyrie Irving missed a spinning drive, and the Warriors were off to the races. The sore-backed Andre Iguodala passed to Stephen Curry, who flipped it back to Iguodala, who went up for the layup.Or not, as the case would be.Sprinting five or six steps behind was that 6-foot-8 Erie Lackawanna freight train known as LeBron James. His strides got longer and faster, and now he was airborne, his eyes nearly even with the hoop. He blocked the shot, his hand pinning the ball to the backboard.For a moment, players on both teams paused, as if not sure, in their game intensity, of what they had just seen.In the next minute, Irving, a spinning top of a guard, hit a fall-back-baby 3-pointer in the face of Curry, and that was more or less that, aside from a free throw tacked on by James to make the score 93-89 with 10 seconds remaining.After a futile Warriors possession, the horn sounded, and the reigning champions, who held the single-season record for wins, were dethroned. James fell to his knees and covered his eyes.Jamess performance in this series was overwhelming. He was the first player to lead both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks not only in the N.B.A. finals but in any postseason series of any length, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Two summers ago, he had returned to Cleveland, a wayward son grown sated on the humid languor of South Beach. He had also made that most dangerous of vows, promising to bring a championship to his hometown.The self-imposed pressure became fathoms deep. The Warriors most often play with a loose-limbed intelligence and joy, channeling the jazz of Americas beautiful game. James and his mates often play no less astutely but as if consumed, aware that no end suffices save victory. At games end, James, J. R. Smith and their coach, Tyronn Lue, sobbed without shame.I never cry; Ive always been tough and never cried, Lue said. A lot of emotions just built up.To watch the players before the game was to sense that cord of tension. The Warriors tried to keep their cool-cat vibe. Asked about his game day ritual, Coach Steve Kerr replied that he and his assistant coach Luke Walton had done hot yoga.Im guessing Bill Belichick and his staff dont do that, Kerr said, smiling. Just throwing that out there.Curry, in his warm-up ritual, is usually bubbly. On Sunday, his face was stone impassive. When the time came for the national anthem, the Warriors restlessly swayed from foot to foot.On the other side, LeBron James stood still as a statue. He is 31 years old, a long remove from the man-child who came into the league 13 years ago. He had reached six previous championship series and come away the winner twice. Last years loss to the Warriors left him near broken. As the anthem played, he said, he thought of the task at hand, how great the Warriors were, how important it was for his team to keep its head.Then he acknowledged another thought, as he peered intently about the darkened arena.Just living in the moment, he said. I told my guys before the game: Listen, there is a game to be played, but theres not many guys, theres not many teams, that get an opportunity to be in the N.B.A. finals in a Game 7. Theres just not.Dont take it for granted.One of sports fascinations is to watch as a young man or woman comes to full and introspective flower. James is the son of a single mother from a tough corner of a tough city. He is a star, an on-court coach, and he speaks about police and gun violence. In different circumstances, had he not been blessed with preternatural ability and drive, we very likely would not have known of talents that have nothing to do with hitting a fall-back 3-point shot.What a shame that would have been.Kyrie Irving is 24, with a valise full of ankle-breaking moves. He reportedly chafed at the intensity of playing with these Cavaliers. He had his moment of clarity Sunday. He spoke of his good luck to spend his formative N.B.A. years playing with an impresario.I watched Beethoven tonight, Irving said. I watched LeBron James compose a game.He shook his head, chuckling at the absurdity of it, amazed that James had a triple-double in Game 7 of an N.B.A. final: 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.Irving got at what so many miss when they complain that James does not commandeer games like a Michael Jordan or a Kobe Bryant. James has a point guards temperament; he will spend quarters orchestrating, trying to get his team to play as one.I cant do it by myself, so that was my mind-set, James said. Like Jay Z said, youve got to stay low and keep firing.So it was in the first two quarters as James pitched the ball to Kevin Love, the power forward who can seem uncomfortable in his playing skin. Love was wide open at the 3-point line, yet he missed each shot. By games end, however, he had pulled down many rebounds. In the fourth quarter, Love spun into the lane and hit a sweet push shot.He did so off a pass from James.He protects every single one of us, Love said.The Warriors go into the books as having collapsed on the cusp of victory, up by three games to one. That narrative is flawed, not least because they played a fine last game. All season, they dispatched opponents in a hail of precision passing and 3-point shooting.In the first quarter, Irving hounded Curry beyond the 3-point line. So Curry dipped beneath him and put up that most improbable of shots, a teardrop 3-pointer.It slapped through the net.Yet Curry and Klay Thompson struggled with their shooting. And Curry made some unaccountably sloppy plays, like a behind-the-back fourth-quarter pass that sailed out of bounds rather than into Thompsons hands. Afterward, he was in no mood, after nine months of playing, to cut himself a break.It is extremely hard to win a championship, he said. Thats why you pour Champagne on yourself.Draymond Green played like a man possessed. He drained six 3s, and in the absence of the teams injured center, Andrew Bogut, he was often the center. He is just 6-7 and 230 pounds, but he was like a knight on the parapets, swinging his mace at all comers.Yet he lives with the knowledge that his Game 5 suspension in the finals might have been the turning point, as his team lost a home game it expected to win.James walked into the postgame news conference wearing a cut-down net like a necklace. His two boys took seats at either side of him; he carried his toddler daughter, Zhuri, in his arms and kissed her between each question and answer.He spoke of the sorrowful history that is Clevelands sports legacy, rattling off the lowlights like any fan, if a tiny bit inaccurately (John Elways drive was 98 yards).You could look back to the Earnest Byner fumble, Elway going 99 yards, to Jose Mesa not being able to close out in the bottom of the ninth, to the Cavs went to the finals  I was on that team  in 2007, us getting swept, he said, adding, For us to be able to end this, to end this drought  our fans deserve it.Jamess sense of history extends to his sport. On the riser, he handed the championship trophy to a teammate and set off to find the great Boston Celtics center Bill Russell, for whom the Most Valuable Player Award of the N.B.A. finals is named. James gave Russell, the snowy-haired old shot blocker, a long hug.Later, as cleaning crews moved through Oracle Arena and the press emptied into the parking lot, James stood in the Cavaliers locker room, a cigar in one hand, a bottle of Champagne in the other. He was loose and funny, and he looked younger than he had in years. He regaled teammates with tales of past championship games, and he chased his daughter, who darted like a rabbit about the boxes in the room.He posed for a last photo. Then he put up that big hand that had made that flying block: Enough.I got to shower, he said. We got to get back to Cleveland. Were going home."}
{"text": "HOUSTON  Venezuela had a plan. It was a tactical approach, designed specifically to take Lionel Messi and the other dangerous Argentine attackers out of the game by applying forward pressure and forcing Argentina to make long, hopeful passes.And it worked for about seven minutes.But in the eighth minute, Messi conjured the kind of technical genius that compels most observers to call him the best soccer player in the world, artfully lifting a perfect pass about 15 yards in to Gonzalo Higuan. With one striking touch, Higuan converted it into a goal, the first in Argentinas 4-1 victory on Saturday in a Copa Amrica Centenario quarterfinal.In that decisive moment, like so many others experienced by opponents hoping to stop Messi, all of Venezuelas carefully conceived defensive tactics were laid to waste.They have that stroke of genius that changes all your schemes, Venezuela Coach Rafael Dudamel said. They had an incredible pass from Messi, and they scored.Messi has frequently had brilliant strokes like that one, and now it is the United States turn to try to find a way to suppress them. The United States earned a spot in Tuesdays Copa Amrica semifinal here at NRG Stadium by beating Ecuador, but the dubious prize awaiting them is Messi, Argentinas mesmerizing, 5-foot-7 dribbling, passing and shooting virtuoso.This is special, United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. Absolutely, its special to play against these type of players. When you get the opportunity to play against one of the biggest players in the world, you want to raise your game; you want to enjoy it.The United States has had few chances to play a meaningful game against a star of Messis caliber who also played on such a quality team. (FIFA has Argentina ranked No. 1 in the world.) Tuesdays match will be the rough equivalent of taking on Pels Brazil in 1970 or Ferenc Puskass Hungary in 1954 or the team led by that other Argentine soccer genius, Diego Maradona, in 1986.As Klinsmann noted, the United States was seconds from beating Portugal at the 2014 World Cup until Cristiano Ronaldo  who has at times been considered Messis equal  provided a gorgeous cross that enabled Portugal to tie the game.Over the years, the United States has faced the likes of Englands Wayne Rooney at the 2010 World Cup, Brazils Ronaldinho at the 1999 Confederations Cup and Italys Paolo Maldini, one of the best left backs in history, at the 1990 World Cup, as well as Brazils duo of Bebeto and Romrio and Romanias Gheorghe Hagi, some of the top players of their era, at the 1994 World Cup.At the 1934 World Cup, the United States lost by 7-1 to Italy, and one of the goals was scored by Giuseppe Meazza, whom some historians consider the best player Italy has produced. At the 1998 World Cup, Klinsmann scored against the United States toward the end of his prolific career as one of the most dangerous attackers for the world champions West Germany and Germany.But in recent memory, there is nothing that quite resembles Tuesdays challenge. Two years ago Ronaldo did not enjoy the kind of team support from Portugal that Messi does now with Javier Mascherano, ngel Di Mara (when healthy), Sergio Agero and particularly Higuan, Argentinas penetrating No. 9, who scored twice against Venezuela.Spend too much time focusing on either Messi or Higuan, and the other could act decisively.We have two strikers who are really exceptional, Gerardo Martino, Argentinas coach, said after Saturdays match. I cannot repeat it enough; I really feel this. People in Argentina have a hard time accepting the quality of soccer players that we have. We have two No. 9s, and we proceed with what we feel is best.Martino watched Venezuela hack down Messi several times in the quarterfinal game and said the United States would certainly use every possible means to stop him.I just hope that every possible way is a legal way, he said at a news conference Monday.As superb as Messi is, some believe that he will not have achieved his true potential until he wins a major trophy for Argentina, just as he has numerous times for the club team Barcelona. But after tying Gabriel Batistutas record of 54 international goals for Argentina on Saturday, Messi said he felt no pressure.Im always going to be in there, Messi said. Im very calm.In Maradonas time, Argentina also had strong supporting players like Claudio Caniggia, Jorge Valdano, Jorge Burruchaga and later Batistuta. But like Messi, Maradona was the teams clear supremo.When the United States beat Argentina, 3-0, at the 1995 Copa Amrica, Maradona was no longer playing for his country. But Klinsmann had the chance to play against Maradona several times. In the 1990 World Cup, West Germany beat Maradonas Argentina, 1-0, in a dismal final in Rome.You are talking about two wonderful players, the best in the world in their time, Klinsmann said, referring to Maradona and Messi. Its now Messis time, and when I had the opportunity to play many games against Maradona, it was Maradonas time. We all admire these players. But there are also ways to stop them. I am not the type of person who pulls out old stories and tells the players how we did it. Thats not me, but there are ways to play against these wonderful players.Klinsmann showed his team video scouting reports of Messi and Argentina and said his players needed to give 10 to 15 percent more in order to achieve an upset Tuesday. But the Argentines are not infallible, he added. They have not won a major tournament in over 20 years, and Messis team has come up short twice in the last two years. Germany beat La Albiceleste, as Argentina is known, in the final of the 2014 World Cup, and Chile won in the final of last years Copa Amrica.Both times, it took champions to beat Messi and Argentina.You guys are probably worrying more about Messi than we are, the United States captain, Michael Bradley, told reporters.

He was 69.The cause was lung cancer, his son, Timothy, said.Mr. Fuller had been The Tribunes editorial page editor, executive editor, publisher and chief executive. He was president of Tribune Publishing, the newspaper division of the Tribune Company, when he oversaw the purchase that brought The Los Angeles Times, Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant and other Times Mirror publications under the Tribune umbrella, in what was described as the largest acquisition in newspaper history.He retired and left the board in 2004 before the investor Sam Zell bought the company, took it private, imposed cost cuts and later filed for bankruptcy protection.Mr. Fuller was editorial page editor from 1981 to 1987. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for his commentary on constitutional and legal issues.In one editorial, he wrote that for a person who has been accused and cleared of a crime, Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese shows a remarkable disinterest in the laws traditional presumption of innocence. (Mr. Meese was investigated in the Iran-contra arms deal and a Mideast pipeline negotiation, but was never prosecuted.)There is plenty of room for disagreement about the legal rule requiring police to read a suspect his rights or lose the chance to use a confession against him, the editorial continued. A lot of people are uncomfortable with letting defendants go free simply because the police fouled up an interrogation or a search. On balance, this newspaper has not been persuaded that any other device can deter police misconduct; it has supported the so-called Miranda rule, despite misgivings about its consequences in certain cases.Jack William Fuller was born on Oct. 12, 1946, in Chicago, the son of Ernest Fuller, a financial reporter and assistant editor at The Tribune, and the former Dorothy Voss Tegge. He worked at the paper as a copy boy while still in high school.My father was a newspaperman, and so the fact is I had grown up with it, he once explained.Jack Fuller earned a bachelors degree in journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 1968. After serving in the Army as a Vietnam correspondent for the newspaper Pacific Stars and Stripes, he attended Yale University Law School, graduating in 1973. (At Yale he was a classmate of Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham and Robert Reich, who became the secretary of labor in President Clintons administration.)His marriage to the former Alyce Tuttle ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Katherine Ryan, and his second wife, Debra Moskovits.Mr. Fuller was hired as a general assignment reporter by The Tribune in 1973 and left in 1975 to become a special assistant to the United States attorney general, Edward H. Levi, a former president of the University of Chicago. Mr. Levi was credited with restoring the Justice Departments credibility after Watergate.Mr. Fuller rejoined the newspaper in 1977 as a Washington correspondent. He was named executive editor in 1987, vice president and editor in 1989, publisher in 1994 and president in 1997.Ann Marie Lipinski, the curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard and a former editor of The Tribune under Mr. Fuller, praised him for making the newspaper and later Tribune Company healthy environments for women.Mr. Fuller published seven well-received novels on topics ranging from multigenerational tales of Middle America to computer hackers and jazz. Among them are his first, Convergence (1982), involving espionage and the C.I.A.; Fragments (1984), a Vietnam War novel (a moving account of the war that purveys more than information  it gives the war a literary form, The New York Times Book Review said); and The Best of Jackson Payne (2000), about a jazz musician with echoes of John Coltrane. (Beginning in the late 1980s, Mr. Fuller wrote frequently about jazz for The Tribune.)Another novel, One From Without, published this month, is drawn from personal experience: It is about an executive trying to save a public company on the brink of disaster.He also wrote News Values: Ideas for an Information Age (1996) and What Is Happening to News: The Information Explosion and the Crisis in Journalism (2010).In 2005, Mr. Fuller was named to the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which is based in Chicago. Marjorie Scardino, the foundations chairwoman, said on Tuesday that he had driven its grantmaking agenda on global conservation, sustainable development and climate change.Mr. Fuller, she said, insisted that there is not traditional journalism and new media, only good journalism and bad journalism.In What Is Happening to News, Mr. Fuller wrote that the Times Mirror purchase was an attempt to compete with the internet on a national scale. He acknowledged that the effort to meld different news media cultures had been difficult, but added that the Tribune Companys creation of a nationwide web-based classified business had been more successful.Still, competition with online news sites for advertisers and readers, coupled with a business downturn, prompted chief executives at the Tribune Company and other corporate parents to demand even more draconian economies. Rather than impose them, Mr. Fuller, among other editors and publishers, quit.What has happened since I left haunts me, he wrote. Every newspaper company, even those led by people totally committed to striking a proper balance between the financial and social missions of journalism, has been beaten down.Time and again, he continued, people arguing about the future of news have made the distinction between what people want to know and what they need to know. If concentrating on what people want to know means succumbing to direct democratic rule of the sort you can find on the internet, it is a retreat too far. It abandons the social mission in order to serve it.He added, Fulfilling the social purpose of journalism requires us to give people what they need to know."}
{"text": "United States lawmakers are demanding answers from the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global regulator of doping in Olympic sports, in the wake of a New York Times investigation that found that the agency mishandled multiple warnings about Russia  including a 2012 appeal from a Russian Olympian who confessed to cheating, pleaded for help and offered to cooperate with the agency.On Monday morning, Senator John Thune  Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over sports  sent a seven-page letter to the agency, which is partly funded by United States taxpayers. The letter asked the agencys president to explain why it had taken years to investigate claims of a government-run doping program in Russia and called for further inquiries into possible cheating.Citing the more than $25 million the United States contributed in the last 14 years, Mr. Thune criticized the agency for letting at least four years pass before pursuing tips from Russian whistle-blowers, and for containing its ultimate investigation to Russian track and field in spite of claims that cheating transcended sports and implicated other countries.These recent allegations, and WADAs subsequent response, have called the organizations strength and credibility into question, Mr. Thune wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times. A spokesman for the committee confirmed the letter had been sent Monday morning.Mr. Thunes letter came on the same day that the agency held an antidoping symposium in London. A WADA spokesman did not respond to an emailed request for comment.The Times investigation found that the agency was hampered by politics and possible conflicts of interest such that it did not initiate inquiries and, in one case, forwarded a whistle-blowers email to Russian sports officials  the very people the athlete said were running a doping program.Some WADA officials have defended their handling of the allegations, asserting that until 2015, when a new code took effect, the agency had no responsibility to conduct investigations. Beyond that, some at WADA said, they feared jeopardizing whistle-blowers safety.But Mr. Thune disputed those explanations, citing the agencys broad authority to investigate since 2004, six years before it received the first known whistle-blower tip. He said officials concerns for the personal safety of whistle-blowers only raised questions about whether the regulator had proper policies in place to solicit information and protect people from retaliation.WADAs excuse for its long delay in aggressively investigating these allegations, he wrote, overlooks the fact that the evidence WADA received from the whistle-blowers centered on allegations of corruption at the WADA-accredited antidoping laboratory in Moscow and at the Russian national antidoping agency, both of which are under WADAs direct oversight.One of the watchdogs principal duties is to monitor testing laboratories and national antidoping organizations like those in Russia.On behalf of the Senate committee, Mr. Thune called for WADA to broaden its investigation into systemic doping, going beyond track and field, the Sochi Games and Russia. He called for WADA to look back further than the 2014 Winter Olympics, noting that the committees own research had suggested Russias doping program dated back as far as three decades.Russias longtime antidoping lab director, Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the Olympic laboratory at the 2014 Sochi Games, said he surreptitiously substituted the tainted urine of at least 15 top Russian athletes on steroids who won medals at those Games. Though his lab was under investigation by WADA, the agency cleared Dr. Rodchenkov to direct testing weeks before the Olympics.Last month, WADA commissioned an investigation into Dr. Rodchenkovs specific claims about Sochi, and it is due to conclude by July 15.But, Mr. Thune said, WADAs scrutiny should not end there, and the claims of Dr. Rodchenkov, who fled Russia and is living in Los Angeles, have certainly ranged far wider.The Senate committee requested answers to 11 specific questions  five of them focused on potential conflicts of interest among WADAs leadership  by July 5.WADAs decision-making body is composed of government and Olympic representatives, an arrangement that presents possible conflicts because Olympic officials might not be inclined to reveal doping transgressions that could mar the integrity of the Games, while government officials might be more inclined to protect athletes from their own countries.Mr. Thune questioned the allegiances of Craig Reedie, WADAs president, who is also a vice president of the International Olympic Committee and the person to whom Mr. Thunes letter was addressed.WADAs mission to promote doping-free sport may be undermined since its leadership has ties to national Olympic committees or sports ministries whose goal is to increase a particular nations competitiveness and medal counts, Mr. Thune wrote. A truly independent WADA is essential to the I.O.C.s mission to demonstrate credibility on the world stage.Global sports officials have hustled ahead of the Rio Olympics, which start on Aug. 5, to assure athletes of a level playing field.Investigations have become the flavor of the month, Mr. Reedie said in an interview in Switzerland this month.As for which athletes will be cleared to compete in the Games, WADA defers to the governing bodies for specific sports. Thats their problem, Mr. Reedie said. Im one of the few people who doesnt wake up in the morning and think only about Rio.Last week, the International Association of Athletics Federations barred Russias track and field team from competing in the Rio Games. At that announcement, in Vienna, Rune Andersen, a former WADA director who is monitoring Russias reforms on behalf of global sports officials, defended the worlds watchdog.WADA is now dealing with this in a very strict fashion, Mr. Andersen said. WADA, national antidoping organizations and government need to step up their fight against doping."}

Britons vote in a referendum on the matter on Thursday.The British pound rose sharply, and investors dumped ultrasafe assets like American government bonds, gold and utility stocks, sending those prices lower. Machinery and consumer companies jumped, and energy companies rose with the price of oil.Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, said Britains status in the E.U. would not affect American businesses much, though it could hurt European banks. Investors, he said, were worried about what would happen to the union if Britain did leave. Its not the direct effects that people are worried about, its the indirect ones, he said.The Standard & Poors 500-stock index rose 12.03 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,083.25. The Nasdaq composite gained 36.88 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,837.21.

{"text": "The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government  or thats how it works in theory, anyway.In practice, though, court decisions over several decades have created so many exceptions to this constitutional principle as to render it effectively meaningless in many real-world situations.On Monday, the Supreme Court further weakened the Fourth Amendment by making it even easier for law enforcement to evade its requirement that stops be based on reasonable suspicion. The justices ruled 5 to 3 that a police officers illegal stop of a man on the street did not prevent evidence obtained from a search connected to that stop to be used against him.The case, Utah v. Strieff, started when the police in Salt Lake City got an anonymous tip of drug activity at a house. An officer monitoring the house became suspicious at the number of people he saw entering and leaving. When one of those people, Edward Strieff, left to walk to a nearby convenience store, the officer stopped him and asked for his identification. A routine check revealed that Mr. Strieff had an outstanding small traffic warrant. The officer arrested him based on that earlier warrant, searched him and found drugs in his pockets.The State of Utah agreed that the initial stop was illegal, because it was not based on reasonable, individual suspicion that Mr. Strieff was doing anything wrong. Instead, the state argued that the discovery of the valid warrant  after the illegal stop  got around the Fourth amendment violation.The Utah Supreme Court rightly rejected this argument, but that decision was overturned in a majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas. The officers lack of any specific suspicion of Mr. Strieff, Justice Thomas wrote, was a result of good-faith mistakes. The illegal stop was, at worst, an isolated instance of negligence.In a powerful dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor took apart that specious reasoning. Do not be soothed by the opinions technical language, she wrote. This case allows the police to stop you on the street, demand your identification, and check it for outstanding traffic warrants  even if you are doing nothing wrong.Justice Sotomayor acknowledged the temptation to let the officer get away with his own wrongdoing, since his instincts, although unconstitutional, were correct. But that misses a basic principle of the Fourth Amendment, she said: Two wrongs dont make a right.Responding to Justice Thomass unsupported claim that the violation of Mr. Strieffs rights was an isolated case, Justice Sotomayor pointed out that the police in Salt Lake City and nationwide routinely run warrant checks on people they have illegally stopped. Combine that practice with the staggering number of outstanding warrants  nearly eight million around the country, almost all for minor offenses  and cops have an even greater incentive to stop anyone for any reason, knowing the odds are good that they will find a warrant and be able to make an arrest and conduct a search.In a final and more personal statement, Justice Sotomayor drew a link between the courts extreme deference to law enforcement officials and the racial inequity that pervades Americas criminal justice system. While Mr. Strieff is white, she said, it is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny. The central, disturbing message of Mondays ruling, she added, is that whether you are white or black, your body is subject to invasion while courts excuse the violation of your rights, and in that way, unlawful police stops corrode all our civil liberties and threaten all our lives."}
{"text": "An electronic display on the treadmill in my local gym reminds me Im not only running on the machine, but out of time. Its graph comparing changes in the runners heart rate to that of peers goes no further than age 70. Im 85, and find it ominous that the machine presumes that anyone that old shouldnt be on the thing.Reminders that Im now officially one of the old-old appear with greater frequency. Some are subtle, like the treadmill display; others are more jarring, like my daughters approaching 60th birthday. Most reminders are well-meaning: a young woman offering her seat on a bus, an airport employee hurrying over with a wheelchair, happily telling me I wont have to walk to the gate or stand in line. I graciously decline their kindness, struggling not to protest, But, Im a competitive runner! That I feel robust doesnt matter; the man I see and the man they see are two very different people.I recently read something the philosopher Montaigne wrote over 400 years ago: The shorter my possession of life, the deeper and fuller I must make it. His words inspired me to seek a path through old age without surrendering to it or ignoring its reality.I began by fighting memory lapses. Rather than substituting whatever for an elusive word, I now strain to recall that word, even if means asking others to bear with me for a bit. I avoid phrases that suggest the end of things, like downsizing or I no longer do that. I subscribe to internet memory games. To recapture the excitement I felt in long-ago classrooms, I began rereading books I read in college.I also decided to reach out to men my age to learn how they navigate through growing old. Like most of the men I began speaking with, Im a product of the 1950s and its pressure to conform, to avoid risk, to shun anything that marked one as different. Many young people then were warned by parents that signing petitions bearing words like protest or progressive would get them rejected for a job or fired when they grew up. Men in my platoon didnt embrace when we parted after serving in the Korean War. Closer than brothers, we settled for a handshake, knowing thats what men did.Almost immediately, I found conversations with men my age awkward. Attempts I made to discuss aging were met with jokes about the alternative. With few exceptions, those I spoke with regarded feelings as something to be endured, not discussed. It quickly became clear I was free to contemplate growing old, but not with them.My wife suggested I meet with younger acquaintances to learn if they would talk with me about aging. I did, and found that men just 10 years younger spoke openly about changes in their minds and bodies. No one joked or changed the subject when one of them confided, My father had Alzheimers, and Im beginning to forget the same things he did, or, My firms managing partner said I was slowing younger associates and had to retire.It puzzled me that they felt so much freer to discuss feelings than men born just a decade earlier. Could it be because they were shaped by the 60s, rather than the 50s? Growing up, they protested what we accepted, challenged authority we obeyed, celebrated their individuality while we hoped to be one of the men in a gray flannel suit. They were the me generation, defined by Woodstock and rock n roll, while my generation found comfort in Eisenhowers paternal leadership and listening to soothing ballads like George Shearings Ill Remember April and Margaret Whitings Moonlight in Vermont. Separated by a sliver of time, the two decades seem an eternity apart.As I seek to reinvent myself, questioning what I do out of habit and what Im not doing that could be liberating, its the voices of these younger men that I hear as I run on the treadmill today. That and the voice of Frank Sinatra from the 50s, crooning a line from September Song that captures what Ive been feeling: But the days grow short when you reach September. Its realizing that Ive reached November that presses me forward, ignoring the treadmills display, hoping I can lead a deeper and fuller life before I run out of time.Robert W.

{"text": "On Monday, the Supreme Court decided to not take up Second Amendment challenges to laws in Connecticut and New York that ban the sale or possession of many semiautomatic assault rifles and large-capacity magazines in those states.With those  denials, the latest of more than 70 rejections of challenges to gun regulations, the justices have made it clear that reasonable gun-control laws are fully consistent with Second Amendment rights.Yet Congress has refused time and again to help protect Americans from rampant gun violence, and so it has fallen on state lawmakers to address this national crisis. Some state and local governments have banned or restricted certain types of ammunition, or prohibited classes of people, like those convicted of multiple instances of drunken driving, from possessing guns. Others have imposed universal background checks and safe-storage requirements on gun owners.These are all good efforts, but a patchwork solution is not enough. Anyone who cannot buy a gun in one state can simply drive to the next to find looser laws. The Orlando massacre only made clearer the need for national legislation. Yet in a familiar scene on Monday, four separate measures in the Senate  to block people with suspected terrorist ties from buying guns and to close loopholes in background check laws  were defeated.On Tuesday, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, introduced a bipartisan bill that would give the attorney general the authority to bar gun sales to people on either of two watch lists  the no-fly list and the selectee list, which includes those who are subject to extra security screening before boarding a plane. About 2,700 Americans are on these lists. The bill would also alert the F.B.I. of any attempted gun purchase by someone who has been listed on the broader terrorist watch list in the past five years  as the Orlando killer was. Those who believed they had been wrongly denied a gun could appeal directly to a federal court. Senator Collinss bill would be one small step forward on a long road.This does not need to be so difficult. By strong and sometimes overwhelming majorities, Americans  including gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association  support stronger gun laws, including universal background checks, preventing suspected terrorists from buying guns and limiting magazine capacities.Only by taking action on measures like these can members of Congress show that they care more about the wishes of their constituents than of the gun lobby."}

{"text": "Have we been here before? I know  it feels as if the internet, virtual reality, Donald Trump, Facebook, sequencing of the human genome and machines that can reason better than people constitute a change in the pace of change without precedent. But weve actually been through an extraordinarily rapid transition like this before in history  a transition we can learn a lot from.Ian Goldin, director of the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University, and Chris Kutarna, also of Oxford Martin, have just published a book  Age of Discovery: Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Our New Renaissance  about lessons we can draw from the period 1450 to 1550, known as the Age of Discovery. It was when the world made a series of great leaps forward, propelled by da Vinci, Michelangelo, Copernicus and Columbus, that produced the Renaissance and reshaped science, education, manufacturing, communications, politics and geopolitics.Gutenbergs printing press provided the trigger, Goldin told me by email, by flipping knowledge production and exchange from tight scarcity to radical abundance. Before that, the Catholic Churches monopolized knowledge, with their handwritten Latin manuscripts locked up in monasteries. The Gutenberg press democratized information, and provided the incentive to be literate. Within 50 years, not only had scribes lost their jobs, but the Catholic Churchs millennia-old monopoly of power had been torn apart as the printing of Martin Luthers sermons ignited a century of religious wars.Meanwhile, Goldin added, Copernicus upended the prevailing God-given notions of heaven and earth by finding that far from the sun revolving around the earth, the earth rotated around the sun, and voyages of discovery by Columbus, da Gama and Magellan tore up millennia-old maps of the known world.Those were the mother of all disruptions and led to the parallels with today.Now, like then, new media have democratized information exchange, amplifying the voices of those who feel they have been injured in the upheaval, said Goldin. Now, like then, public leaders and public institutions have failed to keep up with rapid change, and popular trust has been deeply eroded. Now, like then, this is the best moment in history to be alive  human health, literacy, aggregate wealth and education are flourishing  and there are more scientists alive today than in all previous generations.And, yet many people feel worse off.Because, as in the Renaissance, key anchors in peoples lives  like the workplace and community  are being fundamentally dislocated. The pace of technological change is outstripping the average persons ability to adapt. Now, like then, said Goldin, sizable parts of the population found their skills were no longer needed, or they lived in places left behind, so inequality grew. At the same time, new planetary scale systems of commerce and information exchange led to immense improvements in choices and accelerating innovations which made some people fabulously rich.Was there a Donald Trump back then?Michelangelo and Machiavellis Florence suffered a shocking popular power-taking when Girolamo Savonarola, a midlevel friar from Ferrara, who lived from 1452 to 1498, exploded from obscurity in the 1490s to enthrall Florentines, who felt left behind economically or culturally, with sermons that laid blame upon the misguided policies and moral corruption of their leaders, said Goldin. He and his zealous supporters, though a small minority, swept away the Medici establishment and seized control of the citys councils.From there, Savonarola launched an ugly campaign of public purification, introducing radical laws including against homosexuality, and attacked public intellectuals in an act of intimidation that history still remembers as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Savonarola was amongst the first to tap into the information revolution of the time, and while others produced long sermons and treatises, Savonarola disseminated short pamphlets, in what may be thought of as the equivalent of political tweets.The establishment politicians of the day, who were low energy, underestimated the power of that new information revolution to move beyond scientific and cultural ideas to amplify populist voices challenging authority.Yikes! How do we blunt that?More risk-taking is required when things change more rapidly, both for workers who have to change jobs and for businesses who have to constantly innovate to stay ahead, Goldin argued. Governments job is to strengthen the safety nets and infrastructure so individuals and companies can be as daring  in terms of learning, adapting and investing in themselves  as they need to be. At the same time, when the world gets this tightly woven, America needs to be more, not less, engaged, with the rest of the world, because the threats posed by climate change, pandemics, cyberattacks or terror will not be reduced by America withdrawing.Then, as now, walls stopped working. Cannons and gunpowder came to Europe that could penetrate or go over walls and books could bring ideas around them, he said. Then, like now, walls only made you poorer, dumber and more insecure."}
{"text": "Ros is the hardest wine to make well, said Sacha Lichine, who is perhaps the most prominent ros winemaker in the world. But, he added, smiling, it is the easiest to sell.It wasnt always that way. Mr. Lichine, who owns Chteau dEsclans in Provence and is credited with making a strong contribution to the robust growth of ross, was in New York a few months ago for tastings and visits to some of the restaurants he supplies. Wearing one of his 20 signature pink shirts, he remembered the time before the ros craze.In 2008, he said, when he was getting started, he sold just 3,500 cases of the ros made on his estate. Now, hes selling more than 200,000 cases, 50,000 of them in New York alone. Owners of prestige wineries in Bordeaux, Burgundy and elsewhere are making ross; some are flocking to Provence to snap up wineries.In Paris today, ros is bigger than white wine, Mr. Lichine said. I think the potential in the United States for ros is just getting started.The total market for ros wine in the United States increased by 56.4 percent last year over 2014. Ross from Provence, considered some of the best, accounted for more than half the total.But back in the beginning, Mr. Lichine said, he was simply looking to do something different.I thought about making dry, elegant ross, and theyve turned out to be the new wave, he said. I wanted to make a difference in the industry.He sold Chteau Prieur-Lichine, the fourth-growth estate he had inherited from his father, the esteemed winery owner and writer Alexis Lichine, and decamped from Margaux to Provence and Chteau dEsclans.What distinguishes todays ross from the often-candied blush bottles of the past, he said, is finesse. They are light yet floral, he said, with some richness, and the paler the better, a style that has conferred prestige.A popular ros de Provence, Chteau Pigoudet, is nearly colorless; it could be mistaken for white wine. Theres even a California ros called Summer Water.But tint is no indication of flavor.This month in the village of Gordes in Provence, I conducted a tasting of eight ross from the region for participants on a New York Times trip to Provence. We sampled the wines blind and rated them. They ranged from barely blushing to petal pink, and from bland to floral and fruity. That Chteau Pigoudet was the favorite, preferred for its scent of jasmine and citrusy richness. Maison Saint Aix, showing a delicate color but big and spicy on the palate, also did well.Many of these wines seduce with alluring bouquets of fraises des bois, tart blood orange and cherry blossoms before giving way to lean delicacy with an underpinning of complexity on the palate.When Mr. Lichine was in New York, he sipped his top-of-the-line Garrus and said, I couldnt make a ros like this 25 years ago. He credits new technology, advanced sorting equipment that allows the pale fruit to be separated from the dark skins faster, and conditions that prevent oxidation.His portfolio of ros wines, Garrus, Les Clans, Rock Angel and Whispering Angel, some in dramatic, oversize bottles, range in price from around $10 to more than $100.He was quick to point out that sparkling ros Champagne has long been accepted by connoisseurs, usually demands high prices and is suitable all year. Why not still wine? he asked."}

{"text": "Is Europe finished?The latest polls and political prediction markets this week suggest that Britons will vote on Thursday to stay in the European Union. The Leave campaign, led by Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who tried to whip up a surge of resentment against immigrants into a vote for Britain to leave the bloc, looks set to fail.But even if the pro-European Remain cause pulls out a victory, the popular hostility against the decades-long process of European integration  evident not only in Britain but across the Continent  underscores a defining weakness. Europe itself lacks a firm democratic foundation.Europes leaders face a clear-cut choice: For their integration agenda to succeed  preserving the free movement of people within the bloc, forging ahead with the euro and the single market, keeping doors open to outsiders  the E.U. must figure out how to overcome the narrow national interests and mistrust that tie it up in knots every time a collective response is needed.That will require democracy on a European scale. If Europes national governments remain unwilling to cede political power to regional institutions that have democratic legitimacy, the European Union will slide backward.We need pan-E.U. politics, argued Mary Kaldor, professor of global governance at the London School of Economics. I dont know how we get there.For all the complaints about the Brussels fudge factory, the discontent in Britain on Thursday probably will have little to do directly with Europes institutional shortcomings. This is about frustration of the working class about a long period of deindustrialization, Professor Kaldor said. Mr. Johnson is Britains Donald Trump. Europe is a stand-in for globalization.Popular discontent with globalization in its many forms has been building up in the West for many years now, said Kevin ORourke, an economic historian at the University of Oxford. We are seeing its effects everywhere.Still, the European Unions hapless response to its current social and economic challenges has made it an easy target. With no real European institutions of democratic accountability  the European Parliament serves little more than a decorative function  the only way voters can express their dissatisfaction is by pushing to leave and by supporting extremist political movements.In many countries the perception is that national governments are powerless and that there is nothing at the European level to address problems, said Paul De Grauwe, a former Belgian member of Parliament now at the London School of Economics. Both Europe and national governments lose legitimacy.What could the E.U. have done better? Things would be a lot easier if most of Europe were growing at more than a snails pace. The inability of countries in the euro area  which does not include Britain  to stop the slow-motion implosion of Greece and other deeply indebted countries gives integration a bad name. The two are related.Germanys resistance to share in the costs of a collective solution to seriously write down the debts that Greece and other Southern European nations will never be able to pay off  insisting instead that the indebted countries and their beleaguered citizens bear nearly all the cost  has prolonged and deepened Europes stagnation.Britons contemplate the crisis of the euro as a little bit of proof that they were right not to join, said Giancarlo Corsetti, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Cambridge.Britons have more control over immigration than the Leave campaign would have them believe. Refugee policies are decided in London. And it was the Labour government of Tony Blair that chose not to take advantage of a seven-year phase-in period to limit the entry of citizens of new members from Eastern Europe. Many of the Polish plumbers that so inflamed the British populace  showed up because Britain  unlike, say, Germany  chose to let them in straight away.Immigration, however, can easily be deployed as an argument to leave the rest of Europe. More than half the 333,000 immigrants who arrived in Britain last year were E.U. citizens, free to be there as a matter of right under European law.The Leave campaign made an argument that the only way to reduce this part of immigration is to leave the E.U., noted Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an expert on immigration at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. And they struck a chord with the electorate.Dealing with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war will never be easy. But Europes reaction was notoriously unproductive. The E.U.s institutions again appeared irrelevant, as governments retrenched into their corners and failed to devise a collective, burden-sharing approach.In May, a group of European scholars proposed a set of collective financing mechanisms to reduce debt burdens along the E.U.s periphery and to pay for a European Union-wide refugee policy. Their report concluded: The sovereign debt and refugee crises prove that Europe has failed to design institutions that are robust enough to weather difficult times.How much integration do Europeans need? Dani Rodrik at Harvards Kennedy School of Government notes that the E.U.s initial major goal  preventing France and Germany from drawing the world into another war  has been achieved. It also served as a democratic, capitalistic anchor for Eastern European countries to hang onto after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.But today Europes integration effort has lost sight of its political and social dimensions, he argues, narrowing into a raw effort to reduce market barriers. Thats not enough to inspire popular support.There might be areas where collective action at the European level could make a difference  as a counterweight to colossal multinational companies that can challenge the authority of individual nations, or to prevent capital from effortlessly zipping across borders in an effort to avoid taxes. Indeed, the E.U. has taken a leading role confronting the worlds most daunting collective action problem: climate change.An aging Europe is going to need more immigrants. Smart collective strategies would surely help the Continent deal with what are likely to be decades of intense migration from the many poor countries in its extended neighborhood.The critical question is whether Europe will be able to achieve the kind of integrated decision-making needed to address these challenges. So far, it hasnt shown it can rise to the occasion. There is not much appetite for further political integration, Mr. Corsetti said. Solutions to Europes challenges must navigate around this constraint.The free movement of people inside the E.U. might be the first to go into reverse. Restricting the free movement of labor is not a taboo, Mr. Kirkegaard told me. Another way freedom of movement will be restricted is you will see more and more restrictions placed on the ability of citizens from other E.U. countries to claim welfare benefits.Maybe the European Unions future is more  la carte  a set of coalitions of the willing, as it were. Rather than insisting on all or nothing, said Richard Haass, president of the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, it might be better to consider a Europe that is not one size fits all, where the balance between national governments and Brussels is more flexible.This may come as a disappointment to Europes current leaders. But one way or another, the projects governance must come into line with what its people want. Thats called democracy.Europe must either roll back the economic integration or roll ahead the political integration, Mr. Haass said, so people feel they have a say over the politicians who are driving changes that affect their lives."}
{"text": "LIKE many Americans, I am still haunted by images from the last days of the United States withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975. Newscasts showed South Vietnamese desperately trying to scale the walls of our embassy in Saigon to board the last helicopter flights out of the country. The fear in their eyes was chilling. Many of these Vietnamese had assisted the American mission. As the North Vietnamese advanced on the city, these people knew that they faced a harsh fate if they were left behind.For the last three years, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and I have been trying to prevent history from repeating itself, this time in Afghanistan.Since the American-led invasion in 2001, our service members and diplomats have relied on thousands of Afghans, particularly as interpreters. These are brave men and women who put themselves and their families at risk to help American officials and troops accomplish their missions and return home safely. Implicit in their willingness to help the United States is an agreement that theyll be protected.The State Departments Special Immigrant Visa program allows these Afghans to seek refuge in the United States. These visas are reserved for men and women who undergo rigorous screening and can demonstrate at least two years of faithful and valuable service to the United States.Yet while nearly 10,000 Afghans are still trying to obtain special visas, Congress is on course to abruptly end the program.Last week, the Senate followed the House in passing a defense bill that discontinues the program. That means that the State Department will most likely run out of visas, which have provided an escape route for more than 9,000 Afghans and their immediate families, by the end of the year.In previous years, Senator McCain and I succeeded in persuading our Senate colleagues to provide more visas. But this year has been different: Weve heard objections to the cost and questions about why the additional visas were necessary. A compromise was eventually reached that would have provided an additional 2,500 visas, but it was blocked by just one senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who held the amendment hostage to get a vote on an unrelated issue. That brought our efforts to a dead halt: There will be no extension of the visa program in the annual defense authorization bill.The threat to these Afghans is all too real. Because of their service to our country, they and their families are being hunted down by the Taliban. Some interpreters have been killed and wounded while waiting for an American visa. Many are scared to leave their homes, shop in open markets or take their children to school. Some have experienced the unimaginable horror of having family members murdered because of their association with our government.Abandoning these Afghans would not just be a stain on our national honor, but also would carry profound strategic costs. United States forces have always relied on local allies to accomplish military and diplomatic missions, and will need this support in the future. But why would anyone agree to help the United States if we have a record of breaking our promises and abandoning those who assist us? Understandably, our military leaders  past and present  are very concerned.The former commander of United States forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and his predecessor, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, have sent urgent pleas to Congress. Our current commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson, has warned congressional leadership that breaking our promise could have grave consequences for these individuals and bolster the propaganda of our enemies.There is still an opportunity to keep the program alive. The Senate will soon consider legislation to fund the State Department, and as a member of the subcommittee that will write this bill, I will do my best to see that it extends the visa program.By renewing this program, Congress has an opportunity to send a potent message to the world that we will not let fear and prejudice prevent us from staying true to our nations principles and promises. By protecting our Afghan friends from reprisals, and welcoming them into our American family, we can assert that the United States is still a great and good country  and that we do not abandon those who risked their lives to serve with us."}
{"text": "Officials at the Transportation Security Administration thought they had the solution for long lines at airports: PreCheck, a program that allowed people to move through security without taking off their shoes or removing electronics from their luggage.It has not worked as planned.Customers who apply for the program, which requires a fee of $85 and a background check, say they continue to face long waits to obtain the PreCheck clearance. Such delays could grow worse because the number of people signing up for PreCheck has more than tripled in the last few months, climbing to 16,000 a day on average in May, agency officials said.That surge has led to long delays in processing applications. Dozens of passengers who have recently tried to sign up for PreCheck say they have been given appointments for the in-person interviews needed to complete the process that are weeks or even months away.Vance Hiner of St. Louis said he was put on a three-month waiting list at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport to complete his enrollment.The process of looking at my face and verifying that my passport and drivers license match could be done by literally any security-cleared airport staffer, he said in an email.Roger Golliver of Beaverton, Ore., a suburb of Portland, said his wife signed up for the PreCheck program in March. But she had to wait months for an interview.The earliest she could find was a July date in Seattle, he said. Seattle is about a three-hour drive from Portland.Officials at the T.S.A. and MorphoTrust USA, the company that handles all PreCheck applications, say they are aware of the problems and are working to increase the number of enrollment centers while hiring additional people to deal with the surge in applications.We are adding as much capacity as quickly as possible, said John Sammon, the chief marketing officer for the T.S.A.Charles Carroll, senior vice president for identity services at MorphoTrust, said the company was hiring additional staff to bolster its efforts at the 14 biggest airports, including in New York and Chicago, where 450 passengers at Chicago OHare International Airport missed their flights last month because of long lines.Were in emergency response mode, Mr. Carroll said. T.S.A. was caught off guard by the size and amount of people traveling.The agency has made some improvements in reducing wait times at airports. It has increased overtime for screeners and moved dozens of bomb-sniffing dog teams to larger airports from smaller ones. On the busy Memorial Day weekend, few travelers reported a long wait.More help is on the way. This year, Congress allowed the agency to use $34 million to hire nearly 800 new screeners. And lawmakers recently approved an additional $28 million that will allow the agency to convert 2,784 screeners from part time to full time, which will add 53 security lanes at the nations airports.Some members of Congress and many in the travel industry wonder if the efforts will be sustainable throughout the peak of summer travel. T.S.A. cannot continue to rely on temporary Band-Aids by moving around limited Homeland Security dollars, said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi.John S. Pistole, the former T.S.A. administrator who started the PreCheck program, argued that using risk-based intelligence to screen and move low-risk passengers through security checkpoints was a better way to protect airports. Information provided by those who sign up for PreCheck is checked against the F.B.I.s criminal history databases as well as several terrorist screening databases and no-fly lists.The initial challenge was the reverse of today: The T.S.A. could not persuade enough people to sign up for PreCheck, and at many airports the PreCheck lanes were empty as regular security lines backed up.So the agency started a program called managed inclusion, which allowed people who had not signed up for the program to go through expedited screening when regular lines grew long.An investigation by the Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Inspector General found that screeners allowed investigators with fake bombs and weapons to pass through checkpoints in 95 percent of the tests, a finding first reported by ABC News last year.Peter V. Neffenger, who took over the agency last July, ended the practice of managed inclusion. But fixing that problem has contributed to the long security lines that the agency is now trying to solve.On Wednesday, Kelly Hoggan, who had been the assistant administrator for the Office of Security Operations for the T.S.A. since 2013, resigned. Mr. Hoggan had been reassigned in May after a backlash over long security lines at airports and congressional scrutiny of thousands of dollars in bonuses he had received.Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, is trying to enlist help from the private sector to persuade more people to sign up for PreCheck. In a letter to the 100 largest American companies, he asked that they reimburse employees for signing up for expedited screening programs.The agency is also seeking additional vendors, in addition to MorphoTrust, to help process PreCheck enrollment. Still, it is unclear if those efforts will be enough to reduce the long lines expected at airports this summer."}
{"text": "With the arrival of summer, critics and reporters for The New York Times spread throughout the city on Tuesday to take in some of the more than a thousand free concerts that are part of Make Music New York.I rubbed my eyes when I arrived at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden on Tuesday. Not because I was sleepy  though, yes, it was a little before five in the morning. What I couldnt make sense of was the crowd that had assembled in an orderly line outside the entrance. A hundred people at least.We had all risen early for Inside the Bird Chorus, an improvised performance led by the jazz clarinetist David Rothenberg that was the first of the days Make Music New York concerts.The resident vocal ensemble, including robins, catbirds, thrushes and sparrows, was already in full-throated song when the audience settled on the grass in an orchard dotted with cherry and nectarine trees. The instrumentalists  Mr. Rothenberg, as well as the cellist Hank Roberts, the electric guitarist Charlie Rauh, and Lucie Vitkova on accordion and other instruments  joined in almost bashfully, in muted fits and flutters. Now and then, Mr. Rothenberg sent volleys of jazzy riffs skyward, but more often the group produced mildly dissonant chords, rhythmic shudders and breathy whispers.The music had neither the ecstatic attentiveness of Messiaens bird transcriptions nor the elegant mimicry of Beethoven or Mahler. But as an excuse to lean against a Sargent cherry tree and listen to the citys birds celebrate the breaking dawn, it was quite lovely. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIMA row of strollers was parked in the shade. A woman stood next to me, sketching in a book. A girl fussed next to her, peering at the drawing, wondering what it was. A mother on a bench nursed a baby, the childs ears protected by headphones.They needed to be protected from Shimmer, a crashing and often tedious piece for massed cymbals, composed and directed by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer, Brian Chase. At the northern end of a roasting Madison Square Park, beneath the statue of David Glasgow Farragut, 16 cymbalists, arranged in groups of four, tapped out rhythms amplified to a roar over speakers that couldnt cope, or pinged quietly, sticks striking right at the center of the discs.As music, it was best when each player improvised as part of a foursome; as a musical statement, the thrashing final crescendo obliterated the city sounds around it, as if to say that the music was here and would not be quieted. DAVID ALLENFour grand pianos nestled together in front of the Cornelia Street Cafe in Greenwich Village on Tuesday afternoon presented quite a sight. Passers-by and those enjoying lunch under a canopy must have assumed they were about to experience some serious piano power.But the pianists Hitomi Honda and Karl Larson, who organized the program, selected works that explored subtleties of piano color and subdued sonorities, starting with John Cages undulant, exotic Mysterious Adventure for prepared piano, played captivatingly by Adam Tendler. The wondrously subdued sounds silenced many, who listened closely even as street bustle and chirping birds blended in.During the first half of this four-hour marathon, which included works by Morton Feldman, David Lang and others, I especially enjoyed Philip Glasss hard-driving, austere Music in Fifths performed here by four pianists playing two pianos (with Vicky Chow joining her three colleagues) and Earle Browns complex, pointillist Fourmore, a solo work incisively played by Ms. Honda. ANTHONY TOMMASINIThe plaza at the World Trade Center, with its elegant Sept. 11 memorial and imposing transit hub, represents both a respectful acknowledgment of the past and a confident step into the future. So its only fitting that the Make Music New York performance there featured the adventurous PUBLIQuartet playing quintessential New York songs rearranged by high schoolers.The diverse group of student arrangers was mostly drawn from Face the Music, a youth new-music program. Jonah Murphy twisted the tourist trap of Bernsteins New York, New York, adding stray fragments of melodies and ominous chords, while Zachary Detrick brought warm, immersive textures to Carly Simons Let the River Run. Emily DeLia converted the unshakable uplift of Jay Zs Empire State of Mind into genial dialogue and frenetic energy: The theme was passed back and forth among the strings, racing from major to minor, through tempos and keys, seemingly from the Bronx to Battery. ANDREW R. CHOWDuring concerts in outdoor spaces, music often has to compete with urban din. But all extraneous noise was blocked by the loud, joyous sounds produced by a small procession of Highland bagpipers and bass woodwinds holding court in Long Island City.The piece they played, Windchime, was the brainchild of three composer-performers, including the bagpiper Matthew Welch. After filing into Court Square together, the musicians dispersed throughout the small park, playing notes arranged to coincide with areas of the space. At various points, the trills, tremolos, dynamic swells and flickers of melody that emerged over the steady drone of the bagpipes meshed into colorful surges that did indeed evoke wind chimes. At the conclusion of the work, watched by construction and office workers lunching in the park, the participants gathered by the fountain to play Amazing Grace. VIVIEN SCHWEITZERThe guerrillas converged on Castle Clinton in Battery Park in four columns. I spotted an advance detail of one tuba and two trumpets, but they proceeded in isolation, as if unwilling to acknowledge one another, and the sputtering sounds they produced were, at first, swallowed up in the afternoon traffic noise and the swirls of Tchaikovsky wafting out of the SeaGlass Carousel.The players were members of TILT Brass, and they were about to rendezvous with Iktus Percussion for a performance of Guerrilla Fanfare, a work by the composer Kevin James that uses spatial and processional elements in a kind of asymmetric warfare, pitting music against the indifferent city roar.Eventually, a group of 16 brass players assembled in loose formation, backed by four percussionists. Individual sounds coalesced into stately fanfares, jiggered by outbursts of Caribbean rhythms. They were conducted by Mr. James, perched on top of a step ladder and wearing orange winter gloves. The gleaming, finely balanced harmonies drew a sizable crowd away from the T-shirt vendors and stalls selling Statue of Liberty hats and selfie sticks. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIMMake Music New York chose to shine a bright spotlight on extraordinarily talented youth on Tuesday. Or rather, a bright setting sun, in the open air of Pier I in Riverside Park at a concert presented in collaboration with Summer on the Hudson.Focused solely on Philip Glasss 20 tudes for piano, it featured  along with the composer himself, in a star turn  40 youngsters, most seeming of high school age, each playing one tude in two cycles of the full work. A few clinkers aside, most of the performances were more than competent, if somewhat studied.And a few were remarkably fine: Theodore Rockas in a bravura account of the tude No. 6 and Asia Hickman in a beautifully shaped version of No. 7 in the first cycle; and Ella Kronman and Sabina Marra, sensitive and lyrical in Nos. 16 and 17 the second time around.

{"text": "Bill Richmond, who collaborated with Jerry Lewis on the screenplays for The Ladies Man, The Nutty Professor and a half-dozen other Lewis films before establishing a successful television career writing for Carol Burnett and others, died on June 4 at his home in Calabasas, Calif. He was 94.His death was confirmed this week by his wife, Saria Kraft.Mr. Richmond was working as a jazz drummer with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra in 1959, backing Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas, when Mr. Lewis, attending one of the shows, came backstage and introduced himself.We became almost instant friends, Mr. Richmond told Written By magazine in 2011. In the first place, I truly thought he was funny. Not in his act necessarily, but being around him  really funny in a way that I think is funny.Mr. Lewis hired his new friend to be the drummer for his stage band and then, sensing their comic rapport, asked him to collaborate on the screenplay for The Ladies Man. The film was a hit, and Mr. Richmond went on to share screenwriting credits with Mr. Lewis on The Errand Boy (1961), The Nutty Professor (1963), The Patsy (1964), The Family Jewels (1965) and The Big Mouth (1967).His role, as he described it, was to set the stage for Mr. Lewis to ad-lib and indulge in physical comedy. Youre creating for a guy who started out as a dumb act with this little record player playing in clubs  he couldnt talk, couldnt tell jokes, all he could do is be silly and pratfalls, Mr. Richmond told Written By. I realized Im not going to write funny dialogue, but Im going to try and put him in that situation.Mr. Richmond later made a smooth transition to television, first as a monologue writer for Rowan and Martins Laugh-In and later, most notably, for The Carol Burnett Show, where he and his fellow writers won three Emmy Awards. I had a sketch on every single show for the five years that I wrote for it, he told the blog TV Store Online in 2015.William Earle Richmond was born on Dec. 19, 1921, in Central City, Ky. His father, Leon, was a station agent for the Illinois Central Railroad in Eastview, Ky. His mother, the former Mary Elizabeth Ragland, was a homemaker.A transfer by the railroad sent the family to Rockford, Ill., when Bill was 5. There, after hearing Benny Goodman on the radio, he joined the junior high school band and was handed a pair of drumsticks.He attended the University of Illinois but left to enlist in the Marine Corps during World War II. He was trained as a fighter pilot and served in stateside posts.After being discharged from the Marines, he headed to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career. I wasnt very good, but I could keep pretty good time and could look like I knew what I was doing, he told The New York Times in 2012. In a few months I actually got a job in a downtown bar and in due time was playing in a big band.In 1947 he married Diana Jannotta, who died in 1993. His second wife, the former Lorraine Sevre, died in 2007. In addition to Ms. Kraft, he is survived by two sons, Bill and Stephen; two daughters, Darlene McMullin and Melanie Klibanoff; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.Mr. Richmond toured with Harry James, Les Brown and Ray Anthony in the 1950s and, when not on the road, picked up work wherever he could find it. He was the rehearsal drummer for Shirley MacLaine. He played on the soundtrack of The Lady and the Tramp. In Los Angeles he sat in with the trumpeter Chet Baker at the nightclub the Haig, was the house drummer at Strip City, where Lenny Bruce performed.With the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, he played on several of Sinatras albums, notably Only the Lonely and Come Dance With Me, and on Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Song Book.The invitation from Mr. Lewis came at a time when Mr. Richmond was growing tired of the music business and feeling threatened by the domination of rock n roll, which he despised. He now had a foot in the door of the film business.After about six months of working together I found myself wanting to make him laugh, and he was making me laugh hysterically, he told TV Store Online. Wed tell each other jokes all the time, and it went from there.For The Ladies Man, in which Mr. Lewiss character works at a genteel womens boardinghouse, Mr. Richmond drew on his experience dating a woman who lived at the Hollywood Studio Club, a dormitory for young actresses. Id write something, then hed look it over, and then hed write a few lines, or hed take what I had written and hed go off and work on it on his own or vice versa, he told TV Store Online.He was a writer on Mr. Lewiss two television variety shows in the 1960s, and reconnected with him in the 1980s to co-write Cracking Up (originally released as Smorgasbord), Mr. Lewiss last movie as a director.After The Carol Burnett Show went off the air in 1978, Mr. Richmond kept busy writing for sitcoms, including Threes Company, Welcome Back, Kotter, The John Larroquette Show and Blossom.His greatest accomplishment may have been his ability to manage his relationship with the notoriously temperamental Mr. Lewis.Hes arguably my best friend, Mr. Richmond told Written By. He not only made me a writer but handed me a career.On the other hand, he told TV Store Online, All I had to do was say one wrong thing to him, and I couldve been out of there."}
{"text": "On Wednesday, Donald Trump gave a meandering, fact-challenged speech  read from a teleprompter, no less  that framed him and the Republican Party as champions of Americas women and racial, ethnic and L.G.B.T. minorities. I laughed out loud, repeatedly.Trump continues to make the incredible claim that his religion-based anti-Muslim policies on immigration and refugees would be good for members of the L.G.B.T. communities because many of those people come from countries with brutally anti-gay records.As Trump put it: I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.What? Not only has Trump never specified a values-based exemption to his Muslim ban, but also how on earth would a values test be administered? And where is the specific proof that Clinton explicitly wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death?Who is buying that nonsense? I know, I know, a disturbingly large percentage of the electorate, but still: This is just a string of lies stitched together with a silver thread.At another point, Trump said that Clinton took millions from countries that pushed oppressive Shariah law or otherwise horribly abuse women and the L.G.B.T. citizens while not disclosing that, as CNN reported last week:[Trump], too, has financial ties to some of the same companies. From licensing his name to a golf club in Dubai to leasing his suburban New York estate to former Libyan strongman Muammar el-Gaddafi, Trump has launched several new business ventures connected to Middle Eastern countries since 2000.This man gives new meaning to the word hypocrisy.But he didnt stop there. He also framed himself as the best candidate for African-Americans (a group he once said he hated counting his money) and Hispanics (even though he has labeled many Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals).Trump said of Clinton:She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders for the United States. The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. Theyre also the ones she will hurt the most, by far.He continued:She cant claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage earners to compete against them.This is the epitome of the politics of public division that seeks to pit one part of the electorate against the other, a way of making starving dogs fight for scraps. Its revolting and un-American  not only the liberal vision of America, but also the conservative vision of America as articulated by Paul Ryan in 2011 when he was hammering President Obama for engaging in what he thought was class warfare.At the time, Ryan told The Heritage Foundation:The perfection of our Union, especially our commitment to equality of opportunity, has been a story of constant striving to live up to our Founding principles. This is what Abraham Lincoln meant when he said, In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free  honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. Ryan continued:The American Idea is not tried in times of prosperity. Instead, it is tested when times are tough: when the pie is shrinking, when businesses are closing, and when workers are losing their jobs. Those are the times when Americas commitment to equality of opportunity is called into question. Thats when the temptation to exploit fear and envy returns  when many in Washington use the politics of division to evade responsibility for their failures and to advance their own narrow political interests.Who is now exploiting fear and envy, Speaker Ryan? Oh yeah, the man youve endorsed.The question that ABCs George Stephanopoulos asked Ryan earlier this month still lingers in search of a sufficient answer:Youve said, in explaining why youre standing by your endorsement of Mr. Trump, what matters more to you than anything are our core principles. But what core principle is more important to the party of Lincoln than stepping up against racism?Trump ended his specious speech with a string of baseless boasts about all the fairy-tale, utopian improvements that a Trump presidency would somehow magically induce. One of those boasts was that inner cities  invariably a term of art in American politics for poor minority neighborhoods  which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt.Again, what on earth does rebuilt mean? Never mind. It wasnt supposed to mean anything specific, or have any policy substance, but rather simply to sound positive and impressive.Trumps speech was garbage, pure and simple. Not only was it too often false, it was also flimsy, an effort to paint himself as a champion of the people who loathe him most.Maybe the people who support him despise Clinton more than they cherish the truth, but for those who can see this mans naked bigotry for what it is, this speech fell like seeds on a stony place. Nothing will come of it."}
{"text": "For two decades, Congress has effectively blocked federal money from being used for basic research on gun violence and its effect on public health. All efforts to lift this restriction have been repeatedly rejected by Republicans who seem to believe that the less people know about gun violence and how to prevent it, the better.California lawmakers, faced with this failure by the federal government, are moving ahead to finance public research on their own. The Legislature voted last Thursday to allocate $5 million for a new center devoted to gun violence research. The center, which will be located on a University of California campus to be chosen by university officials, will study gun crime with an eye toward helping legislators develop policies to reduce it.The measure, first proposed by State Senator Lois Wolk, is included in a budget bill, which Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign.Because of restrictions on federal funding, little is known about the effectiveness of many violence prevention efforts, or about risk factors for committing gun violence. Some states lack even basic data, like an accurate count of how many residents have guns.Nonetheless, the research that has been done has proved useful. A 2001 study by the violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis, School of Medicine suggested that Californias ban on sales of handguns to people convicted of violent misdemeanors reduced their likelihood of committing a future firearm crime or other violent offense. Other states are now considering similar laws. Researchers at U.C. Davis have also found that buying a handgun is associated with an increased risk of suicide, and that restricting gun access among people with a history of alcohol abuse would be likely to reduce violence.California legislators cited the Davis program as a model for the new center. Garen Wintemute, a physician who directs that program, suggested that the new center could study why Californias rate of firearm deaths has dropped by about 20 percent over the last 15 years, while the national rate has remained largely unchanged. Researchers arent sure whether Californias drop is a result of state gun-safety laws, economic factors or something else.Californias move offers a good example for other states, which will have to take the lead on this issue, since any federal action on gun research is unlikely without a change in the makeup of Congress."}
{"text": "Sitting in a classroom at Georgetown Medical School usually reserved for committee meetings, we begin by reading an Emily Dickinson poem about the isolating power of sadness:I measure every Grief I meet\nWith narrow, probing, eyes \nI wonder if It weighs like Mine \nOr has an Easier size.Its a strange sight: me, a surgical resident, reading poetry to 30 medical students late on a Tuesday night. Some of us are in scrubs, others in jeans; there are no white coats. Over the past four years, as the leader of the group, this has become my routine.The students are here after long days in class and on the wards because they have discovered that medical education is changing them in ways that are unsettling. I remember that uneasiness well. My own medical education began with anatomy lab. The first day with the cadaver was unnerving, but after the first week the radio was blaring as we methodically dissected the anonymous body before us.Two years later, on my first clinical rotation, I discovered that it does not take long to acclimate to the cries of patients as I hurried past their rooms, eager not to fall behind in a setting where work must be done quickly and efficiently. This practiced detachment feels necessary, a form of emotional and physical self-preservation. But with little time to slow down, ignoring our own thoughts and feelings quickly hardens into a habit.During my first year in medical school, I found myself gravitating toward my old comfort zone  literature. As an English major, I had grown accustomed to the company of books and was feeling their absence now that Don Quixote had been displaced by Netters Atlas of Human Anatomy. I could look to Netter for concrete answers, but I needed Cervantes to help me formulate questions I had trouble pinning down, like why it was so easy to ignore the dead (and later, living) bodies around me? Illustrated cross-sections of the brain did little to illuminate the workings of my own mind. I needed time and space for introspection. The solution came in the form of a book club that later became an official course.At Georgetown, the goal of our new literature and medicine track is to foster habits of reflection over four years of medical school. On the surface, the assigned books have nothing to do with medicine. We read no patient narratives, doctors memoirs or stories about disease.Todays topic is Haruki Murakamis novel Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, which tells the story of a depressed middle-aged Tokyoites attempt to retrace his past in order to understand how his life became so empty. We talk about the main characters colorless perception of the world, and why his mind feels so inaccessible to us.I receive an email from a student later that evening. He, an aspiring psychiatrist, tells me the story of a much-admired college mentor. I heard last week that he committed suicide. I am still crushed, he writes. He was diagnosed with depression but seemed to be doing great. If he so misjudged his teachers state of mind, he worries, how will he make it as a psychiatrist?Earlier this year, we placed the ethics of animal testing under the magnifying glass of Karen Joy Fowlers We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The novel is narrated by a woman whose sibling, we later discover, is a chimpanzee who was raised with her as part of a human-chimp experiment. We used the book to think through real-life examples like the Silver Spring Monkeys  a series of gruesome primate experiments that both galvanized American animal-rights groups and led to breakthrough scientific discoveries.A third-year student talked about the three years he spent working with rhesus macaques. Research from his lab led to breakthrough discoveries about memory and behavior and contributed to therapies such as deep brain stimulation. Doesnt that answer the ethical questions? he asked.Another student talked about studies that she worked on for several years before starting medical school. Have you heard of professional testers? she asked the room. People whose only source of income is volunteering for different studies, mostly college kids and immigrants? Shouldnt we be talking about human research also? For me, the discussion proved transformative. I walked into that class firmly supporting animal research and walked away still supporting research but no longer eating meat.Our busy jobs on the hospital wards require precision and efficiency, but in literature class we can slow down and explore human lives and thoughts in a different, more complex way. The class is an anatomy lab of the mind. We examine cultural conventions and conflicting perspectives, and reflect on our own preconceived notions about life and work. Reading attentively and well, we hope, will become a sustaining part of our daily lives and practice.As Im walking out of the classroom at the end of the evening, a third-year student approaches me to tell me hes been thinking more deeply about his experience of being an unrelated organ donor to his step-uncle, a man he barely knew. Its been on my mind since we read Ishiguros Never Let Me Go last month, he says. I want to write about it. I dont even know how I feel about it, and I need to figure it out.Daniel Marchalik, M.D., is a urologist in Washington and heads the literature and medicine track at the Georgetown University School of Medicine."}
{"text": "In the 1996 black comedy Welcome to the Dollhouse, Heather Matarazzo and Brendan Sexton III played Dawn Wiener and Brandon McCarthy, grade-school outcasts, nerd and bully. At first antagonists, they become tentative allies, only to be separated by suburban fate. Wiener-Dog, the new film also from the writer-director Todd Solondz, is not  title aside  a Dollhouse sequel. But it does depict Dawn and Brandon reunited (and it feels so weird).One episode in this omnibus film features the still-awkward Dawn and the mildly surly Brandon as adults (here played by Greta Gerwig and Kieran Culkin) embarking on an impulsive journey, witnessed by the films titular impassive dachshund. Recurring characters in sequels and franchises are as common as, well, sequels and franchises; recurring characters in movies that arent sequels are more rare, and more fun. Here are a few.Caldicott and Charters played by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford in The Lady Vanishes (1938), Night Train to Munich (1940) and Crooks Tour (1941).For the Alfred Hitchcock-directed Vanishes, a brisk espionage mystery set aboard a fast-moving train, the screenwriters Sidney Gilliat and Frank Lauder concocted a pair of cricket-crazy middle-age tourists  satirical targets making a point about complacency in prewar Britain  who comedically huff and puff about confounded impudence. For Night Train, another spy picture with less train action than the title implies, the pair returned, evincing slightly more interest in current events: One of them is seen reading Mein Kampf. The fellows got a vehicle of their own in Crooks Tour. Mr. Wayne and Mr. Radford also played the characters on radio, and variations of the fellows in pictures such as 1946s Dead of Night.Dr. Louis Judd played by Tom Conway in Cat People (1942) and The Seventh Victim (1943).The suave Mr. Conway played a lecherous psychiatrist in the 1942 horror classic Cat People. Dr. Judd learns the hard way that its poor form to trifle with a woman who turns into a panther when sexually aroused. Despite his fate in Cat People, Mr. Conway turned up as the same character in Victim, this time trying to shelter a young woman who has come under the sway of a bohemian Satan-worshipping sect. The Judd in this picture is similarly haughty but eventually more sympathetic.Randolph and Mortimer Duke played by Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche in Trading Places (1983) and Coming to America (1988).The director John Landis cast the likable Hollywood golden-age actors Mr. Ameche and Mr. Bellamy against type as rapacious capitalist brothers for the Dan Aykroyd-Eddie Murphy, switched-identity farce, Trading Places. That film ended with the Duke boys (deservedly) ruined. Coming to America finds the brothers in a decidedly unglamorous setting for an amusing cameo in which they benefit from the casual largess of Mr. Murphys African prince.Mookie played by the director Spike Lee in Do The Right Thing (1989) and Red Hook Summer (2012).The disaffected Bed-Stuy pizza delivery man played by Mr. Lee in his spectacular urban epic carries a pie in a different neighborhood almost 25 years later in his fevered 2012 indie drama. Mr. Lee even has a back story for the shift in neighborhoods.Jay and Silent Bob played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith in Clerks (1994), and many, many more films.The perpetually buzzed Jersey boys turned up like mascots in each of the writer-director Mr. Smiths movies from Clerks to 1999s Dogma, before getting their Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back in 2001. The pair has not made a live-action movie appearance since 2006s Clerks II.Earl McGraw played by Michael Parks in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) and Grindhouse (2007).Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino, inspired in part by the interconnected characters in comic books, set their movies in relatively coherent omniverses, as fans refer to them. To that end, Mr. Tarantino cast the cult favorite Mr. Parks (initially of televisions Then Came Bronson fame) to float through several films as a stalwart lawman named Earl McGraw. His function varies from movie to movie; hes always good to have around. (And while some see Kill Bill Vol. 2 as a sequel, it is in fact the second half of what had been a four-hour picture. Miramax, the distributor, saw more sense in splitting it into halves.)Ray Nicolette played by Michael Keaton in Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998).When Mr. Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh discovered that they were almost simultaneously shooting adaptations of two Elmore Leonard novels that featured Ray, the same cocky-but-slightly-dim federal agent, in a supporting role, it seemed only natural to cast Mr. Keaton to play him in both films. And fortunately Mr. Keaton was game. (Incidentally, the younger selves of two other prominent characters in Jackie Brown, Louis and Melanie, are featured in 2014s Life of Crime, adapted from Mr. Leonards The Switch.)Aldous Snow played by Russell Brand in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) and Get Him to the Greek (2010).Mr. Brands drugged-up, manically libidinous rock star Snow was a challenging romantic rival to Jason Segel in Marshall and an impossible-to-manage charge for Jonah Hills beleaguered record-company stooge in Greek. To slightly confuse matters, Mr. Hill also appears in Marshall, albeit playing a different character in that movie. That brings us back to the top, since Margaret Lockwood was the female lead in both The Lady Vanishes and Night Train to Munich, but played two different characters."}

{"text": "The Phenom is a baseball movie with virtually no baseball, which would be fine if the thing it relied on instead  lots and lots of talking  exhibited zest and originality. It doesnt.Hopper (Johnny Simmons) is a cant-miss pitching prospect who suddenly cant find the plate. The professional club that awarded him a fat contract tries to salvage its investment by sending him to a sports therapist (Paul Giamatti), and gradually a familiar back story emerges: Hopper was, and still is, relentlessly pressured by his father (Ethan Hawke) to excel.Its a variation of all those childrens movies and TV shows in which a Little Leaguer or pee-wee football player is browbeaten by a parent trying to relive his or her own childhood. The director and writer, Noah Buschel, has no fresh insights to add to the well-worn dynamic and doesnt give the actors or the audience much to work with.Mr. Simmons seems unsure of what hes trying to convey, and Mr. Giamatti finds nothing of note in his slim role. Only Mr. Hawke, whose character is a snarling ex-con, grabs the attention, but by the time the film peters out, he, too, has done about all he can do with the material."}
{"text": "BEIJING  An unusually fierce tornado ravaged an eastern Chinese city on Thursday, killing at least 98 people and injuring 800 others, catapulting cars, ginkgo trees and cellphone towers through the air, and reducing homes to piles of debris, the authorities said.The storm in Yancheng, a city of 7.1 million overlooking the Yellow Sea, featured wind gusts exceeding 80 miles an hour by some accounts.The skies turned dark and we thought the summer torrential rain was about to begin, said a resident of Yancheng, according to a live-blog published by Sina, a web portal. We ran to our house. Suddenly, the roof was blown apart, bricks were falling and the house collapsed.Televisions flashed with scenes of horror: hospitals overwhelmed with casualties, residents combing through piles of rubble for their belongings, and dust-covered arms and legs jutting from the ground.President Xi Jinping called for an all-out rescue effort, according to CCTV, the state broadcaster, and the authorities said that hundreds of rescuers had been sent to Yancheng to sort through the wreckage. Nearly half of the injured were in serious condition, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs said late Thursday.The tornado, which began around 2:30 p.m. and was accompanied by hailstorms, destroyed thousands of homes and stores, as well as several manufacturing plants and rice mills, according to news reports. Yancheng is known as a center of textile production and farming in Jiangsu Province.A man who gave his last name as Zhang told China News Service that he had been driving along a street when he noticed that trees were falling in a strange way. He pulled over, and soon the winds lifted his car and threw it into a river.Tornadoes are relatively common in Jiangsu Province, in Chinas southeast, with more than 1,000 recorded over the past six decades, according to Chinese news reports. Southern China has faced several bouts of extreme weather recently, with floods killing more than 20 people this week.The tornado that struck Yancheng was particularly violent, and the authorities were still trying to make sense of the high death toll."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The continuing breakdown in Washingtons ability to govern seemed to spread like a contagion Thursday through all three branches of government.The dysfunction somehow managed to reach new levels. The Supreme Court, left short-handed by a Republican refusal to act on President Obamas nominee in the final year of his presidency, deadlocked on a major immigration case. The inaction validated a lower court finding against the administrations attempt to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to live legally in the United States.Mr. Obama, who sought to address the nations immigration crisis through his executive powers because of a persistent impasse on Capitol Hill, was unable to achieve one of his major goals  which pleased Republicans but left the president angry and disappointed.Democrats ended a raucous 25-hour protest on the House floor, failing to gain a vote on gun safety issues but exulting in the attention they received via a breakout social media campaign that threw the House rule book out the Capitols neoclassical windows. Republican leaders accused Democrats of trying to capitalize on the Orlando, Fla., shooting while destroying the decorum of the House.The decision by Democrats to act out in the House was just the latest attempt to upend the political status quo in a year distinguished by political disruption, from Donald J. Trump rattling the Republican establishment to Senator Bernie Sanders  the democratic socialist who made an appearance at the House protest  drawing huge crowds of young voters with calls to radically change the way Americans think about government.Partisan turmoil is nothing new in Washington. But the cloistered Supreme Court now finds itself disrupted as well by its empty seat, unable to fully function because of a Senate unwilling to act.In what passes in todays capital for a breakthrough, eight Senate Republicans joined Democrats in giving majority support to a bipartisan compromise to prevent terrorism suspects from buying firearms. But that plan, engineered by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, can go nowhere until she rounds up significantly more Republican support.Tempers were short and patience waned after a long night of confrontation on the House floor occupied by Democrats to the outrage of Republicans, who forced an adjournment vote shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday.This is the peoples House, this is Congress, the House of Representatives, the oldest democracy in the world and theyre descending it into chaos, Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters Thursday as the protest was winding up. This isnt a proud moment for democracy or for the people who staged these stunts.As part of that final vote, House Republicans approved and sent to the Senate a bill to address the Zika health threat months after the White House sought the money. But the package, assembled with little Democratic participation, contained elements they knew Senate Democrats would oppose. The calculation appeared to be that if Democrats now block it, they will the ones blamed rather than Republicans.Democrats saw that as just another provocation.What you are seeing happening is a level of frustration that is just boiling over, said Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, one of the ringleaders of the Democratic floor revolt.For the duration of the sit-in, the House chamber, where electronic devices and photographs are frowned on, was awash in selfies, Facebook Live and Periscope. Even normally staid C-Span engaged in guerrilla video warfare, streaming a feed from a House members phone on its House channel, showing the action as seen from the floor instead of the usual camera angles from the gallery above.House Democrats joyfully flouted House rules. Republicans said that some of their members urged the leadership to employ a cell-signal-jamming device to cut off the coverage, but that was deemed a bad idea.Mr. Ryan and other Republicans suggested there could be repercussions in the form of ethics complaints or other actions against Democrats.Were reviewing everything, he said. We are reviewing everything right now, as to what happened and how to make sure that we can bring order to this chaos.What the payoff will be for that chaos orchestrated by House Democrats remains unclear. They were already expected to gain seats in the November election but a takeover is still considered a long shot, even with Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee. And Mr. Ryan showed that he could still command the majority-really-rules House even during the protest.Still, the defiance by House Democrats, who angrily declined to head out of town without so much as a vote on gun control after the killings in Orlando proved that they were willing to fight. They had seen their brethren in the Senate, who have much more legislative leverage, force a vote on gun proposals and did not want to be pushed aside by the House majority.But the inability of the Supreme Court to issue a decision, the Senate stalemate on guns, the dispute over Zika and the disorder on the House floor as lawmakers almost came to blows in an American version of foreign legislators duking it out could just turn people off Washington even more  if that is possible.With dawn just a few hours off, Mr. Ryan jammed through the Zika spending bill and his motion to adjourn to allow Republicans to leave town without even so much as the briefest of debates.So were locked out of everything, if I am understanding the rule correctly? Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is considered an expert on House rules, asked of Mr. Ryan. This is a lousy process, Mr. Speaker.The House, as they say on Capitol Hill, was not in order, and the rest of the government was struggling as well."}
{"text": "Even before noon on a recent Friday, every table at Squirrel & the Bee, a gluten- and grain-free cafe and bakery that opened in Short Hills, N.J., in 2014, was occupied. Were all these people gluten free?I ordered the kale salad with dates and a cup of tomato pumpkin soup. Although the combination of tomato and pumpkin seems improbable, in the case of this sweet and tart soup, it worked. I was surprised. I do not have celiac disease and, in general, eat everything (an occupational requirement). And yet, both items, even the lemony vinaigrette on the salad, were terrific.I returned a week later for the much-praised pumpkin granola. Skeptical, I wondered how granola made without grain could be palatable. Again, the food caught me off guard. It was first-rate. I bought a whole bag, which Squirrel & the Bee sells along with cereals, nuts, coffees, teas and baked goods. Like many items for sale there, the granola was labeled with letters that deemed it suitable for various diets: G (gluten free); D (dairy free); P (Paleo); S (specific carbohydrate diet); and E (egg free). Also, everything is kosher.Michelle Retik, the owner, explained on the phone after my visits that her customers come from as far away as Holland and Canada, where they have read about it on gluten-free websites. At least 50 percent, however, have no particular allergies. Presumably they come, as I now will, because the food is bright, fresh and skillfully prepared.The story of the cafes origins, and Ms. Retiks evolution into a grain- and dairy-free chef, explains, to a large extent, the character of the place.A newly single parent of four and a former merchandise planner, Ms. Retik decided to switch career gears in 2008. Being a pastry chef had always been her dream, and after graduating from the Institute for Culinary Education in 2009, she achieved it. Flour and sugar had become her tools. Working sometimes 12 hours a day, she simply assumed that her stomach maladies were the result of being a busy single mother. When her weight dropped to 87 pounds, she was given a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. The children were late for school 27 times that year, she said. I couldnt even get out of the house in the morning.After conventional treatments and doctors did not help, Ms. Retik embarked on a strategy based on her own reading. It worked: On Wednesday, I rid my kitchen of grains, refined sugars and dairy; on Friday, I got out of bed, walked the dog and felt awesome. Even Thomas McCarrick, the doctor who was her fianc at the time and is now her husband, marveled at the change. What happened? she recalled his asking.During the next few years, she perfected the recipes for her restricted diet. They are the basis of what she now serves to more than 2,500 customers a week.Stylishly decorated with aged silver wood, splashes of turquoise and a rotating display of art, the cafe attracts crowds that are typical of Short Hills (lots of Lululemon), as well as people from out of town, out of state and occasionally out of the country. The food is simply that good.Ms. Retiks asparagus, leek and dill quiche, for example, is fluffier than most quiches because it is made without cheese and the crust relies on coconut oil and almond flour, rather than the more leaden vegetable oil and white flour. A dish called Michelles eggs, scrambled with spinach and tomatoes in coconut oil and served with a generous smear of eggplant tapenade and guacamole, is delightfully hearty.If youve sampled only store-bought almond or coconut milk, Ms. Retiks homemade versions are worth the extra 75 cents charged when added to cereal. The milks also pair well with Ms. Retiks fluffy muffins (the eggs in her muffins are beaten for about 20 minutes).For dessert, the pumpkin pie and raspberry coconut tarts are popular, and cakes come in basic vanilla or more exotic flavors like chai. Three-tier wedding cakes, popular in June, come laden with real orchids and fresh berries. On waffle Sundays, more customers appear than at any other time during the week.Squirrel & the Bee (alluding to the nuts and honey that figure in many of the recipes) has its detractors: Some find the flavors to be too subtle.On the other hand, in the 18 months since it opened, Squirrel & the Bee has sold 50,000 muffins; the staff has expanded to 34 employees from six, and 12 Whole Foods stores throughout New Jersey, Connecticut and New York recently decided to sell some of its baked goods.No one is more surprised than Ms. Retik. Shocked and amazed, she said, surveying the crowd on a recent Sunday. Its a joy to see myself and my business thrive."}
{"text": "The International Center of Photography is back, and welcome. Two years after losing its Midtown Manhattan quarters, the center has reopened on the Bowery, across from the New Museum. The duplex galleries, on street and basement levels, are, technically, larger than the old ones, though they feel boxy and closed-in, at least for the opening show, Public, Private, Secret. As if to offset this impression, the show gives evidence that the centers view of photography itself has expanded.In its 2014 Triennial, the center made a serious move toward embracing digital media, and now it has fully done so. Photography no longer means pictures printed and framed. It also means images, infinite in number, flowing in real-time data streams and captured on webcams, video blogs, Twitter and Instagram. This institutional shift in emphasis from hard objects to the broad field of visual culture will make old-style connoisseurs crazy, but it is in line with the centers history.It was founded in 1974 largely as a showcase for street photography, war photography and other socially committed and essentially journalistic genres: Content was as important as form. The inclusion of digital media maintains that interest, with the internet now functioning as both boulevard and battlefield, and  this really is new  where photographers were once a distinctive and specialized crew, now almost everyone is armed, for better and worse, with picture-taking devices and the means to distribute images.The defining of better and worse forms the basis for a stimulating and unsettling exhibition. Its digital orientation is established right at the start with a projected video based on borrowings from social media. The piece, by Natalie Bookchin, is divided into thematic sections, each a visual patchwork of talking heads, mostly of young, English-speaking men and women gathered from online video diaries. In one sequence, all the heads speak of their experience with psychiatric medications, in another with losing jobs.Ms. Bookchins editing is inventive and revealing. Every time a word or phrase common to all the diaries occurs, all the heads say it in unison, interrupting films otherwise random-seeming this-speaker-then-that-speaker flow. The overall effect is twofold: You get a sense of the existence of a digitally connected community of suffering, one with a shared vocabulary and set of emotions. You also begin to wonder, as you do when you overhear public cellphone conversations: How is it possible that so many people are living such clichd lives?The raw material for a 2012 video by Doug Rickard is also digital, but of a different kind: found images of American crime scenes and police actions uploaded from cellphones and posted on YouTube. Mr. Rickard collages excerpts from various postings into fictional narratives, notable less for their plotlines than for the atmosphere of danger they project. That atmosphere is similar to one generated by news media and the film industry, an adrenalin-fueled mood of fear, suspicion and emergency, encouraging violence.In one way or another, much of the show  assembled by Charlotte Cotton, the centers first curator in residence, working with Pauline Vermare, associate curator, and Marina Chao, assistant curator  is built around the basic elements of Mr. Rickards work: surveillance crossing into voyeurism, visual fiction standing in for truth. But then, hasnt photography always had a predatory streak, an eye for existential dirt, an impulse to lie if that will grab attention? Sure, and there are plenty of predigital demonstrations of that here.Among them are old French and Mexican mug shots of criminal suspects, and a 1942 shot by the Bowery habitu Arthur Fellig, known as Weegee, of two drunk-and-disorderly swells cowering behind face-hiding hats in a paddy wagon. Far more complicated are four mug-shot-style portraits of Berber or Muslim women taken in 1960 by Marc Garanger in Algeria, when he was working for the French Army. The women, confined to a concentration camp, were forced to unveil for the sittings and stare at the camera with undisguised, level-eyed fury.These are images of violation. There are others, several associated with celebrity culture. In a 1971 photograph we see Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dashing across a lawn in Central Park, apparently fleeing the photographer, Ron Galella, who had been stalking her for years. Two internet-savvy contemporary artists, Ann Hirsch and Marisa Olson, turn the humiliation of losing highly visible competitions  a reality dating show, an American Idol audition  into triumphs of self-engineered failure. And in a flawless win-win power move, the media star Kim Kardashian assumes the role of auto-stalker, publishing a book consisting entirely of her own selfies.I cant speak for Ms. Kardashian, but many of the shows younger participants are clearly well aware that they, and we, are being observed, photographed, biometrically tracked and profiled whether we want to be or not, and that this is a problem. And at least one artist, Zach Blas, is doing something about it. He has designed a blobby pink plastic mask to thwart facial recognition scanning, a technology with the potential, possibly already realized, of using racial and sexual stereotyping to isolate groups of social undesirables.Racial stereotyping has, of course, a long history and artists have tried all kinds of ways to deal with it. A decade or so ago, the intriguing Chicago-based photographer and filmmaker Barbara DeGenevieve (1947-2014) hired five homeless men, all African-American, to pose nude for her in a hotel room. When she exhibited the results as The Panhandler Project, she took serious critical heat, with many viewers calling the work exploitive. Some will still find it so, though as the mechanics of American economic privilege grow starker, her attempt to confuse roles usually dictated by ethnicity, class and gender looks more and more useful.Ms. Cotton includes only a single photograph from Ms. DeGenevieves project, and its hard to get much from that. But another meditation on race, and specifically on blackness, Martine Symss video installation Lessons I-LXVIII, is the shows most substantial piece in terms of length. Its composed in 10-minute units, each made up of randomly sorted 30-second clips related to African-American life, lifted from online videos and visual blogs, including home movies, video diaries, police webcams and advertisements. Many of the fragments are hard to grasp on their own, but together they turn the black presence, still marginalized in mainstream American art and culture, into something substantial, integral and self-sustaining, a whole and sufficient cloth.Ms. Symss ambitious work, dated 2014-16, brings us again into the digital realm, which can be uneven ground to visit. A set of flat screens streaming real-time data from Twitter and other social media sources keeps the show in the 24/7 now, where it should be. And the information, organized by Mark Ghuneim, an internet entrepreneur, and students from the centers New Media Narratives program and sometimes presented in the form of online addresses, gives a good sense of the pervasive influence of digital technology on daily life, whether in police surveillance or assignment of pop star status. At the same time, the piece offers few visual rewards, and demands smartphone finger work to access its information.And if Ms. Bookchins conglomerate snapshot of a video diary culture hints at a condition of passive narcissism as the dominant malady of life inside the digital bubble, Jon Rafmans short, composite 2014 video Mainsqueeze is infinitely more damning. Its seven-minute sequence of found Google Street View images drops you into a deep pit of physical and psychological cruelty, and cracks the door on a dark side of the social media age that this exhibition otherwise barely hints at. No wonder 21st-century karma is in such horrendous shape.The visual content of this piece is a far cry from the museum quality images usually associated with the center as a collecting institution. And the exhibition itself, with its mirrored walls and jumble of unalike works, has a looseness that most museums, intent on writing clear narratives, would clean up. At this point, though, visual culture  digital production, including photography  is so abundant and changing so fast that no clear narrative is possible. Photography fans hoping that the return of the center will mean a return of its vintage collection may have to wait awhile. This institution, so often ahead of the curve, has other, challenging ideas on its mind, and the less it acts like a museum the better."}
{"text": "Color, Josef Albers wrote in the introduction to his 1963 book, Interaction of Color, is the most relative medium in art. No one, in other words, sees the same hue the same way.For Chromatic, the choreographer Susan Marshall, the composer Jason Treuting and the visual artist Suzanne Bocanegra have joined forces to show how colors are susceptible to change, how they affect emotions and how they evoke different sounds. One big issue  beyond do colors have sounds?  has to do with the difference between reality and perception when sensing color.In Chromatic, part of American Dance Institutes festival of works at the Kitchen, there are piles of colored paper and heaps of fabric. But perhaps what this color study really proves is how challenging it is to make an inspiring work about an inspiring book. Chromatic, which opened on Thursday, is more of an art history class than a performance piece. It could use a firmer directorial hand, but, more than that, it needs a point of view.Chromatic begins as Ms. Marshall and Mr. Treuting sit impassively behind a table, holding up pieces of colored paper (in the yellow family) while silently commenting on each one with nearly imperceptible sighs and smiles. As they continue, they hold smaller squares on larger ones to show pleasing (or not) color contrasts and eventually  you probably had a hunch it was coming  toss the pieces into the air until the stage is aflutter with paper in shades of lemon and mango.While Ms. Bocanegra discusses Albers  and also Hans Richter, Isaac Newton and Rajneesh, an Indian guru whose disciples on an Oregon commune wore shades of red  Ms. Marshall and Mr. Treuting illustrate the experiential side of color. (Eric Southerns lighting design experiments with altering the shades of primary colors.)In one scene, Mr. Treuting calls out numbers that relate to upper and lower body poses; with her usual steely precision, Ms. Marshall layers movements, as if to show the way colors are transformed by pigment and light. But too much of Chromatic is adrift, landing on the juvenile side of playful.Even with the amiable Ms. Bocanegra as a guide, this presentation of research  and many slides, which awkwardly, didnt always appear as planned on Thursday  is theatrically lethargic. A show of light and color at the end comes too late: Our eyes never slip into a new reality."}

My colleagues at The Timess Race/Related newsletter, which is devoted to coverage of and conversations about race, have started a cool new reporting project on how food shapes our identity. Theyre asking readers just like you what youll be cooking, eating or drinking this summer that speaks to race, family and identity in advance of publishing some of the stories, photographs of family gatherings and food (and perhaps some of your recipes, too!) in a subsequent edition of the newsletter.So whether your summer cooking tradition is embutido from the Philippines, Los Angeles-style carne asada, or a block of Jarlsberg, Triscuits and a cold bottle of vodka from the White Bridge liquor shop in Darien, Conn., please take part in their survey. It will be fascinating to see what everyones cooking, and how, and why.But perhaps you want to try cooking something new this weekend? Ive got an ace recipe up on Cooking this week, for the grilled chicken parm served at the Speedy Romeo restaurants in Brooklyn and on the Lower East Side. Justin Bazdarich, the chef and an owner, talked me through the technique of making it for a column in The Times Magazine. I hope youll read that, too.Or maybe you could assay Julia Moskins recipe for porchetta, which she just brought home from Umbria. Its designed for cooking on a grill, but you could knock it down in an oven if a grills unavailable to you. Serve it with bread or sage-scented roast potatoes.After reading Ligaya Mishans sweet review of the Crabby Shack, a seafood emporium in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, all you may want to do is eat crab. I like the Brooklyn tough guy Tony Durazzos recipe for spaghetti and crabs on a summer evening. Or Matt Lee and Ted Lees adaptation of the recipe for chili crab that Zakary Pelaccio used to serve at Fatty Crab in New York.Hot crab and oyster dip from Melissa Clark? Steamed blue crabs? If you can find some peelers, as the kids down in The City That Reads call soft-shell crabs, try Melissas recipe for soft-shell crab toast.Then, for dessert, you may try Emily Weinsteins recipe for the simplest strawberry tart (or my even easier recipe for poundcake and strawberries, which truthfully you could make with an Entenmanns loaf and still be happy). Or you could make whoopie pies!That should get you started, anyway. Other recipes to cook this weekend can be found on Cooking, as always. Please save the ones you like to your recipe box and rate them when youre done cooking. Did you successfully substitute lamb for beef, anchovies for soy sauce, watercress for sorrel? Leave a note on the recipe so that others may benefit from your adventurousness.And if you run into problems, either with our technology or with something weve written, please ask for help. Were at cookingcare@nytimes.com. As for me, Im a digital immigrant with a love of his country. Reach me on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest, or send a note to foodeditor@nytimes.com.Now, lets watch Andre Previn and Dinah Shore sing Begin the Beguine and April in Paris together (and at the same time!) in 1959. Have you seen the beguiling trailer for Swallows and Amazons yet? Or the somewhat more terrifying one for The Shallows? Absolutely, let us bow our heads for Ralph Stanley, the king of mountain music, who died yesterday at 89. Here he is singing O Death."}
{"text": "Anyone trying to explain Britains decision to exit the European Union must consider the countrys economy, its citizens attitudes toward immigration, its generational divides and the coverage of the debate in the news media.But there is another force to consider, too: the role of the worlds most influential social media platforms  Facebook, in particular. More than 33 million people in Britain use Facebook each month, according to estimates by eMarketer, a research company.A few data points about the vast online conversation before the vote suggest that the people supporting the leave campaign were far more engaged on the issue than their opponents on social media.Using data pulled from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics firm that has a partnership with Facebook, The New York Times ranked Facebook pages that had the most engagement  how many people liked, shared and commented on posts  around the term European Union over the last 30 days.Seven of the top 20 pages with the most engagement around European Union, including the top two, were explicitly pro-exit. Together, these seven pages produced more than 1.3 million interactions  including the page for Nigel Farage, a leading proponent of the leave campaign, at No. 6.Only two pages  those of the group Britain Stronger in Europe, No. 8, and the British Prime Minister David Cameron, No. 18  were clearly associated with remain campaigns, and together, they accounted for just under 150,000 interactions.A search for Brexit, the widely used shorthand for the vote, produced a similar ranking. Other top pages included British and American news organizations that had broad news coverage, as well as pro-leave and pro-remain opinion columns.An analysis of two opposing campaign pages underscores the wide gap in reader activity. By Friday, a primary page for the remain campaign, Britain Stronger in Europe, had passed 558,000 followers. Its close counterpart  Leave. EU  led in followers, at just over 767,000. But the pages total engagement figures, which approximate total conversations around all their posts, were far more disparate.Over the last six months, posts on remain pages resulted in more than 3.3 million interactions  that is likes, shares and comments  averaging about 475,000 a month. The leave page produced more than 11 million, or about three times as many.Between these groups, the official leave message, in other words, landed harder and most likely spread further on Facebook by a large margin.This month, Vyacheslav Polonski, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, published a study of Brexit campaigns activity on Instagram. Mr. Polonski analyzed the activities of over 15,000 users who engaged in the referendum debate.Weve noted that E.U. skeptics and Brexit supporters dominate the debate and are more effective in their use of Instagram for activating and mobilizing people across the country, he wrote. They also tend to be more passionate, active and outspoken in their online behavior, he continued, noting that they generated almost five times as many posts as their opponents.As for Twitter, the analytics firm Talkwalker noted a substantial lead in leave-related hashtags over remain-related hashtags in May, suggesting there was more discussion on the leave side. In the last few weeks, though, the sides hashtags were nearly even, and in the final days before the vote, Twitters hashtags tilted toward remain.Social media, by nature, is both a catalyst and a place for conversation. As such, the apparent dominance of pro-leave posts on Facebook and Instagram is neither a pure reflection of popular will nor a product of the services, but more likely something in between.A full picture of voter sentiment on social media is visible only to the social media companies themselves. And the rate at which sharing and engaging on a social media platform translates into action is difficult to quantify.Leave. EU left little up to chance. SHARE IF YOU CARE, it wrote in a post published two hours before the polls closed across Britain. Make sure you vote NOW before its too late, read a post an hour later."}
{"text": "WIMBLEDON, England  Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer have met in the last two Wimbledon finals, but if Federer is to stop the dominant run Djokovic is on, he will have to do it in the semifinals.Federer, a seven-time Wimbledon champion, is seeded third here after missing the French Open with a back injury, and on Friday he was placed in Djokovics half of the draw, which will begin play Monday.Fridays draw laid out the possible obstacles to a historic summer for the top-ranked Djokovic, who currently holds all four Grand Slam titles.Djokovic has won Wimbledon the past two years, and another victory at the All England Club would set up an attempt at the first mens singles Grand Slam since Rod Laver in 1969 at the United States Open.With an Olympic gold medal also at stake this summer, Djokovic would have a shot at a Golden Slam, a feat only achieved in singles by Steffi Graf in 1988.Djokovic, who opens against 177th-ranked James Ward of Britain, has a favorable draw until the quarterfinals, where he could face sixth-seeded Milos Raonic before a potential meeting with Federer in the semifinals.Whether Federer is in strong enough form to make a deep run is one of this tournaments biggest questions. He lost in the semifinals of grass-court events in Stuttgart and Halle coming into Wimbledon, but said he was fairly satisfied with his rehabilitation from knee and back injuries this year.The seeds in Federers quarter of the draw include No. 5 Kei Nishikori, No. 9 Marin Cilic and No. 17 Gal Monfils.Second-seeded Andy Murray, who lost to Djokovic in the final of the Australian and French Opens this year, will open against his fellow Briton Liam Broady.His half of the draw, which begins play Tuesday, is a whos who of the future of mens tennis, featuring eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem, 22; No. 24 Alexander Zverev, 19; and No. 15 Nick Kyrgios, 21, a potential fourth-round opponent for Murray.Thiem, coming off a semifinal berth at the French Open, achieved his highest seeding at a Grand Slam event, but in the first round will face Florian Mayer, who beat Thiem in the semifinals in Halle last week. Zverev or No. 10 Tomas Berdych are possible fourth-round opponents for Thiem.Also in Murrays half of the draw, fourth-seeded Stan Wawrinka will face the American teenager Taylor Fritz in the first round before a possible second-round meeting with Juan Martn del Potro, a former semifinalist here before wrist injuries derailed his career.In the womens draw, top-seeded Serena Williams, who is seeking her first Grand Slam title since last years Wimbledon, begins play Tuesday against the qualifier Amra Sadikovic of Switzerland.The highest seed in her quarter of the draw is No. 6 Roberta Vinci, who upset Williams in the semifinals of the United States Open last year. But Vinci faces a difficult first-round test against the American Alison Riske, who excels on grass courts.In the third round, Williams could play Heather Watson of Britain, who came within two points of beating Williams at Wimbledon last year, or Kristina Mladenovic of France, who lost a tight third-round match to Williams at the French Open.No. 3 Agnieszka Radwanska; No. 7 Belinda Bencic, who has struggled with injuries this year; and No. 10 Petra Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, are also in Williamss half of the draw.The French Open champion, Garbie Muguruza, is seeded second after reaching the final here last year as the No. 20 seed. She plays Camila Giorgi of Italy in the first round on Monday.The eighth-seeded Venus Williams is a possible quarterfinal opponent for Muguruza, while No. 4 Angelique Kerber, the Australian Open winner; No. 5 Simona Halep; and No. 9 Madison Keys, who entered the top 10 for the first time this week, loom in the other quarter as possible semifinal challenges.Muguruzas quarter also features a first-round match between the doubles partners Lucie Safarova and Bethanie Mattek-Sands, who have won two Grand Slam titles together.Sixth-ranked Victoria Azarenka withdrew from the tournament on Thursday because of a knee injury. Rafael Nadal will also miss Wimbledon with a wrist injury."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Three agents knocked on the door of a modest duplex in a Wisconsin town just after dawn. The Mexican immigrant living on the ground floor stuck his head outThey asked his name and he gave it. Within minutes Jos Cervantes Amaral was in handcuffs as his wife, also from Mexico, silently watched. After 18 years working and living quietly in the United States, Mr. Cervantes, who did not have legal papers, rode away in the back seat, heading for deportation.It is a routine that continues daily. The Supreme Court on Thursday effectively ended initiatives by President Obama that would have given protection from deportation to more than four million immigrants in the country illegally, most of them parents of American citizens. Mr. Obama showed his frustration with the decision, saying his goal was to help immigrants who had raised families here and helped the country with their work. The president said immigrants who might have qualified for the programs would still be safe from deportation.Still, deportations continue, thousands every week.In November 2014 when Mr. Obama first announced the protection programs, he also set new priorities for enforcement. Since then, immigration authorities say, their focus is on removing convicted criminals and foreigners who pose national security threats. But the administrations priorities also include deporting migrants from Central America, including children, who came in an influx since 2014. And immigrants who committed minor offenses  or none at all  are often swept up in the operations.After Thursdays Supreme Court decision, the presidents protections are gone, but the enforcement plan remains in effect. It is part of a particularly edgy moment for immigrants and their supporters framed by the Supreme Court ruling, Donald J. Trumps presidential campaign and Britains surprise vote, influenced in part by anti-immigrant sentiments, to leave the European Union.Last year, immigration authorities deported 235,413 people, according to official figures. Of those, 59 percent were convicted criminals, and 98 percent fit within the administrations priorities, Department of Homeland Security officials said. The top priority includes foreigners who pose a threat to national or border security or to public safety. Other priorities are for people with serious criminal records, but they also include any migrant caught entering the country illegally after Jan. 1, 2014.Homeland Security officials said Friday that the Supreme Court decision would have no effect on the pace or strategy of enforcement.Our limited enforcement resources will not be focused on the removal of those who have committed no serious crimes, have been in this country for years and have families here, said Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the department. Under this policy, these people are not priorities for removal, nor should they be.Mr. Obama has carried out many more deportations than previous presidents, setting a record of more than 2.4 million formal removals.But Republican lawmakers point to a sharp decrease in deportations  down 43 percent in 2015 from 409,849 in 2012  to say that Mr. Obama has all but stopped enforcing immigration law. When will the Obama administration end its reckless policies that wreak havoc on our communities? asked Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.But what is not enough enforcement for some is too much for others. This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is known as ICE, said it had arrested 331 immigrants in May and June in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Kansas and Missouri. The operations were its latest effort to arrest and remove convicted criminal aliens, said Ricardo Wong, the director of the agencys office in Chicago.By focusing our resources on the most egregious offenders, Mr. Wong said, we ensure the very best use of our resources while immediately improving public safety.One of those arrested was Mr. Cervantes.In 2006, Mr. Cervantes said in an interview by telephone on Friday, he was caught up in an immigration raid at a factory near his workplace. Local police who assisted in the raid arrested him, finding  mistakenly, he says  that he was working with documents under a false name.Mr. Cervantes, a construction worker, pleaded guilty to an identity theft offense, a low-level felony. A decade later, after he and his wife raised two daughters in Genoa City, Wis., immigration agents came to his door to deport him.The shock for my wife was very strong, Mr. Cervantes said. She has been in treatment at local hospitals for kidney cancer, he said. If we have to go back to Mexico, I wont have her for long.He has been released while he fights his immigration case.The administration is continuing to deport people who should not be a priority, said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, an organization that assisted Mr. Cervantes. Mr. Obama, she said, can do much more to prevent the unnecessary breakup of families.Some clearly are in the priority group. On Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had arrested 45 foreigners who had been listed by Interpol as wanted for serious crimes, including three men from El Salvador sought in connection with gang killings. Immigration agents have conducted many roundups of drug traffickers and human smugglers.At the same time, a 19-year-old migrant from Honduras, Wildin Acosta, was still being held in an immigration detention center in Lumpkin, Ga., five months after he was arrested when he was heading to high school in Durham, N.C.In 2014, Mr. Acosta crossed the border illegally and turned himself in to border agents, asking for asylum. Since he was 17 at the time and traveling without his parents, he was held under special protections for unaccompanied minors. He was sent to live with his parents, who had settled years before in Durham.He started going to high school, made friends who helped him learn English and joined a local soccer league. He presented a formal request for asylum in the United States, saying in legal papers that he fled Honduras after two close relatives were murdered.But he missed a date in immigration court and a judge ordered him deported. Mr. Acosta also turned 19, making him too old, immigration officials said, to be given deference as a minor.Mr. Acosta was among dozens of teenagers as well as mothers and smaller children from Central America who were arrested in an operation by immigration agents over one weekend in late January. Homeland Security Department officials said that because of his recent border crossing, Mr. Acosta was among the highest priorities for deportation.The arrests caused panic in immigrant communities in Durham. Teachers, lawmakers and community leaders mobilized to protest. Mr. Acostas lawyer, Evelyn Smallwood, has forestalled his deportation but has not secured his release.He is a good kid, and he is doing everything he can to keep his sanity, she said. The administration has said it is as important to remove Wildin as it is to remove a drug trafficker or a terrorist."}

Would it matter if one of the pedestrians was a baby? If one of them was old or very attractive or very overweight?It is, to say the least, an unpalatable choice. Now imagine programming a robotic vehicle to make the choice. What would you tell it to do?For the engineers working on self-driving cars, this is more than just an intellectual puzzle. It is a decision they will eventually have to program into their machines.A new article in the magazine Science tried to determine what consumers would expect their autonomous vehicles to do. Not surprisingly, people told researchers they want machines that would try to save the greatest number of people.But there was a caveat: Those surveyed also indicated that if they were actually in the self-driving vehicle, theyd appreciate it if the machine tried to save them first.Whats the solution? A set of government requirements for autonomous car morality might be one way to go, though the people surveyed in the Science article say they are not keen on that. Manufacturers could also tailor morality to a buyers choice. Some might be selfless. Others? Not so much.Can you teach a machine what the right thing to do is? First, humans would have to agree."}
{"text": " Britains exit from the European Union shocked global markets. The pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985. Investors fled risky assets and turned to the dollar and the yen. The vote could be a sign that major democracies are vulnerable to the influence of populist political movements.LONDON  No one really knows what happens now. The collective imagination leads to dark places.The world map has been redrawn with the rules of commerce across Europe, the largest marketplace on earth. Britains vote on Thursday to leave the European Union has set in motion an unprecedented and unpredictable process that threatens turbulence and potential crisis  for Britain, for Europe and for the global economy.Of most immediate consequence, Britains vote to leave Europe sent global markets on a wild descent. Investors gaped at this major refashioning of the global landscape and decided it looked perilous  or at least so pockmarked with uncertainty that they preferred to pull their money out of riskier corners like stock markets.Few expect that Britains departure from Europe will set off a full financial crisis like the one seen after the collapse of the investment banking giant Lehman Brothers in 2008.But no one knows enough to rule that out, either. The world has never been here before.The pound plummeted, reaching depths not seen since 1985  well below the value at the worst of the 2008 financial crisis. The euro dropped.From Tokyo to London to New York, stocks tumbled sharply on Friday, as markets digested the changing world order. American shares were down 3.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 611 points, its biggest drop since August.British stocks were off 3.2 percent, while broader European shares dropped 8.6 percent.Investors took refuge in the safest investments, bolstering the value of American government debt and the Japanese currency.Less than an hour after the markets opened in London, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, stood in front of television cameras to announce that the central bank had earmarked 250 billion pounds, about $344 billion, to unleash as needed for stability. Stock markets took some solace, paring back their losses for the day.Whatever happens, a long, confusing period now unfolding seems certain to yank Europe back into acute anxiety just as it seemed to be finally recovering from a punishing economic downturn, one that had thrust Greece and Spain into veritable depressions while erasing years of wealth across the Continent.The vote to leave, a so-called Brexit, raised the prospect of sustained anxiety in the global economy as investors struggle to surmise what is happening.China, the worlds second-largest economy, behind that of the United States, is slowing significantly, and the markets have little faith in the data provided by its Communist Party government. Brazil, once a darling among emerging markets, is in full-blown crisis. Europe and its common market, home to 500 million people, have been plunged into turmoil, their prospects difficult to divine.Markets crave known facts and fret about variables, seeing potential risks in all unknowns. An enormous portion of the map is now draped in uncertainty, effectively impervious to calculation.The vote appears likely to prompt multinational banks to shift significant numbers of jobs from Britain to competing financial centers in the European Union, led by Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam. Many experts assume Brussels will move quickly to restrict trading of euro-denominated assets  a major business for Britain. Prominent banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup warned during the campaign that an exit would cause them to transfer some operations elsewhere.As investors pulled back in fear on Friday, entrusting their money only to the safest places like United States Treasuries, the moves appeared to foreshadow a tightening of credit for many. Emerging markets may find it difficult to secure investment, limiting economic growth. Borrowing costs are likely to rise in heavily indebted nations, including Greece, Italy and Portugal, as investors demand extra inducements to put their money in riskier locales.The Bank of England may have to raise interest rates to halt a plunge in the pound, the opposite from the usual playbook when an economy suffers a shock.Most broadly, the vote is likely to resonate as a sign that major democracies are increasingly vulnerable to the influence of populist political movements that curry favor by demonizing immigrants and external forces such as officials in Brussels and Washington, low-wage workers in China and Mexico.The noisy and acrimonious campaign over leaving the bloc played on inchoate fears in Europe and much of the developed world: dismay over globalization at a time of intensified competition for jobs, and angst over immigration as it refashions conceptions of national identity. Those sentiments will surely find additional avenues for expression, challenging trade arrangements, reinvigorating existential questions about the shared euro currency and sowing uncertainty throughout the financial realm.Economists and political analysts have been watching the campaign as a gauge of the potency of anti-immigrant sentiments far beyond Britain. The success of the movement to leave the bloc is likely to resonate in financial markets as cause to assume a higher probability that Donald J. Trump will be elected president of the United States, riding his pledges to bar Muslim immigrants and erect a wall along the Mexican border.Given Mr. Trumps talk of renouncing trade agreements and renegotiating the terms of American debt, investors are likely to take rising odds of his election as impetus to limit their exposure to risk, eschewing stock markets and plowing funds into the safest forms of government debt.The vote in Britain was essentially against economic rationality and driven by identity concerns and unease about globalization and trade, said Nicolas Vron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels. If such a vote can win in the U.K., that fosters among investors a sense of the likelihood that Trump can also win, and that will have an adverse effect on capital markets.Not least, the vote unleashes considerable forces of uncertainty.Though the vote changes nothing for at least two years, it kicks off what are certain to be complex and politically fraught negotiations between Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union over their future dealings.Central to these talks is the future of Europes common market, which allows goods and services to be traded freely throughout its vast territory. Given that Britain sells almost half of its exports in the common market, and given that many multinational companies have forged bases in Britain as a means of serving customers across the Continent, any impediment is likely to be expensive.Disruption to trade was a major assumption in many academic studies released during the campaign that almost universally forecast substantial and potentially lasting damage to the British economy should Britain opt to leave Europe.During the campaign, those supporting an exit emphasized that Britain would remain in the common market during the negotiating period. They assured voters that Britain would strike a more beneficial trade deal.But prominent leaders  not least, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany  warned that a jilted European Union would be in no mood to extend Britain a rewarding deal, lest other malcontent members take encouragement to go for the exits.If no deal is struck, the rules of the World Trade Organization could apply. They give member nations the rights to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports, raising the possibility of a tit-for-tat trade skirmish between Britain and the Continent.In the meantime, the lack of clarity is likely to damage economic growth in Britain and beyond.You get a rabbit-in-the-headlights phenomenon where businesses dont want to make new decisions, or new investments, because they are uncertain about the future, said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The immediate effect will be a lowering of investment activity, a lowering of hiring. There will an immediate slowdown of growth.The success of the campaign to leave deals a formidable blow to an already weakened European Union and heightens the likelihood that fresh separatist movements will emerge. Scotland will almost certainly seek to separate itself from Britain after a failed referendum two years ago. In the Netherlands, France, Hungary and Italy, the success of the campaign could increase the intensity of so-called euroskeptic parties.For Europe, it raises the markets perception of breakup risk, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.If another euro crisis emerges, Europe may lack the political cohesion to address it. Further separatism could fragment the common market, bringing the demise of the six-decade-old project of European integration. Few now expect that to occur. But whatever the risks were before, Britain just increased them.At some point, you wonder how many blows a body can take, Mr. Van Reenen said. I dont think this will happen, but theres this risk that everything will fall apart."}
{"text": "LONDON  As the bands played on at the Glastonbury music festival in Somerset, England, Lewis Phillips and his friends drowned their sorrows in song and alcohol.Were the ones whove got to live with it for a long time, but a group of pensioners have managed to make a decision for us, Mr. Phillips, 27, said on Friday of Britains decision to withdraw from the European Union. He said he was now terrified about the countrys economic prospects.Louise Driscoll, a 21-year-old barista in London, spent most of the day crying. I had a bad feeling in my gut, she said of Britains referendum on Europe. What do we do now? Im very scared. Her parents both voted to leave the bloc, she said, and will probably be gloating.The vote to leave the European Union exposed tensions and fault lines in British society, but perhaps none more  gaping than its generational divisions.According to pre-election surveys by the polling organization Survation, 57 percent of Britons between the ages of 18 and 34 who intended to take part in Thursdays referendum supported remaining in the bloc, while an identical proportion  57 percent  of Britons over 55 supported the opposite: leaving Europe behind.For those under 25, the desire to remain in the union was especially high: Three-quarters wanted Britain to stay in Europe.Many young people in Britain have grown up thinking of European integration as a given, not a political experiment that would be rolled back before they could fully take part in it.They are often more comfortable living in a multicultural society than their elders are, particularly in cities like London and Edinburgh, which are flooded by people from across the Continent to study and work.Many young Britons expressed astonishment, anger or despair that their parents and grandparents would seek to limit the travel, exposure to other cultures and opportunities to work and study abroad that being part of the European Union has afforded them.Truly gutted that our grandparents have effectively decided that they hate foreigners more than they love us and our futures, one young Briton, Dan Boden, wrote on Twitter.The referendum hinged in part on youth turnout, and the government even tried to lower the voting age for the referendum to 16 from 18.It failed, but the Remain campaign still pushed to register young voters, with some success: The deadline to register was extended by two days after a voter-registration website crashed because it was overwhelmed by visitors.Prime Minister David Cameron turned to Tinder, the dating app, and TheLADbible, a website popular among young men, to tout the benefits of staying in the European Union. The opposition Labour Party, which supported remaining in the bloc, also reached out to young voters.More than one million people between 18 and 34 registered in recent months, the most ever for a British election, according to Bite the Ballot and HOPE Not Hate, which encourage young people to vote. Turnout for the referendum, at around 72 percent, was the highest for any national election in Britain since 1992.But it was not enough.Waking up to the #EURefResults and realizing the older generation have just ruined our future, one young Briton, Toby Pickard, wrote on Twitter.Another, Sarah Hartley, wrote that our economy is in tatters because our grandparents cared more about their comfort than our future.In Edinburgh, a university city with a strongly pro-European bent, Robert Jack, a 21-year-old student at the University of Glasgow, was reeling from the decision. He worried that his plans to study in Romania on the European Unions student-exchange program, Erasmus, were in jeopardy.The vote is very damaging, Mr. Jack said, adding that he now welcomed a second referendum on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom, because its better being inside the European Union.Of course, many young people supported the push to rid themselves of Europe. Ben Kew, 21, said he spent 30 hours at the Leave headquarters, watching the results come in.I was surprised; I didnt think wed go through with it, but Im pleased that the establishment has been given a kick, he said, adding that the vote was a moment when Britons expressed a desire for real change.But many young voters wondered what would happen to European Union funding for research and sciences. British universities currently receive about 16 percent of their research money and staff members from the European Union.James Calderbank, 21, a student at Falmouth University in Cornwall, England, wrote in an email: Since the early hours of this morning my Facebook newsfeed has been filled with my friends disappointment that we are leaving the E.U.He added: Our campus was part-funded by the E.U., so things are really not looking good for my university and its source of funds. Cornwall, as a fairly rural and less-developed part of southwest England, was also a beneficiary of economic aid from Brussels, he noted.Some high-school students expressed dismay as well. There is a very clear rift between how us young people feel and how the oldest age groups feel, Elliot Shirnia, 18, a student at the Marling School in Gloucestershire, England, wrote in an email, adding that as the son of a refugee from Iran he felt the Leave campaign was divisive.Anxiety about the economy and immigration drove the Leave campaigns victory. But many young people said they thought the decision would only set back their prospects.Im already part of a generation stuck in rented property unable to buy my own house, Hannah Shaw, 25, who works at a National Health Service hospital and lives with her parents, wrote in an email. The older generation seem so happy with the result, almost smug like its some sort of victory completely unaware of the chaos theyve caused for my generation. Im dreading what will happen to employment, workers rights, the environment and our economy.She added that she had friends from countries like Slovakia, Poland, Spain and Romania.Its hard to see it affect them and think of the amazing people Ill never meet after we leave the E.U., she said. The U.K. suddenly feels very small.Ms. Shaw blamed the news media for spreading misinformation about European Union membership. A lot of the older generation rely on newspapers for all their facts and dont actually do any of their own research unlike my generation.Jenna Ives-Moody, 19, a journalism student at the University of Huddersfield in northern England, wrote in an email that serious fact-based journalism within the U.K. is not valued by the majority of the English population.She said the Leave campaign was driven by a misplaced ideal of reclaiming former glories within Britain, which she said was not common among young people who embrace all aspects of being European.Fear was palpable among the young people in London who have thronged the capital from elsewhere in Europe.Francisco Vicedo, a 22-year-old Spaniard who works at a branch of the fast-food chain Pret a Manger, is studying for a masters program on organized crime and terrorism at University College London.Weve already sent money to our countries because we know that in the following days the value of the pound is going to be down, he said. Everyone is sending money already.He said he hoped to stay in London, where job opportunities are more plentiful than in Spain, but was unsure of his prospects.Dara Canavan, 23, who works at a management consultancy, comes from an Irish town just across the border from Northern Ireland, and expressed fear about the possible reimposition of border controls.There is a lot of worry about whether free control between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be affected, said Mr. Canavan.Mr. Canavan wasnt sure he would stay in Britain. I was thinking of going back in the future, but this could speed up the process, he said."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re British Stun World With Vote to Leave E.U. (front page, June 24):As a British citizen living in New York City, I see the future as uncertain at best, and bleak at worst. It has been hard through the first half of this year  coddled as I am by my Democratic-leaning surroundings and Labour-leaning Facebook feed  to believe that either of two things could happen: Donald Trump winning the presidency, or Britain leaving the European Union. I was proved wrong in Thursdays referendum, and my confidence that America would not, in the end, elect Mr. Trump has been shaken.A vote for Leave was a vote for increased sovereignty, certainly, but also for a nationalism that we can ill afford in a time of increasing polarization, and that legitimizes and encourages the same elsewhere.Being part of the European Union has brought Britain closer to the other nations of Europe, and also to the rest of the world. It has widened our focus and our expectations, encouraging  and sometimes compelling  us to meet and accustom ourselves to difference to a degree that is not possible in Britain alone.Leaving will mean a contraction of ambition and empathy. Perhaps it reflects a desire for just that. But its a loss that I feel deeply, and that I think leaves our world worse off than before, both in the decision itself and the precedent it sets.FERGUS McINTOSHBrooklynTo the Editor:While polling showed a close race in recent weeks, the news that Britain has voted to exit the European Union still comes as a shock and surprise. Alas, I cant help feeling that the vote was based on bigotry toward immigrants.David Cameron has announced that he plans to step down by the fall, which opens the door perhaps for Boris Johnson to be the prime minister. The future is unknown and unsettled, but those of us who are Anglophiles and love the United Kingdom will hope for the best  especially as the British peoples decision could affect the rest of the world.JENNIFER DORNNew YorkTo the Editor:Could I thank President Obama for coming to Britain and telling us to vote Remain? His exhortations, along with those of other foreign politicians, multimillionaire businessmen and bankers, helped persuade the British people that the wealthy Davos elite was interested in keeping Britain in the European Union for its own political and commercial reasons rather than for the good of the Brits.No American would tolerate being governed by a group of unelected bureaucrats with laws imposed on them by politicians of other countries. That is why we voted for Leave. The United Kingdom has now become a free, independent nation once again, and we will continue to work and trade with the whole world.We are pleased that, after the Brexit victory, President Obama said, The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States, which is a welcome change from his comments when he visited here that if we voted to leave, then we would be at the end of the queue to get a trade deal.DAVID BLENCATHRALondonThe writer, a former member of Parliament, is now a Conservative member of the House of Lords.To the Editor:It is perhaps not surprising that England, the birthplace of the Luddite movement, the group attempting to negate the social and economic disruption of the Industrial Revolution, voted to leave the European Union. After all, the emotions animating Brexit are very similar to those of their brethren two centuries ago: fear of rapid technological change, an uncertain future and, of course, the foreign other.But history has shown how unwise and wrong that view was. Nevertheless, we should not ignore the desperation and anguish of those who fear for their way of life and a threatened future. I hope that imprudent and isolationist sentiments do not have similar disastrous effects here in America.PHILIP M. ROSOFFDurham, N.C.To the Editor:I think Thomas Jefferson would be very proud of the people of Great Britain, for as he said, A little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical. And with 72 percent of the British electorate voting, I feel that Jefferson would be doubly happy knowing that the citizens of Great Britain took their civic duties seriously.Whether or not this is the right decision, only time will tell. But this historic vote demonstrated to the world that democracy does work  that through civil public discourse the body politic at large can make a well-informed collective decision that all parties can recognize as fair and just.NEIL J. BLUMGlenview, Ill.To the Editor:Dear Brits: We Americans want to congratulate you on your vote to exit the modern world. Now that your prime minister is resigning, you need a brave new leader who can Make Britain Great Again (ca. 1775?).We have just the man for you: He will round up all those pesky immigrants, hell negotiate unbelievably good deals with those trading partners you just shoved off, and in a pinch hell rebuild Hadrians Wall.Quite frankly, we would appreciate if you could take him off our hands. Youre welcome to Donald Trump!SEBASTIAN KUHNNorfolk, Va."}
{"text": "Lets criticize cruise ships.I know, I know. Things are bad enough without going negative about your summer vacation. But weve got some problems here. Plus, I promise there will be a penguin.The cruise industry seems to be exploding  the newest generation of ships can carry more than 5,000 passengers. They make a great deal of profit from the sale of alcohol, so imagine the equivalent of a small city whose inhabitants are perpetually drunk.Really, these things are so huge, its amazing they can stay afloat without toppling over. And when one is parked outside, say, Venice, the effect is like one of those alien-invasion movies, when people wake up and find that a spaceship the size of Toledo has landed downtown. (Venetians also claim the ships are causing waves in their canals.) Environmentalists wring their hands over the air pollution and sewage  a 3,000-passenger ship, which today would rank as medium-size, produces 21,000 gallons of sewage a day, sometimes treated and sometimes not so much. But always pumped into the sea.And, as long as were complaining, lets point out that noise from the ships is messing with the whales. Michael Jasny of the Natural Resources Defense Council says cruises en route to Alaska routinely drown out the calls of the endangered orcas trying to communicate. The NRDC has a new film, Sonic Sea, that features audio of a whale conversation being obliterated by an approaching cruise ship. The effect is sort of like what youd experience if you were having a meaningful chat with friends on the patio and a trailer-tractor full of disco dancers suddenly drove into the back yard.Thanks to global warming, cruise lines will soon be able to sail the Northwest Passage, so the Arctic will have both more melting ice and more 13-deck ships. Antarctica hosted 30,000 visitors last year. Doesnt that seem like a lot for such a fragile place? Also, an opera singer who was entertaining passengers on one cruise went ashore to sing O Sole Mio and caused a penguin stampede. This is not really a problem you need to worry about, but it was a pretty interesting moment.While many of the biggest cruise lines appear to be headquartered in Florida, they are, for tax purposes, actually proud residents of  elsewhere. Carnival is a Panamanian corporation; Royal Caribbean is Liberian, said Ross Klein, who tracks the industry through his Cruise Junkie website.Although, of course, if one of the ships needs help, it will often be the American taxpayer-funded Coast Guard that comes to the rescue. The Coast Guard doesnt charge for its services, a spokesman said, because we dont want people to hesitate to summon help when passengers are in danger. This attitude is commendable. But the no-taxes part is not.Cruise lines do pay taxes, protested a spokesman for the industry, counting off a number of levies for things like customs, and examination of animals and plants being brought into the country. Not the same thing.Were constantly hearing complaints in Congress about American companies that relocate their headquarters overseas for tax avoidance. But when do you hear anybody mentioning the cruise industrys Panamanian connection? The cruise companies may not really live here, but they certainly can lobby here.Powerful is an understatement, said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Hes the sponsor of a bill that would increase consumer protection for cruise passengers. The bill, which cant even get a committee hearing, would also require the ships to have up-to-date technology that detects when passengers fall overboard. Now this would seem like something youd expect them to have around.An average of about 20 people fall off cruise ships every year, which the industry points out is only about one in a million travelers. But still, I suspect that passengers work under the assumption that if they do somehow wind up in the water, someone will notice. This spring, a 33-year-old American woman disappeared during a cruise in the Gulf of Mexico. No one realized she was gone for 10 hours, and by the time searchers could start looking for her, the area they needed to cover was more than 4,000 square miles. While its the least thing anyone worries about when a person is missing at sea, let us point out once again that it was the taxpayer-funded Coast Guard doing the searching.The cruise industry says the overboard technology hasnt been perfected. Blumenthal says its been well tested. Seems like the sort of disagreement that would be easy to resolve with  a committee hearing.Most cruise vacationers seem to enjoy their experience  the industry says nearly 90 percent declare themselves satisfied. Its not our business to get in between anybody and an ocean breeze. Our requests are modest, really: Make the cruise ship companies that are, for all practical purposes, American pay American taxes. Leave the whales alone. Give that bill a committee hearing. And stop scaring the penguins."}
{"text": "A super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton will begin a $10.5 million advertising blitz in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state that Donald J. Trump is seeking to win by appealing to white working-class voters.The wave of spending will begin on July 5 and run through Election Day, in the markets around Philadelphia, Scranton and Pittsburgh. The ad campaign brings the full amount that the PAC, Priorities USA, has reserved on television against Mr. Trump to $117.5 million, according to the groups spokesman, Justin Barasky.This morning Donald Trump cheered a potential economic collapse because it would be good for his bottom line and compared running a country to running a golf course, Mr. Barasky said, adding that the group was determined to keep him from becoming president.With Pennsylvania added to its list, Priorities will be advertising in nine states. Mr. Trump has yet to air a general election ad, and the super PACs supporting him have not been running spots in battleground states."}

{"text": "You dont hear many people bellyaching about the servant problem these days.In 1904, when Saki wrote, The cook was a good cook, as cooks go, and as cooks go, she went, this lapidary witticism would have fallen on kind ears. The bourgeoisie of that era talked about the unreliability of hired help with the same willed petulance that we reserve today for conversations about how it takes three remotes to turn on our TV.Indeed, in todays world, it seems as if youd be less likely to hear about a domestic walking out than you would someone falling in love with his virtual assistant.I recently used a virtual assistant named Amy for 10 days. We did not fall in love, but I should point out that Amy is underage because she is still in beta. (Id say shes about a teenager now, Amys representative told me. Which means occasionally moody and incorrigible.)My relationship with Amy was less Lord Grantham/the housemaid Jane than the sorcerers apprentice/his bucket.Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Now and Cortana have helped many people navigate their lives, but the next wave of helpers is likely to have more agency.Hailing from a New York start-up called x.ai, Amy (who users can alternatively name Andrew) will set up meetings for you. Once someone has agreed to meet with you at a certain place, you cc Amy, and independently of you shell go back and forth with the other person to determine a mutually convenient time, and then help you to put that time on your calendar.Winningly, Amy is (for now) free. Once her users sign up on the x.ai website, they need tangle with neither hardware nor app.The best part of having a virtual assistant is telling your friends you have a virtual assistant; I felt as if Id discovered a third buttock.It was the conversational equivalent of carrying a baby through an office. Does she sound like Scarlett Johansson in Her?, one person asked me; another jested that bots are the new mimes.Allowing someone to do your vetting requires trust. I applaud x.ai for including, at the bottom of each of Amys emails, the information that Amy Ingram is a form of artificial intelligence; if my correspondents had twigged to this fact on their own, they might have felt like Mia Farrow in Rosemarys Baby.Additionally, I loved that Amy sent me copies of all her correspondence for the first three meetings she set up for me. It was reassuring that Amy did not not deploy the locutions No problem or its hideous offspring N.P.But the more I used Amy, the more I saw that she can be relied on for finding a mutually convenient time between parties, but not much more.When I told one friend to meet me at the Starbucks near Bond Street, Amy provided the address for the wrong Starbucks; one afternoon when I invited my boyfriend, Greg, to the admittedly vague location the beach in August, I came home that night to six emails from Amy.Stranger yet, when Amy sends confirmation of a meeting, her list of the meetings attendees includes herself, so apparently Amy will join Greg and I at the beach. Hawt.It also intrigued me that I maintained decorum with Amy (lots of Thanks and Great) even though I didnt have to. As one fellow x.ai user put it: It would actually take more energy to stop myself from being civil. Theres an energetic cost to being rude or neutral or bleh.I wanted to test Amy with some of the vagaries that sometimes befall get-togethers. My own friends and colleagues are, of course, far, far too drenched in integrity and follow-through ever to exhibit even the tiniest glimmer of unreliability or waffling, so I created an email account for someone I called Tania.I imagined Tania to be an impulsive, scatterbrained entertainer for children. When Amy extended to Tania an invitation for coffee at Starbucks, I had Tania write back to Amy: I can do 3:00 on Monday, unless I only get 3 hours of sleep that night and look smeary and indistinct and have trouble following the thread of conversations. In which case Thursday or Friday are much better.Amy blithely set the appointment for Monday at 3:00, not telling me about Tanias pre-emptive waffle. Oops.Next, on the morning of the coffee date, I had Tania write Amy, Im working a kids birthday party directly after I meet Henry. Do you think it will be O.K. if I bring a suitcase full of baby animals to Starbucks?Amy forwarded me the email, saying she didnt think she could answer it, and then told Tania she had done so, encouraging Tania to get in touch with me directly if Tania didnt hear from me. Well done.Finally, 16 minutes before Tanias and my supposed appointment, I had Tania write Amy to say that she was running 15 minutes late: A bottle of moisturizer has exploded and I am beset with goo. Amy nimbly forwarded the message to me minutes later. Nice.The one person in my life whom I was loath to sic Amy on was my former part-time assistant Ryan, whom I had to let go a few months ago because of budgetary downsizing.Without using Amy, I asked Ryan to meet me for lunch at a cafe in the West Village, where I unbosomed the sordid news that I had taken on a virtual assistant. Ryan let out a mock gasp and tucked into his steamed vegetables.I said, I brought you to a restaurant to tell you this so you wouldnt cry. He thanked me for my sensitivity. I added, I know how hard a time this is in the arts, job wise, for straight white boys. He readdressed his vegetables. I paid for lunch to assuage my guilt.The strangest moment Ive had with Amy, though, came when I had her set up an appointment for a phone interview with an x.ai employee who also uses the companys virtual assistant  in this case, Andrew  for making appointments.After Amy and Andrew had set up the appointment, I asked Amy why I didnt see the appointment on my calendar; strangely, she wrote back as Andrew. I thought, not only is my assistant invisible, unpredictable, occasionally moody, and incorrigible  she is also trans.In the end, working with Amy has made me think about assistantship. Besides the nuts-and-bolts of completing tasks efficiently, what are we looking for in our helpers? Reassurance? A second opinion? All our best qualities narcissistically reflected back at us?I want all of these, as well as someone who will smile or laugh the fifth time I refer to vegans as vegsbians, not to mention someone who can tell me whether or not the kids are still wearing bonnets in Williamsburg, and whether youre meant to store your Skrillex alongside your hammer and your pliers, or alongside your vibrator and your lubricant.All of these skills elude my simple Amy. But Amy has one thing going for her that youre unlikely to see from any of her living, breathing counterparts: on Monday morning, Amy sends me a summary of my meetings for the week. But when I say Monday morning, I dont mean at 8:23 a.m., as shes groggily lumbering onto the L train at the Bedford stop. I mean at 3:47 a.m.It was hugely consoling to learn that my helper was thoroughly invested in my schedule at an hour when my bladder is making a lot of troubling decisions for me. Indeed, reading the time code 3.47 a.m. made me feel as if I was looking at one of those webby holographic depictions of tissue being regenerated on the Bionic Mans body.In her present state, Amy may not be able to do much beyond reduce the number of emails that lie between you and the awkward meeting at the Doppio Hut where you and your regional buyer ask each other if youre taking any vacation days this summer. But we have the technology. We can rebuild her."}
{"text": "The weakest first-time eligible group in decades has left the doors open to the Hockey Hall of Fame for several players who have been awaiting the call.Eric Lindros has been waiting six years, Mark Recchi three, Dave Andreychuk eight and Sergei Makarov 16. This could finally be the year as the Hall of Fame selection committee determines the class of 2016 on Monday.Goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, defenseman Roman Hamrlik and forwards Milan Hejduk and Vinny Prospal headline the first-year eligible players.Lindross case is the most polarizing because he was one of the most dominant players in the world while playing for the Philadelphia Flyers during the 1990s, but his career was cut short by injuries.Lindros won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the N.H.L.s most valuable player in 1995, led the Flyers to the 1997 Stanley Cup finals and had a career average of more than a point a game during the regular season and the playoffs.Concussions and other injuries limited him to 760 regular-season games, so his 372 goals, 493 assists and 865 points do not jump off the page. But Lindross mix of skill, production and physicality is unique in the history of the game.He shouldve been one of the greatest players of all time, Lindross former teammate Rod BrindAmour said. Injuries kind of, I think, slowed him down and kind of ended what shouldve been a Hall of Fame career.Every skater except Lindros who has been an M.V.P. since 1945 is in the Hall of Fame. The 18-member committee values winning and longevity, but Pavel Bure and Cam Neely were inducted with fewer games played and fewer points, and like Lindros, neither got his name on the Stanley Cup.Lindros rubbed the hockey establishment the wrong way when he first refused to sign with the junior team that drafted him and then refused to sign with the Quebec Nordiques when they selected him first over all in 1991.In a blockbuster deal that included the future Hall of Famer Peter Forsberg as part of the return, the Nordiques traded him to Philadelphia. He endured tumultuous times off the ice, notably an icy relationship with Philadelphia General Manager Bobby Clarke, who feuded with Lindross parents and stripped him of the captaincy.But Clarke is now on the selection committee and is a strong proponent for Lindross enshrinement in Toronto.Ron Hextall, who was also part of that trade, argued that Lindros would have won two championships, as Forsberg did, if he had been on the team that moved from Quebec to Colorado.Here are the cases for several other potential members of the class of 2016:MARK RECCHI The productive winger won the Cup three times with three different teams (the Penguins, the Hurricanes and the Bruins) and put up 577 goals and 956 assists for 1,533 points in 22 N.H.L. seasons. BrindAmour said of Recchi, I dont know what more you need to do to be a Hall of Fame player.SERGEI MAKAROV His 384 N.H.L. points and a Calder Trophy season as rookie of the year must be combined with his dominant international career for the Soviet Union, in which Makarov averaged 1.37 points a game and won two Olympic gold medals and eight world championships.DAVE ANDREYCHUK The captain of the 2004 Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning put up 1,338 points in 1,639 regular-season games in 23 seasons.ALEXANDER MOGILNY Second only to the 2015 inductee Sergei Fedorov in N.H.L. points among Russians, with 1,032, Mogilny won the Cup with the Devils and was a six-time All-Star in 16 seasons.PAUL KARIYA Like Lindros, concussions cut Kariyas career short, but he finished with 989 points in 989 games over 15 seasons and made the All-Star Game seven times.JEREMY ROENICK His 1,216 points rank him fourth among American players, and the top three  Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Phil Housley  are all in.CURTIS JOSEPH Not winning a Cup hurts a goalie, but his 454 victories are the most of any not in the Hall.ROD BRINDAMOUR He was the captain of the 2006 Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes, had 1,184 points and won the Frank J. Selke Trophy twice as the top defensive forward.THEO FLEURY He overcame his 5-foot-6 size to put up 1,088 points and win almost everything: the Stanley Cup, the Canada Cup, an Olympic gold medal and a world junior gold medal.CHRIS OSGOOD Won the Cup twice as a starting goalie and again as a backup but benefited from playing on the talented Detroit Red Wings teams."}
{"text": "Few nuclear power plants have been as contentious as Diablo Canyon. The plant, which went online in 1985 after years of ferocious opposition, sits on a gorgeous stretch of California coastline, surrounded by several earthquake faults and reliably producing enormous quantities of power  almost a tenth of Californias in-state generation. It also reliably kills enormous quantities of marine life with a cooling system that depends on huge intakes and discharges of seawater. David Brower, the executive director of the Sierra Club, got so angry with the organization when it refused to oppose the plant that he left to establish Friends of the Earth.Mr. Brower, who died in 2000, would have been pleased with last weeks news. After long negotiations that involved, among others, Friends of the Earth and the Natural Resources Defense Council, the plants owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, announced that it would shut down Diablo Canyon when licenses for its two reactors expire in 2024 and 2025 and that it would replace the power with lower-cost, zero-carbon energy sources.Approvals will be needed from two state agencies, the California State Lands Commission and the states Public Utilities Commission. Both should say yes; this is an event of potentially great significance for the future of energy generation in this country and for the health of the earth itself  and not just because a bunch of sometimes quarrelsome forces (unions, environmental groups, the power company) came together to make it happen.First, the agreement is a recognition by PG&E, which generates a big chunk of its electrical output (and revenues) from Diablo Canyon, that it can provide the same amount of energy at lower costs by investing in wind and solar power and in energy efficiency improvements throughout the system, including its customers. As one negotiator put it, the deal is further evidence that the age of renewables has arrived  at least in California, which has long led the nation in energy innovation and last year passed a law requiring state-regulated utilities to get half their electricity from renewable sources by 2030.Equally important, the agreement could serve as a positive example for other states and nations that may in time need to replace aging nuclear plants without increasing carbon emissions. However old and creaky some of them may be, Americas 99 nuclear reactors produce nearly a fifth of the nations power and two-thirds of its low-carbon energy; at a time of mounting fears about climate change, the country would be foolish to shut them down prematurely. When the time comes to retire them, it would be no less foolish to replace their power with anything other than zero-carbon sources like wind, or solar or energy efficiency.One governor who understands this is New Yorks Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo has proposed an ambitious clean-energy agenda that includes not only substantial investments in wind and solar power, but also subsidies to keep open several upstate nuclear plants that are at risk of closing because of low electricity prices driven by cheap natural gas.Mr. Cuomo would be happy to close down the Indian Point plant, north of New York City. Indian Point has a terrible track record and last week was forced to shut down one reactor. But losing the upstate plants, he argues, would mean increased reliance on fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas emissions they generate until the day when renewables kick in. A similar drama is playing out in Illinois, where Exelon, a big power producer, has threatened to close down two money-losing nuclear plants unless it gets help from the Illinois legislature.From a climate perspective, the smart strategy in such cases would be to hold on to the nuclear plants until a California-like transition to greenhouse-gas-free electricity is feasible. Not every state has Californias natural blessings, or its aggressive renewable energy mandates. But its commitment and imagination are worth emulating."}

{"text": "ON THE RIVER MAULLN, Chile  Eight thousand miles is a long way to go to catch a trout. But there I was, balancing precariously in a boat on a river in Chile, having my first lesson in fly-fishing. The tranquillity of the scene was disturbed only by the gurgling of the water and the murmured instructions of my teacher. And my noisy flailing about as I tried to keep my balance while standing up in the boat.It had long been my ambition to go fly-fishing. It seemed to be a clever game of aqueous cat and mouse alluringly set in tumbling rivers or by the still waters of a mountain lake. But where to go? There are trout lakes less than an hours drive from my home in London, but that lacks romance. New Zealand? Canada? Both popular with the fishing fraternity. I chose Chile, that intriguing stiletto of a country 2,653 miles long and an average of 110 miles wide, with inhospitable deserts to the north; vineyards, lakes and rivers in the middle; and to the south, mighty mountains and glaciers.We stayed in the capital for three days  long enough for my wife to fracture her ankle on one of Santiagos rugged sidewalks  before driving south to the Lake District on our way to our destination, the Maulln River near the port city of Puerto Montt. We flew the 430 miles to the city of Temuco, hired a tank of a Toyota and set off on a modest road trip.Some of the journey was on rutted dirt roads, up and down forested mountainsides in a cloud of dust. The rest was on asphalt alongside lakes and rivers with exotic names such as Panguipulli and Riihue, given to them by the Mapuche tribes who lived in the area until the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. And all against the backdrop of the Andes and some of the countrys 2,000 volcanoes. The lakeside resort towns are distinctly Teutonic, with timber houses and twin-spired churches, a reminder that the area was settled by thousands of Germans in the mid-19th century. (Their other legacy is kchen, cakes stuffed with fruit and walnuts.)Then came the fishing. I headed for the Senda Nativa Romahue, a private nature reserve on the banks of the Maulln that had been recommended by a local tour operator, 20 dusty miles from the hotel. There I met Claudio Redlich, my fishing tutor, keen-eyed, sure of touch, skills honed by 35 years of experience.In my minds eye I had seen myself in chest-high waders, straining against a raging torrent. But no. We went to a small lagoon  actually more of a big pond  surrounded by thick trees, like a mangrove swamp. Was it what I had come all this way for? Even to an absolute beginner, the spot looked tame.But Mr. Redlich unhitched the boat and poled us toward the low-lying forest that surrounds the pond. A gap little wider than the boat materialized, allowing us to glide silently along through a tunnel of trees.He explained that the Maulln flows on a glacial murrain so the trees float on the water in a dense mass. If you were to fly over the area, the Chilean myrtles would look like a solid undergrowth, their fragrant white flowers contrasting with the red petals of a parasite creeper called the medalitta.We emerged into what appeared to be another lagoon but was actually the fast-moving Maulln on its way from its source, Lake Llanquihue, to the Pacific about 80 miles west.Mr. Redlich spared me any complex discussion about fishing rods  short rods are used on small rivers, larger ones on big lakes, for example  but he did explain the science of the fly.Each one has to look like and behave like an insect, something the fish would eat. Some flies are used with a heavier line so they sink to attract low-swimming fish, others float lightly on the waters surface. He rummaged in a tin of many-hued feathered lures and chose the Simulator, with its reddish body and straw-colored spikes.He set me up with a Streamer, which has dashes of orange and red, and, he assured me, would prove irresistible to the brown and rainbow trout lurking beneath the surface.Thats the science; what about casting? Watch me, he instructed and sent his line floating off effortlessly in a clean, gliding action that landed the fly 30 or 40 feet away. Just where he intended. He caught a trout, of course, with his second cast.I tried, swaying uncertainly in the boat, worried that my casting would take out someones eye. My attempt ended in an untidy swirl of line that tangled in the air and flopped onto the water, where it floated limply.Dont flick your wrist, he said. Keep the arm and rod straight and move them as if they are one unit from nine to one oclock, then let the energy in the rod cast the line. Use the line in the free hand to control its flight.I have to confess  though I did not admit it at the time  that this was not, strictly speaking, my first lesson in the difficult art of casting. No. I had been taken by a friend to a park in central London where, to the puzzlement of dog walkers, I spent an hour desperately trying to keep my arm straight, not flick my wrist, all of the above, and failed to catch even a leaf.Back on the water, I tried again. Hopeless. The ibis patrolling the river honked in derision.We moved downstream because our noise had disturbed the fish. I still was not catching a thing, not a nibble, and my shoulder was beginning to ache from my clumsy casting. I took consolation from the pleasure of being on the river, disturbed only by the strident call of the chucao, a bird considered holy by the Huilliche tribe that once lived in the region.But then there was a tug on the line. A distinct pull. A trout. Id caught a trout. Pure elation. I reeled it in clumsily, surprised at the strength of something that was only about 14 inches long and weighed less than three pounds. Mr. Redlich, almost as pleased as I was, made me pose for a photograph to capture the moment of glory.We then returned the fish to the water  anything less than nine pounds has to be put back.I was ready to quit when there was another tug, much more urgent than the first. The rod bent alarmingly. Even I knew it was the big one, seven pounds at least. I reeled in frantically.But there it went  the one that got away.As we celebrated my debut catch with a beer, I realized that fly-fishing does not have to be in a foaming river to be a challenge. There is the test that comes with choosing the stretch of water where the fish dally, the right rod, the most suitable fly, the correct weight of line. Thats the science.Then there is the beautiful art of casting. I asked Mr. Redlich to define how he does it  that effortless, unerring movement  but it would have been like asking Pablo Neruda to parse one of his poems or Lionel Messi to analyze how he beat five people on his way to scoring a goal.Another 35 years should crack it."}
{"text": "A Chinese-owned container ship, Cosco Shipping Panama, on Sunday became the first commercial vessel to successfully cross the Panama Canals newly expanded locks, a historic achievement that Panama hopes will keep the canal as relevant in this century as it was in the last.Panama built the expanded locks, without help from other governments, because the newer ships that increasingly carry the worlds cargo are too large to fit in the old canal.Seventy heads of state were invited to watch Cosco Shippings inaugural passage through the canals six massive locks  three on the Atlantic side, where the ship entered shortly after dawn, and three on the Pacific side, where the dignitaries patiently waited.Much of the ships transit was televised live to the nation and the world. Once the container ship successfully entered the first lock in mostly sunny, calm conditions, its passage was halted for speeches, sermons and exchanges of memorabilia. Panamanians who went to watch the maiden passage cheered, and bands played.As the ship made its way through the Atlantic locks, a serious accident  not related to the operation of the expanded canal  occurred near the Pacific side of the isthmus in the common waterway shared by ships passing through the old canal. The accident, involving a tugboat and an unidentified small ship, did not occur inside the old canals locks.The canal authority said in a statement that 21 people had received medical attention, including four who were injured seriously enough to be taken by ambulances to a private hospital. The four were in stable condition, and the cause of the accident was under investigation, according to the statement.Accidents of this severity are uncommon at the canal, which has operated with rarely a false note for more than a hundred years.The expanded canal opened amid questions about its long-term viability due to water availability and changes in shipping patterns. It opened nearly two years late, missing the 100th anniversary of the opening of the original canal, which was built by the United States. President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty in 1977 turning the canal over to the Panamanians, although the actual transfer did not occur until 1999.The ultimate cost of the project is not yet known because contractors have filed claims against the canal authority for an additional $3.4 billion  more than the cost of the original lock expansion project. A consortium of companies from Spain, Italy, Belgium and Panama won the contract with a $3.1 billion bid  a billion less than the second-lowest bid."}

{"text": "Much of the evidence supporting the emerging consensus that strong human rights safeguards promote and enhance development has come out of research from the World Bank. Yet the institution has been far too reluctant to make adherence to human rights a core principle by which it evaluates projects intended to reduce poverty and improve the lives of the worlds most vulnerable people.The bank is now in the final stages of updating its policies on how to reduce the environmental and social risks of projects and loans. This offers an opportunity to chart a new course.The World Bank was created in 1944 to play a leading role in rebuilding Europe after World War II. As its mission shifted to the developing world, the bank held on to a foundational principle: It stays out of the politics of the countries it works with and makes decisions based solely on economic considerations. That may have made sense in the geopolitical landscape of the post-World War II era and the Cold War. But it is anachronistic today.While the World Bank cannot reasonably be expected to become an enforcer of human rights law, there is much it can do to protect human rights and persuade borrowers to live up to commitments they have made in international treaties. Adopting a clear and substantive human rights policy would mirror the banks efforts to more carefully consider the environmental impact of the projects it funds.Bank officials, shareholders and borrowing countries have wrestled with this issue since 2012, when the latest review of the banks so-called safeguard policies began. The first draft of the new policy, which was released in 2014, was widely criticized by human rights advocates for presenting support for human rights as a vague, aspirational goal. Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said in a report last year that the bank was a human rights-free zone with operational policies that treat human rights more like an infectious disease than universal values and obligations.He and other critics say the bank has failed to adopt effective protocols to examine the potential social harm of projects it bankrolls. They also contend that the bank too often passes the burden of assessing and mitigating the impact of development work to the governments that get the funding.Labor and human rights activists have chided the World Bank for its slow and inadequate response to allegations that its funding was abetting forced labor in cotton fields in Uzbekistan. The Bank Information Center, a group that monitors World Bank projects,  faulted it for the involuntary displacement of thousands of families that resulted from an initiative to help poor people establish a legal claim to property in Cambodia.The bank has failed to play a more assertive role in human rights in part because bank executives have been reluctant to add more regulations to the work of an institution that is already infamously bureaucratic. They are also mindful of the rise of other international financial institutions  most significantly from China  that pay less attention to environmental and labor standards in financing.Still, the World Banks own research shows that embracing the protection of human rights as a core part of its mission is more than a moral imperative; it makes good economic sense. Bank studies have concluded that reducing gender inequity is good for prosperity and that communities where human rights are violated with impunity are more prone to armed conflict.Members of the banks Committee on Development Effectiveness received the latest draft of the banks proposed safeguards on Friday. As they review it, they should aim to make human rights integral to the banks development work."}
{"text": "Political leaders on both sides of the debate in Britain over whether to leave the European Union are now saying distinctly different things about some central issues than what they said before the referendum. Here are some examples.BEFORE Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the Remain campaign, said that if the country voted to leave, he would begin the formal process of leaving the union immediately by sending what is called an Article 50 notification to Brussels. He also said he would try to remain as prime minister.AFTER The morning after the referendum, Mr. Cameron said he would resign once a successor could be chosen and would leave it to his successor to issue the notification.BEFORE The Leave campaign promised that Britain would be  able to save 350 million pounds a week, or about $462 million as of Monday, that could be spent on the National Health Service, schools and housing. A slogan on the Leave campaign bus went further, promising explicitly to use that money to fund our N.H.S. instead. (The savings figure was widely disputed by economists, Remain campaigners and the Office for National Statistics.)AFTER Leave leaders, including Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party, and Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith of the Conservative Party, maintained that they had never promised that 350 million a week would be given to the N.H.S. Mr. Duncan Smith called the figure an extrapolation. Mr. Farage said that the 350 million claim was one of the mistakes that, I think, the Leave campaign has made and that anyone who voted to leave because of the promise made a mistake doing that.BEFORE George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, warned that a vote to leave would touch off an economic crisis that would require the government to adopt an emergency budget with spending cuts and tax increases.AFTER In an effort to calm the financial markets, which plunged after the referendum, Mr. Osborne said on Monday that Britain had the resources to weather the immediate crisis and that an emergency budget could wait until Mr. Camerons successor had taken office and assembled a new cabinet.BEFORE Leave campaigners promised to swiftly reduce the number of immigrants coming to Britain from other parts of Europe, which Mr. Johnson said could not happen while Britain remained in the union. Michael Gove, the justice secretary and an ally of Mr. Johnsons, said a vote to leave would bring down the numbers by 2020.AFTER Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E.U., they are going to be disappointed, said Daniel Hannan, a prominent Leave advocate and member of the European Parliament. To keep vital access to the European single market after leaving the union, Mr. Hannan acknowledged to the BBC, Britain would have to accept free movement of workers, as Norway and other nonmember states have."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  In the days since Britons voted to leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit referendum has created such severe turmoil that public attention is increasingly focused on an extreme option: Can they get out of it?Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday that he considered the referendum binding and that the process of implementing the decision in the best possible way must now begin. But he also said he would leave that process to his successor, after his expected resignation in October. This opens a window of at least four months during which time Britain could decide not to proceed, and avoid consequences from Europe.If the next prime minister does trigger the departure process, Britain then has two years to negotiate the terms of its leaving. While European Union rules say that membership is revoked automatically at the end of that period, Britain could theoretically use that time to negotiate an alternative plan.The country has a few options for how, during these two windows, it might remain in the European Union. Each carries significant risks and downsides, both for Europe and for Britain itself  but, then again, so does leaving.The referendum is not legally binding. The process of leaving does not begin until the prime minister officially invokes Article 50 of the European Unions governing treaty. So he or she could, in theory, carry on as if the vote had never happened.Mr. Cameron has already caused a delay by refusing to invoke Article 50 himself. Of his two most likely possible successors in the Conservative Party, Theresa May opposes leaving the union and Boris Johnson, a prime Brexit proponent, is already backpedaling, pledging on Monday that changes will not come in any great rush.Most members of Parliament opposed leaving the union, and might support a prime minister who refused to invoke Article 50. But that would be akin to overruling the will of 17.4 million Britons who voted to leave, an extreme step in a country that prides itself on democratic values.It would also risk inflaming the underlying political forces that led to the Leave victory: rising populist anger, distrust of seemingly unaccountable government institutions and a belief that the system is rigged.It is difficult to predict how pro-Brexit voters would respond if their government ignored the referendums result, but such a move risks empowering more extreme voices. British politics, already in tremendous turmoil, would face an uncertain future, as would the lawmakers who will be up for re-election.The House of Lords said in an April report that any decision to exit the European Union would have to be approved by the Parliaments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.Welsh voters supported Brexit, and Northern Irelands Parliament is led by a party that favors leaving the union. But Scottish voters overwhelmingly opposed leaving, and so does the governing Scottish National Party, which has pledged to take any available measures to remain in the bloc.Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, has suggested that her Parliament could withhold consent, sparking a constitutional crisis.That, in turn, could be an opportunity for leaders wishing to avoid a Brexit. The next prime minister could tell voters that he or she would like to carry out their will, but that leaving Europe is impossible without Scottish approval.This offers at least a hint more political legitimacy than simply disregarding the referendum.But if Britains next prime minister is intent on following through with Brexit, the British Parliament could repeal the law that gives Scotland veto power. Ms. Sturgeon would probably respond by seeking a new referendum on Scottish independence  something she has already threatened to do if Britain leaves the union.In 1992, Danish voters narrowly rejected a referendum on joining one of the treaties that laid the European Unions foundations. Eleven months later, after a flurry of diplomacy, Denmark held a second referendum, which voters approved.Similar scenarios unfolded in 2001  and again in 2008  when Irish voters rejected European Union treaties before embracing them in second referendums in subsequent years.Could British voters reverse themselves as well? By Monday, four days after the Brexit vote, an online petition calling for a do-over had 3.8 million signatures.But there is little reason to believe that a second referendum, were it held today, would yield a different result. While a handful of Britons have said on social media that they regretted their vote to leave the union, polling suggests that they are a tiny minority. A survey by ComRes, taken on Saturday, found that only 1 percent of Leave voters were unhappy with the results. (Brexit won by four percentage points, 52 to 48.)British leaders could justify a second cut at the question by securing special concessions from the European Union, like allowing Britain to put a cap on immigration. This approach was how Danish and Irish leaders persuaded their voters to approve the referendums they had previously rejected.Mr. Johnson, who said on Monday that Britain was part of Europe and always will be, hinted before the vote that he might pursue this strategy. There is only one way to get the change we need, and that is to vote to go, he wrote in a March op-ed in The Telegraph. All E.U. history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says No.A second vote would allow politicians to claim that they had followed the will of the voters and stood up to the European Union, avoiding both populist outrage and the economic and diplomatic fallout of a British exit.European leaders, however, may not be eager to go along. If any member state can extract special concessions by threatening to leave, it undermines the unions ability to make Europe-wide policies. It also gives other states an incentive to play chicken with exit referendums, a dangerous game that could easily end in disaster.There is also a risk that British voters would reject the second referendum as well. If that happened, there would truly be no going back.Article 50 gives an exiting country two years to negotiate terms for its relationship with the union, on issues like trade and migration.What if Britain struck a series of deals that largely preserved the status quo, only without formal European Union membership?This, too, seems to be something Mr. Johnson is pondering. In an op-ed in The Telegraph on Sunday, he promised that Britain would maintain free trade and free movement deals with Europe.As Rafael Behr, a columnist for The Guardian, joked on Twitter: Otherwise known as membership of the European Union. One model is Norway, which is not a European Union member but subscribes to its common market and open borders.Leave campaigners emphasized two goals: reducing migration and extracting Britain from European bureaucracy. While a Norway-style arrangement could, in theory, limit migration, it would worsen British subjugation to European policy makers.If Britain chose this path, it would have no vote and no presence when crucial decisions that affect the daily lives of its citizens are made, Norways former foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, warned last year.Such a deal would also probably require Britain to continue paying membership fees, which Leave campaigners promised to win back.Nicolas Vron, a French economist, wrote on the website of Bruegel, a research group in Brussels, that European leaders would probably oppose this arrangement, too, for fear of setting a bad precedent.These leaders, he said, want to send a clear and unambiguous message to other member states: If you leave the union, you will not be rewarded with a sweetheart deal allowing you the benefits of membership without the burden. You will get a hard and painful breakup, so think carefully."}

Through the years, Mr. Karnazes has run 350 miles straight (with no sleep), completed a 200-mile relay race (by himself), run across Death Valley in the middle of the summer, and run a marathon at the South Pole.Recently I caught up with Mr. Karnazes by phone at his home in Marin County, Calif., as he was getting ready to leave for his trip. He told me what interested him in the Silk Road (it was a stranger he met at the San Francisco Marathon), what traditional Greek food hes taking along on his journey, and why, despite his extraordinary achievements, hes just a bit worried about this challenge. Here are edited excerpts of our conversation.Ten years ago, you ran 50 marathons in 50 states in 50 days. What made you decide to go beyond traditional races  and ultras  and do something like this?The spirit of exploration. I had done hundreds of organized races and loved racing, but I also loved the thrill of conceiving an adventure on my own and seeing whether the impossible was possible.I wasnt sure I would be able to run 50 marathons back to back.

If we can just get out of the way of our perceived limitations, were really capable of extraordinary things.Did completing those 50 marathons change how you approached future long-distance ventures?There were mornings where I couldnt even roll out of bed. I thought, I cant even step out of bed today, and this is the ninth marathon, and I have to do this 41 more days in a row  how is this possible? I just committed to doing the best that I could every day.At the end of 50 days, it was telling that the 50th marathon, which was the New York City Marathon, was the strongest and my fastest of all 50.Why do you think your last marathon was your fastest?I was just so glad to be done with it. With that final marathon, I was able to let it all out and not worry about having to get up the next morning and have to run another marathon. I ran the New York City Marathon in three hours 30 seconds. Thats a pretty respectable marathon time.Whats been your favorite epic trek so far?Ive run on all seven continents of earth twice now. Ive run in some of the most remote and exotic places. But my pinnacle achievement was running a 10K with my daughter on her 10th birthday. I didnt think she was going to make it at five miles, and she said, Dad, I can do this. She let out a grunt and started sprinting. To me to see that, I saw her finally as her own person, and I saw resolve in her that Id never seen before.How old is your daughter now? Does she run?Shes 20. Shes a recreational runner.What brought you to the Silk Road?I was running the 2015 San Francisco Marathon and a guy came up next to me. This happens quite a bit  people recognize me on the course and they come up next to me and we chat. He started explaining to me that he worked for the State Department and was based in Kyrgyzstan. That led to me asking, Is there running there? Recreational running?He went on to disclose that hed been seeking me out and said, Ive got this idea that I want to pitch to you. I want you to follow in the footsteps of Alexander the Great.Im thinking this is just a fantasy, this guy. But his State Department contacts, they put a proposal in front of me. Im very bad at saying no, and this sounded too good to be true. So I said yes.How do you prepare for a trip like this?If you saw this agenda  when I first looked at it, I thought, Theyre going to kill me.Ive been watching the weather. Uzbekistan is right above Afghanistan. Its desert. Its 112 degrees. So Ive been running in the mid-day heat, which a lot of runners dont do. Also something runners dont do: Ive been purposefully dehydrating myself and running without water to get used to the fact that Im not going to have consistent support out in some of these more remote areas.Another thing Ive been doing is running a lot of mountains, because Im climbing a path thats nearly 12,000 feet high. Thats a pretty significant pop. Heartbreak Hill at the Boston Marathon is 236 feet.Im sure there are going to be a lot of unforeseen situations. Cell reception there is apparently really spotty. I dont know whats going to happen if I get lost out there.Tell me about your fueling strategy.Im going to take some products that were used to seeing. Ill take some Hammer Nutrition products and some electrolyte powder to mix with water. But Im going to try to rely mostly on the local foods. For example, in Greece I found this stuff called pasteli. Its honey and sesame seed. I thought, Wow, this is better than any gel pack Ive ever had, and its more sustaining.Where will you sleep?Im homesteading with families along the way, including staying in a yurt.Youre planning to run some 50 miles a day  and also holding clinics and talks, and inviting people to join in along the way. How come?The three countries Im visiting are celebrating 25 years of independence from the Soviet Union. The idea is to link these three countries together on this footpath. The power of running  it unites people.Theres a magic in running. Its so simple, its a commonality we all share as a species. Were divided by the color of our skin, divided by the God we believe in, socioeconomic level, whatever else, but runnings a great democratizer. The idea is to get people to come out and run along with me, to show together the power of running. Thats the whole idea behind this sports diplomacy program.What do you hope to achieve?Its a great adventure. Ive always wanted to see and visit the Silk Road. Im going to be pushing my body to the limits, and my mind as well. I really like that intensity of staying focused, and the discipline of running great distances and showing up and giving a talk and being coherent and cohesive when youre about ready to fall over.Whats next?Im planning on a global expedition to try to run a marathon in every country of the world in a one-year time span. So in 2017 Im taking off on a global trek.What advice do you have for nonprofessional runners who might be trying a similar challenge, like running across America?You dont have to go fast. You just have to go. Its just relentless forward progress. Ive run across the country a couple times now, one self-supported, one with a crew. Prepare for tremendous highs, and also tremendous, tremendous lows, where you just feel like, I might not be able to make it. I might not be able to get out of bed this morning.Every day, press onward, even if that means walking. The other thing on the flip side is not to lose sight of the adventure itself, to not to be so goal-oriented that all you want to do is just make it.

{"text": "The construction site outside the train station in one of Tokyos central night life and shopping districts had the typical workers in hard hats and fluorescent vests. And, not so typical, two pink-and-white Hello Kitty figures hanging off the barriers that keep pedestrians from stumbling into a hole in the road.Such figures, along with more than 30 varieties including elephants, giraffes, deer and dolphins, crop up on road barriers all over Japan, an effort to entertain passers-by who might otherwise regard construction sites as nuisances. They are part of a culture of kawaii, the Japanese word for cute, an adjective not generally associated with construction sites elsewhere.Sendai Meiban, which makes road signs, traffic cones and other construction-related materials, said it introduced its first kawaii traffic barricade, a monkey, 10 years ago on Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japans main islands.Tetsuya Hatakeyama, an official at the Tokyo National Highway Office that authorizes road work in the city, said the Hello Kitty figures spotted at the train station in the shopping district, Shinjuku, were introduced in December and have become something of a tourist attraction. Foreigners stop for selfies with the figures, he said, and children spot and enjoy them.And it goes beyond commercial cartoon characters.Fusao Hasegawa, 27, a contemporary artist in Tokyo, is trying to transform the humble traffic cone into an art form. He has designed cones imprinted with a mold of the face of Jizo Bosatsu, a Buddhist deity known as the guardian of the road. Several were placed around temples in Kita-Kamakura, about 30 miles southwest of Tokyo.Mr. Hasegawa said he was also drawing on the tradition of Do-So-Jin, a category of Shinto gods believed to watch over travelers and often memorialized in stone figures set by the side of roads.Once people see my art, he said, if they see an ordinary traffic cone, it will remind them of this work."}
{"text": "After traveling for five years and nearly 1.8 billion miles, NASAs Juno spacecraft will announce its arrival at Jupiter with the simplest of radio signals: a three-second beep.NASA expects the beep, marking the end of a 35-minute engine burn to slow the spacecraft down and allow it to be captured by Jupiters gravity, to arrive at Earth at 11:53 p.m. Eastern time next Monday.I can tell you when that completes, youre going to see a lot of celebration, said Rick Nybakken, Junos project manager, because that means well be in orbit around Jupiter, and thatll be really cool.Junos mission is to explore the enigmas beneath the cloud tops of Jupiter. How far down does the Big Red Spot storm that has swirled for centuries extend? What is inside the solar systems largest planet?We still have questions, and Juno is poised to begin answering them, Diane Brown, Junos program executive, said during a news conference this month.Juno will be the first craft to orbit Jupiter in more than a decade. NASAs earlier robotic explorer, Galileo, spent eight years there and sent back astounding images of the planet and its many moons. It revealed features like a large ocean under the icy crust of the moon Europa, now considered one of the most promising places to look for life elsewhere in the solar system.This time, the focus will be on Jupiter itself, and in particular what cannot be seen beneath its colorful cloud stripes.One of the primary goals of Juno is to learn the recipe for solar systems, said Scott Bolton, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio who is the principal investigator for the $1.1 billion mission. How do you make the solar system? How do you make the planets in our solar system?Jupiter is the titan among planets called the gas giants, with more than three times the mass of Saturn, the next largest. But it is far more than a bland ball of hydrogen and helium.What particularly piques scientists interest are the small amounts of heavier elements like lithium, carbon and nitrogen.Jupiter is enriched with these elements compared to the sun, Dr. Bolton said. We dont know exactly how that happened. But we know its really important. And the reason its important is the stuff that Jupiter has more of is what were all made out of. Its what the Earth is made out of. It is what life comes from.On July 4, as the main engine on the spacecraft fires, in the control room at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., there will be nothing to control, and all anyone there will be able to do is wait and watch.If anything goes wrong, there is no way for anyone to intercede. The radio signals take 48 minutes to travel from Jupiter to Earth. By the time engineers receive word the engine firing has begun, the engine should have already switched off, with the spacecraft in orbit.If the engine shuts off prematurely, Juno might still end up in orbit, albeit in the wrong orbit. If the engine fails, we dont end up in a very exciting spot, Mr. Nybakken said.We havent studied that too much in terms of where we end up, because were focused on success and not failure.In other words, Juno would zip right past Jupiter and end up in a useless orbit around the sun.Through the evening of July 4, mission control will receive only a series of radio tones  three-second bursts at different frequencies  telling the sequence of operations the spacecraft is performing. To point the engine in the correct direction, the main antenna will not be pointed at Earth, preventing more detailed telemetry. The spacecraft will also not send back any photographs or data from the instruments, which will be shut down on Wednesday, five days before its arrival, and will not be turned back on until a couple of days after its arrival. (NASA is holding back a series of photographs taken during the approach that it plans to release as a movie on July 4.)Juno is to make a series of 37 highly elliptical orbits passing over Jupiters north and south poles over 20 months.At its farthest, it will be about two million miles from Jupiter. For each orbit, it will accelerate inward, reaching 128,000 miles per hour, and pass within 3,100 miles of Jupiters cloud tops. The slight fluctuations in Jupiters gravitational pull, measured by shifts in the frequency of Junos radio signals, will tell the density of the planets interior and whether there is a rocky core within, where pressures might reach half a billion pounds per square inch.We dont really know if there is a core in the middle of Jupiter, Dr. Bolton said. If there is, it tells you sort of when and how and a little bit of where Jupiter must have formed.Junos science instruments include one to measure Jupiters powerful magnetic fields and an infrared camera to observe the glowing auroras around the poles. At depth, increasing pressures transform hydrogen from a gas into a liquid. At even greater depths, the hydrogen issqueezed so tightly that the electrons squirt out, changing it into a metal. It is probably the churning of liquid metallic hydrogen that generates the magnetic fields.Juno also carries a camera for taking the usual kind of photographs, not as part of its prime science mission but as a way to attract public participation. Anyone can sign in to the Southwest Research Institutes Mission Juno website and suggest where the camera should be pointed and then vote on the choices.Its really a public camera, Dr. Bolton said. They can engage in the debate of which things are most important to photograph.Also on board Juno are three Lego custom minifigures made of spacecraft-grade aluminum. One is Jupiter, the king of the Roman gods. The second is Juno, wife and sister of Jupiter in Roman mythology, and the third is Galileo Galilei, the Italian astronomer who discovered the four large moons of Jupiter through a telescope he made.We put these Lego minifigures on Juno in order to inspire and motivate and engage children, to help them share the excitement of space exploration, Dr. Bolton said.After the first two orbits, during which engineers will check if the spacecraft and instruments are working properly, Juno is to fire its engine again to move into the orbit for making its scientific measurements.Although the craft are very different in appearance, much of Junos electronics and programming are based on the design of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, an earlier spacecraft also built by Lockheed Martin. Its just configured in a different format, Guy Beutelschies, the director of interplanetary missions at Lockheed Martin, said in an interview.Instead of developing electronic circuits that could operate in Jupiters intense radiation, Lockheed Martin used the same circuitry as Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter but shielded it within the half-inch-thick walls of a 400-pound titanium vault measuring about one yard on each side.Unlike earlier missions to the outer solar system, Juno is powered by sunlight, not plutonium. Three solar panels 30 feet long with a total of 18,698 solar cells gather the dim sunlight to produce about 500 watts.Even if everything goes better than planned, the mission will not last much beyond the planned 20 months. Despite the titanium armoring, we know the radiation is going to kill us, Mr. Beutelschies said.Juno is expected to receive a radiation dose equivalent to more than 100 million dental X-rays.One planet farther out, at Saturn, NASAs Cassini spacecraft is being readied for what its managers have called the grand finale. Almost 12 years after it arrived, Cassini is, through some slingshots past the moon Titan, swinging its orbit out of the plane of the moons and rings.Beginning next April, Cassini will begin a series of 22 close flybys of Saturn, threading a narrow gap between the planet and its innermost ring, measuring Saturns gravitational and magnetic fields. Saturn is thought to have a rocky core perhaps as massive as Earth or perhaps several Earths. Cassini will also take stunning close-up images of the rings. Its like having a brand new mission, said Linda Spilker, Cassinis project scientist.Then, on Sept. 15 next year, with its maneuvering fuel almost used up, it will shift its trajectory and end its 20-year mission with a death dive straight into Saturn, sending back data about the atmosphere until it is torn apart.Five months later, Juno is scheduled to be similarly disposed at Jupiter. Then, for the first time in more than two decades, no NASA spacecraft will be orbiting any of the outer planets. The next mission to Jupiter, still on the drawing board, is to take a closer look at Europa. If it is built, it may not get there for a decade."}
{"text": "R. Michael Brown, a designer who helped preserve the lavish interiors of some of New York Citys most famous buildings, including Radio City Music Hall and Grand Central Terminal, by ambitiously applying an expansion of the citys landmarks preservation law, died on June 16 in Kingston, N.Y. He was 78.The cause was lymphoma, Stephen Frost, his partner and only immediate survivor, said.The razing in 1967 of the old Metropolitan Opera House at Broadway and 39th Street, whose golden core was masked by a hideous industrial yellow-brick facade, prompted the city to expand the jurisdiction of the fledgling Landmarks Preservation Commission to include building interiors.Mr. Brown, first appointed to the commission by Mayor Abraham D. Beame in 1977, wielded power for nearly five years. He began his crusade by saving the majestic spaces in Radio City Music Hall, and set a precedent that ultimately led to the designation of 117 interiors as landmarks.Under his watch, the commission also voted to preserve the interiors of Grand Central Terminal, the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia Airport and the original City Hall subway station.There was a section of the law which anticipated that there would be interior landmarks, Kent Barwick, who was chairman of the commission during most of Mr. Browns tenure, said in an interview last week, but all that was theoretical until R. Michael Brown came along.Since Mr. Brown left the commission, it has preserved the interiors of a number of vintage Broadway theaters (against the objections of their owners, who feared their property values would decline), the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center, the Tweed Courthouse, the lobbies of two Williamsburgh Savings Bank buildings in Brooklyn, the Four Seasons Restaurant, the TWA Flight Center at Kennedy Airport, the Daily News Building lobby, the New York Public Library and the Ford Foundation atrium.Michael started a movement that resulted in the protection of Broadway theaters and other commercial interiors that were hugely controversial because of politics and owner opposition, said Kate Wood, the president of Landmark West, a preservation group, and the author, with Judith Gura, of Interior Landmarks: Treasures of New York.In 1980, Mr. Brown generated popular support for that movement by recruiting volunteers to conduct a joint survey for the commission and the American Society of Interior Designers, which identified nearly 1,000 sites, including office building lobbies, religious institutions and private homes, that were deemed deserving of preservation even though some did not meet the criteria of the landmarks commission.To qualify for official landmark status, a site must be at least 30 years old and have special historical or aesthetic interest or value as part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the city, state or nation, according to the commission.It also must be a place that is customarily open or accessible to the public, or to which the public is customarily invited, which generally means that religious institutions and private residences are exempt.Robert Michael Brown was born in Indianapolis on Nov. 20, 1937. His father, also named Robert, owned a trucking company. His mother, the former Sarah Louise Colglazier, was a secretary for the A.&P. grocery chain.His first job was in his hometown, with the display department of L. S. Ayres, a department store, which later transferred him to New York to run the stores buying office. He attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and became an interior designer; he would be the first appointed to the landmarks commission.In 1978, with demolition threatening the financially ailing Radio City Music Hall  described by Herbert Muschamp, The New York Timess architecture critic, as our Rainbow Arch, our Old Faithful, our Niagara Falls  the commission declared its interior a landmark, and Mr. Brown organized a traveling photography exhibition to celebrate its significance.Mr. Brown, who lived in New York City and Red Hook in the Hudson Valley, subsequently organized the Significant Interiors Survey, which documented places he believed were worth preserving and which formed the basis for his guide, Preserving a Fragile Art: A Manual for Surveying Significant Interiors.I think the thing that really made me so passionate about this survey was the loss of All Angels Church at 80th Street and West End Avenue two years ago, Mr. Brown told The Times in 1982.The churchs unremarkable neo-Gothic exterior cloaked an interior designed by the Louis Comfort Tiffany studio. The outside of that building gave no hint whatsoever about what was inside, Mr. Brown said.The story of our lives is written in interiors, how we lived, how we worked, how we played, how we worshiped, he added. Interiors are much more fragile than exteriors. Just look around and see how many weve lost to Sheetrock modernization and demolition.Mr. Brown also figured in a decision involving a prominent exterior: the steel framework of the Queensboro Bridge. Because the bridge is an official landmark, its color falls under the commissions jurisdiction.City officials had planned to draw on a surplus supply of light blue paint until Mr. Brown intervened and chose, appropriately enough, a two-tone combination described as Queensboro brown and mesa tan."}
{"text": "Arthur Brooks: What a week, Gail. The Brits decide to leave the European Union. Anyone who doubts that major nations can take a big populist turn just got a wake-up call, to put it mildly. Everyone wonders whos next. The Dutch? The French? Ive been seeing a lot on Twitter about Texit, which Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, apparently felt the need to explain wont be happening.Gail Collins: Arthur, they are already at it. At this very minute, theyre sewing Texit flags in Lubbock.You know, I once wrote a book about Texas in which I pooh-poohed the whole secession thing. At the time, a poll had 18 percent of the citizenry favoring the idea. I pointed out disparagingly that that was about the same as the proportion of Republicans who said it might be a good idea to nominate Donald Trump for president.Ha. Ha.Arthur: Is that a nervous laugh or a mirthless chuckle? I cant tell.Donald Trump was thrilled with the Brexit decision, which he feels was an insurgent movement similar to the one that supports him in America. People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense, he said at a press conference in Scotland (which actually overwhelmingly voted Remain). So I think youre going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that, and I think that its happening in the United States. Its happening by the fact that Ive done so well in the polls.What do you make of it? Is Brexit an expression of British Trumpism?Gail: Im still trying to get past Trumps victorious press conference at his floundering Scottish golf course. During which he stated that running a golf course is very much like running a nation.The British get-out leaders are now spending all their time retracting the promises they made about the wonderful benefits of exiting. And Im imagining a victorious Trump explaining how the Mexican wall was just a figure of speech.But how do you think this is all going to work out  terrible international economic disaster or life goes on as usual except for the poor suckers in Britain who thought their E.U. subsidies were going to magically continue without the E.U.?Arthur: The immediate effects of Brexit were clear: Markets tanked worldwide and the pound temporarily fell to a 30-year low. Markets despise uncertainty.The long-term effects are much less clear. Tony Blair had a piece in The Times on Saturday predicting fairly apocalyptic results for Britain. My American Enterprise Institute colleagues are on both sides. Some were more supportive of the Leavers, and argue that new agreements could ensure that trade and people still flow freely without the drawbacks of E.U. membership. Others agree with Blair and fear this could trigger a global economic crisis.Gail: You and your colleagues are certainly a beacon of cheer.Arthur: They dont let many optimists join the Dismal Science Union.Judging by the early commentary, many are eager to blame the Leave result on reactionary, anti-immigrant bigotry. But I think its important for Americans to remember that there were also a lot of good people with no anti-immigrant sentiment whatsoever who favored Leave  like Michael Gove, an M.P. who is a rising star in the Conservative Party. It wasnt foreigners they resented, but the stultifying socialist mediocrity of Brussels and the dreaded inevitability of bailing out Greece and others. The referendum seemed to reflect widespread dissatisfaction with European governance, not some simple xenophobia.Gail: Our colleague Paul Krugman has always warned us about the euro. People should be able to devalue their currencies if they get in trouble.Arthur: You know, people always tell me, You sound just like Paul Krugman! Actually, I think thats the first time ever.But Krugman has a point about the problems of the euro, which took monetary policy away from countries so they couldnt devalue their currencies after living ruinously beyond their means. Britain managed to keep the British pound, of course, but still feels the increasing burden of arcane E.U. rules and regulations.Gail: As an observer from afar, I have noticed a tendency for E.U. and arcane rules and regulations to appear in the same sentence.Arthur: But back to your question. I think there will be economic and political consequences from leaving, but the doomsday predictors overplayed their hand a little. The union is less than 25 years old, before which Britain and its economy were doing just fine. To argue that leaving the E.U. would lead to plagues and locusts just didnt ring true to a lot of voters.As to the political effects here in the States, I sort of doubt this will help or hurt Trump. As a rule, foreign events capture the American imagination for about nine seconds. It gave Trump a great opportunity to promote that golf course, though.Gail: Which, he tastefully assured the world, will benefit from Brexit. Who cares about auto workers when the caddies are doing well?Arthur: Just as long as theyre native-born caddies, I suppose.Before we leave this topic, tell me how you would have voted if you were British.Gail: Id have voted to remain. Im dubious of separatist movements in general. Although I must admit that when I covered the state capitol in New York, I had a fling with the idea of New York City secession.Arthur: I tend to be more of a separatist, especially after living for several years in Catalonia. Hey, how about we start a movement for New York City to secede and become part of the E.U.? Win-win.Gail: By the way, I noticed your favorite congressman, Paul Ryan, finished releasing his multipart Republican platform. I did have sympathy for the way every one of his unveilings was overshadowed by a Trump catastrophe until the end, when of course Britain conspired to make the last press conference  muted.All in all, I found the whole thing bland in the extreme. Sort of a vague wish list. What say you?Arthur: Its hard to make serious policy sound sexy when the media insists that the end of the world is upon us. Only at A.E.I. would someone say, Did you see Paul Ryans new tax plan? Its a real bodice-ripper!Ryan and the Republican committee chairs unveiled their health plan at A.E.I., actually. It focuses a lot on the fiscal sustainability of entitlements and trying to make coverage more portable  a good start on laying out what they could do if Republicans ever got control of the White House. More to the point, it belies the clich that conservatives have no ideas and only criticize Obama and his fellow Democrats.Gail: Its economic assumptions are way too optimistic to make sense. Id argue that Hillary Clinton does a much better job of showing how shes going to pay for the changes shes pushing. That of course is one of the reasons she was so much less exciting than Bernie Sanders.Also, its too general to be meaningful. Its hard to argue with mush. You need more specifics  stuff like eliminating the death tax. Now thats a specific statement which I would be happy to excoriate. My kind of Republican platform.Arthur: I like almost all sentences that start with eliminating and finish with tax. In any case, as the resident policy wonk, I have never met a proposal where I wouldnt have liked more specifics.Before we close on a note of agreement, one last question: Whats on the top of your summer reading list?Gail: Arthur, I love conversing with you but I hate questions about my summer reading. Ive got a book due. I dont know about you, but when Im writing books I never get to read books. Except for research. Right now if you looked on my nightstand youd see a biography of Millicent Fenwick. A wealthy Republican congresswoman of yore who fought for civil rights and never twittered. Those were the days.Arthur: I bet you just spiked sales of Millicent Fenwicks biography. I admit I had to look her up and found that she smoked a pipe. So there you are. See you next week, Gail."}
{"text": "Sam Bell, who turned out some of Americas best middle-distance runners as a college track and field and cross-country coach, died on Monday in Bloomington, Ind., the home of Indiana University, where he had spent most of his 40-year career. He was 88.Indianas athletics department announced his death.Bell was a head coach at Oregon State (1958-65), California (1965-69) and Indiana (1969-98). His 1961 cross-country team at Oregon State won the N.C.A.A. championship. At Indiana, his mens team won 22 Big Ten titles in indoor and outdoor track and cross-country; his womens team there won four titles.He had wide success coaching milers and half-milers. Berny Wagner, who succeeded him at Oregon State, told Track and Field News in 1991, Sams very intense, and middle-distance runners have to be intense.Bell coached an impressive roster of runners who went on to compete in the Olympics, among them Dyrol Burleson in high school; Morgan Groth and Tracy Smith at Oregon State; and Jim Spivey, Bob Kennedy, Terry Brahm, Mark Deady, Sunder Nix, Robert Cannon and DeDee Nathan at Indiana.Bells mantra to his athletes was to compete not just with a rival team but also with themselves  to strive to surpass what they had already accomplished.Coach Bell always put goals in front of me, even immediately after I had achieved one, Spivey, a three-time Olympic runner and later a coach at the University of Chicago and Vanderbilt, told Runners World magazine in 1990.Once, he added, I ran four minutes for the mile and was feeling pretty good about that. He came up to me and said: Thats great. Now lets get the Big Ten record and run 3:55.Some runners at Indiana were shaken after meets when Bell and his staff would put out The Weekly Reader, listing statistics of individual performances as well as commentary, which could often be critical. Deady told Track & Field News: Hed make some comments in those that would just scare me to death: Gotta get your head out of your butt if youre going to run a race, and things like that. But his barks worse than his bite. I guess Id call him a paternal coach.Kennedy, in the same article, recalled Bells retirement party at Indiana. As I waited for the retirement speeches to begin, he said, Coach pulled me aside and talked about my track season. He spoke to others about work and family. He listened intently and gave each of us some advice. And then I realized that nothing had changed, nothing was over. He may have retired from coaching, but Coach Bell is still teaching, and we are all still learning.George Sam Bell was born on March 7, 1928, in Columbus, Mo. He earned a bachelors degree in political science and English at Doane College in Nebraska in 1950 and a masters in physical education at Oregon in 1956.He was head coach of the United States team at a 1964 dual meet against the Soviet Union held in Los Angeles, one of a series of meets between the countries during the Cold War. He also coached the United States mens distance runners at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and the American team at the World Cup competition in 1979 and was meet director of the Pan American Games in 1987 and the United States Olympic trials in 1988.In the late 1970s, Bell was a leader in the drive to found the Athletics Congress (now U.S.A. Track & Field) to replace the Amateur Athletic Union as the American governing body for the sport.He was elected to the National Track Hall of Fame in 1992 and the United States Track Coaches Hall of Fame in 2002.Bell, who lived in Bloomington, is survived by his wife, Fran; three daughters, Laurie Boer, Julie Bell and Beth Ahearn; a son, Scott; and nine grandchildren."}
{"text": "Ted Cruz and John Kasich have a message for Donald J. Trump: They dont care if they are not invited to speak at his convention.As Mr. Trump tries to plan a convention that will run as smoothly as possible, he said in an interview with The New York Times last week that he would not invite either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich, both former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, to speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland unless they endorsed him.That is fine, both said on Monday. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, Catherine Frazier, said the Texas senator did not have any expectation about receiving a speaking slot. A spokesman for Mr. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, was similarly indifferent.We have not sought nor are we expecting a speaking slot at the convention, said the spokesman, Chris Schrimpf.In Mr. Kasichs case, the situation is even more strained because the convention will take place in his home state. Ordinarily, a governor whose party is hosting a convention in his backyard would play a big role. Not this year.Mr. Kasichs spokesman said the governor plans to be in and around Cleveland that week. But he has no plans to be involved in anything that has to do with Mr. Trump.Instead, he will attend events focusing on keeping the Republican majorities in Congress and winning races down ballot, Mr. Schrimpf said.If Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich never set foot in the convention hall, they would hardly be the only Republicans staying away. Other governors, senators, members of Congress and senior party officials are skipping, too. Even some delegates are renouncing their roles.Add to the prominent potential absences a difficulty in meeting fund-raising goals and snubs by several major corporate sponsors like Apple and Coca-Cola. Mr. Trump is running out of time to achieve his goal of a show that goes off without a hitch. It begins in three weeks."}

{"text": "THE EXTRABy A. B. YehoshuaTranslated by Stuart Schoffman249 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $24.Noga, a 42-year-old professional harpist and the headstrong, elliptical heroine of A. B. Yehoshuas new novel, The Extra, doesnt want children. Nine years earlier that refusal led to her divorce, and since then she has left Israel for a job with a Dutch orchestra and drifted into an amiable affair with a colleague. But after her father dies she returns to Jerusalem and faces the questions that loved ones and strangers just wont stop asking. Is her childlessness a quirk, a stigma or an affliction  or does it perhaps offer her an opportunity to reset the course of her life?Yehoshua is one of Israels pre-eminent novelists and, with his fellow writers Amos Oz and David Grossman, among the countrys most insistent voices pleading for engagement and peace with the Palestinians. Yehoshua often uses his fictional characters as test cases for political issues, and Noga is no exception. After all, fertility is a subject of political anxiety and religious injunctions in Israel. The first divine commandment voiced in Genesis instructs man to be fruitful and multiply; its the reason for both the prodigious numbers of children in ultra-Orthodox families and for Israels liberal fertility laws. The memory of a million Jewish children murdered during the Holocaust also weighs heavily on many couples planning a family. Add to that fears of a demographic imbalance fed by the high birthrate among Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, and its no wonder that women like Noga are on the defensive.The Extra is an engaging, slack and sometimes frustrating novel, translated in dignified but stilted prose by Stuart Schoffman, that reflects both Yehoshuas gift for surreal comedy and his penchant for schoolmasterly expositions. (Few writers are quite so fond of explaining their own metaphors.) The books title refers to the work Noga finds upon her return to Israel as an extra on film and television sets. Her music has been put on hold for three months, the duration of the experiment, as her brother, Honi, calls it, during which their mother agrees to try out assisted living in Tel Aviv while Noga house-sits her apartment in Jerusalem. Oddly for a professional musician  or perhaps emblematic of a certain self-sabotaging streak  Noga makes no arrangements to secure a harp on which to practice while she is in Israel, even though the orchestra has promised her a rare solo in Mozarts Concerto for Flute and Harp upon her return to the Netherlands. Instead, she drifts into occasional jobs in a succession of comically absurd and sharply drawn vignettes.On the set of a courtroom drama she plays a jury member bidden to read out the guilty verdict. For a hospital show, she enacts a patient in a wheelchair. In a documentary, she stands in for the camera-shy ex-girlfriend of a professor. In an open-air production of Bizets Carmen at Masada, the ancient fortress in the Judean Desert, she slips into the guise of a peasant woman pulling a donkey cart.Meanwhile she presides over her own Masada in the form of her mothers apartment in a Jerusalem neighborhood, formerly a bastion of secularism, that has recently turned black with ultra-Orthodox residents. The shadowy lawyer of the absentee landlord continues to stalk her: If the apartment should appear to be uninhabited, even briefly, hes ready to seize it and turn it over to a religious tenant. At the same time, two children from a neighboring ultra-Orthodox family persist in slipping into the living room to watch forbidden TV. Even Nogas ex-husband still has a key, and is not shy to use it.To readers familiar with the rhetorical currency of the Middle East conflict, the metaphor is transparent: Legitimacy demands continued presence. Without it, Jewish claims to the Holy Land, or a Palestinian familys claim to its ancestral home, are naught. To drive home the point, Noga must watch helplessly as her orchestra moves up the Mozart concerto and replaces her with another harpist. The ultra-Orthodox boys also test, and come up against the limits of, Nogas maternal instincts. Threats and curses, a new lock for the front door and a camel-driving whip purchased in East Jerusalem cant keep the boys away.In a scene that proves emblematic of Nogas prickly, contradictory but warmhearted character, one of the boys, a descendant of a revered religious leader, or tzaddik, clambers down a drainpipe hoping to sneak in through the bathroom window. Noga, who is soaking in the tub, notices that he is about to fall and pulls him inside. Without pausing to cover herself, she strips off the boys sour-smelling clothes and bundles him into what Yehoshua slyly describes as a sort of secular reversal of the mikvah, the Jewish ritual bath. Dousing him with fresh water, she diligently purifies his body, no organ escaping the hand of the confident musician, and while doing so she recalls the advice her father gave her mother, to handle the tzaddik with care, for he might become the leader of a stubborn religious camp that could topple a government. Sure, why not; let him topple a government, but at least he wont pollute it.Throughout, the conflict between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews is much more fleshed out in The Extra than that between Israelis and Palestinians. Its only as she leaves to return to her adopted home in the Netherlands that Noga reflects, almost as an aside, that her brother and mother remain in a country that never ceases to be a threat to itself.For the most part the novels characters are too self-absorbed and too caught up in a hazy world of as-ifs  the mothers experiment with a high-end retirement home, Nogas work as an extra in stories that havent yet been fully plotted  to register much interest in terrorism or war. Who am I to decide if the danger is real or exists only in newspaper articles? Noga asks indignantly when her ex-husband speculates that her refusal to have children stemmed from pessimism about Israels future. Her work as an extra only confirms to her how arbitrary and fluid the borders are between what is real and what is being imagined for us by others.Eventually, Noga will return to her passion for music. In compensation for the stolen Mozart concerto, she is given the opportunity to play the prominent first harp part in Debussys La Mer  Yehoshua is very intent on spelling out the French homonym of sea and mother, or mre  on what may prove to be a sweetly cathartic tour to Japan.But for most of the novel Noga is trapped in other peoples stories, rolling the prop that is her wheelchair down the byzantine corridors of a hospital set, wondering if there is a back exit from imagination into reality. Yehoshua is a master in his visual sketches of scenes like these, down to the quality of the evening sun pouring in the remains of its day, a potion of copper and gold. Its a shame that he also feels compelled to explain such a scene right away, as when it occurs to Noga suddenly that this entire huge and forbidding warehouse ... is a metaphor for humanity, and we are all extras in its story, not knowing if a credible and satisfying resolution awaits us at the end."}
{"text": "BRUSSELS  Less than 24 hours after Britain threw Europes postwar order into disarray last Thursday by voting to leave the European Union, dozens of officials from the blocs 28 member countries and its executive arm met behind closed doors in a drab Brussels office block to discuss the urgent issues at hand.The meeting ended without a decision, however, and was followed on Monday by more inconclusive and confidential wrangling in the Albert Borschette Congress Center in Brussels.The main issue under discussion was not Brexit, as Britains departure from the bloc is called, but another divisive cause embraced by British foes of the European Union: the freedom to use certain types of weed killer.While Berlin, Europes de facto capital, has hosted crisis meetings in recent days to discuss how to respond to Britains vote, Brussels, the putative capital of Europe, has stuck doggedly to its own stately rhythms. On Friday and Monday, it plowed ahead with arcane debates about weeds, fish, organic farming and other subjects that have come to form the substance of the so-called European project.This scrutiny of technical minutiae has turned the European Union into a regulatory superpower, allowing it to help set norms and standards used around the world. But that tight focus has crippled its ability to grapple with big issues or to engage with many ordinary people. As the British vote showed, many people feel no connection with what began as an idealistic peace project after World War II, but is now widely viewed as a meddling and undemocratic bureaucratic machine.One thing many in Brussels now agree on is that something has to change in the way the European Union works. But deciding what that is, exactly, will not happen swiftly, Frans Timmermans, the Dutch first vice president of the blocs executive body, the European Commission, cautioned Monday in a post on Facebook.The Brexit vote is not an isolated incident and is not just about Europe, Mr. Timmermans wrote. It is also about a broad sentiment in Western societies that we have lost control of our destinies.The search for some sort of answer will start on Tuesday at a previously scheduled two-day summit meeting of European leaders. It will be the first full gathering of the leaders, including the British prime minister, David Cameron, since last Thursdays referendum. The group will consider for the first time how to respond to the British vote.But the leaders will do so only after sticking to the original agenda focused on migration, investment and other matters. The all-important discussion will be squeezed into a dinner attended by Mr. Cameron and other leaders on Tuesday. The British leader will then be excluded from the second day of the summit meeting when leaders of the 27 remaining countries will begin assessing the future direction of the bloc without Britain.Founded on the premise that countries, including former enemies, can and must work in harmony, the European Union, with its elaborate machinery of consensus-driven decision making, instinctively recoils from any public airing of the blocs anxieties and deep divisions.The E.U. was not set up as a crisis-management organization, but now it obviously has to become one, said Paul Adamson, a longtime British lobbyist based in Brussels and founder of E!Sharp, an online magazine devoted to European affairs.Like nearly all Britons in Brussels, Mr. Adamson said he was stunned and angered by the victory for opponents of the European Union. We are all in shock and trying to come with terms with what happened, he said.He added that there is still a lot to play for, including the possibility that Britain might decide not to quit after all, or opt for a close association agreement that would be tantamount to staying.About the only Britons celebrating in Brussels are the 24 members of the European Parliament from the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, a driving force behind the Brexit campaign. I have been campaigning for years to lose my job, Stuart Agnew, a UKIP member of Parliament, said of his position in Brussels.Confronted with the biggest crisis to hit Europes six-decade push for greater integration, the European Commission has sought to present a face of implacable calm, despite anguish over Brexit among its officials.Asked on Monday at a news briefing what conclusions the commission might draw from the British vote, its chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said that this was a matter for Britain. The commission didnt call the referendum, he said. The ones who did are the ones who have to draw conclusions.Behind the scenes, most Britons working in the commission and other European institutions in Brussels are in a state of barely disguised despair.Catherine Bearder, a British member of the European Parliament for the Liberal Democrats, said she felt gutted on Monday.I think there is a feeling across the board of, What on earth is Britain doing?  she said.Mr. Cameron has said he will resign by October, suggesting that London might wait until then to formally start the withdrawal process, but officials in Brussels want the pace sped up. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, by contrast, has shown some sympathy for Britains play for time.Waiting until October to start negotiating on the terms of Britains exit and its future relationship with the bloc might give time for Britain to perhaps change its mind. But this would also slow any efforts to reshape a union that even the most stalwart fans of European integration acknowledge is far from perfect.Those who support the idea of turning Europe into a federal state are even hoping that the crisis set off by the British vote will invigorate their sagging cause, a prospect that is unlikely to fly.British opponents of the bloc campaigned on the idea that the constant meddling of unelected officials in Brussels was holding their country down and destroying its way of life. By banning weed killers, in one example.Now EU Fat Cats Want to Ban Our Weed Killer, read a headline in April in the Daily Express, a British tabloid that supported the Brexit campaign.In reality, officials in the European Commission have been pushing for months to extend an approval, first granted in 2002 and now set to expire on Friday, for the use in Europe of popular weed killers, like Roundup.But they had problems getting member states to agree in the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feeds. Delays by France, Germany and other governments meant that the issue, like many others in the European Union, continued to be kicked down the road.The idea that we wanted a ban was just one of the false myths spread by British tabloids, said Enricio Brivio, a spokesman for the European Commissions department that deals with health and food safety. What could we do? I do not know.Mr. Agnew, the UKIP member of the European Parliament, acknowledged that the officials had actually tried to do the right thing. He nonetheless derided their fruitless efforts as a symptom of the E.U.s shambolic decision making.As debates on weed killer and other matters continue in Brussels, the European Commission is trying to avoid a breakdown of its bureaucratic system in the event that the hundreds of British citizens working in the organization suddenly decide to leave. It has assured them that their jobs are safe despite their countrys vote to withdraw.The most senior Briton in the apparatus, the commissioner of financial services, Jonathan Hill, resigned over the weekend in response to the referendum result.Some lower officials are hanging tight for the moment, saying they did not come to Brussels just to work for Britain. It remains to be seen, many cautioned, whether Brussels gets the message that there needs to be fundamental reform of the European project."}
{"text": "Like so many others who beat the odds to make it to Broadway, they arrived with personal stories to tell.Muhammad Yunus, 18, who was born in Indonesia, was a rapper with no connection to musical theater until six months ago, when he played the lead in a student production of Lin-Manuel Mirandas In the Heights. Marnie Quick, 17, didnt think shed get to the big stage because she was still recovering from a concussion and a dislocated pubic bone at the time of auditions. Deimoni Brewington, 17, is taunted at his Las Vegas high school and even by some relatives for choosing musical theater over macho pursuits like football.Yeah, I cried a lot, he said of the teasing. But when I go into rehearsal, I put away all the mess and drama of my life and have fun. Musical theater gave me my identity.These three teenagers and 59 others from around the country performed onstage at the Minskoff Theater on Monday night at the National High School Musical Theater Awards, now in their eighth year. The evening was part prize ceremony, part bake-off, with eight finalists performing one song each.At the end, two graduating seniors walked off with the top honors: Amina Faye, from the Central Academy of Technology and Arts in Monroe, N.C., and Josh Strobl, from John Burroughs High School in Burbank, Calif. Accepting her award, Ms. Faye told the other performers, I love you all and I cant wait to see where the future takes us all.The ceremony capped a 10-day theatrical boot camp for the students, with early wake-up calls and all-day coaching from six Broadway performers. The teenagers stayed in New York University dorm rooms, did yoga, ate together in a common area and received both individual and group instruction from the coaches and Kiesha Lalama, a choreographer with the Pittsburgh CLO theater organization, which is a founder of the awards.The winners received $10,000 toward their college educations and a chance to audition for acceptance and a scholarship to the Tisch School of the Arts at N.Y.U. Finalists and other award winners got $2,500 scholarship grants.To make the cut, each student first won a competition as the best male or female high school performer in one of 31 regions. More than 1,000 schools and 50,000 students competed for honors. The prizes are known as the Jimmy Awards, in honor of the Broadway producer and theater owner James M. Nederlander, 94.For four students, the trip was their first time in an airplane. But for Ms. Quick, who began taking music classes at 10 weeks, the show was familiar; it was her third time performing at the awards and her second time as a finalist, singing Safer from First Date in this years competition.Its pretty crazy, she said of the past year, which was upended when she smashed her cheek and hip on a concrete floor while acting in a student film. A concussion left her muddy for months afterward, setting her behind in school and hurting her auditions for colleges.I was talking to my mom about how different I am since 2014, she said. Im more open, not afraid to try new things. Getting through the concussion and dislocation is a big deal. When I get home, Im going straight into physical therapy.The two winners arrived by different paths. Ms. Faye, who sang Your Daddys Son, from Ragtime, in a group medley and then A New Life, from Jekyll & Hyde, for her solo, has pursued musical theater seriously since ninth grade and plans to major in it at Penn State next year.She said to me a year and a half ago, I love musical theater, but Im going into law, her high schools music director, Marty Gregory, said. And I said to her: Yeah, right. Lets not get carried away here with reality. Dream the dream.Mr. Strobl, by contrast, was more interested in singing in alternative-rock bands until an audience member at a show encouraged him to give musical theater a shot. I hadnt gotten into acting until this year, he said.This years upbeat awards, in which the students were repeatedly hailed as Broadways future, came during a season in which seven of the 11 new musicals on Broadway have closed or are closing. The opening number included snippets from some of the successes, including Waitress and Hamilton. The awards M.C., Zachary Levi, noted that his own show, the Tony-nominated musical She Loves Me, was closing in two weeks, and encouraged the audience to buy tickets. Time is money, folks, he said.Besides solo performances, many of the students performed in costume in small-group medleys. (One Wednesday and two Gomezes from The Addams Family musical turned up, for example.) Watching a group of boys, Van Kaplan, a co-founder of the awards program and the shows director, said it was often hard to remember that the performers were high school students: I have to stop and say, some of them are just 16.Many parents also came to New York for the event, but they were kept away from their children until after the final ceremony. Until then, the students were in the care of chaperones.I text my mom, but I havent seen her, Sarah Chico, 17, a junior from Tucson, Ariz., said on Saturday, the last day of coaching before the students performed for judges behind closed doors on Sunday. Ms. Chico said the group had formed close bonds during the week.I dont look at it as competition, she said, echoing others. Its being with a group of people who are not just from my little town. We talk about our favorite food, our favorite app.As part of the weeks program, the students received an hour of media training from the Broadway publicist Chris Boneau, who told them, among other things, that journalists werent their friends, and that if they wanted to look vulnerable while answering a tough question, to take off their glasses in the middle. Also, to smile  and to be careful about their Facebook posts.Ms. Chico, who aspires to be an animator for Disney, said she was not viewing the Monday night performance as a springboard for a Broadway career.My hopes are to be confident and walk down the street and know I can do anything, she said. Musical theater gives my personality a place to go, so Im not just being loud in some inappropriate place, like a library.On Monday morning, the students took their first steps on the Minskoff stage, which is normally home to The Lion King. Some, like Mark Mitrano, 16, a sophomore from Greece Athena High School in Rochester, cried when they looked out at the house. It was unbelievable that they could make this happen, he said.Ms. Lalama, the choreographer, squeezed Mr. Brewingtons face with her thumbs and kissed him on the cheek. Hes my baby squinchy, she said. I wish I could take him home.Cellphones were not permitted onstage, but the teenagers did not seem to mind. During downtime, they talked in small groups, sprawled over one another or gave back rubs.J. R. Heckman, 15, a freshman from Cleveland and the youngest boy in the group, was unabashedly star-struck, both by his fellow students and his coach, the Broadway performer Howard McGillin. To get personal feedback from the Phantom of the Opera is amazing, he said.After the ceremony, Ms. Faye reunited with her high school teachers and family members and tried to catch her breath.Expectations were really high, she said. I found myself thinking, oh my goodness, I cant do this. The hardest part was the perseverance, to just keep going when you havent gotten any sleep."}
{"text": "In 2005, as he was making a transition from developing real estate to capitalizing on his fame through ventures like a reality show and product-licensing deals, Donald J. Trump hit upon a two-pronged strategy for entering the field of for-profit education.He poured his own money into Trump University, which began as a distance-learning business advising customers on how to make money in real estate, but left a long trail of customers alleging they were defrauded. Their lawsuits have cast a shadow over Mr. Trumps presidential campaign.But Mr. Trump also lent his name, and his credibility, to a seminar business he did not own, which was branded the Trump Institute. Its operators rented out hotel ballrooms across the country and invited people to pay up to $2,000 to come hear Mr. Trumps wealth-creating secrets and strategies.And its customers had ample reason to ask whether they, too, had been deceived.As with Trump University, the Trump Institute promised falsely that its teachers would be handpicked by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump did little, interviews show, besides appear in an infomercial  one that promised customers access to his vast accumulated knowledge. I put all of my concepts that have worked so well for me, new and old, into our seminar, he said in the 2005 video, adding, Im teaching what Ive learned.Reality fell far short. In fact, the institute was run by a couple who had run afoul of regulators in dozens of states and had been dogged by accusations of deceptive business practices and fraud for decades. Similar complaints soon emerged about the Trump Institute.Yet there was an even more fundamental deceit to the business, unreported until now: Extensive portions of the materials that students received after paying their seminar fees, supposedly containing Mr. Trumps special wisdom, had been plagiarized from an obscure real estate manual published a decade earlier.Together, the exaggerated claims about his own role, the checkered pasts of the people with whom he went into business and the theft of intellectual property at the ventures heart all illustrate the fiction underpinning so many of Mr. Trumps licensing businesses: Putting his name on products and services  and collecting fees  was often where his actual involvement began and ended.That Trump Institute, what criminals they are, said Carol Minto of West Haven, Conn., a retired court reporter who attended one seminar in 2009 and agreed to spend $1,997.94 to attend another before having second thoughts. She wound up requiring the help of two states attorneys general in getting a refund. They wanted to steal my money, she said.The institute was another example of the Trump brands being accused of luring vulnerable customers with false promises of profit and success. Others, besides Trump University, include multilevel marketing ventures that sold vitamins and telecommunications services, and a vanity publisher that faced hundreds of consumer complaints.Mr. Trumps infomercial performance suggested he was closely overseeing the Trump Institute. People are loving it, he said in the program, titled The Donald Trump Way to Wealth and staged like a talk show in front of a wildly enthusiastic audience. People are really doing well with it, and theyre loving it. His name, picture and aphorisms like I am the American Dream, supersized version were all over the course materials.Yet while he owned 93 percent of Trump University, the Trump Institute was owned and operated by Irene and Mike Milin, a couple who had been marketing get-rich-quick courses since the 1980s.A Trump executive, Michael Sexton, told The Sacramento Bee in 2006 that there was a simple reason for going into business with the Milins: Their company was the best in the business.Yet the Milins reputation was actually pockmarked with lawsuits and regulatory actions  a dismal track record that Mr. Trump and his aides could have unearthed with a modicum of due diligence.The Milins were known for running full-page ads that screamed FREE MONEY! and offered tutorials on how to obtain government grants and loans. They were also notorious for being frequent targets of state regulators.In 1993, the Texas attorney general accused their company, then called Information Seminars International, of taking customers money and running. People who bought a $499 Milin Method package were promised financing to resell real estate purchased at government auctions, officials said, but when customers sought to follow up with the company, the Milins had vanished.In 2001, operating as National Grants Conference, the Milins settled with Florida authorities after being accused of violating the states Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. And in 2006, the Vermont attorney general sued the Milins for consumer fraud, ultimately fining them $65,000 and allowing customers to seek more than $325,000 in refunds.The regulatory woes continued after the Milins rebranded their seminar business with the name of the countrys best-known real estate developer: In 2007, 33 state attorneys general signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the Milins of deceptive trade practices. A year later, their company sought bankruptcy protection, owing $2.1 million to creditors. The venture continued for a few years.Alan Garten, Mr. Trumps in-house counsel, said that executives were unaware of the Milins history when their business relationship began but that he could not recall when they became aware of the couples run-ins with regulators.Operating as the Trump Institute, the Milins pursued familiar tactics  and attracted familiar complaints, eventually earning an F from the Better Business Bureau.Seminar attendees who later sought assistance from supposed experts over a Trump Institute toll-free phone line complained of being told to ignore what they had been taught in the seminars because it was outdated or useless advice. The advisers refused to listen to us when we referred to the methods taught in the seminars, Fred and Zofia Besel, a retired couple from New York, wrote in 2009, seeking a refund in a letter that wound up with the Florida attorney generals office.Unbeknownst to customers at the time, though, even the printed materials handed out to seminar attendees were based on a lie. The Trump Institute copyrighted its publication, each page emblazoned with Billionaires Road Map to Success, and it distributed the materials to those who attended the seminars.Yet much of the handbooks contents were lifted without attribution from an obscure how-to guide published by Success magazine in 1995 called Real Estate Mastery System.At least 20 pages of the Trump Institute book were copied entirely or in large part from Real Estate Mastery System. Even some of its hypothetical scenarios  Seller A is asking $80,000 for a single-family residence  were repeated verbatim.Asked about the plagiarism, which was discovered by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge, the editor of the Trump Institute publication, Susan G. Parker, denied responsibility and suggested that a lawyer for the Milins, who provided her with background material for the book, might have been to blame.The lawyer, Peter Hoppenfeld, who no longer represents the Milins, said Ms. Parker was most likely at fault but acknowledged forwarding her information from the Milins office. Reached at her home in Boca Raton, Fla., Irene Milin told a reporter, Im very busy, and hung up. She did not answer subsequent calls or respond to a voice mail message.Mr. Garten said Mr. Trump was obviously not aware of the plagiarism. But even while playing down Mr. Trumps link to the Trump Institute, calling it a short-term licensing deal, Mr. Garten expressed pride in the venture. I stand by the curriculum that was taught at both Trump University and Trump Institute, he said.Ms. Parker, a lawyer and legal writer in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said that far from being handpicked by Mr. Trump, she had been hired to write the book after responding to a Craigslist ad. She said she never spoke to Mr. Trump, let alone received guidance from him on what to write. She said she drew on her own knowledge of real estate and a speed-reading of Mr. Trumps books.Ms. Parker said she did venture to one of the Trump Institute seminars  and was appalled: The speakers came off like used-car salesmen, she said, and their advice was nothing but banalities. It was like I was in sleaze America, she said. It was all smoke and mirrors."}

{"text": "LARAMIE, Wyo.  When the debate over allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice rolled into town like a high-plains thunderstorm, Laramies school board took its own multiple-choice test.It faced two competing proposals. The first would let transgender students use the bathrooms matching their gender identity, aligning Laramie with the Obama administration and liberal activists. Under the second option, anatomy would dictate, appeasing conservative parents and religious groups.It was a tough call in a community that is one part liberal college town and one part conservative Wyoming range, where some church signs cite Scripture while others quote the musician Prince. People still visit a memorial to Matthew Shepard, the gay University of Wyoming student who was murdered nearby in 1998.The transgender debate here brought dozens of parents, students and residents to speak at school board meetings. Advocates on both sides gathered petition signatures. Emails poured in to the superintendent, some advocating equality and others warning of predators in the bathrooms.Ultimately, the school district chose none of the above.There was an expectation from the public: Pick one, said Jubal C. Yennie, superintendent of Albany County District 1 in southern Wyoming. We dont need to make a case one way or the other that draws a distinction.More than a month after the Obama administration issued sweeping guidelines telling schools how to accommodate transgender students, battle lines are hardening. After emotional public meetings, schools in places like Highland Park, N.J., and Fairfax County, Va., have expanded protections for transgender students. But in 11 states, conservative governors and attorneys general are suing the administration, trying to block what they call a massive social experiment in school bathrooms and locker rooms across the country.Caught in the middle are ambivalent school systems like Laramies, hesitant to pass new policies that could ignite outrage or lawsuits from either side.Do we need to be writing federal law? No, Dr. Yennie asked. The answer is, Lets have a conversation.He said the district was happy to call transgender students by their preferred names and pronouns. He also said school administrators would talk with transgender students individually to find a bathroom or locker room that fit. In the wake of the debate, the district was adding more gender-neutral bathrooms to a new $90 million high school it is building.Many schools dont actually want to put a policy in place, said John Knight, who directs litigation surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity issues in the Midwest for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. But for individual students, they are treating them with respect and allowing them access to restrooms.Rihanna Kelver, a recent Laramie High School graduate with teal-streaked hair and newfound political ambition, spent the last six months putting out petitions and speaking at board meetings to urge Laramies schools to adopt a policy that would formally allow students like her to use the school facilities where they felt comfortable.She began living as a girl in her junior year in high school, and after conversations with her school principal, she used a single restroom designated for women at a far corner of the high school. Eventually, she just started using the girls bathrooms.I was a female in the restroom, she said. That was it.She said she never encountered opposition for using the bathroom she wanted. But when the school board started to weigh formal policies last September, a monthslong debate erupted. The district set up a committee to study the issue, and so many parents began coming to once sedate school board meetings that the district had to set up an overflow room.This has turned into a hot potato, said Ken Cramer, a school board member who supports extending equal protections to transgender students.Wyoming, nicknamed the Equality State, embraced the right to vote for women decades before the 19th Amendment passed. So far, it has not joined conservative states in suing the Obama administration, nor has it adhered to liberal states in passing antidiscrimination laws that encompass gender identity and sexual orientation. At the same time, its streak of Western independence resists federal involvement.Jillian Balow, the states superintendent of public instruction, criticized the Obama administrations guidelines as a sweeping federal mandate that brushed aside efforts by local schools to address what she called a sensitive topic. In a letter to schools, she criticized the guidelines as a sweeping edict.Some parents said they were just starting to learn about transgender issues and resented Washingtons intervention.In Wyoming, were just having the community start a discussion, said Suzanne Spiker-Miller, the mother of an incoming seventh-grader and a high school senior. It feels like they dont have any faith in the communities to come up with something. It was like: Were just going to tell you what to do.Ms. Spiker-Millers older daughter, Rio, said she and her friends first started discussing the topic of gender identity and public restrooms on a volleyball team trip. She said that she wanted transgender classmates to feel safe and comfortable, but that she would be uncomfortable changing in the same locker room as someone with male private parts.Locker rooms are awkward anyways, she said. Its scary for me as a girl, having that potential for a perverted guy to come in. You get those guys, especially in high school. There would always be that potential.Parents and other residents who supported the anatomy-centered policy urged the board to set aside gender-neutral restrooms. Some said that the needs of a tiny minority of students  experts estimate that 0.3 percent of the population is transgender  should not reshape policy for the entire district. Others wondered why the issue was commanding so much attention.I feel like the school board has a lot more important issues than where people are going to the bathroom, said Heather Larson, the mother of four boys and two girls. We tell kids no all the time: No you cant spit on the lockers, no you cant use your phones. Kids are used to following rules in a school, and I dont think telling people where they have to go to the bathroom is heartbreaking.The school districts decision to punt on the issue disappointed students and parents who had been pushing for equal protections to become a written policy. Ms. Kelver, the recent high school graduate, has announced she is running for school board and said she would make gender issues a central focus of her campaign.Its a tough situation, she said. People want to say were the aggressors, that were the ones who want to do harm unto people, that were just pushing our agenda. Its just me wanting to survive."}
{"text": "FRIDAY PUZZLE  You know a solve is going to be tough when your very first gimme is a misdirection about foreign currency (RIALS). I hope this doesnt mean were going to have a tough solving holiday weekend.Did anyone else have a hard time with this themeless  by James Mulhern? I thought it was fair, but it needed substantial wrestling to make it fall. That long crossing, FANTASY BASEBALL/SQUARE BRACKET, is spectacular, but sometimes you get the Friday grid and sometimes the Friday grid gets you.Throughout most of the puzzle, I found I was off by one letter  a misspelling here (ARGUS instead of ARGOS), a bad guess there (AMC instead of TMC), but I managed to finish by working those crossings mercilessly. I found that I worked my way from the outside of the puzzle to the center, which resisted me, particularly at the crossings of SULU SEA/STUPA and YAZOO/MOCHA. At 33A, I had YA_OO and talked myself out of the assumption that somewhere in the United States there might be a YAHOO River. Fortunately, I was able to take a really good guess at the ZAC Brown band at 34D to come up with YAZOO.Lets take a closer look at a few of the more difficult clues: 15A: Im not crazy about the entry, but if you have a job that can be done by only one person, some people might call that a ONE MAN job. 16A: To balance out 15A, we have AIRWOMAN, which is clued as Amelia Earhart, e.g. 25A: Ive been solving long enough to know when Im being asked to think outside the box even when there is no question mark, but the ? is a good hint. Your first thought about the clue Dough made in the Middle East? might have been about pita bread, but the answer today is RIALS, the currency of a few countries in the Middle East. 30A: Heres a mindblower: The opposite of even is not odd. Its MORN, especially if you are a poet and are writing poetry MORN, noon and even. 35A: If you look at your keyboard, youll see that the neighbor of a backslash is the SQUARE BRACKET, which makes its New York Times Crossword debut today. As an entry, I mean. Weve had square brackets in the crossword as a clue before. 39A: Vocabulary test! A STUPA is a Buddhist religious monument in the shape of a dome, that may contain relics or the remains of monks. 44A: Today, I learned the sports term ISO, which is short for ISOlation, or one-on-one basketball play. And to think that I thought it was just an online dating term (In Search Of). 47A: Foreign language clue alert!: Poems rhyme, so a feature of un poema (Spanish for poem) is una RIMA (rhyme). 59A: The light blue partner of Connecticut and Vermont is ORIENTAL if you happen to be playing a game of Monopoly. 6D: Were not actually rapping in the modern sense of the word today. Were rapping on a door, and the answer, ENTER, always makes me think of the scene in The Sunshine Boys where they rehearse the Doctor sketch and argue over whether the first word should be ENTER! or Come in!-12D: Do What key is this musical piece in? clues confound you? Im a great lover of music, but not a musician, so I have to cobble these clues together. First, I try to determine if the answer is going to be __ MAJOR or __ MINOR. Today, I had the -JOR at the end of the clue from 22-, 26- and 30A, so I knew the answer was __ MAJOR. Then I just needed to fill in 7A, FLASHERS, which was thankfully clued as Drivers hazards, and the answer turns out to E MAJOR.-24D: I had not heard of the SULU SEA prior to today, so Im moving that to the Now I Know side of my slate. Its making a reappearance in the New York Times Crossword after 50 years, so welcome back. It has a nice consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, which makes it ripe for crosswords. 36D: An absolute winner of a clue, in my opinion. An Aid in labor management? is an EPIDURAL. Why, what were you thinking? Industrial relations? 41D: Is LOLITAS a good entry for a puzzle in this day and age? Im not so sure. But the clue acknowledges that the usage is outdated, and thats a good start. 49D: Misdirection! Were not supposed to be thinking about collection agencies in the clue Bill collectors?; TILLS are where you keep the paper money or bills you collect. Reel Big Fish is a SKA band. Heres their song Sell Out:Did that help you get started? Were you stuck to begin with? Lay out your solve for me in the comments, and lets chat with Mr. Mulhern:I made this puzzle about two years ago. Its actually a rewrite; initially, I had a couple of answers (FLASH ART, AN ITEM) that Will and Joel rightly nixed, all of which led to the version you see today.As a big fantasy sports fan, I was happy to include the grid-spanning FANTASY BASEBALL, as well as some other fun fill.Hope this puzzle is a pleasant lead-in to a wonderful long weekend!Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "European leaders met in Brussels on Wednesday, but Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain was sent home early.Heres what is happening today in Brexit news: The leaders of 27 European Union countries are meeting in Brussels to discuss the British exit. Mr. Cameron showed up only briefly for a somber dinner on Tuesday, at which he told his fellow leaders that immigration was the main reason his compatriots had decided to leave the bloc.European leaders expressed alarm: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said there would be economic consequences to an exit; Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, said we all need to wake up and smell the coffee; and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium called Britains vote to withdraw a wake-up alarm.Britain will have to negotiate the terms of its divorce, but only after it formally files the separation papers  a task Mr. Cameron has left to his successor. Lawmakers from Britains governing party are jockeying to replace Mr. Cameron, with the process for choosing a new Conservative Party leader opening today. Nominations close at noon on Thursday.Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and a leader of the campaign to leave the European Union, is the favorite, but other possible candidates include Home Secretary Theresa May and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Rank-and-file members will choose between finalists selected by Conservative legislators. The opposition Labour Party is in turmoil. Jeremy Corbyn, the party leader, lost a no-confidence vote by his fellow lawmakers on Tuesday.And during the weekly grilling of the prime minister, Mr. Cameron angrily called on Mr. Corbyn to quit, handing him some of the blame for the Leave campaigns victory.It might be in my partys interest for him to sit there. Its not in the national interest, Mr. Cameron thundered. And I would say, for heavens sake man, go!(Mr. Camerons comment seems to be a nod to remarks by Oliver Cromwell in April 1653, when, having lost patience with Parliament, he said: You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!) Secretary of State John Kerry, like many observers, has noted that a British exit might  not even happen, a position that Gideon Rachman,  writing in The Financial Times, also took. (My colleague Max Fisher has laid out  some of the options if Britain wants to exit Brexit.) The London School of Economics has a blog post on how Britain could maneuver its way to a second referendum. If Boris Johnson  the bookies favorite  does take over as Conservative leader and, by extension, prime minister, what should he do? Martin Wolf offers advice in The Financial Times. Tina Brown, though, is no fan of Mr. Johnson. And Sarah Vine, a journalist and the wife of a Leave campaign leader, describes the hours after the referendum result became clear. In The Timess opinion pages, Paul Anderson writes that Mr. Cameron may have held the referendum to heal rifts in the Conservative Party, yet the result caused a schism in Labour. Thomas L. Friedman says the vote is not the end of the world  but it does show us how we can get there. And Sarfraz Manzoor notes that London and the rest of England are very different places. Thousands  gathered in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday evening to protest the results of the referendum.Most London voters favored staying in the European Union. At the protest, the mood was one of frustration. Will Hudson, a 30-year-old management consultant, said he felt he had to be out on the streets. Dominic Boyce, a 25-year-old drummer, said he felt let down by humanity. And Stephen Lock, a 64-year-old business consultant, described it as a total tragedy. The markets look to be recovering  or is it a dead cat bounce?The FTSE 100 index appears to have recovered all of its Brexit-related losses. After falling sharply in the wake of the referendum result announcement Friday morning, the London exchange closed at 6,360.06 on Wednesday. And the pound is up, after falling to three-decade lows on Monday."}
{"text": "LONDON  Be brave, Jussi Pylkkanen, Christies global president, urged the crowd at Wednesday evenings postwar and contemporary art sale as he began taking bids for one of two works by Jean-Michel Basquiat.At least one seller clearly wasnt feeling intrepid, withdrawing the sales top lot, Gerhard Richters Abstraktes Bild (811-2), a 1994 painting estimated at about $19 million, just before the auction. Or perhaps Christies was unable to generate enough interest in that piece, which did not have a guarantee.Still, the cautious sense of Brexit-proof resilience in the art market that surfaced at Sothebys auction on Tuesday and at Phillipss sale on Monday was also clear at Christies 39-lot auction. The sale brought a total of 39.6 million pounds, or $52.8 million, compared with a presale estimate of $35.1 million to $50 million.Wednesday nights mood was particularly buoyed by the flurry of bidding for the Basquiats.Eight works by the urban artist, who died in 1988, had been consigned to Christies by the actor Johnny Depp (six will be auctioned at Christies day sale on Thursday). The first of the group, a 1981 self-portrait made of paint and paper on three hinged wooden panels, sold Wednesday after heated bidding for 3.5 million pounds, or $4.7 million, to Acquavella Galleries, well exceeding its high estimate of $1.9 million.And the artists Pork from the same year, painted on a door, sold for 5.1 million, or $6.8 million, to a telephone bidder competing with an unidentified woman at the back of the room. This price, the highest of the evening, surpassed the high estimate of $4.4 million.William Acquavella, who said he purchased the Basquiat self-portrait to sell at his gallery, added that caution persists in the market. There just isnt that much quality  pickings are slim  but its been like this for a while, he said. The auction houses arent offering as many guarantees and dealers are doing more privately. Sellers dont want to take the risk. Its a volatile time, and people need the assurance of getting the price they want.The auction started out strong with Adrian Ghenies Dr. Mengele a 2011 oil on canvas that is part of a series by the painter depicting the notorious Nazi doctor at Auschwitz. It sold for 398,500, or about $530,300.(Final prices include the buyers premium: 25 percent of the first 100,000; 20 percent of the next 100,000 to 2 million; and 12 percent of the rest. The presale estimates do not reflect commissions.)Other high points included Sean Scullys Eve, an oil on three attached canvases that sold for 902,500, or $1.2 million.Christies said at a postsale news conference that the auction drew bidders from 39 countries across four continents, including many participants from Asia. Ten of the lots sold to buyers in Britain, which has been buffeted by last weeks referendum result calling for the nation to exit from the European Union. The response was very global, said Brett Gorvy, Christies worldwide chairman for postwar and contemporary art.Asian bidding was across the scale on artists like Basquiat, Ghenie and Scully, he said. We havent seen that up to now.There were surprises. Francis Outred, Christies European head of postwar and contemporary art, said he had anticipated that Andy Warhols Two Dollar Bills would sell to an American because of the cheap dollar. Instead, it went to a British-based buyer for $5.9 million."}
{"text": "Over 300 million people visited the national parks system in 2015  and many left with indelible memories. In anticipation of the park system turning 100 in August, we asked five writers  three novelists, a memoirist and a poet  to recount times when a national park left a mark on their lives.All my life, from my earliest memories, Ive known of a semi-mythic place called the Tetons. Until I was a grown-up, I never quite knew where it was. In my mind, it exists solely in the past, as a state of being. It is inextricably linked to my family, back in those hazy, long-ago golden early days when we were a family: a mother, a father and three sisters.I remember jagged, snow-peaked mountains and a clear stream rushing over rounded rocks; the soft flannel lining of my sleeping bag, and the roof of my mouth burned by charred hot dogs and roasted marshmallows. I remember my two little sisters playing in the shade, our laughing, beautiful young mother gazing at the view, and our father, who taught us songs and made us laugh and let us ride on his shoulders. At home, he could erupt into sudden violence or disappear into cold abstraction, but on camping trips, he was warm, charming, fun.We lived in Berkeley, Calif., in those days. Going to the Tetons  which are, in fact, in western Wyoming  meant a very, very long drive. I remember sleeping with my little sisters in the way-back of our 1955 Chevy station wagon, the Green Queen. I can hear fragments of the songs we sang together as we drove: In Dublins fair city, roses love sunshine, oh my darling Clementine.The Tetons meant waking up to my parents drinking cowboy coffee from tin camping mugs, shadows of pine boughs on the canvas tent wall, the fresh breeze blowing through the screen mesh window. It meant sitting by the campfire at night on stumps, singing, telling stories, watching fiery sparks soar up to the stars. The Tetons meant my parents were still together, my family still intact, with none of the future violent ruptures and rifts among the five of us from which no one would be exempt and no bond unbroken.Going there ended in 1970, when we moved with our mother to Arizona and left our father behind in the Bay Area. We had more adventures, but they were different. Our father was always far away, and then he was simply gone from our lives. Remember the Tetons? Id say to my sisters, or theyd say to me. It was shorthand: What we meant was, Remember our romantic, Edenic early childhood?When I was 25, in 1987, my then-boyfriend and I drove cross-country together with a tent and sleeping bags and camping equipment. He wanted to see friends in Jackson Hole, so we decided to camp at the national park for a couple of nights. The Tetons, I said to him. I know them well.We arrived, pulled into our campsite, set up our tent. We built a campfire, roasted hot dogs, sang songs. We awoke to the shadows of pine boughs on the nylon wall. Drinking my tin camping mug of cowboy coffee, I gazed at the same view my mother had loved all those years ago: snowy jagged peaks, big sky. The Tetons, I said to myself, waiting to feel that same old magic again.The mountains shot up thousands of feet from the peaceful green valley with its shining river. The abrupt power of the mountains shocked me, a sudden, gigantic violence of sheer rock, without any undulating cushions of foothills to soften the rupture. Instead of happy nostalgia, I found a hard, bracing truth  born, perhaps, in a new apprehension of beauty. My boyfriend didnt love me nearly enough to make up for the loss of my father, and I didnt love him enough to fill the gaping melancholy I felt the whole time we stayed there. Although I didnt know it then, my adult life had just begun."}
{"text": "HOUSTON  Brexit, meet Texit.The stunning vote by Britain to exit the European Union has inspired a flurry of chatter on social media about what it might mean for Texas, that former nation where a devoted fringe element has long advocated for secession from the United States.Many of the states residents may have flirted with the idea, but the news out of Britain revived the debate, inspired a Texit hashtag and raised the hopes of the Texas secession movement.On Twitter, there were Texas-less maps of America, videos of head-shaking Jedis and calls for Gov. Greg Abbott to take action. Oddly, the Texan who staked his name on the cause  the former Larry Scott Kilgore, who legally changed his name to Larry Secede Kilgore and plans to run for governor in 2018  has not tweeted a word.Reached on his cellphone last week, Mr. Kilgore, 51, said Britains vote had uplifted the Texas movement.It was a form of secession, he said. I think the people of Texas will look at that and say: Man, we can have freedom; we can make our own decisions. We dont have to have the U.S. empire tell us what to do. And its not just Texas. Brexit has given a nudge to modest pre-existing secession movements in New England, as well. On Sunday, a small group of demonstrators gathered in Manchester, N.H. to support NHexit.And in Vermont, a secession movement, the Second Vermont Republic, wrote that it had received a surge of inquiries in the days after the Brexit referendum.Daniel Miller, the president of the Texas Nationalist Movement, an organization that says it has gathered more than 250,000 pledged votes in favor of secession by that state, has been tirelessly tweeting on behalf of the idea, directing many of his posts at Mr. Abbott.Jesse Kelly, who ran for Congress in Arizona in 2010 and 2012, has also been an enthusiastic proponent.Some outside the states borders have expressed enthusiasm for the idea.But others were less interested.And one Twitter user pushed the movement to take a different name.All of this, of course, could be tied back to Donald J. Trump, by none other than Mr. Trump himself, who told reporters in Scotland on Saturday that the state would never secede because Texas loves me.Despite the excitement online, there is no formal legal means under federal law that would allow Texas to secede. In 2013, the director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Jon Carson, said as much in a written response to an online secession petition.Our founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States in order to form a more perfect union through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government, Mr. Carson wrote.They enshrined in that document the right to change our national government through the power of the ballot  a right that generations of Americans have fought to secure for all. But they did not provide a right to walk away from it."}
{"text": "LONDON  The Bank of England may be forced to cut a key interest rate this summer as it grapples with economic uncertainty created by Britains vote to leave the European Union, Mark Carney, the banks governor, said in a speech on Thursday.The referendum result last week has led to sharp declines in the value of the pound against the dollar and has shaken the British political establishment. Separately, Standard & Poors lowered its rating on long-term European Union debt to AA, from AA+, citing the uncertainty after the British referendum results.The process to leave the European Union is expected to take years of negotiations and, in the short term, could put further pressure on the British economy, Mr. Carney said.It now seems plausible that uncertainty could remain elevated for some time, with a greater drag on activity than we had previously projected, Mr. Carney said. Moreover, its effects will be reinforced by tighter financial conditions and possible negative spillovers to growth in the U.K.s major trading partners.Mr. Carney said he believed that the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer.He said he was not prejudging what other members of the banks Monetary Policy Committee might decide at their next meeting in July or at their meeting in August, when the bank is to announce a new forecast for inflation.The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent since March 2009.Mr. Carney also sought to reassure investors, saying the central bank had several tools available to stabilize the market. He noted that Britains banks were much better capitalized than they were during the financial crisis and the bank had 250 billion pounds, or about $335 billion, available as a backstop to keep the market functioning.He also shrugged off a suggestion by a reporter that he might be forced to resign after a new prime minister was chosen.Some members of the campaign that backed a British exit from the European Union have accused Mr. Carney of politicizing the central bank before the referendum. The banks Financial Policy Committee said that the risks associated with the referendum were the most significant near-term domestic risks to financial stability.What we said in terms of the risk to the economic outlook, in terms of the risk to financial stability, does anyone in this room not think those risks have begun to manifest? he said. Does anyone in the country think those risks have not begun to manifest? So, we did our job. We identified the risk."}
{"text": "As they ambled through the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side last week, the Haim sisters  Tagel, Tair and Liron  made a playful detour. Stopping at a produce stand, Tagel lifted a pair of peppers to her ears.She was showing off her makeshift earrings when her siblings joined her. Tagel dropped the peppers and grinned wickedly as she hoisted two squash breast high; Liron lifted another, perfectly contoured to the line of her hips.Everything is natural, just like the shapes of our bodies, Tagel said, moving on to a bin lavishly piled with yellow and orange cherry tomatoes.The sisters (not to be confused with Haim, the California sister trio), in their late 20s and early 30s and known collectively as the music group A-Wa (Arabic for Yes!), had gathered the makings of a crazy salad. An unlikely fusion of disparate elements, it was something like their sound, a resolutely upbeat mixture of hip-hop and electro pop beats and the melodies of their Yemeni heritage.Relaxing before a performance at Webster Hall in the East Village, they darted past pyramids of fruit and shelves lined with exotic coffee blends and cheeses, dressed in a chaotic mash-up of flowing floral- and fruit-pattern skirts, which were nearly lost amid the gaily colored produce.Markets are always so colorful and diverse, Tagel said. You get to see stuff, smell it, touch it.Finishing her thought, Liron chimed in, They play on all your senses.Their music videos, too, encourage audiences to sample, absorb and practically inhale the sensations of the desert where the young women grew up. At its debut last year, their hit single, Habib Galbi, inspired by a Yemeni folk song and shot in the arid landscape of the Arava Valley in Israel, gained an international audience, including Europeans and Mipsterz (Muslim hipsters), and close to 3.7 million views on YouTube.The sisters distill and interpret the folk songs of their grandparents, singing in what they call Yemenite, a nearly extinct dialect of Arabic spoken by the Jews of Yemen.We werent sure how people were going to accept three young women bringing Yemeni music to the front stage, said Tair, the most robustly outspoken of the three. We didnt label ourselves as Yemeni Jews or anything else. We announced ourselves as a fresh sound from the desert.We wanted people to look at the video and feel no judgment, she added. We wanted to confuse them  in a good way.Their message, one of inclusion, is reinforced in their day-to-day lives by spontaneously generous, if unabashedly corny, gestures. We spread the love, Tair said of their habit of sending fans they know well videos to celebrate a wedding day, a graduation or a bar or bat mitzvah.She drove home the point, stopping with her sisters at a corner market on Rivington Street to buy sunflowers, and promptly distributed them to random passers-by.But enough. Before long, the three grew restless, peering avidly into shop windows, unable, finally, to resist the blandishments of Edith Machinist, a vintage store on Rivington. They popped in, slipped on shoes, plucked tunics from the racks and chattered in an animated mix of Hebrew and English peppered with Arabic phrases.I feel like one of Cinderellas stepsisters, Tair said, grumbling good-naturedly as she tried to wedge her feet into a pair of minuscule flats.I love all the  how do you call them?  Oxford shoes, Tagel said. Alongside her, Liron checked her reflection, holding aloft a tiger-pattern top.Its very light, like a kimono, she said.In a matter of seconds, she had sprinted toward the front of the shop to pose gamely for her sisters in an old-fashion-looking DKNY straw cloche. I like it, Tair said, coaxing, Make like Jane from Tarzan and Show your bangs, girl.Parched from their hectic shopping rounds, the three, joined by their stylist Ron Ben Nun, retreated to the home of Michelle Caputo, a television producer and friend, settling on her palmy terrace on the Lower East Side to sample wine and cheese. The conversation returned to their sound, which incorporates shards of Motown, Ella Fitzgerald and North African beats.In their music, as in their look, We are not just one thing, Tair said. Were saying, Its O.K. to celebrate the many parts of who you are.Their style, Ms. Ben Nun acknowledged, is laden with symbolism. A pattern of prickly pears swarmed over Tagels floor-length dress. They are Sabra, she said, referring simultaneously to the desert flower and the native-born Israelis who bear its name.And what of those other three musical sisters who share their last name? We like Haim and would love to meet them, they said nearly in unison. People think were related, Tair said. Theyre not.But then, as she was prompt to interject, We are all related."}
{"text": "WIMBLEDON, England  The last time Juan Martn del Potro was on Centre Court at Wimbledon, he was trading blows with Novak Djokovic during a classic five-set semifinal in 2013.After three operations on his left wrist, del Potro no longer has the pop on his backhand that he did on that day three years ago.But he is a Grand Slam champion and a former top-five player, and if his body could just stay together to hold his prodigious talent, more great moments would come.Del Potro created one on Friday, when he was back on Centre Court defeating another Grand Slam champion, fourth-seeded Stan Wawrinka, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (2), 6-3, in a second-round match.The win was del Potros most significant since he returned from his third operation in February.But winning was almost beside the point. While he was recovering from surgery at home in Argentina, del Potro, 27, said that he was really sad and that he missed the game. On Friday, he was on tenniss grandest stage again, with the support of an adoring crowd.I was so happy on court, he said in a BBC interview after the match. It doesnt matter the score.He added: My hand is shaking. Its a great sensation for me. I feel alive.The match was the first between two Grand Slam champions in the second round at Wimbledon since Djokovic lost to Marat Safin in 2008. It was also only the second time in two and a half years that del Potro had faced a top-10 player.Del Potro, the 2009 United States Open champion, used to be a top-10 player himself, having achieved a career-high ranking of fourth in January 2014, two months before the first operation on his wrist.He had not played a Grand Slam tournament since and had adjusted his expectations accordingly.I couldnt expect to be in the third round of Wimbledon after three years, said del Potro, now ranked 165th.Friday began like so many other days this week, with rain falling and the outside courts covered with tarps. Play started late and was very brief. Dustin Brown and Nick Kyrgios played all of three points in their second-round match on Court No. 2 before they packed up and went back inside.It has been that kind of week at Wimbledon. With few matches to watch, fans at the All England Club resorted to cheering the sun.When it appeared on Friday afternoon, tournament officials scrambled to get the second round of singles completed to avoid having matches on Sunday, the traditional off day.But with two more rain delays in the early evening and four second-round matches unfinished, officials announced that matches would be played on the middle Sunday for the fourth time in tournament history and the first time since 2004.Venus Williams and Daria Kasatkina were left in an awkward position by the frequent stoppages. After the first set of their third-round match was started and stopped several times, an early evening shower came just as Williams had earned a match point at 7-6 in the third set.I cant say that Ive ever had a rain delay at match point, said the eighth-seeded Williams, at 36 the oldest woman in the draw.When the players returned to the court about an hour later, Williams hit a backhand into the net to end a five-shot rally and went on to lose the game. She closed out the match four games later, winning, 7-5, 4-6, 10-8.For largely uninterrupted play, one needed a ticket to Centre Court, and fans there got their moneys worth, capped off by Roger Federers 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Dan Evans of Britain.After del Potro dispatched Wawrinka, top-seeded Serena Williams dueled with her fellow American Christina McHale, rallying from a break down in the third set to win, 6-7 (7), 6-2, 6-4.Williams had a set point at 5-4 in the first set, but a McHale shot that had been called out was reversed after a challenge. McHale won the point when they replayed it and went on to win the set.Williams spent part of the ensuing changeover beating the ground with her racket.I was just really, really, really angry, she said. I had a lot of chances. She got really lucky on some shots. She just was playing great. I was a little disappointed in myself at that point.In the second set, she took out her frustration on McHale, a 24-year-old from New Jersey who is ranked 65th. But McHale broke Williams in the second game of the third set, putting Williams in warrior mode, as Jim Courier called it on the BBC broadcast.With McHale serving at 2-0, 40-15, Williams reeled off 11 straight points to get back on serve and had three break-point chances to go up, 3-2. McHale, who had lost a three-set match to Williams in Miami this year, fought back with a gutsy hold.But Williams got a break four games later for a 5-4 lead, and with the path to the third round on her racket, she hit three aces to end the match.There were times where I was down and out, she said. I just kept fighting. Thats what I know I can do best. I knew that I could count on that, rely on that.She could even joke about the broken racket once the win was secured. She signed it and gave it to a fan after the match.I look at it like I didnt crack one at the French Open or Rome, so I was doing really good, she said. I dont want to go too long without cracking a racket.There was no great escape for Wawrinka, who was the highest-seeded man to lose, after seven seeded players were eliminated Thursday. Wawrinka, who won the 2014 Australian Open and the 2015 French Open, had never advanced past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. He had added the former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek to his team to help him with his grass-court play.Wawrinka said he was not playing completely free, not playing aggressive enough.Del Potro remains a strong server, and his forehand, one of the great weapons in tennis, seems close to its old self, too. The wrist operations most affected his two-handed backhand, forcing him to use a one-handed slice most of the time.Del Potro had only one backhand winner in two matches. It was not a power blast from the past, but a two-hander that landed short and took an odd bounce.But the fluky winner gave del Potro match point. He converted it when Wawrinka hit a backhand shot wide, which served as an appropriate ending.Wawrinkas one-handed backhand has been among the games best, but he had 21 unforced errors and only seven winners from that side in the match. He had 48 unforced errors over all and five double faults, including one that gave del Potro the only break of the second set.After the biggest victory of his comeback, del Potro spoke of a more distant future. He said he believed his best could come in the next year, not in the next round.I know how far I am from my high level, he said. Ive been working hard to be 100 percent on next season."}
{"text": "MUMBAI, India  He does not act the part. At 76, Subramanian Swamy has a youthful demeanor, is frequently cheeky but is almost always composed. Yet he is arguably the most vicious infighter in Indian politics, where he has spent a career of more than 40 years taking down ministers and governments. Lately, he has been on a roll.First, he drove out Indias central bank chief.Next he set his sights on the chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry.Then he made a veiled attack on the finance minister for wearing a business suit on a trip to China instead of traditional Indian garb, saying he looked like a waiter.In the process, Mr. Swamy, an economist, has become the subject of intense controversy, an unapologetic Hindu nationalist whose antics are increasingly threatening the stability of the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now, the question is whether Mr. Modi will be able to keep him on a tight enough leash to prevent him from cannibalizing his government.Before his latest forays, he was the chief wrecker of the government in 1999, under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, causing its fall after 13 months, said Sudheendra Kulkarni, a close adviser to Mr. Vajpayee.Theyll face the worst consequences from tolerating him, Mr. Kulkarni said. Hell be a great spoiler.Not only has Mr. Modi tolerated Mr. Swamy, he has actively promoted him, rescuing him from the political wilderness by elevating him to a seat in the upper house of Parliament. The reason, political observers say, is Mr. Swamys value as one of Indias most effective fighters against the countrys endemic corruption, something that Mr. Modi has made a centerpiece of his plans to modernize and invigorate Indias economy.If Modi is going to live up to his promise to clean up government, he needs Swamy, said Madhav Das Nalapat, a former editor of The Times of India and a friend of Mr. Swamys.In an interview in his New Delhi office, where one wall is covered with pictures of himself with Indian leaders of recent decades, Mr. Swamy declared his latest attacks had the support of senior colleagues in the party and were made only after they told me, You are absolutely right. The son of a government bureaucrat, Mr. Swamy was raised in New Delhi but left in 1962 to pursue a doctorate in economics at Harvard, the beginning of a nearly 50-year affiliation with the university, as an associate professor and summer lecturer.In 1969, after obtaining his degree and teaching at Harvard for several years, he returned to India, hoping to build an academic career there. But as an outspoken advocate of free-market economics, he found himself shut out of the intelligentsia, then rabidly leftist.Unable to find a permanent place in Indias top academic institutions, Mr. Swamy was contemplating a return to the United States when he fell in with a Hindu nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party.My critics began saying I was a chauvinist, nationalist, mad nationalist, Mr. Swamy said, prompting the Hindu nationalist group to begin wondering,  Who is this guy who is speaking our language and we dont even know him? The group offered Mr. Swamy a seat in the upper house of Parliament in 1974. He took it, beginning his career in politics.Over the years, Mr. Swamy has served five terms in Parliament for two different parties that have since become part of Mr. Modis governing party. He settled into a routine of spending winters in India and summers teaching at Harvard.His Harvard chapter came to an abrupt end in late 2011, when he wrote a newspaper article after a series of militant attacks in Mumbai. The article called for the demolition of 300 mosques, some built over temples, and argued that Muslims should be barred from voting in India unless they acknowledged their Hindu ancestry. The article led Harvards faculty to cancel his summer course offerings.Mr. Swamy, in an interview, was unapologetic about the article and restated his theory of Muslims in India being descended from Hindus. He added that he wished the Harvard faculty had at least given him a chance to make his case before canceling his courses.Few who know him say they believe he is really anti-Muslim, suggesting that his comments are aimed at building a support base among Hindu nationalists. Swamy is a closet secularist, Mr. Nalapat said. Otherwise, how do you explain his family?Mr. Swamys wife, Roxna, is a member of the Parsi community, which emigrated centuries ago from Iran. One of his sons-in-law is Muslim.Whatever his role in Hindu nationalism, Mr. Swamy has been a force behind some of Indias landmark corruption cases. He petitioned the Supreme Court in 2010 to prosecute the telecommunications minister at the time over his involvement in awarding cellphone spectrum to companies below market rates. That helped fuel the perception of widespread corruption and led to the defeat of Indias longtime governing Congress Party.He also brought a lawsuit against several Congress Party leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, its president, and Rahul Gandhi, her son and the party vice president, accusing them of illegally acquiring a newspaper for its real estate assets and forcing them to show up in a New Delhi courthouse as the accused and post bail.Everyone thought that nothing could nail the Gandhi family, said Sanjaya Baru, a onetime spokesman for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Swamy showed its possible.Lately, Mr. Swamy has taken his battles beyond the courthouse to social media, where he has nearly three million Twitter followers. He typically rises at 4 a.m. and, over a cup of coffee, unleashes a torrent of attacks on the platform. Before turning in at night, he sends out another round of bullets from his Twitter gun.In April, as the question of whether Raghuram G. Rajan would continue as central bank governor was being debated, Mr. Swamy leapt into the mix. In an open letter to the prime minister, he accused the bank governor of an apparently deliberate attempt to wreck the Indian economy by refusing to lower interest rates, which would have made it cheaper for small and medium-size companies to get loans.Not content to attack Mr. Rajan on interest rates, a genuine policy choice, Mr. Swamy also questioned his loyalty to his country. Citing the bank governors possession of a United States green card, allowing him to work and reside there, Mr. Swamy suggested that Mr. Rajan was mentally not fully Indian.Mr. Rajan has not publicly commented on his decision to step down, but his parents told the newspaper The Indian Express that their son had been hurt by the attack  and the governments failure to rise to his defense.Mr. Swamy is convinced that without his attack, Mr. Rajan would have gotten an extension, because he had supporters and it would have been easy to follow the path of least resistance and allow him to stay in the job.Mr. Rajans departure seemed to energize Mr. Swamy, who found a new target in Arvind Subramanian, the Finance Ministrys chief economic adviser. Dredging up testimony before a United States congressional committee from several years earlier, in which he was critical of Indias policy on intellectual property, Mr. Swamy again raised questions about loyalty and tweeted, Sack him.Within days, he also posted on Twitter what appeared to be an attack on the finance minister, Arun Jaitley. Minutes after Mr. Jaitley appeared on Indian television dressed in a suit and tie on a visit to China, Mr. Swamy posted: BJP should direct our Ministers to wear traditional and modernised Indian clothes while abroad. In coat and tie they look like waiters.Later, as the Indian news media reported increasing unease in the Bharatiya Janata Party about his comments, he protested that he had not been referring to Mr. Jaitley, who looked very smart in a coat.Four days later, Mr. Modi, in a rare interview on Indian television, denounced Mr. Swamys attacks as inappropriate and publicity stunts, saying, the nation wont benefit from such behavior. Too late for Mr. Rajan and his supporters, he rose to the central bank governors defense, saying, I believe Raghuram Rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours.If Mr. Swamy was chastened, he showed no signs of it. On Twitter, he made fun of Mr. Modis interviewer and fired off some new attacks on the Gandhi family."}
{"text": "This morning, my 3-year-old son asked what was going to happen after breakfast. I misheard, and launched into a disquisition on the political disturbances in Britain, the challenge of maintaining an integrated Europe and threats to the world economy in the wake of Brexit.Judging by the tenor of recent commentary, it was an understandable mistake.There happens to be an index measuring the extent of discussion of economic policy uncertainty in American newspapers, and it has risen sharply in recent days. The level is roughly comparable to the highest levels reached over recent decades  a period that included the turmoil of Sept. 11, the uncertainty of the Iraq war, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis.The Economic Policy Uncertainty index measures the share of articles in American newspapers that contain the word economic or economy, as well as either uncertain or uncertainty, in addition to at least one term relating to policy (legislation, deficit, regulation, Congress, Federal Reserve or White House).The three economics professors who compile the data  Scott Baker, Nick Bloom and Steven Davis  have shown that a rise in their index foreshadows lower investment, output and employment. To be sure, the recent spike in policy-related uncertainty is only a few days old, and spikes in this index are common and often transitory. It would most likely take a more enduring rise in uncertainty to undermine the economic recovery.As Menzie Chinn, a professor of economics and noted blogger, has pointed out, the rise is all the more remarkable, because it is based on American rather than European newspapers, and because it is focused on policy-related uncertainty, rather than economic uncertainty more generally.Another commonly watched index of uncertainty  the VIX index, which is a measure of expected volatility of leading stocks in the United States over the next 30 days  has also risen, but nowhere near as drastically. It could be that recent events concern newspaper reporters more than stock traders. The difference most likely also reflects the relative myopia of the VIX, which is focused only on those uncertainties expected to be resolved over the next 30 days.Concerns about Brexit, the changing nature of presidential politics and the success of populist movements are likely to take many years to be resolved."}
{"text": "Shortly after the Pentagon began allowing openly gay people to serve in the military in 2011, a small group of transgender veterans quietly began to plan for the next battle. They thought it would take 15 years, perhaps more, for the military to openly accept transgender people in uniform.It would be hard, they knew, to make the case that ending an anachronistic policy that labeled transgender people as perverts was not only morally right, but the smart thing to do. Transgender service members risked being fired for stepping forward and speaking up. But speak up they did, with enormous courage and a clear sense of what was fair for them  and right for the country they took an oath to protect.On Thursday, less than five years after the gay ban was lifted, transgender troops won the same right. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said he concluded that allowing transgender people to serve would make the military a fairer employer and a stronger institution.We have to have access to 100 percent of Americas population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified  and to retain them, Mr. Carter said in  announcing the new policy.Rules that are to go into effect this year will offer commanders and transgender troops clear guidance on matters ranging from medical treatment, access to restrooms, the use of pronouns and changes to a persons name and gender marker in military records. Critically, the new rules add gender identity as a protected category in the Pentagons equal opportunity policy.For transgender troops who are serving openly now, these changes lift a cloud of uncertainty that held back careers and gave them little recourse when they were subjected to discriminatory and sometimes hostile treatment.Under the new policy, the Pentagon intends to start admitting openly transgender recruits a year from now. But to be eligible to enlist, transgender individuals will have to show that they have been stable in their preferred gender for at least 18 months and have completed all the transition-related medical treatment they expect to have.This requirement sets an extraordinarily high bar. Transgender people often make decisions about medical treatment  which can include hormone replacement therapy and surgery  over the course of years. They should not be forced to affirm that they have completed a medical transition before enlisting if they are healthy and fit for the strenuous requirements of military life. Mr. Carter said that this part of the policy would be revised within two years, which will give the Defense Department an opportunity to establish more flexible guidelines.These welcome changes come too late for some, including leading advocates of the movement for open transgender service. Roughly a year ago, Jess Shipps, a 31-year-old Air Force veteran who quit the military to transition, committed suicide after becoming despondent because she was out of work and out of money. Others, like Landon Wilson, a Navy intelligence expert, managed to rebuild their lives and careers after being kicked out of the military in a manner that was cruel and undignified.Some senior military officials and a few members of Congress have expressed reservations about the new policy, questioning whether it was driven more by politics than by sound policy. They can put that question to rest by spending time with the transgender troops who are currently serving their country."}
{"text": "LONDON  Michael Gove made his case on Friday to become the next British prime minister, arguing that the new leader should be someone who had backed an exit from the European Union, while vowing to spend less than a third of what his Leave campaign had promised on the National Health Service.Mr. Gove spoke a day after he shocked Britain by announcing his candidacy in the Conservative Party competition, having promised to serve as campaign manager for Boris Johnson, the former London mayor seen as the front-runner for the post.Mr. Johnson, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign with Mr. Gove, has withdrawn his candidacy, making the home secretary, Theresa May, 59, the odds-on favorite. But Ms. May had quietly backed staying in the European Union, and Mr. Gove, the justice secretary, argued on Friday that he best represented the mood of the party and the country.Mr. Gove, 48, laid out his program in a long and slightly wandering speech in London, acknowledging that he possesses no glamour or charisma and that he did almost everything not to be a candidate for the leadership of this party.He said he was so very reluctant because I know my limitations. He added, Whatever charisma is I dont have it, whatever glamour may be I dont think anyone could ever associate me with it.But Mr. Gove, having betrayed Mr. Johnson, had to justify his decision. He listened to his heart, he said, and decided that running was the right thing to do.He portrayed himself as a politician of conviction who broke with Prime Minister David Cameron, a friend, over a longstanding belief that Britain could not be truly sovereign inside the European Union, and with Mr. Johnson because I came to realize this week that, for all Boriss formidable talents, he was not the right person for the task.Like Ms. May, who spoke in a polished opening of her candidacy on Thursday, Mr. Gove said that he would not begin the formal process of leaving the European Union until next year and would not hold an early election.He also said that controlling immigration to Britain was a goal, which would almost surely prevent Britain from retaining access to the duty-free single market of the bloc. He promised to end free movement, introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration, and bring numbers down.Money saved from leaving the European Union would be spent principally on the National Health Service, he said, pledging to spend 100 million pounds more a week, or about $133 million, by 2020.Before the referendum, the Leave campaign  bus had been emblazoned with a promise to spend 350 million a week on the N.H.S.  a pledge that it said was equivalent to the amount Britain sent to the European Union and one that it refused to abandon even when it was shown that the figure was bogus.Mr. Gove argued that he was the candidate for change, pointing to his experience as justice secretary and especially as education secretary, even though he became so unpopular in that post that Mr. Cameron moved him out of the job. That move was the source of great resentment from Mr. Gove and his wife, Sarah Vine, a journalist.Mr. Gove spoke of being an adopted child lucky to find loving parents in Aberdeen, Scotland, who instilled in him a belief in human potential. And Mr. Gove, through intelligence and hard work, rose to graduate from Oxford and join the nations political elite.Only five Conservative members of Parliament were in the audience, and Mr. Gove will need more support than that to emerge as a plausible prime minister and a real competitor to Ms. May. She is considered a safe continuity candidate who is to the right of Mr. Cameron but slightly to the left of Mr. Gove.Ms. May is not a natural politician or a glad-hander, but she has concentrated on doing her work. She has been generally praised for her six years as home secretary, one of the countrys most difficult jobs, in particular for standing up to the police unions and for pushing through antiterrorism legislation.Mr. Gove had little to say on Friday about the budget or the economy, which has taken a big hit from the vote for the British exit, known as Brexit, as the Treasury warned. During the campaign, he dismissed all such warnings as Project Fear and said that people in this country have had enough of experts.George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer and a friend of Mr. Goves, said in a speech of his own in Manchester on Friday that he would abandon his pledge to balance the budget by 2020, the end of this Parliament, because of the effect that the referendum would have on growth and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will continue to be tough on the deficit, but we must be realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of this decade, Mr. Osborne said.Few economists believed that Mr. Osborne would deliver a budget surplus so soon in any case, given the size of the deficit and the impolitic scale of the spending cuts or tax increases that would be required to achieve one.On Thursday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned that Britain was suffering economic post-traumatic stress from the referendum and that a downturn and possibly a recession were on the way.Mr. Carney said that he expected to order some monetary easing in the next few months to promote growth  in other words, a cut in interest rates.But the bank can only do so much. Monetary policy cannot immediately or fully offset the economic implications of a large, negative shock, he said.Had Mr. Cameron and the Remain campaign won the referendum, Mr. Osborne would have been seen as a potential successor for prime minister. Those hopes have evaporated, and there is speculation that he may support Mr. Gove. There are three other candidates: Stephen Crabb, a young lawmaker who is the work and pensions secretary; Liam Fox, a former defense secretary; and Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, a Leave campaigner who is fast picking up support.Conservatives will start winnowing the five candidates down to two in rolling votes, and then the 150,000 or so party members will choose between the final two, expected now to be Ms. May and Mr. Gove. A decision is likely to be announced on Sept. 9."}
